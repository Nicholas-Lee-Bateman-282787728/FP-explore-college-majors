1581569,4,B00005JP96,"All one has to do is read the first few chapters of a pulp detective novel to understand what Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" is like. The trailers and television ads are in no way accurate in terms of conveying the kind of movie it is. They led me to believe that it was a realistic and incredibly dark period piece. In reality, it's a heavily stylized reinterpretation of Film Noir classics, so much so that it almost comes off as campy. A fictionalized world is represented, one in which every character smokes and speaks in overly dramatic tones. I should have known it would be like this; it's based on a novel by James Ellroy, the same man who wrote the equally stylized ""L.A. Confidential."" But the fact that ""The Black Dahlia"" is commercially misrepresented doesn't make it bad. Quite the opposite; it's incredibly well made--so stylish and engaging that it refuses to let the audience off easy.

The story is a carefully crafted mystery, mixing a real event with fictional characters and circumstances. This real event is the murder of Elizabeth Short, a young aspiring actress (played in the film by Mia Kirshner). Her body was found in the vacant lot of a Los Angeles neighborhood in January of 1947. Not only was her mouth sliced open from ear to ear (making her look like an insane clown), her body was also severed in two at the waist. On top of all that, her blood was drained and a couple of her vital organs were removed. Such a disturbing crime has remained unsolved to this day, a fact that made the film's story that much more interesting. This is in spite of the fact that the actual murder is just one piece of the puzzle. Again, the ads sell this movie short; the Elizabeth Short case is not the sole focus of the plot, despite being prominently alluded to. The truth is that many mysteries are interwoven.

I suppose this may not suit those of you expecting a purely factual experience. It won't much help that the story is maddeningly complicated, pretty much to the point of utter confusion. It's not the kind of film you can passively experience. It demands your full attention right from the get go, with one crucial point after another piling up until it becomes a massive heap. This is problematic for me, a humble viewer; describing the plot will be very difficult, not only because it's loaded with details and twists that I can't give away, but also because I'm not sure I caught every detail and twist.

It begins with a voiceover narration, specifically that of Officer Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett). Already the tone of the film is set; specific shots are encased in shadow and smoke, and the music is heavy with smooth saxophone solos. In terms of dialogue, his pacing is as deliberate and colloquial as that of a classic private eye detective (I half expected to hear him say, ""That's when five-feet, seven-inches of trouble walked in""). When not on duty, he spends his spare time as a boxer, as does Sergeant Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). While the two are fierce competitors in the ring, their everyday relationship hints at a close friendship. At least, it's close enough for Lee to trust Bucky around Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), a former prostitute who's now Lee's girlfriend. Eventually, Bucky begins to suspect that he does have feelings for her.

The two cops initially focus on the impending release of Bobby DeWitt (Richard Brake), Kay's severely abusive ex-pimp (look for his initials on her backside). As the film progresses, the audience will come to understand that DeWitt is but one of the many contributors to a tangled web of circumstances, all of which interconnect in some form or another. What makes the situation even more complicated is that many--if not all--of the characters are duplicitous, some more than others. As the film winds up, many of these characters are exposed during a replay of key scenes. Here's an example: there's an early scene of a shootout, one that initially seems straightforward. While I can't get too specific about it, I will say that it's replayed at the end, and at that point, some of the most important figures are shown in a different light.

Everything comes to a head when Elizabeth Short's body is discovered. Lee and Bucky are assigned to the case despite their concern over both Kay and the release of the dastardly Bobby DeWitt. It ultimately proves too much for Lee, who's obsessive need to bring Elizabeth's killer(s) to justice is all-consuming. He stares at her photos with horrifying intensity, as if he believes doing so will actually point to a solution. Not only does this put extra strain on Kay, it also puts extra strain on Bucky; he now has to continue the case alone, and with little to go on. Questioning a handful of other aspiring actresses is all he initially has.

But after a while, his investigating yields to some possible leads. For one, he discovers Elizabeth's screen test-footage as well as her underground nudie film (both of which are effectively uncomfortable to watch). But more importantly, he discovers a high-class lesbian nightclub. Here enters Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), an edgy Hollywood socialite who once had a pretty intimate encounter with Elizabeth Short (heightened by the fact that one looks very similar to the other). Linscott is portrayed as a sultry femme fatale caricature: over the top, yet completely appropriate, especially since the character has more than a couple of skeletons in her closet (as does everyone else in this film).

She predictably gets close with Bucky as he attempts to extract information. He eventually meets the rest of her family during an interestingly choreographed dinner scene. Her father, Emmet (John Kavanagh), is a wealthy construction tycoon. Her teenage sister, Martha (Rachel Miner), enjoys drawing (and wait until you see what she makes for Bucky). Her mother, Ramona (Fiona Shaw) is perpetually loaded with medication and alcohol, so much so that every word out of her mouth is a slurred rambling. It's this character in particular that adds an unexpected dimension to the film. At first, the audience sees her as mere comedy relief. But as the crucial details gradually reveal themselves, her role veers further and further away from humorous. It gets worse when some shocking family secrets are brought to light.

How does this all connect with Lee? With Bucky? With Kay? With Elizabeth Short? I'm still asking myself these questions, despite the fact that a solution is given. With so many subplots, it's easy to understand why ""The Black Dahlia"" is difficult to fully absorb. But a film of such style and precision has to be given credit; it's a fascinating story that delves into the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the human mind. All the while, it maintains the best elements of Film Noir and paperback detective stories without unintentionally becoming a parody. I can't say whether or not this film in any way, shape, or form accurately reinterprets the facts of the Elizabeth Short murder, but to be perfectly honest, I don't really care. The story was made to stand on its own, much like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Amityville Horror,"" or ""An American Haunting"" (all of which are said to be inspired by ""true"" events). If all you historical purists out there find this unacceptable, then I'm sorry I wasted your time with this review.",1158278400,4,7376,4.848412698412698
1581570,1,B00005JP96,"First off, this movie does not concentrate on the Black Dahlia killing.  Instead, it presents the story of two cops that are sort of trying to solve the killing, but are instead distracted by everything else.  This is yet another crass Hollywood attempt to cash in on a name.  The book ""Black Dahlia Avenger"" has been a bestseller for some time now, but this movie comes nowhere close to what the book is.",1158278400,3,405,4.52054794520548
1581571,1,B00005JP96,"I love this type of movie and I've seen them all, from the greats, like Out Of The Past to bombs like Mullholland Falls.  But this, this, is really something.  Slow, convoluted, miscast, dull and completely lacking in suspense.  It doesn't even have that much to do with Elizabeth Short.

Except for Aaron Eckhart all the major characters look like kids who got into mom and dad's closet, trying to ape the style of the great 1940s actors.  None are convincing.  Aaron Eckhart is (surprisingly) even worse.

The story is terribly convoluted and as if to make up for it, just when you think its over, there is an attempt to tie things up (pun possibly intended).  But this really isn't necessary for a case that was never solved.

There are a few bright spots.  You get to see the inside of one of the Kessling houses in Silverlake (how they got their movie equipment on that street would make for a good supplement).  They also put together a beautiful diner set.  Mark Isham's score is the only other thing that doesn't come off as phony.

This type of film always makes me think of The Two Jakes.  I know everybody hates The Two Jakes because its complicated but it gets L.A. in the 40s just right, great dialog from Robert Towne and of course Nicholson who looks more like a crime investigator than a male model.

The book, by the way, is really something.  How Brian De Palma turned it into this, I can't imagine.",1158278400,6,1417,4.4765625

1581681,3,B00005JP96,"This is a  fictional account of the investigation into the infamous case of the Black Dahlia, the murder of Hollywood wanna-be Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner). The film opens introducing two police officers and former boxers Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert (Josh Hartnett). Lee lives with the flirty and high maintenance Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) well beyond his means unquestioned by his partner. They are assigned the case of Raymond ""Junior"" Nash, child rapist and murderer. When the Black Dahlia case comes up and becomes more high profile, Lee insists on taking it over and abandoning the Nash case...he is described as a ""political animal."" The investigation leads to the seedy underground of Hollywood films. This is where Bucky meets Hilary Swank who looks similar to the dead girl.

The film felt slow. The ""B"" dialogue had no zip as the actors gave us what could be borderline raspberry performances. There is a mystery aspect that is explained in the last few minutes.

This film was nominated for an Oscar ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"" and The Stinkers Bad Movie Awards in four categories

Couldn't be more cartoonish if the characters were played by Mickey, Minnie, and other Disney faves. Poor Hilary Swank; she gives it her all but it's not a character she plays, it's a caricature.

I have never seen such a riveting subject matter with the potential for such an interesting exploration be presented in such a boring way.  The movie is supposed to be in a semi film noir style but it translates as simply slow to the screen.  The story line is more about some strange love relationships and friendships than it is about the case itself and/or the woman on whom the movie is supposed to be based, Elizabeth Short.  I don't think I've seen a movie with such potential be done so poorly in a long time.

Fire and Ice, Lee and Dwight (Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett), LAPD detectives, boxers, lovers of the same woman... if that's not enough to pique your interest, well, maybe this film was for me and not you.

The acting is good.  One might say over top even at times.  The cadence of the film creeps along say the beginning but rapidly picks up steam.  The 1940s set makes this film work.  The period just begs for a film like this.  The highlight actor of the film comes from Fiona Shaw as Ramona Linscott.  This woman plays messed up as if she wasn't playing.

Do watch this film and enjoy the hell outta it.  You don't have to go back and watch it again if you don't want to.",1458432000,3,820,4.1528662420382165
1581876,5,B00005JP96,"This film greatly exemplifies what I have discovered many years ago, which is: films that most people find not to their liking are films that I find great. I should have seen this film when it first came out...but I remember reading so many reviews saying how terrible it was, afterwards I totally forgot about it until I saw it recently on television.  Black Dahlia (2006) is a film based on the unsolved murder case of Elisabeth Short.  In January of 1947 a body of young woman was discovered in a Los Angeles park.  The body was heavily mutilated and it sparked an outraged in the public.  The perpetrator(s) was never found.  In 1987, James Ellroy published a neo-noir book by the title The Black Dahlia which was also inspired by the murder of Elisabeth Short.

In the film directed by the great Brian de Palma we have two cops: Dwight and Lee (played respectful by Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart) who are LA cops, boxers, rivals, and partners trying to solve the murder case of Elisabeth Short, named by the press as the Black Dahlia.  The story also includes a promiscuous girlfriend of Lee (played by Scarlett Johansson), and a powerful Hollywood construction magnate with his ""colorful"" family members. If you liked any of the movies such as: Big Sleep (1946), Chinatown (1974), Two Jakes (1990), L.A. Confidential (1997), Gangster Squad (2013)--- Black Dahlia has similar atmosphere as any of these named above films, which is the 1940's noir mystery, drama, crime --type.",1453852800,2,1483,4.81496062992126

The production design team certainly deserved an Oscar nod, as well. I understand director De Palma generated a three-hour cut that was trimmed down to under two hours (probably by studio suits), which would explain the rather disjointed storytelling. Every cast member has their moments but on the whole this is not the film they will be remembered for. Aaron Eckhart's high energy, self-involved character is a bit much at times, but one cannot argue he is not committed to his character's ego! Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia in the HARRY POTTER movies) delivers a gloriously unhinged performance as Hilary Swank's heavily medicated mother. Most critics dismiss her performance as over the top but with a character as such there is no top and Miss Shaw hits all the right marks (note to critics: people like this really do exist).

Therefore, if one *really* doesn't want to have any of the large twists ruined, it might be best not to continue.

After all of the terrible reviews I've read of this movie here and elsewhere, I came into this with extremely low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. I had almost literally *just* finished reading the book this movie was based on, however, and I have some thoughts on this point.

First of all, it's important to note the fact that it's fairly obvious a large portion of the negative reviewers have never read the book: the overwhelming majority of the criticism heaped upon this movie that doesn't have to do with the acting has to do with factors inherent to the original story and the adaptation thereof. Read a synopsis and reviews of the book, first; Ellroy admits to taking quite a few liberties with the facts of the actual case for the sake of...well, for the sake of his own catharsis about his mother, if you read his essay on the matter (which comes as the new afterword to recent editions of the book). So, no, if you're looking for a 100% factual accounting of the Elizabeth Short murder case and investigation, you're not going to find it here. And people who read a lot of mystery/thriller novels of this length (as opposed to the older and much shorter 200-ish page novels by the likes of Hammett, Chandler, et al.) will know how dicey it can be to adapt a dense, story-driven 300+ page novel into a movie of under 3 hours. Depending on the precise source material, this task can range from difficult to impossible. With Ellroy's narrative focus bouncing around from topic to topic like an easily-distracted kitten (in some cases, he doesn't even stay on a single line of investigation within the *same page*), multiple distinct climaxes followed by points where the book could have ended logically, and a tremendous number of dead-ends that don't end up having any bearing on the case, this book clearly edged towards the ""impossible"" end of that spectrum: the original cut of this film was over 3 hours, and De Palma had to edit an hour of it out, which is a primary reason for many of the film's pacing and storyline issues. I suspect it still would have felt harried even with the extra hour, given how much of the novel they had to leave out. (I suppose I should add that I'm not necessarily a particular fan of Brian De Palma, so I'm not just some loyal apologist.)

Second, for those who have actually read the book, I pose *the* important (and largely ignored in the other reviews) question: was this movie a good adaptation of the book? I would have to say yes, very much so. It's undeniable that, due to the immense scope and density of the book (which included multiple-chapter trips to Boston, New Jersey, Tijuana and Ensenada that were all dropped for the film), entire plot threads; subplots; and even major characters had to be dropped for time, and several major and important story elements (Bucky Bleichert's fall from grace, Lee Blanchard's death, the extent of Lee's corruption and Kay Lake's involvement therein, the Sprague/Linscott family's ultimate fates) had to be altered to accommodate these changes. But they were tweaked in ways that still work well in the overall context and story of the film. Ellroy spends an inordinate amount of time and ink on the Fire & Ice duo's infatuation/fixation on Elizabeth ""Betty"" Short/The Dahlia - though De Palma eschews the Bleichert narration from the book which literally states as much, it manages to come through quite nicely in a very subtle way with the sequences of Bucky viewing Betty's screen tests. One thing I often use as a barometer for how well a movie adapts a book is how much dialog from the book makes it through to the film unaltered, and many of the important scenes jumped out at me in this regard (it's tough to forget the phrase ""tighter than a crab's ass"" once you've heard it).

The production design, one of the most important things for a period piece in our increasingly superficial film culture, was astonishingly immersive and well-done - I stop just short of saying *completely* ""authentic,"" however, because the large part of me that's obsessed with 1930s/40s imagery (as a card-carrying member of the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles) can pick apart a few anachronisms, inaccuracies, and (most commonly) improbabilities within the setting and design. Still, it's all quite beautifully-done, and - to the casual, non-pedant observer - quite period-accurate. Most importantly, it also met my expectations as to what the set pieces would have looked like as I was reading the book. The musical score is alarmingly similar to Goldsmith's for ""LA Confidential"" - a good thing insofar as it was appropriate to the story and aesthetics, even if lacking in originality.

Ultimately, what hurts this film most are all the things that people have already pointed out: story flaws, mediocre acting, its pacing and ponderous length. I've already addressed the writing- and editing-related issues, insofar as they're largely inherent to and inherited from the source novel. I didn't find the acting to be any great ""nails on a chalkboard""-type stumbling block, but I would agree none of the main players deserved particular recognition. I was rather impressed with Mia Kirshner's ""screen test"" performances as Betty Short, however. Through these, and her, we see the character Ellroy intended to portray: the inept actress and tragic figure. Some have said that this film can't decide whether to embrace or parody the film noir tropes and cliches, but I didn't notice this to any great extent. Indeed, the movie actually tones down several of the most egregious introspective examples of this from Ellroy's novel (the aforementioned example of Bucky viewing Betty's screen tests standing in for his outright obsession with her in so many words of narration, the omission of numerous examples of his lusting for Short after-the-fact).

Still, as an adaptation of the novel, I don't find enough of these things here for me to consider this film anything besides what it is: a just ""good"" adaptation of an excellent, albeit flawed, novel. Overall, I don't really know what, if anything (or how much), could have been done to improve upon this, given the source material. It's the sort of thing that really would have stood best as a mini-series - each of the novel's four ""sections"" as an hour-long episode - allowing writer, director, and designer to really spread their wings without having to edit out or alter too much of the original novel.

I recommend this movie to people who enjoyed the book, albeit with the caveat that it helps one's ability to follow it if the book is still quite fresh in one's mind. I would cautiously recommend it to people fond of noir fiction (particularly neo-noir films) and 1940s aestetics, but not strongly, for all of the aforementioned reasons.",1421798400,8,7264,4.824237560192616

  The movie is well made and acted.  And is one of the finer examples of modern Film Noir.  But on the same token, it brought in to much of the ""Hollywoodization"" & not enough fact on the actual tragic murder of Elizabeth Short.

1582201,2,B00005JP96,"I've tried to watch this film at least twice -- it was on ""free"" TV both times, so no harm no foul, outside of time lost -- and it is nearly as horrifying as the original crime.  In all the wrong ways.

I live within a half mile of where Elizabeth Short, aka ""The Black Dahlia,"" once lived, and that reminded me that I should finally write a review for this film.  Taking a peek at the average rating of Amazonians, it does appear that this film has been universally panned, which is appropriate.

The acting is pretty terrible, but to be fair, that is not surprising since Josh Hartnett is the ""star"" here.  I've always steered clear of his films, and I should have followed that rule with this film.  But this film does have an excellent supporting cast.  In particular, I'm a fan of Aaron Eckhart -- check out ""Thank You For Smoking"" as that is one of his best films -- and Hillary Swank deservedly holds two Oscars.  And I won't be surprised when she eventually wins another.  Even Scarlett Johannson has her moments, as I really liked her in ""We Bought a Zoo"" as well as a Woody Allen film or two.  I do believe that many of the actors here, even though most are solid professionals, just mailed it in halfway.  Hey, wouldn't you have done the same?

But I believe that this film's biggest problem went all the way back to the screenplay.  It seems horribly disjointed, and at times, if you didn't know the title of the film, you may have no idea what it's even about.  I don't believe that this film answers any unanswered questions, and there are quite a few.  I believe that a very good film about this subject could be made, assuming someone has a reasonable theory about the murder and pushes that theory in a coherent way.  After all, the murder has never been solved, and I've seen a couple of theories on some documentaries, theories that were probably as ridiculous as this film.  (From memory, I believe that John Douglas discusses this case in one of his books, and I believe that he has the best theory that I've read.)

I'm going to next try ""Ulli Lommel's Black Dahlia,"" even though that film has even weaker reviews.  Why?  Well, it's ""free"" on Amazon streaming, if you have Prime, and I do.  So I can just turn it off mid-stream if necessary when it goes south, which more than likely will right after the initial credits.

And it's too bad that Ms. Short ""went south"" herself, after her father kicked her out of the house for staying out too late.  But she was just trying to become a star, and that effort was cut terribly short.",1389398400,,2552,4.394456289978678
1582202,3,B00005JP96,"This movie is Hollywood speculation and centers around the personal lives of two detectives that are working the case.  The movie is still worth watching, but don't expect too much factual information about the actual Black Dahlia murder.",1383609600,,238,5.2631578947368425
1582203,5,B00005JP96,I was upset to see how many people had a strong dislike for this film. I found it to be a favorite in my collection. Perhaps some of the other viewers weren't expecting a movie more about the cops than the crime itself.,1376438400,2,219,4.116279069767442
1582204,3,B00005JP96,"Brian De Palma had an orginal cut of three hours to this movie. James Ellroy had seen the original three hour cut and it was a masterpiece according to Ellroy. Ellroy has refused to comment on the butchered theatrical version! The studio then took out 40 minutes from the movie and cut it down to 115 minutes. The brief scenes with the gangsters in the film seemed like there were scenes deleted and left on the cutting room floor.

This film has probably the most complicated narrative structure De Palma has worked with and requires multiple viewings. Scenes are shot from different perspective reminiscent from films such as SNAKE EYES and MURDER A LA MOD. De Palma has created a classic film-noir mood throughout and one can see why cinematographer Vilmos Zigmond got an Oscar nomination. Some of the performances may not seem pitch-perfect but the film has good set-pieces from the early shoot-out where the dahlia is found dead behind the establishment where Mr Ice and Mr Fire have a shoot-out with black gangsters. The other set-piece which is a standout is when Aarron Eckhart is stylishly assassinated as that is a beautifully put together sequence by De Palma. From there on the film becomes more visually complicated from different POV's as the extended cut would have made more clarity in it's explanation of the Dahlia's murder.

De Palma can be heard on the soundtrack as the test director on the test screening films as he gives acting instructions to the Dahlia which De Palma also did in MURDER A LA MOD.

This film seems to have been a total accident waiting to happen from the get-go. The script is actually not all that bad, but this movie is just off the wall and all over the place. Even oscar winner Hillary Swank is simply terrible in her role. The film goes from serious murder mystery to almost crackpot comedy from one scene to the next. To think this is the man who made some great films like The Untouchables, Scarface, Casualties of war, Carlitos way, Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Blow out, Carrie, Obsession, The Fury, and Sisters. All pretty good to great movies. Some of them considered classics. But here De Palma really screwed up. Hes had a few flops here and there before, but this is an all time low for a director who has always been inventive and sometimes even monumental in his work.

The movie is ok. Josh Harnett leaves a lot to be desired, and to be honest, I felt he was just wrong for this whole movie. Part way through the movie, everything he said just sounded dumb. Kind of like in ""Team America"" when Matt Damon came about and just said ""M-attt DA-mUn.""

I really think I became so irritated because the movie became more focused on the crap drama of Harnett's life than the actual Black Dahlia case. HELLO. If you are going to call a movie ""BLACK DAHLIA"" you might want to make the movie about the topic. Like I stated above, there are so many theories and such out there, they could have made this movie a lot more interesting than what it was. I will admit, I did like who they blamed everything on, and how it came about. It was pretty twisted. But by that point, the movie was essentially ruined.

There is a lot more I can say about this movie, but I won't. Basically, if you are bored and are interested in ""The Black Dahlia,"" you will probably find some parts of it interesting anyway.

Predictably, this movie has all the typical trappings of most of De Palma's films - overly long, stilted dialogue, gratuitous and self-indulgent camera shots, and of course, some graphic violence thrown in for good measure. I can't imagine what Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank were thinking when they took on this project, but from the way they come across on screen, it seems obvious they didn't believe in the characters they portrayed. The acting seems unnatural and over-rehearsed, and the dialogue bizarre and campy, which would seem to completely undermine the filmmaker's intent of paying tribute to the Film Noir genre. Nothing seems natural in this mess of a movie with its overly complex plot and characters that make no sense. Even the age-old cliche of pushing everything off the kitchen table so that wild and passionate lovemaking can ensue completely falls flat because of the excruciating non-chemistry between Hartnett and Johansson, and when they finally do get around to kissing and ""doing it"" on the kitchen table, the whole thing just seems so staged and ridiculous. The most impressive thing about this film is the amazing cast - from big stars to character actors, whose talents are shamefully wasted in this pointless crapfest. For me, the best part of the movie was seeing Ian McNeice in a bit part as the coroner (if you are a fan of the BBC series Doc Martin, you'll remember most recently he played the bumbling but lovable Bert Large).

1582285,2,B00005JP96,"If you are looking for a movie about the murder mystery of Black Dahlia that fascinated the nation since 1947, then this not the movie you are looking for. Numerous television shows have been produced that document the murder in greater detail than this movie purports to do. The producers of this movie undertook this project with a great confidence that this will succeed in the same way as the movie ""LA Confidential,"" which is based on the James Ellroy novel, but their calculations were erroneous. James Ellroy also wrote this novel about Black dahlia case but not so much about the murder per se, but about the cops of LAPD; the divisiveness, corruption, and coercion. The movie has plenty of sexual perversion, tramps, lesbian cocktail lounges of 1940s Los Angeles, and m&eacute;nage a trios, violence and crime not directly related to the Black Dahlia case. Many of historical facts surrounding Elizabeth Short and her father were wrong.  Her father lived near San Francisco not LA.

You don't hear about Black Dahlia murder until about 20-25 minutes into the movie and the main thing you learn about the murder victim is that she slept around with almost any man or a woman for a cigarette and sandwich. Unfortunately this is not what is said about the unfortunate victim, Elizabeth Short in many investigative television shows.

Scarlet Johansson and Hilary Swank are two of the finest performers of Hollywood but unfortunately their talents are not used appropriately. Poor Johansson is subjected to a strange and sometimes humiliating m&eacute;nage a trios with her boy friend Aaron Eckhart (as 'Mr. Fire') and his pal Josh Hartnett (as 'Mr. Ice'). Did it make any difference to the movie if this relationship didn't exist? I can't help but compare this movie with ""LA Confidential."" I think the performance of Josh Harnett as a tough cop of LAPD is far superior to the performance of Russell Crowe.

The script is confusing (is it a flashback or not?), there are all kinds of side stories, and it's only at the end that the director and writer suddenly remember that they are supposed to be making a film based on a real killing, and hurriedly come up with as contrived an ending as one might ever see.",1361836800,,699,4.46875

I wish we had more of these films.  To be truthful, the most disappointing aspect of this film is that practically none of it was shot in Los Angeles.  They shot the film in Bulgaria if you can believe it.  That kind of ruins the atmosphere.  I half expected some east European gypsies pulling a horse cart to walk through one of the scenes. So if you are looking to find the truth behind the Dahlia mystery or a real understandable film nior cop movie, this is not for you.  But if you want a campy visit back to the late forties in LA, you may get a kick out of it.",1357344000,,1190,3.9746835443037973

As usual De Palma makes a pastiche of mimicking his betters and the result is a boring, incoherent mess. That's two hours I won't get back. Don't make the same mistake I did.",1356912000,2,402,4.36

1582331,4,B00005JP96,"This picture was based on a novel of the same title by James Ellroy (who is probably best known for writing ""L.A. Confidential), who was likely inspired by the real life 1947 ""Black Dahlia"" murder. This film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 79th Academy Awards, but lost to Pan's Labyrinth.

It got a bad rap but is a better film than indicated though I will warn that some casual moviegoers will have a hard time following it.

The movie follows two ex boxer buddy cops (Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart) who both ""love"" the same woman (played by Scarlet Johansen). Said woman has a dark past and is married to the character played by Eckhart. You can imagine one of the paths that will manifest in this love triangle but I leave it to your imagination.

There is a true visual brilliance in this picture. Perhaps too much that the story gets put in the background at times. As there were complaints that this tale is convoluted one has to remember that this is a mystery with clue trails and red herrings are going to be obvious yet perhaps unsatisfying to some viewers. Perhaps one of the problems is that by the time the mystery is solved it doesn't feel ""big"" enough or emotionally moving enough to have a satisfying ending?

Still worth a look but this isn't as good as L.A. Confidential.

In addition to names already mentioned this also stars Hillary Swank and Mike Starr.

1582332,3,B00005JP96,"When we went to see this movie in the theaters, I - like most unsuspected saps - believed from the marketing that this was a story about an unsolved true crime that I had not heard of previously.  When the lights came up in the theater, I delivered an expletive-laden critique that essentially boiled down to, ""I did not understand this movie at all...""  My husband and brother agreed.

Flash forward to a vacation where a rereleased James Ellroy ""The Black Dahlia"" FICTIONAL novel was for sale in a drugstore.  I bought it for a beach read, still liking the essential idea of this true crime, and hoping I would understand the the film.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!!  This is the key!  It's a WONDERFUL ""noir"" novel, with taut writing and excellent pacing.  And - more to the point - I understood the entire movie after reading the novel.  De Palma and his screenwriter(s?) did a brilliant job recapturing the essential plot threads, with a few exceptions that I will name in a moment.  However, from the opening montages through to the surreal underground communities and families in this burgeoning Hollywood chaos, almost all of the scenes in the movie are faithfully recalling the main elements of the novel.

That said - there are issues.  The novel is obviously denser than a film could be, and so De Palma (who by all accounts was forced to cut an hour of footage from his final cut) is forced to rely on quick impressions to try to explain everything that is happening.  Perhaps some of the side plots could have been eliminated, as they seem completely unconnected to the main plot (even when they are critical to the book).  The ending of the book and the ending of the movie are also different.  I can usually accept that when there is an adaptation of a novel; sacrifices have to be made for time and comprehension.  However, De Palma's ending is SO confusing, and had no real foreshadowing or even adequate explanation, and so the whole ending scene seems contrived and ludicrous...

And that's my final comment: the acting is insanely bad.  I've now seen the movie many times, and each time I appreciate the cinematography more and the acting less and less.  Two standouts in an otherwise disastrous cast are Aaron Eckhart and Mia Kirchner...the rest of them are all worthless.

Anyway, as a reader and a lover of mystery, true crime, and thrillers, I urge people to READ THE BOOK and then WATCH THE FILM...there are so many more aspects to appreciate in the movie once the audience is familiar with the Ellroy book.",1345593600,,2526,4.671945701357466

1582334,5,B00005JP96,"Wow, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like a jerk here, but some people obviously don't know anything about the nuances of acting that comes with true period pieces. Plus, this movie was so much more than just the ""acting"". Like any other good film noir, this had so many different elements going on on so many different levels, that it's really only fair to view it at least twice before forming an opinion of it. For there are so many things to catch and pick up on that might be able to be caught during the first viewing.

In my opinion, this is possibly the best film noir since Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"". It's dark and moody, and the constant themes of corruption and lost dreams that echo throughout are something to treasure this film for.
If you want a Hollywood driven film that concentrates on ""acting"", stick to some garbage like ""L.A. Confidential"", or worse ""Hollywoodland"", something so generic and pedestrian, and highly overrated it isn't funny. But if you want to enjoy a true film noir, and an awesome period piece, this is the film to check out.

This movie kind of ruined me against a lot of other period pieces recently made, like the other Ellroy adaption, ""L.A. Confidential"". While that is a good movie, it just isn't a good period piece, because all the dialogue (and delivery of dialogue) could belong to today's contemporary dialect. However, I think that is why so many hate on ""The Black Dahlia"", because it refused to do that, and stayed true to the dialect of the period it represents.

It is a sad state that most of today's movie viewing audience is so dumbed down and desensitized, and practically brainwashed into thinking that everything must either look like an MTV video or a really bad video game to be considered good anymore. Give me a good old fashioned movie like this that relies on good story telling to get its message across any day over lots of the crap that gets made these days.

So sad to see that so many didn't enjoy it. I know I sure did! Matter of fact, I stil consider this to be the best film to be made in not only 2006, but this entire decade. Highly recommended!

1582336,1,B00005JP96,"Beany, my beloved friend, is going to hate me for this.

`The Black Dahlia' fuses a lot of things I really love about the movies.  First, you have the film noir.  This is a genre that is VERY hard to get right, especially in this generation.  All too often directors want to be super literal when attempting this fare and it becomes a technically proficient but emotionally stunted work.  The era thing is a deterrent because the 30's and 40's were so rich with this coolness that aided in fleshing out rather stagnant approaches to filmmaking.  That is hard to come by today because the approach to acting is so different.  When you take actors used to heavy emoting and make them scale backwards they lose the cool and come across dull and empty.  But, there have been successful takes on the genre, even in recent years.  Second, you have James Ellroy, who has written some of the best crime novels ever and when you factor in the adaptation of `L.A. Confidential' (a beautiful harmony of modern flare and nostalgic noir techniques over a canvas of brilliant performances) I was really excited to see this unfold.  Then you have Brian de Palma.  I'm not the biggest fan, but fear is an ally of his and he has worked some magic in creating tense situations that simmer just right; and this premise was in dire need of a hand adept at creating the right mood.  Fourth, and not least, is the Scarlett Johansson effect.  I'm drawn to her, not just because she is gorgeous but because her actorly antics are alluring in themselves.

So I had four very promising reasons to see this film.  Sadly, none of them worked; like, at all.

First, I'll start with the obvious.  Like many a critic has noted, Scarlett Johansson probably puts in her worst performance to date here.  She is atrociously out of her comfort zone and while she tries really, really hard, it is embarrassing to note how poorly she attempts to emote so quietly.  UGH, this is coming from the same girl who should have won an Oscar for subtle emoting in `Lost in Translation' and yet she was so caught up in trying to find the style in this genre that she fell on her face; hard.  That leads me to the rest of the cast, who were uniformly terrible (aside from Mia Kirshner and Fiona Shaw).  Hartnett is an actor I often defend because I like him, but by god was he boring as all get out here.  Eckhart had some nice moments but he flew so far over the top in scenes it was hard to take him seriously. And don't even get me started on Hilary Swank.  The idea that she looks like Kirshner was hard enough to swallow (let alone the fact that she was trying so hard to skew young and yet she has old man hands that are mugging up the whole screen) but she just couldn't get the seductive angle right to save her life.  Why didn't they get Jennifer Connelly for this part?  The whole movie I was thinking ""that dead actress looks just like Jennifer Connelly"".  I never once said ""wow, she and Swank could be sisters"".  That brings me to the script.  As some have already mentioned, this veers to far from the initial murder storyline and becomes a soap opera of sorts (and uninteresting one at that, since the actors are so disgustingly inept at being remotely convincing), which takes away from the feel of a James Ellroy novel.

True, there is some mood here, but it is ultimately sacrificed by the poor handling of the script and the terrible work with these actors, which I do blame de Palma for.  I mean, a director needs to work with his cast to find a niche, and de Palma basically left these fish out of water to muddle through this nightmare all on their own.  When I said earlier about this genre being taken too literally, yeah, that happened here and to devastating effect.

I wanted to love this Beany, I really did, but the best I can say is that the film was pretty, the costumes were authentic and the makeup department went all out with that corpse (truly terrifying).  I can't even praise the score, which was so clichd and uninspired I was rolling my eyes during the predictable rise and fall.

Oh, but Kirshner was sincerely nave and Shaw was deliciously demented; so there is that.",1329782400,2,4160,4.444591029023747

1582398,3,B00005JP96,"So, I have been reading up on the Black Dahlia... I'm 23 years old and until a few weeks ago, I had never heard of what had happened to Elizabeth Short. I've been watching all of the documentaries and reading a lot of the literature. I just read ""The Black Dahlia"" (the book written by James Ellroy) and I have to say, that the book is wonderful, but it wasn't the right version of the Elizabeth Short Theory to be translated into a film. And also... the Black Dahlia is more of a back drop to the story as opposed to the MAIN STORY. It would be like Christopher Nolan making a Batman Movie... and focusing a majority of the film about ALFRED.

Aside from the story not being upto par with the information about the Black Dahlia... with what they did with the movie... THEY HIT THE MARK. Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckert both gave some of their BEST PERFORMANCES in this film. The set design and photography were Academy Award Worthy (in fact despite the fact that this film was an F+ Failure, it was nominated for an Academy Award).

If you have no interest in the Black Dahlia Case and just like Time Period Films, then I would highly recommend this film... on the other hand if you know everything there is to know about Elizabeth Short and know that the only two plausible killer's are either ""George Hodel"" or ""Walter Bailey""... then you might wanna watch this for the cinematography.

I WILL SAY, that if it wasn't for the lack of authenticity... I would have given this film 5 stars NO QUESTIONS ASKED.",1325289600,2,1507,4.433212996389892

To top it off, I don't know what Hollywood sees in Hilary Swank at all. First of all, are they all blind. This is not a sexy attractive woman and yet she plays a femme fatale in this.

Throw in the whole Scarlett Johansson, Josh Harnett, Aaron Eckhart what is the deal with them? Are they living a polyamorous lifestyle? It's never fully revealed and I couldn't figure out if it was implied or what it had to do with anything. She's wasted in this role and she should have played the femme fatale character.

I have spent some time looking over the 1 and 2 star reviews of this Brian De Palma classic and I guess I think that like most of his films you either love it or hate it, and for this one most seem to hate it. Some of that comes from confusion as to whether De Palma was making a movie about the Elizabeth Short murder or adapting the James Ellroy novel. The special features on this edition make it clear it was the latter. Ellroy does an extensive interview explaining how the murder of his mother when he was 10 years and then the Elizabeth Short murder a year later impacted his life and his writing. Interviews with De Palma make it clear he was not trying to depict the murder (BTW, Google 'The Black Dahlia' or 'Elizabeth Short' and see that discussions of the murder after 60 years still go on) but had Ellroy's novel firmly in mind as did the screen writer Josh Friedman.

Parts of the movie actually don't work for me; the ending for example is hard to believe, but it does connect all the dots. But I'm giving the Blu Ray edition 5 stars because the transfer is great. De Palma explains he shot the first part of the movie in a different style than the rest for specific reasons and I've seen at least one review that thought that was a transfer error. The special features are alright but not spectacular but answered all my questions. It has all the usual Blu Ray 'bells and whistles' if you are into that sort of thing.

The story is convoluted and the storytelling is awkward.  I can explain the film's core storylines, but to tie everything together is a task beyond me.  There is one person involved who deserves praise: Mia Kirshner, who portrays the thin, secondary character of Elizabeth Short with surprising emotional depth.

1582407,1,B00005JP96,"The worst part of this movie for me, besides that it was boring & stilted, was just how off base the real events of Elizabeth Short's life, death and murder investigation were portrayed. It capitalized on the victim, poor Elizabeth Short and really wasn't about her much at all. What infuriated me even more was how it flashed to her desecrated body with a black crow cawing just using her murder scene as a cheap scare - it wasn't part of the story line... it's like the director just thought, ""Now where can I stick in this cheesy replica of Elizabeth Short's mutilated body to terrify the heck out of everybody?"" He uses the crime scene as a sudden flashback... I jumped at it.. and ended up angry at the movie makers. And I didn't appreciate the gory scene where a knife is shown cutting slowly Elizabeth's mouth with blood pouring out. I almost threw up - I found that obscene... some things are just too graphic. Awful... just awful.

I've lost a lot of respect for de Palma's good judgment.

 I know they claim it's just fiction, but I don't like stories that take real events and make up a lot of false stories about what happened especially using real people and claiming they did things they didn't actually do in their lives. Fictional characters can do fictional actions, but the real people should never do something they didn't really do. It confuses the truth and creates false legends. Example: Elizabeth Short did not make a lesbian porn movie. Her roommates and boyfriends specifically stated she was not ""into women"".

This movie went beyond historical fiction into fantasy land and was disrespectful of the real ""Black Dahlia"". I got a headache watching it.

It became traumatic for me because I had met one of the apparent suspects & couldn't discuss it when the police questioned me because it involved a personal friend.

1582440,5,B00005JP96,"I cannot believe all of the negative reviews on this film. And I have no idea why people would rather see the generic ""Hollywoodland"" and give it such praise, liken to throwing roses at it, but they are heaving meat cleavers at this ingenious intellectual intelligent psychological mystery thriller. And, both films are fictional stories set in the 40's and 50's about factual accounts.

People want to complain about how bad the dialogue is in ""The Black Dahlia"", not realizing how REALISTIC it is for the time period, but they hail ""Hollywoodland"" as a masterpiece of cinema, when its dialogue IS atrocious, and so fake for the period it's supposed to be representing. Such a generic film! But, that's, unfortunately, what people want in this day and age of fast food, video game living. They don't wanna have to think, my God, that would just be too hard on them, especially when they can laugh at ""Dumb and Dumber"" wasting every brain cell they have, but not having to question what they are seeing. To me, that's very scary, for I believe people should question EVERYTHING they see, be it a film, a tv show, or (especially) the news.

Brian De Palma doesn't make films for critics or idiots, so that's why so many people are attacking him, because they're IDIOTS!! Don't get me wrong, I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some of the reasons I've read for not liking this film are just retarded (no offense)! Saying that it hardly deals with the Dahlia, saying the acting and/or dialogue is atrocious, and calling De Palma a hack?!? This is NOT supposed to be a true account of the black dahlia, but a FICTIONAL one!

This film is based on James Ellroy's 1987 noir novel, which was a FICTIONAL account of the crime infused with a lot of other stuff, heavily inspired by the murder of Betty Short and Ellroy's mother. Watch the bonus features on the disc and you will see Ellroy discussing in great detail what I am talking about. Plus, you will see him say how much he LOVES the film based on his novel (I seem to remember a lot of people saying somewhere that he hated the film?).

On the De Palma A La Mod website, De Palma gives a very insightful interview regarding this film, and its marketing/distribution problems. He even said that it was a mistake to sell it as ""based on a true story"". That was not his move, but the studio's decision. I am only somewhat familiar with the real life story of Betty Short, but I feel this film did a good job capturing the tragedy of her life (and subsequent death). I would like to see a film made about the real Betty Short some day, but in the meantime I wish people would quit bashing on this film for not being it and enjoy it for what it is, a true fictional film noir classic in the vein of ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"".

Every frame of this film is dripped in such beautiful film noir, that it makes the viewer feel as if they are in the 40's, or at least watching a film from that era. And, the reason for the 'over-the-top' acting, as it's been written, is for the same reason, to capture what is was REALLY like in L.A. in the 1940's.

And, it's not 40, but only 20 minutes into the film that the body of the Dahlia is discovered. And, as for the reason of doing it the way it was done, showing it as a back drop, was showing that there was ALWAYS something corrupt and/or evil lurking in the background, and/or underneath the surface. (That last part is for a reviewer that complained that there was even an 'earthquake' sequence. Hello! There are earthquakes in L.A. everyday!) Plus, the earthquake was used to distract from Blanchard seeing Madeline Linscott's name inside the matchbook Bucky had tossed him, a scene that proves crucial in a later flash back. And, as for the dialogue, well, this is how people talked in the 40's; especially in the movies.

And, of coarse, there's the complaint about Aaron Eckhart overacting...well, didn't ANYONE hear that he was hyped up on benzadrine (the character, not the actor), which would have that effect? And, it's ALL about the Dahlia once her body is discovered, unlike some idiotic reviews would have you believe, just not in the way that falls under 'conventional'.

It's about how the 2 cops become obsessed with the Dahlia and solving the case, putting other cases aside, like Raymond ""Junior"" Nash, a child molester and murderer, and Bobby Dewitt (whose initials are cut into Kay's back, B.D. -maybe a visual reference to Brian De Palma?) a lowlife bank robber and pimp that Blanchard had put away, but will soon be getting released, and Blanchard can't risk Dewitt being on the loose. In the meantime, Bucky becomes obsessed with Madeline Linscott, a Dahlia-type wanna be, femme fatale. (One of the many great lines in the movie come from her: ""Oh, what's your name?"" she asks Bucky. ""Bucky,"" he replies. ""Bucky? I'll try to remember,"" she responds in a terrific salute to Hepburn and Bacall. It's all in the facial expression as she speaks, full of sarcasm.)

(And, no, Hillary Swank's Madeline Linnscott doesn't look like Betty Short! But that is the whole point! It is a great allusion to how obsession can make someone see resemblance in even the furthest possible object. When someone is obsessed, it is usually only ""image"" that is seen anyway, so when Bucky notices the strong resemblance in image between Madeline and Betty, in his mind the two women look just alike.)

And, that goes for the rest of the cast. Everyone in this film is dynamite, whether it be in some of the lead roles by Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart, Scarlett Johansson, Hillary Swank, or Mia Kirschner; or some of the minor roles played by Kevin Dunn, Gregg Henry, and (last but NOT least) the always great William Finley. And as for the criticism of Fiona Shaw, well, shame on you all, for she brings down the house with her BRILLIANT performance of Ramona Linscott!! Her performance is equal to that of Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" and Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard"". Kudos to you Fiona for that awesome homage!

Then there's the brilliant way the 'screen test' films are shot and incorporated into the film to serve as both character and plot development is reason enough to praise this film AND De Palma! And, it was TOO cool that Brian dubbed his own voice as the director of the 'screen test' films! (Where is a Pauline Kael in this day and age, because we really need one?!)

This is a solid homerun for De Palma, and an obvious 'postcard' to all of his fans. This is an explosive descent into Hell, as described by the director, not some 'lightweight' ""L.A. Confidential"". And, the gore is very minimal (surprising since it's such a sinister story), unlike an idiotic grossout episode of ""CSI"", or ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"", which is probably what a lot of reviewers on here were expecting.

And, as for the mystery within a mystery within a mystery, kudos to you Brian for pulling off such a difficult, exciting project. This is the kind of movie that only true fans of GOOD, psychological, suspense, mystery thrillers can enjoy; people who like to think as they're watching the film, enjoy being challenged by all the twists and turns, and NOT have to have everything spelled out for them, like some lowrate episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"". (You know, dumbed down and spelled out in a simplistic A,B,C's kind of way.) If you want to see a film that is mesmerising in every scene, and something that you'll want to view multiple times, then ""The Black Dahlia"" is for you.

A great, stylish, sinister movie that will haunt you for some time after each viewing. De Palma employs such great techniques as dual/split optics, split screen, split diamater, as well as other great techniques that most filmmakers today either don't know how to use, or are just flat out too lazy to use. It's really scary to me that people enjoy some video game looking CGI stuffed piece of crap over ANY film by De Palma and/or Kubrick and/or any other director that knows how to make stunning visual art, relying on just good ole fashioned acting and a good story to tell the tale, coupled with knowing how to make great use of the lost art of visual storytelling, which this film has plenty of in abundance.

For all you other people who need a ""popcorn"" candy style film that simplifies and/or dumbs down everything in the plot just to please the masses, then pass on this one, but leave the reviews up to people who enjoy the art of filmmaking, and appreciate a great film with a great story when they see one. And quit picking on De Palma for giving us such films to treasure! Thank you.",1302480000,2,8622,4.593242365172189

1582444,1,B00005JP96,"This movie is a serious snooze-fest. It has a well-known cast but they all seemed wrong for the part. Even the most talented actors would not have been able to save this awful script. The movie has a weak, fragmented plot which is a shame because the Black Dahlia murder is a fascinating case and there were some interesting historical events going on at that time. The movie fails to bring any excitement to the story or the time period.  I didn't feel like I was ""transported"" to 1947. I felt like I was watching dressed up actors playing parts on phony sets. The 1947 ambiance wasn't there and neither was the look.

The movie is also very slow paced. We don't even get to Elizabeth Short's story until almost a half hour into the movie. There are also a lot of pointless side stories about boxers, love triangles, adultery, prostitutes, crime, lesbians and whatnot...to the degree that the original point of the movie is lost. This movie is trying to be too many things at once and in doing this a very sad but interesting story is only half told. About 25 minutes of the movie is devoted to the Black Dahlia. The rest of the movie is pretty much made up of fictional characters and invented stories.

It seems like this movie was trying to be a film noir. It really missed the mark. It seemed really modern and `glossy' and had none of the shadows or the dark creepy feel that a film noir should have. Everything seemed too bright, too fake and too pretty. This wasn't a movie about a murdered woman. It was a movie about cops, criminals and sex. In spite of this, there isn't any emphasis on the fact that this was a very shocking crime at the time. In 1947 things like this didn't happen. It was never solved. This could have given the story some great film noir elements but unfortunately the people responsible for this mess didn't understand true film noir.

The movie failed to capture the feel of the 40's era on other levels. Some of the costumes were cool to look at but they didn't have the right look when you compare them to actual movies made in that decade. The actors didn't seem like they ever watched a 1940's movie. The cast was good looking in more a 2000's way than a 1940's way. Beauty trends have changed. The look wasn't there, the accents weren't there. The acting wasn't there and the contrast between glamor and grit wasn't there either...something crucial to good noir...

There is a lot of smoking in the movie and apparently actors of today can't smoke a cigarette and act at the same time! It didn't seem natural. In film noir the lighting is such that it captures the cigarette smoke and creates contrast and an air of mystery. In 40's movies they had a smoking scene strategically placed...usually when things got intense, just like in real life. In this movie everyone is just running around puffing away and it isn't adding to the movie. Unless smoking is used to capture lighting, a mood or make an intense scene more believable, it is a waste. I have no issue with smoking in movies but the actors looked like they were faking it and it wasn't adding to the ambiance or the visuals.

I also didn't like the lack of respect the movie had for the victim Elizabeth Short. The movie was totally insensitive to the fact that she was a real human being and probably had people who loved her. There was nothing in the movie to humanize her. Even her 'father' in the movie doesn't have any remorse or sadness. This doesn't seem believable. Instead of telling us who Elizabeth was as a person, the movie basically portrays her as a tramp that deserved her fate. The real Elizabeth may not have been innocent but no matter what she did wrong in her life, no human being deserves such a horrible death. The movie was delivered more like a glossy, fabricated drama rather than a real life event. The writers added so much ""filler"" to the story trying to beef it up that they lose the point and they lose the audience. The movie goes overboard with cheap thrills and too many sex scenes. The movie doesn't build sympathy for any of the characters. In the end there really is no message.

Even though we already know the story of The Black Dahlia there was a lot about her and the case that were left out. The movie goes off in another direction and forgets one crucial fact: The case is STILL a mystery! A great movie could have been made about this story but this movie failed miserably. Hopefully, one day there will be a movie that honors the life and probes the real mystery of Elizabeth. Until then, we are stuck with this dreck of a movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it! Elizabeth was someone's daughter. If she was mine I would want a movie which better represents who she really was...not this exploitive pile of garbage movie which is written like a cheap novel. I hear the book is better but after seeing this movie, that doesn't seem hard to do. If I want to know more about this case, I think I will stick with the documentaries!",1297209600,,4978,4.451754385964913
1582445,4,B00005JP96,"Firstly, this is the film version of James Ellroy's Black Dahlia novel. It is not a novel that was immensely fact-based. The Black Dahlia Murder Case seems to have been an influence and an inspiration for the book, but will not offer up any insights for those of use who are avid readers/watchers of everything Black Dahlia. Nevertheless, it is worth a look, just because of the subject it was influenced by.

I didn't get an overwhelming sense of the era from this movie though. I like to wach a period piece that is steeped in the aura and feel of the time, like you get from watching 'Mrs. Parker & the Vicious Circle' set in the 1920s.

The cast is decent and the characters are well acted. The script is good. The one overpowering downer about the whole film was two of the female characters Kay Lake (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Elizabeth Short (played by Mia Kirshner.) I found both of them a little annoying.

This film, just as a murder mystery / detective movie is a fairly good one.",1297123200,,999,4.478021978021978
1582446,2,B00005JP96,"First off, like so many others, I couldn't wait to see this film. I've been fascinated by the Black Dahlia case for many years, and I've mostly enjoyed Brian DePalma's movies. Well, this may have been a faithful adaptation of James Ellroy's book, but I didn't like it. It contains a typically (from DePalma) convoluted plot and multiple storylines. There've been other DePalma films, Femme Fatale, Mission Impossible, & Body Double, where I've appreciated, even loved his manic storytelling, but he fell well short of the mark here. The screenwriter, Josh Friedman, shares some of the blame as well.

I didn't care much for these characters, but the movie has its moments. I love Scarlet Johansson in anything, and Hillary Swank gives a good performance, a different character than I've seen her play. They're much better than the male leads. The perverted family of Madeline (Swank) is interesting, and Mia Kirsher as Beth Short was mesmerizing. As another reviewer observed, the lesbian bar scene is hilarious and memorable; the inclusion of kd Lang a great bonus.

Overall the movie is bad in general but even worse due to my high expectations. I wanted to see a well made film about the Dahlia case which this isn't, but it could have been a good film anyway. However, all the confusing plotlines take it nowhere. DePalma should have picked one story and told it. For fans of this genre, I recommend LA Confidential, Chinatown, or even Hollywoodland instead. Maybe someone will film a screen adaptation of Steve Hodel's Black Dahlia Avenger or John Gilmore's Severed.

The DVD special features include lots of James Ellroy. There's a fascinating parallel with his mother and why he wrote the book the way he did. Also, the visual style of DePalma is detailed. The movie, filmed mostly in Bulgaria, is an excellent recreation of 1947 LA, visually.

1582447,2,B00005JP96,"The film fails primarily for the reasons most bad films do- no screenplay of quality, and not because it is fictional and not about its titular subject, although a bit of fidelity to the real case could not have hurt. That said, even had the film been well acted, it is so convoluted and off subject that it bores, despite a plethora of needless narrative convolutions (see above), bad attempts at symbolism (Blanchard and Bleichert are known as Fire and Ice), shocking twists (when Blanchard is killed, his body is cremated in the building he died in by a gangster- why?), dull and pointless subplots (too many to enumerate), red herrings (again, too numerous), camp (Bleichert laying Kay on the kitchen table, after ripping away the tablecloth and dishes, or wearing his fedora in bed with Madeleine), loose ends (as if his shooting of Madeleine- a socialite, would not generate more press than the Dahlia's murder ever did), and `unexpected' revelations (again, too many). What part of this mess lies with Ellroy's book (whose earlier book, L.A. Confidential, was turned into a truly great film ten years ago, by Curtis Hanson), and how much blame belong to Friedman and De Palma, is unclear, but one wonders how De Palma (always a lightweight compared to contemporaries like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola) ever even got tagged with the label that he was Alfred Hitchcock's heir apparent (at best) and imitator (at worst). Regardless, after an atrocity like this, the dead fat man may be rising out of his grave to smite De Palma- that would make for a better film, actually!

  His most famous films- Scarface, Carrie, Body Double, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way- are all either campy messes, imitations of his better peers and classic films noir, or films that try to be noirish mysteries, and while The Black Dahlia is not as bad as Johnny Depp's Jack The Ripper film, From Hell, it's close. Too many details without relevance, payoff, or purpose sink the movie, and its insistence on imitating 1940s films rather than reality (which includes a focus on its titular subject matter) buries it even more deeply. Yes, Scarlett Johansson looks good, but other than her piece of eye candy (Swank, by contrast, has always looked butch), the film has little else going for it, so move over, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, there's a new contender in De Palma's pantheon of bad films, and this one's....oh, to hell with it.

1582497,1,B00005JP96,"Make no mistake: THE BLACK DAHLIA, directed by Brian De Palma, one of history's very worst successful directors, is one of the WORST FILMS EVER MADE. I'm not terribly prone to hyperbole, but I can honestly say that this is a film where the whole thing should have ended up on the cutting-room floor... scratch that... this film should have been BURNED. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but I am going to say a few things.

De Palma returns to the glory of films like WISE GUYS, SNAKE EYES, BODY DOUBLE, and MISSION TO MARS and creates yet another feature film that is absolutely bereft of anything resembling talent, style, or depth.

Aaron Eckhart is wasted, Josh Hartnett is dead-eyed and pathetic, Scarlett Johansson is suffering from Actor's Block, and Hilary Swank... hmm... what can I say about a film where Hilary Swank, a woman who has won Oscars for playing a woman pretending to be a man and a butch female boxer, plays the 'alluring, sensual femme fatale'?!?!?!?!??!!?!?

De Palma has one great film and one good film to his resume: THE UNTOUCHABLES (Great, but it has little to do with him, but with the great performances and the David Mamet script) and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (Good, but he got the right group of talented people around him). SCARFACE works only as a comedy. Yes, I said it. The film that so many alpha-males worship is GARBAGE as a straight-up drama. But if you take it like SHOWGIRLS and refuse to take it seriously, you will be very amused. But THE BLACK DAHLIA isn't even in the ""so bad, it's good"" category. It's just very very very very bad.

Even if a movie is bad, I tend to sit through it just so I can say I watched the whole thing. But this movie was SO slow and confusing and just totally bizarre.

The way it was filmed and cut together made no sense to me and it hardly even dealt with the murder; it was more about some moron cop. I'd rather hear about the killer. I don't recommend this movie at all and I'm surprised anyone else could sit through it, let alone give it a five-star rating.

1582505,2,B00005JP96,"Rich in initial promise, De Palma's plush period drama is ultimately notable only for its utterly unfocused execution and the mostly squandered potential of an A-list cast.

Set against the backdrop of LA in the 1940's, the film revolves alternately around the odd love triangle between its three lead stars, the murder of a young aspiring actress (the titular ""Dahlia"") and socio-political commentary on the corrupt origins of the home of America's film industry. If this wasn't ambitious enough, a vague whisper of the ongoing war in Europe, a subplot about boxing, another about a robbery/blackmail/vendetta, and a host of ancillary characters and events are thrown in for good measure.

The film stutters awkwardly from one event to the next and often fails, throughout its 2 hour course, to address or explain the significance of what is occurring. Even the final ""unmasking"" of the mystery is not convincing enough to illuminate the meaning of the previous 120 minutes. This leaves the viewer with the distinct impression of having watched a very finely polished turd, but a turd none the less.

One gets the impression that De Palma is trying to outdo a film of similar ambition and setting: LA Confidential.

Love Brian DePalma and thought Scarlet Johanson was the sexiest thing in any movie ever in Ghost World and Lost in Translation. So I think part of what happened here is that I had such high expectations the film could never stand up. But also, I think DePalma made a major mistake in trying to be too faithful to the original book. All of Elroy's books are hard to follow and have overlapping plots with lots of characters but Dahlia is one of the most complex. It still works as a book but its too convoluted for a film. The adaptation of L.A. Confidential worked so well because they weren't completely faithful to the book.  The still stayed faithful to all the main parts of the plot but they simplified it enough so that it worked as a movie. Depalma should have done that as well. I also thought that all the actors here were just out of their depth. Perhaps they were too young or picked for looks rather than acting skills.

It certainly looks amazing thanks to production design by Dante Ferretti and photography by the Oscar nominated Vilmos Zsigmond. Everything else about it sucks. Set in the mid to late 40's the film resembles so many films from that era. Which is to say it's melodramatic and  absurdly over the top in spots.  Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are two homicide detectives assigned to the murder case of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) a.k.a. The Black Dahlia so named because of her all black wardrobe and promiscuous nature.  Bleichert is a by the book cop whereas Blanchard is a hothead zoned out on Benzedrine. He becomes obsessed with the Dahlia causing him to alienate his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlet Johansson) and letting a murderer go free. The film throws so many characters and motivations at us in the first half hour that after an hour and a half it's impossible to remember them when DePalma tries to tie up all the loose ends.  It's a losing game because just when you think you've got it under control there is a gaping hole in the logic.  Hilary Swank is useless in the role of Madeline Linscott a rich girl who keeps insisting she looks like the Dahlia when clearly she doesn't.  Her and Bleichert have a steamy affair even though Buck is involved in a love triangle between Lee and Kay. All the sex scenes are ridiculously overheated. The whole film is laughable. The only things that save it are good looking femmes like Johannson, Rose McGowan, and Rachel Miner all of whom look good in the period costumes and hairstyles. The real  highlight for die hard DePalma fans is his re teaming with the Phantom himself William Finley. What does Finley play? A disfigured killer of course.

First we begin with the Zoot suit riots. Why I'm not really sure..but we do. Then we have a boxing match between two young men who later become partners. Why we have this boxing match I'm not really sure. However, I was eating dinner at the time and I must have been more focused on my salad than the movie.

Anyway, Lee Blanchard and Bucky Bleichert are cops investigating pimps, I think. They are partners and there is some sexual tension because Bucky like Lee's wife (at least I think she is his wife). Finally 20 or 25 minutes into the movie we finally get into the Black Dahila murder. Our detectives stumble upon the crime scene because they happened to be in the neighborhood.

What happens next is mostly about the men's lives. We get bits and pieces of the Black Dahila's murder, but not enough to keep my interested in this movie and I nearly drifted off to sleep three times (after I finished eating). There are four different plots going on at once which makes this movie bloated.

The detectives' storyline is the main plot to this story which was aggravating to this viewer. If they wanted the Black Dahila murder to be a subplot, fine, but could it have been a little more prominent than what we got?

The book maybe better. I don't know because I haven't read it. Although books always tend to be better than movies. Still, go with the reviews on this.

1582543,3,B00005JP96,"There's much to like in THE BLACK DAHLIA, the 2006 filming of author James Ellroy best-selling novel that was inspired by Los Angeles' most infamous unsolved murder case.

Director Brian DePalma has not only recreated Los Angeles of the 1940s to perfection, but he has also filled the film with several memorable sequences.

These include the discovery of Elizabeth Short's severed body at the same time that a police shoot-out is taking place on the next block, and, later, a triple murder on a three-story open staircase in an office building.

On the other hand, Ellroy's novel and Josh Friedman's screenplay adaptation are both very complex, with multiple storylines continually criss-crossing to the point where the picture is sometimes difficult to follow.

An audience can only assimilate so much exposition at one time.  Thus, this is that rare movie that would have benefited from a longer running time, so that these storylines could have been better developed.

The principal plot revolves around the relationship between two Los Angeles police detectives, both former boxers who are now partnered.  Josh Hartnett is the younger, more idealistic of the pair, while Aaron Eckhart has the experience, but is also plagued by demons from his past that are stirred up by The Black Dahlia case.  Indeed, he becomes obsessed with Ms. Short's grisly murder.

Scarlett Johansson is Eckhart's platonic girl friend, who is attracted to Hartnett.  She also has a dark secret, as does Hilary Swank, the bi-sexual, nymphomaniac spoiled daughter of a wealthy contractor who Hartnett ultimately discovers is the key to the Dahlia mystery.

There are some fine performances in THE BLACK DAHLIA.  I was most impressed with Mia Kirshner as Ms. Short, Mike Starr as a police detective and, although some critics have disagreed, Ms. Swank as the femme fatale.

The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains three excellent ""Making of"" documentaries, the most interesting of which has Ellroy discussing the facts of the actual The Black Dahlia case and revealing the personal tragedy (i.e. the murder of his mother when he was ten-years-old) that compelled him to write his novel.

There is a domestic scene that is supposed to mean something. Some of those hats don't have the wide brims of that era. Was the fight realistic? Do those scenes of entertainment have a meaning? There is a sudden shoot-out. Next police cars arrive where a body was found. [Do those scenes inside a home look too upscale?] The internal organs of that body were removed by the killer!

The police investigate the death of Elizabeth Short. [Does the film drag here?] Does that girl's family seem strange? ""I'm really so sorry."" That family is strange!

It was almost like watching a stage play; with the dinner at Madeleine's house being excruciatingly painful to watch.

1582600,2,B00005JP96,"Why wasn't this a better film?

The novel (so personal to author James Ellroy who wrote this to honor his murdered mother) has so many incredible elements: a provocative crime, interesting characters, sex and romance, and set in a really evocative time and place.

It certainly wasn't the fault of most of the technical professionals who worked on the film; indeed it has great work by one of the finest cinematographers in the world. Moreover, the cast, on paper, is quite good. So what went wrong to cause this to be so bland, so tedious, and such a whopping misfire?

Answer: Brian De Palma, who's never really managed an intelligent, singular style and usually best when he doesn't try to make his own conscious ""art"". But here his pacing seems way off, as does the overall cinematic movement of the film. I do like the fact this time he avoids pretty much copying Hitchcock (as he's done so much throughout his career) but he couldn't resist the last shot of the dead body: it is photographed in three quick cuts similar to the farmer's death in Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". And, if that isn't enough, De Palma roosts a crow looking down at the body to let us know Hitch was (again and alas) being forced to peer over the director's shoulder.

In summary, this is a disappointment even considering this displays good work by both cast and crew. And it is not even a pale shadow of Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"", a classic of the genre.  I'm thinking William Friedkin, for example, could have made a really effective film here but DePalma missed the target by a mile.",1220918400,3,1573,4.643884892086331
1582601,1,B00005JP96,"Even though it is still one of California's unsolved murders, the whole Elizabeth Short case can be told in about 60 seconds.  So making a 2 hour movie would be quite a feat.  That's why the director factored the L.A. ""Zoot Suit"" riots of 1943, a boxing match, the killing of black pimps and prostitutes who were minding their own business, the dysfunctional love affair between Scarlett Johansson's character and Josh Harnett's partner, a bunch of very chic lesbians, and the bizarre wealthy family of a bi-sexual Hilary Swank (does her mother have Parkinson's or is that the actress' idea of an alcoholic socialite?)

We didn't hear about the murder until 20 minutes had passed and only then because it happened on the street behind the pimp shoot-out.  Somehow the ""first responders"" on the Black Dahlia crime scene didn't hear all of that gun fire  on the other side of the building.  Instead of going to the rescue of their fellow officers, they and a dozen reporters stood transfixed on the naked body in the park.  So much for ""Officer down!  Send back-up!""  The best thing about this movie was the autopsy which was done in a compelling narrative by a jowly M.E.  That's about all we learned about this murder victim who was made out to be a slut who slept with men AND women in exchange for a sandwich or pair of nylons.  In fact, there was not one woman in this movie who was not depicted as prostitute, golddigger, or tramp.  Only the lesbians had class and dignity - and there is a gang of them!  (Look for an uncredited k.d. lang in a great piece of camp.)

Hartnett has the charisma of a grape.  Johansson fits right in during an era when 20 year-old women looked like they were 35.  But she handles a lame role like a pro. I don't know why Swank was even in the area.  And that accent!  I couldn't figure out if she was a ""Valley Girl"" or a Nazi!

Many of facts of the murder are wrong - Elizabeth Short's dad didn't live in Los Angeles - he lived in Vallejo, a good 8 hour drive north, 30 miles above San Francisco.  Here he lives right down the street.  Nothing was said about his staging him a suicide and sneaking off to Vallejo, abandoning Elizabeth's mother with 5 girls to raise alone in Massachusetts.  He surfaced years later, trying to reunite with his wife, who declined.  The ""Zoot Suit Riots"" were in 1943 and the Dahlia case was in 1947.  Here they all happened within a few months.  I understand ""literary license"" but here it wasn't used to make an existing story better - it was used to try to create something which wasn't much to start with.

The production has a great ""film noir"" feel - I was expecting Mickey Spillane to walk in.  But this movies should have just been ""FILM NO""!  Brian De Palma, what were you thinking?",1217721600,38,2757,4.449101796407185

Now, I am a big advocate of a movie with subtlety, which most people find slow and boring, but this is slow and boring, and without subtlety.  Just a reason to put Mia Kirshner in some sexy scenes before she is killed.
Now, this was based on a true event from many years ago, and with true stories, Hollywood normally jazzes them up a bit.  Now here, the story was changed and they added some stuff, but you know, it really did not add much to the movie.

How many movies(or books) did we dislike upon seeing or reading because our expectations were high or awry prior to examination?  Have you ever read a book or seen a movie that you had low expectations for that was actually quite enjoyable?

Today I experienced just that with The Black Dahlia.  I picked up a used copy for $5.00 knowing how it has been roasted here and elsewhere.  Therefore my expectations were quite low. I was infinitely surprised at how entertaining this movie is!  Not only was it visually stunning in the usual De Palma fashion but it was intellectually challenging and rewarding. It made me think.  I like movies that do that and many don't these days.  Too many are formulaic.  I am afraid that many of the harsh critics of this movie unfairly compared it to the book(books are almost always better than the corresponding movie due to the imagination factor).  I am afraid that many of the critics expected unfairly for it to be all about the Elizabeth Short murder. Maybe they should have read the book.  Expectations.

I really enjoyed this movie and did not find it THAT hard to follow. Yes, I got confused a few times but not too much for an initial viewing of this complex movie.  So five star to me means superb, four stars-excellent.  In my opinion this is a good movie, thus I rate it 3 stars.  I really feel that many have not given the movie a fair shake but so be it.  We are all entitled to our own opinions. However I do wonder if we have become so conditioned in todays society that if something does not gel with our preconceived notions we prematurely reject it?  Something to ponder.

I will keep this movie and watch it again.  My copy of Raising Cain on the other hand long ago found the used bins.  Now there was a boring movie. Extremely predictable with little surprise element.

1582637,2,B00005JP96,"Brian De Palma is one of the most frustrating working directors.  Though prolific, he's yet to make a great movie and has many disasters to his name.  His particular specialty is reverse alchemy, De Palma takes movies that might have been great and snatches failure from the jaws of victory.  He came closest to excellence in The Untouchables, but if you remove Sean Connery from that film what you have left is Kevin Costner doing his best to impersonate a petrified oak.  Performances that bad are always the director's fault.  You simply cannot strike the set until you have what you need in the can.  The Black Dahlia is a virtual primer on the inadequacies that have dogged De Palma's career.

Instead of a coherent, interesting screenplay with characters worth caring about, what you have is the empty artifice of cinema - period clothing, architecture, cars, and idiomatic speech.  For a while that's all engaging enough to help you overlook the lack of story.  When you do start wondering what's going on, what you discover is a handful of unrelated plotlets tossed into a blender and reassembled.  Police corruption, two friends who boxed, a romantic triangle, the unfortunate aspiring starlet known as The Black Dahlia, K.D. Lang, and a fabulously rich family so absurdly eccentric it's over the top even by Hollywood standards.  Since it's De Palma, naturally there is grotesque, gratuitous violence, but because we never know anything about the perpetrators even that fails to generate a jolt.  What happened to the real life Elizabeth Short is horrifying beyond all reason; only De Palma's tepid detachment could make such extreme cruelty dull.

As Detective Lee Blanchard, Aaron Eckhart comes closest to delivering an actual performance.  By contrast, Josh Hartnett, as his partner, is both dreadfully miscast and downright difficult to watch.  Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank - both highly skilled in their craft - seem to be sleepwalking through caricatures rather than playing actual people.  In numerous scenes they are out-acted by what they're wearing.  This appalling waste of talent must be blamed entirely on De Palma.  Only Mia Kirshner saves the day, appearing posthumously in short B&W audition films where she is speaking directly to the camera.  As Elizabeth Short - The Black Dahlia - she is the film's tragic heart.  In better hands, a script, and a movie, could have been built out from this center - then perhaps it would have been about a person, instead of being a dog's breakfast of Hollywood stereotypes and cliches.

As a final note.  You simply haven't experienced bad directing until you see Fiona Shaw's swansong, she makes Al Pacino look like Marcel Marceau.  De Palma's ability to find funding time and again does make one wonder if he has extremely incriminating photos in a safe deposit box.

1582642,1,B00005JP96,"The Black Dahlia may be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Brian De Palma's directing is among the worst in Hollywood (at least Michael Bay is entertaining).  De Palma makes such an abysmal mess of this story that I wonder if he wasn't sued for purposely train-wrecking James Ellroy's novel by the same name.  Since there's nothing much positive to say about the movie, let's spend some time ridiculing its many faults.

First, De Palma manages to preempt every actor's attempt to dramatize the incoherent script and stock noir dialogue.  Scarlett Johansson is given absolutely nothing to do, and De Palma films her doing nothing.  Her character comes off as entirely irrelevant.  She wears the same color outfits throughout the entire movie.  She looks like a throw pillow designed to accent the wallpaper and sofa rather than a character in a movie.

The royal pool boy, Josh Hartnett, is miscast as the brooding Dwight ""Bucky"" ""Mr. Ice"" Bleichert (yes, he has three first names).  Hartnett is too pretty to be moody and too young to be a believable noir male lead.  The noir male has seen everything.  He doesn't cry.  He looks rough, has a cold stare, and says tough things.  Hartnett does none of these convincingly until the very end of the film, when most sane people have already taken the movie back to the store to rent Beerfest to get the bad taste out of their mouths.

While most of the cast is comprised of character actors and miscast noir stock, the only actor who comes away unscathed is Mia Kirshner (who plays Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia herself).  She understands that her character is a corpse, and she engages the audience's sympathy directly.  And she manages this with bad dialogue from a screen test for a porno film.  The other lead actors fail to create believable characters, and her fine performance seems wasted.

The earth tone palette of everything in the movie (costumes, furniture, buildings, lighting, etc.) fails as a 1940s faade.  Why must films from the era of the American gangster be compulsively drenched in sepia and silhouetted by smoky shadows?

De Palma and his editor, Bill Pankow, really need to quit working together.  Neither is able to piece the story together in a convincing manner.  Three stories are lined up side-by-side: The Black Dahlia's death, a troubled cop and his reformed prostitute and her pimp, and an incestuous Hollywood family.  It sounds crazy, and it should have been, but De Palma and Pankow manage to make it utterly boring.  They rest the movie's success on Josh Harnett's weak narration and clunky acting.

But maybe it was just a stupid story from the get go.  The screenwriter, Josh Friedman, certainly deserves to be mocked incessantly for writing such nonsense, but being that De Palma's films are generally terrible, I can't assign blame to Friedman solely.

The movie desperately wants to be L.A. Confidential, but it lacks the directing, acting, compelling story, editing, and overall polished production value one should expect from a feature film.  Skip this one.  There are better neo-noir films out there: Chinatown, Road to Perdition, Red Rock West, to name a few.",1197331200,6,3174,4.878504672897196

As the film slowly moves through fictional events in time, we get to the real-life death of wannabe actress Elizabeth Short or as she more famously became known as ""The Black Dahlia."" The film then explores the author's version of what really happend to this poor young lady and the question that still haunts people today, ""who done it?"" Through out the film we are introduced to a number of boring characters such as Scarlet who is Aaron's love interest but becomes Josh's infatuation as well. Aaron's character becomes possessed if you will be solving this murder, a possession that eventually leads to his demise and the truth finally coming out.
To the casual reader, this movie made sound fairly interesting and worth checking out. However, to those of us who have already been tortured by it, we can surely tell you, you are not missing much.

The plot has some many twists in it, that viewers will find themselves in a seizer trying to stay with it.
I was very surprised how much this film left to be desired and almost wish that the author had stuck to fact and not his pathetic attempt at making it interesting.",1192406400,4,1674,4.5647840531561465
1582699,5,B00005JP96,"I think the main problem with this movie is that the viewer might be prone to judge it by a completely irrelevant set of standards.  It's not what one would expect.  The acting is not bad - it's just not the type of acting most of us are accustomed to seeing in a modern film.  Judge it instead by comparing it to films from the era.  Some of the facial expressions, the gestures, are classic - easily recognizable from the genre.  Think about films from the forties.  Think about Garland,  Hayworth, Grable and Bogart.  I found myself wanting to make a game of counting how many tricks from the genre I could find.  They were obviously having fun with it.

The central plot of the movie isn't the life and death of the Black Dahlia, but so what?  Sometimes in order to enjoy a movie it's necessary to adjust one's expectations.  The movie was never intended to be anything other than what it is.  It succeeds because it accomplishes exactly what was intended - not because it meets the expectations of the viewer.

I gave this film 5 stars because it made me think, watch it more intently.  This movie is subtle while appearing to be obvious on the surface.  Some of the humor is hidden.  I prefer a movie that makes the viewer work a little.  If you want it handed to you, if you prefer today's typical Hollywood fare, avoid this one.

An honorable mention to the scene with K. D. Lang.  Listen to the rich textures of her voice.  Watch the polished synchronicity of the dancers.  That scene alone is worth the whole movie.",1191888000,5,1525,4.4296028880866425
1582700,3,B00005JP96,"Before the first half-hour was over, there were indications that THE BLACK DAHLIA was destined to fall far from the mark. For one thing, it fails to focus on the Elizabeth Short story.

For all the rich texture of the monochromatic cinematography (so we'd know we're watching a modern film noir), all the posturing of SCARLETT JOHANSSON with her long cigarette holder, all the fake glamor of HILARY SWANK, and all the convoluted plot lines, it's hard to find a trace of the Elizabeth Short story here. And that's the film's main problem. Her story is really just background filler for some very complicated fictional characters and situations that exist outside the story of THE BLACK DAHLIA, a murder never actually solved.

While watching it unfold, I couldn't help thinking how much better this would have been as a gritty film noir back in the '40s in the sort of shimmering B&W photography that Michael Curtiz used for THE UNSUSPECTED--and with an actor like Humphrey Bogart as the lead detective with either Lauren Bacall or Lizabeth Scott as the femme fatale. And if they needed a brunette siren they could always use Marie Windsor. Hilary Swank really has done much better work elsewhere.

Furthermore, the story chosen from the James Elroy novel which does give a solution to the crime, is an absurd one that is not made even remotely believable by the creation of the Fiona Shaw character who seems to be existing in another movie--a farce. Nor is the narration spoken by Josh Hartnett--in a monotone that I found alienating--any help in explaining the twisted course of events.

DePalma missed the opportunity in bringing the Elizabeth Short story to the screen as stark drama in any way that makes sense. Because of its assured style, it's a very watchable film despite all the flaws--and you keep hoping something better will happen in the last thirty minutes to explain motives and to close in on the final chapter of Short's life, but no--no such luck. It fizzles to an artificial conclusion dreamed up by author Elroy. Alas, even Mark Isham's bombastic score doesn't work although it sounds good over the closing credits.

It's a classic example of style over substance, but this time the style can't hide the fact that the script is largely incomprehensible and goes far astray of its subject matter instead of keeping a narrow focus on the actual story.",1191801600,17,2371,4.858910891089109

Why'd they have to make up fiction around the story? This was a major missed opportunity - if they'd just did a straight dramatization of what actually happened (as much as is known, anyway), this could have been a much, much better film. But it's a bunch of ""lies & made-up facts"" (to quote Steve Martin from his standup days), and the sad part is someone is making money based around an unsolved tragedy - the least they could have done was to have got the story right. A documentary-style feature film, with realistic reenactments interspersed with actual footage would have been much better (would have HAD to have been, compared to this mess). And, by the way, what happened to Brian DePalma? He used to make really good movies such as Dressed To Kill and Body Double.

There was no suspense in this crime drama, and honestly, the best part of the film was the boxing segments in the beginning of the film which truly showed some graphic violence and excitement.  Otherwise, I was totally bored and recommend avoiding this movie at ALL costs.  The only thing nice about the film was the scenery presentatation which truly looked like something from the 1940's.

I was enthused, even heading into the second hour but as time went on I began to become less involved with the story. That's probably because none of the characters are likable people that I would care about. With no one to really root for, after awhile the movie loses its appeal.

The worst part was the last 20 minutes. It was so sordid, it got absurd. It's too much corruption, sick people, ugly violence and nasty overall attitude. The ""Linscott"" family is so bad I could do little but just shake my head in disgust. The whole thing wound up too depressing. When it's over, you want to take a shower.

1582739,1,B00005JP96,"Based on the true story of the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, THE BLACK DAHLIA is no homage to the young lady. It isn't even historically accurate.

Film noir really should be restricted to black and white. Director Brian DePalma (who has created a very uneven body of work over the years)  knows this, and so he tries to create atmospherics in THE BLACK DAHLIA by switching between B & W and color. It doesn't help.

Baby-faced Josh Hartnett, who still looks like he should be doing teen fare, is hideously miscast as a cop in 1940s LA who is trying to unravel the truth behind the gruesome murder-mutilation of the young would-be starlet. Hartnett's role cries out for granite-faced grit and toughness (think Sam Spade) but instead we get Mr. John Q. Sensitivity. Aaron Eckert, who plays his partner, is similarly fresh-faced. Neither of these guys even has stubble on their chins. I doubt they shave, even in real life.

Scarlett Johanssen plays their shared girlfriend. Johanssen, who usually gives it her all onscreen, starts out strong, but, realizing this film is a turkey, decides to save her energy for a better day.

The best performance of the film belongs to Hilary Swank, who is lush, lustful and convincing, not to mention Ava Gardner gorgeous, in her uninhibited role as a sex kitten. But even the presence of the two-time Oscar winner does not redeem this film which meanders unevenly and oft-times pointlessly through its dim, confused storyline, which includes outre sex, drugs, murder, family scandal, money, multiple betrayals, and not one character worth saving.

While all of the above are de riguer for film noir, merely flinging all these elements together in a heap and adding a few fedoras for flavor does not a movie make. Motive is missing, as is real tension, hence the real darkness that makes a film truly noir. Without a clear-cut story, and with just too many subplots, THE BLACK DAHLIA becomes a waste of time. In the end, you just don't give a damn whodunit.",1186876800,2,2006,4.8

1582742,1,B00005JP96,"First off let me say I have never thought Mr. De Palma was that great a director. He has made some good films(Carrie, the Untouchables, and even Mission Impossible), but for the most part he seems to borrow (read steal) shots and ideas from Alfred Hitchcock(at least he steals from the best) and also likes to have a fluid moving camera to cover his lack of originality. Even with my feelings on him I felt he might be able to pull this compelling true murder case off and make it interesting. WRONG!!!!!!
  The film is lazy film making, he even allows the camera to just sit there for long stretches of time and builds absolutely no suspense to this tale. The actors seem to be trying hard but no one is able to raise above the weak and meandering script. The only one who turns in a great performance is the young woman playing the ""Dahlia"".  Seen in flashbacks and some sordid films, she brings more life to this movie than the others combined.
  I know this is based on a novel, but the thing i find the most unforgivable is they way they use Miss Short's horrible death as the foundation for the movie and then trash the poor woman's name by painting her out as a borderline Hooker/stag film star. Nowhere in the real facts was that ever found and in fact the true facts seem to be of little importance to the film makers. Miss Short died in a most gruesome way, why should she have her name pulled through the mud after the fact. This more than any of the other reasons is why I find the movie to be an insult to her, her family, and finally us. Look up the real tale and enlighten yourself about the case and see how they have done a disservice to her.
  I also find it iresponsable that they chose to ""solve"" this unsolved case, which is what Hollywood does best, Watch the film ""The Zodiac(2007)"" and see how a story about and unsolved crime can and should be handled.
  Once again Holly2wood rewrites history for it's own gain and lets a young woman, who may have been less than a saint, be turned into a ""stag film"" star instead of the real person she was.
  NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
  If you like it, well I'm happy for you and guess you will hate this review,, but this is how the movie came across to me.",1185494400,7,2234,4.27790973871734
1582743,2,B00005JP96,"The story of Elizabeth Short is the epitome of exploitation. Her Hollywood dreams were exploited, leading her personal and professional lives down sordid and unwanted avenues; her death was exploited by the media, who dubbed her the Black Dahlia and delighted in every tawdry fact and gaudy headline; but the most offensive exploitation is this movie.

One would expect that with its title, this film would be about the Black Dahlia murder, a gruesome act of butchery that was the American equivalent of the Jack the Ripper murders. One would expect it to be about the clash of innocence with horror, tabloid journalism with human emotion, the glitziness of Hollywood with the murky reality on the streets of LA. You'd also be forgiven for thinking it's about Elizabeth Short, the manner in which she was killed, the `missing week' between the time she was last seen and the estimated time of death, her `black book' of men's names and addresses, the fifty or so people who confessed to the crime and the investigation into it. If so, you'd be almost entirely wrong.

The Black Dahlia is about one thing only - Brian de Palma's homage to the trench coat-wearing, chain-smoking heyday of film noir. It's all there, like a paint-by-numbers mockery: monotone Chandler-esque voiceover, check; black-clad femme fatale, check; pouting blonde, corrupt cops, sprawling plot and little resolution, all checked. It even has the obligatory financially wealthy/morally corrupt, slightly incestuous family of oddballs who made their money through low-quality construction and bankroll porn films in their spare time. Yet what it lacks are all those things that made noir great - likeable characters (Marlowe), snappy dialogue (The Big Sleep), charismatic stars (Bogie), and the ever-present sense of danger lurking in the shadows. Films like Chinatown and LA Confidential have shown that this can be done in colour, but de Palma fails on every account.

But perhaps the biggest thing missing from the Black Dahlia is history. Whereas in JFK we learn about JFK and in Erin Brokovich we learn about Erin Brokovich - heck, in Titanic we learn about Titanic - in the Black Dahlia we learn next to nothing about the Black Dahlia. Indeed, seeing as the original Dahlia case was all about looking, in the sense of voyeuristic media interest, the movie is more about looking away. It's 30 minutes before the Dahlia makes her (posthumous) appearance, and de Palma seems rather squeamish about it all, preferring to point the camera at Kd Lang, lesbian sex scenes, Johansson pouting, Swank trying to prove she's female, in fact ANYTHING other than the Dahlia investigation. We learn that Aaron Eckhart's character is becoming obsessed with the case, basically because we're told, quite explicitly, ""he's becoming obsessed with the case,"" and because he stares at pictures of Short and frowns. But it's like we're being kept at arm's length - we get no interiority on the characters or the case, and the murder is more about advancing fictional (and dull) plotlines instead of being a plotline in and of itself. Considering these men are supposed to be obsessed with the Dahlia, they never seem to talk about, think about or do anything about the case.

Then, out of the blue, we break into an exposition-laden final Act that runs like a Scooby-Doo finale - ""this is what we did and this is how we did it, and why? Because we're crazy, and that's what crazy people do. The End."" To say this is unsatisfying is an understatement. I know it's based on a novel, but a director of de Palma's influence should surely be able to make a tweak here, a change there, and show a little integrity. Instead, he takes the real-life murder of a real human being and trivialises it. Had the murder at the core of this film been fictional, I might have given this three stars, even four. It looks great in a squeaky-clean, Pat Boone kind of way, a Rococo artist's fantasy of the 40's, and it's quite refreshing that you have to concentrate on everything really hard else you'll get lost in the mire. Likewise, Mrs. Linscott's overblown overacting is a real hoot, the height of unintentional camp. But to `solve' the Black Dahlia case in such a trite fashion, to use that tragic death as an excuse to shoot meaningless gunfights and sex scenes, to glamorise the glitzy Hollywood ideal using a case that should, to anyone with half a brain, expose it for the sham that it is, is artistically, emotionally and morally heartless. Symbolically there is something very disturbing about de Palma himself playing a slightly-perverse, exploitative casting agent speaking off-camera directly to the Dahlia in her audition tapes. Or perhaps it is fitting: he is the director who has perpetrated this, the worst exploitation of Elizabeth Short's memory imaginable.",1184544000,8,4812,4.951732673267327

I'd like to laugh, but I'm too angry at the filmmakers for botching a great story based on a fine novel by a top-notch writer. The bad acting and ""so bad it's funny"" scenes made me groan w/ disappointment rather than laugh. I love crime dramas and Brian De Palma is one of my favorite directors. Even having read all the bad reviews and bad buzz about this film over the past several months, I was still ready to like it. Considering the talent involved, I thought it couldn't be that bad. I just assumed all the negative buzz was similar to that produced by impatient individuals who lack adult attention spans, much like those who complained about the excellent ""Miami Vice"" last year. After watching it though.... Wow.

They could use ""The Black Dahlia"" in film schools as a case study for screenwriters on how not to adapt a novel for the screen: remove all of the important story details; include superfluous story details; cram too much of the story into a 2 hour movie; make sure it makes no sense to people who haven't read the novel; dramatize scenes from the novel in an overly literal manner without adapting them to the cinematic medium.

I couldn't believe my eyes at the poor acting. Scarlet Johannson??? Hilary Swank??? Great actresses and they were horrible! Were people who did not read the novel supposed to know that Swank's character looked like the Black Dahlia based on Bleichert's glib comment? Character motivation was nonexistent. Characters bounce from one scene to another while viewers have no clue why they do what they do or say what they say. I can't believe I'm complaining about this, but the warm, dull-brownish sepia toned cinematography was a horrible choice for a color scheme.

I hate to say it, but the crime drama may have reached its zenith in the 1990s (Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, Casino, Heat, L.A. Confidential, the 3 stellar Elmore Leonard adaptations). Maybe it's all downhill from here (except The Departed).

**NOTE
I am not one of those people who nitpicks about film verisons of novels not being exactly like the novel. But a skilled screenwriter knows how to streamline a novel; remove what is not cinematic and keep what works while trying to maintain character development in small clever ways that do not involve lame narration. Example: L.A. Confidential (riveting to the end w/ useful narration; also from an Ellroy novel).",1182729600,5,2484,4.823943661971831
1582798,4,B00005JP96,"Well here is my critique w/o ruining the
movie for you:

This was a great 2006 movie but, sadly,
not at with all the elements I expected.

Had watched an excellent documentary
about the possible murderer being a
wealthy surgeon and socialite and
molester of his own daughter, who
ran in the circles of Michelle Phillips
(of The Mamas & Papas band).
Think it was a 48 Hrs. Mystery.

Somehow, I expected some of this
movie to take place in the present,
as a detective actually discovered
his own father was likely the killer
in the documentary I had seen.

None of that was part of this
fictionalized account. Not to say,
the intrigue was not high. Just that
I expected the coincidence about
the man speaking about his own
father on his death bed and all,
was missing.

Also, the style was all set in
retro late 1940's. That made
me feel like I was reading a
history book at times and
not living in the new millenium
when NEW DISCOVERIES about
this age-old BIGGEST UNSOLVED
homicide in L.A. had been made.

It was a very good movie
and Hilary Swank was
impressive in it, but if I
were a producer, would
have done it a different way.

Nothing was mentioned about
the photos that played a part
of key evidence for the detective
thinking his father was involved either...
And I wanted to see the lavish parties
the doctor apparently threw, when
his children were asleep--or not.

And the men that were involved in
such a tight-knit group, that the
death of an acquaintance would be
covered up together.

I don't know what parts were
cut from this release but I wish
some of these parts had been in
it. The actual story is so amazing.",1182038400,,1628,4.436241610738255
1582799,1,B00005JP96,"What a disappointment. I bought this DVD in Target on impulse. Bad move, bad movie. While I never read the book, I did see a version of the Black Dahlia a number of years ago starring Lucy Arnaz as Elizabeth Short. It was an absorbing film, compelling, very well done. The major focus was on the mystery of who the Black Dahlia was, where she came from, trying to piece together her life in L.A. It was done in flashbacks showing Elizabeth Short in quick scenes up to the point where she was murdered.

This movie rambles on for about an hour before the murder is introduced, and then the focus doesn't stay on it, but bounces around on a bunch of shallow, boring characters. It all has about as much essence as confetti flying around on a windy day. I was sorry to see Hilary Swank in such a feeble production.",1181865600,2,811,4.3355263157894735

Who would have guessed just how bad Hillary Swank and Scarlet Johansson could be?  It takes an iron will to watch this to the end, but unless you do, you can't truely appreciate the depth to which De Palma is willing to plunge in his exciting denouement.

1582832,3,B00005JP96,"In an Ellroy novel, cops are corrupt in ways that Hammett, Chandler and Cain never dreamed of. The two cops fight a bogus boxing match promoted by the Department, in which Josh Hartnett is paid off Terry Molloy style, to throw the fight to his blondish partner Aaron Eckhardt. A Department Spin Doctor immortalizes 'Fire and Ice' in the Tabloid press. Eckhardt and Hartnett have something close to a menage going with the very hot Scarlett Johannsen, who is dolled up to look like Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Johannsen is hot just three years after stealing the movie in a second lead in a Steve Buscemi indie comedy Ghost World.

Ellroy/De Palma weave their entirely independent story about two cops around the real Black Dahlia story. The Dahlia is seen in Gower Gulch level studio screen test flashbacks in which Betty Short talks to a director off-screen: DePalma.

Despite their closeness, Eckhardt is holding out on the naive Hartnett. Hartnett and Johansson are falling in love, Eckhardt barely noticing. Eckhardt continues to secretly gumshoe the Dahlia Crime while the Department complains about his truancy from duty. Hartnett covers for him and woos Scarlett. Finally, Hartnett follows Aaron to a a major showdown at a museum.

The Black Dahlia is the descendant of all the film noir, LA corruption stories and Los Angeles crime myth that rise like steam from LA. Black Dahlia is the offspring but not the equal of Chinatown, itself a promulgator of the LA Corruption myth, and the first film to link the real life LA Times Chandler Family and Water Commissioner Edward Mulholland, who annexed Owens Valley's water supply, into the general LA malaise first captured by former oil company exec Raymond Chandler in Black Mask Magazine. Before Chandler, there was no 'there there' in the city of Angels.

The film is complex and a challenge to follow, but a boon to an audience starved for intellectual nourishment at the movies. At the concession stand, twenty-something employees said the movie was ""wierd' and kids couldn't understand what was going on. The Kids, raised in an era columnist Clarence Page calls dumbed down by Ronald Reagan, now get their information, even education, from pop culture in high concept form, only a little tougher than a Dick and Jane book. A fortyish couple with two teenagers in tow, sat in front of me. The two kids left in twenty minutes and didn't return. Their parents sat engrossed until the end.

Hillary Swank is the doyenne of a corrupt family that puts one in mind of the family Sam Spade visited in Farewell My lovely. Even the Twins in the Chandler film - screen-written by William Faulkner- get a workout in the Ellroy/DePalma tale. It turns out Swank, a dead ringer for the late Judy Garland, is an heiress Skank, who has been wearing the exact hairstyle, black dress and makeup of the Black Dahlia. Hartnett finds out that Swank was her friend. Fiona Shaw, an Irish actress, is Swank's eccentric, haughty, and insane mother, who during dinner conversation reveals her hideous insinuations about Skanks'., I mean Swank's incestuous relationship with her father, who is present but uncomfortable at the table. Some of this stuff is hilarious but it is played straight.

Hillary entertains Johns just for Kinky kicks, even though she doesn't need the money. Hartnett interrupts one such date with a very plump GI, whose clothes and mien are so interesting and awful the audience wants to know more about him.

If you're fast enough to pick up the flitting details from dialog, you can probably figure out in the hour and a half afterward it took a friend and I to crack it. We loved it. Its in the grand tradition.",1181001600,,3695,4.855555555555555
1582833,1,B00005JP96,"horror...I watched this...movie (?) open-mouthed, literally, waiting (in vain) for some MENTION of Elizabeth Short (remember her, gentlemen???? You did title this fiasco BLACK DAHLIA; did you not?) but instead was treated to a fight, the relationship between two cops and the girlfriend, the constant mention of Fire and Ice (big Revlon lipstick campaign in the 1950s) and an assortment of peripheral characters I was supposed to be intrigued by. Well, don't know about anyone else, but I was under the impression this movie, titled BLACK DAHLIA, was actually ABOUT THE ELIZABETH SHORT MURDER CASE.

Was I WRONG! The most laborious, dull boring, contrived, self-centered piece of garbage I have ever suffered through. Why did I watch the whole thing? Two reasons: One, I could not believe at some point the movie would turn a corner and actually address the TITLE CHARACTER and two, I couldn't believe anything this bad actually got made and released to an unsuspecting public!!!!

Gentlemen, you DID title this movie BLACK DAHLIA, did you not? Why, then, was she relegated to BACKGROUND for two of the dullest cops to ever come down the pike?????

Who CARES about the cops and the g/f? At least if you have believed in truth in advertising and titled the moive (for lack of a better word) Two Cops and the Girlfriend I could have understood and would not have made the mistake of BUYING this...movie.

I am appalled. Utter dreck from start to finish, the one semi-redeeming scene was the one with k.d. Lang (sp) singing in the lesbian palace.

I saw a Robert Stack TV show re: Elliot Ness covering the Cleveland Torso slayings and the theory (a rather strong and credible one, BTW) that a rich society man, totally deranged, had committed these atrocities but voluntarily admitted himself to a mental health facility. Of course, he just as easily signed himself out and it was rumored traveled to Hollywood about the same time as the Dahlia slaying. After this man committed himself, the Cleveland Torso slayings abruptly stopped. Ness, famous for his inability to be corrupted, went to his grave with the name of the killer never to be revealed. (Did the family's incredible wealth buy Ness's silence this one time?) This TV show was light years more compelling and more interesting than this entire...movie.

So blaring trumpets, sepia tints and horrendous dialogue do not a classic movie make, and this one tries hard and fails totally on ever level.

I am embarrassed FOR the moviemakers...not one redeeming quality; not even good camp. Plan Nine from Outer Space is an Academy Award winner compared to his!

Hopefully someday someone will come along and actually make a movie titled Black Dahlia that EXPLAINS and SHOWS the Black Dahlia instead of using the name to promote this...movie.

It is impossible to imgaine anyone taking this fascinating subject and making such a horrible...movie, but that is exactly what happened here.

God save us from any more collaborations between De Palma (who really should retire after this...movie) and Ellroy, who should know better.

This atmosphere was far better realized in Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, to name two vastly superior films. The frantic ""love"" scene on the table was also vastly superior in The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. You could FEEL the heat in that one; this was a BAD comedy.",1180396800,2,3386,4.975221238938053
1582834,2,B00005JP96,"I bought the ""Black Dahlia"" with high expectations which were soon disappointed! I had read the dark, complex, descent into hell novel by James Ellroy. Ellroy's historical fiction novel is the basis of this film. Alas, the book is much better than the movie!

  In January 1947 the nude, mutilated body of film starlet Elizabeth Short was found in a field in Los Angeles. The murder has and will never be solved. What the film does is to spin a tale of two LA cops seeking to discovere the killer.  The two are called Fire and Ice due to their boxing prowess. They fight a charity bout for the LA Police Department; love the same woman and their lives descend into tragedy and death.

  We see LA in 1947 in darkly lit sepia tones very appropriate to film noire. The cars, the clothes and the postwar music is on target.

  The only problems are:

a. An overcomplex, confusing and silly story line that strains credibility! We can accept such a story when it is in the hands of a director of genius such as Howard Hawks in  his classic ""The Big Sleep"" but not from Brian DePalma who is not a the top of his directorial game!

b. The film's three star actors: Josh Harnett; Scarlet Johannson and

Hillary Swank look like 21st century kids going through the motions. This film cries out for the likes of Bogie, Stanwyck, Bacall, Jimmy Cagney,

Sterling Hayden, Virginia Bruce, Dick Powell or Alan Ladd (who starred in the film noir classic ""The Blue Dahlia""). Harnett is a cardboard actor emitting little emotion drawing no empathy from this reviewer. Scarlett is lovely but she fails to move the viewer to empathy for her sordid past. Only Hillary Swank is fairly good as she portrays an evil lady who comes from cruel parents and a ditzy sister. The two time Best Actress Oscar winner will not be noted for this role.

  If you want to see a much better modern film noir check out ""Hollywood

land"" dealing with the death of George Reeves.

  ""The Black Dahlia"" deservedly bombed at the boxoffice., The musical score is at times so loud you can't hear the dialogue. The movie could have been so much better with more mature worldworn looking actors; a better director and a script which makes sense not confusing the audience.",1180396800,2,2226,4.568181818181818
1582835,2,B00005JP96,"Despite the cast of A-List actors, the best thing about this film is the glorious noir photography of Vilmos Zsigmund. The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's ""Chinatown"" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation (""L.A. Confidential""), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more.  The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself.",1180310400,2,668,5.072727272727272
1582836,2,B00005JP96,"You know what it's about: a movie based on a book that fictionalizes a true crime, in this case, the horrific Betty Short murder-mutilation case now known as ""The Black Dahlia"".  ""Dahlia"" is actually several different types of film rolled into one: a buddy-cop movie, period LA Noir flick and a based-on-a-true-story movie - all being types that Hollywood has tackled with decided ineptitude on their own, and now Hollywood has added another painful reminder of that failure.  (Only ""LA Confidential"" managed to rise above the pack, even as an imperfect masterpiece that easily outstrips ""Dahlia"".)

The flick follows the ""Dahlia"" legend through the story of Blanchard (Eckhardt) and Bleichert (Hartnett), both ambitious but scandal-tinged LA cops of the immediate post-war City of Angels.  Sharing a love of boxing and Scarlett Johannsen, the two are only apparently two of a kind, but in reality represent polar opposites.  The unusually prescient media call them ""Fire and Ice"", and when the ""Dahlia"" story breaks, they are an odious DA's natural choice.  Instead, the case soon begins to break the two star cops, unhinging Blanchard and driving his wife into Bleichert's arms.  Bleichert himself begins to doubt the case is solvable and counsels his good friend to drop it, even as he continues to follow leads.  Instead of returning to his normal duties of pulling in dangerous felons at large, Bleichert pieces together threads that point to a rich Hollywood land developer, the underground pornography industry, and a rich bisexual heiress played by Hilary Swank.

You know how you can sit through a bad movie and not realize how you've been taken until the credits roll?  I saw ""Dahlia"" last night, and even before that mid-movie haze wore off, I realized the painful botch I'd gotten myself into.  ""Dahlia"" probably appealed to its studio as one of those movies that makes no sense but looked like something that could survive on style, but the flick is short on style and long on nonsense.  Style-wise, DePalma looked to out-Noir ""LA Confidential"", but his touches just come off as a Noir parody, with all the expected gags: the hero cops are both morally suspect, and even Bleichert dangles the possibility that he might conceal evidence against Swank's character once the two of them hop in the sack; Swank's over-the-top performance as a spoiled and sexually ambiguous heiress is built around an impression of Katherine Hepburn (if Hepburn had played ""The Philadelphia Story"" with a potty-mouth, Swanks performance would have been dead-on); last-minute, implausible confessions will solve everything.

The least believable thing about ""The Black Dahlia"" is that despite this being fiction (which would have given the script a free reign to shock us) and also that Brian DePalma is at the helm, this is an incredibly boring movie, lacking any suspense and short on surprises.  There is only a single sequence that does the legend justice - when Bleichert discovers the scene of the crime: the pacing and lighting are so perfectly paced that the story comes closest to realizing the dark dread that the rest of the story has been insulating us from.",1180224000,,3160,5.063583815028902

Poor, talented Fiona Shaw and the usually capable Scarlett Johansson will survive the wreck -- but please, can't we put Josh Harnett out of his (and our) misery?

1582839,2,B00005JP96,"Rarely indeed do so many movie stars (and an acclaimed director) come together to make a movie as atrociously bad as The Black Dahlia.  As if Elizabeth Short didn't suffer enough in life and death, now Hollywood comes along and exploits her memory as a hook to draw viewers in to a laughably awful film that, on its own, doesn't even have a single led to stand on.  The film tries to project itself as some kind of modern-day film noir - it fails miserably.

I always thought Scarlett Johansson was a talented actress, but seeing her really weak performance in this putrid film on the heels of her deer-in-the-headlights acting in A Good Woman, I'm definitely rethinking that opinion.  One thing is for sure: Johansson does not do well in films set in pre-modern times and places.  Then you have the team of Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett, Fire and Ice as they're labeled in the story: the fiery Eckhart throwing crazy fits one after the other while Hartnett struggles to let any hint of emotion (or life) make it past his wooden faade - especially during his big romantic scene with Johansson (it may well be the most unromantic romantic scene I've ever seen).  Hillary Swank, to her credit, wasn't bad at all in her role, but unfortunately for her that role was wrapped up so tightly in the film's ludicrous plot that her performance is tainted by association.  As for Fiona Shaw, I certainly wouldn't want to be the one trying to pick up the pieces of her career after her climactic speech toward the end - that scene sets the young twenty-first century standard for laughably ridiculous, deeply embarrassing acting.  Thank the cinematic gods for the always-alluring and charismatic Mia Kirshner, though, as she is the only thing this movie has going for it.  Playing the role of the ill-fated Elizabeth Short, we only get to see her in screen tests and part of a stag film, but she is mesmerizing.

I'm not even going to talk about the plot because it's just hopelessly convoluted and patently ridiculous.  Apparently realizing the whole premise of the story made no sense, the writers kept adding dead ends, stairs to nowhere, and further oddities in the same vein as Sarah Winchester continuing construction on the Winchester Mystery House.  You try to stay with the story for the first hour or so, but by the 90-minute mark I for one gave up completely.  It was like different writers just kept throwing their own scenes in to the mix, with no knowledge of what happened before or after those moments.

Finally, I couldn't help but notice how unusually small all of the end credits were.  Obviously, just about everyone connected to this film knew how bad the movie was and didn't want their names associated with it.  I know I wouldn't.",1177718400,3,2745,4.6875

The setting is Hollywood right after the end of WWII and a series of murders has two boxers-turned-cops looking for clues to solve the mystery.  Things, however, are not what they seem in the City of Angels...

Josh Hartnett, Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson, Mia Kirshner, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.

In short, the acting, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all very good, while the plot would have been great if it wasn't so darn confusing.

What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh.

Things look pretty on screen but the story will probably leave you with more questions than answers.

Story:

In 1947, Los Angeles was shocked by the gruesome murder of a young actress Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner). She was found naked and sadistically mutilated. The event sparks a manhunt to find the murderer. For the investigation, we have the police officers Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). As partners, they work together, but things are not always what they seem. Little by little, they find strange truths about themselves and the case they are working on.

Review:

Apparently the story looks straight forward, but this is not the case. This is a Brian De Palma movie and he has to use his flashback/slow- mo/melodrama style that actually does more bad than good. ""The Black Dahlia"" is full of subplots which creates confusion and chaos. We are being bombarded with names and flashbacks--especially at the end--that are supposed to help you understand the events in front of you. It makes you wonder why De Palma cannot focus on the main story instead of showing love triangles, another police case, Lee's dark secrets and a boxing match. Also, the very little humor in Dahlia feels forced. The film gives you an alternate conclusion of the murder case, but by the time you get there, you will be wondering how all the events are connected. If you watch the film, question marks will haunt you after you leave the theater. Without giving too many spoilers, I wonder how the investigators didn't notice things that were so obvious. The evidence is for all to see.

In the technical department, ""The Black Dahlia"" provides plenty of goodies. The cinematography and costume design are superb. There is a post-World War II look and feel to it that gives the audience plenty of eye candy. The sound is vivid and well mixed. We get a good but extensive cast, above average acting, but no Oscar. At first I thought that Josh Hartnett was way too lightweight to handle the main role, but he carried the water quite nicely. His acting career is growing and I must say this is his best performance to date. The editing is perfectly crafted to fulfill De Palma's visions and storytelling style, but this is what makes the film difficult to follow.

The Verdict:

""The Black Dahlia"" gives us decent performances and lots of visuals, but the plot--and subplots--are what make the movie difficult to follow and understand.",1174435200,,2778,4.8604651162790695

Adapted from James Ellroy's book of the same name, this Brian DePalma film misses the mark because of poor editing, a muddled plot resolution, and average acting. Four characters are at the forefront of the film; their relationship with each other and the murder never fully engaged this viewer. The ""Fire"" and ""Ice"" detective characters played by Aaron Eckhart and Josh Harnett are emotionally connected to Kay (Scarlett Johansson).  We never know if Kay is in love with either, even though Kay is Lee's (Eckhart's) girlfriend.  While both detectives want to solve the murder, Lee is consumed with finding the murderer.  DePalma never really explains Lee's infatuation with the murdered girl or why he is so intent in solving the mysterious case.  Bucky (Harnett) becomes equally intrigued with the case after he meets Madeleine (Hilary Swank).  What never materializes is a flow of events that relate these characters to the murder and why the murder was committed in the first place.  The real Black Dahlia case was never solved.  DePalma gives us the why, who, where, how, and when, but never enough to make sense of it all.  For instance the scene in which Bucky (Harnett) is reading a newspaper in the park and sees a girl in a short sailor's outfit eating an ice cream cone.  Why did she begin to run?  Did she realize that Bucky recognized her from the lesbian film she had made?  Why did she lie about where the film was made when under interrogation?  Why is Lee involved with a crime boss? How did Lee acquire the money that he had hidden away? Why is Madeleine ""dressing"" like the Black Dahlia? Does she want to lead detective Bucky to her demented mother and perverse father? Is there an incestuous relationship between Madeleine and her father? The roles of Madeleine's father and mother in the murder are never fully explored. The clown smile, lesbianism, Mack Sennett, housing projects? How does this relate to the murder of the Black Dahlia? I won't go into more detail for those who haven't seen the film.  The best feature of the DVD was the interview with James Ellroy.  His own fears, emotions, and interest in crime dramas, Los Angeles, and post WWII melodrama are revealed in a personal interview.  Ellroy is extremely articulate.  His voice and revelations about noir, his own mother's murder, and LA crime are emotionally connected.

She returned to Southern California in July 1946 to see an old boyfriend she knew in Florida. She lived in at least a dozen homes during those six months. She was last seen on January 9, 1947 and had been missing until they found her body January 15, 1947. Laying in an empty lot at the 3800 block of S. Norton Avenue, Los Angeles, her nude body mutilated, cut in half at the waist separated apart, blood drained and body washed, slashed breasts, cigarette burns, bashed head, mouth cut, deep triangular gouge in her thigh to remove a rose tatto she had. Rope burns on wrists. She was tortured.
There were 22 District Attorney suspects investigated. Hundreds of people interviewed. The case is still unsolved.
  If the killer or killers are still alive, he or she would be a very old person now.
  Brian DePalma (Body Double) along with writer James Ellroy and Universal Pictures offer their version of The Black Dahlia murder mystery.
  DVD has option of English, Spanish, French and English, Spanish, French subtitles. 3 featurettes.
  In the Kenneth Anger book, ""Hollywood Babylon II"", are 3 pages of the real, very graphic, close-up photographs of Elizabeth Short's mutilated body at the crime scene.
  In the film, all of the murder photographs have been remade fake by the studio, expect for one photograph that Josh Hartnett looks through. One autopsy photograph of the real Elizabeth Short is real.

1582922,1,B00005JP96,"With 150 reviews of this to date, it seems like overkill to add much more so I will be brief.  Sometimes there is a tendency to hear the overwhelmingly negative consensus about an artistic project that one has hopes for and to start to imagine that somehow everyone has missed the boat, that somehow, there is a misunderstood gem that you will save and rediscover where everyone else is fixated on the wrong things.

I am writing to assure you that this is not the case with the Black Dahlia. The emphasis in storyline is all wrong, the casting is puzzling and the acting similarly confused, the direction is not very inspired, and everything is all a bit too tired: rather than feeling classic, this movie feels rehashed, derivative, and just dull. There are a few visual moments here or there to savor and a few flashes of the darker side of the man who gave you Dressed to Kill, but then I think it would be hard for Brian de Palma to film over two hours and not produce some fleeting moments of eye candy or interest.

A major disappointment in truth and I really truly hoped everybody was wrong on this one, but they weren't.",1173571200,24,1130,4.449275362318841
1582923,2,B00005JP96,"Brian DePalma has crafted a film that is all style with very little substance. The Black Dahlia murder was one of the great unsolved mysteries and this film does little to shed any light on those events of 1947. Based on James Ellroy's novel of the same name the film follws the exploits of two Los Angeles policeman who are drawn into the investigation of the murder.

This sounds like an interesting premise but what the viewer gets is an overly complicated (unintelligible) story line that involves corrupt cops an bizarre love triangle and a murky bisexual look a like of the dead girl from one of the strangest Hollywood families you will ever witness.

The film as mentioned above looks great the Oscar nod for its photography was on the mark. The set design is also fantastic but the praise stops there. The acting by both Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart is wooden. Scarlett Johansson who seems to be near perfect in everything she does is horrible here as the love interest of both leads. And Hilary Swank gives a wierd performance as the bisexual look a like of the murder victim.

If you were looking for greatness from DePalma look elsewhere.",1173571200,,1153,4.669950738916256
1582924,2,B00005JP96,"We had heard all the criticism of this film, but being lovers of 1930-1940 era stories, we decided to give it our own try.

During the first 30 minutes, we were saying to ourselves.... ""Hey this is really good, what is all the criticism about ?""

BUT........ then it hit..... at the 31 minute mark the film hit a brick wall, fell apart and became a burden of chaotic boredom to watch.

At 88 minutes we finally gave up and hit EJECT !

Summary..  Excellent 40's era sets and costumes.... a great moody atmosphere.

Weakness = story, pacing, character development.",1173484800,2,563,4.58
1582925,2,B00005JP96,"In the interest of full disclosure, I have never been a Brian DePalma fan.  I have always considered DePalma to be very much a ""style over substance"" director.  I have also not read Ellroy's novel, so I cannot speak to the faithfulness of the adaptation.  With all of this in mind, this is not a movie which I normally would have seen, but the impassioned advocacy of a few fervent Amazon reviewers persuaded me to ignore the multitudes of people who bashed this movie, and give it a try.

To be fair, it isn't as bad a movie as some have said, but it can see bad from where it's standing.  Also, the point that this is a roughly 3-hour movie edited down to 2 hours is a point well taken, but I would point out that DePalma surely must have known that there was no way he could get the studio's blessing for a 3-hour movie & should have proceeded accordingly.

Nonetheless, one has to take the movie as it is, not for what it could have been.  As it is, there seem to be a nearly infinite number of plot lines, which meander around in search of a sustained narrative for 100 minutes, only to be frantically resolved by a series of monologues in the last 20 minutes...ie, ""This is what I did, this is how I did it, and this is why I did it,"" repeated several times during the race to the finish.  The monologues are only slightly less goofy than most of the dialogue that is found throughout the movie.  Many of these characters seem to have a penchant for repeating themselves.  ""How could this happen?  How could this happen?""

Some of this might have been improved with better casting.  Aaron Eckhart's twitchy antics grow tiresome quickly and almost seem to border on caricature.  Josh Hartnett seems so impossibly bland that one has to wonder how he could possibly have made his character even remotely compelling.  As it is, he makes Bucky Bleichert dull & uninteresting, to the point that I really didn't care what happened to him towards the end.  Scarlett Johansson & Hilary Swank are adequate, but Johansson (whom I normally like) seemed uncomfortable in this role.  Other performances (in particular that of Fiona Shaw's) simply seemed cartoonish.

Looming over all of this is Brian DePalma's determination to show us how great he is with the use of shadows, camera angles and the like, but he simply beats the viewer over the head with it.  Some people may not get the comparison, but it reminds me of how Leonard Bernstein used to conduct Mahler...it always seemed to be more about Lennie than about the music, and he was always trying to make the point of what a great Mahler interpreter he was rather than letting the music simply speak for itself.  So it is with this movie, where it almost seems as though DePalma is leaning over your shoulder, saying ""OK, look at how I use the lighting and the backdrop here,"" and ""Look at how I rotate the camera 180 degrees to create this transitional moment.""  He is so preoccupied with making this movie as ""noirish"" as can be, that he forgot to make it sure that it was at least coherent.

As I said earlier, not as bad as some might describe, but definitely not good at all.  I should have listened to the nay-saying multitudes after all.",1173312000,,3195,4.499133448873484
1582926,1,B00005JP96,"Elroy's first entry in the L.A. Quartet books (along with L.A. Confidential, etc.) is a crime fiction classic.  Brian DePalma's incoherent attempt at bringing it to the screen, sadly less so.  Hartnett's Spock-like delivery, Johansson's oddly detached line-readings and Eckhart's minor role combine into a perfect storm of bland movie-making.  Hilary Swank, however, comes across as strangely appealing and Mia Kirshner affects a palpable sadness and desperation. Unfortunately, these could not rescue this film; I could conceivably eat some Alphabits cereal and poo out a better and more logical script.",1173225600,4,604,5.688888888888889

At first I wanted to blame the screen play writer but the more I considered this, I think it is very possible that the film editor should be shot.  Everyone involved with this movie probably is embarrassed by their affiliation, if they aren't, they should be!

We are never told why the deceased was referred to Black Dahlia, important point since they keep calling her that.  We never identify with her life or the loss of it.  Additionally, I have watched the A&E investigation that was more interesting.

I wondered why the two police officers and the woman they both love are the focus of the movie, after all don't we want to solve a crime?

The unfocused choppiness of the movie reminded me of someone telling a story while under the influence of heavy narcotics.  It was vague in some areas while other non-related issues were addressed with fervor.

I kept hoping it would get better but it never happened.

1582928,1,B00005JP96,"I can only echo what so many previous reviewers have noted. This film has very little to do with the Black Dahlia murder case. I have not read the book, so i don't know if it is as badly structured as the film or not, but the movie is an unstructured mess. About halfway into the film, the murder occurs. Then, it is virtually forgotten, while we wade through a morass of overcomplicated double-crossing and double dealing (not that there's anything boring about corruption, it's just impossible to keep track of who's outwitting who). Then, apparently the director remembers the point of the movie, and the solution to the mystery is presented in whiplash fashion in the last twelve minutes of the movie. Needless to say, the solution is complicated too, so the viewer really needs more time to process it in order to understand it. But maybe that's the point: if we had enough time, we might notice the holes in the plot, or how much the solution is attained by some pretty wild coincidences. The movie has some pretty weird dialogue ("" I don't get modern art"", ""I bet it doesn't get you either""), and since the characters are not well drawn, they appear to have no motivation for their actions (how many times does Bucky switch affections from Kay to Madeleine?; seems to be at least five times). At the end of the movie, I predicted that thanks to the campy nature of the movie, it may become one of those cult films ""so-bad-it's-good"".

If you have read the book you will notice that it is done okay, but there are some parts missing.  The parts missing set up a lot more of the story from the victim and her background.  This movie just jumps into a storm of chaos and I did not like that part.  Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Bucky was so-so.  I did think that the girl from Million dollar baby was okay.  They did not do a good job with some of the timeline when they were involving Lee's nemesis.

1582943,4,B00005JP96,"Almost every film I see, I know everything about it before I see it. I know what it's about, I know who is in it, and I know what critics and audiences think of it. I saw ""The Black Dahlia"" in the theatre the day it came out and enjoyed it. Then I began reading the reviews for it and I was like ""what the hell?"" Nobody likes this movie, for various reasons. It's not as good as the book, it tries to be a film-noir and fails, the acting is bad, and, my favorite reason for hating it, Scarlett Johansson is in it. I've seen the movie three times now...This last time after reading the book and, yes, granted the book is a lot better. This film is not half as bad as it's made out to be though. First off, yes it's not just trying to pay homage to film-noir. It's trying to be a film-noir and it's not. The acting isn't bad, but some of it is campy. And Scarlett Johansson is a very talented and very hot actress. First off, the dialogue in the film is pretty close to the dialogue in the book. It worked very well in the book, but has its ups-and-downs in the movie for several reasons. No one in the movie truly seems comfortable with the dialogue. It's 40s-esque dialogue and you got people who have been in movies like Erin Brockovich, Lost in Translation, and Dumb & Dumber reciting it. The story is one of two films released in 2006 that are fictional stories built on the foundation of a true-life crime story (the other being ""Hollywoodland"" a superior film). Josh Hartnett plays Dwight

""Bucky"" Bleichert, a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Ice. Aaron Eckhart plays Lee Blanchard, also a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Fire. To get a proposition passed and score a spot in the Warrants division, Blanchard and Bleichert duke it out and become local celebrities. Soon, they're both working Warrants and find themselves partners. Soon, their duo becomes a trio when Kay Lake (Johansson), Blanchard's girlfriend comes into the mix. But then their lives change forever when a mutilated corpse is found in a vacant lot. The corpse is of a woman, who has been cut in half at the waist, disemboweled, and has had a grisly smile carved onto her face ear-to-ear. The body is Elizabeth Short, dubbed ""The Black Dahlia"" because of her tendency to wear all black. This is an unsolved murder that really occurred, but almost everything in the movie involving her murder is fictitious. The woman's murder sets Blanchard off and causes him to alienate his friends and family while he obsessively searches for her killer. Bleichert, meanwhile, does his own investigation which leads him to meet Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), the daughter of a rich construction tycoon who bares a remarkable resemblance to The Dahlia. The last 20 minutes of the film weren't handled very well. Many of these scenes are creepy and well filmed, while others are campy. Especially the long-winded monologue delivered by Madeleine's mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw). The acting is really the weak point of the film, but not all of it is bad. Hartnett, Johansson, and Eckhart aren't terrible. Oddly enough, the weakest link is two-time Oscar winner Swank, who looks good for the part but gives a weak performance. Listen closely (maybe not too closely) and you'll hear her trying on a rich-uppity kind of accent. Then you'll hear that accent fade and then suddenly return. In the book, it mentions the character tries to sound like The Black Dahlia (which would be a Boston accent). But what Swank is doing is not a Boston accent. Was it supposed to be? Whatever...The movie scored an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, which I think it deserves. It does catch the atmosphere James Ellroy had in his novel pretty well, but it just doesn't roll with it as far as plot. You have to realize, also, how far the movie differed from the book. It took over a hundred pages before they find the body of Elizabeth Short. In the movie, it takes twenty minutes. The movie is good though and I'm surprised so many people hate it. I think if you were to walk into it with an open mind and no preconceived notion (like I did), you'll enjoy it. It's certainly better than two stars...There's people on Amazon who like ""Date Movie"" more than this. I think this movie is a lot better than some more acclaimed Brian De Palma films. Even if you didn't like this film the first time, I beg you to give it another chance.

In addition to a murky script the casting is so strange that the viewer is left wonder why should anyone care?

When a historical event is choosen for the basis of s script the writer and director have the obligation to make a film that at least partially partains to the event. In this case no one rose to the challenge.

There are so many fascinating twists to the Black Dahalia case that even a novice could make a good film about the killing. Was Elizabeth Short a hermaphrodite and thus incapable of consumating the numerous affairs she is alleged to have had? Was Elizabeth Short blackmailing some prominient man and he turned on her and savagely slaughtered her in revenge? Was the killer of Elizabeth Short a sexual sadist with a string of bodies to his credit or was he the father of a neglected son who later turned the old man over to the police, after the father's death of course?

Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head, is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear?

The case remains unsolved, and spawned multiple books, one of which is the basis for this movie.  The movie itself uses the murder and the ensuing investigation to explore multiple facets of LA society at that time; a corrupt LAPD, the criminal underworld, the rich and famous, the ultra-rich and secretive, and the various women who migrated to LA hoping for stardom but ending up with less admirable fates.  Several themes from the real life case show up in this movie as sub-themes that control events.  These include the power of the press and the hidden but common intersections between police officers and criminals.  The plot of the movie is quite intricate, and offers many twists and turns that are totally unexpected.  All the main characters are portrayed as corruptible or corrupted, and personal loyalties are often abused, if not outright betrayed.  Unlike real life, the murder is solved here, and nobody could have possibly guessed who it was until the murderer reveals him/her self.

This movie is set to look and feel like LA Confidential, with the gorgeous babes and everyone smoking, but does not come across quite the same.  First and foremost, the violence here occurs in many forms, while it was mainly gun play in LA Confidential.  Second, the girls are really wicked here.  Third, no one seems to really know what everyone else is up to.  DVD's now come with special features as a given.  For this DVD, I was hoping for an  in-depth comparison between the movie, the book it was based on, and actual events.

The story even makes up a fake confession, that made me feel like I was watching an SNL skit got awry.  I had much trouble following it, mainly because everyone's speech was so unclear, and there was so much in the movie that was completely pointless.  The constant background music tried too hard, and got on my nerves.

I think it is true that Elizabeth Short had a questionable social life, but to portray her as doing lesbian porn against her will, and prostituting herself, is very disrespectful towards a real woman, who really was murdered, and who undoubtedly still has relatives who are alive and well.

With strong actresses like these, they could have achieved something. Instead, Kay was a homemaker who sat at home helplessly waiting for bad news. Madeleine seemed to have nothing else to do but plot evil. To make it worse, they threw themselves at Bucky (Josh Hartnett) for no apparent reasons.

Perhaps, like me, they were seduced by the mystery and intrigue of the real case of the Black Dahlia.  Unfortunately, no one told these great actors that the best part of their being in this movie was the hairstyles.  I wish someone had told me.

It seems unlikely that a historical event with so much intrigue and drama could be made so incredibly boring.  From the start, the film gave the old college try at using the classic film noir style.  Unfortunately, Josh Hartnett's voice overs sound as though he has a mouth full of marbles. Apparently he mistook mumbling for brooding intensity. Aaron Eckhart, Hartnett's partner in the film, has wild mood swings which are not explained until much later in the film-- and not very well even then.  Johansson and Swank are very shiny plastic Barbie dolls with overly-rehearsed voices that they must have been directed to use.

An hour into the film, I was very confused.  Is this a film about a love triangle?  About boxing?  The zoot suit riots?  Is it a cop drama?  Is it about cigarettes, for Pete's sake?  Around that time, I took a break to fold laundry, without pausing the film.  When I returned twenty minutes later, I asked my husband what I missed.  He replied, ""I'm not sure.  I don't think you missed anything.""  If you don't see this film, that's what you'll be missing: nothing.

1582992,4,B00005JP96,"I've only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks, talks, sounds, and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking, dark, very clever, and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative, overplayed, smoldering, overwhelming, cheesy, campy Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller (my favorite genres) with the evident elements of black comedy (the most favorite genre when it's done well). I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching, especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might've missed the first time. 'The Black Dahlia' is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie; I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light, shadows, his combination of colors, black and gold - my favorite, his use of stairways, and the way we first are allowed to notice the body - it is Art, noir film made by an Artist. Besides, I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter `s song ""Love for Sale"" which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.

The movie grabbed me with its visual grandeur, heated atmosphere of danger, dark, desperate mood and that's why I like it so much. I don't like it for its story - after all, it is one of the myriads of versions of what had actually happened 60 years ago, I don't admire it for the acting, even though, Mia Krishner as unfortunate Betty Short was heartbreaking and I did like Hillary Swank for the first time in my life (yes, I know that she is two times Oscar winner but I liked her here, when she said to herself, ""Bucky...I'll try to remember... that"" - it was a good acting, irony which I've never seen in her before.) I also believe that Fiona Shaw was wonderful in her role - it simply could not be played any differently and to make her character so over the top was an artistic achievement and not the lack of acting abilities as many viewers seem to believe.

I respect the movies that entertain me, excite me, and stay with me even if I see their weakness very well. ""Black Dahlia"" is one of these movies. I am perhaps one of very few viewers in the whole world who actually was satisfied with the ending and the big revelation before it. Yes, it is bizarre, and it is grotesque, but it fits the whole movie perfectly and when I mentioned earlier how clever the movie was, I meant, how well its creators explored just one of the evidences and using the works of literature, art, and earlier cinema, built the whole possible story behind the murder based on it. Once again, ""The Black Dahlia"" is IMO one of the best and most entertaining movies of last year which I enjoyed enormously.

The sexual tension is high, even while the body count is piling up. Two detectives who once moonlighted as boxers become obsessed with the brutal murder of a young woman aspiring to be an actress. The two men are desperate to find the reason for this senseless death, so much so that they let other brutal murders happening in the city take a back seat. Their search for the young brunette's killer leads them through a web of lies and to the doorstep of a filthy business conducted behind closed doors, yet right under the noses of those who should've figured it out but let emotions get in the way. The script is organized and pulls together well, tying up all the loose ends the way this type of movie should.

1583039,5,B00005JP96,"In the late 1970s, I began to go to the movies. I saw Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"", and it made me want to be a hobbit ; I saw ""Escape from New York"", and it made me want to be Snake Plissken. But when I saw ""Dressed to Kill"", at 14, it made me want to be Brian De Palma. To the despair of my parents, I no longer had any ambitions of becoming a great scientist : I was set on directing. De Palma had made me fall in love with the movies as an artform.

Almost thirty years later, I can proudly say I have been faithful to the man who ignited this passion, though I am not sure his films have made me a better man. I have seen virtually all of his works on the big screen, including earlier ones like ""Carrie"" and ""Phantom of the Paradise"". His 1984 film ""Body Double"" was a life-changing experience, and I was to see it a total of twelve times, although I am not too happy with the influence it has had on me. My only infidelities to the master were walking out of the theater the second time I saw ""Scarface"" (but I now realize I walked out on Oliver Stone, not on him)... and missing the theatrical release of ""The Black Dahlia"" because of house robbers and Guillermo del Toro.

""The Black Dahlia"" is a story David Lynch (that other favorite of mine) had long wanted to direct. But of course, in the hands of De Palma, you could not expect the same kind of treatment. In fact, Lynch has probably already made his Black Dahlia, calling it ""Twin Peaks"". So you could almost make a comparison.

De Palma has of course chosen the operatic, glamourous, film-noir approach, in what seems to be a recapitulation of his whole career, from the unexpected reappearance of ""Phantom of the Paradise""'s William Finley (in a role reminiscent of ""Blow Out""'s killer), to the cameo by ""Body Double""'s Gregg Henry, the homage to Dario Argento (who had also inspired a scene in ""The Mark of Cain""), the penultimate shock scene (as in ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed to Kill""), the street violence a la ""Scarface"", the psychotic killer reminiscent of his early carrier, the wonderful reconstruction of a bygone era (a la ""The Untouchables""), etc. ""The Black Dahlia"" seems to connect all of De Palma's movies into a coherent whole, a single consistent universe.

As a De Palma lover, I was particularly proud to see that much of what I liked most about the film came from him. The discovery of the body is a piece of genius, perhaps the most affecting scene of the film, which connects to similar statements in ""Scarface"" or ""Blow Out"" that tragedy often strikes in the background, on the sides, where no one watches or hears. One of De Palma's main themes has always been powerlessness, usually the powerlessness of a male to save a female victim. Never perhaps has he been as effective as here. Also brilliant is the way he chooses to show the body, or not to show it, almost like Ridley Scott with his Alien.

My only regrets about the film are first that the victim (Elizabeth Short)'s psychology is a little too naive and romantic. Lynch did a better job in ""Twin Peaks"" (and his daughter in ""The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer"") showing a victim who was drawn to evil, who was a fallen human just like you and me with a penchant for the dark side, and who descended headlong into vice and corruption. De Palma and his screenwriter on the contrary turn Short into an innocent victim of the system, a pure little girl who is abused an destroyed by an evil world, which does not seem to cohere with her promiscuity (though of course, the fact that Ellroy has projected his own mother onto the victim explains why she has become such a spotless figure.)

Second, I think the stag films looked fake. In ""Forgotten Silver"", Peter Jackson did a much better job recreating the look and feel of movies of an earlier era, and he certainly had less money and talent in those days than De Palma now has. I wish De Palma had achieved that feeling of suddenly peeling off the beautifying hollywood layer which he had created with Gary Sinise at the end of ""Snake Eyes"".

Third, but this has little to do with the director's art per se, I just wish he had chosen better suited and more attractive actresses. Mia Kirshner (one of 24's sexy terrorists) is really pretty, and though she must have been confused by her character's inconsistent and unconvincing psychology, she does a good job being the kind of Vivian Leigh of the gutter she is asked to be. But Scarlett Johansson, at 22, is too young for the role (this is not ""Bugsy Malone""), and seems to be overdoing it with her retro-posturing. A more mature and naturally glamourous actress (think Charlize Theron) would have given more depth and authenticity to the character. As for Hilary Swank, to be tactful, she is not exactly my idea of a femme fatale.

One last problem I have with the film has to do with De Palma's comments on the real-life murder. He seems to be baffled by what the murderer did to his or her victim, by how he could have turned such a beautiful girl into such a macabre ""sculpture"", as he calls it himself. But consider De Palma's career. He has crucified and pierced Piper Laurie with dozens of knives ; slit his wife Nancy Allen's throat twice ; lacerated Angie Dickinson with a razor ; eviscerated Deborah Shelton with a power drill ; and one of his current projects is about a madman who savagely lobotomizes women. Now he is pretending that he has not a clue what the murder was about ?

My own take on it is that the murderer was a Brian De Palma without a camera and a make up crew, someone who did it for real. And in fact, this is about the kind of answer you will get in the film itself. ""The Black Dahlia"" definitely shows an uneasiness about the film-making business and its impact on people, perhaps revealing the second thoughts he is having about his recurring choices of subject and the effect his films may have had on their audience (think of the cult status ""Scarface"" has achieved among the gangsta rap crowd.) As someone who has been scarred for life by the violence of his films, I can perfectly understand how he must feel, though I wish he had been more open about it.",1170460800,4,6139,4.435283687943262

Such a shame as it is probably the most beautifuly photographed film of the year.. the interiors, the lighting and shadows just scream with beauty.. the acting, surprisingly is pretty good too..

The dialogue was very difficult to hear, we kept having to put the volume all the way up.

Scarlett Johansson was almost likeable, but looked horrible and almost unattractive. She looked as if she were ill and didn't fit the part at all.

Everything the other reviewers have written is absolutely true.  The acting is bad, the script is too confusing, and Brian De Palma has probably made the worse film of his career.

If it had focused on the ""Black Dahlia"" murder case, rather than using it as a prop, and had employed some talented middle-aged actors to play the lead characters, this movie would've been far more interesting and might have succeeded as a classic film noir.

My hopes for this movie were high. I love murder mysteries, fiction or non-fiction. What better murder case to do a movie about then the BLACK DAHLIA? This is one of the most notorious and high profile yet to be solved murders in history. The suspects. The crime scene. The girl. The whys. Who was she? Why was she there and how did she end up neatly and surgically severed in half on the side of the road?

Well, if you watch this movie, you'll still be wondering because Elizabeth Short i.e. THE BLACK DAHLIA, is a SIDE STORY! That's right. There is so little time spent on the murder mystery and the evidence of the crime that my wife and I joked, ""no wonder the crime has never been solved.""

I'm not sure of the exact time, but it was at least 40 minutes into the film before they even found the body.

In short, the movie should not have been called THE BLACK DAHLIA. The Black Dahlia is just a ploy to get you into the theatre in order to watch a movie about two ex-boxers and friends who are in love with the same girl and smoke a lot of cigarettes.

This was a hugely disappointing and boring waste of a potentially great premise for a film.

I'm a fan of James Elroy, but in the special features he says that he's paying homage to Elizabeth Short with this film. I think they call it CAPITALIZING, because that's what this is. It doesn't explore the murder at all. It doesn't explore the whys. We don't even get to know who Elizabeth Short was.

So how, how HOW did it go wrong? Instead of the real-life murder thriller of the year, ""The Black Dahlia"" ended up being a turgid, incomprehensible mess that flops madly around like an epileptic fish. ""LA Confidential,"" this ain't -- it's more of a flaccid stagger into the real-life story of a gruesome murder, without much to make us care what happens.

Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are boxer/cops, and are on a stakeout when the dismembered, disfigured body of a young woman is found -- blood drained, chopped in half, and mutilated all over. The public becomes increasingly obsessed with who killed the starlet, nicknamed the ""Black Dahlia.""

So Bucky and Lee start investigating who killed the Black Dahlia, prowling through lesbian bars and learning the seedy details of what happened to the girl, with tragic results for the partners. Who killed the Black Dahlia, and why? The answers are even more shocking.

And boring. ""The Black Dahlia"" is crammed with stuff to titillate and shock -- stag films, incest, lesbian pairings (for a pretty silly reason, actually), and Scarlett Johansson in 1940s lingerie. But it ends up doing the exact reverse -- it stupefies. Like a beautiful painting, it doesn't actually move or show anything really happening -- it just sits there, looking pretty.

The first half is a pretty ordinary murder thriller, a la ""L.A. Confidential"" -- it's all very glitzy and grimy, and fairly easy to understand. Serial killer, pretty girl killed gruesomely, and two cops out to find out whodunnit. Right, that's fine. But when the guys start prowling through lesbian bars, the plot ties itself into a snarly knot, and gets more and more incomprehensible as Harnett rattles through the staggery storylines.

Admittedly Brian De Palma juices this up with beautiful vintage costumes, sets and other stunning visuals. But by the ending, nothing makes sense -- and along the way, we have to deal with tepid subplots like the boxing (what?) and Bucky gallantly rejecting Lee's girlfriend's advances. It only complicates an incomprehensible plot, with turgid, forgettable dialogue ("" I don't get modern art."" ""I doubt modern art gets you, either"" -- what?).

Harnett looks wooden and confused, as if he's just been told to ""play it like Bogart"" and he has no idea who that is. Eckhart tries his best, and he's an excellent actor even in a bad movie -- but Lee is a character with no logical thought processes, and Johansson basically is there to look busty and have sex with Harnett.

Every frame of this film is dripped in such beautiful film noir, that it makes the viewer feel as if they are in the 40's, or at least watching a film from that era. And, the reason for the 'over-the-top' acting, as it's been written, is for the same reason, to capture what is was REALLY like in L.A. in the 1940's. And, of coarse, there's the complaint about Aaron Eckhart overacting...well, didn't ANYONE hear that he was hyped up on benzadrine (the character, not the actor), which would have that effect? And, it's ALL abouth the dahlia once her body is discovered, unlike some idiotic reviews would have you believe, just not in the way that falls under 'conventional'. It's about how the 2 cops become obssessed with the dahlia and solving the case, putting other cases aside, like Raymond ""Junior"" Nash, a child molester and murderer, and Bobby Dewitt (whose initials are cut into Kay's back, B.D....could that also be for Brian DePalma?), a lowlife bankrobber and pimp that Blanchard had put away, but will soon be getting released, and Blanchard can't risk Dewitt being on the loose. In the meantime, Bucky becomes obssessed with Madeline Linscott, a dahlia-type wanna be, femme fatale. (One of the many great lines in the movie come from her: ""Oh, what's your name?"" she asks Bucky. ""Bucky,"" he replies. ""Bucky? I'll try to remember,"" she responds in a terrific salute to Hepburn and Bacall. It's all in the facial expression as she speaks, full of sarcasm.) And, that goes for the rest of the cast. Everyone in this film is dynamite, whether it be in some of the lead roles by Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart, Scarlett Johansson, Hillary Swank, or Mia Kirschner; or some of the minor roles played by Kevin Dunn, Gregg Henry, and (last but NOT least) the always great William Finley. And as for the criticism of Fiona Shaw, well, shame on you all, for she brings down the house with her BRILLIANT performance of Ramona Linscott!! Her performance is equal to that of Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"". Kudos to you Fiona for that awesome homage! Then there's the brilliant way the 'screen test' films are shot and incorporated into the film to serve as both character and plot development is reason enough to praise this film AND DePalma! And, it was TOO cool that Brian dubbed his own voice as the director of the 'screen test' films! (Where is a Pauline Kael in this day and age, because we really need one?!) This is a solid homerun for DePalma, and an obvious 'postcard' to all of his fans. This is an explosive descent into Hell, as described by the director, not some 'lightweight' ""L.A. Confidential"". And, the gore is very minimal (surprising since it's such a sinister story), unlike an idiotic grossout episode of ""CSI"", or ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"", which is probably what a lot of reviewers on here were expecting. And, as for the mystery within a mystery within a mystery, kudos to you Brian for pulling off such a difficult, exciting project. This is the kind of movie that only true fans of GOOD, psychological, suspense, mystery thrillers can enjoy; people who like to think as they're watching the film, enjoy being challenged by all the twists and turns, and NOT have to have everything spelled out for them, like some lowrate episode of ""Law & Order"". (You know, dumbed down and spelled out in a simplistic A,B,C's kind of way.) If you want to see a film that is mesmerising in every scene, and something that you'll want to view multible times, then ""The Black Dahlia"" is for you. A great, stylish, sinister movie that will haunt you for sometime after each viewing. For all you other people who need a ""popcorn"" candy style film that simplifies and/or dumbs down everything in the plot just to please the masses, then pass on this one, but leave the reviews up to people who enjoy the art of filmmaking, and appreciate a great film with a great story when they see one. And quit picking on DePalma for giving us such films to treasure! Thank you.

I'm still struggling to figure out why this happened, because there was no reason this couldn't have been incredible. But the best explanation I can give, and the one I gave to friends who asked how it turned out is that it seemed to me like everyone involved really were not that interested in telling the story of the Black Dahlia murder, and that the had to deal with the true facts were seen as an inconveniance. The strange thing is, someone had at least done some of the homework, because there was a scene where Elizabeth Short(excellently played by Mia Kirshner) talks about how she was engaged to a man who died on his way back from the war, and as I watched it I remembered reading about this in a book based on the case. That the could get a detail that was so small is so discouraging when you consider the facts they completely falsified, such as Ms. Short appearing in pornographic films. The case is not given nearly enough focus, the time that should have been spent on the facts of the case were mostly wasted on showing how the fictional characters dealt with the events. All in all, this film should have been great, as it had nothing stopping it from being the film I thought it would be, but those involved apparently thought three fictional characters were more interesting, which begs the question if they aren't interested in the Black Dahlia Murder, why make a film about it?",1167782400,2,1775,4.398176291793313

1583167,2,B00005JP96,"Brian de Palma has never been the most gifted of filmmaker's but he's crafted some pretty good stuff, namely Carrie, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables, but what we have here is a dismal excuse for a movie that considering the incredible source material, falls not only flat on its face but manages to go subterranean.  The Black Dahlia (a.k.a Elizabeth Short) murder is one of the most iconic and fantastic of unsolved murder mysteries of the 20th century and one deeply rooted in the allure and myth of old Hollywood.  This kind of fodder in the right hands could have yielded extraordinary results, but de Palma seems to have no idea not only how handle the material but how to induce the slightest bit of interest in anyone associated with it.  Every single actor seemed not only bored but downright annoyed, with Hilary Swank (a consistently gifted actress) hamming it up in the femme fatale role of socialite, Madeleine Linscott.  The plot is contrived beyond salvation; ideas and themes thrown in at break-neck speed but in the end not amounting to anything.  There's plenty of conjecture but little proof or finality, so, in the end, who cares? Yes, the film is visually appealing and attention to detail is in full evidence, but that's about it.  Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart and Scarlett Johansson just lie as still as swamp water and even the score by the usually reliable Mark Isham fails to create a sense of time and place.  Believe it or not, the best performance was given Mia Kirshner in the role of Betty Short, who, incidentally, has about a total 10 minutes of screen time and all through screen test films.  With minimal time, she manages to not only humanize a very sensational story but to convey the tragedy that struck this young woman 60 some odd years ago.  Those expecting anything similar to L.A. Confidential or any other film noir masterwork (I did, based on the fact that both novels were written by James Ellroy...big mistake) will be disappointed beyond words.

The movie proved once again the generalized maxim, that if the critics hate it--it will be entertaining. Also it reinforces the old cliche, that those who can't, derive solace from deriding the efforts of those who can. This movie is filmed beautifully. The imagery is rich. The portrayals by the actors, stunning. One must interact mentally with this film and allow the images to tweak the emotions.  I can see why so many find fault with this, it takes some  sensitivity and intelligence to  bask in it's numerous strengths. The lack of car chases, long, drawn out, slow-motion gun battles, freely hurled wisecracks, feel-good flitting from scene-to-scene, etcetera--will overheat the minimalist thought capacities of the average viewer. This film does not crudely hammer its elements into the viewers' sloping brow, rather, allows the scenes and relevant detail to unfold; trusting you to react, and feel, and assemble.

Ranging from the amoral police practices of officers Bleichert and Blanchard to the rich, perverse and disgusting Linscott family, the storyline drifts through the seedier bars and nightspots of Los Angeles circa late `40's.

Betty Short was a young woman from a small town who went to Hollywood with dreams of getting into the movies. She was not a prostitute, nor did she act in stag films.  In fact she was unable to have intercourse with men due to a medical condition. She did however live off  many men with nightly dates.  It seems she had a different date almost every other night. One of these men might have been her killer. Or perhaps she got into the wrong car that day in January of 1947,  the last time she was seen alive. No one really knows who killed Betty Short, But it had to have been someone with medical knowledge. De Palma's film is very beautiful cinematically, nice score, and is quite mesmerizing. The charactors are very interesting. Hillary Swank is very kinky and sexy. Of course the film is slow, that's the whole idea of the film, it creates the moody era of 1947 Los Angles.

The film as written by Josh Friedman attempts to follow the novel by James Ellroy, itself a strange riff on the Black Dahlia murder.  What results is an over produced, over directed, under realized recreation of the 1940s complete with slicky costumes and very loud music by (surprisingly!) Mark Isham.

There are so many subplots filled with walk on characters that keeping the story understandable is almost impossible - certainly not worth an attempt to capsulize for a review.  There are some terrific little performances by Fiona Shaw as the druggie mad woman whose role becomes significant only at film's end, Hilary Swank as the copycat Dahlia who dallies in cops and soldiers and lesbians (convincingly so), and Mia Kirshner who presence as the true Black Dahlia is shown only in black and white film clips that indeed focus the unwieldy script while she is on!

Odd to see actors with the credentials of this cast wandering around in la-la land seemingly looking for a script that makes sense.  But it is a pretty period piece to look at despite the lack of reasonable storyline.  Grady Harp, December 06",1167350400,22,1551,4.896946564885496
1583281,3,B00005JP96,"As the film will tell you, Elizabeth Short was a beautiful young woman who went to Hollywood to try to become famous...and wound up becoming infamous as one of the most fascinating unsolved murders Hollywood has ever seen.

This film makes an obvious attempt at a very noir cinematic feeling, but doesn't accomplish it very well. Instead, the plot is convoluted and entirely too complex to follow very easily. The vast majority of the time you are left confused and a little bored. I was very disappointed in this film mainly because it had the opportunity to make an incredible film about this bizarre and morbidly fascinating true life event, but it was so poorly written and executed.

One of the most negative things about this film was the fact that I didn't think it concentrated enough on the actual murder of the Black Dahlia. This movie is more about how her murder was such a motivating and driving force in the lives of two cops assigned to the case. It's about their friendship, and ultimate demise in the aftermath of this brutal murder. I would have liked the film to focus more closely on Elizabeth Short, because it felt too much like she was a peripheral aspect in the movie.

Writing and script aside, I also think this film tried to rely too heavily on it's star power. Unfortunately, Hollywood should know by now that big stars like Scarlett Johannson and Hilary Swank do not necessarily translate into an instant blockbuster. They have to actually be telling a good story.

Elizabeth Short is better known as the Black Dahlia, so named by the newspapers in reference to her resemblance to the film ""Blue Dahlia"", and her tendency to wear black. She was a young woman who moved to California with the same hope that many girls have -- to become a famous movie star. Unfortunately, also like most girls, Elizabeth quickly discovered that becoming a movie star isn't so simple. Unlike the way she is portrayed in the film, many people who knew the real Elizabeth Short did not believe her to be a promiscuous tramp. However, according to interviews, Elizabeth did engage in a practice known as ""dating for dinner"" in which young girls, such as herself, who were struggling and often couldn't afford food, would go out on dates with men simply to get a meal. While it's purely speculation, this practice was probably her downfall in the sense that one of the men she dated was probably her killer.

What fascinated people most about Elizabeth Shorts untimely demise was the manner in which she died. This wasn't the usual homicide. Her body was mutilated and left on display in an area where it would easily be found, which means the killer *wanted* her found. While I won't go into the gruesome details, suffice it to say that the mutilation of her form, and the almost artful way in which her body was arranged is very telling of the psychotic nature of the person who killed her.

Elizabeth's murder remains unsolved to this day, although there is some evidence that strongly suggests the identity of her killer *was* one of the men who was originally on the police's suspect list, the most noteworthy of which was a prominant L.A. doctor with a sadistic and dark nature. However, the film offers it's own theatrical ending/identity of the killer, which should in no way be taken as fact.

While this film probably deserves 2 stars, I gave it 3 stars for effort. However, I expected more from the people who brought us ""L.A. Confidential"", a film that had much better writing, and whose plot wasn't completely incomprehensible, which is more than can be said of ""The Black Dahlia"".",1167264000,5,3601,4.715421303656598

In the end he does pull it all together and packages it up for you. However, this movie meanders and actually avoids the subject of the murder. It became so far from the point that I was actually considering turning it off. But I kept going out of curiosity.

I never even felt like I was watching a movie. This was one of the most boring films noirs ever made. Go see oldies like The Third Man, The Naked City, and The Killing. Those are good classic noir films. For some decent new ones rent, Sin City, LA Confidential, and Muhllond Falls. Kafka is a great one too but it is unavailable at this time.

The Black Dahlia is an awful film with no hook, no direction, no nothing. This is in my bottom 10 list of bad films for the year. Beware.",1167177600,9,1216,4.087866108786611

The storyline here is completely lost in the mess of spinning cameras, POV's and noir that isn't noir at all.

Sure he has Scarface, Carrie, the Untouchables and the successful Mission:Impossible but then again he has Snake Eyes which fell apart after 20 minutes, Mission to Mars and let's not forget the Bonfire of the Vanities. The Black Dahlia's story, setting and mood seem perfect de Palma yet the film feels so lifeless, incoherent and even at times unintentionally funny. The actual murder case was shocking and incredibly disturbing but here it almost seems like the backdrop for the ""real"" issue which is basically nothing interesting.

2  L.A cops, Bleichart and Blanchard, are tracking down a criminal but as they're dealing with it, a grisly discovery is found in the park: a young woman has been cut in half, drained of blood and organs moved with one last touch: her mouth has been extended ear to ear, forming an eerie grin. Elizabeth Short, nicknamed the Black Dahlia by the press, is still one of the most famous unsolved murders in California history so you would think that much attention would be paid to this but instead we focus on a fixation with someone who did a terrible thing to Blanchard's woman Kay while Bleichart gets involved with a Elizabeth look-alike.

On more than one occasion I kept thinking they bring up the case and the woman simply because they realized that they were making a movie called the Black Dahlia so they had to mention the case and show one of the cop's obsession with solving it. It's really a shame since author James Ellroy's other novel, L.A Confidential, was a great film while this just feels a mess from start to finish. Worse still is the acting where normally good actors just seem completely off and almost unsure of the performances. The only one that even comes off as a bit good is Josh Hartnett who has what I call the ""William Hurt syndrome"", named since both actors can be good but their mannerisms or voice suggest they sound bored. The other notable is the L Word's Mia Kirshner, playing Smart in test screening footage and an old movie. That piercing stare she has creates a memorable character that you never even met in the film.

Now there's at least a couple of trademark ""de Palma""-isms throughout the film including an awesome crane shot that starts off the whole Dahlia case and a scene involving the staircase feels vintage for him but the rest of the film suggests either he's totally awful now and even the fact he made Scarface won't save him now, or simply the often used ""the studio made me do it"". Unlike James Cameron's underperforming-but-underrated the Abyss, especially the director's cut, this just feels completely off.

Is this just a rough patch and he'll get better or is he just bad now. Beats me, but this certainly wasn't a strong case that he can still deliver. Too bad.",1167091200,3,2840,4.717741935483871

much less any expectations or delusions...actually, well, one expectation, and only one, and that was the i expected to experience a film; to be entertained...it seems, of late especially, that viewers obstruct their subjective minds with objective issues, such as the actors and their track record, the director and his...etc...

i know all too well, that scenes with films (and even entire movies) can be and are crafted for the simple purpose to showcase an actor(s) aptitude that is ment to shine beyond simply rendering the character...and i will be the first to rip a horrible film, if it is horrible to me, as i did with ""Crash,"" which is one of the genus of films that i mentioned (empty storyline, sheened over with a few roles written to display acting of a high caliber, beyond simply illustrating the plot...).

i might be typing somewhat coherently now, but my mind is hopelessly disjointed and incoherent, and i suppose that is why this film seemed so (as one previous reviewer put it) ""intoxicating""...of course, i knew the dialogue of hartnett's, in parts, was so unabashedly cliche', in the whole private-eye-inner-dialogue, yet, i didn't expect anything more of the film...i didn't expect it to be new, for its precepts to be wholly original, as nothing, especially in the film world, is wholly original, and writing a story a certain way for the sake of trying to achieve profoundess or originality, is stupid and renders the story impernanent and often crippled...yet, all i saw in this was the story, and its darkened hues and rendering, going from the daylight gleam of the first 4th further and frther into black dissolution...the actors flailing and tripping and misfiring, which only seemed to fit the story as it became more and more depraved...

this film was an experience for me, and i have seen many films, only few of which really were an ""expierence""...this film so enticed me...the emtpy theater i saw it in only proppeled me into the story, losing myself in its incoherence...i saw it all, all things you and everyone else get so upset about, and i didn't care, i had no reason to...the film told a story, and scenes, as you say, didn't overstay their welcome...that is one thing that surpised me, and that was that no matter how powerfully a scene was enacted and rendered, or how ""weak"", it left abruptly or right on time, which is better than a scene overstaying, i suppose...the spastic love scenes and the strange, unlikely plot twists only ensnared me more, for some subjective reason...

all i can say is that i think this film is an achievement, the story, the performances of the actors, even despite what you say, were all achievements to my ken...and, best of all, i walked out of this film, my only expectation completely surpassed and fulfilled...film noir? couldn't name any film noir other than black and white films...de palma? what did he do before this? once again, through my nescience of certain conventions of film, i maybe expierenced something very different from what most others here did, and i just felt the need to protect the expierience within this film, and also maybe try to turn a new view upon the perspectives most of you are reviewing and perceiving from...which is sort of fused, as i said previously, with objectively-inspired pre-conceptions on what this film should have been...and not what it was...not seeing characters, but rather seeing only acting and how it wasn't ""this"" or ""that""...i saw a film-a story with characters-and read like a novel...an aproach i usually take to films, and, for whatever reasons, this film was one of the few which gave such good results...

sure, the film might be terrible to your vein of thinking and consideration, but at least try to see it as a singular achievement, and not let pre-conceived notions tell you what the film is or isn't...

1583411,4,B00005JP96,"The movie is based on James Ellroy's novel of the same name, which is based on the real life murder of Elizabeth Short.  But the novel is a work of fiction.  In reality, the murder of Betty Short has remained one of the world's mysteries, never being solved.  In his novel, and so in the movie, a fictional account of events, which include fictional characters, is given to solve the murder case.

The movie follows the story of Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichart, aka Mr. Ice (Josh Hartnett), and Lee Blanchard, aka Mr. Fire (Aaron Eckhart), two members of the L.A. police force who are put on the case of the murder of Elizabeth Short (played by Mira Kirshner), who will become known as the Black Dahlia.  So the movie shows how obsessed they get with the case and how entangled they become in the web of lies, with Bucky becoming involved with a woman (Hilary Swank) who looked exactly like the victim, and who incidentally had an affair with her.  And in between you have Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), who is the love interest of Bucky, but was saved from a criminal by Lee, so a triangle is set up.

I had read the book and after seeing the trailer back in August, I waited for this movie with anticipation.  Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations on some levels.
The first problem comes from the novel itself.  I think it's highly presumptuous to offer a solution to a real murder case that's never been solved using fictional characters.  The result is that there's no air of mystery around the story, you're not left with different possible solutions or just wondering what actually did happen and who did it, which I personally didn't like, especially since the only element that seems to be factual is the name of the victim and the horrible way she was murdered.
Then there's the fact that the movie jumps around a lot.  It would have you believe that the murder is the center and focal point of the plot, and while most of the time it is, sometimes it jumps around and loses that focus, and also the story doesn't go in depth with the investigation, it stays just on the surface, which I thought was a negative for a movie like this.
Then the other issue I had with the movie is how the boxing match between Lee and Bucky was put in.  In the book I found it to be essential to the story, but here it makes the first few minutes drag on and isn't even necessary for the story, except maybe to help depict what Los Angeles was like at the time.
Other than that the movie in itself is fairly entertaining, although it is dark, and if you let go of that whole reality/fiction problem the story in itself is fairly captivating, and gives a somewhat historical insight on what L.A. was like at that time.
Just as a warning though, if you happen to be squeamish around blood and mutilated corpses, beware.  There are one or two scenes where the corpse is shown as it's described (mouth slit, body cut in half, etc...) and it's somewhat haunting when you think someone actually did do that.  There's also a scene where you see part of the murder act taking place and it's bloody and unbearable to sit through, but it only lasts about 40 seconds.

The peformances are also fairly good.  I thought Scarlett Johansson was amazing and fit her role perfectly, as did Josh Hartnett. Aaron Eckhart was less convincing but still good.  As for Hilary Swank, I don't know if it was her or just the script, but I thought she was just a tad ""over the top"". But amidst everyone, the best performance comes from Mira Kirshner, even if she does play a dead girl.
If anything, I'd say it's a movie that's in the same vein as Hollywoodland would be (consider it a teen version of it), but that's to be taken with a huge grain of salt because it's not at all of the same caliber.  Even so, it's a movie I'd recommend, because even if it has its share of flaws, it's still good and you won't be bored.",1163116800,8,3886,4.411188811188811

1583413,2,B00005JP96,"For any filmgoers who remember the brilliant works of Brian De Palma back in the 70s and 80s, `The Black Dahlia' a crime novel inspired by true case of a horrible murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, should have been great opportunity for the maestro to come back. Unfortunately, he misses it, and though you can still enjoy his signature bravura camera, like its frequent vertical movement, you feel he has lost touch.

Many people would find the story of `The Black Dahlia' very complicated, but that really doesn't bother me as far as it constantly offers something intriguing. While watching the first 30 minutes of `The Black Dahlia,' my first and only impression was boredom. We meet two cops Bucky (Josh Hartnett) and Lee (Aaron Eckhart); we see their boxing match, we are informed that they are called `Mr. Ice' and `Mr. Fire', and so on. Frankly, we don't care, and the film seems not to care either.

The mutilated body of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is found, but as the investigation goes on, the situation surrounding her death gets far more sinister than her dead body suggested at first. Unfortunately, these lurid aspects of the story seem not to have been treated with enough attention from the actors or director, who failed to understand that obsession of these characters for the darker side of humans (represented by stag film, for example) is exactly the point of James Ellroy or any noir films. Bucky gets involved with three ladies, all doomed in different ways - Kay (Scarlett Johansson) marked with B.D., Madeline (Hilary Swank) daughter of rich family, and of course, Elizabeth - but the portrait of the detective is not credible enough, failing to convince us of his intense emotions.

Same thing can be said about Lee trying to hide something from his partner and us, something very important as to which we are not given enough clues, and which Brian De Palma suddenly starts to explain hurriedly in the last 20 minutes. By the time you fully grasp what is going on here, the film is almost over, leaving us far behind. `L. A. Confidential' (based on Ellroy's novel) has also a fairly complicated story, but it never leaves us behind. Its intense characters, all obsessed for something dark, grab your heart from the very beginning.

However, you don't see such driving force in the so-so acting of the entire cast of `The Black Dahlia' except Mia Kirshner playing the titular character. What was impressive in other noirs like `Laura' turns into something (unwittingly) silly and campy. We must see boxer-turned-cop Bucky is fatally attracted to the gorgeous ladies both miscast, and Fiona Shaw gives us one of the most embarrassing acting in this decade. Is her overacting really intentional? If so, what's the intention?

Thankfully we have atmospheric photography of Vilmos Zsigmond, superb costume design of Jenny Beavan, and first-rate production design of Dante Ferretti. But for all their fine works, all I can say about `The Black Dahlia' is `mess.' Beautiful, but still a mess.",1161216000,5,3018,4.909803921568628

The investigation leads Bucky to Madeline Linscott (Swank), and soon he is in a relationship he shouldn't be with a possible witness.  At the same time, sparks are flying with Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Johansson), but going down that path would be disastrous for his relationship with his partner.  As Bucky and Lee get closer to the truth, things get dangerous, and neither of them might have long left to live.

""The Black Dahlia"" is based on the novel by James Ellroy, and not the real-life unsolved mystery.

What surprised me most about The Black Dahlia was not that Brian DePlama phoned it in, since he's done that with the majority of the movies he's made in his career, and certainly everything he's done since Raising Cain. It was also not that most of the principals in this movie were at best miscast. It wasn't even that the movie ended up not really being about the Black Dahlia case in any more than a subplot. No, upon reflection, I can't even say that the thing that most surprised me about it was that we had to have a twenty-minute ""and so I have you all gathered in the room, and I shall now reveal who the killer is!"" sequence. No, the thing that most surprised me about The Black Dahlia was that the crew who made this movie could, consciously or not, attempt a straight remake of L. A. Confidential and come up so hideously, horribly short.

And yes, this might as well have been a remake of L. A. Confidential. All the same basic fetishes are there (though whether one can blame James Ellroy for this or those who adapt his books to the screen choosing to emphasize some points of his writing I don't know, as I've never read James Ellroy). The movie unfolds in the same manner, and the basic premise is so similar you could put Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett's roles and no one would know the difference. In fact, you'd probably have come up with a better movie; Josh Hartnett brings all the weight of obsession to this role that Jack Nicholson did to his in Sean Penn's woefully ineffective adaptation of The Pledge five years previous. Aaron Eckhart does a better job with the obsession angle, but he seems to have a problem getting anything else to work. There's the celebrity-lookalike angle, though Mia Kirshner and Hilary Swank, as has been commented on by, I believe, everyone who has reviewed this movie to date, look about as much alike as do a great dane and a haddock. (You decide which is which.) And, of course, there's the claustrophobic thirties cinematography. But where L. A. Confidential fires on every cylinder, The Black Dahlia is still trying to get out of the gate. Everything about it says it's a cheaper, low-rent knockoff. And then, of course, you get the ""oh, this is how I solved the crime"" phase, which should be outlawed in movies, and that just puts the cap on it.

Could've been such a good movie. And ended up so mediocre. * ",1160956800,4,2442,4.493243243243243

Even today the debate over who her killer was rages on in true crime paper backs and on the internet.  The title of this film noir mess is in fact ""The Black Dahlia"", therefore you'd think the movie would be about the infamous case.  It is...loosely; very loosely.  If the detectives involved in the real life case were as distracted by as many weird subplots as the buddy boxing cops in this movie[Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett], then it's no wonder the homicidal maniac was never collered.  The butchered body of the Black Dahlia takes a back seat to a fixed boxing match, a police levy, 2 different love triangles [and a referenced 3rd invloving Short and 2 other women], a bank robbery and an old enemy out for revenge on Eckhart's obsessive character.  Scarlett Johansson is the 3rd leg of the first love triangle.  She looks lovely, fitting in perfectly with the time period.  Unfortunately she's given stupid dialogue to chew and nothing much else to do except sit around in Eckhart's ill gotten house and wait for her 2 men to come home and fawn over her.  After a while you get impatient waiting for the cops to actually get somewhere on the Short case, or at least pay more attention to it than the other myriad of distractions that they keep falling over.

The ending is so absurd and bizarre you almost wish they had just left the mystery stay a mystery rather than concocting this campy twist that doesn't seem possible.  Sometimes things in a novel read a lot better on paper than they do on the big screen and this movie is a good example of that concept.  Whereas LA Confidential transfered well to film, this hopelessly slick puzzle just gets weighed down by too many off the wall story lines and scenery ranging from lesbian bars to snuff movie sets and finally a crazy pre-suicide confession that passes as a conclusion to the Dahlia's case.  It all looks great and the characters come close to resonating as somebody you'd care about but one gets totally lost and frustrated with the circumstances.  It's not that the plot is necessarily complicated, it just doesn't make a lot of sense the way it is played out.

1583417,5,B00005JP96,"Most of you probably know that this review will be about as far from objective as you can get. I love Brian De Palma. I don't think that I could hate anything he makes. That being said, I don't absolutely love everything he does either. So when I go see a De Palma film, I basically expect to either love it more than anything or just think it was pretty good. The Black Dahlia, fortunately, applies to the former. This movie is amazing on so many levels, that it really should get an entire post of its own. But since I don't have the time, I am going to make this short and amazingly sweet. The actors in the film are amazing (exception with Josh Hartnett, who isn't bad, but he isn't great, either). Scarlett Johannson and Hilary Swank both portray women in the 50s on totally opposite ends of the spectrum on every level. Aaron Eckhart is great in a sadly under-utilized role as the detective who becomes obsessed with the Dahlia case and is also dealing with extremely dangerous events from his past coming back to haunt him. The film looks amazing too. You would never know that this entire movie was shot in Bulgaria, but now I just told you, so you do know. They recreated 40s L.A. like you couldn't imagine. And to top it all off, Brian De Palma puts his ultimate stamp on the film. What else could I ask for? By far the best scene of the film is the ""De Palma set piece"" of the movie. A huge marble staircase in the lobby of a skyscraper is the background for one of the most intense, heart-stopping sequences that I can remember in recent memory. And to make it even more excruciating for the viewer, De Palma trademarks it by shooting it all in total slow motion. Unbelievable. I won't go into the details on the plot, because it is a little tough to describe what's going on without revealing some twists that happen about halfway through. But trust me, The Black Dahlia is a ride worth taking.",1160265600,8,1907,4.374647887323944
1583418,1,B00005JP96,"I did not read James Ellroy's book, but if this movie is faithful to it, then shame on Ellroy and shame on DePalma, both, for using the famous Black Dahlia case as a hook. This film has very little to do with the Dahlia case other than using it as a backdrop for a really uninteresting, virtually incomprehensible story, and though the tagline claims ""inspired by the most notorious unsolved murder in California history,"" it isn't inspired at all.

I was painfully aware through every scene of how hard this film was trying to achieve noir greatness, the formula for which would appear to be countless cigarette lightings, overdramatized gestures and reactions, and a requisite number of references to Mickey Cohen and Johnnie Stompanado. Most of the actors seem to be phoning in their performances here; there is a flatness to the characters. I thought the attempt to weave the obscure reference to Conrad Veidt and The Man Who Laughs into the already weak premise was just pathetic. Is this Ellroy's tangent to the Dahlia? His explanation for Elizabeth Short's mouth being sliced? An interesting idea, but not enough to carry this along.

Occasionally, someone comes up for air, like Hillary Swank, only to be drawn back down into the quicksand. I thought the best part of this movie was k.d. lang a la Victor Victoria in the bar scene.

I saw this film at a screening which was the culmination to an afternoon bus tour around Los Angeles visiting sites relating to the real Black Dahlia murder. It became obvious during that tour that the real murder story held far too little conclusive evidence to support any viable plotlines. There is too much speculation and conjecture, complicated further by fame seekers who were after their fifteen minutes and all too willing to offer testimony. [In modern terms, think Jon Benet confessor.]

Genre films always seem to come out in groups, and if you're looking to get your money's worth in film noir, RUN, don't walk, away from The Black Dahlia and towards Hollywoodland. While not flawless, it is a much better film. Also based on real life events that remain murky and clouded, it presents a plausible array of theories in a far more engaging plotline.

Several others have cited The Untouchables as an example of Brian DePalma's best work, but the obvious comparison in my eyes here is Dressed to Kill or Body Double. Hard to believe the man who gave us that kind of edge-of-your-seat, bolt-the-door suspense could sign his name to this convoluted, sensationalistic dead-end. This didn't even feel like a Brian DePalma movie but for the serendipitous inclusion of William Finley (Winslow Leach!)

Such big names, associated with such trash - what a waste.  For me, and the audience I saw this with, the bright spot was the woman who played Ramona Linscott.  She was a scream, kind of a cross between Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest"" and Bette Davis in ""Baby Jane"", except not quite as subtle and restrained as either of those performances.

1583490,2,B00005JP96,"Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" is like a beautiful sports car with no engine under the hood: it sits there looking mighty pretty, but it never actually goes anywhere.

The movie is based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, a highly fictionalized telling of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved murder case. On January 15, 1947, a young woman named Beth Short was found brutally slain - her body gruesomely dismembered and gutted - in a field in Los Angeles. The case became a cause celebre around the nation, with speculation rife as to the background of the victim and the identity of the perpetrator, but the actual killer was never found. The movie focuses on two fictional homicide detectives, played by Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who, to varying degrees, become obsessed with the case. Their investigation leads them into the heart of a film noir maelstrom comprised almost exclusively of twisted psychosexual perverts and Tinsel Town sickos.

Thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond's fine cinematography and all the spiffy 1940's paraphernalia with which the costume designer and art directors have decked out the movie, ""The Black Dahlia"" is never anything but dazzling to look at, but in almost every other respect, the film is a monumental disappointment. Although the first half is relatively straightforward in its approach and style, by about the midway point, De Palma's trademark cinematic excesses - stilted dialogue, floridly staged action scenes, campy performances, and overemphatic music - begin to take over and the film becomes an incoherent mess.

It becomes virtually impossible to keep all the characters straight without a program, and poor Fiona Shaw - so wonderful in ""Mountains of the Moon"" - is required to overact so outrageously that audiences the world over will be doubled over in laughter at her scenery-chewing histrionics. Her climactic speech - in which she names names and blurts out all the details of the crime, of course - will surely go down in movie history as one of those classic it's-so-bad-it's-good moments that movie lovers everywhere will be mimicking and howling over for years to come.

Not that the other actors fare much better. Hartnett gives his all to the role of Bucky Bleichert but, as an actor, he lacks the gravitas necessary to make the character interesting. Eckhart is forced to thrash around inside a character whose motivations are never convincingly spelled out for either the actor or the audience, and Scarlet Johansson and Hilary Swank seem to be doing parodies of crime thriller vixens rather than serious interpretations of believable, three-dimensional characters.

It pains me to have to say this, but no one comes out smelling like a rose with this ""Dahlia.""",1159660800,116,2738,5.089086859688196

I thought that I had walked into a boxing movie. Eventually, the subject of the Black Dahlia murder was revealed, but not by much.  It remained a sub-sub-subplot to all the other plots, of which there are far too many. There are also too many smarmy twists and turns of which the viewer can care nothing about because they have nothing to do with the Elizabeth Short murder...the title of the movie, remember?  In addition, all through the movie viewers are introduced to more and more campy, sleazy, over-the-top characters, which you also can care nothing about, because they just get in the way of what you hope will eventually become a plot.  And from what I have read about Elizabeth Short, she was not the hopeless sleazoid that she was portayed as in the movie. I will say that the sets, costumes, and locations were perfectly done for the period. However, the ending is a ridiculous exercise in freakish vaudeville and totally insulting to the viewers' intelligence.

1583493,4,B00005JP96,"Brian De Palma's THE BLACK DAHLIA is the movie of the year so far for me, and the almost unanimous negative reviews baffle me.  Yes, the film dares to solve Hollywood's most legendary unsolved crime, but it is based on a novel by James Ellroy (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) and not on strict fact.  I have not had the pleasure of reading Ellroy's book because it seems long out of print at Amazon.com.  The fact is that a beautiful raven-haired aspiring actress named Elizabeth ""Betty"" Short was found savagely murdered in a vacant Hollywood weed field in early 1947, her body cut in half and her mouth cut from ear to ear.  Her killer was never found.  The case was never closed and may, in fact, still be open.

The De Palma fiction is convincing:  boxing detective rivals  Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett tie the case to lesbian actress Hilary Swank and the filmmaker who directed sleazy 16mm black-and-white films starring Elizabeth Short.  De Palma wisely never shows the crime; as in real life, detectives find the dead body the next day in a vacant lot.  And we only see slivers of the corpse.  Ingeniously, and you may need to be a film scholar to pick up on this, the slashed mouth is made to look like Conrad Veidt in a 1928 silent called THE MAN WHO LAUGHS, which is screened often during THE BLACK DAHLIA.  And both Ellroy's novel and De Palma's movie take their name, in turn, from a 1946 Alan Ladd film noir called THE BLUE DAHLIA.

The movie dares to have a romantic happy ending, which I may be alone in finding satisfying.  Hartnett wraps up the case, then goes home to his sweetie, yet another actress (Scarlett Johansson).  As with everyone in THE BLACK DAHLIA, Johansson smokes endless cigarettes, including in fancy black holders.  (Actually, I am getting tired of seeing her smoking in every movie.)  This movie is blessed with superb actors and, contrary to the critics, actors whom I personally found comfortable playing film noir and chain-smoking.  The performances are all excellent.

And, oh man, the style here!  Working all over Hollywood and, of all places, Bulgaria, De Palma and production designer Dante Ferretti truly capture the very look and smell of 1947 Los Angeles down to the slightest detail.  For a movie filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, the great Vilmos Zsigmond (THE DEER HUNTER, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) creates a dusty sepia look that is just right.  Costumer Jenny Beavan, working heavily in browns and olives and blacks in dresses and blouses and sweaters and suits, has done costumes for James Ivory.  And the trumpet sound of Mark Isham's score evokes nothing less than the towering score by Jerry Goldsmith for CHINATOWN.  These people and everyone else are working at peak form.

But at the helm is Brian De Palma, whose direction is just perfection.  I adore THE BLACK DAHLIA and highly recommend it, now in a theater or soon on letterboxed DVD--hopefully with an excellent and chilling 1970's TV movie with Lucie Arnaz called WHO IS THE BLACK DAHLIA? as a bonus.  De Palma's movie has a hard ""R"" rating for strong violence, strong sexual content, strong language, and heavy smoking.  122 minutes.",1159228800,7,3156,4.773062730627307
1583494,4,B00005JP96,"Exiting the theatre after seeing Brian DePalma's latest film Black Dahlia I had a lot of the same mixed-reactions as I had with David Lynch's Blue Velvet twenty years earlier. Black Dahlia like Blue Velvet is the kind of film that leaves viewers a bit dumbfounded at first; and it does not surprise me in the least that the initial reviews of Black Dahlia like the initial reviews of Blue Velvet are confused because both films leave the viewer with a feeling that they have experienced something that they can not quite make heads or tails of. I think what most reviewers, amateur and professional, are trying to do when they review Black Dahlia is sort out their own disorientation and sense of unease. The film simply refuses to do what we expect it to do (there are plenty of obvious villains but no obvious heroes) or be what we expect it to be (this is not Scarface with its caricatured over-the-top ""bad guy"" or Untouchables with its caricatured ""good guys""--Costner, Connery, Garcia-- and ""bad guy""--DeNiro); instead in Black Dahlia we are given characters that do not fit the good guy or the bad guy stereotype or good girl and bad girl stereotype and this creates anxiety in the filmgoer which is exactly what a good film noir is supposed to do. Adventure films and romances and action-thrillers give you comfortable stereotypes but film noir is the most subversive film genre out there because it refuses to give you a world where old world distinctions like ""good"" and ""bad"" have any validity and however much one would like to to impose such pat labels on these characters they simply do not stick. From the first scene DePalma thrusts us into a world where we cannot determine just who is fighting for what and just who has the upper hand. The LA Police Department in 1946 is not exactly the place to go if what you are after is justice or moral clarity for the entire department is more concerned with maintaining it own mob ties and increasing revenues from its own rackets than it is in solving crimes. What the LAPD and its various homicide and vice units are really involved in is kept in the shadows and a sense of order is maintained only because the LAPD is very good at manipulating the press. Like everything else in the city cop/press relations is a racket and its rigged. In order to thrive in this corrupt city one must be corrupt; and the more corrupt you are the better off you'll be.

When we first encounter young wanna-be detectives Eckhart and Hartnett they are just lowly cops on the beat. Most of the cops just stand by and watch the riot between the (mostly white) servicemen and the local (mostly black and latino) zootsuiters. Its a virtual race war but the cops do nothing to curb the violence. Eckhart and Hartnett aren't under any illusion that they can stop the race war but both being ex-fighters neither can resist the thrill of a good fight and so they throw themselves into the fray beating up sailors and zootsuiters indiscriminately. The fact that these two guys were both minor celebrities on the local boxing scene comes to the attention of the higher-ups who then arrange a spectacle to entertain the entire city and to win postive publicity for the police department (as well as public support for a department wide pay raise currently on the ballot). The cops agree to the fight even though they know the fight is just a huge publicity stunt because they are promised jobs as detectives as their reward. As a result of the fight both cops become ""stars"" in the public eye even though we know that they are just doing what they have to do to survive which in this case means becoming corrupt cops on the make (even the fight is of course rigged so that the cops not only win public sympathy and support but the cops can also make money betting on the fighter they know will win). Even though we want to believe one or both the cops is really a good guy we can see that there is no way for either of these guys to remian untainted by the corruption that surrounds them. And the young male cops moral corruption is juxtaposed brilliantly with the corruption of various young ladies who come to Hollywoodland in order to become ""stars"" in their own right.  Most of these young girls get only bit parts as extras and have to supplement their income by working as call-girls or doing blue films.  The Black Dahlia is exactly like many other girls her age but she ends up famous only because she ends up dead. The lurid headlines that link her to the world of porn and prostitution make her seem somehow notorious but we can see that she is just an ordinary girl who simply did what was necessary to survive. In this world crime is good business. Crime is this cities biggest employer. It gives the cops, pimps, murderers and journalists all something to do. Everyone is seen to be part of the same corrupt system; so long as there is crime and corruption everyone gets paid. The Black Dahlia just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and so she gets crushed by one of the cities especially greasy and especially maligned wheels. Just who gets villainized in such a corrupt city and why becomes one of the films central concerns.

The cops, however, make a mistake when they announce to the press early on that they will solve the Black Dahlia case when, in fact, solving the case would mean revealing the huge network of crime that seethes just below the surface of LA. Some would say that DePalma makes a mistake when he calls his film Black Dahlia when in fact that particular crime remains on the periphery for much of this film. For the noir sensibilites of James Ellroy and Brian DePalma the real interest is not in the Black Dahlia herself but in the moral emptiness and impotence that is so rampant in LA. The Black Dahlia is not so much a character (for we never get to know her; we see her only as a struggling young actress on a screen test and, ironically, playing an unwilling ""victim"" in a blue film) but a symbol of innocence lost.  The fact that the Black Dahlia story is not foregrounded more in a film that is called the Black Dahlia does frustrate those viewers that want a more conventional whodunnit. Ellroy & DePalma aren't interested in this kind of approach though. They both turn the focus away from the luridly murdered victim and onto the lurid community where the crime occurred and this actually makes for a much more interesting and nuanced kind of film experience.  But in transfering the Ellroy novel into a film DePalma goes one step further, as he always does, and makes the novel into a highly stylized film noir that is highly self-conscious and ironic about just what it is doing with the genre. For instance many noir films feature a very mannered kind of acting (where men are extremely masculine and self-possessed to the point of being caricatures of men, and women are made to embody all the anxieties that endanger that manly sense of self-possession and security) and DePalma pays homage to that technique but he also uses it for his own purposes. There was always something funny about the way the noir tough guys and their dangerous dames talked and acted but DePalma really amps up the comedy by having his characters mouth the most absurd lines. The artificiality of this noir brand of acting is used purposefully by DePalma to foreground the absurdity of the character's attitudes and how self-involved and oblivious to others these characters are; each character seems to be isolated in his/her own fantasy world.  Eckhart, Hartnett, and Johansson, though ostensibly friends, exist on three different planes (each can be seen to be following their own private agendas/ obsessions). Eckhart is manically seeking to avenge his sister's death (all villains in his eyes become his sister's rapist/murderer), Johansson is seeking to escape from a seedy past and so lives out a fantasy of being rescued (she has a superman fantasy and it doesn't seem to matter to her who is playing superman), and Hartnett acts out a narcissistic fantasy of his own as he explores his own divided nature. He is attracted to both blonde Johansson (who enables Hartnett a glimpse of himself as a superman/supercop) and to the Black Dahlia look-a-like played by a darkly coiffed Hilary Swank (who is utterly and irredeemably addicted to ""sin"" and committed to recruting as many to her devlish ways as possible and who allows Hartnett to explore his own morally ambiguous dark side at the same time he is supposed to be solving a case). Many reviewers have noted that Hilary Swank's acting seems artificial but that is the idea. Swank is playing a rich girl/ femme fatale who is self-consciously modeling herself after a dead girl. This character is the most original creation of the film. She is so jaded that she wants to meet the Black Dahlia, whom she has heard bears a striking resemblance to herself, because she thinks it would be a thrill to sleep with her own look-a-like (the ultimate act of narcissism/ self-obsession). Once the Black Dahlia is dead she seems to find it thrilling to go around playing the Black Dahlia and playing at being a street girl (but she makes no attempt to hide her accent which is a social marker of status and that she is not interested in abandoning). Swank has her character affect an accent and do it badly because the accent is itself an act, a pretence of social quality. I think a lot of credit should go to Swank for this performance for to play ""a bad actress"" convincingly(even if its just the penultimately jaded rich girl playing around with various roles out of boredom) requires accomplished acting (the same kind of thing was required of Kim Basinger in LA Confidential when she played a celebrity look-a-like hooker, but Basinger was not playing one of the upper-class and she was not to be perceived as being in control of her performance in the way that Swank's character is in control of hers). Swank's accent is horrendous and its supposed to be. Her entire dysfunctional mob of a family all affect continental accents and indulge in outrageous fantasies in order to veil their seedy realities; and it is they who collectively create a monster/martyr/sacrifice who must bear the weight of their collective guilt. (And DePalma brilliantly implicates the Eckhart/Hartnett/Johansson trio in this same kind of transference of personal guilt onto a maligned other by having them bond while watching a film about that very topic: a 1928 film version of the Victor Hugo classic The Man Who Laughs which is the story of a child who is grossly disfigured and thus made to wear a mark of his aristocratic father's sins against the king).  The entire family must be seen and heard to be believed. DePalma's den of faux aristocrats is one of the funniest and most disturbing things to appear on screen since, well, Lynch's mob of psychopaths and lunatics in Blue Velvet.  This film has been maligned because it has been misunderstood. I have no doubt that this film will be considered a classic once those who appreciate great subversive film- making have a chance to have their say.",1159142400,11,11113,4.665816326530612

1583496,2,B00005JP96,"""The Black Dahlia"" is not as putrid as the majority of the previous 31 amazon reviewers suggest.  Not quite, anyway.  In fact, if it had been made by RKO in glorious black and white about 1950 on a $90,000 budget, it would have been about two-thirds of a decent film suitable to fill the bottom half of a double feature.

The actors aren't bad, not really.  Josh Hartnett has been taking a lot of heat, and sure, he's passive, wet-behind-the-ears, not very articulate, but those characteristics would fit the leading men in many classic noir films.  His partner on the LAPD, Aaron Eckhart, is better, or potentially so, anyway.  If he'd had more than twenty words of dialogue, he might even have risen to adequate.  Scarlett Johannson is not bad in the sort of role that Gloria Grahame used to ace in every other 1950s noir flick.  It's a pity that her part as written is inconsistent and just plain doesn't make any sense.  Hillary Swank sometimes amuses in the role of the designated spider woman, but the script insists on undercutting her.  Best of the bunch is Fiona Shaw in the small part of an angry, aristocratic drunken lush.  The graceful little wave she makes at the end of her final scene is a nice touch.  Worst of the bunch is James Otis.  He has almost nothing to do and he manages to be geekily appalling at it, although to be fair, most of the blame is certainly De Palma's.

The look of ""The Black Dahlia""is sometimes impressive.  I am just old enough to remember the look of San Francisco and Northern California in 1947.  I find De Palma's Southern California streetscapes and costumes to be quite convincing.  They are refreshingly free of that weightily self-conscious period look so common in contemporary film making.  When I was about eight, I remember being a fascinated spectator at a gun battle that looked very like the one that erupts about half an hour into the film.

There are some nice directorial touches.  A couple of scenes are shot in something like the old sepia tone, probably the only way to get close to classic noir visual texture in a color film.  Unfortunately the look comes and goes without any discernable pattern.  There is an impressive crane shot that begins with a distant image of a woman running beside a green field to inform an apparently indifferent world of her horrifying discovery, swings over a building and down into an entirely different sequence, following people along the street until it stumbles into an unexpected action scene.  Technically, the shot is worthy of Otto Preminger.  Too bad it's so pointless.

I'm surprised that none of the previous reviewers has picked up on a sequence near the end of the film.  A small car drives up a curving road in the LA hills on a rainy night.  It stops outside a small, detached bungalow.  Inside the bungalow is a chi-chi bedroom in which a pornographic film has been shot.  That, my friends, is ripped right off from the Bogart-Becall version of ""The Big Sleep.""  In fact, a considerable amount of ""The Black Dahlia"" is an homage to or rather a riff on the ""The Big Sleep.""

The actors are mostly OK, the look is all right, the director steals only from the very best models, then what is the problem with ""The Black Dahlia""?  The answer is simple: the script stinks.  Some reviewers have suggested that the original novel has not been well served.  Maybe, maybe.  On the basis of this screenplay, I guarantee you that I am not going to read the book to find out for myself.

Everything about this production proclaims that it was an attempt at film noirishness.  That being the case, it must be measured against the canons of noir.

The protagonist should be some poor shnook who stumbles into catastrophe through no fault of his own (Edmond O'Brien in ""D.O.A."") or a flawed individual (a.k.a. poor shnook) who comes upon a moral dilemma and chooses the wrong course (Fred McMurray in ""Double Indemnity"").  The wrong decision, of course, leads straight to noir catastrophe.  In ""The Black Dahlia,"" the requisite poor shnook has been cut into two half-shnooks.  He has become both Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart.  Hartnett, the chief poor shnook, does not experience catastrophe from either bad luck or poor judgement.  In fact, whenever he meets with a setback he immediately finds an attractive woman who is instantly ready for sweaty and, truth to tell, rather uncomfortable looking sex.  His last scene in the film is so profoundly un-noirish that it might have been lifted from a Doris Day movie.  Eckhart, on the other hand, faces the moral dilemma, but he does it entirely off-camera.

A film noir should have the directness and inevitability to win the full approval of a Greek tragedian.  In ""Double Indemnity,"" Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson are--we are twice told--on the street car and bound to ride to the end of the line.  And at the end of the line is the cemetery.  ""The Black Dahlia"" is about as direct as a funhouse hall of mirrors.  There are simply too many set-ups for too many plot lines from too many old movies.  Here are a few:

--The LAPD as a semi-corrupt state within a state, ""Serpico-Lite.""

--A buddy picture, Butch and Sundance in blue.

--A boy-girl-boy love triangle, ""Design for Living"" without the wit.

--Daughters warped and corrupted by LA development money--""Chinatown,"" ""The Big Sleep""--take your pick.

--Shocked fascination at the gay lifestyle; prurience right out of  ""Advise and Consent.""

--Shadowy figures in creepy-crawly murder extravaganzas--old fashioned when the first silent version of ""The Cat and the Canary"" appeared on screen.

--Barking madness among the monied and aristocratic, ""The Ruling Class.""

And one and on.  No sooner does a plot line thrust itself forward, then it drops with a thud.  What about that bundled money, for instance?  When and why exactly did A hand it over to B?  Who were the mysterious Cs who were putting pressure on B to pay up?  Who among D, E, of F gets its in the end?  And what does he (she, they) do with it?

Finally, there are the elements that flat out don't make any sense.  I'll point out just two involving Hillary Swank.  Why does she insist repeatedly that she and the Black Dahlia look alike?  They don't, that is, no more than any pair of dark haired women.  Officer Hartnett picks up Swank in a troll of lesbian clubs (whose inhabitants are comfortable with the presence of an on-duty cop to a degree WHOLLY unknown in 1947, it ought to be noted.)  Swank freely admits that she herself had trolled for and found the soon-to-be Black Dahlia and another female in those same clubs.  Why, then, does Hartnett spring out of Swank's bed with such shocked revulsion and horror when she tells him that she had a sexual encounter with the Dahlia?

1583497,2,B00005JP96,"Except for about a  hour about half way through Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" when Hillary Swank arrives on the scene there is a bit of hope that all is not lost. But alas, Swank merely provides a short respite from the unrelenting boredom of this film...as it is way too long and not particularly about the sensational, gruesome and surgical-like, real-life murder of Elizabeth Short (a sad and quite effective Mia Kirschner) in 1947 Los Angeles, the Black Dahlia of the title because she always dressed in black.

If De Palma had decided to concentrate on just the murder and the investigation (which still goes on now some 60 years later) he would have had the makings of a, if not great, at least an intriguing film: the basic, true-life  story is rife with mystery, sex, prostitution, kink and white slavery. But instead he has mucked up the film with added elements that do nothing but stray from the basic story and add nothing but silly detail.

Scarlett Johansson continues her decline (at 20, no less), Josh Hartnett tries his best in a thankless role and Aaron Eckhart chews the scenery not with relish but with a kind of grim, ugly anger that leads you to believe that Eckhart  sensed early on in the filming that he was in a turkey.

Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) meet in the early 40s, as each is trying to protect a small neighborhood in Los Angeles from riots between returning servicemen and zoot suiters. Then, someone in the department learns that each has a background in boxing; Los Angeles is set to vote on a bond measure that will increase the pay for all police officers and the fight will be good publicity. Bucky bets against himself, to earn some money to put his aging German immigrant father in a nice nursing home, but puts up a good fight before losing. The fight generates the required publicity, the bond passes, and each of the men is promoted to the Warrants division of the Detective Squad. Soon, Bucky meets Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), Lee's girlfriend, who likes to attend his fights, sketch the action and say titillating things to both men. Soon, the three are sharing a lot of time together and Kay clutches both of their hands during a scary moment in a silent film. As the two men stake out a warrant, a man opens fire and a shootout begins. Throughout, there is some question about an old arrest Lee was involved in; the convict was Kay's former pimp and a bank robbery was pinned on him. Bucky meets Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), a woman who comes from a rich family, and they begin a hot and torrid affair. Oh, and a young struggling actress named Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirschner) is murdered in a particularly gruesome fashion and becomes known as ""The Black Dahlia"".

""The Black Dahlia"", directed by Brian DePalma, written by Josh Friedman, and based on a James Ellroy book, is a completely fictionalized account of what might have happened. Yet, everyone involved seems to go to great pains to skirt the most interesting part of the film, the mystery of the Black Dahlia, and we get lengthy bits about boxing, the love affair between Kay and Lee, Bucky's attraction to Lee, Bucky's relationship with Madeline, an old bank robbery, and much, much more. And only one of these story threads is even remotely related to the mystery of ""The Black Dahlia"". I am a big fan of learning a lot about a character's background, but it has to have some bearing on or connect to the main story. In ""The Black Dahlia"", no one seems to know what the main story is.

Like any attempt at Film Noir, ""The Black Dahlia"" has a voice over and in this case, the voice over is provided by Hartnett, who plays the main character, a police office named ""Bucky"". Throughout the voice over, Hartnett mumbles this and that, trying to evoke a certain mood, but he is incapable of doing so. Film Noir voice over requires a voice evoking experience, hard knocks, a challenged life. Hartnett is too young and inexperienced to pull this off.

Then, there is his acting. Hartnett is one of those actors who have basically one facial expression. Through any and all situations, the same face. It doesn't matter whether he is unhappy, overjoyed, morose, at death's door, whatever the situation he always seems glum. It is really incomprehensible to me why he continues to work in multimillion dollar films. There are many pretty women who have had shorter careers because they are unable to act as well. Yet Hartnett continues to get work.

Because he is unable to change his facial expression, Bucky becomes a cardboard character and we simply don't care for him as he tries to work through this complicated mystery.

Aaron Eckhart fares a little better. As Lee, he has the looks and the acting ability to make us believe in his character. But the character seems to be a retread of the same troubled sole Russell Crowe played so well in ""L.A. Confidential"", which is also based on a book by James Ellroy. But as acceptable as Eckhart is, his character is marred by problems. He is obsessed with a case, but it isn't really the Black Dahlia. He has a haunted past, but it isn't connected with the Black Dahlia. Lee also seems to be providing comic relief at points, joking around and mugging for the camera as he realizes Bucky and Kay are growing closer.

Scarlett Johannson's Kay Lake is in the same boat as Josh Hartnett's Bucky. They are both too young and can't exude enough life experience for these roles. Sure they both look great, but this role is the type of thing Barbara Stanwyck, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall and other great actresses would take on and sink their teeth into. Johansson just isn't in their league, at least not yet. Her performance is more evocative of a teenager in a high school play, trying to get their mouth used to all of the big people words and speech patterns. At the middle of a love triangle, she is clearly doing her best to appear sexually attractive, but her expression almost never changes. When she is upset, her face is blank. When she is trying to sexually tease Bucky, her face is blank. Not a very interesting performance.

Hillary Swank appears in her most sexual role to date. Perhaps after playing transgenders and women who want to be championship boxers, she was ready for a change. She certainly appears glamorous and fares the best of all the actors, but during the last few moments of the film, her character just completely falls apart. I can't really reveal why, because to do so would spoil any surprises the film holds for those of you who choose to not heed my advice.

""The Black Dahlia"" contains a couple of signature Brian DePalma set pieces. Yet, even these seem like retreads from his more interesting, better films. But the last few minutes of the film are so ludicrous it completely disintegrates any technical expertise these exhibit. This is the type of film where everyone even remotely connected to Bucky is involved in one of the two mysteries he is involved in. Yet throughout, he seems to have no idea. When he finally starts to realize this, he confronts them and demands ""Tell me the truth"" at which point, they break down and begin a long confession. Occasionally, DePalma decides to show us a bit of a flashback, to break the monotony of a long monologue. But that happens only occasionally, and usually to help explain the more incredulous connections.

""The Black Dahlia"" would be, perhaps, an acceptable film, but the last twenty minutes completely erase any good will the film may have generated. Attempting to wrap the story up, and provide some resolution to the mystery of the Black Dahlia, DePalma and Friedman create a patchwork of unbelievable and bad performances, clues that didn't exist and outlandish story ideas. What happens when you combine all of this? You have a mess.

1583561,3,B00005JP96,"MOVIE: This was supposed to be the big Oscar contender of the year. People sit up and take notice when De Palma takes the director's chair. De Palma directed The Untouchables, one of my favorite movies of all time. However, The Black Dahlia is probably his biggest dud ever, even more so than Mission To Mars. Rarely do you see a film with so much potential go absolutely nowhere. The trailer would lead you to believe that the movie was about the murder of actress Elizabeth Short and the entire process of uncovering the mystery. The movie is more about the characters and the murder sort of serves as a backdrop to the central plot. That's where the problem of the film lies. There is no focus in the plot as to what the movie is actually about, and it doesn't help that it moves at an incredibly slow pace. The film is centered around three main characters: Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). Two buddy detectives fall upon the case of Elizabeth Short during a routine bust, and we slowly move away from the case and just see how it affects their relationship with their female friend. What follows is a mess of film noir that uses the case merely as a backdrop. There was also one aspect of the film that just sort of took me out of the whole experience, and that was the use of the POV (point of view) shot. It was used sparingly for Hartnett's character with absolutely no dramatic effect. The reason why you don't see POV shots that much out of horror films is that a camera does not mimick human vision. If we saw the way a camera saw then our eyeballs would not be able to move, so when POV is used in film it has to be used for a real purpose. Here, De Palma uses it with no purpose to it and it was just frustrating. The only thing it did do was take me out of the movie. There was a distance between me as an audience member from the story being told on screen, and when you lose that emotional connection then the film becomes boring. Let me state right now what the trailer tried to trick you with. The movie is based on a book by James Ellroy who is the author of the novel L.A Confidential, not the screenwriter of either films. The screenwriter of L.A Confidential and this film are two different people. Josh Friedman wrote the screenplay for The Black Dahlia, and his previous work only consists of Chain Reaction and War Of The Worlds (2005). So, you can see we have a novice screenwriter on our hands, and that is where I point my finger to blame.

ACTING: While there are no Academy Award winning actors in the film, we do have a pretty great selection of talent. Josh Hartnett fits the role and does a mighty fine job of playing it. Aaron Eckhart was pretty good too, his character was what really made the film a film noir. Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses, and she does a great job here. She plays the counterpart to Hilary Swank's character (look for the black/white contrast in the characters' appearance), but Hilary Swank may I say was quite awful in this. I just didn't like her acting in the movie, which is strange because I loved her in Million Dollar Baby and Insomnia. She doesn't add any depth to her character and she merely serves as a plot device who will end up helping you easily figure out who the murdere is. Anyway, the acting can't hide the fact that the script is in disarray.

BOTTOM LINE: Brian De Palma doesn't give the film any style, Mark Isham's weak score didn't help either. There was a real lack of atmosphere despite great sets and costumes, and I blame the score for that. The lack of focus lies in the script's flaws, and don't look for the acting to save it. The movie swung hard and missed the target completely. Universal spent $60 million on the production, and with the recent release of Hollywoodland I figure that someone stole from someone. If you want less cheesy film noir and a great movie experience then go see Hollywoodland.",1158624000,5,3978,4.425648021828104

1583563,3,B00005JP96,"While this film is not Brian De Palma's best film ever, it does have its moments. Some people say that they didn't get what the director was trying to do with the dialogue or with certain scenes, etc. If anyone has an appreciation, a true appreciation for noir and old films in general then they entirely comprehend what he was trying to do from the beginning of the film. When the title of the film was shown, we already knew this wasn't going to be your typical Hollywood type of film, he chose to show it in old script, as well as in the ending where he chose to put ""The End"" movies just don't go like that nowadays.

De Palma uses old noir techniques as well as references to old films such as Laura. He uses the obsession over the dead female character by the cop(s) in order to get the movie to move along. He also uses the 40's dialogue, I mean if you've never even watched a film from that period you may never get some of the things they were talking about but how is that his fault? De Palma was going for a certain type of film when he started this project, you can tell because of the way he lit certain scenes, certain characters, and of course the dialogue as I've already mentioned. He chose backlighting for some, lighting from beneath for others for the dramatic effect . . . he did a great job of choosing what he wanted to make a color noir film, in my opinion. After all, this is what this is, my opinion. I really disliked the character Johansson played but that's not to say it's because of her acting per se, but more so because of the script. Both her and Hartnett's relationship did bother me within the film because they should have respected each other a little more given that Eckhart's character had done so much for both of them. But this has nothing to do with De Palma really and more to do with the screenwriter, although De Palma should have taken more charge of that as well.

All in all, I believe the film is worth watching for its aesthetic elements, for what De Palma is able to show you and not so much what the characters really did. I truly enjoyed Hilary Swank's character as well as her family, I thought they were mind-blowing, but was that necessary? Probably not. I also think that the horror movie elements were unnecessary but I get why he was doing it, the horrors of what was done to her body. This beautiful woman that no one knew being deformed . . . one reason why we never really get to see her as much as many people would like to, we can't know her because no one really did . . . not her lovers, not her father, not the people she worked with, etc. The scenes with Mia as the Dahlia were haunting and beautiful because they were so sad, because she was so tragic and was trying so hard to make it in the acting world. So many women were striving for that back then and even now, that is what is tragic about her and that is what makes her memorable in the film as well as what makes everyone want to find out who killed her. She is what made me like it (aside from De Palma's style and Hilary's acting). After all this, if I made you want to see it or if you're unsure . . . go watch it at a cheap theatre at least so you can have some say in the matter.",1158624000,3,3213,4.147435897435898

1583565,1,B00005JP96,"I would just like everyone to know that I don't hate the noir genre.  In fact, I love it, which is exactly why I hated ""The Black Dahlia.""  Every style, dialogue, music track oozed the stench of a director trying too hard.  I'm surprised there wasn't subtitles repeating the words, ""Look, this movie is so noir.""  Every second that was absent dialogue was replaced with that old detective narration, which can work, but I just found it annoying in this movie.  There was also a lot of bad melow-dramatic acting in conjunction with loose threads that tied characters together for unlikely reasons other than sex.

The obsession over the Black Dahlia seemed a bit too slapped together as well.  The hype over the most ""gruesome"" murder is not really developed well since the gruesome part is not really developed until the end with a memory of a corpse.  Unless you think two attractive ladies making a lesbian nuddy flick is gross, don't buy into the gruesome hype.

Hunting the killer becomes a bit repetative and the clues just all fit too easily to finally end the movie.  I guessed who the prime suspect was going to be in the begining, with no evidence other than the actor's obvious need to be labelled the killer.  And of course, the characters around this individual will help in a conspiracy.

This mystery thriller has nothing too thrilling.  Nor is it much of a mystery.  The emotion that should connect characters is loose and melow-dramatic.  The acting is mediocore at best.  And  Detective Josh is just not the hardcore individual who can play the burn-out cop a noir film requires.

There is absolutely no way anyone could follow every subtle nuance in this film unless they watched it numerous times, and I do mean numerous.  Seeing it just once was enough to sway me from that even remotely occurring.

The first hour of the movie, basically doesn't even deal with the Dahlia murder.  In fact, it gets ignored until the very end of the movie.  I think most theater-goers were expecting a more or less ""Court TV"" type of movie, and most knew it was theoretical, but the manner in which it all unfolds and does so in such a boring, tedious and antsy manner, leaves you with a feeling of ""is it over yet?""  I'm extremely patient in waiting for things to all come together.  But even when it did, it wasn't worth the time.  This film gets zero stars.  The absolute worst of the year.

1583569,2,B00005JP96,"What. A. Bust. ""The Black Dahlia"" is a disaster of campy melodrama and grim exploitation and a collision of competing genres, performances and moods, all fueled by director Brian DePalma's goofy peccadilloes and obsessions. It's like huffing angel dust while unmanned blimps crash into Lake Huron. Just wait until the scene at the lesbian cabaret.

DePalma (""Scarface, ""The Untouchables"") and screenwriter Josh Friedman (""War Of The Worlds"") adapt the James Ellroy novel that established him as this generation's Raymond Chandler. Ellroy retold the 1947 Los Angeles murder of Elizabeth Ann Short, an aspiring actress cut in half and disemboweled, a clown's smile carved in her mouth. The papers named Short ""Black Dahlia"" for her habit of walking up and down Sunset Boulevard in mourning clothes. The case remains unsolved.

The book and movie ""close"" it through the work of two detectives - controlled Bucky (Josh Hartnett), and more volatile Lee (Aaron Eckhart) - a couple of ex-boxers of average investigative skills (and poorer ethics) who more or less stumble into a bizarre conspiracy beyond their pay grade. They also share a strange, mostly-platonic relationship Kay Lake (Scarlett Johannson) who cooks them big dinners, uses a cigarette holder and has the letters of a gangster carved into her back.

Where do we start with this deranged bit of cinema? How about here: The casting stinks. Eckhart's too manic as the terse Lee, while Hartnett's is his usual study in out-of-depth confusion. And Ms. Scarlett? Crash. Burn. Cringe.

At 21, she's far too young - Kim Basinger was 43 when for her Oscar-winning role in the adaptation of Ellroy's ""LA Confidential"" - and too tongue-tied for the rat-a-tat dialogue of film noirs. Worst, she is saddled with DePalma's habit of casting blonde women as sex idols, like when Johannson straddles the toilet in an open nightgown, wordlessly challenging Bucky to bolt up the stairs and take her. He shakes his head, and she slams the door, her loins denied.

It gets steamier! DePalma's take on post-war lesbianism is a raucous piano bar of kissing-girl chorus lines and k.d. lang crooning ""Time For Love."" The camera swoops about as Bucky casually asks if anybody ever knew the disemboweled girl. Into this absurdity walks Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), a socialite who bills herself as a Dahlia lookalike. Bucky sure thinks so. The last half of the movie settles in with Madeline and her certifiable family. They know where the bodies are buried and who put them there.

""The Black Dahlia"" is probably at its craziest, and maybe its best, in these scenes. The Linscott clan unravels while Madeline tries to balance her repulsion with psychotic loyalty. Swank doesn't resemble the real Dahlia, or Mia Kirshner, who plays her in the movie. But with the Hepburn accent and theatrical eyes,  she seems to be the only lead actor in on DePalma's joke.

The final act is faithful to Ellroy's novel, but it seems far more ridiculous here, because of the movie's already scattershot plot and endlessly shifting moods.

Elizabeth Short is only seen through screen tests and a stag film, but Kirshner makes a tragic impression as a street urchin so hungry for stardom - for anything - that she's beautiful in her self-delusions. A couple scenes later, Bucky and Kay are pushing aside a Cornish game hen to make it on the dining table. We see Elizabeth humiliated in the porno. Then Bucky's striding over to Madeline's for a romp.

There's so much insipid, unbridled passion between Bucky, Kay and Madeline that you sense DePalma's mocking it - the last scene scoffs at the idea of a truly happy ending - but these jabs at convention are thrown on top of a novel lurid enough for three movies. ""The Black Dahlia"" boldly goes, and goes, and goes. And go-go-go-goes.  It's the freakiest duckling of the year.",1158451200,4,3844,4.97196261682243

But so did Femme Fatale, de Palma's previous film, the first time I saw it, and now it is one of my favorites.

The story is about the detective Bucky more than the Black Dahlia, keep this in mind.  It is a love story, and a mystery.

James Ellroy was brought to my attention through the Movie ""La Confidential"". I like the movie so much that I picked up Ellroy's book ""The Black Dahlia"" and found that the book was very good and followed this with ""The Big Nowhere"" which was also very good. Needless to say I was excited when I saw that the Dahlia movie was coming out. I knew that if it could take a fraction of what LA had it would be great.
As I was watching the movie I began to realize one large problem.....This story is way too large and sprawling to be told in a 2 -21/2 hour movie. All aspects of the story had to be chopped to make it fit together. Bucky's relationship with Kay and Lee and the amount of time they spent together couldn't be summed up in 10 minutes, nor could Bucky's relationship with Madeleine. Lee's obsession with the case was another aspect that couldn't be summed up. I think the attempt to ""quickly wrap up"" all these aspects of the story will leave anyone who hasn't read the book wondering what the hell is going on. Even though they attempted this wrap up too much screen time is devoted to this and too little to them actually pursuing the Dahlia case. Realistically, this movie would need to be 4 hours for it to accurately detail the important aspects of the story.

The Good: The core of the story is there and if you read the book you will still probably enjoy the movie though it might be the memories brought back from having read the book that you are enjoying. Of all the performances I though Fiona Shaw did a great job as Ramona Linscott, Madeleine Linscott's crazy mother. Even though her screen time was short, her's were some of the more impactful scenes, especially her last scene.

The Bad: This movie couldn't be done in 2 hours. The story is too large and sprawling and needed much more time. Too little time is spent on the Dahlia case. The director seemed to try and shoot the movie in a 1940'ish style including his actors/actress's performances and music to make it feel like a time piece. I kept waiting for one of the characters to say ""Here's looking at you babe"" or something along those lines. He should have taken a note from Curtis Hansen (Director if LA) and just done the movie straight and used costumes and Set to tell the time. The Performances were too over the top sometimes bordering on camp.

Overall: Even with all the bad a fan of the book will likely still find some enjoyment in the movie however if you haven't read the book you be left wondering what it was all about.",1158451200,,2706,4.7025316455696204

But I guess no one would actually bother to go see it. If you're wanting to know about the REAL story then buy a book on it, it's alot more entertaining than this crap.

1583617,2,B00005JP96,"The Black Dahlia is a great book but a bad movie.  The actors in this film are going to take a lot of heat, but that is unfair; when all the performances are bad, it's the fault of the director.  Some people are calling for Brian DePalma to retire and, on the basis of this film, they may have a point.  It's not just that it's bad, it's aggressively bad - the kind of bad that takes real work.  The audience I saw this with was laughing through the whole thing.  Indeed, it is the type of film that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would appreciate.  The only thing I can think of was that DePalma was trying to parody the conventions of noir: the tough guy detective lead, the voice-over narration, the over-the top acting and dialogue.  The trouble is, it doesn't come off as tongue-in-cheek - it just comes off as bad.  The only actor who really does a good job with her part is Hilary Swank - because she does play it for laughs.",1158364800,5,930,4.244318181818182
1583618,4,B00005JP96,"What can one say, its most assuredly Noir, and in a big way, and that I love Noir.  I loved the style, the characters, the jargon, the hard boiled atmosphere, the period, the cinematography, the scenes and the shots, and the twists, I just can't get past that complex plot, I loved it don't get me wrong, but the plot was just too complex, however I do not think this is a reason to shame this film, I can think  of one other Noir, a Noir heralded as being one of the THE best, that had an incomprehensible plot, one so complex, with so many twists that by the end even the screen writer didn't know who ""done it."" The Big Sleep, so before you condemn this film, please review this past film, and remember that no one alienates this ""classic"" for being incoherent.

Maybe time will tell if de Palma's Dahlia will enter the great film archives, that time will elevate our director, I think it will, how can it not. It always worked for Welles.

Just as a I felt a rebirth of the Zombie genre coming on after 28 Days Later, I too see the rebirth of the Noir in Hollywood, and my oh my what great time it'll be.

One other thing in closing, De Palma really is the scene stealer of Hollywood, he even steals from himself. Did anyone eles notice? If no, and you've not seen it yet, watch for the climactic scene where Lee is going to kill DeWitt, there stair sequence is totally Untouchables train station scene albiet originally from Battleship Potemkin, and the falling shot that follows the stair sequence, totally Scarface and Top Of The World.",1158364800,6,1543,4.381118881118881
1583619,1,B00005JP96,"...in its ineptitude, this ranks right down there with the worst of them (think ""Valley of the Dolls"" noir) in terms of literary adaptations to film.  This project had real promise:  Director Brian DePalma, a genre master and heir apparent to the Hitchcock throne; Hillary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, two of the best young actors around; based on James Ellroy's astoundingly good novel, which in turn was based on events surrounding the 1947 murder of young drifter Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles.

Given the compelling (and gruesome) nature of the source material, not to mention the urban legend status which now surrounds the crime and subsequent investigation, it is unfortunate that absolutely everything about this movie is WRONG:

*Perhaps 10-15 minutes of the 2 hour-plus film deals with the Black Dahlia, the rest is, well, hard to describe...but the word ""camp"" does come to mind.  The Black Dahlia herself is sadly virtually ignored here, as is any relation to actual events or reality. This is an incredibly mean-spirited and vicious mispresprentation of a person who, in reality, was a naive, lost young woman who, though looking for love in ALL the wrong places, wasn't hurting anyone in the process.  Should this representation surprise us though, given the tendency of the media (the press in this case, and now the filmmakers) to once again portray victims as almost deserving of their fate?  As if Elizabeth Short was in any way asking for what happened to her?  How ridiculous is that??

*The less said about the two male leads the better, both are dreadful here (especially Josh Hartnett, miscast and out of his league).  Hillary Swank and Scarlett Johansson (both normally superb) simply look embarassed, as well they should.  And how about that K.D. Lang cameo???  Did John Waters direct this or what????

*James Ellroy's classic novel of L.A. noir has been fed through a wood chipper, eventually emerging transformed into this regrettable, convoluted, and irritating ""screenplay"".  The worst massacre of literary source material since Demi Moore wore the Scarlett Letter.  Woeful adaptation.  Painful in fact.

*Brian De Palma:  what can be said?  He was ostensibly an absolutely perfect director for this material; formerly helming some of the best suspense thrillers of the last 30 years: Sisters, Carrie, Obsession, Dressed to Kill, Body Double, The Untouchables, Scarface, the list goes on.  This film is so uneven in tone it's hard to believe there was even a director present, much less one of De Palma's stature.  It may be time for him to throw in the towel, if this is what it's come to.

Enough.  This was a thorough disappointment on so very many levels it would take pages....but enough.  The only antidote to a poisonously bad film such as this is to watch one which is as good as this was bad.  ""L.A. Confidential"" comes to mind, or ""Chinatown.""  Now THOSE are good movies.",1158364800,3,2912,4.9896265560165975

I get what the writers and the director were trying to accomplish, failed miserably. The movie simply did not keep your attention and the plot was poor.  I will give a four stars for creativity and different approach to this infamous story. I was very disappointed with it. I found it hard to stay awake. The best part about the movie was the last twenty to thirty minutes when the movie finally leads you to what happend according to one persons theory,
