8604449,4,B00EE41S8G,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning. The Jennifer Aniston 4-Movie Spotlight Series was a must have in our collection, especially for $10. This collection features ""The Break Up"", ""Along Came Polly"", ""Love Happens"" and ""Wanderlust."" This was an unbeatable price for great romantic comedies. I had originally been shopping around for the individual disc of ""Wanderlust"", since it is a laugh out loud love story, but this collection was cheaper than the single movie itself. Individually, these movies would have cost a total of almost $30. All of these titles were great to put on and watch while working on our guest list or seating chart. They are a great combination light hearted, laugh out loud funny and serious relationship drama, especially with Jennifer Aniston leading the show. This would make a great gift for any newly engaged couple or a wishing well gift at a bridal shower. I definitely recommend this collection for any soon to be married couple.

My opinion is 100% my own - good or bad. I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the ""helpful"" button!",1475712000,,1315,4.81858407079646
