7913456,5,B00000JSJT,"This series is absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, it has been mislabeled as a hentai, and bundled with other anime porn. Thus it is NOT a hentai. It's an erotic-psychological-drama-romance. Yes, it does have graphic sex scenes in it, but you don't even see anything other than some  breasts. I have seen standard ecchi anime that have been far more graphic.
The story really draws you in. The plot is very deep and really draws you in. The characters are complex and feel real. And the voice actor for the female lead does a stupendous job. You can really hear the emotion in her voice that makes her character feel very realistic. The art is really good, and the director uses it to express beauty, art, and emotion. The only drawback is that half of it is slide-show, but there's a reason for that too, which comes into play at the very end of the last episode, and it is also used to signify important and emotional scenes. Sadly, due to it incorrect hentai label, many people pass over this rare gem, thinking it's just standard anime smut. It's really worth a watch.",1519862400,,1071,4.607329842931938
