8226546,5,B000X1NDPK,"Purchased this as VHS years ago. Loved it so much that I had to purchase it as a DVD.  It is an excellent ab work out that produces excellent results if you use this.  After a only a week of using this DVD I started seeing results and it started to become easier to increase my reps.  I really recommend this DVD to anyone trying to strengthen their abs and trying to get ""tone to the bone""!",1403049600,,391,4.0519480519480515
