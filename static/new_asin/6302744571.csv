7830782,4,6302744571,"Bizarre early '90s Mexican crime melodrama about a kid, the son of police officer Sebastian Ligarde (here in a rare non-bad guy role), who gets a gun and becomes a nighttime vigilante, going around righting wrongs (as he sees them) in his neighborhood, including blowing away other kids!

Eventually Charles Bronson Jr. gets mixed up (in a bad way) with a local gang of hoodlums who like to trash cars and just hang out grooving to Guns 'n' Roses' 'Locomotive' (I bet that wasn't licensed). These guys look like they lost out in the auditions for 'Miami Vice,' i.e. the guys have horrible mullets and ponytails, while the women have blown-out hair, and everyone wears lots of leather and acid-washed denim (classic!). These baddies kidnap the boy's Amazonian mother (tall with a hot body, but also kinda man-faced) and drag her off to a construction site where they're about to rape her when...

Do not reveal the 'ironic' ending and the completely straight-faced pre-end credits scroll citing some ludicrous 'facts' and figures about kids and guns. We get it, we get it: lock up your firearms and store your ammo in a separate locker. Okay, already, jeez...",1349222400,,1158,4.873096446700508
