7887698,4,6305310971,The original Ghostface Killah in the Chinese Kung-fu movie thats a classic! The Myster of Chess boxing is a one of the greats!,1397260800,,126,4.521739130434782
7887699,2,6305310971,"Good kung fu fighting, but repetitive. Ten minutes or so of fun kung fu training. Not as much plot as even the average old school kung fu flick. Dependable entertainment for the aficionado but nothing to recommend it beyond that devoted audience.",1322092800,,246,4.880952380952381
7887700,5,6305310971,I've had it in VHS for years and desperately want it in DVD as I no longer have a working deck. This along with Secret Master and Master Killer are the three of the genre I could watch daily and not tire.,1281398400,,204,3.880952380952381
7887701,4,6305310971,"This has action all the way through - if you walk away you'll miss something!  The dubs were way off in some scenes though! A scene towards the end of the movie was cut off (Martial Arts Theater's Version).  During the scene when Simon Yuen ran to tell his master that the Ghost-faced Killer had killed a teacher from another school, his face was scratched up and he looked liked he suffered a serious beatdown.  But from whom?  You never see this part in the movie.  If scenes are going to be cut out the editors should make sure it wouldn't be missed during the scenes following.  Otherwise, this was very enjoyable and action-filled.  A must have for hardcore old school martial arts fans.

I also agree.  What's up with the title, ""Ninja Checkmate""? No ninjas in sight - not one.  The Mystery of Chess Boxing unfolded during the last fighting scene.  The previous name was better of course.",1123200000,,894,4.559748427672956
7887702,5,6305310971,"This movie is definitely one of the best of the wutang collection. A true Old school Classic.  Mystery of the Chess boxing features the most infamous Kung fu villain ""Ghostface Killer"". The movie has everything you're looking for. Fighting, hilarious comedy, and more fighting. The plot is simple. ""Gostface killer"" hunts down kung fu masters who tried to kill him years ago. He goes on a killing spree with his deadly 5 element kung fu. Great choreographed fights, diplaying many techniques even the Ying Yang style.
Bottom line is, if you are starting a kung fu collection, Mystery of chess boxing should be one of your first purchases.
Best  Quote of the movie: ""I'm a killer thats why, and killers don't die so easily"".",1053907200,3,723,4.82258064516129
7887703,5,6305310971,"I found the mystery of chess boxing to
be one of the best if not the best wu-tang collection you will view . you will not be disappoint with your purchase... A word of advice stay far away from the ku-fu stand in king's plaza mall in Brooklyn nothing but trouble.
  Enjoy the Movie....",1016323200,,285,4.2592592592592595
7887704,3,6305310971,"This movie had me almost coughing up my pizza! However I must warn that it is more along the lines of MST 3000. The fighting-ridiculous, the dubbing- even worse, but trust me this one easily takes the cake in the ""Golden Turkey Award"" category. Definately not a ""Master Killer"" by any means, but well worth the investment for some fun on a rainy day!",995846400,5,350,4.484375
7887705,5,6305310971,"I'd say that about 70 to 80% of this movie is fighting. And it's the  well-choreographed, long, and intense fight scenes that make this an instant classic. Everything you want from an old-skool kung-fu movie, including the ghost-faced killer and his five elements style. The acting and plot are secondary to the insane, non-stop fighting, which got me hooked right away. The DVD isn't the greatest but it's at least as good as the VHS if not slightly better, but who cares; this movie is worth getting for either.",986601600,5,513,4.764044943820225
7887706,4,6305310971,"I saw this movie as a kid, and still had memories of the Ghost faced killer. It is nice to see that classy traditional martial arts movies like this are still in the market. Watch out for ""the five elements"" technique from the Ghost faced Killer (Mark Long).",985305600,,258,4.395833333333333
