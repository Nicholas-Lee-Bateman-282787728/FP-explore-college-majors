8115162,3,B000EWBNRS,"I saw the movie, Interview with the Vampire as a teen and I instantly became a fan of Kirsten Dunst for life.  This played on TV a million years ago it seems.  I thought it would be awful when I got it, but I just had to see it once more.  I have to admit, it really was a lot of over acting, but if you are a fan you won't care.  I still liked it, I just know she can do better.",1371600000,,379,3.5301204819277108
