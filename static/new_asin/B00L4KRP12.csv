6466401,2,B00L4KRP12,"They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, and by the time Think Like A Man Too is over you'll wish it had stayed there, also. Following up on 2011's surprise comedy hit based on the relationship book by Steve Harvey, the film leans heavily on breakout star Kevin Hart to carry the comedic load, to the detriment of the equally-talented cast he's surrounded by. Not to say that Hart isn't talented as well, but as a colleague of mine put it, ""A little Hart goes a long way"". It's the classic case of a sequel that's bigger but not necessarily better, louder but not necessarily funnier.

Admit it, the first time you heard Vegas would be the setting you knew the sequel was doomed. Vegas has become something of a black hole from which fresh ideas never escape. The only one to break this disturbing trend was The Hangover, which then proceeded to return to Vegas disastrously in the franchise's finale. Overconfidence will kill ya. But the worst side-effect of the Vegas problem is the locale guarantees there will be less relationship insight and more indulging in the night life.

Everybody's back for what turns out to be a big wedding bash in Sin City, only now their respective relationships have been kicked up to sitcom levels. Candace (Regina Hall) has settled into a comfortable groove with her fianc Michael (Terrence J), who is still a ""momma's boy"" and perhaps even more so. Mya (Meagan Good) is having issues dealing with ""Zeke the Freak"" (Romany Malco) and his sexual history, made worse by his reputation around Vegas. Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) and Dominic (Michael Ealy) are having work/life balance issues; Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kirsten (Gabrielle Union) are trying to maintain their passion while trying to get pregnant, and of course the requisite unhip white couple (Gary Owen and Wendi McLendon-Covey) is along for the ride and get spruced up roles. Aggressive motormouth Cedric (Hart) has a wild bachelor party planned and a $40K-per-night hotel all booked up for the festivities, hilariously mistaken into thinking he's been asked by Michael to be the best man. Making fun of Hart's diminutive stature has become all too common, but director Tim Story finds new ways to emphasize his lack of height. Cedric, who narrates the action as he did before, sees it as a competition between the sexes to have the craziest evening possible, frequently and weakly reaching for basketball metaphors to make his point. They were probably lifted word-for-word from Harvey's book, but on the plus side the author's appearances are thankfully few.

Hart gets the bulk of the funniest lines as Cedric berates his friends and their love lives, racing them from one disastrous mishap after another. Im sick of this nontourage"", he cleverly quips. You can't blame them for making Hart the centerpiece but his rat-a-tat-tat shtick has a limit, and you don't know when the line has been crossed until it's too late. In one tell-tale moment, Hart indulges in a Risky Business-style dance number that goes on way too long and would have been funnier as a shared scene with the group. The ensemble is what audiences love, and they will absolutely flip over the film's creative highlight; a music video of the ladies rappin' to Bell Biv Devoe's ""Poison"". From there it's all downhill for Think Like a Man Too, a sequel that, if we were to use a relationship metaphor, is like a really bad rebound date.",1403222400,,3410,4.835616438356165

Most of the scenes that are supposed to be funny are truly hilarious and the scenes that are supposed to be touching hit their marks.

6466642,2,B00L4KRP12,"I love a good love story - especially one with some comedy and some tender moments. This movie had potential, but fell very short on hitting any of those aspects. There is some sprinkling of love stories for each couple throughout, but they don't develop then well enough for the viewer to really connect with the (very brief) tender moments at the end. The worst part of the movie is how over the top they made Kevin Hart's role. He was no only annoying to the other characters, but so annoying to the viewer that I had to resist turning the movie off several times. It really took away from the movie and minimized the effectiveness of the other characters. I wonder why the writer and director didn't leverage all of the characters' strengths in this movie. Very disappointing.
I should mention that I did watch the first in this sequence, and while not a favorite for me, it did a much better job developing the love story and finding a balance between Kevin Hart's character and the other actors and actresses.",1448668800,,1015,4.582417582417582

6466702,5,B00L4KRP12,"Rarely does a sequel reach the quality of the initial movie, but Think Like A Man Too provided us with as many laughs as the first movie.

This time the entire cast goes to Vegas for Michael and Candace's wedding. Between the antics that the guys attempt to pull and the overpowering (and super controlling) behavior of Michael's Mom, Loretta (played to perfection by Jenifer Lewis), things go awry pretty quickly and it's pretty much a downhill slide for everyone from there! Oh, and ladies, that tall-drink-of-water, Dennis Haysbert, reprises his role as ""Uncle Eddie,"" distracting Loretta (and me ;-)) to perfection.

The story also picks up with where all of the couples are at, which makes it more interesting. Needless to say, Kevin Hart is at the center of the laughs but the cast, (especially Zeke - of ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and Jeremy - of ""Entourage"") once again, enhance the laughs. Too few ""romantic comedies"" that will appeal to both women and men available these days but this movie and, it's predecessor, make the perfect 'date night' movie.

Be SURE to watch the original movie (Think Like A Man) first though as it is hilarious and will help you to appreciate this sequel even more.",1432512000,3,1198,4.777777777777778

This time the gals have the floor and so does mama, the laughter is there and not overdone, worth a look see and forming your own opinion. If you liked the first one this will appeal to you just as much. Now if you didn't like the first than don't waste your time and money. I rated this an A grade plus for the ideas and the funny sides of both marriage and single that can just happen, Now I have told you very little about this show but why should it be spoiled by telling it all. Now it's your turn to get a move on, pick up this movie collect the popcorn and drinks for a fabulous night in with a fantastic show that entertainment can only provide in your own living room.

I'm hoping for something good to happen. Normally I love him, but here, Kevin Hart is childish and obnoxious, and the soon to be mother-in-law ruins the first half. The star girls dancing in the club was cute, for a minute. The whole movie It's as if they spliced together pieces and showed a few seconds of fun in many places. Even though I'm  still waiting for it to happen, it was nice to see George Wallace for a minute--look carefully. I just muted it--they put Kevin Hart as a little, bratty kid, and I can't hear any more whining. What a disappointment.

6466848,3,B00L4KRP12,I love Kevin Hart but this movie was all Kevin Hart. I was looking for all the characters I fell in love with in the first one & was disappointed they had such a secondary role. And there was no point for Michael's mother in this movie at all. She was just a distraction that did nothing to further the plot. I think there could be a 3rd one if they go back & develop the couples more.,1420416000,,385,3.948717948717949

6467168,3,B00L4KRP12,"Think Like a Man Too was just as crazy as the first film.  All the couples are back this time for a wedding in Las Vegas.  When does anything go right in Las Vegas because plans for a romantic weekend go wrong and they go on some interesting adventures that get them into some very complicated situations that could ruin the wedding.  The screenplay for this film was written by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman while the film was directed by Tim Story who is known for directing such films as Fantastic Four, Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and Think Like a Man.

In this highly anticipated sequel, which was inspired by Steve Harvey's best-selling book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, you have all the couples back for Candace (Regina Hall) and Micheal's (Terrence Jenkin) wedding which is in Las Vegas.  Things would be great but thanks to a misunderstanding you have Cedric (Kevin Hart) as the best man instead of Dominic (Michael Ealy)  That's where things start to get interesting because nobody wants to do what he want's to do and it just frustrates him so much.  That is when that get to a club and you meet Michael's buddy's known for partying.  Isaac (Adam Brody) and Terrell (David Walton) are crazier than Cedric and something about it bothers him.  They all decide to go gambling and everyone does a decent job except Cedric which just angers him even more.

On the girl's side of things Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) is in charge of  the bachelorette party but Micheal's mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) makes it virtually impossible to have a traditional party.  The other girls Mya (Meagan Good) Kristen (Gabrielle Union) find a way to get Candace out of the boring party and into a night of craziness, but not before inviting the final girl Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey) to join them.  As they are all in Vegas... things go downhill from there.

This film is not like the first one where it was based on the book written by Steve Harvey.  This is just taking the characters from that and throwing them into a crazy ""Hang Over-ish"" situation just because it's Vegas.  The chemistry is there because like the first film they worked well together in this second film.  Granted I don't think this film should have been made because they seemed to just take stories from other films mashed them together and then threw these characters in it to give you this film.  I don't know what it is about the narration of the film but I find that annoying in films... I am not at a school play don't narrate things for me!

Overall I would have to give this no better than I did the first one, though it isn't a complete failure because it was enjoyable to watch.  That would be a C- for this time around.  Lets hope they don't make a Let's Think Like A Man Three.

6467230,3,B00L4KRP12,"There are good and bad sequels being made all the time. It seems that Hollywood is unwilling to bank on something new and more prone to take on remakes and sequels more and more. So if you choose to go see a sequel my guess is your hoping that it's good. I can say now that THINK LIKE A MAN TOO is indeed a good sequel.

The men and women from the first film are brought back again, this time to celebrate the wedding of two of their own. Michael (Terrence Jenkins) and Candace (Regina Hall) are about to tie the knot and with Cedric (Kevin Hart) as his best man you know things won't turn out as planned. The first problem they encounter is Michael's interfering mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis), a woman who is controlling all aspects of the wedding from start to finish. Vegas may not have been her first choice for location but she's making it this wedding as un-Vegas as she can.

But this group of friends has other plans in mind for the night before. While the tried and true plot device of a bachelor party gone wild has been used over and over again, this movie at least puts a new spin on it that works. Rather than just have the fellas out and about visiting strip club after strip club, we end up with two groups setting out to outdo one another. Narrating it from start to finish is Cedric.

The men start out in the lead doing the things they planned in the hotel at one of the most expensive suites available. Of course when Cedric booked it he thought the cost was only $4,000. What he failed to notice is that the ad he read said it was $4,000 off. With that discount the costs is a mere $40,000 per night. As the night progresses things only continue this way.

The women are having a tough time getting off the ground as well. It seems that Loretta has the entire evening planned on her own, starting with dinner at a fancy restaurant and then on to seeing Dionne Warwick in concert. To the rescue comes the bride's uncle Eddie (Dennis Haysbert), someone that Michael's mom took a liking to once before. With her out of the way the race is on.

A mix up results in the girls getting the bus that Cedric booked for the evening leaving the guys with a limo painted with male strippers on the side. Rather than take that ride, they walk instead. As they walk they talk with one another about the various problems each one is facing. That's one of the things that makes this movie work more than most. It's not just the raunch that this evening is about, it's about friendship and the affection they have for their significant others as well as one another.

One couple is facing possible career changes that may take them to opposite sides of the country. Another is facing the daunting task of trying to get pregnant and worried about what that entails. A third faces the problems of dealing with the guy's party animal past and his girlfriend's confusion as to whether this is a man she wants to spend her life with. All of these difficulties come to a solution before the end of the film, a lot like the old romantic comedies of the 50s and 60s. The thing that makes it stand out is the journey they take along the way there.

At this time Hart is perhaps the biggest name in the cast. So many stand up comedians always start to make movies and take over the whole thing while at the same time just doing the same character they do in their stand up. Hart does the smart thing though and shares the screen with the entire cast here. Not only that while he may portray a character that's a bit shallow and misguided, that may go off on the rest from time to time, he never makes the movie about himself. It's about the entire group. That's a nice change to see.

There are plenty of laughs as the movie progresses from start to finish with the best held in check till the final third of the film. But that works here. Prior to that we have to set up exactly what is going on with these people. It makes the rest of the film that much more special by the end. While they might end up in some crazy situations, it makes you wish that you had a group of friends around you as close as this group is. Now to wait and see if a third film in the series comes along. With babies being discussed it would be the next step and could make it a wonderful trilogy to watch.",1411948800,4,4277,4.245700245700245

This movie was mostly just a bunch of men and women trying to act crazy in Vegas at their bachelor and bachelorette parties.  We have all the mandatory things we see in movies with these parties in them.  We have strip clubs, money problems, problems with future in-laws, and conflict between friends that is resolved in 90 minutes.

Overall the acting isn't bad.  But the shining stars of this movie, to me, are Kevin Hart and Romany Malco, the other actors are just kinda there to take up space.  The plot is pretty standard for these movies and we all know where the movie and the characters are going to end up.

6467362,3,B00L4KRP12,"""I'm gonna give you the perfect weekend. Nothing is going to go wrong."" The gang from the first movie are all back but this time they are in Vegas for the wedding of Michael and Candace. Cedric (Hart) is the best man and wants everything to go perfect so he rents a hotel room, reserves a party bus and has the entire night planned out. Things for the ladies are planned out and everything is starting off smooth and easy. Things quickly start to unravel when the hotel room turns out to be more than expected, two of them get job offers and Cedric starts to lose more money then he wanted to but nothing compares to what Miss Loretta has planned. I have said many times that how much you like a movie depends about 80% on expectations. If you think a movie will be garbage and it wasn't you say you like it. If you are super excited about seeing it and it wasn't as good as you thought you say it wasn't that good. This movie is in the third classification...exactly what you expect. I remember seeing the first one and thought it was pretty funny but didn't need a sequel. I do have to say though that since it was was I expected it wasn't terrible. I may be in the minority in this but I do not think that Kevin Hart is all that funny. He seems to try to hard and just yells a lot. I know a lot of people like him and is the reason that many people will watch this but for me the movie would have been better without him. The movie would be moving along smooth and begin to develop the plot then Kevin Hart would jump in screaming and slow the movie down. Almost all of his scenes seemed to distract from the flow of the movie. If you liked the first one and are a fan of the Why Did I Get Married series than you will most likely like this one. Overall, exactly what I was expecting. I thought it was OK but not really a sequel that was needed and would have been better without Kevin Hart. I give it a B-.",1410739200,,1910,4.068965517241379

The Zeke bit of him having been there before and knowing all the women didn't work well and I found myself growing bored with Kevin Hart pretending to be funny jumping on beds and dancing in his underwear.

6467387,3,B00L4KRP12,"In Kevin Harts final film of the year, I don't even think you can argue that the man isn't over exposed. Not only that, but he seems so geared toward his Big Little Man persona that it really does make it so moments which would have been funny when he first got big, now they have lost their luster. But with so much talent packed in the film, does the cast find a way to make up for Harts overzealous performance?

Characters & Story

The cast is back together for Candace (Regina Hall) and Michaels (Terrence J) wedding. But, there are so many things which may derail their celebration. Be it Michaels momma Ms. Loretta (Jenifer Lewis), Cedrics (Kevin Hart) incompetence, or the personal drama of the groomsmen or even the bridesmaids. For between Maya (Meagan Good) and Zekes (Romany Malco) issues of his time as a philanderer; Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) trying to get pregnant, unsuccessfully; Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji O. Henson) both having to decide whether to choose love or their career; or even Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and Bennett (Gary Owen) simply trying to be the good example of a functioning marriage, there is a lot of topics covered, a lot of drama to go through, and the question dangling in the air: Will all the couples survive?

Praise

Though Hart naturally is the one which delivers the majority of the laughs, he does share the spotlight quite a bit. Owen, for example, plays his own shtick quite well with being the awkward white guy, and McLendon-Covey definitely sets herself apart from the bachelorette side of the film. But, to me, most of the praise definitely goes to Lewis, Henson, Hall, and Union. Those four women, to me, are what make this film worth watching. For not only are they funny, but they somehow sculpt themselves actual human characters. Ones which have complex thoughts and feelings, and seriously give you a reason, besides being funny, to invest in them.

Criticism

But when it comes to the story of Think Like a Man Too, as with the first film, there isn't any insightful comments about love nor are there a lot of genuine moments between characters which may make you go aw! If anything, each relationship feels shallow due to the attempt to give equal focus to each relationship. Not only that, most of the cast I feel don't rise above being eye candy. If just because not everyone in the film has comedic talent, and for those who dont, they remind you that this film perhaps was solely made in hopes of repeating the success of the first film, financially, but without trying to really improve the quality.

Overall: TV Viewing

The film as a whole is decent enough and won't lead you to checking your watch, but at the end of the day it is the type of film which seems to not pursue being any type of classic. If anything, the product screams all involved trying to cash in on the first films success, and putting in the least amount of effort in the process. Which isn't to say the story is horrible, nor the actors, but when it comes to sequels you just expect progress and things getting better, and while it does for a handful of characters, the rest remain stagnant to the point I felt like the cast was too bloated. Hence why Im labeling this as a TV Viewing type film. It will make you laugh, it made me 30 times to be exact, but it fails to give compelling insight into any of the relationships, and generally seems hardly invested in the majority of the characters really proving why they deserved to have their stories followed up on.

Things to Note

Drake makes a comical appearance in the film and shares a scene with Wendy Williams.",1403654400,,3649,4.6

6467389,4,B00L4KRP12,"This time we're off to Las Vegas for a wedding, but even if the location is changed, the people are still the same. This PG-13 comedy based on Steve Harvey's best seller ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment,"" is another predictable chapter in the misadventures of a group of long-time friends. This DVD plus the original from Amazon will make a set.

Co-written by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman (""Think Like a Man"") and directed by Tim Story (""Think Like a Man"") these appealing folks make us laugh all over again.

We have:
  * Michael Ealy (""Think Like a Man"") still does a bit of dreaming... ...and self employed now. He doesn't want to see ""Jersey Boys"" while they are in Vegas.
  * Taraji P. Henson (""Think Like a Man"") Our career woman has success staring her right in the face!
  * Romany Malco (""Think Like a Man"") This smooth operator keeps encountering old flames, but the heat he feels is not what he expects.
  * Meagan Good (""Think Like a Man"") How many of his former ""flings"" must she meet? Grrr...
  * Jerry Ferrera (""Think Like a Man"") Has our overgrown boy finally grown up? The idea of being a father is terrifying, though.
  * Gabrielle Union (""Think Like a Man"") has earned the right to be married...and to be a mother.
  * Terrence Jenkins (""Think Like a Man"") His mother is still looking out for him; in fact she took the adjoining suite in that Vegas hotel. Watch her take control of the bachelorette party.
  * Regina Hall (""Think Like a Man"") is stuck with TWO boys to raise, unless her prospective groom grows up...really FAST!
  * Kevin Hart (""Think Like a Man"") See how he becomes Best Man!
  * Wendy Williams (Think Like a Man) has her ex...at least on her speed dial.
  * Gary Owen (""Think Like a Man"") They don't want him to play the slots! He DOES want to see ""Jersey Boys.""
  * Wendy McLendon-Covey (""Bridesmaids"") should NOT wear a sweater set to a bachelorette party!
  * Dennis Haysbert (""Dear White People"") tries to distract the mother-of-the-groom.
  * Jenifer Lewis (""Think Like a Man"") is in Vegas to derail the wedding between her cherished son and ""that woman!""

Our screening audience had a great time! I heard unanimous reactions; hoots of laughter, roars of approval and groans of dismay, all right on cue. The final melee is waaay over the top; I LOVED the mug shots!

Artistic merit? Nah... Entertainment? You bet!",1403222400,16,2439,4.587006960556844

I really enjoyed the first film and when I heard about a sequel I was excited to check it out. I later learned that it would be set in Vegas and I knew it would be good, Kevin Hart in Vegas, I love it. The entire cast returned as did the original writers and director Tim Story. So all of the players were in place and I was sure I would enjoy it.

The gang is back in business and this time they are headed to Vegas for a wedding, what wedding you ask? Michael and Candace are getting married and each team this time [guys vs. girls] are trying to have the better stag night. Its bachelors versus the bachelorettes to see who can have the better night out on the town.

This was a fun movie and even more so than the first flick. That Poison scene and the strip club scene are excellent and had me cracking up. The script and direction are great and of course the cast is amazing. The Blu-Ray comes with some great special features even though once again we get no commentary.
