8255885,2,6305223149,"Pretty average likely made for TV movie, it even has Alexandra Paul (formerly in Bay Watch) in it who seems to have been contracted to make a heap of these low quality/budget TV movies and whose name is used on the cover to get you to buy them since she's the only actor you've heard of. Of course her acting ability isn't that great and she ridiculously smiles all the time. This is one of those criminals are klutzy dimwitted villains, sort of like the ones in Home Alone but not as well written and more cheesy/cartoon like. It's a kid outwits the adults who of course don't listen to his warnings of what is going down.  Peter (the kid) is obsessed with real life police action, his dead before events in the film father used to be a cop, so he hangs out at the police station and pretty much acts like one every opportunity he gets.  Of course his mother (Alexandra Paul) doesn't think this is a good idea.

This is no Cop and a Half or of the quality of other kids outwit the bad guys type movies.",1451779200,,1003,4.2408376963350785
8255886,1,6305223149,"I have tried hard to find any point in this movie, except for the fact to tell kids that its cool to be a cop.  Not the type of movie to rent for your family, if you actually want to get something for the whole family out of the film medium.  This is a perfect example of why most family movies in the 90s are no good; no ineteresting storyline, no good kid acting and a dry plot that puts cops on a ledge.  If you want good famliy entertainment turn back to the 80s Goonies, Gremlins, ET and The Flight of the Navigator are a perfect place to start.",1013299200,3,550,3.981818181818182
