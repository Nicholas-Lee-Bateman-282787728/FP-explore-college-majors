4689885,3,B005G7WGJA,Movie is a slow starter and takes a long time to get to gist of the story and I shut it off and savrd for future viewing!,1389139200,,121,3.5185185185185186
4689886,1,B005G7WGJA,"This movie was rated high in other places, but it is definitely a one star movie. The kind of low budget movie that you don't want to show at a ""bad movie"" party. I won't even touch how bad the script was because after the first 3 minutes, it's a given that the entire plot makes no sense.

The acting was really bad. There were three vocal ranges from everyone...indifference, bored robot and reading an excerpt from a book in front of your 6th grade classmates. I will say I understand why there weren't a lot of zombies even being shown, because the make up artist did a horrible horrible job. Not only on the brother, but on the zombies too.  Sarah, Charlie, Sarah, Charlie calling these names over and over again throughout the movie.

So many questions needed answering. NOW you need water? What did you do for the first year? What's with the dog killing, what are you saving that blood for, why is now a great time to leave, what's with the chickens, who's playing that piano music and can we pay them to stop?

Kudos for the small touches like putting a bunch of dried dead grass under the handle of the car door so we could really feel that a lot of time had passed (hopefully my sarcasm here translates) but never boarding up a window.

Booooo",1387929600,22,1253,4.383620689655173
4689887,1,B005G7WGJA,"For me, the movie was terrible enough, that I didn't even catch but 3 minutes, here and there, of it, in the beginning.. I left the room, off and on, while it was playing. . came back in and once [spoiler alert] ....

he killed the dog, I was done. I re-read what the movie was about, and turned it back on to see if this, gesh, I can't think of any other word to call him besides a cussword, but I wanted to see if he would die, so it's playing now. I will admit, I am not watching it nor listening to it, I'm just waiting to see if the guys die.

That. Is. All.

oh .. and the other reviews were so funny!! :)

What makes this movie terrible:
-Acting (the girl was ok, but the two guys seemed like they were reading from cue cards. it was robotic)

-Direction (seemed like the directors first time, ever)

-Editing (good)

-Script (I cannot see how this made it to production - why did they have to have them say their names in repetition? We know who they are by now and they also know who they are, seeing they're the only two people around at the time. It's exhausting and sickening. You're rooting for someone to knock them over the heads, to get them to stop stuttering.)

-Sound (terrible - at one point in the movie, she is saying his name over and over, talking to him, him to her, like she is right beside him (due to the sound being terrible it seemed that way) and she was in the car the whole time, many feet away. So it was a sound dub - which was terribly done.

All in all, this movie was terrible. I give less than 1 star- I know my B Horror (which I would place this there, if anywhere, and it doesn't even belong there) ...and this movie, I'm still shocked it made it to production with these actors - guess they didn't want to lose the 5 grand they sunk into it, to make it. For it being a 2011 movie, this should of been a lot better. (they saved on cast! that's a plus! too bad they couldn't act and everything else in between wrong with this thing.)

IMDb gives it 3.8 stars.",1372982400,,1999,4.0636132315521625

4689892,5,B005G7WGJA,I really enjoyed this low budget horror flick. It was also just given a really positive review from AintItCoolNews [],1321228800,3,117,4.9
4689893,1,B005G7WGJA,"Story consists of a couple of hissing sounds (Do zombies hiss?) and shadows followed by the remains of a killed chicken followed by Halloween costumed spot local actors walking like they have something stuck up their (you know where). Why do zombies always have to move like that? Is it a trademark issue that the Zombie Union requires? Finally, the two non-zombies drive off in their 4wdr to find a non-zombie only community. That's it - end of movie. Oh, isn't that a violation of federal anti-discrimination laws? Most attorneys are sort-of zombie like anyway so the zombies shouldn't have any trouble finding counsel.

The highlight of the film was Molly the dog whose acting performance of sitting and looking sad for about five seconds of screen time overwhelmed her human acting cohorts.
Next highlight is that the movie is thankfully short. One hour in length - phew.

The lowlight of this film was the incessant repetition of about 7 piano notes played over and over and over and so loud that it even drowned out the dialogue - for the whole movie! An annoyingly cheap mechanism to create emotional tension - I think.
Next lowlight was the poor audio quality which made the slower than molasses-in-winter dialogue unintelligible - too cheap to have subtitles to help either.",1318982400,3,1283,4.8807339449541285

4689906,4,B005G7WGJA,"I don't understand the low reviews as this a low / no budget indie film not a hollywood production. I don't expect this to be a classic or to have the best CGI or A list talent. I found it interesting - a tale of survival in the zombie apocalypse. More a specifically a tale of survival when a survivalists best laid plans don't live up to expectations, and knowing when to say when. Basically you have two brothers living on their dads farm / survival retreat. One has had enough, the other will never give up. An interesting approach to the question of ""do you actually WANT to survive the Zombie Apocalypse?"" Its not packed with action, or great acting, or the best special effect - but its an interesting story which for free on Prime was well worth watching. Frankly - it was better than anything I have seen so far on this season of ""The formerly best show on TV"". If you have to pay to watch it - eh make up your own mind, but with a prime membership what do you have to lose its free? Just approach it knowing its ""low budget"" and its a study of survival psychology and interpersonal relationships NOT nail biting zombie action.",1480377600,,1136,4.338028169014085

4689910,4,B005G7WGJA,"Unlike a lot of the reviews here, I genuinely liked this movie. It isn't great cinematic art, but it is solid storytelling, and that is movie making at its core...let's start with the bad parts...acting is fairly stilted, and dialogue pedantic...special effects/makeup are definitely nothing to write home about...having said that, the storyline/plot that so many decry as being a detraction are actually one of this movie's strong points. It is a small story, a glimpse through a window at a world that could be...it isn't overly ambitious, which is much to the movie makers' credit...far too often movies bite off more than can be swallowed, and substitute CGI/FX for a good story...a small tale told well is far better than a grand epic done poorly. At least with little projects like this the audience is given credit for having at least a modicum of intelligence. The music, and the general theme of the project deliver a somber sense of melancholia...the grinding routine, the grim task of feeding everyone...and the loneliness...not a thriller by any means, but a solid effort nonetheless...",1478995200,2,1098,5.071823204419889

However between the bad acting, the terrible script, the oh so slow pace and the almost endless piano music in the background I am now officially a zombie! This movie is so bad I'm not sure where to begin. Perhaps the ending would be a good place to start because I fast forwarded to the end and it's just as bad as the rest of this movie. Honestly it's not just the acting or the plot if that's what you want to call it that makes this movie unwatchable it's the piano music. It almost never stops throughout the entire movie. The piano music is  so maddening I'm listening to my own music now just to try and get this piano music out of my head! I don't mind piano music actually I like it but not when it sounds as if the piano is being played by a cat running across the keys. I fast forwarded six times to get through this thing, I didn't miss much because there is nothing worth missing. I have feeling whoever dreamed up this movie was also the same person playing the piano (unless it really was a cat) and trust me they stink at both!",1456358400,2,1129,4.155251141552512
4689926,1,B005G7WGJA,"Yikes, this was bad. Some of the worst acting on Amazon, Netflix or Hulu. Perhaps it was the director's fault, maybe he told everyone to portray their characters as robotic, lifeless flat-liners. The worst was the male lead. Now I don't think it was entirely his fault but his character was just a doom and gloom, uber-negative personality. I think he was trying to be dark and enigmatic, but he became just the kind of-wet blanket person who could have bummed-out the crowd dancing in the streets of London after the Nazi surrender. Sets the mood for the whole film. Bad thing that he didn't die in the end which leaves open the most terrifying part of all - a sequel!",1449619200,3,669,4.537190082644628

Other than that, there isn't much substance to this film, but the central theme is about survival , tenacity, hope, faith, all that kind of good stuff. This was a more intelligent and thoughtful approach to what I generally consider to be a completely incomprehensible and asinine cinematic fad.

The woman was completely useless and unnecessary. The scene of the parting of the brothers would have been more powerful and poignant without her. You only needed the two brothers, like in a well written play, two playing off each other; much more powerful than a cast of thousands type of production.

A single piano provides the background music throughout most of the movie, and in many ways,  the piano was the best character in the show.  When the piano went to a crescendo,  the ""undead"" were coming up the hill and everyone was in danger.  When the music went down to a diminuendo, the scenes were often the flashbacks to the happy memories of the family.
Unlike, say ""World War Z"", the special effects budget in this movie was almost nil.  There were nice shots of the farm and the country  side, but no cars crashing into each other or bombs blowing up....  The make-up attempts were limited to a few characters to show the effects of the disease, which is not really explained. It was enough that everyone was sick, except on the ""FARM"".
