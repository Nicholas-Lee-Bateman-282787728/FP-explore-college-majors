8199413,3,B000R7I4AE,This is a good production which I saw on PBS one evening.  The PBS pric was about $25 more than the Aazon price  Everyting went well with tis purchase.,1357084800,,151,4.172413793103448
8199414,2,B000R7I4AE,"For those of you looking for something in the mold of Planet Earth, Life of Mammals, and Life in the Freezer, you are going to be deeply disappointed. The first 20 minutes of the feature is a lecture on global warming, with excessive amounts of coverage of humans studying the arctic ice. The second half actually features ""the Masters of the Arctic Ice"", but the narration seems more interested in rambling about climate change than actually providing insight as to what is occurring with the animals. If you are a fan of stern global warming lectures, you will love this. If you actually wanted to learn about the animals, there are easily a dozen better DVDs you should view first.

This is a true shame, as it has some of the best film yet of seal and polar bear dens. However, I can't tolerate political lectures when I merely want to study animal behavior and interaction.",1238457600,6,878,4.628205128205129
8199415,5,B000R7I4AE,"Hey, what can you say!  Polar bears, National Geographic.....two of my great loves!  You can't ask for more.  Infomative, beautiful....perfect!",1202169600,3,143,6.05
8199416,3,B000R7I4AE,"Don't let the cover deceive you: this was about seals and narwhals.  Polar bears are mentioned, but not extensively.  I wonder if National Geographic wants to piggyback off of ""Arctic Tale,"" both in title and cover.  Additionally, the special features section has a documentary on killer whales that could hold its own and is not a teaser.  It differs in that it takes place in Norway, not the Arctic, and doesn't have an overt environmental message, but it's equally worth watching.

Though the work has two foci, it says more about seals than about narwhals.  The work captures underwater scenes that must have been difficult to take.  The narrator tries to valorize the researchers by talking about what little time they have and how a polar bear came close to their camp.  I thank the researchers, of course, but this touch of ""Indiana Jones"" hype also rubbed me the wrong way.  If it's so cold in the Arctic, I am surprised that the researchers often wear the light clothing that we in the lower 48 wear all the time in the winter.

The important environmental message here is that these mammals depend on the Arctic ice and they could die out within a century if humans don't do something about global warming.  They got this point across without making me feel hopeless.  When internet sites show baby walruses and seals that are going to drown, I feel pain that doesn't inspire me to action.  However, this work made me feel that there is a ray of hope and that viewers can be empowered to tackle the terrible problem of global warming.

This work is really one slice of a large pie.  The destruction of cold-weather mammals is one reason to fight global warming, but there are others that hit humans directly.  I heard that the depletion of the ozone became a big deal because the rich nation of Australia showed how other countries' trashing of the ozone is increasing skin cancer among its citizens.  Others have said that if the globe keeps warming up, whole islands of people will have to move elsewhere.  This documentary doesn't touch on these direct issues, but hopefully it can inspire viewers to keep looking into this tragedy.",1201824000,13,2145,4.705093833780161
