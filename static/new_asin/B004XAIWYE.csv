8446576,4,B004XAIWYE,This is a nice set for fans who would like to start converting DVD to their Blu-Ray Collection. I was a little disappointed that the quality was not as clear as I thought it would be. It is still much better than the DVD's. I'm wondering if Modern Family was not shot in HD? But all and all not bad for the price.,1418256000,,313,3.984126984126984
