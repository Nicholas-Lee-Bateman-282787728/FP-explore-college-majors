1231551,5,B00000J2KA,"I found this movie totally funny and adorable!  Very tastefully done, especially concerning the well-being of the children.
Thought-provoking?  YES!  Afterall, as a mother of one, I often find myself wondering what my  14-month-old son is babbling about.  After seeing this movie, I TRULY  wonder about it!  The old turkish theory that all children are born with  the knowledge of the universe, but forget when they ""cross over""  into the contemporary speaking world is truly mind-boggling.  This movie  took that theory to the extreme, and did it tastefully!  Something many  film makers fail to do!

1231553,1,B00000J2KA,"As a person who never gets offended at anything, I must admit that this film offended me. Rude, crude, dull, and unfunny, it also borders on child pornography in several scenes. The acting is over the top at every turn,  especially Kathleen Turner who clearly needs to fire her agent for this  one. More than the film however, I am frightened by the fact that I live in  a world in which this pile of waste made $20 million and people have  claimed to laugh! If this is humorous, what isn't? Not for adults, not for  children.....not even for those so desperate for distraction on a dull  Saturday night that they would consider deliberate pain and suffering.",932860800,5,659,4.589743589743589

If you want compled movie this isn't it if you want a little bit of a laugh of movie that doesn't require thinking this is a good one. Why I enjoyed this is because they have understanding the film creators of childhood amnesia which rugrsts nd look who's talking to failed to grasp.

This movie is just plain dull, pointless, worthless hunk of garbage, Christopher Lloyd doesn't look like himself, Kathleen Turner's performance is awful, and yes even Dom Deluise's (May he RIP) performance was bad. I hate this movie so much that anybody who dislikes this movie should make a ""Movies that I hate"" list, because there are many bad movies out there that are horrendous and I just found out that there is a ""Baby Geniuses 3"", which is a direct-to-DVD release and Jon Voight (who is a good actor) is in that one. I'm not sure which ""Baby Geniuses"" movie is worse. Either this one or ""Superbabies aka ""Baby Geniuses 2.""

1231626,1,B00000J2KA,"there's a definite (and obvious) downside to being a movie buff: you get constant evidence that creativity is a hit-and-miss affair, that there's no such thing as perfection of talent. there's certainly IMperfection of talant, and plenty of it. you frequently hear about actors or directors whose work always sucks, but when did you last hear of someone who hit the jackpot with every single effort? not even Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg can claim as much.
BABY GENIUSES is hardly a film with a myriad of admirers, and it's not hard to see why. i have to agree with Roger Ebert, who says that the film is most significant because it proves conclusively once and for all that babies are, quote, ""cute,"" unquote, they achieve that just-eat-'em-up level of adorable commonly attributed to them, only in the character of babies!! babies portrayed as miniature businessmen or fashion models or pimps or whatever...well, let's just say i wouldn't be a bit surprised to learn the notion comes from the same genius who brought you sweaters for dogs!
so it's certainly not an overrated film like, say, FORREST GUMP. so why should i feel the need to write about it? because it amply demonstrates the phenomenon mention in the first paragraph, wherein just because participants have talent doesn't give us any guarantees, and it does so with a bang!! not content to sully the resumes of master thespians like Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, and Dom DeLuise, this stink-bomb had to be directed by Bob Clark!!
as it happens Clark directed not one but two of the films i would be most bummed out to be somehow denied any opportunity to ever see again. the most obvious would be A CHRISTMAS STORY, little Ralphie's quest for that Red Ryder BB gun. (actually three, if you count the almost, but not quite, lost in the shuffle sequel, MY SUMMER STORY.) the other (admittedly more obscure) masterwork is MURDER BY DECREE, which stylishly sets Sherlock Holmes on the trail of Jack The Ripper.
but on the other hand, alas, Clark also directed such embarassments as that heir to ANIMAL HOUSE's throne, PORKY'S. (how is it possible, or fair, or LEGAL, for both PORKY'S and BABY GENIUSES to have sequels?) what's more, early works like BLACK CHRISTMAS and CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS have earned Clark the dubious distinction of being named one of the architects of my least favorite style of film, the slasher.
so BABY GENIUSES irks me for most of the obvious reasons, but with a bonus. you frequently hear people ask ""How could [talented person] have possibly thought [terrible movie/tv series project] was worth it?"" well, like it or not, they sometimes do, and hideous duds like this are the result.
it's oft been said that when it comes to a given movie, tv series, book, band, whatever, ""you either get it or you don't."" the implication here is if that you don't like it, it's because you don't ""get"" it. well, here's at least one time where the big problem is that we do get it. we get it all too clearly.
i know of one, and only one, approving review of this film, specifically the one blurbed on the box calling it a ""live action RUGRATS."" well, personally, i never wanted a cartoon RUGRATS, either.",1340582400,4,3210,4.764811490125673

1231629,1,B00000J2KA,"""Baby Geniuses"" represents the second lowest point in the late Bob Clark's directorial career, right behind ""Superbabies"".  It's a terrible idea on paper, and its quality didn't change in its filming execution.  The film tells me that it's alright for toddlers (not babies as the title mislead) to perform implausible acts in situations made for them, dumbing down their apparent danger and fatality which should appalled many parents.  The film failed for its odd schizophrenic humor: it has many witty retorts too complicated for kids to understand, and physical gags too idiotic for reasonable adults to accept; the film alienates my inner child and my current adulthood. When the toddlers constantly laugh in this movie, I felt nothing but anguish.",1282953600,,752,5.25
1231630,5,B00000J2KA,"Two scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder and Dr. Heep use genius baby studies to fund their Babyco theme park. At age two, the children are due to 'cross over', learn to talk, and forget their universal knowledge. One mischievous toddler, Sly, makes repeated attempts to escape the ""Kinder"" lab and one night, he actually succeeds. What Sly does not expect is to run into his twin, Whit, in a mall playground. Although Sly and Whit share a telepathic bond, they have no idea of each other's existence. When the guards from the lab capture Whit, mistaken him for Sly, and take him back to the Kinder lab, Sly is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, who has mistaken him for Whit. The computer graphics were just amazing: making the babies' mouths talk, having them walk and dance and show appropriate expressions and emotions. This movie had me laughing out loud and had a thoroughly good time watching it.",1263859200,2,897,4.719745222929936

I love this movie I gave it 5 stars becuase the movie is awesome I just wish they would have came out with a movie soundtrack or a video game for this movie if they would have came out with either or I would defently get both the soundtrack and the game if they would come out with either one.",1210291200,18,714,4.25
1231645,1,B00000J2KA,"I'll cut to the chase on this review. This is the worst attempt at comedy that I've ever seen. The whole story involves Dr. Kinder(played by Kathleen Turner) believes that babies hold the key to life's mysteries through their gibberish. So the quack kidnaps kids and holds them in a facility to test her inane theory. One of the babies named Sylvester escapes, they go looking for Sylvester and kidnap the wrong baby and Sylvester comes to the baby's rescue. The jokes fall flat and they have a bad tendency to repeat a lame joke about poop several times. Diaper gravy is not funny and it will never be! All the crummy jokes and gags are not the only flaw of this movie. Kathleen Turner is at her worst here and the rest of the cast is just awful. If you like jokes that wouldnt even appeal to the most simple-minded kid then you're the type of jello-brained idiot...ooops I meant to say this movie was made for you. Here's more movies you'll love if liked this one: Freddy Got Fingered, Look Who's Talking Now, Home Alone 4: Taking Back The House, Honey We Shrunk Ourselves, The Garbage Pail Kids, Howard The Duck, Problem Child 2, 3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain, Scooby Doo(2002), Dude, Where's My Car and Superbabies: Baby Genuises 2.",1208044800,3,1243,4.553571428571429

One thing, little babies is what this movie is geared towards. Not kids, not adults, babies.

Christopher Lloyd is there, and it doesn't help the pain.  Basically, all babies are geniuses, and Kathleen Turner is the antagonist.

1231649,5,B00000J2KA,"Don't be fooled by the apparent innocence of the infant in glasses that graces this video's cover. The cover in no way describes the movie you're about to watch...a dark, violent film noir piece full of sex, deceit, and betrayal.

The film version, like Lord of the Rings, had to be changed a bit for the big screen, and you'll find a few things differ from the original French novel ""Le Genius Babie.""

These changes, as you'll find, are mostly aesthetic. For example: since this film version takes place in the '90s instead of the novel's 19th century setting, the babies use the internet to find their pornography as opposed to looking thru grandpa's lithographs.

But rest assured, the central figure of the film is still Baby John Bastardo. His quest is intact from the novel, too: kill all other living babies (by beheading, of course) to claim his birthright: immortality.

Sound familiar? It should. ""Highlander"" directly ripped off this premise. But I digress.

Unfortunately for Baby John, there's another very smart, very resourceful tot standing in the way of his: Baby George the Beautiful.

I won't give away too much of the plot, as I'm sure you're all familiar with it (after all, Le Genius Babie is required reading in most high schools), but I will relate one of the most chilling scenes I've ever witnessed in cinema: when Baby John takes the beautiful Baby Jean de los Underpants hostage, and subsequently pulls out her right eye with a shrimp fork, I was riveted...RIVETED to my seat.

In short, ""Baby Geniuses"" is definitely not for kids. It's dark, twisted, and a guilty pleasure not to be missed.",1107129600,16,1620,4.805755395683454

Based on the hilarious premise that babies have their own secret language, the script by Bob Clark and Greg Michael wastes no time in getting to the funny, featuring plenty of talking baby footage along the way (how did they do that?).  I actually had to turn my closed caption option on, just to understand the dialogue that I had drowned out with my chuckles.

Since that time, it's been a sort of a personal quest of mine to overrule the movie snobs who trash this movie.

1231655,1,B00000J2KA,"Friends left this for me when I was babysitting their small children. We mutually agreed (they were 5 and 7) to shut it the hell down and go make s'mores.
When ""Body Heat"" debuted in 1981, first time director (yes, it WAS 22 years ago) Lawrence Kasden sealed his career success by debuting a stylish, 40's film noir and coaxing great performances from bad boys William Hurt, Mickey Rourke and Ted Danson (OK,OK, Ted's not a bad boy, but you get my drift). Bursting on the scene like a cat on the prowl was amazing actress and bodyKathleen Turner. Let's face it, the ice cubes in the bathtub scene and the Lauren Bacall voice- channeling made Kathleen one of Hollywood's hottest prospects.
It's sad to thing that, 18 years later and a few good films later, Hollywood has so few roles for older women that Kathleen was reduced to this dreck.
Turner gets dragged through the scenes with some actors of comic note: Christopher Lloyd, Peter MacNichol, Dom Deluise (at least he looks comedic, I don't pass judgement on his normal schtick. ).
The visual effects suck, the tone is histrionic, and director Bob Clark III (How could he give us ""A Christmas Story"" with Peter Billingsley, and actually allow this film to air? Wasn't he afraid? Was he out of his mind?....maybe, he's also the man behind the ""Porky's"" flicks). somehow brings this bomb to a conclusion.

The special effects are just breathtaking. Simply irresistible! If there's one movie your kids have to see in their lifetime, it's ""Baby Geniuses"". You'll watch it and then watch it over and over. You'll ask yourself to go back in time just to experience it for the first time.",1019001600,4,434,4.576923076923077

why was this movie even made? here's all i have to say about the movie.
1-Gene Siskel called it one of the worst movies of the year... and then died later that year(possibly from the movie, we can't be sure...more tests)
2-maximum of 1,000 words, hrmm, i could have done it in two: Diaper Gravy.",1011052800,7,808,4.429530201342282

They aren't even babies there toddlers, I mean come on folks,  my two younger brothers didn't even like this movie.  How can people even compare this to the Rugrats.

When your sitting in a Movie Theatre watching a Kids movie, and the Kids around you are Rolling their eyes and Tuning Out, driving there Matchbox cars on the Arm Rests, that is a Sure-Fire Sign that the Makers of the film have Failed to Hook their Target Audience....",992736000,5,389,4.27027027027027
1231672,1,B00000J2KA,"What in the world was going on with the minds of the makers of this film?  To me, it's obvious that this film was made for very young children.  I felt embarrassed that I saw it in the first place.  You'd think that a live-action movie of toddlers would be one of the best theatrical movies ever.  How can anyone older than 8 enjoy this film?  It's complete GARBAGE!  The only reason I gave it one star is the fact that this is a live-action 'Rugrats', and also because you shouldn't really expect much from a film that's aimed at 5 year olds.  However, they still should have aimed more toward a general audience instead of little kids only.  So unless you need some entertainment for 5 year olds, I'm sure it would be anybody's best interests to leave this crap alone.",975801600,7,770,4.373239436619718
1231673,1,B00000J2KA,"Most of the time, one star reviews are saved for movies that haven't gotten many, to enlighten the public that the views of my peers are inflated. This one, however, has been nearly universally panned, so the  need to write a one star review for it is different. I simply need to  reiterate that no matter how cute you may think it is, no matter how much  you think your kids might like it, you can't condone behavior like making  Baby Geniuses.
The basic premise is that baby talk is actually  intellectual conversation, and that babies lose this ability when they  learn how to speak in their native tongue. For actors, there's a mad  scientist played by Psycho Mom Kathleen Turner, Peter MacNicol as a father,  who was in Ghostbusters II as the Eastern European guy, and Kim Catrall,  currently being easy on Sex in the City, previously making me queasy in the  Police Academy series. They more or less start out with a one star movie,  but it actually goes down from there.
It's basically a mix of Home Alone  shenanagans and babies talking about quantam physics in their diapers.  What? Exactly. This goes past ""nauseating cute"" into  ""throwing fecal matter at the screen and hiding under the couch  cute."" If you can stomach this movie, you're probably a cow and have  six to work with.",964137600,4,1292,4.6255506607929515
1231674,1,B00000J2KA,"What more can I say?  This tasteless, contrived, completely unfunny film with poor special effects to boot actually has Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, Peter MacNichol, and Dom DeLuise in it.  These are actors who at one  time actually had reputations to protect...  Did they all really need a  paycheck THAT badly?  Couldn't they have done dinner theater or a decent TV  movie or something if they were this desperate for cash?  Heck, I know guys  who would love to be married to Kathleen Turner to keep her from having to  do this kind of trash. (Sorry, Kathleen, I'm already taken.  If you'd asked  me ten years ago...) Anyway, avoid this one like the plague.  And if your  kid absolutely insists on seeing it, draw straws with your wife to see  which one of you has to watch it with the little tyke.  If you lose the  first time, ask your spouse if he/she will agree to ""two out of  three.""
P.S. I think that guy Johnny8 was kidding when he gave  this movie five stars (see rest of reviews).  God, I hope so for his sake.",960336000,8,1029,4.43010752688172

I work at a video store and have seen several people on different ocassions  actually BUY this movie!  I wanted to punch them out and put some sort of  sense into them.  If you buy this movie for your kid because he likes it,  you are making a mistake.  It is rubbish like this that makes kids shoot  other kids.  Buy them a good family movie like E.T. or PINNOCHIO.  ANY  thing but this TERRIBLE MOVIE.  Bob Clark makes Ed Wood look like Orson  Welles.  They say the phrase ""Diaper Gravy"" not once, not twice,  but THREE TIMES in this movie, as if the first time wasn't enough.  This  movie should be deleted from mankind's memory.
