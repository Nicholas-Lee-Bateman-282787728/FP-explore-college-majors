4396954,5,B004KKPQMI,"This is probably one of the most engrossing, well-written, well-acted TV series I've seen. Right from the beginning you are absolutely hooked and really have no idea how it will end until the last moments. Every episode is done with such high quality - from the script to the setting to the cinematography. Actress Sofie Grabol (plays Sarah Lund) gives an outstanding performance with her subtle nuances and natural acting. I highly recommend this series!",1309996800,26,455,5.08
4396955,5,B004KKPQMI,"Had to write a short review to provide a counter to the first one.  We started on this series on the basis of the critical reviews of the first couple episodes of the AMC remake.  They stated that as good as the AMC version is, if you can get it, the original is even better.  In two episodes we were hooked and basically marathoned the 20 episodes.  Not sure where the first reviewer got the Twin Peaks analogy, other than a murdered girl, as the tone is polar to that series.  The winning piece of Forbrydelsen is that each character is focused on in parts, and each is a full real character, shades of grey in all.  Well worth your time!",1307836800,80,640,4.24793388429752
4396956,2,B004KKPQMI,"This subtitled Danish series played to high ratings and great critical acclaim earlier this year in the UK, with many comparing it to The Wire, Prime Suspect, and other serious, gritty dramas geared to adults. After reading that the series was slated for an American remake on AMC, I decided to give the original a whirl on the theory that 99% of the time remakes only amount to a pale approximation of whatever the source material was.

I stand by this theory...but, alas, ""originality"" doesn't entirely apply to this series, whose similarities to Twin Peaks are striking. The plot concerns a teenage girl, Nanna Birk Larsen, found murdered in circumstances that remind one strongly of TP's Laura Palmer. Parallel to the murder investigation, a second storyline concerns a reformist politician running a campaign to be the next mayor of Copenhagen and butting heads with the unscrupulous incumbent. Naturally, it doesn't take long for the two storylines to become entangled in ways both expected and unexpected. The series doesn't have David Lynch's trademark touches of the surreal and the whimsical, but is otherwise tonally very similar. Both series pay homage to the film noir era, with many scenes taking place in a half-lit chiaroscuro. Both series rely on the serial / soap opera convention of the episode-ending reveal / cliffhanger. And, as in TP, there's a wide cast of characters, just about every single one of whom is concealing a secret somehow related to the case. Red herrings and misdirection abound: by my count, at one time or another, at least 10 different people in Forbrydelsen are seriously suspected by the police of involvement with the crime.

The strong points of the series are its acting, pacing and cinematography. The actors are uniformly excellent, but especially Bjarne Henriksen and Ann Eleonora Jorgensen as the grieving parents, and Sofie Grabol and Soren Mallingas as the homicide investigators Sarah Lund and Jan Meyer. The series has rightly been praised for its depiction of the effects of a murder on a family, something that is only briefly hinted at in most crime dramas. And while 20 hours seems like a lot to devote to a single investigation, it's actually a refreshing change from the silliness of American crime shows of the CSI or Law & Order ilk, where every crime, no matter how complex or outlandish, gets tied up in a neat little bow in 48 minutes or less. I think many people yearn for the long-form narrative pleasures of yesteryear, when storytellers took their time and didn't have to rush to the instant payoffs of typical network fare. And the series is beautifully, evocatively shot: an autumnal cityscape of rain-swept streets and spooky interiors that effectively convey both menace and loss.

Unfortunately, where the series founders is the most fundamental element of all--plot. If you're going to ask viewers to commit to 20 hours following a single crime, you'd better sure as hell see to it that all the pieces fall into place in the end. With Forbrydelsen the writers don't even come close. It's not that the murderer, when finally revealed, is implausible--most will have pegged the person as a possible culprit early on--but the motive for the killing, the timeline, the multiple crime scenes, and the distribution of clues don't even begin to add up. To take just one example: the killer is supposedly sophisticated enough to leave no trace of DNA anywhere, even taking the trouble to trim the victim's fingernails; nevertheless, the victim is found with her hands bound by plastic ties, but clutching an extremely incriminating piece of evidence. How did this come about? No explanation is offered...probably for the excellent reason that none could be least bit credible. Placement of other key clues (e.g. a video card, a passport) is similarly determined by the need for them to be accidentally found, not because it's the least bit likely they could have been dropped there by the victim at that particular juncture in her ordeal.

Nor is the police work portrayed in a realistic manner: evidence is left jumbled around the office, Lund and Meyer are forever racing off on hunches that can't possibly wait for morning or for back-up, insubordination is tolerated to a degree that would never be found in a real department. And then there's the political plot, which becomes quite tedious less than halfway through the series. It's not so much that the candidate, Troels Hartmann, lurches from crisis to crisis, but that all the crises are so interchangeable and so easily resolved: an alliance that is ""vital"" to Hartmann's ambitions in one episode might be casually discarded an episode later; a revelation that will ""ruin"" his political career is soon overshadowed by other, much more damaging, revelations that seem to have no effect on his polling.

Likewise, many of the secrets the characters keep exist only too obviously for purposes of drawing out the investigation: family members inexplicably withhold information that would be germane to any investigation; other suspects stubbornly refuse to divulge facts that would provide them air-tight alibis if known, etc. If this happened only once or twice in the course of the series it would be vexing, but it happens again and again and again. All sense of verisimilitude is eventually lost. Worst of all, however, is the ending, which involves a ludicrous, melodramatic confrontation between the police and the killer. It is so utterly unbelievable in every way that I actually felt nostalgic for the Log Lady, the backwards-talking dwarf, and the other hocus-pocus elements of Twin Peaks, which at least weren't intended to be taken seriously.

The upshot is a series I devoured eagerly over the course of a couple weeks, but one that left me feeling massively let down at the end of the day. The overwhelming impression is of an opportunity lost. The series has so many affecting performances and wonderfully shot scenes, it's really a shame that the plotting spun so completely out of the writers' control. What could have been a classic of the genre instead ends up being neither fish nor fowl: a self-serious potboiler, a tragedy shot through with farce. 2.5 stars.",1306972800,22,6204,5.018446601941748
4396957,3,B004KKPQMI,"Kept me on the edge of my seat.  But the final episode and any attempt to successfully ring the series to a conclusion was awful.  There was no effort to tie in loose ends or give explanations for several things that happened.  I'm still confused - although I know who the murderer was.  There is much more to a good TV series in this genre than good acting.  It also has to include good plot, reasoned outcome and satisfaction for the viewer. The plot here was OK but so many loose ends and the end episode was deeply frustrating.",1457308800,2,531,4.3232323232323235
4396958,4,B004KKPQMI,"Danish is harder to follow than Swedish.  Except for the fact it's another murder mystery I'd give it 5 stars.

4396959,4,B004KKPQMI,"A follow up to my March 21, 2013 review.

I have watched Borgen, the Bridge, and all of the Killing.  I finally got around lastly to watching the Last of the Trilogy (Season III) and was disappointed in it compared to the I and II parts.
Sarah Lund seemed to have gone deeper into a stubborn and uncooperative character, and she wasn't cute, as the female character in the Bridge might have considered as having ""cute"" idiosynocracies (sp?)
Most of all, I found myself laughing at the flashlight scenes, where they came into dark places looking for something (a killer?)with a flashlight which would let the killer know exactly where they were. This flashlight scene was repeated over-and-over.

Next, re the third part, I have grown weary of child kidnapping stories.  And there is an ending in the third part that seems to defy any stretch of the imagination.  There is a good article in the Guardian trying to justify this ending.

My purchases so far have been: Borgen, Legacy, Bridge and The Killing that I recall at the moment.
I rate these in order of my interest: Legacy, Bridge, Killing, Borgen.
But I rate my favorite as ""The Eagle.""  Loving it!",1442275200,,1155,4.688118811881188

4396965,5,B004KKPQMI,"A terrific detective story, as the other reviewers have said. I wanted to add something I had not seen mentioned -- the price is not as much as one might think, because there are 20 episodes to this season, about twice as many episodes as many US TV show has in a season.

The red herrings come thick and fast with obvious attempts to extend out the storyline however illogical and eventually it seems that the plot construction has spun out of control.  The conclusion is dreadful . Ultimately I felt annoyed at feeling manipulated by a writer whose sole purpose appeared to keep one watching but with no intention of a logical drawing together of events and offering any intellectual satisfaction.  It's described as 'A Thriller' which is fair enough but it's not a detective story as we know it.,1415145600,,582,4.989690721649485

Harley

The Killing, The Bridge, Borgen - the myriad Nordic Noirs and other foreign series and films that are absolutely fantastic and always readily available years before their U.S. counterparts are easily viewable on a multi-regional DVD player.  Our daughter gave us a Pioneer version several years ago and our viewing lives changed forever.

4396975,5,B004KKPQMI,"One of the most exiting series ever made. Very realistic, and also very Danish. The opening chapter is simply superb.",1403049600,,117,4.9
4396976,3,B004KKPQMI,"I purchased the complete Season 1 Region 2 DVDs, which I believe is the original version. The acting is great as well as the production values--thus the reason for the 3-star rating--but frankly, this story could have been told in 10-12 episodes with plenty of time for character development, plot details and nuances.

The writers/producers try to keep you guessing by introducing various subplots and motives, some of which have a soap-opera  kind of vibe to them. Following a tried-and-true formula, suspicion falls on and off several of the characters as the story progresses. Unfortunately, in this series it makes the police seem reactive, as they keep jumping the gun with each new suspect only to get egg on their faces, which forces them to go back to square one over and over again. Eventually, the red herrings become so obvious and predictable that it makes viewing almost frustrating because it's hard to believe that the police can be so nave as they keep going around in circles. To me, this was just a way to unnecessarily extend the series to 20 episodes.

After spending so many hours watching all episodes, the plot resolution is disappointingly weak; personally, I felt that some of the subplots were only partially resolved. The Killing had a promising start and an interesting premise, but it became a struggle after the first eight or ten episodes. For me, this was not worth the time investment--the Wallander Swedish series is by far superior to this one.",1402790400,2,1480,4.912
4396977,5,B004KKPQMI,"This is Danish noir at it's best. The 20, yes, 20 episode season goes through numerous twists and turns that along with the subtitles, you really MUST pay attention to everything that happens.  Pause it if you need to, because there are quite a few red herrings, but this is actually like looking at a book rather than an ordinary TV series. The Danes are an interesting lot for sure. You will not know the solution 'till the end no matter what you think along the way.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1398038400,2,492,4.51685393258427
4396978,5,B004KKPQMI,"So much better than the US version. Even though I had already seen the US version and knew the basic plot twists it was still compelling and difficult to not watch entire season in one sitting. Don't be put off by sub-titles, you actually forget your even reading them. Great acting, it brought me to tears more than once.",1397433600,2,322,4.47457627118644
4396979,5,B004KKPQMI,"Excellent - the AMC series that was based on this was WONDERFUL and so is the Danish version.  They are different and that is what makes both so good - they did not try and exactly copy the original.  I liked the relationship between the two officers in both series even though he is single in one and married with three kids in another !  The dynamic between them is solid and believable.  I cannot recommend both of these series highly enough..  Also, if you have to buy the PAL format, Region 2, which will not play on US DVD players, just play it in your laptop by switching the region code to 2.  (You can only do this a few times, so be careful..)  ""Forbrydelsen"" was not inexpensive but well worth every bit paid.  My son is a submariner and this is going with him the next time he is deployed.  Four months underwater, this should be something he can look forward to on those long days and nights.  We need more shows like this.  We don't get enough choices on American TV.  The British do it much better...",1397433600,3,1015,4.28421052631579

4396981,5,B004KKPQMI,"After watching series 3 of the Killing on TV I like a number of the other reviewers became addicted to the Killing and Sarah Lund. I just had to watch series 1 and 2.

In an interview after the series finished Sofie Grabol said that she didn't mind losing Sarah Lund because she was only a fictional character not real. Well I am sorry Sofie but Sarah became very real to me.

Yesterday I finished watching series 1 of the Killing. I found the series very interesting although a little too much when you considered it end to end. When I say a little too much I mean virtually everyone turned against Lund but she triumphed in the end, there were so many definite killers later to be exonerated, breakups and then make ups for the victim couple and the politician Hartman. Lund became totally focused on solving the case, which she did perhaps at the expense of cutting herself from the rest of humanity. Some reviewers have suggested she almost has some sort of mental illness obsessive something. I don't agree and think the case was so important that the level of attention and focus was justified and her son, mother, boyfriend etc should have understood. Also virtually everybody interviewed contributed to the delay in not finding the perpetrator by not answering questions completely. Virtually everyone questioned deliberately left information out.

It was frustrating to me, as a keen supported of Lund to see how her superiors and all other characters criticized her. But she was right in the end. The superiors only care about their jobs and status, politicians on getting elected at all costs, other people involved in the cases in their own lives and privacy and relatives such as her mother and son their personal self interest. How close is this to the real world ?

I can see why Sofie Gabol looked for Clint Eastwood for inspiration. The underdog against the system but triumphing in the end. The end of series 3 reminded me of the ending in Grand Torino.",1391472000,,1971,4.7043478260869565
4396982,4,B004KKPQMI,"If you wanted to watch The killing again but are afraid it might be a bit repetitive, this could be for you. It basically tells the same story as the first two seasons of the American production, but with a new and fresh cast and Danish setting. Be forewarned it does need subtitles, unless you speak Danish, and you do need a region free DVD player. But that said this and many other series in the ""Nordic Noir"" genre make the player, no more expensive than a standard one, well worthwhile. Sophie Grabol helms this production even more effectively(if that is possible) than her American counterpoint as lead detective Sarah Lund. She is deadpan and intense at the same time. Just as good is Bjarn Henrikson as the father of the murdered girl. His fury is so great and his reactions to his daughter's death so violent,that you have to remind yourself that he is a victim. So many twists and turns and so many surprises, you are kept on the edge of your seat despite having seen the American version.

The plots are complex, the casting is outstanding, the stories are tragic and sometimes horrific, but very contemporary and courageous, confronting what goes on in this world that few other series have confronted so superbly, so directly and without getting on a soapbox. The Danish obviously do not feel the need to give us a splatter-fest where the gun is the only answer, nor is there any gratuitous nudity (very little nudity at all). It takes us to a world, a culture where the troubles of people just trying to do their job and navigate the myriad of roadblocks and resident sociopaths (careerists who will cover up anything to get ahead) along the way. I was very sad to part company with Sarah Lund, her boss Brix, her fellow officers, and the myriad politicians and staffers who make up each series. Intricately crafted, highly intelligent television that only comes along once every bluish moon. I couldn't fault it. Magnificent photography, acting, screenplays, but restrained, sparse, allowing silences and doubt to hover so that we never know 'the truth' until the very end of each series. The best series I have watched in a long, long time. But it is definitely adult viewing. Something, once I have had a break from it, I intend to return to like a treasured book. The team behind this aimed very high rather than other country's standard fare which is just churned out almost mindlessly. No wonder Danes were reportedly transfixed and it became their highest rating drama of all time if my memory serves me correct. An extraordinary, stomach-churning, deeply sad, anger-inducing about what power can and does get away with, and so on.

4397010,3,B004KKPQMI,"I had high hopes for this show (perhaps too high of hopes, in retrospect, given the accolades this show has received), but found it largely disappointing. In short, the show is much much too long and takes itself way too serioiusly without justifying why it should. We are to believe that Copenhagen, the city with perhaps the highest quality of life of any city in the world, and the epicenter of hygge (something akin to ""Danish coziness""), is actually a very scary place where people have little in the way of emotion but much in the way of drive and professional aspiration and cut-throat brutishness. So, think Tivoli-meets-Wall Street but where you never actually see the Tivoli part, or something like that. The effect is a show that is so hard-boiled it is not only not particularly believable but verges on comical at points, all the more so because the plot becomes so drawn out and unnecessarily complicated by mid-season that you are left wondering why someone didn't have the sense to ask them to whittle the series down to ten episodes, which would have sufficed and probably made it a much better show. Better off watching Wallander, or Prime Suspect, or Damages, or even Annika Bengtzon! as mildly cheesy as that series can be, as at least it has some warmth and humanity to it and acknowledges that this is Scandinavia not West Baltimore for Christ's sake!

It's gripping, the acting is very good - in spite of my complete ignorance of Danish - and the central characters are well formed. Lund might be as stubborn as a mule and a bit of a slob (so, not so snobbish on my part!), but you sort of bond with her; even when some situations are a little predictable (ok, there's the curmudgeon bit) it's hard not to almost shout ""Watch out Luuund!"" or ""Take your bloody gun with ya FOR HELVEDE!"".

4397018,4,B004KKPQMI,"Nanna Birk Larsen, a Copenhagen teenager, went missing after a party at her school. Her dad's movie rental card, which she had borrowed, was found in a field near the woods. Clever detective Sara Lund, wearing a sweater with an ugly pattern on it, noticed some kids on bikes heading to a waterway and decided Nanna might be in the water. She was right, Nanna was found dead in the trunk of a car dredged out of the canal. The car belonged to the campaign of Troels Hartmann, who was running for mayor.
The driver of the car had a previous conviction for sexual assault, so obviously he murdered Nanna. The police caught up with him in a flat where he had tied up an old lady. But he wasn't the murderer, it turned out (I forget why not, this was 19 episodes ago).
This was getting interesting, so Lund stayed on the case instead of moving to Sweden to live in rustic bliss with her smooth and boring boyfriend. That meant she had to work with her prickly replacement, Jan Meyer. He was also a little suspicious and hadn't been able to hold down his previous jobs for very long, so could he have been the murderer? No, it turns out he was a really nice (and rather attractive in a crusty way) guy who always got the short end of the stick and was written out of the show very unfairly. Their boss always wanted to talk to Lund by herself without Meyer, which understandably pissed him off.
Forensics showed that Nanna had drowned in the car and that the murderer had raped her and carefully cleaned her hands before he chased her through the woods, so that no traces of him would remain on her. So he might have been an experienced serial killer, but there were no other missing women in Denmark (really?) - or were there? Nanna was holding a black heart necklace when she died.
The car was at the school before it was in the canal, so maybe someone from the school killed Nanna. She had been dating a boy and broke up with him. He must have done it! Lund found a creepy cellar at the school with blood in it. Then she found a home movie showing the ex-boyfriend having aggressive sex with a girl in the cellar after the party. He definitely did it! But it was a different girl, and she had cut herself. He didn't do it!
Well, it could have been a teacher, and Nanna's home room teacher was an Arab called Rama. Suspicious! But wait a minute, he was also one of Troels' Role Models who promote integration. It would be disastrous if one of the Role Models turned out to have murdered a student. Troels stood by him, against everyone's advice.
Clearly Rama was the murderer because he knew the car, having used it before, and he had access to a warehouse which contained a girl's belongings. And Nanna had been to his flat on the night of her death to drop off some books. Her bike was left at his flat. A neighbor saw him carrying something that looked like a body to his car. He talked angrily to someone on the phone in Arabic, warning him not to go to the police. He insisted on continuing to teach, but his students spat on him. It was only when Meyer tracked down the friend that Rama had been talking to, that under duress (after pretending that he couldn't speak Danish) the friend admitted they had been sheltering a Muslim girl who was trying to avoid an arranged marriage. On the same night as the murder.
Unfortunately for Rama, Nanna's dad Theis heard from his employee Vagn that Rama was the main suspect, and Rama had the nerve to show up at Nanna's funeral. Theis, who himself had been in a very suspicious conversation with another Arab guy about his own apartment (we never get to find out why), had been suspected by the police of beating a drug dealer to death years earlier. Generously they did nothing about it. Could this all be a huge conspiracy involving Theis and many Arabs? Theis and Vagn kidnapped Rama and took him to one of their own deserted warehouses, where Theis gave him a beating and only stopped when the police arrived. Theis was arrested but everyone sympathized and he got out.
Troels had been going to quit his campaign when all the evidence against Rama came out, but now he could continue. Great! He was in the clear - or was he? Lund didn't know what to do. Her boyfriend was upset that she wouldn't move to Sweden and missed his housewarming party, so he drove drunk and crashed his car. In the hospital he felt bad about it and gave her some advice on the case. She should look at the car again. She went to look at the car but there was no evidence in it. The killer had meticulously removed all the evidence. But wait, the records for the car showed it needed gas. Maybe the killer got gas? Lund went to ask a clerk at City Hall about it. The clerk had no idea if the car was filled up. She would have to check the security cameras of all the gas stations in the city.
Lund and Meyer watched lots of gas station security camera footage. They realized old footage had been taped over. There would be no record of October 31, the night of the murder. But then the precise footage they needed appeared on the last tape! It wasn't taped over after all! How lucky is that? Someone got gas. Lund recognized him even though his face wasn't visible on the tape. It was the clerk from City Hall! The one who said he had no idea if the car was filled up.
The clerk sheepishly admitted he did go and pick up the car from the school, filled it with gas and returned it to City Hall. So the murderer probably had no connection with the school! He might have had a connection with City Hall, though. Lund's boss didn't like this idea. Someone was pressuring him to keep Lund away from City Hall. Someone deleted a number from Nanna's cell phone. It was Troels' number! Lund's boss was made the scapegoat and forced to retire. He was replaced by the very sinister Brix. Brix wished Lund would move to Sweden like she kept saying she would.
Lund checked the security footage from City Hall. Troels drove the car out of the parking garage that night! He had to be the murderer. She had been told to stay away from City Hall, but she didn't. She and Troels really kind of fancied each other in a love-hate kind of way, but that was inappropriate. She discovered that he owned lots of pairs of identical shoes. He spilled wine on his shirt. Or did he do it deliberately?
Lund found out that Troels had been using a party flat. She went there and it was covered in Nanna's blood! Case closed. Troels drove to the flat, met Nanna there (his lover), and killed her. Troels had been calling himself Faust on a dating website and had exchanged emails with Nanna. More damning evidence. How foolish of him not to delete the emails or clean up the flat after he murdered her. Brix had to let Lund arrest Troels.
A civil servant was acting strangely and the police wanted to talk to him, but he was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Lund found the vehicle that killed him at a property belonging to Jens Holck, a party leader with whom Troels had wanted to get into an alliance. (It's too complicated to explain how she did this and anyway I can't remember.) Lund didn't believe Troels was the murderer. He was too sexy. Brix thought she was just going crazy. Troels was outraged at being arrested, but shouldn't really have been considering that it was his car, flat and dating profile that were associated with the murder. Troels insisted he had never met Nanna - or had he?
Holck confronted Lund and knocked her gun out of her hand. Lund was Holck's prisoner. He wished he could let her go, but that wouldn't work. He would have to kill her. He was going to kill her and stuff her in the trunk of his car, but she told him she had called Meyer. Holck showed her that he had smashed up her cell phone, so she couldn't have called him. Lund said she had another cell phone in her car. Holck should go check. He went to look and she frantically tried to free herself. There was no cell phone in the car. Holck came back to kill Lund, but Meyer arrived just in time and killed Holck.
Troels could go free, Holck was the murderer. A missing security tape from City Hall was mysteriously delivered to Lund and it showed him with Nanna. They had been having an affair. But Holck had told Lund that he didn't kill Nanna at the flat. Why would he think Nanna was killed at the flat if he was the murderer? Something wasn't right. Lund wanted to keep investigating, but Brix took away her badge, because she had gone off the deep end.
Holck had found Troels' computer logged into a dating website and took over the Faust alias to meet Nanna online while Troels had stopped dating and hooked up with his adviser, Rie. Troels hadn't wanted to tell the police his alibi because he had been drinking at the flat on the anniversary of his wife's death from cancer and then went to his cottage and tried to gas himself, but the door blew open and he lived. He didn't even tell Rie, so she broke up with him for being dishonest.
Troels was back in the game. Lund went without her badge to ask about the disappearance of a girl 15 years previously. She went to her dad's house and saw a picture of her wearing a black necklace. She was on the trail of a serial killer! The girl had moved house just before she disappeared. The killer could be a mover! Wait, Nanna Birk Larsen's dad owned a moving company! And a taxi driver called Leon told the police that he had driven Nanna to the flat and they had stopped at City Hall, where she met Holck to get the key. He had seen someone in a red mover's overall near the flat. The Birk Larsen overall was red!
Nanna's childhood sweetheart, Amir, the son of the Arab guy Theis had been talking to, showed up and admitted he had been waiting at the airport to elope with Nanna on the night of her murder. Thanks for mentioning this before, Amir! Amir was too young to have killed a girl 15 years ago. He was not the murderer. Lund found his love letters to Nanna inside the globe lamp in her room. The police who had spent days examining her things never noticed this cunning hiding place.
Leon showed up at the Birk Larsen offices and put on a red overall. He was a mover for them too! But he never mentioned that to the police. The police interviewed Vagn. He said that he wouldn't have killed Nanna because he loved the whole family, and was godfather to her brothers. He had worked for the moving company that moved the other murdered girl 15 years before. But he didn't mention that Leon had too.
Leon had newspaper cuttings about the case on the wall of his flat. He was the murderer! The girl's body was found in the canal where Lund wanted to look, in a moving company's bag. Lund got her badge back, she had linked the two cases. Meyer wanted to spend an evening with his family, but Lund wanted him to come with her to look for some evidence in a deserted building. Lund went inside and told Meyer to wait in the car. Meyer said he could see her flashlight upstairs. Lund said she didn't have a flashlight. The murderer was in the building! Leon must be there! Meyer grabbed Lund's gun and went in. But the murderer knocked him down, took the gun and shot him twice. An ambulance took him to the hospital in critical condition.
The doctors said Meyer would live, but Brix visited him and then he died. Interesting. Lund was blamed for killing Meyer. She had imagined the murderer in the building. She was crazy. Her boyfriend got her out of custody with a fake psychologist's report saying she was depressed. She went to track down Leon and found him hanged in a ship, leaving a note saying ""Sorry"". Leon was the murderer. End of story. But he didn't kill Meyer. He got gas in another part of the city when Meyer was shot. So Lund knew he wasn't the murderer. Meyer's last words were ""Sara"" and ""84"". Obviously he was accusing Sara Lund. Or not. He never called her Sara, he called her Lund.
Nanna's brother Anton found her bloody passport in the basement of the new house that Vagn had been working in. But then it disappeared and was found planted in Leon's yard. Lund went to check out the new house and saw Vagn there. Vagn was wearing a sweatshirt that said ""Sarajevo `84"" on it. Vagn knew his number was up.
Anton had his birthday party and Vagn was there. Vagn said he was going to take Theis to get a surprise for Anton. Theis thought they were going to pick up a dog, but his wife Pernille found that Vagn had already left a dog at the house. Theis forgot his cell phone (people always have to do that in thrillers to keep up the suspense). Pernille and Lund set out in pursuit of Theis and Vagn. The rest of the police finally got behind Lund's hunches and went after Vagn too, after finding traces of blood in the new house he was helping to renovate for Theis. Vagn stopped the van in the woods and whacked Theis in the head. He was going to kill Theis, but why? He put on a heavy coat - to protect his clothes from blood splatters? - and marched Theis deep into the woods. He gave Theis his gun and told him that he killed his daughter because he was jealous of her relationship with the ""raghead"". It was all very spontaneous and nothing like the murder that was described at the beginning. And where did Nanna get the black heart necklace? Did he put it into her hand? The police and Pernille and Lund all showed up and begged Theis not to kill Vagn, but Vagn kept provoking him by describing the murder. Theis killed him. He was arrested and looked headed to jail for life.
The mayor of Copenhagen, Bremer, had a stroke and was out of the election. Troels, who had got back together with Rie, broke up with her for good and fired her, accusing her of canceling the delivery of a toilet to the flat and cleaning up some of the blood to try and protect him when she thought he was the murderer. That was so unethical. On his deathbed the mayor told Troels to do the right thing. Then he realized his campaign manager, Morten, was the one who covered up for him. Morten had found an old photograph of Nanna hugging Troels at a fun run. Bremer found it too and gave it to Troels. Morten was in the background. Morten persuaded Troels it was all for the best. Troels kept Morten and took over as mayor. Brix told Lund she could stay in the police if she shut the hell up about all the cover-ups. She walked away from him. The end - or is it?",1339718400,,14306,4.320565265898104

Prickly often silent in the face of questions, she knows where she is going but perhaps not who she is.

The luxury of 20 episodes to tell the story of one murder cannot be minimized as a strength of the series but you still need writers and actors who can keep up a relentless pace with some story credibility - and they don't disappoint.

But having said that I am glad I did or I would have not been able to keep up with all the plot twists. Anyway I enjoyed the show.

Also, most scenes are shot at night, intended, I assume, to lend a more sinister feel to the process, but instead just leads one to conclude that there is either no sun in Denmark or nobody works during the day.  And predictably, the lead is a renegade detective, driven and operating on her own terms (no originality there) that finds clues and draws conclusions that apparently others are too stupid to arrive at.  Yes, it's fun and a good watch, but superior television - hardly.",1332547200,5,642,4.705357142857143
4397029,1,B004KKPQMI,"This series evidently inspires great praise and enthusiasm from most reviewers.  However, it failed for me.  I was too irritated by the contradictory characterizations, the turgid pace, and the miserable ambiance to continue to watch after a few episodes.  Without wishing to reveal plot details, too many of the characters are introduced to us as one type of personality only to start behaving in a quite contrary manner.  Just not credible.  20 hours of tortuous false trails only leads back to the perpetrator who is evident from the first episode.

The sense of personal and societal breakdown that radiates from so many Scandinavian detective writing is oppressive (see Mankell, Sjwall and Wahl, Larsson, etc.).  `Noir' hardly captures the darkness of these works.  I'll take Italian, American, British and French crime writing before this every time.",1327536000,8,856,5.288888888888889
4397030,5,B004KKPQMI,"To put it as simply as possible, the Danes have put American, English and Australian TV to shame with this must-see murder mystery thriller. The acting is so well done, so nuanced, it seems almost ducumentarian in it's approach, without of course the usual boredom that can come along with watching the average documentary, the story unfurls like some great novel of our time, and midway through you start to believe that almost every character being investigated could be the culprit and to be honest, I have never been so on the edge of my seat for close on twenty hours. I would challenge anyone not to be completely devastated by the end of the very first episode, I was in tears myself, and had to, get this, HAD TO, rewind to watch the last ten minutes of that episode straight away. It has been compared to The Wire and I think this, although meant as a complitment, is a bit misguided. In Australia we have a show that is touted as our best effort called the Underbelly series, and if compared to other Aussie shows like Home and Away or Rescue it does tower somewhat above the rest, but if you compare this show to The Wire, is comes off as a bit of a midget in a room full of giants. The makers of Underbelly think that making 50% of the show in slow-mo with some grudgy hip hop sound track comes off as being artistic, instead of looking like the majority of music videos around today, somewhat sleasy and dull to the senses after a short while. And one could say the same of The Wire, when compared to the dross of NCIS / CIS / CLOSER'S type of shows being churned out of the Hollywood factory of Campbell Soups cooks passing themselves off as directors and producers, it does tower somewhat, however, once again when comepared to what the Danes have been able to pull off here with The Killing, The Wire too comes off as a rather lazy, indulgent little shadow in a room full of blinding light. The Danes don't seem to need to resort to the usual onslaught of HBO sleaze and filth passed off as necessary 'language' and completely needless and pointless grapthic sex scenes that the makers of Oz and The Wire so seem to enjoy corrupting our homes with - that's just simply shock over substance and laziness and sleaziness for the sake of it to the upmost. So when I saw that The Killing was being compared to The Wire, I was a bit concerned. But, as it turned out, I had absolutely no need to be. These writers can sell their wares without having to resort to needless sleaze and filth. And don't get me started on the depth and style of the camerawork! Dazzling! The lead actress was simply amazing in this role, utilising a very understated approach, and a nice surprise to see an atractive female in a lead role that one would see walking down the average street in the average town, a beauty highlighted just as much by flaw as by perfection, as opposed to the nipped/tucked/sucked and hoisted Hollywood bimbo-models we usually have to put up with on television from the US of A, she reminded me of a young Jenny Agutter from Teh Railway Children and An American Werewolf in London fame. Her parnter, Jen, was played just as brillantly, once again with an understated passion just glowering below the observable surface - and what a wonderful change to see a married family man as a lead character - Boy! But you don't get much of that from tinsel-town these days either - they seem so stuck on their anti-hero model that unless the hero is a relativistic mishmash of disgusting behaviours filled with addictions of one kind or another that the idea of a good man who loves his wife and adores his children seems to them a concept so dull that it does not bear worth thinking about. Hollywoods idea of an interesting cop is a zen ex con who will allow some murderers off while he sleeps around crunching assorted fruit products! I know! Sad, isn't it. Anyhoo, back to The Killing: The family affected by the tragedy in this story, are, one could fairly state, the very heart of this incredible show, and the writing was such that one is enticed along in to experience their devastation; and what devastation it truly is. I cannot recommend this show, which is really a piece of art, highly enough. It is one of the very best things that television has ever broadcast in any country. This should be required viewing everywhere and if you have not seen this thriller from Copenhagen you are doing yourself a great injustice. The only downside is every other thriller after this is going to seem somewhat artificial. I am currently watching the American version and so far - cudos to them - they are pretty much sticking to what the Danes have done, just speeding up the process somewhat into 13 episodes instead of the 20 from the original. So to conclude, great, great story, fantastic writing that doesn't treat the viewer as an idiot who needs to be silver-spoon fed all the clues along the way, great production values, wonderful camera work, eerie, dark atmostphere throughout, the acting from everyone, from the charismatic politian to the smallest, seemingly insignificant role, was masterful, the actors protraying the family affected did so good a job that one's heart was left like a tattered sail hung on half mast after many, many scenes. But it is the two main police detectives that stand tall above a very towering cast. It has not been done this good ever and I think it will be a long time before anyone, anywhere, will be able to top what has been accomplished here. Do youself a favour and buy this now. Don't let the price or subtitles put you off - I hate watching things with subtitles, but this was so well written and acted that I soon adjusted to the point that I didn't even notice after a very short while. Like I said, I cannot recommend this thriller from Denmark highly enough and I think people everywhere involved in TV could learn a great deal about how to hook an audience and reel them in in a manner that transends the normal viewing trends around today. To all the people who made this show - Thank you so much, you gave me a great 18+ hours of nail-biting, heart rending, edge of my seat entertainment, and oh, the tears I shed throughout! Can't wait to see Season Two. Loved it! Loved it completelty from beginning to end. And I can't say fairer than that.",1324166400,5,6309,4.506108202443281
4397031,5,B004KKPQMI,"Not to knock the AMC channel version which is actually very good . The acting is superb and it still kept a very dark Nordic Noir ""feel"" to the production.
I know a lot of people in the US will not watch a show that has English subtitles so if that is the case the English Language AMC version is the way to go for you.
The original is an absolute masterpiece, others have said it all so I won't go on about it.

Either way do not miss this great show !!!.

Addendum:
Well I finally finished the 20 episode (PAL Import version) and I must admit it IS light years ahead of the AMC USA series (Which is no slouch either), even if you don't like sub-titled movies you MUST see this version, it is the best crime series since the early Prime Suspect,Homicide,Frost & Twin Peaks IMHO in fact it's even better, the complexity of the plot, the ever shifting plethora of suspects the impact of the crime not just on the family but the all of characters is just captivating and so rarely seen in our contemporary TV where everything gets wrapped-up in 60 minutes, life & death, good & bad are not that simple. Kudos to Danish TV for reminding us that TV does not have to be dumbed-down for morons who who have never read a good book unless it was required reading for an college exam.",1320451200,27,1275,4.242798353909465
4397032,5,B004KKPQMI,"I have watched so many drama/thriller series. I found The Killing mesmerising. The gloomy setting, the complex characters, many twists and turns. I am not keen on sub titles, but was not cognisant of the sub titles because of the magnificent characters and ever changing plots. Loved it!!!!",1319673600,9,290,5.0625
4397033,5,B004KKPQMI,"I first saw 'The Killing' last year on US television on the AMC channel. This was the US version, and I quickly became entranced with this remarkable crime thriller, taking place in Seattle. The ending of year one was very disappointing, the characterization and plot line was remarkable.

And, then I had a chance to view the original Danish version, ' Forbrydelsen' series. Is it possible for one person to view 20 episodes in a week? This series is so fantastic that I was compelled to view all 5 discs, 4 episodes per disc. I also feel compelled to say that if you have a chance to view this series, grab it, run as fast as possible to your DVR, and prepare for a siege, load up on liquids and food.

'Forbrydelsen'  takes place in Copenhagen. The city we see seldom has sun, we see the rain, dreary, crime ridden side of Copenhagen.  Sarah Lund, played by Sofie Grabol, plays the lead Detective Inspector. As we meet her she is getting ready to leave her job to start a new life with her fiancee and son in Stockholm. And, then, on her last day, after the party and the good-byes, a horrific crime is committed. However, all we know at first is that a young woman's bloody underclothes are found in a wooded area. Lund is called and with her acute detectives intuition moves on to solve the crime. Her partner, excuse the expression, in crime, is the new Detective Inspector, Jan Meyer. He expects to be in charge but as the case proceeds, he accepts Sarah is staying. We don't know much about Sarah and Jan. But as time moves along, their characters are fleshed out, and we come to accept and understand them better, so it is easier to predict how they will react. We meet the murder victim in flashbacks, the parents, the family, the working colleagues of the parents. Inserted into this storyline is an entire political campaign. The entire series kept me on the edge of my seat.

Each episode depicts a day in the life of the crime. We follow the Detectives as they proceed to develop their case. We meet the politics of the police department, their colleagues and games that are played there. The family is the most entrancing part of this series. We are with the mother and father as they find out their daughter is missing, and we are with them when they see their daughter at the morgue. We are with them in their disbelief, confusion and anger. We are with them as they attempt to work through their grief. This is remarkable acting. There was not one of the episodes that I thought was too slow. Each episode held me in suspense. There were no shortcuts, nothing fussy or fancy, superb acting. I remembered an old television show, depicting historical events and titled ""You Are There'. Well, this is exactly how I felt. I was there, with the detectives, the family, the murderer, the politicians and their people. Superb seems like such a meager word to describe this series. My favorite series until 'Forbrydelsen' was 'The Wire'. I have moved on, 'Forbrydelsen' rates number one for me. The series has subtitles and in my experience subtitles add to the film. I did not miss one word of this fabulous series.

The  wonderful experience of this series was that each character had some relationship to someone else, so that the entire cast was brought into the fold. How this clever script was able to manage this was from the extraordinary writing. I understand there is a Season Two of ""Forbrydelsen' and a soon to be Season Three.  Who do I remember most from this series? Sarah Lund, Sofie Grabol, who plays Lund is an exceptional actress and her expressions relay more than than her voice at times. I am anxious to see how she plays in the next set of series. Superlatives reign!

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 10-13-11

4397034,1,B004KKPQMI,"Brilliantly directed and written (but with some grossly implausible bits in the storyline).

Superbly acted. Wonderfully believable and sympathetic characters. And with an ending so totally miserable, and with such ghastly additional descriptions of the girl's death, that I was left wishing I had never begun watching it.

I am totally baffled by trying to understand why people, who like me went through all twenty hours of this, could feel they were glad they'd watched it, and would give it five stars, thereby recommending others to watch it. Is there a sort of sadism involved in wanting to share such misery?

I certainly wish I did not now have in my head `memories' of such abject horror.",1315094400,8,697,4.94017094017094
4397035,5,B004KKPQMI,"Four years after it's Danish debut, The Killing made it's way onto British screens. Having had a winter double-bill run on Saturdays at 9pm on BBC4, the series has had fantastic ratings of over 500,000 viewers, which is pretty decent for subtitled drama.

The Killing, known in Denmark as Forbrydelsen, is a 20 part mystery which attempts to find out Who killed Nanna Birk Larsen. Detectives Sarah Lund (Sofie Grbl) and Jan Meyer (Sren Malling) are assigned to the case on the day before Sarah is due to start her new life with her son Mark and partner Bengt in Sweden. Chainsmoking Meyer has to wait until Lund has left in order to fully take over the reins.

Two of the most powerful performances in the series are given by the actors playing Nanna's parents Theis and Pernille Birk Larsen. Ann Eleonora Jrgensen and Bjarne Henriksen's characters show the extent of coping with the death of a teenage daughter and the frustrations of the murder hunt. I particularly admire Anna's performances which she handles perfectly as well as her excellent scenes with the two Birk Larsen boys.

A third storyline running through the series is the Copenhagen Mayoral Election involving Troels Hartmann (Lars Mikkelsen) and his co-workers and rivals at City Hall. The politicians lives are disrupted due to the murder and we fully explore political backstabbing at a local coalition level.

Having been successfully screened around Europe and Australia, The Killing has also had a US remake, which screened the first 13 episodes in the spring of 2011.

If you like a decent crime drama and appreciate fine quality acting, then The Killing is for you.

You may be a little reluctant to invest nearly 20 hours in a subtitled drama, but you'll be glad you did!

You may like to take a look at other offerings featuring Ann Eleonora Jrgensen (In Your Hands, Italian For Beginners, Just Like Home) and Lars Mikkelsen (Flame and Citron, Headhunter).

Admirers of Lars Mikkelsen may ike to know that his brother Mads appeared in another fine Danish police series Unit One (Rejseholdet), a 32 part series which has been released in Australia on Region 4 DVD.

Enjoy the series. You'll be glad you made this purchase, believe me!",1313366400,5,2210,4.8563829787234045

8433000,5,B004KKPQMI,"Forbrydelsen or The Killing is a 2007 twenty-episode Danish murder mystery and thriller, created and written by Soren Sveistrup, and produced by Danish DR Television. The story line of its first season centers around the investigation of the gruesome and mysterious murder of a young Danish woman, along with the contentious and interrelated Copenhagen mayoral race. The lead detective is an introverted and conflicted female police officer, who is a brilliant and relentless investigator, but who is unable to communicate effectively, and to separate her chaotic work life from her dysfunctional personal life. There are many clever plot twists, which serve to challenge the viewer throughout the course of the series. Forbrydelsen is an exceptionally intelligent and intriguing detective procedural series, because it provides numerous credible murder suspects, each of whom is highly suspicious, and could easily be the killer. In addition, the atmosphere of Forbrydelsen is exceedingly dark and foreboding, in the classic Nordic Noir cinematic style. The performance of the lead actor, Sofie Grabol, is absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. Forbrydelsen is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Forbrydelsen features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505692800,2,1543,5.771929824561403
