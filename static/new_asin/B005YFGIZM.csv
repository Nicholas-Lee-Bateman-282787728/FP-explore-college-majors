4905943,5,B005YFGIZM,"Definitely worth a watch - and not just by yourself. Watch it with others and talk about local food and sustainable agriculture. And begin to change your local, FRESH food story! Reimagine what's possible with what and how you eat.",1329177600,2,231,4.8
4905944,5,B005YFGIZM,"I watched this movie not long after watching ""Food Inc"" for the first time.  It was a great movie to follow that one with.  You got a look at things that we all can do -- starting a garden, community gardens, how to do things organically, etc.  It would have been better on a smaller scale as well, but is a very thought-provoking movie and well worth watching.",1329177600,5,361,4.279411764705882

4905948,5,B005YFGIZM,"I'm obsessed with food documentaries, and this one is one of the best.  Think about it as a partner to Food Inc (as many in the other comments have said). I don't really have anything else to say that others haven't already said, but everyone needs to see this and realize how corporations are ruining our food and hurting animals and the Earth.",1478304000,,345,4.476190476190476

4905961,5,B005YFGIZM,"Just about every concept discussed in this movie is valid.  The most interesting point for me was the discussion about ""feeding the masses"" which I have held different beliefs in the past.  While it might be a mindset shift, what they are saying here is that you can move away from mass industry growth of animals and still feed the masses.  Certainly points to ponder.",1458864000,,369,4.6461538461538465

4906070,4,B005YFGIZM,"Enlightening and terrifying!  Industrialized farming is NOT good for your health - it maybe more profitable for farmers and the US economy, but consumers are paying a price and (hint) it is not just $$.  We are seeing so many children and adults with allergies, asthma and other respiratory illnesses.  The GMO's, antibiotics and other farming practices such as feeding dead animals to chickens, pigs and other farm animals is wrong and is not natures way in upholding the circle of life. If we don't change directions soon; we will see more serious illnesses down the road.  Oh but wait -- the pharmaceutical companies will develop a new product to treat these side-effects and sell it to us for big bucks.  Something is wrong with this!",1430956800,,738,4.825396825396825

4906073,5,B005YFGIZM,I saw this item on TV and I was a bit apprehensive about how well this item would work keeping your food and vegetables fresh for a longer period of time and I must say it's excellent!!! It's definitely worth the 49.99!!! It also keeps your  refrigerator smelling fresh and clean longer as well. I highly  recommend it.,1430352000,,319,4.482758620689655
4906074,5,B005YFGIZM,"This is an honest look and what can and should be done in the agriculture business.

4906119,4,B005YFGIZM,Very similar to the many similar documentaries out there but it effectively gets the message across.  The only problem is I'm sure the people (like me) that watch these doccies are the ones that care about what they eat anyway.  All the people I know - including family members - that eat junk food and don't care about the environment would never watch something like this.

4906157,5,B005YFGIZM,"Very informative documentary about the nature of industrial vs natural farming and how natural farming is much more sustainable in terms of feeding the growing population.  The profiles on the natural famers were very sweet and educational.  There are scenes of industrial farming that may be upsetting to sensitive viewers.  All in all, a great film - well done!",1419897600,,363,5.11864406779661
4906158,5,B005YFGIZM,"I've watched 'Fresh' more than once. There is a lot of valuable information in this 'just over an hour' documentary. It moves quickly enough to keep one interested, certainly not boring. It delivered information that is accurate. Unfortunately, the things that Fresh addresses have not changed how big industry grows food or raises animals. Only produces stronger chemicals to put in/on our foods so they can produce these things faster and make more money.

This documentary on food made me think about the 'cost' of mass produced food products in our country. I have deliberately made food choices based on information I obtained from viewing ""Fresh""",1419897600,,652,5.150943396226415

4906161,4,B005YFGIZM,"Strongly a one sided view on our agricultural system.  The film makes you think about where your food source is coming from and how it has changed the last 20 years or so.  I thought there were some great points to be made and for me, it followed most of my thoughts on how industry has changed and not for the better.  I do think they went a little to far making their point and I am not sure about a few of their statistics.  However, it is defiantly a well made documentary and I whole heartedly agree with the main point of the film.",1418947200,,537,4.085714285714285

Being only 2 years old when we moved to a farm & began gardening, canning & picking local fruits & berries, I'm really determined to eat & Grow healthy food. I buy at the Farmer's Markets & can, pickle, freeze and preserve whatever we don't eat fresh so I enjoyed hearing about the state of food currently. The farmers' perspective was really interesting & the movie didn't ""shame you"" into feeling that you should go vegan or something. Great information without preaching!

4906240,4,B005YFGIZM,"Another Eye opening documentary about our food supply.  It was surprising, disheartening yet somewhat hopeful to hear a conventional farmer who uses pesticides say that within the agricultural community, organic farmers are held up on pedestals by many. I just wish those farmers would take the plunge and do the right thing for society and their own families.
The other interesting tidbit they focused on was the mono crop system we have implemented in the US that goes against all farming basics.  We have tried it, it is causing and will cause more detrimental effects than its benefits...it is time to go back to basics....what truly works.  food as it should be

I used to think organic, gmo etc was a bunch of hippie nonsense until I did my own research. Now I feel like an idiot. :)

It's ironic, you think food is keeping you alive when in reality it can kill you. I'm not talking about eating 3 pizzas and drinking a gallon of soda.

4906261,5,B005YFGIZM,"this really opens your eyes to the food system today and makes you rethink what goes into your mouth.  the whole food system is corrupt and tainted with poisons and our bodies pay the price along with the true farmers in the country being put out of good work.  if this movie along with FOOD,INC. does not change our eating habits and desire to consume fresh local produce that is nutritious and healthful for not only you but the environment as well then nothing will.

There is a great disconnect between our grocery store purchases and knowing where this food is coming from and being pumped full of chemicals, hormones, pesticides, etc is alarming to me!  I DEMAND healthful foods to go into my body.  Since eating local produce and grass-fed beef, pork, and free range chicken and eggs I have lost 80 pounds, been taken off blood pressure medications and put my Hashimoto's thyroiditis and IBS symptoms into remission.  I feel amazing.  I am convinced that I was being poisoned by our food system and I along with the FDA was allowing it.. NO MORE!  Eat local.  Support farmers.  Support your communities.  You will feel amazing and your communities will thrive and bond.

4906262,4,B005YFGIZM,"Great introduction to the concept of local and organic food - 4 out of 5 stars. This is a jumping-off point - if you like what this movie says, you will have to do some (rewarding) work to apply it to your life as either a consumer or as a producer. In the free-market system, every dollar spent on local food is a vote for healthy people and a healthy planet.

Why only 4? I would have like to have actually seen a few graphics of the data from the studies that confirm organic farming methods can feed the world and are more cost-efficient long-term than current industrial farming. It is all well and good to dispel common misconceptions about the sustainable farming movement, but I think it would be even more convincing if the personal stories presented were paired with the hard data.

What is upsetting - and this goes for the industry as a whole - are the pleas for subsidy. It muddles the argument that natural, small growing is doable.

[SPOILER]

Worse, still, at the very end of the credits, is the last guy who says that it's a ""social justice"" and ""food justice"" issue, that good, healthy food is a ""human right.""

All that good will built up over the film just lit on fire and thrown out the window.

Factory farming or industrial farming is completely to the detriment of our health & our earth.  Like Michael Pollan said on this film, a $.79 dozen (factory-farmed) eggs may look the same as a $4-5 dozen of eggs, but nutritionally, there's no comparison.  He also said we pay somewhere when it comes to food.  If we don't pay for the food, we'll pay doctors later...we'll pay with our health.  I can't believe that it's come to this in our country.

If you are someone who watches films on these sort of topics often then this will be nothing new and maybe just a little bit different of an approach as far as how to 'fix' the problem. If however, you are just giving this sort of genre a try, then I would recommend it if you're just dipping your toes in the water.
This movie shares just enough information to keep people's attention, offer a true perspective on our poor agricultural and live stock practices and shows a good deal of b-role and interviews to not gross out or intimedate the audience from not watching the full movie but to get an idea.
Bottom line, give this some thought: YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT! Ignorance to the harmful chemicals and genetically altered food that we grow then feed to live stock and to ourselves is a poor excuse to being a part of this cycle.

It doesn't matter whether you eat meat or not. This documentary is, at it's core, a film about happier, healthier people that are supporting one another and the land itself.

Unlike many documentaries on this topic, this one has no narration (apart from a few words on screen here and there), so you're just hearing the farmers' varying perspectives.

The film makes compellingly clear that our government and corporations are consciously choosing to de-prioritize our health in order to maximize those corporations' profits. That corporations are doing this no longer surprises most of us; but that the government (or perhaps the 'political machinery' might be more apt here) would collude is puzzling since a clear consequence of a nation of unhealthy people (profoundly unhealthy) is astronomical health care and a host of other 'hidden' costs.

The Documentary also introduces us to a variety of inspiring and eccentric innovators in the food production landscape who are working to heal us with healthy food and healthy modes of production.

One part shows one land parcel as earning $150 per acre and the one right next door as $3000 per acre. Speaking fees and educational classes should not be included in a farm's revenue view.

So... What can a person do? Be more aware. Choose the route decided upon by our own moral compass. If you can have a small garden, do so! If you can have a few chickens, do so! If you can buy local from a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) then do so! If you can't do any of these things, at least be willing to learn.

4906379,5,B005YFGIZM,Food Inc described the problem.  Fresh describes the solution.  We are redesigning the food system to produce healthy affordable food sustainably.

4906380,3,B005YFGIZM,"The first part of the film makes a great point about crop and livestock rotation. It's all about working with nature not trying to manipulate,circumvent or fool it. Even though I'm certain that large quantities of antibiotics and genetic bottlenecking are harmful for human consumption I still want to see numbers on yield differences between non organic and organic crops. The yield,cost and acreage needs of grass fed versus grain fed livestock pound for pound. If grain is unnecessarily and wrongfully being fed to cattle and can produce equal, greater or something even close to equal yields of beaf to the market let's take two seconds of film to show this mathematic and scientific data so that others and I can embrace these positions. Otherwise this film is shooting blanks not empowering people with a sound philosophy. Not meaning that what is being said isn't true just that we would be relying on faith instead of fact. Something that SOUNDS good isn't necessarily something that IS good for the bigger picture. Some of the comments about government subsidisation are dead on. Getting government out of the subsidizing business in our food industry is essential for the natural food market to heal. For anyone how thinks that substantial governmental involvement is necessary to fix the food industry they fail to realize that substantial governmental involvement is what enabled and incentivized these corporate monstrosities to exist. Other good messages are made like supporting regional farmers and educating people from more urbanized environments with small scale greenhouses to give a general understanding of the overall growing needs and processes. I didn't agree with all that was said and done but the film had some good points to make. Watching this film wouldn't be a waste of time but they could of given some boring facts from some external resources to go along with the commentary.",1366156800,8,1910,5.125

I have watched some of the documentaries that have a more graphic portrayal of animal cruelty, which I think is necessary for a person to be fully aware of how their food is produced, but Fresh shows what it can be like:  happy little pigs, healthy cows and chickens, and the ease of growing abundant produce.

As a child we had our own chickens, sheep, hogs, and cows, not to mention a large vegetable garden every year. As a young married I lived on a four generation turkey farm. We also had cows, hogs, and the large vegetable garden. In my 30's I worked for a farrow to finish hog operation. You can see the trend. ""Fresh"" just substantiated everything I already knew and informed me of many things I didn't. I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this documentary to do so. I would further urge that we all educate ourselves to the poison we are putting into our bodies and that whenever possible we buy locally. Sustainable agriculture I believe and pray is the way of the future, which is our past full circle. It doesn't take a farmer or a farm background to understand the common sense logic of this film.

We simply cannot produce enough food to feed the population with these methods-to convert to these methods it would take more land than we have in the US.  There has to also be a change in our consumption, a lot less of everything-and if some can handle it-eliminate animal flesh and their secretions all together-the land and resources nor our health can handle consuming all that we do-organic-free range-industrial-it all takes finite resources that we just can't keep wasting when there are alternatives.",1359936000,8,789,5.108527131782946

4906432,4,B005YFGIZM,"This documentary provides a good introduction into the problems of the industrial agricultural system. With the emphasis on productivity and efficiency by large corporate agricultural players, the quality of food has been sacrificed. Since food has been specialized, standardized, and diversification of crops has dwindled, the food system is providing mostly cheap, highly processed foods instead of fresh, healthy vegetables and fruits. There are concerns about the quantities of antibiotics injected in meats, widespread use of chemicals and pesticides, and 3-4 large corporate agricultural players dominating the market and dictating the rules.

The film interviews several different people who are working to make a change in how they treat food. I think I've seen several of these people in other food films before. They range from a farmer who is raising sustainable pork, beef, chickens, to a farmer running an urban farm in Milwaukee. The film also briefly introduced a neighborhood coop in Kansas which is providing healthy, local vegetables and fruits from local farms to grocery stores. Michael Pollan also makes brief comments about the food system throughout the film.

I think seeing alternative, healthy, and sustainable ways of farming and learning about how it makes a difference to society, community, the environment, and peoples' diets is so important. This film presents information in a clear and straightforward manner.",1349481600,9,1443,5.554545454545455

The pork farmer really was an eye opening with his story about almost dying from an unknown staph strain after getting gouge by one of this hogs. He took a huge step and eradicated his own herd. I think if some one can make that huge of an economic turn, I can definitely pay a few dollars more for my groceries. I have to drive further and make changes that are not as convenient, but it is really worth it knowing your making a difference with your wallet. I've gotten to know the farmers and it nice taking time out and just talking. We all need to really make this lifestyle change for the good of everyone and our communities. It gives you a bond with your community and it would be the death of the large corporation that prey on us for their greed. I've also taken up gardening which is very rewarding and relaxing.

4906439,5,B005YFGIZM,"In the words of Ana Joanes & The FRESH Team

The underground documentary that became a massive grassroots success, FRESH is the embodiment of the good food movement.

FRESH began as a grassroots effort for a grassroots movement, and it's been tremendously exciting to see the movie spread like wildfire. Within a month of our launch in April 2009, we received over 20,000 visitors and hundreds of screenings were organized. Today, FRESH is a community of over 100,000 advocates for healthier, more sustainable food, a film that's used all over the world as a platform to raise awareness and connect people to solutions in their community. But that's not good enough.

We want to make fresh food on every plate the norm, not the exception. We want to reach 1 million people: gardeners, doctors, politicians, teachers, eaters. Not just because that would be a nice boost to our ego (mine especially!), but because we believe that FRESH can truly help get us to a tipping point, when sustainable food will no longer be just a niche market.

Please support us by watching the movie, sharing it with a friend, and taking action in your own life. Help us reach 1 million people (to start with that is). Share your story and join us on Facebook & Twitter.

Together, we're taking back our food system.

It's all too obvious that government regulations and subsidies that support industrialized agriculture have created one of the greatest risks to our health.  The doc focuses on interviews with farmers, many of whom tried to go along with federal government programs and who found the system seriously flawed and foolish.
