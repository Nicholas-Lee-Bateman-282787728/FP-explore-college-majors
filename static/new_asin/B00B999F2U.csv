5564362,5,B00B999F2U,I love the series of these movies he has started.  I can't wait for the next one to it the market.,1368057600,,98,3.6666666666666665
5564363,3,B00B999F2U,"""Sometimes I wish I wasn't a judge."" The next chapter in the saga of wild west judge John Goodnight (Perry). While out riding John sees a stagecoach under attack and kills the attackers. The survivor is a woman who John strikes up a quick friendship with. Little by little he finds out more about her, and she may not be who he thought. I have seen all three movies in this series. The first one was actually not that bad, but the others went downhill fast. I can't really complain to much because they are hallmark channel TV movies so there is a certain expectation with that. The movie is sometimes entertaining and sometimes very boring. If it was more consistent it would have been better but just when you get into it it slows way down and makes you lose interest. If you have seen the others then you might as well watch this one too, otherwise its really a movie for hardcore western fans only. Overall, the third movie in the series and the third best one. I give it a C.",1364947200,,980,4.331521739130435

5564387,4,B00B999F2U,I enjoyed all three of the Goodnight western films. Luke Perry's acting made Goodnight come alive! The choice of locations for filming was great! So Western buff's go for all 3 of these film!,1374451200,,191,4.647058823529412
5564388,5,B00B999F2U,If you are a Luke Perry fan then this is the show for you.  It is like the old westerns used to be and well worth watching over and over. Luke Perry plays the part of John William Goodnight extremely well. This is a wonderful family movie and enjoyable for the whole family.,1372377600,,274,4.169811320754717
5564389,5,B00B999F2U,"Can't wait till Mr. Perry makes another""GOODNIGHT..""on the dvd features he talks of making another one. The young lady in this movie,Ms. Katharine Isabelle...was great. And it was very hard to keep your eyes off of her. I kept telling myself she reminds me of a child actor. I couldn't place the movie..right..so I checked out my movie collection & found her. It was back in 1991...a t.v.movie which starred the great CHARLES BRONSON..in..""YES VIRGINIA,THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS""...Ms. Isabelle was around ten years of age playing Richard ""THE WALTONS""Thomas's daughter. She has growth up to be a beauitful young lady. Hope Mr. Perry brings her back again. She played up to Goodnight pretty good. Collect it ...only if you LOVE THE WESTERN...it's truly a good one...it's the 3th one so far. Thankyou-Jack",1371513600,,801,5.030075187969925

5564392,5,B00B999F2U,"A perfect movie for anyone who loves westerns.  Luke Perry is excellent in this movie.  He carries his character all the way to the end as a believable judge in the west.  Little Ricky Schroder shocked me as a bad guy, and really pulled it off.",1368230400,,244,4.260869565217392
5564393,4,B00B999F2U,"I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE GOODNIGHT FOR JUSTICE SERIES FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS AND FIND THEM VERY ENTERTAINING. THIS VERSION WAS MORE ACTION PACKED AND ENTERTAINING.
