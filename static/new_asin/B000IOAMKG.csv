2659204,4,B000IOAMKG,"A nicely done film about Andrew Bird (Jason Carter), the notorious Edgar Allen Poe murderer, who leaves tips for the police based on Poe's writings.

As a juvenile Bird is arrested by Det. Burt Williams (Bill Vincent) and is sent away for committing brutal murders. During a transfer, Bird kills two guards and escapes. Burt spends three years trying to subdue Bird, which costs him his wife at Bird's hands. Finally after a recent disappearance of fashion model Heather Makepiece (Ambre Lake, in her movie debut) the FBI are brought in and Burt is told to step down. He does so reluctantly, retiring in to a bottle with the guilt of not being able to protect his wife.

The FBI investigation is led by none other than Det. Kris Williams (Anita LaSelva), who happens to be Burt's daughter. Kris discovers that Bird like to troll for victims in chat rooms, so she logs on as Annabel Lee in the hopes of luring him out. Her trick works and Bird bites almost immediately. Soon the FBI - through Annabel Lee - sets up a meeting with Bird, who picks a bowling alley as the location. Things go terribly wrong when instead of capturing Bird, Kris' partner is killed and Kris is abducted. Will daddy get sober enough to come to the rescue?

Meanwhile, a group of Burt's college students decide they want to go see the old house. With the typical we-drank-too-much-let's-go-do-something-stupid attitude, they head off in search of the infamous Bird house. Will they make it back to tell their story?

Like I said early, this movie was very well done. It kept your attention through the entire movie, and never seemed to drag too badly. Of course, with such indie films, there were some idiocies. The music in the beginning was too loud to create an atmosphere. Burt, the veteran police officer, seemed more scared of the gun he was carrying than coming face to face with the killer. He didn't seem to know how to hold it, and when it was knocked out of his hand he seemed a bit girlie. Overall, these are minor examples that can easily be overlooked by the next frame in the movie.

There was very good camera work during the shooting in the forest scenes. Very reminiscent of Helloween's Halloween video from the 80s. Very creepy. The gore effects were well done also, just enough without overdoing.

The only question I have after watching this movie is .....when do we get part two??",1169683200,16,2377,4.634204275534442
2659205,3,B000IOAMKG,"I had to check the credits 3 times to verify that Jeff Burton had a hand in this hackneyed 1950-60'ish, ""horror"" movie, but, It is still  refreshing to see any movie of this genre that doesn't have undead as the primary antagonist.",1413072000,,231,4.5

2659208,4,B000IOAMKG,"A good cloak and dagger type movie for those that are into that genre. The story is typical ""good guy, bad guy"" with an interesting twist. Fans of Edgar Allan Poe's works will enjoy this. The story moved along nicely and kept my attention. I can recommend this as a good movie. Check it out.",1398729600,,291,4.3090909090909095
2659209,1,B000IOAMKG,"Another low...low budget Indie that shows the difference between doing your homework and in this case ""not doing it"" on how to produce a good movie. The total inaccuracies of police and FBI protocols regarding family working a case where a family member is a victim and stakeout, backup, training and so on just boggles my mind. Then the character playing Poe using an English accent when Poe was born in Boston, Mass was pretty lame too.
 The writing, direction and acting by the majority was just plain bad, but some of the camera work and use of lighting in certain scenes was well done.
The only other good thing that came from this film(I use the term loosely) was Jennifer Lantz and what a cuttie she was playing a student named Layla Harrison. She didn't have a large role so I can't comment on her acting, but she sure was eazy on the eyes.
It was nice to see Dee Walace trying to add something to help this movie along and Spice Williams-Crosby as the Lt. who has done a lot of stunt work and on camera acting, but it was to little to late.
Their is a fair amount of violence (not very graphic), some decent gore, the f word and other four letter words thrown around (not that much though), pot smoking and a few scenes of female nudity.
Do yourself a favor and ""take a Pass on this DEAD END road""! -5 stars",1396569600,3,1316,4.327935222672065

2659213,1,B000IOAMKG,"The movie didn't  build enough mystery or suspense to keep my interest.  Some of the acting was amaturish, especially the cop turned professor.  This is one I wouldn't recommend.",1362787200,,178,5.068965517241379

I would rate this as 0 stars if I could!",1347062400,,313,4.508771929824562
8146541,2,B000IOAMKG,"*** 1-1/2 Stars *** Basically a grade 'z' flick, and even the Poe quotes can't save it.  It is barely entertaining, if you like poorly made 'horror' flicks.  I watched it to the end, and even that was disappointing.  Only gave it 1-1/2 stars because I did like the 'Poe' element, and the sometimes fun and literate, Victorian-style lines written for the killer.  But overall ... no.",1506643200,,382,4.656716417910448
