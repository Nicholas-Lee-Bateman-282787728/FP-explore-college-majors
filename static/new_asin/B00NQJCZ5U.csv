8679838,4,B00NQJCZ5U,"""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" (2014 release from Israel; 115 min.) brings the story of Viviane and Elisha Amsalem's divorce trial. As the movie opens, we are informed that Viviane left her husband three years ago, and that she is now trying to get a divorce (or ""gett"" in Hebrew). Viviane and her lawyer are in court, but Elisha refuses to appear, leading the judges to postpone the hearing.  We are then quickly informed it's ""six months later"", then ""two months later"", and then ""three months later"", with no end in sight. Will Viviane be able to get a divorce? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this movie is co-written and co-directed by Ronit Elkabetz (who also plays the role of Viviane) and Shlomi Elkabetz (whom I believe is her real-life husband). Second, 95% of the movie plays out in the court room, and as such is really more of a filmed stage play than it is a movie in the traditional sense. The movie consists is various family members and friends testifying as to why the divorce should, or should not, be granted. Third, most importantly, this movie spotlights the many absurdities of the Israeli court system, at least how it relates to divorce matters. The judges are rabbis and, most appallingly, the true power is held by the husband, who apparently must consent to granting the divorce. Without the husband's consent, not even the court can impose the divorce. In that sense, this movie demonstrates how easily a husband can (and does) abuse his wife psychologically, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. For that reason, I found the movie deeply disturbing, although I am also aware that, sadly, Israel is far from the only country where women are treated in this manner. Bottom line: ""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" is very much worth seeing, but let the viewer be aware: you may likely be pretty upset about what plays out in this Israeli divorce court drama.

I saw this movie recently at the Silverspot Cinema in Naples, FL. The early evening screening where I saw this at was quite nicely attended, which surprised me, given not only the nature of the movie, but also the theater-like style of the movie. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign divorce court drama that will challenge you in more ways than one, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1427155200,2,2462,4.694444444444445

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

In Israel, if a woman wants a divorce, she must go before a religious court and obtain a ""Gett"" from her husband--a document that permits the divorce only if the husband says so. You would think that a progressive society such as Israel would be up to date when it comes to divorce, but think again! ""Gett: The Trial of Vivian Ansalem,"" is a co-directed by brother and sister team, Shlomi and Ronit Elkabetz. Ronit plays the title character of Viviane who is pitted against her boorish husband, Elisha, who simply won't give into his wife's demand for a final separation.

""Gett"" is mainly set in a small, claustrophobic room where three rabbis officiate--there's a head rabbi, Salmion, who does most of the talking. The action doesn't take place over a few months--it's actually years before the case is resolved. The passage of time is indicated by inter-titles, generously interspersed throughout the film. The trial is often delayed due to the Elisha's refusal to show up. When he does show up, he's defended by his brother who the court refers to as a rabbi but later is exposed by the defense attorney, to lack full accreditation for such an appellation.

For the first few minutes, the camera focuses on the judges and then Elisha, but plaintiff Viviane is not shown. It becomes obvious that the opening of the film is symbolic of Viviane's treatment by the Court and the male Jewish society in general--she's clearly a second-class citizen. The judges in particular don't feel she's doing enough to effect a reconciliation with Elisha. Early on, despite her great distaste, she returns home and attempts again to work things out with her husband. But as everyone agrees, including family and neighbors, these two are simply not compatible. The judges also feel she's not modest enough for their tastes--when she lets her hair down during one point during the proceedings, the head rabbi admonishes her severely.

What's so fine about the screenplay is that both Viviane and Elisha are treated sympathetically. Elisha doesn't come off as a monster by any means--all parties agree that he was never physically violent toward his wife. Nonetheless, he's much more religious than Viviane and is unable to show affection. When Viviane finally testifies, she makes it clear that he has been engaged in attempting to psychologically humiliate her for years. The judges, despite their biases, also come off as fleshed out human beings. They seem truly interested in hearing both of the warring sides' stories but ultimately are too set in their ways to throw off a backward tradition.

In addition to the principals, the defense attorney Carmel fights an uphill battle against the triumvirate of biased judges. There's a great scene where he does an excellent job of questioning the wife of Elisha and Viviane's neighbors--she at first pictures herself as a credible, ""happily married"" wife. But after withering cross-examination, the woman is exposed as someone who's probably just as unhappy as Viviane in her relationship with her husband--a man who's really a tyrant, whom she is afraid of!

Some may regard ""Gett"" as a bit long, but for the patient film-goer, it's a fascinating dissection of marital discord. Things really come to a head when Elisha goes back on his word to end the marriage. And when he finally does agree to the Gett, he shows his misogynistic true colors by extracting a promise of sex from his exhausted wife.

Hopefully this film will lead to changes in divorce law in Israel. The positive aspects of Judaism are being dragged down by a slavish devotion to an archaic view of marriage and relationships.",1426723200,,3697,4.942028985507246

Filmmakers Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz's latest film is supposed to be the third in a trilogy films exploring male-controlled undercurrents in an Israeli family. However, the viewer need not have seen the other two films to be able to understand the subtext of their narrative. This film was exhibited at the 2014 London Film Festival under the `Dare' category and has since, in the case of the UK, gone straight to DVD.

This production has its attentions zeroed in on Viviane (played by director Ronit Elkabetz) and her five-year journey to obtain a divorce from her husband, after her 15 years of marriage. However, she is forestalled - in that in Israel, there is no a straightforward civil marriage or divorces. For a wife to wish to live her life independently it is wholly reliant on the acceptance of either her husband or the sternly conformist rabbinical courts to agree. This is a film, which at times has ridiculous hilarity of the human condition within the context at hand, and is countered with its heart-breaking humiliations. The filmmaker's approach in their direction takes an uncluttered and Spartan approach. The narrative conveys the atmosphere of rigidity in the courtroom - right down to the strict and appropriate dress code. All the film's scenes take place in the courtroom, a small claustrophobic room with white walls. It is the former wife Viviane - who is the key issue of the piece, and Elkabetz's portrayal is one to be applauded - as we see her go through frustration after frustration and her resilience.

One of the themes that really got under my skin was the fact that the court session cannot get underway until the husband is present! By using this stratagem Elisha played by (Simon Abkarian) declines to present himself in court. He uses his influence to delay the court in order to wear out his wife and force her to withdraw her annulment request. In reality, this tactic is unfortunately used by Israeli men who want a postponement or curtail a divorce, and is a cognitive act of revenge, or a way to illicit child custody.

For me a `Gett' offers a deeply troubling view of a system whereby misogyny seems, as if it is, codified into the court system.

A rabbi has gone on trial in the United States accused of plotting to abduct Jewish men who refused to grant their wives a divorce(""Get"").
