8064716,3,B0009PE700,"This box set is mysterious, because Amazon and several other dealers listed it as ""out of print"" before it was ever made available. You cannot order it, but it does show up in bargain bins. I believe, and this is just my theory, that a legal problem arose over the inclusion of The Sandy Frank owned versions of Gamera Vs. Gaos and Gamera Vs. Zigra.  The earlier, and superior, version of Gamera vs. Gaos called ""Return of the Giant Monsters"" is apparently in the public domain, but Gamera vs. Zigra was only ever distributed in the US by Sandy Frank. If anyone out there knows the story behind this box set. Please comment.",1173830400,3,624,4.522123893805309
8064717,2,B0009PE700,"This release is the kind that you would find in the 1.99 or less bin at Media Play. The picture and audio quality is poor, and the films themselves aren't the cream of the crop when it comes to kaiju movies. ""Gappa the Triphibian Monster"" is a laughably bad movie, but I recommend buying the Media BLasters release instead. It has the original Japanese audio and the dubbed version, while also being of a better picture quality. The Gamera films are not as fun to laugh at, but rather just annoying. They are, however, great for the younger kaiju fans. These releases are in horrible condition, as the print is very grainy. So to be blunt, the films are bad and the DVD's are bad. I suggest that if the buyer wants some better, more serious kaiju movies they check out the Godzilla movies from the 50's and 60's as well as the newer ones, which have great special effects and much better acting than this trash.",1142985600,5,911,4.461077844311378
