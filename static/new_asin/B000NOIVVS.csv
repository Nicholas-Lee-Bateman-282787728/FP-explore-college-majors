2774563,5,B000NOIVVS,"This is one of those children's series that I can actually watch with the kids and laugh right along with them. I like this version much better than the older claymation which we also own, but more importantly, the kids like it and will watch it over, and over and.......",1178409600,8,271,4.44

2774630,4,B000NOIVVS,"My children and I love all the PBS curious George episodes!  Except be aware of one episode on this DVD with George afraid of the dark. He imagines images of monsters, and it actually gave my 3 year old nightmares for weeks!  My son is still afraid of the dark now ever since watching that episode.

2774633,3,B000NOIVVS,"I should have read the description better. I thought this was a feature film but it turns out this DVD contains a series of Curious George TV episodes. The kids still love it but it's not what I thought it was, especially given the cover on the DVD.",1296950400,,249,4.208333333333333
2774634,5,B000NOIVVS,I love Curious George!  My grandchildren love Curious George too.  I feel it is enjoyable as well as educational.  This was a brand new DVD.  The shipping was fast and well packed. Would purchase from this seller again.,1289692800,,219,4.684210526315789
2774635,5,B000NOIVVS,We have bought six Curious George movies so far and love them!  I have a four-year-old and 18-month-old.  They love watching George and then trying the experiments that the real kids do after the show.  I like that they teach something in each cartoon.,1282348800,,252,4.681818181818182

2774638,5,B000NOIVVS,"my son loves george. so instead of always having to wait until the tv says it's time to watch him, i bought this.
well, not only is it super cute but it lasts forever! ok, about 2 hours? i don't even know, i'd have to go check. and i'm not going to. but the point is, my son adores it so much that even after watching the WHOLE THING he would literally start it all over again. so i had to unplug the tv so he would realize ""no more"" because he's too little to know what ""no more"" means :) very satisfied. totally worth the price!",1227139200,,530,3.9626168224299065
2774639,5,B000NOIVVS,"Litle George, always good things with Geroge. He goes on a lot of Adventures and kids love that, then watching a little Monkey kids love that to. He has great Storys for little and older kids also.",1214697600,,197,4.351351351351352

2774653,5,B000NOIVVS,This DVD has hours of fun episodes from everyone's favorite monkey curious george.  In addition there are also printable coloring sheets and computers games.  My daughter really enjoys this DVD.,1198800000,,194,5.433333333333334
2774654,5,B000NOIVVS,"I got this DVD for my 2 year old.  He loves it! It is true that everytime the ""afraid of the dark episode"" shows he wants to be close to me, but he actually asks to watch it sometimes. If you are the kind of parent that do not  select the ""play all the episodes"" button and previews the DVD's, you can skip that one. The episodes in general are very creative and fun and it is worth the money. So I would say: Don't miss all the other good episodes because of the dark one, you can always skip that, plus it is a very cheap DVD for the entertainment. My son really loves it!",1196294400,,574,3.939655172413793
2774655,1,B000NOIVVS,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves Curious George and we already owned the Zoo Night DVD so when this came out it seemed like a no brainer.  Unfortunately, once he saw the ""Dark"" video our lives were turned upside down. He became afraid of the dark and monsters. He was truly petrified at bedtime to the point of being almost hysterical.  It took about 5 or 6 weeks (and numerous books, conversations with his pediatrician and calls to other moms) but he is finally sleeping through the night! All of this because of the ""Dark"" episode on this video. I had to tell my son the garbage man came and took this dvd and crushed it and took it to the landfill. I only gave it one star because even if the other episodes are fine it is not worth the pain it caused us.",1194307200,22,754,4.157534246575342
2774656,5,B000NOIVVS,"My wife and I do not favor much television for children, but there are times it is suitable.  Our two-year old is simply wild about this Curious George series.  It is not only entertaining, but CG solves problems and learns things in each episode, that the child can learn with him, so his parents are wild about it, too!  From the lessons to the voices to the animation -- even the theme music -- all is very well done.  Highly recommended.",1190160000,10,441,4.407407407407407
2774657,5,B000NOIVVS,"I loved reading the Curious George books when I was a kid.  I was thrilled when i found out that it was coming to pbs.

I liked the movie, but I really LOVE this animated series.  My kids really enjoy watching this and I watch it along with them.  It really is a great series and I was impressed the first time I saw it last September (2006).",1189900800,,342,3.985294117647059
2774658,5,B000NOIVVS,"I Have to sons who are 6 and 5.  I love watching this monkey with my boys.  They laugh so loud and hard sometimes.  The makers of Curios George Have a great product, it's both fun and educational.  Perfect match for growing kids, not boring or stupid as some kid shows.  Also no annoying songs.",1189468800,2,294,4.2727272727272725
2774659,5,B000NOIVVS,My son has been watching the series since he was six months old. It is one of two that he watches. He loves the bright colors and I like the lessons. I do try to watch each episode before he does so that I can make sure it is ok but have never had a problem.,1187654400,,258,3.625
2774660,5,B000NOIVVS,Love Curious George on PBS Kids.  Was very excited to find the series on DVD.  My 4yo loves watching these in the morning before daycare.  Great product for the money.,1185235200,,167,4.5
2774661,3,B000NOIVVS,"I was dissapointed with one of the episodes on this DVD which was ""George in the dark"". My 3 years old never had any problems sleeping in the dark until he saw this movie. It teaches little children to be afraid of the dark instead of teaching them to be brave and get over fears they could have.

Since my son watched that movie it has been a nightmare for all of us when is bedtime. I think people should be a little more carefull when they are managing a little child's mind.",1184630400,10,478,4.139784946236559

8180033,5,B000NOIVVS,"We are not cable tv people, and enjoyed several seasons of Curious George on Netflix for a long time. It's no longer available there, so I found these DVDs to take their place. This one features two of his favorite stories, which were at one time combined into a single episode. When PBS got ahold of them, they added this awful segment after each story with a really obnoxious opening statement: ""Curious George is a monkey, so he does things you *can't* do."" First, that doesn't make sense. He does outrageous things because he's a fictional cartoon, not because he's a monkey, and he does a lot of things only a fictional monkey could accomplish. It makes no sense to not tell children the real reasons why. In fact, it's bizarre.

After that weird intro, it switches gears to children doing busy things with lots of camera angle changes and background noise, and it completely throws off the calm, peaceful tone set by the show. Some parents may like this added feature, but I hate it. The type of noise produced by it heightens my anxiety and is entirely unappealing to me.

Overall, I still recommend this show to any parent of a young child, and especially the stories on this particular DVD. Space monkey and train monkey are a huge hit around my house ;)",1475539200,2,1263,4.584070796460177
8180034,5,B000NOIVVS,"My daughter loves and I mean loves anything curious George. I have been purchasing these here and there and I am so glad that Amazon has these. These little movies can keep my daughter busy and also learn for hours.
I highly recommend these.",1474156800,,241,4.5
8180035,5,B000NOIVVS,"It's hard to say something is classic when you remember the REAL classic Curious George, however, these episodes are very good, and foster curiosity (sorry, had to say it) about space.",1462233600,,184,4.967741935483871
8180036,5,B000NOIVVS,"We love George and this one is no exception.  We watch George at night after books when ""settling down"". I love that the episodes are short, educational and safe to watch. My kids love George and the educational follow-up after each show.",1428624000,,238,4.666666666666667
8180037,5,B000NOIVVS,Purchased for my daughter's preschool class and all the kids love it.  Shipped quickly and well packaged.,1417305600,,105,5.176470588235294
