916269,5,6304718705,"I have owned this production on VHS for several years and

primarily bought it because it features music by

Tangerine Dream. The video itself has nothing to do with

Tangerine Dream but has views of the Grand Canyon like I

have never seen before. The aerial fly over shots are

something to see.

If the Grand Canyon is what you're wanting to see, then this

DVD is worth a look and hopefully you will become a fan of

Tangerine Dream music as well.

There is another DVD about the Grand Canyon that also features

music by Tangerine Dream called ""Oasis"".  It has some of the

great photography in it as well, but also has Thunderstorms &

flashfloods.

If you do become a fan of Tangerine Dream after watching both

of these videos, there is a CD of both titles.

The Canyon Dreams CD has 2 addtional tracks on it that are not

on the video.",1141948800,12,844,4.341935483870968
916270,4,6304718705,"I had the opportunity to see this shortly after it was originaly produced. I have personally been to the canyon several times and even went down it once. This video does a good job of bringing to light the experiences I had  perviously. It is an excellent presentation demonstrating much artistry in  the capturing and editing of the scenes filmed.
Even more so than the  video, I particularly enjoy the music. The composition and performance is  top notch. It easily ranks among my favorite pieces of music. What more  needs to be said?
The only real drawback for this video is the poor  quaility of the transfer. The video is slightly grainy (it can easily be  ignored by the average viewer) but what I find as inexcusable is the audio  being overmodulated in several sections. Particularly noticable at the  start of the first and third segments of this picture. Its as if no one  bothered to listen to the master after the transfer was complete. In  looking at the above reviews, the concensus (and as you see, I agree for  the most part) is that a spectular presentation was rendered less so by  poor attention to detail in transfering the picture to DVD.
It would  almost be worth it to me to buy a VHS copy, if it were availible.",959644800,5,1236,4.5590909090909095
916271,3,6304718705,"This DVD contains just less than 40 minutes of dazzling imagery, filmed in and around the Grand Canyon by Camera One Productions. The material is divided into 6 chapters, each following a particular (graphical) theme and  accompanied by the haunting melodies by premier synthesiser group Tangerine  Dream. Originally made in 1987, the picture quality is rather poor by DVD  standards and particularly so in low light situations, where the grain  often becomes quite intrusive. More care has been taken with the  soundtrack, presented here in PCM 48kHz 16-bit stereo and in many ways,  this is more of a music video than it is a travel or nature film. Fans of  Tangerine Dream's music may, therefore, get more out of this disc than will  lovers of the spectacular scenery of the American Southwest. Attentive TD  fans may flinch a little, though, at the clumsy overdubs to which the music  for the opening chapter, `Shadow Flyer', has been subjected in order to  make it cue better to the flow of images. (For a full review of the  soundtrack music, check out the CD section of Amazon.)
Overall, I found  this is a rather disappointing release. Both music and images are weaker  than those in the later (and very similar) disc, ""Oasis"", from the same  forces-although it has to be said that the two combine better here than  they do on the subsequent release.
(Incidentally, this disc has no region  encoding on it and will play on any DVD player.)",950745600,4,1447,4.793522267206478
916272,4,6304718705,See the Grand Canyon from your living room. Segments include beautiful fly over views of the canyon.  Including everybodys favorite Havasu Falls! Instrumental music by Tangerine Dream adds to the experience.  Grainy slow  motion picture is the only drawback. This is a one of a kind DVD!,915062400,,287,5.0638297872340425

7876387,5,6304718705,"As with "" Oasis "" , this is soundtrack music . It is well written , and compliments some stunning photography.

Although reasonably short , forty minutes , it holds your attention throughout.

I can recommend this DVD to anyone who follows this group , who are musical trailblazers..........",1378512000,,291,4.918367346938775

7876390,5,6304718705,"So it gets five stars.  The DVD was originally a VHS release and the transfer must have been from the same.  Consider the year it was released and don't purchase this if you're looking for something that would compare with what gets produced today.  Purchase this if you're looking for a fine Tangerine Dream album with some very cool visuals to go along.  Had this in VHS format.  Bought the DVD when it was first released years ago.  It has different packaging now.  This DVD is not for everybody.  Play this one in the dentist office, preferably with the monitor mounted on the ceiling.",1231632000,,589,4.596153846153846

7876392,3,6304718705,"The photography in this DVD is very good.  What spoils it is the music.  For some reason I find it very harsh sounding in the first half of the DVD.  The second half it sounds much more relaxing.  I wouldn't expect a person to be able to relax to the first half of this DVD.  Many new scenes suddenly pop up as well as bold, loud blasts of music.  I play it with the sound off.",1192492800,2,377,3.8947368421052633
