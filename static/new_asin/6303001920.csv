7833509,4,6303001920,"The project of a German film crew (sans narrative v/o, thank god!), this documentary allows you to hear and see the century's most delightfully opinionated American man of letters. His opinions would, of course, annoy,  if they weren't so very often perfectly accurate (and always entertainingly  delivered). Vidal once remarked that he never misses an opportunity to have  sex or appear on TV, and he is obviously playing to the camera in parts.  It's truly delicious. Topics he covers include everything from the demise  of the novel, to the prudishness and arrogance of Christianity, the  absurdity of Richard Nixon, and even Vidal's efforts to thwart RFK's Senate  run.  Vidal's ""Kahlki"" was coming out at about the same time this  documentary was made; as a result Vidal waxes even more apocyliptic than  usual, and this will disappoint some viewers, I suspect. Also, I could have  done without the footage--however brief--from Feninni's ""Roma""  (the editors don't show that bit which includes Vidal's cameo!) and  ""Myra Breckinridge.""  Despite the project's low production value,  the cinematography is good to very good, and includes shots of Vidal's  properties in Rome and Ravello. The theme music is very surprising, but  somehow effective. Vidal's Truman Capote imitation alone is worth the price  of admission. If you've ever enjoyed any of Vidal's writings or are even  the slightest of fans, this video is a must-have.  (A great  teaching/classroom resource, too.)",935366400,10,1478,5.2844827586206895
