8531649,3,B008X8RF36,I was so looking forward to this since she was raised to sainthood this year and wanted to show this to school kids.  As an adult I had a hard time staying focused due to the slow moving nature of the presentation. It will not work for children under 10 years-old.  The costuming looks high schoolish and the dialog is very difficult to understand.,1352073600,,348,4.421875

I am sure this production company has done wonderful videos of other Saints. But this is not one of them. I was hoping this video would help me and my students learn more about Kateri's life. Unfortunately, this video was a huge disappointment. I am so glad I previewed the video before showing it!

I am no expert on Kateri or Native American History, especially the tribes of the Iroquoi Confederation during the 1600's. But I am confused when I see
pictures and paintings of the Plains Indians, tee-pees and the Rocky Mountains. I am pretty sure that Kateri stayed in the northeast, by the present day New York/Canada border. It is my understanding that Mohawks lived in longhouses at that time, not tee-pees. And the painting that comes on the screen when talking about the black robes stopping by Kateri's longhouse is puzzling. It looks like a European American fort, with cottages atop mounds of earth and surrounded by fencing. I am so sorry, but the fake Halloween wigs are so bad, it is distracting. Couldn't the word ""pagan"" be used to describe non-Christian Native Americans? ""Heathen"" seems so offensive! The England country side is lovely, but the endless footage of the same creek and field is boring. I am sure it would put my students to sleep. I am so sorry to give this review. But after the excitement of finding a movie about Kateri and receiving it so quickly, the movie itself was a huge dissapointment. I am sure the actors, directors and producers are lovely people. I just think they needed to do more research, edit out more of the creek and field scenes, include different music and ditch the bad wigs.",1351123200,,1740,4.683006535947713
8531651,2,B008X8RF36,"This review was actually for this company's Saint Kateri DVD. I was looking forward to watching this DVD, but was very disappointed.  The documentary appears to have been done on a very low budget, and is poorly written, poorly filmed, and poorly acted.  The actors wear wigs, which look fake, and the actors don't appear to be even a little Native American.  The scenery is beautiful at times, at other times it seems out of place (i.e. not quite the scenery that Kateri would have known).  Native Americans are referred to as ""heathens,"" a disturbingly derogatory name by today's standards.  I'm sure the producers meant well, but the DVD just isn't worth the money. The DVD gets two stars instead of one simply because it's about Saint Kateri.",1350691200,,746,4.796875
8531652,5,B008X8RF36,"This DVD is a wonderful attempt to explain the life of Kateri Tekakwitha. It is part acted and part documentary, very interesting to devotees of soon-to-be Saint Kateri. We need to know about the lives of heroic holy people to give us inspiration and encouragement to follow the way of Jesus Christ. Kateri fulfills this well.",1348099200,3,326,4.839285714285714
