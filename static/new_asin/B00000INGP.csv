7911102,1,B00000INGP,"Amazon has screwed up this listing by mixing up two films with the same name, and featuring the names of both directors and both sets of people who appear.  This one here as of this date is a fictional piece about a punk band in LA.  I returned it without watching.

I don't know if this film is a deliberate effort to rip people off, but Amazon is not helping with the screwed up listing.  I have advised them of this but so far not worth their attention.",1354406400,5,456,4.1477272727272725
7911103,3,B00000INGP,"I looked up Johnny Thunders here on Amazon,and this movie was on the list. Maybe since he has a song by the same name it added it to the list.",1331769600,,142,3.7666666666666666
7911104,1,B00000INGP,This is not the Johnny Thunders documentary ''Born to Lose: The Last Rock N Roll Movie'' This is another punk rock doc. Do not get confused. The Thunders film is very hard to get. Your lucky if you get a 3rd generation copy of it for $100.,1123977600,21,239,4.1063829787234045
7911105,5,B00000INGP,"""With a title like ""Born To Lose"" you can't expect this film to be a light sunny romp.  What you get is a dark and gloomy look at the life of a struggling group of musicians trying to have some fun.  They lurch from gig to gig, having their share of problems with drugs, money, women and just life in general.  It has the raw feeling of real life without getting sentimental or preachy.  The lead singer of the band, played by Joseph Rye, has a wicked drug problem that is almost as bad as his acidic personality.  Like Johnny Thunders for sure.  He's not the sort of person you want to have around unless you enjoy watching train wrecks or following ambulances.  I can't say I ever felt bad for him after all the crap lands his way because he is his own worst enemy.  But I did feel like it was real and I got involved with the struggle.  There are a number of references to the Dolls and Thunders, besides the film title... ""Looking for a new bass player that sounds like Billy Rath.""  Although this is the story of an LA based band not NYC like the Heartbreakers.  Lech Kowalski's new film has a title that is very similar to this one (Born To Lose: The Last Rock & Roll Movie) and they deal with similar themes.  But it would be a shame to miss this one because of the similar names.  This film was released before the Kowalski picture and owes nothing to it.  Similar but different.  If you like one, you'll like the other.",1025136000,2,1428,4.237037037037037
