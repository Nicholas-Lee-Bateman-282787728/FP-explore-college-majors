8103074,3,B000DZY7U6,"Dubbed in English.  It has a decent story about a security service company that was escorting a box of treasures and bags of silver cash.  A group of bandits murders the security guards and buries them except one guard gets away, and the bandits take the treasure to the black market to sell it to a bad clan chief.  However, the small bandits gambled part of the silver cash away along with a bag that has the security company's name on it.  The bad clan chief refused to buy the treasure unless the guy who won the bag of silver cash is captured or killed so that there is no evidence that this stuff was stolen.  So, the bandits go in search of the gambler.  In doing so, the gambler steals another bag of silver cash and later bumps into the remaining security guard.  That security guard was saved by a rich guy.  In addition, that security guard was trained by a kung-fu master who used to be the rich guy's friend.  Fate brought the four together, and each with their own reasons wanted to destroy the bandits and the bad clan chief who has contracted Japanese body guards.  That's how you get all the kung-fu fight scenes.  Okay story and average fight scenes.",1501718400,,1168,4.411214953271028
8103075,4,B000DZY7U6,"Another old school classic! I remember this & Water Margin playing as a double feature back in the day. Ah, the days of 2 movies for 1 price...

This one features a team of Jimmy Wang Yu, Chen Sing, Chang Yi & Kam Kong. The plot seems to be a common one among the genre: baddies controlling the town, no one willing to oppose them until a hero (or several in this case) take a stand against them. In fact, it's very similar to the Savage 5 which came out the very same year. The baddies include Lung Fei, Shan Mao & a Japanese dude with an abundance of hand fans & a few barrel-headed disciples. There's plenty of fighting throughout with a big showdown at the end which involves a chicken coop. Overall, a worthy must see for kung fu fans!",1491264000,,740,4.211267605633803
8103076,4,B000DZY7U6,"I wasn't actually expecting much from this movie. Jimmy Wang Yu directs this movie and stars in it. He shines in both ways with his . great cocky attitude and impressive fighting. Two of the four lead characters are lesser known to me, but I thought they were good too. Well-known martial arts star, Chen Sing, played a down on his luck martial artist who was too afraid to fight after he ended up in jail after his last fight. He spends more time acting despondent than fighting but did a good job at both.

The plot is basically a couple of bad guys who are backed up by the local bad boys target all of these guys individually and beat them up. The good guys band together for a showdown, they kick butt and take names. Having four lead characters ran the risk of making the movie too scattered, but the character development and intertwining of the stories of all four makes it work really well.",1476489600,,899,4.383233532934132

8103078,3,B000DZY7U6,"This is a bit different Hong Kong police crime drama as the police group is made up of a team of young Interpol Agents with differing skills, all good looking, who try to catch a group of criminals aided by Sammo Hung and the Hong Kong police force including a part played by Simon Yam.  There is a lot of action in the movie, shoot outs and overt violence, some may say overly violent.  The main caveat I have about this movie is that I just HATED the part played by Michael Biehn, he had the flattest, most one dimensional character I think I may ever have encountered in a Hong Kong movie. His speech was monotone throughout and he seemed like a cardboard cut out character more than a truly bad guy. That being said it still was not a bad movie and is worth one viewing, I would give it about 3.5 stars. It is the same movie as one called Dragon Heat.",1335225600,,855,4.175757575757576
8103079,4,B000DZY7U6,"Young Interpol agents collected from several Asian countries fight the bloody battle against the gangsters over the kidnapped criminals. The premise of `Maang lung' (`Dragon Squad') is not a very complicated one, and for all intense and violent actions, you can't say director Daniel Lee (Jet Li's `Black Mask') did any groundbreaking achievement in it. Still `Dragon Squad' is pretty watchable actioner with interesting cast gathering for this film.

As I said, the premise is simple. After a botched mission, five young cops (played by Vanness Wu, Shawn Yue, Shengyi Huang, Lawrence Chou, and Yu Xia respectively) stand up and fight the international crime syndicate led by a gangster Ko (Jun-ho Heo). Sammo Hung plays a veteran cop who works with younger police agents while Michael Biehn (yes, the guy who fought Governor of California in `The Terminator') appears as a hired mercenary fighting for Ko. The film's sub-plots include a romance, a family-ties, and so on, but the film's strength lies in the fierce action sequences that come with lots of bullets and bucketfuls of blood.

In addition to the cast members above, some faces familiar in Hollywood films like Simon Yam (`Tomb Raider 2"") and Maggie Q (""Mission Impossible III"") also appear. It must be said they are typecast (Simon Yam as the police commander, Maggie Q as the deadly sniper), but they did fine performance as well as the main cast. A bit more surprising is Bingbing Li, who was seen in Chinese film `Purple Butterfly' as a girl quietly reading a book in a tram. She plays a different kind of role here, and is still effective at that.

The film features a couple of big and loud group battles between the cops and the criminal, and during the scenes they use such weapons as guns, grenades, and rifles with a scope. These action scenes are, it is reported, very costly, and `Dragon Squad' will not disappoint you if you're looking for the bullets flying like a rain. it deserves the name of a big-budget film (for Hong-Kong film, of course), but the actions are mostly gripping.

Still, the film suffers from its a bit silly plot holes: some cops, it is told, traveled to Hong Kong to deliver the testimony and evidences at the beginning of the film. So why don't they just go back to their country after doing that? Justice or friendship is not a strong reason enough. The sub-plots are not particularly interesting, and the suggested love story of Michael Biehn's character looks weak, and fails to convince. Clearly the film's script tries to be character-driven, but its intentions are often overshadowed by too much violence in the action scenes. This is not to say all the characters are flat. The villains are pretty successful in showing the pathos at the end of the film, but if you're looking for the intensity of `Heat' in which Al Pacino confronts DeNiro, you should watch something else.

`Dragon Squad' is an average action flick with big, flashy, and extremely violent actions with frantic camera work. And it is co-produced by Steven Seagal (but why??)",1161820800,4,3048,4.8538461538461535
8103080,4,B000DZY7U6,"I would rate this 3.5 stars, and Geforce,(guy who did a review earlier)This is not better than SPL!!! To be honest, I bought this dvd because of MAGGIE Q.(from NAKED WEAPON)

The film was pretty decent, good stylish action, and solid plot. However, it felt like the so-called ""DRAGON SQUAD"" has more style than substance. The bad guys carried this movie, except for Sammo Hung, the good guy actors seem a bit miscasted. The film is about a rivalry and struggle against a crime lord. They all want the same thing, but different means to reach an end. There is also drama between Biehn's character and Ann(ex-girlfriend of the crimelord)Sammo Hung's group seems outmatched against Michael Biehn's squad. The gun fights had the familiar cross between John Woo and Johnnie To style. The martial arts fight with Sammo and the general was short but pretty well done.

The film wasn't at all bad, it was entertaining but it didn't immerse me in the scenes. It was too stylish that it lacked depth. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. I think I made a mistake of watching it after re-watching SPL and INFERNAL AFFAIRS.

The imported HK dvd I have is great. HD picture and DTS sound, I can't complain. The film is worth a look if you are a big fan of asian action. Rent first, since everyone has different tastes. It is still a well-made flick.

8103081,4,B000DZY7U6,"I bought this dvd because of Michael Biehn.  His character's relationship with both his right-hand man and his love interest Ching ringed with sincerity and honesty in stark contrast to the cold and mechanical acting by the rest of the cast.  I was so impressed by Mr. Biehn that I search and found his fan club website ([...]) and joined.  I will be seeing him live at the fan gathering in Burbank, CA in June 2006.  There are other versions of this dvd which contain additional material.",1140652800,3,489,4.586206896551724

P/S: This movie definitely better than SPL!",1139097600,3,250,4.813953488372093
