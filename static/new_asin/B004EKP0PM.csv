8427163,5,B004EKP0PM,Max & Ruby are such cute bunnies that tell a story and in a gentle and kind way. No hostility like Sponge Bob.,1364774400,,110,3.8260869565217392
8427164,3,B004EKP0PM,"One of my grandsons loves Max and Ruby but after sitting through each episode about 100 times, I've really come to dislike Ruby. She's a poor example for toddlers: she's always focused on what she wants, telling Max ""later"" or telling Max to find something else to do so she can be with her Bunny Scout friends. If Max wants to sled, Ruby insists on building a snowman, etc. It doesn't matter that Max is right when Ruby insists he's wrong and she eventually comes to realize he was right and accepts his help. The lesson that's actually being taught is that it's okay to put yourself first. I let my grandson watch this because he likes Max so much and the adventures he gets into but we always discuss Ruby's bad behavior. If you're new to Max and Ruby, you'll enjoy watching the episodes with your little ones but I think you'll also find she gets to be very annoying after a while. Also, isn't it a little creepy that they live alone in their house while grandma has her own but there are no parents?",1362182400,2,1004,4.374331550802139
