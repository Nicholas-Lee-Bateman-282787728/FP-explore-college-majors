8575825,3,B00BZHPM0K,"This film is an interesting perspective of the political conditions in Germany after the first world war. It  reminds me that history cannot be looked at in a vacuum . Granted it is a Nazi propanda film, but as someone stated in a previous review most films during this period could be viewed as such. That  of course  includes Hollywood films. Having said that the film was heavily edited and scenes jump a lot. I believe we can thank the propanda minister for that.",1530316800,,467,4.535714285714286
8575826,5,B00BZHPM0K,This film is very interesting. It is a impression about Weimarer Republic.,1513296000,,74,5.25
8575827,4,B00BZHPM0K,"By no means the brilliant piece of film-making that some would have you believe, Hans Westmar is nevertheless an interesting film for a number of reasons:
1) The many crowd and fight scenes are very realistic. Hundreds (thousands?) of extras engage in street fights, parades, rallies, etc. These are often so realistic that they appear to be documentaries.
2) This is an eye-opening look at how the Nazis were viewed (and viewed themselves) in 1933. Way before the horrors of the holocaust and WWII, the Nazis often saw themselves as the only bulwark against communism. Indeed, we forget how close Germany was to being turned communist by the enormous red influence running wild in government and the streets. Also, in 1933, many joined the Nazis out of nationalistic loyalty and anxiety about some very real problems.  How many would have done so if they knew where the party would eventually go can only be speculated. But in 1929-33, it is doubtful that many could guess with any precision. I find that many young people  think that WWII was fought to stop the holocaust (it wasn't), and that they have no idea why the Nazis became so popular or what Germany was doing from 1929 - WWII. They seem to think that the Nazis just appeared overnight in 1940 and that the Germans had no motive for supporting them in such large numbers except for anti-semitism. Economic, nationalistic, political concerns appear to have been forgotten or erased. This film shows how real the communist threat was in those early days.
So, by no means a great film, this is very interesting, gripping at times, and gives us a look at this period from  a viewpoint we seldom see.",1464220800,10,1657,4.7665505226480835
8575828,5,B00BZHPM0K,"Sorry, but this goes far beyond simple propaganda. Having studied the utter, multifaceted despair Germany was mired in between the end of WWI and the late 1920s, it is absolutely astounding that the communists were not able to exploit the financial and networking advantages they had. Thankfully, it was a strength within the people that they ultimately rejected communism and reversed their economic woes by casting-off the international zionist bankers.
Hans Westmar is actually an extremely accurate depiction of what Germany was like. It was utter chaos and the soul of the nation was at stake... to begin with. When you consider Germany's unmistakable stand AGAINST communism, they inadvertently saved not only portions of eastern Europe, but much of the west as well. I was very impressed with the scenes showing what the bolshevik get togethers were like and how National Socialists were really ""up against it"" day and night, for the communists were not only led by an organized cabal of jewish Soviets, but they were funded as well by this same multinational cabal. All of this is quite honestly shown, so for anyone who feels uncomfortable with this reality, you may want to face that simple fact after doing some research.
The direction of the film is great for that era, but the editing was probably the worst of any of Germany's 1930-1945 films. It's almost as though the original print skipped or was poorly maintained. From what I understand, the film went through several drafts. In my opinion, too many cooks in the kitchen can be a catastrophe in film making. Although this did not destroy the film, it did make it a tad confusing as far as the flow of the plot. Occasionally one scene will segue into the next with a ""thud"" literally. Emil Lohkamp's performance was passionate and top-notch for the 1930s style. You'll find the riot scenes to be a surprisingly impressive quality. Also of note, are the marching/demonstration scenes, which are so well choreographed that many viewers thought stock or news footage was used.
I overall enjoy Germany's films during this period and ""Hans Westmar"" -- while not being the best, in my opinion -- is still a terrific and very impressive, passionately executed film.",1462665600,4,2226,4.970509383378016
8575829,5,B00BZHPM0K,Received this very quickly and found this DVD to be of the highest quality. Superb deluxe edition with English subtitles make this Third Reich film one of the best. I have previously seen Hans Westmar only in poor quality without subtitles but this one tops them all. Greetings from England.,1457049600,4,291,4.84

8575832,5,B00BZHPM0K,"Just  where did IHF get this print?The quality of picture and sound are outstanding!

A semi-fictionalised biography of Horst Wessel,renamed in the film Hans Westmar. Most of the other characters in the film,such as Frau Salm and Camillo Ross keep their original names (yes,they really existed!].Technically,the cinematography is brilliant,especially in the representation of riot and disorder. It's propaganda,of course,but never boring and fascinating to watch giving,as it does,a unique insight into events that occurred only five years earlier.

Probably one of my most favourite film. From a purely aesthetic point of view I can't fault it.",1384646400,12,645,5.697916666666667
