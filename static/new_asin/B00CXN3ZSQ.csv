The title and cover, I agree, is misleading its audience to expect another type martial arts systems.  The original title, ""Voices of the Masters: Warrior Arts of the Philippines"", and its cover images of the Filipino Martial Arts of Arnis, Eskrima and Kali, was the original package until sold to a professional marketing company to help market.  Unfortunately, there were a few items missed in the translation.  As the adage would say, ""don't judge the book by its cover"" does apply here.

I would highly recommend this this DVD to anyone practicing FMA anywhere in the world.  Of the 24 hours of film footage taken at various locations in the Philippines (In the islands of Luzon, Visayan and Mindanao) and many interviews with Filipino Masters and Grandmasters from various systems and styles, we were only able to utilize less than 90 minutes in this Award-Winning featured film.  VOTM won the New York International Film Festival in the Spring of 2010 for Sports Documentary.  The VOTM is meant to be a trilogy.  Unfortunately, the two films are still in the project pending more financing.  We at VOTM look forward to someday completing the entire series to show the world the FMA as it was taught and how it is taught today all over the world.

8587275,1,B00CXN3ZSQ,"I viewed this documentary film on Amazon Prime. Not much here. A bunch of different instructors talking a lot but little to no explanation of history, culture, or techniques. And the name is misleading. It's all about Filipino Martial Arts only. Your money would be better spent on The Bladed Hand or Eskrimadors.",1446595200,,313,4.9245283018867925
8587276,5,B00CXN3ZSQ,"This is an excellent documentary that gives a glimpse into the forbidden realms of Filipino fighting practices. You definitely get a sense that others have not been allowed to film these training sessions. All I can say is ""wow"".",1384128000,,229,4.897435897435898
