8101029,5,B000CR7U9A,"For everyone who loves to fly fish and for those who love the Madison this is a must watch.  Kelly Galloup is truly a nice guy and he knows fishing particularly nymphing.  Watch this and you'll be making your reservation, whether you call the Slide Inn for a guide or not you'll want to stop by for a drink and visit with Kelly.  Ask him about the brown trout that got him, a good reason to use a net.",1374105600,,401,4.050632911392405
8101030,3,B000CR7U9A,"I have other videos of Kelly Galloup streamer fishing on the Madison River.  None of those areas were in the video so Galloup withheld vital information. I was hoping for more, disappointing.",1355788800,,191,4.96875
8101031,5,B000CR7U9A,Kelly has produced an excellent DVD. My father gave me this DVD for Christmas as he knows I love to fish the Madison and I learned a ton. Kelly breaks the river down by sections and does an excellent job giving sound advice that will be helpful to someone new to the Madison or someone returning for the 20th time.,1294531200,,314,4.25
