7726153,5,B01DY8NDBM,"Great movie and I have all the Star Trek DVDs, including movies as well as the TV series.  Regarding the TV series, I highly recommended the remastered seriest.",1468195200,,160,4.714285714285714
7726154,5,B01DY8NDBM,Looks great in 4K HDR. One of my favorite Star Trek films.,1467072000,3,58,3.9166666666666665
7726155,4,B01DY8NDBM,"The 4 stars is for the movie. No doubt the movies is fabulous and I respect everyones opinion justifying this price. That said, I read the reviews and comments for this 4K release and here is my 2 cents. The claim that this is new technology I believe is flawed. These and many, many other movies were already filmed in 4K (or higher) years ago. The first movie filmed in ultra hi def, all digital was Episode 1 of Star Wars, again, years ago. the following is absolutely true:  One of the first released official movie on VHS one could actually purchase and take home was Fox's ""Alien"", retailed for $100!. Fast forward to the next new technology, laser disc. ""Alien"" and ""Die Hard"", std editions were $50, special extended editions of both ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", again, from Fox was $100 each, (EACH). I know this to be true, because back then I was stupid, had the molten wallet and wanted it, plain and simple and spent the money and made the purchases as described. I remember doing it very clearly. Fast forward to today. These 4K movies are priced as such because studios know very well we will pay the price. I ask myself, how many times will I repurchase a movie, beginning with VHS to laser, to DVD to Blu-ray, to 3D to 4K. Remember, half of the fantastic (in its day) formats mentioned are now defunct as I predict soon will be 4K, this because I own a 3D, upscaling player and a SUHD 65"" TV and see no reason to repurchase any new hardware or software because I am almost there now. I have already learned a hard expensive lesson.  Guilty as charged. Remember the first few rounds of 4K releases were ""B and C"" grade features?
$47 for this and other titles is preposterous and does NOT mandate this surcharge to bring it to market. It is this expensive only because history has proven we will, like moths to a flame, happily pay the price. We only come here and complainer because it makes us feel good. It makes no difference to complain because if it did, this rip off practice would have corrected itself years ago, yet here we still are. Just wanted to share some real history, no crying over spilled milk or sour grapes for me, because occasionally I still do it. I hope this helps all of us understand marketing practices and know its not a financial hardship or some high cost futuristic technology for the studio to bring this to market. That is NOT the case.",1466467200,8,2378,4.451834862385321
7726156,1,B01DY8NDBM,$50 is outrageous. $30 is the going rate for 4K movies.,1466121600,,55,4.090909090909091
7726157,5,B01DY8NDBM,"The movie itself is fabulous - the 4K presentation is stunning and the Atmos soundtrack is top notch.  This movie has been in my top 10 favorites since it hit the theaters, and this release solidifies that.",1466035200,9,206,4.5675675675675675
7726158,5,B01DY8NDBM,"The 4K are getting great reviews. Amazon matches preorder prices and Best Buy has them both for 29.99, so that's what I'm expecting to actually pay. The second movie was 29.99 here at one point because I preordered it when it came up, and that's my lowest price charge.",1465776000,3,269,4.510204081632653
7726159,3,B01DY8NDBM,Really? Almost $50. DVD and Blu-ray were not this expensive when they first hit the market. And Fox only has a small premium over standard Blu-ray for Ultra HD 4K.,1463788800,14,163,4.466666666666667
7726160,5,B01DY8NDBM,"Great movie, will look even better in 4k/hdr. It's $50 because it's brand new technology and it takes money to produce it. I'm sure the people complaining haven't bought one of the two players on the market that will play this. Those are 4-500 each and are available on amazon.",1461542400,11,277,4.56

7726174,2,B01DY8NDBM,"This is not 4K, it looks almost exactly as a bluray movie. I did not see any difference with my bluray MADMAX. I bought Planet Earth in 4K and it is 4K. This movie is not. I played with every feature on my Tv and my 4K player but did not manage to get a 4K picture. 4K movies in Amazon video and Netflix look wayyyy better. I bought several movies in 4K and none of them is even closer to 4K.",1514764800,,392,3.792682926829268
7726175,5,B01DY8NDBM,Great movie! Lots of adventure and humor!,1513814400,,41,5.0
7726176,5,B01DY8NDBM,"This is an incredible movie on its own and the added HDR effects are truly spectacular even on a low end HDR panel. Watching this on my 70"" Vizio E series was quite the experence. Although this is clearly a ""fake"" 4k movie as most of the scenes appeared to be upscaled 1080 quality. However this is fine with me as true 4k makes CGI look like garbage which would ruin this movie. It is the HDR effects that really shine on this formate. The HDR lense flare really is quite gorgious and the panning space scenes look fantastic. This movie benafits hugely from the increased brightness range however the increased color accuracy did not appear to have much effect. Colors looked realistic as you'd expect from a bluray, so not much change there. Mainly the massive brightness range from dark to bright scnes is where the benefits of the 4k version are aparent, atleast on my low end HDR TV.",1513209600,5,888,4.521739130434782

7726179,1,B01DY8NDBM,Way too many lens flares....HUGE annoyance...and gave me a headache in 4k. Do a search on  'lens flare star trek'. Bought 2 not buying the 3rd one..(Star Treks by Abrams)...find other 4k movies to enjoy.,1512172800,,203,4.8
7726180,3,B01DY8NDBM,"I haven't played the movie yet but the 4k disc itself appears fine.
The case on the other hand is another story. It is cracked on both top and bottom. As shown in the picture this leads to the flip tray inside not being able to attach to the case and just flood around.",1512000000,,269,4.0
7726181,5,B01DY8NDBM,"The HDR definitely makes the bright lights and lens flares pop. Other than that, the 4k really doesnt seem that different than the blu-ray.",1511827200,,139,4.833333333333333
7726182,3,B01DY8NDBM,Disappointing 4K and HDR quality.  Not much better than the 1080P Blu Ray.  It is actually an upscale from 2K.,1511308800,,110,4.45

7726197,1,B01DY8NDBM,"First let me say, I loved the movie.  The one star isn't about the movie.  It's about the digital HD part.

This was my first 4k movie purchase.  When I entered the UltraViolet code, it only let me have the regular HD movie.  Not the UHD version I was expecting or paid for.
I contacted customer support....Flixster Video@uvsupport@warnerbros.com.  It ended up being a bunch-ado about nothing.  I gave them my UV code and UPC number.  They were aware of a problem with this title, but did nothing about it.  This is not an Amazon issue, it's Flixter.  But I'm still out the extra cash I paid out for the 4K version.",1502668800,,615,4.45945945945946

7726202,2,B01DY8NDBM,"Well like others I AM NOT rating the movie but the 4K DVD. First I am evaluating this using a SONY 1100 projector ($21k) with a 8 ft screen and 8ft away from it. Firstly The amount of what I can only describe as Noise looking like film noise but more pronounced was almost distracting at some points

I purchased this DVD looking for two improvement from 1080 principally color rendering and detail,  As to color rendering and detail I can not believe how bad this looked,

Color rendering was about the same as a 1080 HD although color rendering somewhat subjective but there was  no ""pop"" that is for sure.

 As for detail I did not see any improvement over 1080. Now it looked ""okay"" but not 4K, which should have a least 2 times if not 4 times the resolution,... Male actors facial hair or stubble was soft and female hair was almost flat, As most people know hair is the best test for detail, resolution or the lack of it, I even tried maximize the projector detail and that did not help just made, it looks just ugly.

As I final test I had a 1080 version of this movie and I could NOT see any make-able difference .

A second point as others have voices on the first run the DVD ran okay BUT the second time it began  to stutter about 2/3 onto the movie.

As a I 40year broadcast engineer so I am trained to ""see video quality"" and I was very disappointed  this was not a step up at ALL from 1080. at least on this DVD! Adding this I just watched 2001 and it looked SO MUCH BETTER I am degrading the stars after seeing a GREAT movie with great video and it came from 1960's vs over 50 years newer. vs 2001 did not have the horrible film grain/noise this did. .",1499558400,3,1667,4.161993769470405

7726204,3,B01DY8NDBM,I'd pass on this for 4k UHD discs. Into Darkness looks much better. Lot's of grain in the transfer. It's an okay movie overall but I was disappointed with the 4k transfer.,1498608000,2,171,4.375

Let me put it this way: we are HUGE Star Trek fans, we went to see this particular film in the theatres THREE TIMES it was so damn good. Yet, when we watched it on our 4K tv for the first time, we noticed the smallest of details that we hadn't noticed at any point when we saw it in the theatre!!!

7726236,2,B01DY8NDBM,"Honestly, pretty darn disappointing. They really need to work on 4K mastering and transfer because a lot of grain was noticeable - when I should've been getting more pixels, instead all I got was graininess. I was expecting to be wowed, but it looked no better than the BluRay version. Heck, it looked like someone just directly transfered the 1080p version to the UltraHD disc and called it a day. (EDIT: As it turns out, the movie was shot on 35mm but then mastered in 2K, and they simply upscaled it for this release. No wonder it looks grainy and bad!)

My setup is a 75"" Sony X940D and an Xbox One S, everything verified to be playing in 4K with HDR (including the temporary HDR fix affecting Sony/Xbox setups).",1475020800,7,716,4.507692307692308

7726249,4,B01DY8NDBM,"Awesome quality on 4K Blu-Ray. The film looks a little dated in this release and in my opinion is overshadowed by the sequel Into Darkness (outstanding quality), but a solid addition to a 4K Blu-Ray collection.

Not to mention its just an all around fun and action packed movie - but that's just my personal opinion.",1468886400,,316,4.642857142857143

Frankly, you could care less about if I liked the movie or not, at least I hope that is the case. What I am rating here is the QUALITY of the movie in 4K. You must have a 4K Blu-Ray player to play the 4K version of this movie, which is why I paid the extra cash for the disc. (Someday, I'm sure they will all drop in price when something else takes the place of 4K, at least I hope so!) do not be confused, my player does upscale non-4K discs to ""near"" 4K quality, but it also plays 4K discs. If you have a regular Blu-Ray player, it will not play this disc, so save yourself the cash and buy a Blu-Ray version. Anyway, I digress. The 4K quality of this movie played on my Samsung UBD-K8500 Ultra HD player is phenomenal. I own a Samsung Ulta HD TV model KS8000 TV, and the resolution is spectacular. You can see even the minutest fragment of debris in scenes of intergalactic battles, down to the strands of hair on the character's heads. It is as if you are living the scene, not merely watching it passively. The experience is well worth the money you will pay for the 4K version of his film. In my opinion, it beat the resolution that I saw it in at my local theater, and to be honest, I doubt my local theater has 4K resolution, but my experience has been that theaters make up for picture quality by boosting the sound extremely loudly instead in order to try to make you immerse yourself in the action. I can honestly say that this 4K movie played in its highest definition will immerse you without a doubt! Happy viewing!",1468713600,81,1993,5.173374613003096
8757279,5,B01DY8NDBM,"The 3 disc 4K Ultra HD + Blu-Ray + Digital HD, arrived on time and undamaged. Picture, sound and features playback is even better in this new viewing format, which brings this movie to true life, especially with the sound in stunning 7.1 Dolby Atmos. This purchase through amazon.com was worth paying for, especially the price and availability on amazon.com. One note is that the oversized jiffy bag it arrived in was both unecessary and  wasteful. So any other 4K Ultra HD/HDR + Dolby Atmos Blu-Ray movies, which I order from you, could you re-package them into a much smaller reinforced bubble wrapped jiffy bag that is slightly bigger than the 4K Ultra HD/HDR movie in its 4K HD Black jewel case. Movie in this new viewing format and soundtrack format was superb. 10 out of 10",1533081600,,779,4.686131386861314
8757280,1,B01DY8NDBM,"I had ordered this 4k movie 5 months ago and finally got around to watching it this past weekend and the movie would not play. It came with a 4k version, a regular blu-ray version and a special features disc. The blu-ray disc and the special features disc both played fine but the 4k would not play and my 4k Bluray player did not even recognize the disc after trying repeatedly. All other 4k movies I have tried to play in this machine played fine with no problems at all. I also purchased several other 4k movies at the same time which all played fine so I guess this disc was just defective. It's just that I found out way after the point to where I could have returned it to Amazon and now am out the price of the movie.",1531267200,,724,4.141843971631205
