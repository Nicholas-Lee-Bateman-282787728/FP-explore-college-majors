Once again Tokyo is under threat of demonic attack, and once again the powers that be are shunting the girls of the Flower Division off to the side in favor of some other method of defense with predictably disastrous results.  With treachery at the top, confusion and personality clashes at the bottom, can our girls first expose and then defeat the evil forces in play against them?

The answer is obvious, but getting there is the struggle, and explaining it all to non-gamers proved beyond the creators' abilities.  Too bad, because the animation, the music, and even the writing beyond the material left out was the best yet.

8599683,5,B00E00GC3A,Fantastic Film for lovers of Sakura Wars/game. I was in awe of the animation and the story. The japanese hit a home run with this movie. The voice cast for both japanese/english is stellar. The comradery of the girls/well thought out villians/and amazing animation makes this movie worth being in your collection. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have :) buy it!,1398124800,4,362,4.584615384615384
