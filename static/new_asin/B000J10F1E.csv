I rented this DVD at first to see what it is like. Well...I loved it!!!For the balanced quality of content which  is very bright,fun,joyfull  and professional at the same time. It is an actual ballet class in a fun but yet in real version.
I purchased it as a present for my niece who wants to be a ballerina but doesn`t have a chance to join the studio yet.
Besides all of the above DVD has 3 trailers that are fun to watch: ballet,hip-hop and jazz.",1236556800,4,488,4.293478260869565
2664775,3,B000J10F1E,"This is an ok video.  It's not the best for teaching ballet.  It's a little bit boring, I think.  My daughter was really excited about this at first, but only has done it two or three times.",1224720000,3,190,4.081081081081081
2664776,4,B000J10F1E,"This DVD is a good introduction for kids who are very keen to learn ballet.  It is presented in the format of a class, taught by Michelle Lundberg.  Kids are introduced to 1st through to 5th positions, Plies, Tondus, Degajes, Rondejambs, Passes, Piques, Pas De Bourres, Balances, and jumps.  I think that this DVD would best suit children 4 and up because the class format requires attention and obviously the moves are quite involved.  I bought this DVD for my two year old because she is mad on ballet and thought she could dance along but the slow pace of the class does not catch her attention.  The DVD is 38 minutes long.",1178928000,50,627,4.513274336283186

2664828,3,B000J10F1E,"Good video, but more for older kids.  My toddler gets bored quickly watching this, there's not enough Funtime dancing around, it's mostly standing still doing arm raises and footwork.  I think she will love this when she's 5-6 and has more attention span...",1452038400,,257,4.953488372093023
2664829,4,B000J10F1E,More training style and less fun for toddlers. My two year old daughter loves dancing but she does not have enough patience for this slow pace. She likes more exciting music and dance! It might work better for older girls.,1447113600,,222,4.575
2664830,5,B000J10F1E,"My 3 year old loves this video, she will try and follow it over and over again.  My 18 month old is even inspired and also tries to follow along.  If your kids love ballet this is a great starting point.",1445126400,,203,3.926829268292683

2664883,4,B000J10F1E,My 5 year old granddaughter loved this and had to put it on right away. She could follow the instructions pretty well and got better and better with each watching. The only reason for the 4 rating was that it did not show third position. I don't know what the reason for that was.,1419638400,,280,4.203703703703703

2664885,5,B000J10F1E,"My oldest daughter (6yr)has been in preballet for a 1yr 8 months, and my youngest (4yr) for 8 months. Their last insturctor was very good but she moved and was replaced but a fairly incompotent lady. I decided to save my $250 this session and get my daughters this DVD, so I feel really good about my purchase. They are starting to remember the names of the positions which is the first time they have attempted that. They are also excited about learning possitions they did not learn in preballet classes. I feel that this DVD will get my oldest daughter to the level she needs to be at to get accepted into a good ballet school, which requires testing for 6 year olds. The best part is they now have ballet 5 days a week, and they/I have more control over their progress which is inspiring my oldest daughter to try harder. She wants to make up her own ballet preformance now.",1416787200,,878,4.392638036809816

2664928,4,B000J10F1E,This is a good tape and it does keep things on a beginning level by going slow. The only thing that bothered me was that some of the moves are a little complicated for 3-5 year olds which is the main group we concentrate on. I would recommend the tape to brush up on your ballet terms if you are rusty!,1401667200,,302,3.9672131147540983
2664929,5,B000J10F1E,"My four year old, who is delayed in development, loves this video. It really helps her with her motor skills and gets her moving. I would recommend this to friends that have children with development or non development issues.",1395878400,,226,4.82051282051282

2664968,3,B000J10F1E,I have 2 3 year old girls that like it in the beginning because it was ballet but very slow and not to entertaining. My girls probable watch and followed for about 3mins and then went off doing other stuff. I would not advise this to any children just learning to do ballet or younger than 5 because its is not made fun to learn at all. I understand that ballet is elegant but I was not expecting it to be so boring for the young ones.,1388016000,2,435,4.011494252873563
2664969,3,B000J10F1E,Pretty boring for my little 4 year old. No music to make you want to move and just plain showing you the steps really. Great for a young dancer who wants to practice her positions I suppose.,1383696000,,190,4.162162162162162
2664970,5,B000J10F1E,It's a little difficult for my 4 year old but she will grow into it. It's very informative and a great way to incorporate physical fitness into my child's day.,1380672000,,159,4.333333333333333
2664971,5,B000J10F1E,My 3 your old grandniece loves this dvd.  Easy to follow along and keeps her interest.  She played it 5 times the first day and even got dad to join in.  Awesome Video!!,1379116800,,169,4.0606060606060606
2664972,1,B000J10F1E,"I was very disappointed with this video.

1) It is not fun.  The dance teacher is very serious and it isn't done in a fun way.  Very mechanical.  She says things like ""remember to keep your tummy in, shoulders back, chin up and smile"".  To my 5 year old daughter, that might be accurate instructions for ballet, but it doesn't make it fun at all.  My daughter loves other instructional ballet dance DVD's, but this one seemed very boring. (minus 3 stars)
2) Tinkerbell is not in this DVD at all.  I don't know why they call it Tinkerbell's dance DVD if Tinkerbell the character is not involved what-so-ever! (minus 1 star)
3) The DVD got an error message in both of my DVD players, so the only way to watch it was on a computer with a DVD drive.

Overall, very disappointed, especially because they don't make the DVD fun at all.",1378166400,4,829,4.372549019607843

2664975,2,B000J10F1E,"While the teaching in this seems quite good, and the girls are cute, it fall a little flat. My daughter is in beginner ballet classes and they have so much fun warming up and stretching, I guess I thought this would be like that and it isn't. The instructor is lovely and covers all the basics, but overall there really isn't enough to entice a young/beginning performer.",1376265600,,371,4.552238805970149
2664976,2,B000J10F1E,very disappointed in this video. there is nothing exciting or interesting to keep the child interested. would definitely not buy this video.,1369785600,,140,5.409090909090909
2664977,3,B000J10F1E,"This was a present for my three year old.  It doesn't catch her attention yet, but I'm sure it will in time.  The technique is shows is vital for ballet though.",1368057600,,160,4.129032258064516
2664988,1,B000J10F1E,"I bought this for my 4-yr old niece. I took ballet for years and thought this would be a cute way to peak her interest. I watched the video first and decided not to give it to her. It moves fast (which is good for kids, I guess), but the warm up is substantially lacking. Proper technique is also not emphasized at all. I decided not to give it to my niece because I feel like if she used this video, when she starts taking class in a studio, my niece would have to unlearn everything from this video and re-learn it the correct way.",1366675200,13,533,4.085714285714285
2664989,5,B000J10F1E,Well made with clear instruction. Probably best for child 3 or over as it is a little tricky for my 2yo.,1364860800,,104,4.0
2664990,4,B000J10F1E,"It is ok DVD. No problems with it, but it is not that great. I watch it with my daughter and it was a little boring (for me and for my 4 years old). It feels like something is missing.",1361750400,,184,3.625
2664991,4,B000J10F1E,"I thought there would be more fun to this and it seemed really short and sort of dull, but my 4 year old practiced the stretches and all regardless. Wish there was more in it to learn or at least more real time practice or something to view all put together, a nice routine to rewind and replay to practice.",1361491200,,307,4.133333333333334

2664995,4,B000J10F1E,"My 6 year old grandaughter likes the video.  But she does not seem to want to use it as often as I thought she would, in fact, has lost interest.  I think she would like to feel she is ""interacting"" with the video more.  --We expected it to arrive with a wall poster showing the ballet positions.  I think that would have increased my grandaughter's continued interest.  It was disappointing that it was incomplete.",1358726400,,415,4.554054054054054
2664996,4,B000J10F1E,My 4 year old  granddaughter loves this video. It is easy to follow and also gives her and grandma a good workout.. We live far out in the country and dance lessons haven't been an option so far for my granddaughter so this keeps her updated on terms and information if lessons ever become an option.  In my opinion she's got some real talent not to mention her drive to learn and she uses the Tinkerbell Dance video over and over again.  ( I also got her the out fit and shoes to go with it too she's adorable),1358553600,,511,4.141414141414141

She lost interest before they were threw the second step and had to WAKE my mom and I up!  So for true steps it is good, but it is not upbeat or lively... I can not belive my mom and I both feel asleep.",1331164800,2,331,3.7971014492753623

2665024,4,B000J10F1E,"We received just what we expected with this video. I think it would nicely compliment a regular ballet class, for home practice. It moves too quick for our six year old who is very interested, but has not received previous ballet instruction.

The instrctor is fantastic, she's clear in her instructions, and the 3 little girls following her are very cute and realistic. You can see that their form isn't 100% which made my daughter feel so encouraged. overall, a great DVD, totally recommended.",1319328000,2,371,4.636363636363637

2665060,3,B000J10F1E,"What's wrong with 3rd position?  It's not taught here, which I think is odd.  5th position is so much harder, and that's taught, when 3rd isn't.

Otherwise, my 6 year old really likes the video.  I was hoping she would do it independantly, but she doesn't.  I think a formal class would be better.",1299715200,7,297,4.425925925925926
2665061,3,B000J10F1E,I bought this for my four year old daughter and thought they went really fast in the program.  My daughter has even told me that she doesn't want to watch it anymore because it goes so fast.  I think this would be a great DVD if they slowed it down.  If your child learns fast and you also have some background in Ballet it may work for you.,1296172800,7,341,3.985294117647059
2665062,5,B000J10F1E,"I bought this for my 5 year old grand-daughter.  With in a week she had the moves down and was dancing around the house.

2665064,4,B000J10F1E,I purchased this DVD for my younger sister as a birthday present. I watched it with her as she tried her best to follow the instructor's directions. So far she has used it four times this month. I would recommend this item for children over the age of 8.,1294704000,,254,4.204081632653061

This was a birthday gift for my niece who wants to learn how to dance ballet and to have her own tutu. Now her gift is pointless and disappoiting. I will never buy from this place again.",1291420800,3,315,3.8615384615384616
2665066,3,B000J10F1E,"I would have given this 4 stars because I *personally* thought it was a good DVD for the money and it included exactly what I was looking for. However, I had to give it a 3 because my daughter would only watch it once.

I should mention that she just turned 7 and does sometimes tire of activities quickly--within about a week. However, she's been ballet crazy for years, and tends to do better with ""aged down"" activities anyway. So I thought this would be a perfect introduction, since our local ballet school's class times don't fit our schedule.

The quality of the video is good and the instruction seems appropriate for a rank beginner. A child who has had more than a few ballet lessons might find it boring, though. It's VERY basic. My daughter went through the entire DVD class dutifully and I thought she was enjoying it. Afterward she complained of soreness from the workout and we talked about ballerinas working hard and needing to be strong to dance as they do.

That was that. The DVD never came out again, and my daughter refused when I offered it. Turns out that she felt there was too much rote instruction of ""this arm here, bend there"" positioning and not enough of the ""fun"" part of dancing she was expecting. Maybe her expectations were too high for beginner ballet, but there WAS a lot of perfunctory stuff so I could see her point. I'm going to look for a DVD that offers more actual dance choreography to see if that rekindles her interest. In any case, I thought I'd post our experience here for anyone whose child is at a similar age/interest level.",1289520000,46,1576,4.52280701754386

2665079,5,B000J10F1E,For a little girl interested in ballet this video is awesome. It really works as a real class. It may seem short but for the age group it is just right. My 4-year-old loves practicing with it and has even learned to pause and play it again when she needs a break 'cause it gives her a real work-out!

They have not been terribly impressed, so I am basing this review on their reaction. They are 3 and 5. They have yet to make it through the end without getting bored. Sorry, it just isn't that exciting for them!",1268784000,3,346,4.257575757575758

2665083,4,B000J10F1E,"My daughter is 6 and loves this DVD. It is well put together and great for aspiring ballerinas. Some parts move just a little quickly for young kids and now and then the camera angle goes from the front to the back which is something they need to do away with if they create an updated video at some point - if a child is mirroring the dancer and the angle changes suddenly, it can be confusing. But once my daughter had used the DVD a few times, she was able to catch right on to the moves. The teacher is very likable and does well connecting with her audience. I would recommend this DVD for anyone with a youngster who is developing an interest in ballet! Any youngster who wants to ""be a ballerina someday"" will want to practice every day, and this is a great way for them to get this practice. There is also a section on the DVD showing the lives of other ballerinas at all different levels. I think I might have enjoyed this part more than my daughter - LOL!",1266019200,33,965,4.193548387096774

What a disappointment; this little girl needs music with her instructions.

Michele delivers a very enjoyable yet disciplined enough beginner's ballet class.
Her speech is fun and clear.
She has a positive attitude and her movements are easy to follow yet very professional.
I enjoyed her instruction from an adult stand-point.
