8243617,5,B00122M2F6,"I just purchased this DVD (in NSTC format) here at Amazon.  Unlike PAL, the NSTC format is compatible with American market DVD players.

I agree with the first reviewer's comments regarding the audio quality of this new re-release from SONY Classics.  This particular performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto is all the more enjoyable thanks to the ""re-recording"" techniques used.  The orchestra has a richer, fuller and certainly more natural sound.  This is very evident during the various featured instrument parts such as the lead oboe.

After doing a comparison to the original DVD (1984) this new DVD (2007) presents the ""large"" full orchestra passages with far more detail and range.  It no longer has a ""compressed"" sound; the listener can now clearly hear the individual instrument sections.  Even better, Mutter's solo parts are more forward and detailed.  In my comparing the two editions, I found the entire sound stage to be broader and better realized.  This was the case for both audio formats available on the DVD, which is much improved using either 2.1 PCM Stereo and 5.1 Dolby Surround modes.  Overall, I found this recording now comes very close to the audio quality of my Deutsche Grammophon CD with Mutter, Masur and the New York Phil that was recorded in 2002.

In comparing the DVD video, I felt the new DVD's picture quality overall is more vibrant but the digital ""tweaking"" has also reduced detail.

As for the DVD itself, it comes in an attractive thinner cardboard case rather than the typical plastic DVD snap case and the DVD's menu access is easier and quicker.  Included is a booklet that has excellent content on the composer, the work, the musicians and the audio techniques employed to realize this ""new"" recording - kudos to all those involved in the production.  Recommended.",1325894400,,1815,4.983388704318937
8243618,1,B00122M2F6,"This DVD will not play on any U.S. DVD player. I have tried three different DVD players and I get the same message: ""wrong zone, can not be played"".
Out of desparation, I found a program that I could download onto my home computer which would let me watch it on my home PC. Buyer Beware.",1325808000,,287,4.142857142857143
8243619,5,B00122M2F6,"Twenty years ago I bought the Laserdisc of this performance, and was quite happy with it.  Ten years ago I got the DVD and was less thrilled.  Last year I got this European enhanced DVD, and have finally gotten around to doing an A/B comparison (first I had to get a PAL-compatible player).  I cannot speak for the rest of the Karajan Sony archive, but this Beethoven Violin Concerto comes across much better now.  Behold: there now is hall ambience, thanks to the efforts of the remastering engineers to play back the recording in the hall itself for re-recording.  The original recording was early digital and failed to capture the decay of the sound signal as it reverberated through the hall.  However, there is more to this than that.  The violinist is much better balanced over against the orchestra now, and sounds like quite an exceptional musical interpreter.  I still like the Laserdisc sound, but the new DVD is a real remix and brings us even closer to what was really happening.",1300752000,3,991,4.72093023255814
