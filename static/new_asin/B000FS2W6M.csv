2582875,5,B000FS2W6M,"This was a good idea because some of the best and funniest episodes were during the Halloween season. This is my personal favorite episode is when Dan & Roseanne Connor decide to battle who is or will be ""The Master"" of fright that is. The first scary episode is the BEST and the Conners host a haunted house for everyone. Jackie pulls off the funniest costume as the head on a platter(she is great the whole season) but in the end Roseanne pulls the alltime scariest move on Dan when she announces her mom the dreaded Beverly will be staying 3 weeks giving Dan a near stroke. He eventually bows to the Fair Maiden of Fright. Of course she was just teasing",1154390400,,656,4.385245901639344
2582876,5,B000FS2W6M,"By far, the Halloween episodes of Roseanne were the best from the series.  There will be seven episodes included on this disc from seasons 2-8 from the nine season show.

Among the episodes, Roseanne is mistaken for a man - since she is wearing a lumberjack costume, and goes with it.  Roseanne sends everyone to a Halloween party while she sits home and moaps, resulting in the Ghosts of Halloween Past / Present / and Future visiting her.  Roseanne gets her husband Dan to pull a Halloween stunt on Nancy (played by Sandra Bernhard).  Leon invites a bunch of his friends to a Halloween party to the ""Lunch Box"", who seem to know Jackie's husband Fred well, raising the question if he's gay or not.

Having watched this show when it was new, and never want to tune into the reruns, I definally won't be being buying this show season by season (I think four seasons are available to buy now).  But, I will be buying this best-of set.

The end of these Halloween episodes were the best when you got to see a series of carved pumpkins on the Connor family porch.",1149811200,14,1060,4.455958549222798

2582879,5,B000FS2W6M,"I like to read the Trivia section before each show, and in this episode it mentions a crew member walking through the kitchen as Roseanne and Jackie walk out of the kitchen; however, upon closer observation, it is actually Jackie's reflection bouncing off the double oven.  Her red sweater can be clearly seen.  I'm not going to deduct stars for that, though, because the episode still made me laugh hysterically.",1522972800,2,413,4.885714285714286
2582880,5,B000FS2W6M,"Roseanne is such a unique, amazing show. I'd categorize it as one of the greatest sitcoms of all-time. I grew up in Africa and loved watching TV. The TV provider showed programs from around the world so I grew up on amazing shows from the USA, UK, Africa and more. I'm not sure Roseanne was shown (syndicated), but maybe it was and I just missed it. But I sure caught up this past month and LOVED it to death all to catch up with the reboot which aired last week.

She has raised some pretty awful kids as well... they are not bad as in druggy bad... yet... but they are not good people and they don't make good decisions. The only character I like out of this whole show is Jackie.... she really does hold everything together with Roseanne's family. The only reason I watched this show is because the whole thing was on Amazon Prime and during my shift at work it was something to watch and it's  ok to watch when nothing else is on. There is going to be a Roseanne Reboot scheduled to come out in 2018... I'm interested to know how they are going to bring back Dan since he died from the heart attack. Another thing... I'm so glad that I looked up the show before I started the 9th season because I knew something was off from how stupid the episodes were.",1512950400,3,880,4.432098765432099

2582922,5,B000FS2W6M,"the best episodes of Rosanne were always the Halloween ones. There is even an episode where an outtake was purposely left in. First seasons seem to be missing the first minute or two of the episodes. Those episodes start at the normal ""dinner table"" shot, but I believe those episodes started before the episode cut to the dinner table opening scene.  Included is the rare 9th season Halloween episode, and an episode that also has Roseanne commenting on it.. The first season did not have a Halloween episode.",1475971200,,510,4.795454545454546

I'm glad they came out with this collection. It makes it easier to watch the Halloween episodes during the season with out having to put in the individual disc for each season. I wish other shows would do this as well. Home Improvement Halloween episodes would be a great collection, as well as a Halloween collection of 90's TGIF shows would be Ideal.

2583039,5,B000FS2W6M,"This is a FANTASTIC deal for those who may have missed the previous Anchor Bay release ""Roseanne: Halloween Edition."" But ""Roseanne: Tricks and Treats"" is even better, because it's A LOT cheaper, and it includes the infamous 9th season Halloween ""Absolutely Fabulous"" crossover episode ""Satan, Darling.""

The ""Roseanne"" Halloween episodes are wonderful. They capture the spirit of the holiday unlike any other sitcom has been able to do. Plus, they're gleefully morbid, playfully macabre, and downright hilarious.

""Satan, Darling"" is a bizarre hybrid of Edina Monsoon and patsy Stone from the enormously popular British comedy series ""Absolutely fabulous"" and an uneven, sometimes painfully unfunny spoof of ""Rosemary's Baby."" It's a very strange episode, one that takes place in Manhattan, New York after the Conners have won the lottery. I am a HUGE ""AbFab"" fanatic, but even I don't particularly care for this episode. Yet for completion's sake, I'm glad that it's finally included with the other Halloween episodes, and I do watch it sometimes.

The best thing of all, however, is that the special feature from the previously released Anchor Bay disc (commentary from Roseanne on one of the episodes) is also included on this DVD, too.

All in all, you get an extra episode and some great, insightful commentary from Roseanne (what she says about George Clooney is particularly interesting) at a very, very cheap price --- not a bad deal. Very, very highly recommended!

PERFECT Halloween viewing.",1317686400,43,1502,5.2677824267782425

Or even if you do have the $, it's really nice to have all the Halloween shows on one disc. Roseanne's Halloween shows are by far the best Halloween sitcom shows I've seen.

And her Halloween episodes were often some of the most shining examples of comedy within the whole framework. I have often wondered why the Halloween episodes weren't collected in one DVD...and now they are. Any fan of the series should have this excellent collection, and trot it out each year, just like A WONDERFUL LIFE at Christmas.

offered a compilation DVD.  Roseanne was a comic genius when it came to her
show and it really shows in these Halloween episodes.  Roseanne's show made

It saved me a lot of money since I was considering buying a couple of seasons for the Halloween episodes. Apparently, they recognize that Roseanne made classic Halloween sitcom episodes and decided to put them on DVD for the fans. Now that's pretty considerate! How many sitcoms come out with a DVD full of just their Halloween episodes? Very, few if any! That goes to show you how great Roseanne's Halloween episodes were. I used to watch them every year off a VHS I taped when they all ran together in syndication. Needless to say, the repeat viewings made the picture a little grainy. Now I can watch all the episodes, complete on DVD all year round! No more waiting for Nick At Nite to replay them once a year either!

2583076,5,B000FS2W6M,"This DVD contains the Halloween special episodes of Roseanne from seasons 2 through 8. Oddly enough, the Halloween special episode from season 9, ""Satan, Darling"", is not included. Many people who hate season 9 of Roseanne - and there are a lot of you - will cheer at this news, but I, personally, am disappointed since that particular episode was officially as much a part of the Roseanne Halloween collection as any, and also because it is interesting to contrast the writing, acting, and overall atmosphere of season 9 with all of the others. I include a brief synopsis of all of the Halloween episodes included on this DVD below:

Season 2 (Boo) - The Conners are welcoming the neighborhood kids to their ""Tunnel of Terror"" as Roseanne and Dan decide to find out who can scare the other the most. First Dan pretends he cuts off his hand while repairing the garbage disposal. Roseanne thinks this is on the level and comes to his aid until she realizes it's a stunt and he is using fake blood. Later Dan hears Roseanne on the phone talking to Bev about her moving in with them. A horrified Dan nearly has a heart attack and Roseanne is declared the winner.

Season 3 (Trick or Treat) - DJ decides he wants to dress as a witch for Halloween this year, and this has Dan very upset as he believes it might mean DJ is having trouble with his own gender identity. You see, Dan believes only girls should dress as witches. Meanwhile, Roseanne decides to find out what it's like to be one of the guys by dressing up in Dan's clothes. She then goes to the Lobo and enjoys conversing with a group of men there on a variety of subjects. You even see Roseanne trying to make conversation with ""another"" man at the urinal. Unfortunately, the restroom scene has been cut from most (if not all) syndicated showings of this episode. We also get another look at Crystal's desperation for male companionship as she shows an interest in Roseanne ( alias Bob) after ""Bob"" pays her some well placed compliments.

Season 4 (Trick Me Up, Trick Me Down) - Dan and Roseanne scare the wits out of their next-door neighbor, the snobby Kathy Bowman, when they have her convinced that Roseanne has murdered Dan in a fit of homicidal rage. Roseanne then spends the rest of the episode expecting Kathy to retaliate for the prank that has been played on her. When she doesn't, Dan finally has to fake a retaliation at the end of the episode so that Roseanne will stop obsessing over this. Meanwhile, Jackie flirts with a stranger at the Lobo Lounge costume party who turns out to be her ex-boyfriend Booker (George Clooney) in a Moose costume. This is George Clooney's final appearance on Roseanne. Booker hadn't appeared on Roseanne since the season one finale, ""Let's Call It Quits"". There are some good gags in this episode, but it wasn't as good as the previous two Halloween specials. This is the only episode with video commentary.

Season 5 (Halloween IV) - Roseanne sends everyone to a party while she stays home, depressed over the absence of Becky. She is subsequently visited by the ghosts of Halloween past, present, and future. She has her normal smart-mouth retorts even to the ghosts though, comparing the ghost of Halloween present to a big piece of candy corn.

Season 6  (Halloween V) - Roseanne believes that Darlene and David are dating other people, and this is all part of a prank the two are playing on her in which Roseanne finally gets bested. To me, this was the best Halloween episode since the one during season three.

Season 7 (Skeleton in the Closet) - Dan and Jackie's husband, Fred, convince Roseanne that Fred is hiding his true sexual orientation when all of the guests at Leon's Halloween party at ""The Lunch Box"" seem to know Fred a little too well. There are also some hilarious scenes with Jackie speculating that her mother wears a wig and may be bald. This leads her to the conclusion that she may go bald as she ages too. Jackie then puts on the wig and begins doing an imitation of her mother, even getting the voice down pat: ""Oh Roseanne! Roseanne, a woman your size should not wear horizontal stripes, you should wear black! Or stay at home!"". For some reason, this particular episode isn't aired much in syndication, not even during the Roseanne Halloween episode marathons.

Season 8 (Halloween: The Final Chapter) - This episode begins with Halloween at the Connors. They have a seance around the table and Dan and David fool some trick or treaters. Then Roseanne and Jackie play with the ouija board. They ask when is Roseanne going to have her baby, and it spells out the word ""NOW"". The scene suddenly changes and Roseanne is in the hospital. Jerry Garcia appears from beyond the grave via a videotape with a message especially for Roseanne. Meanwhile the doctors and nurses are dancing around Roseanne's bedside as though they are accompanying vocalists of some type. In the end, we see that all of this strange stuff was Roseanne halucinating while she was having the baby. Roseanne and Dan's new son Jerry Garcia Connor is born, which is particularly strange since the show has been saying the baby is a girl for months. This is the second poorest of the Halloween episodes, the poorest being the one from season nine that is not included in the DVD. It gives a foreshadowing of what we see a lot more of the following year - the absurd and the bizarre replacing the great original comedy of the earlier years.

If you are a Roseanne fan, I highly recommend this DVD set. If you are not familiar with Roseanne, some of the unexplained subplots in the Halloween episodes may leave you somewhat confused.",1156550400,76,5629,4.632264529058117
