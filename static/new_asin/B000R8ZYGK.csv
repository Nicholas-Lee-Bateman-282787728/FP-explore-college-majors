2862099,4,B000R8ZYGK,"Barbara Lefay lives in California with her boyfriend. She does not really have much of a relationship with her father Henry Lefay, but when she hears that he died para sailing in Mexico she goes to New York to deal with his death and all of his wives.

On the plane she tells her boyfriend the last time she went back to deal with her father. Henry needed Barbara to help him deal with wife number 3 Veronica who was his business partner. While Barbara was there he wanted her to get to know wife number 6 Autumn and thrown into the mix is wife number 2 (and 4) Ophelia whom Henry was still sleeping with as well as Henry's finance who went to school with Barbara (whom she cant stand)

All six of his wives get together to bury Henry and mayhem ensues.

All in all a very good movie",1325635200,,783,4.172185430463577
2862100,2,B000R8ZYGK,"Tim Allen plays a quite jumpy older dude who is/was involved with 6 women. He does not really know who to marry next. When Tim Allen's character dies on vacation, his former, current and ""soon to be ex"" are coming together for his funeral.

The movie has an unexpected ending.

The movie is okay to watch, but it did not really make me laugh as usual. Nothing my dvd collection really needed, but I did not know the movie before I bought it.",1293321600,,441,4.301204819277109
2862101,3,B000R8ZYGK,"The last Tim Allen film that no one knew about actually fared well in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-on-the-Outside-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B003H2RKOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy on the Outside (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>], so I was hoping for a sleeper hit here as it did not make any of the promotional posters or ads. It became painfully obvious why as the credits rolled.

The story follows an estranged daughter (played by Elisha Cuthbert) as she returns to her high school hometown to deal with the reported death of her father, (filled by Allen for less than 1/3 of the film) the drama of his many ex-wives, a completely mis-written ex played by Chris Klein for two scenes, play the referee of a slapstick style dysfunction between all of the quibbling ladies, and then finally the magical reappearance of her dad. The performances are as expected for a light low-brow comedy but what really detracted from it was all of this talent only getting bit parts here and there. Paz Vega gets a few funny moments, Andie MacDowell had a few heartfelt lines, but the lion's share went to Cuthbert, who had to play the irritated daughter - and that appeared genuine because I think she didn't like the role. They edited the scenes with an X-Files style date and location text to try and add flavor by telling the story out of sequence, it fell short.

The Blu is decent quality throughout, but falters in several test scenes of contrast/darkness, and the sound is DTS but rarely gets utilized. They threw this BD out with absolutely no supplements, some corny artwork that didn't happen in the film, so this can only get a few stars for the level of Blu quality and the great cast (Elfman, S. Epatha Merkkerson, Eric Olsen, etc.). Maybe a renter.",1287100800,,1826,5.103678929765886
2862102,4,B000R8ZYGK,"Tim Allen plays Henry LeFay, a man who never met a woman he didn't marry. Henry is a ""Crazy Eddy"" type who lives in a small upstate NY town. He is on vacation in Mexico when word comes to his daughter Barbie, that he has died. Barbie, who looks like a Barbie doll, is our voice of reason during this film. The movie then goes into a flashback of Henry, married to a young girl named Autumn (same age as his daughter Barbie), is also engaged to woman who Barbie loathes from high school (3 years younger than his wife Autumn) while he is having an affair with his ex-wife. To be honest, she was wife number 2 and number 4. At one point his ex-wife is chasing Henry with a knife because during oral sex he had answered his cell phone to talk to his fiancee (while his wife was away).

At the funeral, his ex-wives have conflicting instructions, written by Henry as to his funeral arrangements. During the bickering, an African-American woman shows up at the funeral claiming she was really Henry's first wife and that their marriage was annulled after three months. Henry's elderly mom keeps mistaking her for the hired help. In one touching scene Barbie tries to bond with her grandmother by asking her to tell her something she never told her before. As it turns out, grandma was a woman for hire at Pearl Harbor during the war.

After the funeral (I will spare you the comic details of the funeral to prevent spoiling the film) the movie ties up loose ends in a heart warming fashion.

Normally I avoid things with cute title puns such as Joan of Arcadia, or Grey's Anatomy, but this one was good for a laugh. Adult themes, rear nudity, drops the f-bomb very infrequently.",1286409600,9,1673,4.46078431372549

2862104,5,B000R8ZYGK,"I had never even heard of this movie until I came across it while on Amazon looking to purchase some other DVD's.  I was kind of concerned about whether it would be a good movie, or not.  I was not disappointed at all. Tim Allen was great in this movie, just like any one of his other many movies.",1439769600,,297,4.016949152542373
2862105,5,B000R8ZYGK,"With so many fighting styles out there, it is refreshing to see someone distill down a few basic tools for many jobs. Simonet has done that with this DVD. In it, he uses what he calls CAPA, Conceptual Analysis, Practical Application, and teaches how a basic entry stance/technique can be used for a multitude of situations, and with enough practice, the results could be devastating and very effective. He also acknowledges that you need more than just the knowledge, but some strength and stamina training as well. If you are looking for an easy-to-understand and practical approach to defending yourself in most situations, this is it.",1438387200,,637,5.018867924528302

2862110,4,B000R8ZYGK,"This movie was very enjoyable and very funny in spots. As for Tim Allen supposedly
being the ""lead"" actor he does not have much of a role in the film. It is entertaining and
well-worth a watch. The acting is good. I would recommend this film which is different.",1418774400,4,261,4.346938775510204

2862117,3,B000R8ZYGK,"Not too great a story, rather dumb and with a plot that is easy to figure out.  Really somewhat stupid!",1371945600,,103,4.15
2862118,4,B000R8ZYGK,"This is a good video for anyone who has viewed any of Mr Simonet's other training videos and/or has had previous training in preferably Chinese or Indonesian Martial Arts.  The video was filmed during a training seminar given by Mr Simonet and does much to highlight training with the Wooden Dummy from Wing Chun for the first half of the presentation.
The second half shows techniques built from the ""entry technique"" shown on the wooden dummy.  This part is quite good and shows how to flow your techniques and develop a good method of training which will serve well is Self Defense.  This is not a video for Sport oriented Martial Artists and concentrates soley on the Combat Application of the system.  Mr Simonet uses some basic techniques from Wing Chun, Pentak Silat, Muy Thai and others; putting them together to form an excellent fighting system that can be adapted by anyone depending on age, gender, strength etc.
My only criticism would be that Mr Simonet explains that some techniques are meant to break collar bones and necks and I'm sure he could do that considering his size, years of training on these techniques and years of Martial Arts experience.  I would advise that breaking a bone is not always as easy as it seems and while a good fight ender, the targeting and skill in technique required is considerable.
Otherwise this is a great supplement to the Martial Artist's and Combative Enthusiast's Library.  I have another video by Mr Simonet, ""You're Already Dead"", which made it easier for me to follow the theory behind this video.  This stuff will work but you gotta practice.  It requires getting close to your opponent pursuing him with the objective of putting him down and out.  As a Hapkido practictioner, I really appreciated some of the finishing techniques shown in the second part of the video.
Worthwhile.  Enjoy.",1367107200,5,1849,4.841269841269841
2862119,4,B000R8ZYGK,"I knew Tim Allen would be funney but most of the laughs in this film come from the perfectly played
Nutzzoid charactures of the women in the cast.  Some even reminded me of women I actually know!
After much amusement and laughter I ended the movie thinking that had I been involved with such a
wacky bunch of women I would have never let anyone know I was still alive.  But its also a good moral
pointer that shows just how complicated a mans life (and death) can become if he does not restrain
himself and remain faithful to one woman.  This movie is FUNNY and not what you would expect it to be.
