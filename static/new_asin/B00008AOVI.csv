The other kids performance was funny, when they were wrestling in there room, i laughed my butt off. I loved this movie and i loved Jessica's performance! if your a Jessica Alba fan then go out and gt this!",1055894400,9,396,4.025316455696203
1834282,5,B00008AOVI,I saw this years ago when it was on Disney and I have to laugh at some of the dialog in this movie and some of the things that we used back in 1998/1999 when this movie was made.,1395619200,,178,3.58974358974359

1834284,5,B00008AOVI,"Growing up in the 90s and early 2Ks, I remember watching Disney movies like this all the time! This is a great disney classic from the early 2Ks. One of my favorite movies, I enjoy the nostalgia of watching these movies and the memories it brings back! The movie focuses around a group of teenagers who set out to save a Dad from a company using illegal testing and plans to use it on the Dad. Full of fun and comedy, this movie offers lessons in friendship, family, and loyalty. A great movie for all ages!",1356825600,,507,4.291666666666667
1834285,3,B00008AOVI,Seems like a pretty dumb movie to me but my younger brother and sister love this movie. They spent years laughing and quoting this movie.,1325116800,2,137,4.52
1834286,1,B00008AOVI,"If you type in Patrik Ian Polk's name on Amazon this film comes up. This is NOT Patrik Ian Polk's film of the same name which as of this date has not yet been released on DVD. Amazon should correct the listing, but in the meantime, be aware this is not director Polk's film. The one star is for the mistaken listing, not for this film which I have never seen.",1311811200,13,359,4.070422535211268
1834287,5,B00008AOVI,this movie was great for kids age 10 and under my older grandkids said it was ok.,1251849600,,81,3.823529411764706
1834288,5,B00008AOVI,"It took a long time to decide to buy this film despite being a long time Jessica Alba fan even she was not impressed with her work here. My daughter convinced me and thought it was a super film hence the rating. Miss Alba steals the show despite her accent which I think she should have avoided...but she was probably the most real actor in the show.

My children enjoyed the film and recommeneds.",1138665600,4,397,4.364864864864865

7981363,5,B00008AOVI,"I watched this movie for the first time when I was probably ten years old. Now, at age 23, it is still a movie I remember fondly. I don't know if I'd recommend it for someone in my age range now but I'd definitely recommended it for younger audiences who are looking for adventure, humor, and suspense. I think it was the perfect mixture.",1406937600,,338,4.296875
