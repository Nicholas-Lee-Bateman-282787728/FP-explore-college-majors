5713381,3,B00CBVWWUW,"First, there's an oil spill, then a monster pops up and destroys an oil rig.  Since the military didn't have anyone better suited for the mission, they send three color coded idiots instead (Jackie Moore, Treach, & David Chokachi) to investigate the matter.  Think low-grade Power Rangers without the youthful enthusiasm.  Bad boy Chokachi chases the monster onto a beach where both he and the monster wreck havoc on the local community.  ""Eat this!  Opps.""  Soon there are bodies everywhere.  Bad boy Chokachi pops out of his robot suit long enough to brag to his buddies that's he's the hero.  ""Yeah!""  While bodies are literally splayed at their feet, totally ignored.  Bad boy Chokachi is arrested for disobeying direct and indirect orders and tossed into a shed my dead grandmother could have broken out of (yet it takes Treach a hammer and an hour and six days to get the stupid doorknob off).  These 3 knucklehead superheroes are desperately deficient in so many uncountable ways.

Bargain basement, low-low-budget, crap by any name, there are movies that are so bad they're incredibly good.  This one is just plain awful.  Everyone involved is hopelessly inept.  The story is a watered down rip-off.  The dialog is repetitious and limited to macho jingoisms (apparently, something was ""toasty"" often and a lot).  The characters are so flat and uniformly dull that cardboard would have done a better job (the worst of the lot is Chokachi, who appears early on as slightly inebriated but up for the job.  Then for some strange reason he plays his character that way throughout, stoned and stupid).  I didn't expect much from the rest of the cast.  But I did feel terribly sad when I saw what they made poor Graham Greene do as Admiral Hadley (here is an actor once nominated for an Oscar, a Gemini Award winning actor, reduced to spouting dreadful dialog in a hand-me-down sci-fi flick).  Oh how the mighty have fallen.  There's desperate for work and just plain desperate.

Barely just okay, I suppose some people might think it's a hoot.",1403136000,10,2045,4.8468208092485545
5713382,2,B00CBVWWUW,"After following Asylum pictures for some years now their formula of micro-budget programs is getting tiresome. They make the old Roger Corman drive in quickys of the 50s look like "" A Picture""  classics.  Surely they are making enough profit to spend a little more money on SPFX shots by now. Their shot count is not minimalist.  It is just shamefully cheep.",1395619200,,358,4.741935483870968
5713383,1,B00CBVWWUW,"I was so hopeful about this movie. I bought it to watch before watching the new second one. I was so sorry I had wasted my money. It had a lot of potential, but it did not live up to it.",1395273600,2,186,3.5609756097560976
5713384,5,B00CBVWWUW,"The Asylum is a low, low budget, direct-to-video production house specializing in rip offs--or 'tie-ins', as they like to call 'em--of major studio films, chosen on the basis of said films' advance publicity material, and thus are available ahead of the real movies.  For detailed info on the company, see the Wikipedia article, and check out their website.
As for this particular rip o--er, tie in, let's start with the box synopsis:
""When giant monsters crawl out of the Atlantic Ocean and attack the Eastern Seaboard, the US Government is forced to trust experimental mech bots, piloted by inexperienced airmen. When the first defense fails, it's up to the three pilots to prove their worth by saving New York from the monsters.""
If this sounds familiar, well, the original, before threat of lawsuit title was Atlantic Rim.
And that's sufficient coverage I think, so I'll close out with a list of a few other 'tie ins' you might enjoy--or at least love hating.
---
Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies (actually quite good)
American Warships (originally American Battleship)
Battle of Los Angeles
Nazis at the Center of the Earth ('inspired' by Timo Vuorensola's Nazis-on-the-moon epic Iron Sky)
Terminators
Transmorphers
Transmorphers: Fall of Man (a prequel, starring--good grief!--Bruce Boxleitner)
---
The 'tie--aw, forget it!  The knock off I'd really like to see would be After Oblivion, but I suppose the time for that has passed--still, guess it wouldn't hurt to submit a spec script...
Anyway, see ya in the next review!",1385510400,,1523,5.137096774193548
5713385,4,B00CBVWWUW,"Sure, it's a ""Mockbuster"", but what the hell do you expect???? I love B-Movie Flicks. Some are good and some are bad. Coming from The Asylum Studios, honestly, it's one of the best flicks that they have. To me, this was more like a Power Rangers to me (minus the robots merging into one giant robot), but I really liked it. Any studio can do more when they are given a bigger budget. The challenge is to make a movie somewhat enjoyable, somewhat family friendly, but overall entertaining. To me, a good edition to have in your movie library.",1384387200,14,541,4.474747474747475
5713386,3,B00CBVWWUW,"For those of you who couldn't qualify for a loan to take your family to see ""Pacific Rim"" Asylum presents this mockbuster. A sea creature emerges from a bad plot point (100 million year gestation) to attack New Orleans. Three experimental ""Bots"" (100 ft CG robots) each manned by one person go after the creature.

The three bots are known as Red, Green, and Blue. Each one is filmed in the same room with a different colored light and person...except in one scene, what was supposed to be a blue light was red. Fire the best boy. The threesome is under the command of Admiral Hadley (Graham Greene) a rather salty old man who uses phrases such as ""bull butter"" and ""Jesus H. Christ."" His antagonist is a one eyed submarine Captain.

On the plus side, the ranking insignias stay the same throughout the film, a problem Asylum has had in the past. The soundtrack, which was excellent in ""Pacific Rim"" was clearly second tier in this film, including the swagger music for our hero threesome. Some of the CG effects were better than others, with flames being the worse. In one scene Red uses a laser which goes out of control and takes down a building. If you watch closely, the building starts to fall before the laser hits it. Appropriately Red says, ""oops"" perhaps a comment on Asylum's editors.

The film has also been called ""Atlantic Rim,"" ""5,000 Fathoms Deep,"" and ""From the Sea."" Might be worthy as a rental for the kids. Don't expect too much.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Talk involving a love triangle.",1374883200,8,1526,4.619926199261992
5713387,4,B00CBVWWUW,"When giant monsters crawl out of the Atlantic Ocean and attack the Eastern Seaboard, the US Government is trust three military personnel to control A.I. Robots(dubbed The Armada Program) to defend the country.

Originally titled Atlantic Rim, this film produced by The Asylum & directed by Jared Cohn is The Asylum's version of the Warner Bros. Pictures/Legendary Pictures film Pacific Rim. Attack From Beneath is one of The Asylum's better films as of late, in my honest opinion. Looks to me that, even though they're still doing their versions of blockbuster summer films that are coming out from other companies, they're getting wise and putting alot more effort & money into their films. I believe if they continue this trend that the masses will start taking their films alot more seriously instead of cheap knock-offs of the actual films. So far, in their library, they've had several films reviewed as actually being better than the films they were doing their versions of(War of the Worlds, Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, Hansel & Gretel, & American Warships, to name a few). Jared Cohn, apparently, knows what it takes to make a good Kaiju film.

My two biggest gripes with the movie is the fact that it moves along at a brisk pace and cuts to the chase as quickly as possible(By the time you actually invest your time with the characters that control the mechs; the movie is, literally, done and over with). & that it doesn't pursue certain plot elements a little farther(like the love triangle between the three mech pilots).

Other than that, Attack From Beneath is worthy of viewing and of purchasing with your hard-earned dollar. I enjoyed it very much!",1373846400,4,1665,4.897163120567376

5713425,3,B00CBVWWUW,"Valiant effort. WoW!! what a way to work a budget.a straight to dvd new $9.99 in stores( always cheaper on Amazon) always wins me over..give the little guys a chance..Asylum production rate crushes their Big Movie counter parts and also gives opprtunity to creators and actors to see what they got..a company of the people..you go Asylum!!(Asylum read my review!!)my tips on what I would have done in making this movie..Needed more Monsters!!!One will not cut it..no matter how great it is..First: I would have made some less detail monsters (even if they look like crap) in the beginning. This would have(platform) made your monster look even better.. a sqiud(or squids) or basic shaped Manta Rays or smaller swarms..(probably easy for you fx team to do)and have the Robots introduced.. wiping them out in the beginning..and slowly bring in your major threat monster(bad guy) without revealing it in it's entirety..a claw crushing buildigs a giant mouth crunching city structure,people falling carnage ect..ect.. ( city structures which I thought were above average visually good work guys) you could have done alot more withless effort. less is more concept..the CGI was fine just over exposed..Avatar made me Loath (OD'd) on cgi but I understand these are the modern tools of the trade..I accept that..but don't disconnect the commandeer..the control of it's master the humanmind.. maybe 3-4 second ant's eye view of the major monster standing tall menacing head high above.. debris falling of it's massive frame.. then cut!!  change the scene..take it from a Power Ranger level to a theatrical expierence an old school monster genre (with your CGI work!! ) which I thought for it's budget was above average..(kudos to you )I also liked the low budget inside the robot scenes very crude though it captivated me..I felt like i was that little kid again left to my own demise play time baby..good work who thought that out it was child like and fun to watch and probably saved alot of $$$..and funny as to compare to the over the top $$$$ scenes inside the robot of the block-buster Pacific Rim..LOL!!Awsome slap to face.. but I felt the movie team worked alot harder then they had to in some areas..relying too much on your CGI..showing your main moster to much..will bore the audience..keep some of your monster (not bad visually Good Work ) a mystery.close ups of tails swinginging..mouths crunching..claws destructing close ups of scary eyes ect..ect..I enjoyed the movie regardless..(some scenes even more than P.R.)and of felt that people busted their backs on fx and are learning.. polishing their creative skills.shoot your films like a well rendered comic book / graphic novel..which drawn in all med camera  angle is boring to watch or read if it's on paper or on screen (very Large paper)..this review is not to bash your movie..it is to inspire you to Humanize your talent and to only use your CGI tools to project them..not the other way around..the computer can not match the power of that pulsating bulb of flesh (brain) we have in our skulls..back to work Low budget masters..as Roger Corman said; he never made a movie he loss money on..study his style and infuse it with your technology..jurassic 3 went back to some scenes with puppet hydrolics and mixed it with CGI..= awesome effect.also Del Toro's Hell boy 2 did it (costumes & CGI) so well we couldn't distinquish the difference..think people.. and let the power of your mind and heart flow..I believe all involved in this movie will move on to do great things. I wish I was younger and by your side..watching..listening..and giving my 2 cents(maybe 3 cents I talk alot) for I am a creature they call the T.V. Baby raised in the froth 60's 70's and 8o's Cartoons & movies..(father worked alot no $$ for summer camps just lit 2x2 thick glass screen T.V) shake that piggy-bank..throw those few $$ coins $$ of finance on the table..and really THINK..I will be your eyes & ears here in the cyber sphere..maybe when I'm retired I can help mold a generation of unique movie makers that the world will never forget..good luck Asylum..the 3 star is not to bash but to inspire & motivate..your minds are more powerful than any multi million or billion dollar tech equipment ..your Asylum costumer for life.(what little I hav left..eyes and hands are gettin a little worn..)sorry this is so long..NOTE: if I walked around your workin teams like Yoda at the Jedi Academy..LOL!! it would've been more proficient..see you next time.. go get em!!!",1408147200,,4507,4.921156373193167
