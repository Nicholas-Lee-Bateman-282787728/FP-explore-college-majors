8023750,3,B00028G6GM,"As stated in the product information, this film is just over 37 minutes long and is full screen.  I thought most of it was well-filmed.  There's very little narration, just a few comments here and there that don't add anything to the experience.  My major complaints are as follows: the quick editing (why can't makers of modern surf films understand that we want to see complete rides from start to finish?  Don't cut to the next shot so fast!); the soundtrack (the sound quality was not so good, and a lot of the music was terrible.  Rap and hip-hop have no place in a surf movie.  That stuff is filth); and the lack of female surfers (there are only a few quick shots of women, and some of those are just walking or laying on the beach - women surf, too!).",1326758400,,759,4.347517730496454
