8387491,5,B0032IO6AW,"After my wife suffered a stroke earlier this year, I ordered this DVD plus several other books to help us in our recovery journey together. When we watched this DVD my wife was almost in tears, telling me that ""Finally somebody knows what a stroke victim feels like!"". The interviews and suggestions were extremely uplifting and positive and were a great help to my wife as part of her recovery process. If someone wants to find both help and understanding after having a stroke, this DVD will really be a worthwhile investment. A quality production in every way.",1291420800,4,563,4.755102040816326
