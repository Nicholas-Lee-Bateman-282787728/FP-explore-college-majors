8215921,3,B000UZRT7C,"Aptly directed, with fine performances by Kate Leahey, Keith Harris and Brandon Roberts.  The premise loses a bit of steam during the second act, but finishes strongly, both thematically and emotionally.",1194220800,,203,5.548387096774194
8215922,4,B000UZRT7C,"Despite its potentially inflammatory title, Chicks 101 is a sweet and funny romantic comedy that offers a positive message about love and perception.  Giving humorous insight into both how men and women see relationships, the witty script and great performance of lead actor R. Keith Harris will leave you smiling.  It has some good natured humor which delivers some good laughs, and a storyline that doesn't leave you feeling cheated.",1187654400,,435,5.2
8215923,5,B000UZRT7C,I saw this movie in the theater and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD ever since.  Chicks 101 is one of those rare movies that strikes a perfect blend of comedy and romance to tell a great story.,1187222400,2,205,3.880952380952381
8215924,4,B000UZRT7C,"To all Fellow Ladies - Don't be fooled by the title - this movie is really a ""Chick Flick"" - you'll want to watch it with your significant other, because there are some GREAT pointers for the men in your life.  Some of the classes are so funny... and TRUE!  R. Keith Harris is great - He carries the film as  likable womanizer Louie King.  Kate Lahey also packs a punch as the Ultra-Feminist Marla.  Definitely worth the purchase.",1187136000,,430,4.3924050632911396
8215925,3,B000UZRT7C,"I really enjoyed Keith's performance in Chicks101, as a womanizing cad who finds redemption. This is an easy-going, gentle comedy with a lot of depth. It will challenge your cynicism.",1187136000,,183,5.133333333333334
