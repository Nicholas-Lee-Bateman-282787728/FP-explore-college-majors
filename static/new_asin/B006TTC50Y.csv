5016483,3,B006TTC50Y,"When I opened this the outside looked to be in great condition. I opened it, Sixteen Candles was loose in the case and the little holder thing that holds The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles was broken. Great DVD's though. They are still playable, just a little bit annoying to put away.",1357689600,2,289,4.576923076923077
5016484,5,B006TTC50Y,"The only thing that would have made this collection better would have been if Pretty In Pink was there instead of Fast Times. But, still, a terrific buy!

5016518,5,B006TTC50Y,"Three 80's movies that stand the test of time. The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles are John Hughes movies, and I would recommend to any teen. Hughes really had a grasp on telling ""teen"" life, and is still relatable now. Fast Times is a great movie also, but being R rated with nudity and drug use, I would recommend for older teens.",1474675200,,335,4.419354838709677

They're very nostalgic, filled with classic one-liners. If you haven't seen these films before, what planet have you been living on?
The picture quality on the DVD's were all excellent. They looked great on my blu-ray player which upscales DVD's.

5016605,4,B006TTC50Y,"I agree with the other reviewers that its too bad Pretty in Pink isn't taking the place of Fast Times to make it a Molly Ringwald trilogy but the reason it's not is because it's a Universal combo pack, it's not a John Hughes pack. Pretty in Pink was made by Paramount. There's another 80s teen combo pack with it and others made at Paramount. Most all combo movie packs and double features have to do with the studio that produced it and not necessarily the actors or directors. But anyone who loves 80s teen movies and is missing at least 2 of these in their collection, it's worth it. I already had Fast Times so I bought it for the other two.",1414195200,,645,4.252032520325203

5016613,5,B006TTC50Y,As a Gen X'er John Hughes was and is my idol! This set has three 80's classics (2 by Hughes and 'Fast Times' directed by Amy Heckerling) that I can never get enough of. It is amazing that 30 yrs later (gasp!) no film maker has yet to achieve what Hughes did with his amazing teen melodramas. You will not be disappointed!,1407974400,,321,4.193548387096774

The Breakfast Club starring 5 teenagers that all hang out in different social circles and have to spend a Saturday in detention together for various reasons.  Once they start talking and getting to know one another, they realize that they are not so different after all.
Sixteen Candles - as a teenage girl I too loved Jake Ryan.  Molly Ringwald is in love with him too, but does he know she exists?  With all of the commotion going on with relatives in town for her sister's wedding, her parents even forget her birthday!  Are her and Jake meant to be?  I think most of you know.  And everyone loves Long Duck Dong.
Fast Times at Ridgemont High- This is a definite coming of age film.  Learning about sex, love, and growing up.",1404432000,,755,4.5

5016662,5,B006TTC50Y,This DVD set is great for those who want to share the '80's with their teenagers.  Not recommended for anyone under 15 yrs without parental guidance (my opinion).  Gave me an opportunity to share with my teen that things are still basically the same (we just did not have technology/ social media back then) and that every choice we make has a consequence (positive or negative).,1395360000,,379,4.7272727272727275

Very family-friendly for tweens and teenagers.  Some of the drug references and beginning sexuality might be too much for younger children.,1394323200,,312,5.326530612244898

Loved every minute and every song brought back high school memories. Someone mentioned they wish Pretty In Pink was included, but it was made by a different studio so it would not go with a 100 year anniversary edition from a company that didn't produce it.

Sixteen Candles - girls parents forget her birthday.  Girl meets a guy with a Porche, celebrates her sixteenth birthday with him.  Dad finally realizes the her birthday was over look, because there was something happening in the household.  Gets boy at the end.

I was hoping it came in time for her birthday even though I was ordering late (why I didn't think of this sooner I'll never know) but to my surprise....This is the quickest standard delivery that I have ever seen.

5016743,3,B006TTC50Y,I love these movies. I started watching the Breakfast Club and right after I was going to watch 16 Candles. Unfortunately not even half way through on 16 Candles the disc skipped. I got up to clean it only to discover that the entire disc was covered in scratches. So I can't watch that one. Overall it's still a good deal due to the fact that one disc worked but I could have saved 4 dollars and gone to walmart to buy the breakfast club for $5.,1370044800,,446,4.137931034482759

5016763,5,B006TTC50Y,"Why anyone would buy any one of these movies individually when this set is so well priced, is beyond me. It costs only a couple dollars more than ""Sixteen Candles"" all by itself. I was most impressed with the fact that there are three separate discs, each with artwork (not just the blank bare discs). Of course the movies are awesome and though I've only watched two of them since I got the set they've worked perfectly without any freezes, skips or image quality problems. Buy it! You won't regret it!",1364428800,11,503,4.538461538461538
5016764,1,B006TTC50Y,I chose this product because the bundle of three movies was only a couple dollars more than The Breakfast Club by itself.  I was actually using clips from that film for a presentation.  I opened the case the night before the presentation to find that it was merely a disc of Fast Times At Ridgemont High.  How does that happen?  No one is double checking these things?  Very disappointed.,1364083200,,388,4.565217391304348
