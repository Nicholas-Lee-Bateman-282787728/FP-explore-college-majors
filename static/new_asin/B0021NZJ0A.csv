8349426,3,B0021NZJ0A,"Death Sport, 1978, Drive-In original release. David
Carradine, Claudia Jennings, Richard Lynch, Jessie
Vint (who played a psycho killer in an episode of
Hawai'i Five-0, just one-and-a-half yrs., earlier).

In the year 3000, A.D.(!!), Carradine and Jennings
are the goodies, who race destruto-cycles v. Lynch
and Vint. Lynch gets beheaded at the end. This film
is a little better than 1975's Death Race 2000, but
comes across as a bit disjointed since it went thru
three directors (including Carradine, who did second
unit shots he wasn't in. It is much faster paced and
shorter than the uber-gory / tongue-in-cheek Death
Rasce 2000, which has a better plot and cast.
