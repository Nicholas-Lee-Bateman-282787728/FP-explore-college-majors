8379918,2,B002T5QME2,"The Midway DVD was about Bob Ballard trying to find two sunken aircraft carriers, but the veteran interviews were good. The D-Day DVD was only 36 minutes long and included interviews with 4 veterans (one of the British men was difficult to understand). I didn't watch the other DVDs. I was expecting more from an ""ultimate"" WWII collection.
