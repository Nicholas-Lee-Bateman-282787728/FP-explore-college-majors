8316799,4,B001L1D0IQ,"Through flash backs we are seeing how Miss Maple
became an old maid when her love ( a married man) died
in the first world war.
The clever device of this mystery is the convoluted
time line that seems to clear the wife and her lover
early on.
The villain still appears to be the murdered man Colonel Prothero
who seems to have made a fortune by his special services
betrayal of French resistance fighters during WWII.
I liked this movie.",1260403200,2,437,4.407407407407407
