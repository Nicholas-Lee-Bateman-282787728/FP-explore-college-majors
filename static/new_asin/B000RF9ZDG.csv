Her most famous, critically acclaimed role was in the 1956 Yield To The Night, based on the sensational story of hanged British murderess Ruth Ellis.  This DVD collection also includes Diana in youthful co-starring roles in Lady Godiva Rides Again, Diamond City, As Long As They're Happy, A Boy A Girl & A Bike, and A Kid For Two Farthings, plus a bonus disc with an excellent made for BBC-TV re-enacted bio of Dors' life called Blonde Bombshell.  You must have an all-region DVD player to view this set (Region 2 U.K.), several of these are available here on Amazon at reasonable prices, they hook easily into American TV sets.",1477958400,2,711,4.764227642276423
