8683671,5,B00OHNH6EO,"I bought the 1st DVD series over a year ago- Learn Fencing (A Beginner's Guide Sword Fighting) which covers Foil, &Eacute;p&eacute;e, & Sabre. A great technical reference guide to fencing.
  This new DVD Learn Fencing: Advance sabre is a great tool for the beginner to intermediate sabre fencer. I am a &Eacute;p&eacute;e and Foil fencer that dapples in Sabre fencing once in a while. This advanced DVD series is more like it complete guide to fencing and preparation for competition. I picked up a lot of nice sabre specific fencing drills I can work on by myself or with a partner. I learned some nice tricks in this video too.
I don't just recommend this advance sabre dvd, I recommend a whole series, &Eacute;p&eacute;e, Foil, and Sabre.",1418342400,7,741,4.826771653543307
