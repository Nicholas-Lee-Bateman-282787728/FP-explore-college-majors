8690926,3,B00Q95MEXG,"Unlike ads often say for many European releases this one really does require a region B or multiregion (eg Orei) blueray player. Also it is only in French with English subtitles.  Its a very offbeat low budget scifi and stops rather abruptly, but though its effects are limited they were quite nice and we really liked it. As with many other European releases (Henry and Julie, Largo Winch 2 etc)  the 3D is fake so you won't lose alot by watching in 2D.",1457481600,,454,4.457831325301205
