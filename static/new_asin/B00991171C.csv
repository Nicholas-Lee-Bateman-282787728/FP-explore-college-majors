8537740,3,B00991171C,"I love George Kennedy and while he makes a great effort in this film, I don't know...it's a very convoluted plot that seems rather ridiculous, and you'll have to suspend your disbelief for awhile. An insurance exec finds out he has a brain tumor. Not only does he refuse surgery (it might leave him paralyzed) but HE DOESN'T TELL HIS WIFE!! Also for some dumb reason this insurance exec doesn't have adequate life insurance, SO he frames himself for a murder he didn't commit so his wife can collect the reward money. There's more to it and Kennedy is very good, as usual (AND there's a nude scene of his backside!! Wowee), but the actress who plays his wife was kind of homely and shrill (I thought). Eli Wallach puts in a GREAT performance as Kennedy's attorney. I was really disappointed with the ending. I can't recommend buying it, but if you can see it for free, it wouid be worth a look.",1518652800,,894,4.49079754601227
8537741,5,B00991171C,"Great film, George Kennedy is great, Eli Wallach is excellent as the lawyer, great overlooked action drama from the 1970's. Check this out A+++++++",1446336000,2,147,5.166666666666667
8537742,4,B00991171C,"This is a compelling story that takes some genuine twists and a surprise ending.  It was a great performance by George Kennedy and Eli Wallach.  I saw this as a young person and always wanna copy.  This is one of those ""hard to find"" films, but worth seeing.",1427155200,,258,4.333333333333333
8537743,4,B00991171C,"Twisty little caper, well-done, ahead of its time. Kennedy isn't often given the reigns to hold, he does a credible job. Plot is very nice, kind of a crime caper take on Popi, if you remember that Alan Arkin flick from a million years ago. (Still remember the catchy little ditty. ""la--la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la -- POPI!"")",1426291200,,326,5.055555555555555

8537745,2,B00991171C,"I had seen this movie when I was young and at that time, I loved it, because I love George Kennedy movies.  So I could hardly wait for the movie to be released onto DVD.  When I bought it, and watched it, I was bored with it, because it was nothing as I remembered.  Even being a big fan of George Kennedy did not make the movie any better.  I wish I had not bought it, but since it was not available from Netflix, I did not know it would be a disappointment for me now.",1365292800,,470,3.8645833333333335
