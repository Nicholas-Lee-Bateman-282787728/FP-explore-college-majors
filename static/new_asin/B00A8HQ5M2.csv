8548223,4,B00A8HQ5M2,"Hot Aches' Paul Diffley has once again taken a tough topic - offwidth or crack climbing - and put a soft human angle to it. Whether you climb or not, are a go getter or just a wannabe - this film is full of insight, inspiration and motivation. Tracking two Brits - Pete Whittaker and Tom Randall - through two years of training in preparation for their virgin visit to America's crack climbing ultimate destination, the film makes your hands and feet ache, but you just ignore that and keep watching to the end.

As Climbing Master -and inspiration for their adventure - Stevie Hanson said: ""It's a lot of work, but that's what makes it rewarding in the long run.""

But's it is not just the climbers who push beyond their limits. Once again Hot Aches shows no fear in filming the unusual.

The mutual respect climbers Pete and Tom have for each other and their 'sweet science' , as offwidth climber Bob Scarpelli called it, is reflected in the respect Paul Diffley, shows for both climbing and the climbers. As Pete says, you need to be obsessive to be a good climber.  Well, Diffley is obsessive about getting up close and personal with the people, personalities, and passions climbers have. For this we all benefit.

Definitely a must watch. It already won The People's Choice and Best Climbing Film awards at Kendal Mountain Film Festival 2012.
