8165009,3,B000LXHFO0,"To me the stories are not what makes these segments original. Rather it's an interesting view for those interested in actors-chemistry. The cover doesn't really do this film justice which i think more suggest a film about sexuality . The segments are not specifically about seduction, but more about sacrifice and power between men and women. Henry Miller's ""Mara"" is wellacted and the most outstanding of the segments. But Hemingway's ""Hills like white elephants"" makes the strongest impression, mostly due to Melanie Griffith, which wonderful, true and emotional performance together with James Wood almost make your heart expand.",1376870400,3,632,5.459183673469388
