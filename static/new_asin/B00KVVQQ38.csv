6451928,4,B00KVVQQ38,"""The Notebook"" (2013 release from Hungary; 112 min.; not to be confused with the 2004 Nicolas Sparks movie of the same name) brings the story of twin boys (I'm guessing 11 or 12 years old; we never learn their names) who face long odds trying to survive WWII. As the movie opens, the twins' dad returns home for a few days, to the family's delight. Alas, all too soon he returns to the war front, and it is decided that the boys should be moved to live with their grandmother's somewhere on the country side. We are told that it is ""August 14, 1944"", and the boys get a big notebook, which Dad urges them to write ""everything that you experience, I want to know everything"". Grandma is at first sight a bitter, alcoholic and maybe even sadistic old lady who is making life for the boys miserable (she complains when the boys' mom shows up to drop them off that she hadn't seen her own daughter in 20 years). At this point we are maybe 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is based on the 1986 book of the same name written by Agota Kristof (and is only the first of a trilogy, followed by ""The Proof"" and ""The Third Lie""). Second, BEWARE: this is at times a bleak, tough and harrowing movie that pulls no punches (literally) about what the boys encounter as they try to hang on for dear life and survive the war. The boys at one point decide that they need to train their bodies against pain, hunger, and anything good that might happen. You'd think the boys might become bitter, but on the contrary, it only emboldens them to become tougher and more determined than ever to survive. There are many other aspects in the movie that are too complex to discuss in a short review here, but suffice to say that this is no Hollywood-glorified version of WWII (I'm looking at you, ""Fury"", and the like). Third, the acting performances will leave you breathless. The young actors plays the boys are in fact twins in real life. I can't say that I've ever heard of or seen any of these performers before, but I can tell you that the woman playing the grandmother will blow you away, playing such an unsympathetic role. Last but not least, there is a terrific and mostly electronic soundtrack which is as dark and haunting as the movie is. Unfortunately I couldn't make out from the (Hungarian) end titles who composed the soundtrack. ""The Notebook"" was the official submission of Hungary to the Oscars 2014 best foreign language film category (it made the final pre-selection but was not nominated), and it is easy to see why, as ""The Notebook"" is a top-notch quality movie that will move you and leave a deep impression.

""The Notebook"" came out last weekend without any pre-release hype or fanfare at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figured this would not stick around very long so I went to see it right away. The early evening screening where I saw this at was a semi-private screening (as in: there was one other person there besides myself). I can't say it surprised me, but don't let this mislead you as to the quality of the movie. If you get a chance to check out ""The Notebook"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Bly-ray, don't miss it. Incidentally, this particular listing seems to be an import DVD from Germany. I have no idea if this plays onto US DVD players. I assume that at some point there will be a 'regular' US release of this. All that aside, ""The Notebook"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1413331200,15,3551,4.478395061728395

6451930,5,B00KVVQQ38,"A very disturbing film but then there was a war going on and therefore there is nothing glorious about any war so these scenes attempt to show the harshness that wars bring about. The film started out like a family affair with the father telling the twins to write everything down in a notebook. Then he went off to fight the war; the mother meanwhile had her business and so she left the twins off at their grandmother's who immediately rejected them--refused them to eat or even let them in her house. Then the Germans moved in and set up camp right outside her property.

So nothing was going right for the twins and realizing that they are left basically to themselves, they now feel something must be done in order to survive. As the war raged on the mother finally appeared married and with child to a German only to be blown up by aircraft fire; the grandmother finally died; the father also returning a much different man. The movie ended which was really disturbing and misunderstood by me were the twins who were never ever apart since birth finally decided to go their separate ways. I am still trying to figure that one out. Nevertheless and based on all the readings I've done on wars this film did appear to be somewhat realistic and although some of the scenes were disturbing I still gave it a good rating.",1453939200,,1322,4.508333333333334
6451931,5,B00KVVQQ38,Very moving and real. I was riveted throughout. The twins were out of this world.,1452988800,,81,4.466666666666667
6451932,5,B00KVVQQ38,I really enjoyed the film.  How these twins dealt with the realities of WWII was sad/disturbing/realistic.  I don't really know how to describe it  I cried before it was over.  Don't do that too often.,1447804800,,201,4.6571428571428575
6451933,5,B00KVVQQ38,What an interesting movie. If your a film buff or interested in period films (Nazi war) you will find interesting to see how these character's survive daily living.,1446681600,,164,4.892857142857143

6451937,4,B00KVVQQ38,This film was far better than I had expected .The twist and turns and surprising ending made it very enjoyable.,1440374400,2,111,4.6
8662009,5,B00KVVQQ38,A very touching movie that takes place during WWII in Hungry.  The twin boys are pretty much abandoned as their father goes off to war and their mother decides she doesn't want to care for them and sends them to their drunken grandmothers who they have never met before.  The boys experience nothing but abuse and cruelty from there on and decide they must become tougher so they can absorb and survive this cruel world.  Eventually they become vengeful and experience death from all around them and in the end split to go their own unique direction.,1492646400,,550,4.649484536082475
8662010,5,B00KVVQQ38,"Supreme movie about the hardships of war, disruption of families, growing up in a decaying society and mixed feelings among friends, enemies and next to kin. Boys acting is great. Highly recommended!",1488585600,,199,5.25

8662015,5,B00KVVQQ38,"It's difficult to say ""I Liked It"" as it's difficult to watch. I think every teacher, case worker & mental health professional should watch it, discuss & watch it again. It is a great teaching guide & shows very well how children are taught not to feel.
I highly recommend this feel due to the subject matter, acting, directing, production & filming. It's a first class film & one which American producers should try to emulate. The twins are exceptional actors as well as the grandma. See it, buy it & share it.",1469232000,2,512,4.516129032258065
8662016,4,B00KVVQQ38,"This is a very disturbing film in many ways.  It depicts the behavior of young teen twins in response to a violent, obscene and cruel world.  It is a dark, twisted portrayal that questions basic humanity.  While vile, and tough to watch, the film was exceptional in all aspects except one.  The ending was non plausible.  But then, so was the finale of the Soprano's.",1468713600,,367,4.584615384615384
8662017,3,B00KVVQQ38,"It was okay, well written with deep feelings between the twins and very realistically settings of the war",1461024000,,105,4.888888888888889
8662018,5,B00KVVQQ38,"This is an excellent DVD because it contains the point of view among those in Eastern Europe.  Two Twin boys have their world turned upside down by destructive events towards the end of World War II.  For their safety a desperate Mother leaves her twin sons with relatives in the country with the hope they will avoid dangers.  The war is inhumane.  Their Father disappears.  Their Mother has an affair with a Nazi Soldier.  At the end both boys go their separate ways completely unfeeling and merciless.  It may seem offensive in some scenes.  In one both boys are nude and in a tub bathing with a woman.  That is war, and it requires some changes to endure.  A true lifelike movie does not always have a happy ending.  This movie really portrayed how lives were changed forever by war - and not for the best.",1457049600,2,810,4.47945205479452
