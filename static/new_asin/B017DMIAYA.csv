8738717,3,B017DMIAYA,"Looks like an awesome collection for an awesome show, as I was trying to find a set that included The Peacekeeper Wars, which other descriptions of this set I've read says it does. However, the Amazon description for this collection was inaccurate when I bought it but has now been updated to include the fact that this is a region 2 / PAL disc set only, meaning it won't play in most America players or display correctly on American TVs. Unfortunate, as this looks like a great collectible for any Farscape fan and I have yet to find a region 1 compatible version of The Peacekeeper Wars on Blu Ray.",1468108800,6,600,4.463636363636364
8738718,5,B017DMIAYA,"Beautifully designed book like Blu-ray collection. For any Farscape fan, this collection is amazing.
It includes the Peacekeeper Wars tele-film which was not originally part of the DVD box sets. Speaking of that film, it does look rough on blu-ray. Still, I suppose that's the best that we could hope for.

Cheers!",1467676800,,314,5.038461538461538
