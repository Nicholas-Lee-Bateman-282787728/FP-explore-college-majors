8249682,5,B0013B34X0,"One of the most insightful, keen observers of romantic relationships in his native Iran, writer-director Asghar Farhadi has earned an international following with a pair of exquisite dramas about marriages gone wrong, The Past (2013) and A Separation, which won the 2012 Oscar for best foreign film.

Thanks to his Oscar, there's a market for all things Farhadi in America, including his earlier work. That includes 2006's Fireworks Wednesday, a loopy, off-the-wall tragicomedy that chronicles a particularly stressful day in the life of a miserably unhappy couple whose marriage is on its last legs.

It's the eve of Iran's biggest secular holiday, the Persian New Year, and as the city of Tehran buzzes with activity, the couple are at each other's throats.

A comedy of bad manners that puts an Iranian spin on Pedro Almodvar's Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Fireworks Wednesday covers the same thematic terrain as the later films, without their polished perfection. Its absurdist comic tone, which we haven't seen before from this director, is fascinating and immensely enjoyable.

Hedye Tehrani stars as Mozhde, an upper-middle-class woman in her 30s whose decadelong marriage to the abusive, selfish Morteza (Hamid Farokhnezhad) has reduced her to a quivering, paranoid mess. Convinced her husband is having an affair with one of their neighbors, she's constantly spying at keyholes, pressing her ear to closed doors, and listening intently at ventilation shafts.

As her suspicions grow, so does her husband's abuse - when he catches her spying on him outside his office building, he beats her in the middle of the street.

Farhadi has a talent for grounding his memorable characters in their cultural context. His films aren't about the abstract idea of romance. They show how relationships are shaped - and twisted - in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a theocratic, paternalistic state.

Fireworks Wednesday tells this couple's story from the point of view of their new cleaning lady, Roohi (Taraneh Alidoosti). A young, beautiful working-class woman who is days away from her own wedding, Roohi is a naive, innocent soul who's fascinated and perplexed by the goings on around her.

She comes off as a simpleton - all wide-eyed and open-jawed - as she insinuates herself in every aspect of her employer's daily life. Yet she's so charming, so brimming with life, it's hard not to fall in love with her - even as we are increasingly repulsed by everyone around her.

We have to wonder where Roohi will be in 10 years. Will she still be joyous, fresh, and alive? Or will marriage Islamic Republic-style kill that spirit?

Can love ever truly thrive in this soil?",1464912000,,2679,5.068181818181818

8249684,3,B0013B34X0,"This film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi (A Separation, About Elly) is well made, though in my opinion he has done better films. There are elements in this movie you see in other films of the director: heated marital discussions, secrets and lies coming to the light, cultural differences between the middle class and the working class. However, the end result is not as compelling as in other of his movies.
The action transpires on a single day in Tehran during the celebration of the Iranian new year (a holiday where a lot of fireworks are thrown). The young Rouhi (played by the pretty and talented Taraneeh Alidosti, who was in About Elly), is a working class woman that will soon marry her boyfriend. She gets a temporary job cleaning a apartment in a middle class neighborhood. Upon arriving at the apartment she finds herself in the middle of a heated domestic dispute between Mojdeh and Morteza. Mojdeh (Heyde Tehrani) suspects that her husband Morteza is cheating on her with the next door neighbor Simin, a woman who set up a beauty salon there after her own marriage broke up. Over the course of the day, Rouhi, the fighting couple, their small son, the wife's sister and husband, and the beautician engage in a series of exchanges and confrontations, as the truth unfolds.
Of course, the central conceit of the film, that the residents of the apartment complex would trust this cleaning lady they barely know so much they would confide to her all their problems, is absurd. At one point, Mojdeh even asks Rouhi to pick her young son at school (she has only known her for a few hours, and already trusts her to fetch her son, whom she has never met!)
Not knowing much about Iranian culture, I was intrigued by the relationship between Rouhi and her boyfriend. I suppose Iran being a culturally conservative country their relationship before marriage is non sexual, yet they seem so close and loving, especially at the opening scenes of the movie. But the movie doesnt dwell too much in this, a pity since you don't see much about young love in Iranian movies.",1397692800,,2076,4.7217630853994494
8249685,5,B0013B34X0,"Centred around the events of a single day, this is a riveting movie about the complex web of human relationships. Although an earlier work from ""A Separation"" it is just as vivid and engrossing. The actors are well-cast and bring a lot of nuance to their performances. It feels so real. This movie's a gem of world cinema. Definitely a keeper!",1370131200,4,343,4.639344262295082
8249686,4,B0013B34X0,"This is a beautiful film, set in the backdrop of the New Year festivities which are taking place in the city with the fireworks which are an important part of the ancient Zoroastrian tradition.

The beautiful heroine Rouhi after her first day at a new job, she arrives home at the apartment she finds herself in the middle of a heated domestic dispute between Mojdeh and Morteza. Mojdeh suspects that her husband Morteza is cheating on her with the next door neighbor Simin, a Turkish woman who set up a beauty salon there after her own marriage broke up.

So over the course of a day, the young woman, couple, their son, the wife's sister and husband, and the  pretty beautician engage in a series of exchanges, arguments, and prevarications as the truth unfolds.

World class acting, this is one of those films that stays in the memory. Recommend.",1319846400,3,849,4.677852348993288
8249687,4,B0013B34X0,The other reviewers have done an excellent job of presenting this film. It's a powerful and mesmerizing story of gender and class conflict with a pace that never lets up.

8249688,4,B0013B34X0,"""Fireworks Wednesday"" is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of men and women living in contemporary Iran. It's fiction, but it's a compelling and honest contemporary story of an idealistic young woman from a working-class background who is on the verge of getting married -- and takes on a job as a cleaning woman for an up-scale family to make some extra money.

She shows up in the midst of disaster. The husband seems to be a brute, there's broken glass strewn across the floor and the man's wife shows up soon -- full of upper-class biases and in the midst of an emotional crisis over her husband's behavior. It's not entirely clear, at first, what has happened in the household -- but watching this drama is an amazing window in the lives of everyday Iranian families.

For Americans, one of the enormous challenges in our world today is seeing the humanity in distant nations -- especially nations like Iran with which our nation's leaders seem to be crossing swords. Spending a couple of hours with this Iranian melodrama puts sympathetic human faces on people half a world away. And that's an important thing in times of global tension.

This is well-written drama with sophisticated characters and a plot that keeps us guessing along the way -- whether we see ourselves in the roles of the older upper-class couple struggling to come to terms with an explosive marriage or we see the world through the eyes of the idealistic young woman about to get married.",1212019200,4,1469,4.752941176470588
8249689,5,B0013B34X0,"Rouhi is engaged and very much in love, and goes to work as a maid in the house of a couple on the verge of a meltdown.  The wife is a nervous and suspicious wreck, and the messy house and broken window confirm that this is not a scene of domestic tranquility.  Throughout the day, Rouhi becomes increasingly involved in the lives of the wife, her husband and their child, and the woman who the wife suspects of being her husband's mistress.  She takes sides and later regrets it; she is used as a pawn in an elaborate contest between the husband and wife.  Along the way she must begin to wonder about her own dreams of a happy ever after.

The film takes place on the Wednesday prior to the Iranian New Year, when according to tradition there is a fireworks celebration in the streets.  One of the most engaging and frightening scenes occurs as the husband drives Rouhi home through streets ablaze and abuzz with explosions, rockets, bonfires.  The sounds, lights and explosions that surround them as they speed through the streets, avoiding flames, mirrors the volatility of the marriage -- and accelerates the tension within the car, given the husband's suspicion that Rouhi may have betrayed him to his wife.

Fireworks Wednesday is an honest and subtle and provocative film that takes a very simple and utterly believable story and lets a set of complicated issues weave in and through it effortlessly.  A very intriguing portrait of life in Tehran, with exceptionally delicate and convincing performances, and masterful direction that is able to take a scene from everyday life and render it extremely interesting and unsettling and suspenseful.",1205452800,15,1652,4.850533807829182
