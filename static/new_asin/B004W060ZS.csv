8444247,4,B004W060ZS,"This rebounding workout is a mix of rebounding and floor work using the rebounder. I don't find it as aerobic as other rebounding routines I've done. There is no warm-up, as Keli begins with cross-country skiing. She repeats her routines enough so they are easy to follow. About 5 minutes into the routine, she picks up sand weights. There is a segment of jumping on & off the mat with both feet, as in a squat-jump, and another with one foot and balancing. Since rebounding is suppose to be easy on the joints, I'm not sure the effect of the jumps on knees. She doesn't give alternative moves. Keli seems out of breath a lot, wheras her younger crew are extremely energetic. There is a short mat work at the end for abs and cool-down. Only 4 stars because I would prefer more rebounding. There are plenty of DVD's for floor work, so when I choose rebounding, that's what I want.",1308009600,17,879,4.46583850931677
8444248,4,B004W060ZS,"If you are looking for an intense workout that tones your entire body and gets your heart rate up, this work out is for you. Keli Roberts seriously kicked my butt! I couldn't finish the workout 100% and I did need to pause a few times to get a drink and catch my breathe, so there is something for me to work up to.

I gave this four out of five stars because it would have been nice if there were more than 1 workout on the DVD, especially since it is about $20.

With that being said, I probably will look into getting another workout from this series in the future.",1307145600,5,568,4.0625
