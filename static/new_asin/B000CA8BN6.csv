8096519,1,B000CA8BN6,"Do not fall for this scam!  1) No libretto, or program; just a one page with a bare bones decription. 2) It did not play on my regular DVD, which ejected it time after time.  3) It did play on my computer, but no subtitles, no orchestra, no scenery to speak off.  A pianist with a conductor! They might be speaking a dead language, which they are.  After all the hulabaloo about ""the first Yiddish Opera"", it does not even qualify as performance.
I looked at the DVD again.  Its description reads ""all regions"".  Not true.  the DVD itself says ""Regions 3 and 4"", which are not playable in most American DVD players.",1437177600,2,615,4.389380530973451
