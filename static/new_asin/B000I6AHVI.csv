2653385,2,B000I6AHVI,When I ordered this DVD I was at the understanding that I was going to learn to swim better.  However; it was way more basic than it was advertised.  It was completely for someone who was afraid of water or just had not ever swam and needed to learn everything from the beginning. This was very disappointing to me since I needed it to help me improve my current swimming skills for an upcoming triathlon.,1187136000,11,405,4.386666666666667
2653386,4,B000I6AHVI,I'm constantly trying to improve my swimming skills and was recently steered toward Total Immersion swimming.  This DVD clearly demonstrates the drills and lessons of the Total Immersion Swim School.  It was instructional and clear and I found it to be very helpful. The concept of swimming on your side instead of flat to the surface is a real advancement in grace and speed. The DVD is easy to follow and the lessons are spelled out clearly. I'm mastering the drills and look forward to swimming like a fish soon! I recommend this product to anyone interested in improving their swim skills.,1181692800,15,593,4.803921568627451

8144236,5,B000I6AHVI,Great video that shows you how to become comfortable in the water.  Perfect video for those with a fear of water.,1380412800,,113,4.380952380952381
8144237,4,B000I6AHVI,"This is a great dvd companion to the Total Immersion book. The book covers important concepts and introduced many new terms and swimming techniques so it is very helpful to see stroke by stroke live illustration in the dvd instead of merely trying to grasp the concept from text.

The dvd is not the highest in quality though, looks slightly better than a home video but it does the job fine. A word of caution for total new beginners to swimming. The series of dvds coupled with the Total Immersion book may not be sufficient to get you learn swimming completely. With all the new found knowledge, many people will toss them out the window and started to panic once they are in the water. I highly recommend taking some beginner swimming classes with a coach and use the excellent learning resources to jump start your swimming journey. I didn't personally take swimming lessons under the new immersion style certified coaches, but I heard good things about them.",1329091200,,964,4.738095238095238
8144238,2,B000I6AHVI,"This is purely for beginners and those afraid of the water. Splashing water on your face, getting your face under water, floating, touching your toes -- basic ""let's play in the water"" games. Only a few of the 39 minutes relates to swimming, amounting to nothing more than a promo for another $50 video. If you or a friend or relative has truly never been in the water before, this might be a 5 star product. It might be just the thing for those who need a lot of hand-holding and reassurance. But don't expect to learn to swim from it, much less learn to swim laps with the big boys. ""Happy Splashing in the Wading Pool"" is more like it.",1299715200,8,638,4.2809917355371905
8144239,2,B000I6AHVI,I was disappointed in this video since the exercises require two people.  Didn't really find it useful.,1271203200,2,103,5.0588235294117645
8144240,4,B000I6AHVI,"I learned how to float and do a few strokes from this video.  However, I did not learn how to breathe rythmmically like the swimmers in the slow lane.

For an adult beginner, who never had experience swimming, viewing this DVD was a great start.  It gave me the confidence and motivation to do my scissor-kicks.",1264291200,2,311,4.517857142857143
8144241,4,B000I6AHVI,Could not swim a lick and bought this with the swimmers snorkel- with those and a kickboard I think I am doing pretty well-,1250899200,,123,4.166666666666667
8144242,4,B000I6AHVI,"Never mind the background music, the content is pretty basic and real good for absolute starters. Gets some real good basics down..",1227139200,,131,5.0
8144243,4,B000I6AHVI,this DVD is for beginners who want to take the first steps in swimming or someone who is not comfortable in water. I bought this with Free Style Made Easy and I am happy to say that I can now swim.,1207094400,4,197,3.8292682926829267
8144244,5,B000I6AHVI,"This 40 minute DVD managed to do what 5 different swimming instructors and 4 'how to swim' books could not.  It taught me to swim!! If you are an adult that has never learned to swim or is afraid of the water - this is the DVD for you.

The DVD is divided into three lessons and each lesson contains numerous drills. Ideally the drills will be performed with a partner, as shown in the DVD, but I did it on my own.

Lesson One will teach you to be comfortable in the water. Lesson Two teaches you how your body naturally behaves in the water. Lesson Three teaches you a modified swimming ""stroke"" that will allow a beginner to do laps. Once you have mastered this modified swimming ""stroke"", it will be easy to learn the traditional freestyle or backstroke.

All of the instruction takes place in a pool and most of the DVD is filmed under water. An accompanying manual can be downloaded from the totalimmersion.net website. I think this DVD is a gem. But remember it is designed for a beginner. If you are not a novice you will be dissapointed. The Freestyle, Backstroke, Breastroke and ""Betterfly"" DVDs by the same author are better choices for those wanting to improve their technique.

Still not convinced? Take a peak at the sample videos on totalimmersion.net. You won't be disappointed.",1194048000,25,1293,4.58008658008658
