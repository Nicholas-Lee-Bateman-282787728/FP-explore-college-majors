3126824,5,B00149LMDU,Just had to let the world know that this series bundled up in one shot is awesome!!! My wife and I watched this when they finally released it separately season by season and now she really enjoys animated shows in general. I say if you have not watched this yet get it!!,1256083200,,270,4.211538461538462
3126825,5,B00149LMDU,"I grew up on Super Friends and the orginal JLA, but it was geared toward me and my current age at that time. This series hooked myself and my 3 year old. Which says alot for the story writing and character highlights per episode. very complex story arcs give it the feel of prime time shows, without all the tired wit. It's made for kids, plain and simple, but this series does it right with such a range, you not only enjoy the show, it's not a guilty pleasure.  The animation really hasn't dated itself either. They stayed on the cutting edge of the day to give this series a more lasting look. Some of the 3D sequences are slightly aged, but easily over looked. Pit against Superman or Batman: the animated series, this is easily the best one. Each is good in it's right, but if i could choose one, this is it. Not only do you get the same amazing voice talent (Batman), the stories are so rich and varied, you find yourself never bored with the series.",1254096000,18,956,4.311111111111111

The first 15 episodes of Justice League Season One were originally released separately on the single-disc volumes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Origins/dp/B00005Y71H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Origins</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-on-Trial/dp/B000087F7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice on Trial</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Lost/dp/B000096IBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Lost</a>&nbsp;(all on June 1, 2004) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brave-and-the-Bold/dp/B0002MFGE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brave and the Bold</a>&nbsp;(October 19, 2004). Also available on the 4-disc JL Season One set released on March 21, 2006 featuring all 26 episodes (multi-part arcs) in Full-Frame (1.33:1) video with following seasons to be in widescreen as originally animated; plus a host of special features.

The final 3 episodes of Justice League Season Two were originally released separately (before ever airing on TV) on the single-disc volume&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starcrossed-The-Movie/dp/B0001A7V1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starcrossed: The Movie</a>&nbsp;(July 13, 2004) in Anamorphic Widescreen. Also available on the 4-disc JL Season Two set released on June 20, 2006 which oddly featured all 26 episodes (multi-part arcs) in non-Anamorphic Widescreen; plus special features.

6 episodes from the first half of Justice League Unlimted Season One were originally released separately on the single-disc volumes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-the-World/dp/B0006U3SJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving the World</a>&nbsp;(February 15, 2005) and ""Joining Forces"" (September 20, 2005). Also available on the 4-disc Anamorphic Widescreen JLU Season One set released on October 24, 2006 which (despite the ""Season One"" box title) actually contains both JLU Seasons One and Two (each 13 episodes) featuring extras covering only the first half of the 2 in 1 season set with the following season set to include the missing bonus material.

The final 13 episodes of Justice League Unlimited were only released on the 2-disc Anamorphic Widescreen JLU Season Two set released on March 20, 2007 featuring the extra sorely missed from the previous set, ""Cadmus: Exposed"" which resolved the discussion on the popular series story arc; plus other bonus material.

For the Complete Series release, Warner Home Video has lovingly repackaged from the separate season sets all 91 episodes and respective special features (in respective aspect ratios) on 15 single-sided DVDs (including a brand new bonus disc) all in an exclusive collectible box set that does justice to DCAU's League of Extraordinary Superheroes.

Special Features include:
New Bonus Disc Documentary ""Unlimited Reserve: Exploring the Depths of the DC Universe"".

Commentary on 8 episodes with Series Creators: ""The Enemy Below Part 2"", ""Legends Part 2"", ""The Savage Time Part 2"", ""Twilight Part 2"", ""A Better World Part 2"", ""Starcrossed Part 3"", ""This Little Piggy"", ""The Return"".

Featurettes: ""Inside Justice League"", ""The Look of The League"", ""The Blueprint for Justice"", ""Justice League - The First Mission"", ""Voices of Justice"", ""Justice League: Declassified"", ""And Justice for all"", ""Themes of Justice"", ""Cadmus: Exposed"", ""Justice League Chronicles"", Music-only audio track for the final episode ""Destroyer"".

Easter Egg: ""Not too Savage"", a Deleted Scene with an introduction by producer Bruce Timm.

Packaging:
Two large and sturdy digipaks - one for ""Justice League"" featuring Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman cover art identical to the outer case, and one for ""Justice League Unlimited"" featuring Red Tornado, Dr. Fate and Aquaman cover art - inside an outer case.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended, especially for fans who don't own any of the previous season set releases. To fans that already own the previous releases, just know that aside from the bonus disc documentary (and the convenience of complete series packaging) all of the disc content are the same as the previous releases before you decide.",1254009600,269,5185,7.440456769983687
3126827,5,B00149LMDU,"Awesome show but I already own this full set for this series and the Unlimited Series as well. What is the difference with this one? I have been seeing alot of this lately, Transformers the 80's series did the same thing. They came out with another dvd set.",1253664000,3,257,4.375
3126828,5,B00149LMDU,"Ok...
First off, I do not have this particular series collection yet, because it hasn't been released yet.
With the above being said, I can say that I own all of the individual justice league seasons, and they were all incredible, so this set should be at least as good...

This series is Simply one of the best ever...

The wide array of past & new hero's and villians is Great...
The storyline's are Awesome...

You don't see the same characters on every show, you get a great variety...

My daughter watches the shows with me, as it is very suitable for kids of any age, but the writing is so darn good that it really appeals to the adult audience as well...
I remember one of the episodes with SuperGirl(my favorite super hero) where she actually says she was just copping a feel to a male character on the show...
I just think that writing ROCKS!!!!

My only complaint is that the series ended and didn't go longer... I do not understand how a series that good stopped...
I hope Mr. Timm or someone else brings the series back with new shows and the same characters...

I would highly recommend buying this series... You will watch it over and over again and be very happy with your purchase...
Thanks...
P.S. If the Production guys are reading this review, I have a question... Where is the release on Blueray?",1253404800,12,1316,4.485355648535565

3126872,3,B00149LMDU,"So I got the boxset in the mail and it looks super cool on the outside, but when you open it and pull the discs out, not so much. WB just packed in 10 discs without any artwork of any kind. All you get is an insert that states each disc and the titles for each episode. WB did such a great job for the Batman Animated DVD series that I thought that's what it'll look like inside, but no. I think WB did a rush job on the boxset because of the JL movie coming out and didn't put much effort into it. Anyway, glad all the episodes are there, but spending $50 for the collection, WB should've designed the boxset a little better for that price.",1509062400,2,641,4.015625

3126904,5,B00149LMDU,"As a major DC Comics fan I love this complete series box set. I love everything about it. The episode and disc quality, special features, the packaging and the price was fair. I bought this item 3 years ago back in 2012 and its still like brand new. The set contains 2 very strong thick plastic cases inside a metal box. All around very strong packaging. The first plastic case is labeled Justice League The Complete Series Volume One which includes Seasons 1 and 2 of the original series. It contains 8 discs. 4 discs from Season 1 and 4 discs from Season 2. The second plastic case is labeled Justice League The Complete Series Volume Two which includes Seasons 1 and 2 of the continuation of the original series titled Justice League Unlimited. It contains 7 discs. 4 discs from Season 1 and 2 discs for Season 2 with 1 bonus disc. All discs are single sided and NOT double sided. Each plastic case also contains an episode guide booklet with all episodes listed and with very awesome picture art. Both the metal box and first plastic case have a picture of Superman/Wonder Woman/Batman on front and on back it has a picture of Martian Manhunter/Hawkgirl/Green Lanten/The Flash. The second case has a picture of Red Tornado/Dr. Fate/Aquaman on front and on the back it has a picture of Green Arrow/The Atom/Green Lantern/Martian Manhunter. All characters are listed in order of how they appear on the case's pictures.

There are 14 discs,91 episodes, 2062 minutes of sheer fun for children of all ages and adults that have a fondness for animation. What I love most about have this set is that I get watch all the two part and three part story lines in one sitting. I don't need to tune the next week or the next day and of course there are no commercials.  This set brings out so many villains I couldn't keep track but the various combinations of superheroes always rose to the occasion.

3126935,5,B00149LMDU,"This series, like Batman: The Animated Series before it, sets the bar for animated superhero shows.

Initially, it's a two-episode-per-storyline series with a small but well-honed core cast, and then expands to show god knows how many more heroes from all over the world, each with unique personalities and abilities. The adventures run the gauntlet of alternate realities, body switching, showdowns with archenemies, stopping intergalactic despots, uncovering space police brutality, halting rogue secret experiments, and a good load more.

As is usual with DC, the animation and acting are top-shelf, and only enhances the incredible stories being told in this series. You really come to believe in these characters and what they're doing.

Bottom line, if you want a superhero show that delivers everything and more (including Batman singing), then you must own this series.",1415923200,,877,5.481481481481482

3126986,5,B00149LMDU,"The justice league animated series is great on its own. it has captivating stories, interesting and iconic characters, and great drawing/animation. In this complete series box set, its a no brainer for any die hard DC fan. The series comes packaged in two seperate plastic dvd cases, one containing eight dvds with both seasons of justice league, and the other containing six discs with both seasons of justice league : unlimited and a seventh disc with a featurette on the DC universe. those two dvd cases come in a large tin case that i personally found very cool. It is brightly colored on both sides. The picture of the back of the case having a description of the series, run time, ratings, and credits is actually deceiving; that is actually a paper insert that is covering the tin painted with the four justice leaguers that aren't on the front of the tin case. The tin case had a few very minor scratches in the paint, but it made it look more vintage. Also worth mentioning, everything was packaged in the correct order, and in the proper cases unlike previous reviews i read where the paper sleeves on the dvds came on the wrong case, i.e. justice league sleeve on justice league unlimited case. Also the dvds come out of their spots perfectly without feeling like they were stuck in there, but they did feel secure in the case; not like they would fall out easily. Overall, this is a great product, and i highly reccomend it.",1386460800,2,1436,4.61328125

Packaged with plenty of bonus features giving insight into everything DCAU, this is the ultimate collection. I only have 2 complaints. First, some of the episodes are out of order. Second, the tin collectors box was dented when I received it. Still, this DVD set provides hours and hours of fun I'm sure I will enjoy over and over.",1366416000,,752,4.792307692307692
3127109,3,B00149LMDU,"The package arrived on time (fairly quick) and was within a nice tin box.  There was no problem with Volume 1 & 2 being switched, as in previous reviews.  All the episodes appear to be Widescreen (at least, that's what the discs say on the edges).  The sleeve for the first set of discs was broken (most likely during packaging), but hopefully after the superglue dries that won't be a problem.

I was a bit disappointed in how many episodes were out of order.  The previous reviews made me believe there would only be two wrong, but this wasn't the case.  Here's what I found wrong...

1. Justice League Unlimited Season 3 is labeled Season 2.  Season's 1 & 2 are labeled Season 1 with a lot of discs.
2. Justice League was mostly correct, except Season 2, Disc 4 has ""Comfort & Joy"" wrong (3rd), which should be just after ""Wild Cards"" (5th).
3. Justice League Unlimited Season 1, Disc 1 is completely screwed up.

Disc 1 is...
Initiation, For the Man Who Has Everything, Hawk and Dove, Fearful Symmetry, Kid Stuff, This Little Piggy, The Return

Disc 1 should be...
Initiation, For the Man Who Has Everything, Kid Stuff, Hawk and Dove, This Little Piggy, Fearful Symmetry, The Greatest Story Never Told (is 1st on Disc 2), The Return (Belongs on Disc 2, after ""Greatest Story..."").

As mentioned in other reviews, Disc 4 has the 1st and 2nd episode reversed, which should be, ""Hunter's Moon"", then ""Question Authority"".  One may think that these episodes out-of-order don't really matter, but Justice League is touted as having an inner on-going plotline, involving a conspiracy (among others), that flows with the series.  Whether these specific episodes that are off will affect the storyline, I don't know, but just the same...  this problem shouldn't be difficult to fix in future creations (and should already be fixed, based on the time of other reviews).  I'm not sure I would've purchased it, knowing how many were out of order, but as is, it's not enough to bother with a return.  I'm particularly happy with the delivery time and the tin that it's in and look forward to watching them all in order.",1364947200,4,2111,4.695652173913044
3127110,4,B00149LMDU,"First of all, let me just say that the Justice League animated series is AWESOME!!!! Lots of action, mixed in with some humor and just a touch of romance (for good measure) makes for a dynamic cartoon. Now on to the product itself. It is 15 DVDs that comes in 2 volumes, which are in plastic containers that are housed in a metal container and then wrapped in plastic (if it's brand new, like mine was). The containers are sturdy and the DVDs are not hard to take out. There are just a couple minor things that I didn't like about the product overall (and these could be considered as personal gripes). First, after Season 1 of Justice League (which is in fullscreen format), the series is represented in widescreen. I hate widescreen. I don't have a widescreen TV and those black bars annoy me. Second, several of the episodes are out of viewing order. It's not so bad except for in Season 1 of Justice League Unlimited, where the episodes ""Hunter's Moon"" and ""Question Authority"" are out of order. At the end of ""Question Authority"", Captain Atom and Superman are about to throw down, which leads directly into the episode ""Flashpoint."" But between the two episodes is ""Hunter's Moon"", which is supposed to be before ""Question Authority."" The booklet that comes with the volume has the episodes listed in the right order, but when you go to play them, you see that they are out of order. And last but not least, if you've ever read any of the comics that contain characters in Justice League and then watched the show, you'd see that the cartoon League is nowhere near as powerful as the comics version. Superman and Wonder Woman get hurt easier and more often, Green Lantern is not very creative with his ring, Flash doesn't run nearly as fast (he has trouble keeping up with cars, for crying out loud!), and all Batman does most of the time is jump around and throw an assortment of batarangs. Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl are the only ones who seem to live up to their comic versions. But other'n all that, a great series overall. I highly recommend it!",1363564800,2,2060,4.585365853658536

3127112,5,B00149LMDU,"Great animated series that got even better as it developed.  The animation was good but the writing and voice acting were great.

The writing and character development on the series were superb.  Instead of centering on the superstars of the DC universe lower-profile characters were allowed to develop in interesting and effective ways.  Many episodes of Justice League Unlimited focused on minor characters like Green Arrow, The Huntress, and especially The Question (who made Batman look well-adjusted).  There were personality and agenda conficts between both heroes and villains - not everybody got along, and occasinally even the original seven made bad decisions.  It all worked very well.

This collection should appeal to both adults and older kids if they like the Justice League.  The cartoon violence is mild and characters rarely die.  Adults have plenty of easter eggs to watch for including references to characters of the Silver and Golden ages.  A particularly interesting choice was the inclulsion of the Golden Age Hawkman instead of the Silver Age version and his complex relationship with the Silver Age Hawkgirl.  This collection will probably not be of interest to the very young.

Probably the best animated TV series to date.",1362528000,,1250,5.257575757575758

Here is the entire Justice League and Justice League Unlimited series, with the excellent voice acting, plots and action that hard core comic book fans would demand and that any can appreciate.

The main characters are Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern (John Stewart), and Hawkgirl. With this line up the show had more diversity and I think it worked really well for the characters. The first season does a great job of setting up the show and the format of the series. The first two seasons had three part episodes that created one story. There are some growing pains in the first season, but it still was a great season. Season 2 takes the show even further with bigger threats and more continuity. The last three seasons the show became Justice League Unlimited. The show switched to a single episode format and greatly expanded the roster of the Justice League. This might all sound like a bit much, but they created an over arching season with the Cadmus story line. Season 3 and 4 focuses on the Cadmus story, while The final season uses the Legion of Doom.

I never got a chance to watch that many of the episodes when they aired so I was just as excited (read MORE) as my son to sit down and watch these. We usually grab a box set to watch when we travel for hours (vehicle system +++), and this set is one of the better ones. We haven't made it through all of the discs yet but they are great so far.

As stated by others, the Actual Physical Box Set sucks.  I think it was designed by a 5th grader as the little plastic spines that hold the DvDs just flat out doesn't work.  However, its a minor point.

Its a great bargain, basically you end up paying less than $1 per episode so that is great value.

But the problem I did have with the packaging was the metal tin that the cases came in. It may have been damaged during shipping but I had to pry it open, thus ruining it, in order to get the cases containing the DVDs out. The art on it is great but something made it just about impossible to get the cases out.

Otherwise it is a great series at a great price.

*edit* Getting to the last disk of the first season of JLU shows that the episodes on that disk are out of order.

3127231,5,B00149LMDU,"One of the most epic and groundbreaking shows...with some of the most disappointing moments.

Season 1 of Justice League was clearly a warm up. Some good moments and interesting plots. Not being the world's biggest fan of over the top sci-fi (a city of gorillas for instance) they actually added enough drama to keep me interested. Cliched dialogue is laced throughout but character dynamics are starting to hatch. Luthor gets together a team of super baddies that actually feels motivated by more than just ""We shall rule the world! Bwahahahaha!""

Season 2 was when things really picked up. The wide-screen format makes for a more mature presentation (somehow those magic bars make things look more professional) and the emotion of these characters takes center stage over the sci-fi gimmicks that would be ridiculous without any grounding. More adult themes and innuendos are slipped in particularly with Green Lantern and Hawkgirl's relationship (it shouldn't work...but it does somehow!). Sadly, one of the few duds in this batch is the episode with the Joker and the Royal Flush Gang, which is the most lackluster Joker since the nightmare that was ""Christmas with the Joker"" in Batman TAS. Brainiac and Darkseid make appearances in an awesome story. Oh yeah and the Justice Lords rock! The three part season finale, Starcrossed, could have been a typical alien invasion story but betrayal, police state themes, and ultimately the expulsion of a Justice League memeber (who is it?..I won't say...even though Bruce Timm gave it away on the special features of Season 1...the jerk) make for an epic story that would have been the perfect ending to the show.

BUT there was more. Justice League Unlimited changed the format to keep the show from getting stale. While sometimes convoluted and rushed, the one part episodes make for quicker stories that can introduce new characters for the sake of one story then discard them to background roles for the rest of the show (Hawk and Dove, anyone?). The characters that do survive more than one story (Green Arrow, Black Canary, THE QUESTION!) are deservedly given bigger roles in the Cadmus story arc that combines shadow government themes with whodunnit suspense. While not as engaging as JL season 2, the new Cadmus story arc proves that this show can still far surpass most action shows aimed at kids.

Then there was JLU Season 2. The creators thought they were going to be finished with the show and put all their creative energies into Cadmus. Then Cartoon Network asked for one more season from producers who thought they were done...it shows! Season 2 has the feeling of a VERY disappointing sequel. The only episodes worth bothering with are The Great Brain Robbery (Flash and Luthor swap brains...comic gold!) and the last two episodes of the series (even then they have their lousy moments).

So in closing, there's enough great material here to merit buying the complete set BUT if I were you I would wait until you can find one for cheaper than what they're asking as I write this. I got it new for the cheapest I could find on the web (I won't tell you exactly how much...but it rhymes with ""pixty-five"") and that was probably about fair. I'm just saying it's not SO amazing that you can't wait for a better price.",1305590400,18,3277,4.886690647482014

(not that there's anything wrong with having a 15th disc, its just not worth going nuts over it).

3127288,5,B00149LMDU,"There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews. This is simply a great series. Whether you enjoy the (usually two-parter) episodes of Justice league or more partial to the single part episodes and incredibly well done overarching storyline for the Justice league Unlimited seasons, you won't be disappointed. I bought all the seasons separately, before they were in one pack like this. I think I paid more money for it at the time, but it was easily worth it. I watch these a lot of times.

The series starts out with Superman helping some lefty try to disarm the entire world to foster peace. It turns out the politician is release an alien trying to weaken the earth so as people have an easier time conquering us. Superman realizes he's been tricked, but it's too late and they're too powerful for him. As things progress, he teams up with a bunch of other superheroes and after the conflict is over they decide to form the Justice league. After that the series is basically their adventures helping to keep the earth save from super villains. At the end of the second season, up the trail ends in the destruction of the league... Or does it?

Of course no it does not. Instead the league is expanded to include dozens of superheroes. What really impressed me about the unlimited series, was the extremely involved overarching plot. Each episode actually meant something, and progressed to a logical conclusion. It's probably the most detailed plot I've ever seen in a cartoon series. The second season isn't quite as good, seeming like they change direction a little bit part way through, but when villain turns against villain in one of the later episodes things become simply unbelievable!  It may not be for the little kiddies, because characters do die... Permanently. I won't spoil who, but these are not bit characters!  I have never seen that in a cartoon series before. I think they knew the series (and the entire universe since the 1990s Batman cartoon) was about to end and they wanted to go all out. If you have to only by part of the series, the two seasons of unlimited blew my mind.

If you like looking at cartoon women, you won't be disappointed either. Animation is good and the female characters looked darn good. Perverted or not, I usually like to know that before buying a series. ;-)",1292630400,3,2330,4.659367396593674

The plots from those past series as well as new plots for the characters like Flash and Wonder Woman are added making this one of the ultimate works ever produced by Warner Brothers Animation.

If you want action, great story line, and character development it is all in here. I would only recommend this to those that have not purchased any of the seasons to Justice League though since disks are the same as the season releases (apart from the bonus disk). That's why this product was perfect for me.",1291766400,,645,4.657894736842105

3127291,3,B00149LMDU,"This set comes with all episodes of JL and JLU clocking in at 90 episodes.  For $60, it is less than a dollar per episode, which to me is a good deal.  There are a couple of things that hold this set back from being a must buy.  First, as other have mentioned, the volume 1 discs are in the volume 2 box and vice versa.  Nevertheless, it can be remedied by switching the ""pages"" which hold the DVDs.  My issue is there are 2 plastic things that hold the dvd pages together and to the spine of the box.  One of these plastic things was missing and since it didn't appear in the box, I thought it was broken but sealed up anyways.

  Second, the second season of JL is presented in matted widescreen format.  This means that the black bars appear at the top and bottom but the 4:3 aspect ratio is kept.  On a 4:3 TV, this is fine.  On a 16:9 TV, which I believe are all HDTVs, it is a bit distracting.  Although, I suspect that with a good upscaling dvd/blu-ray player, this point might be moot.

  Third and lastly, which annoyed me, there are two episodes that are switched on JLU season 1 disc 4.  The episodes are Hunter's Moon and Question Authority.  Chronologically, Hunter's Moon comes before Question Authority.  Even in the booklet that it comes with lists Hunter's Moon first.  When it is played, Question Authority comes before Hunter's Moon.  Normally this would not be a problem, since most JLU episodes are stand alone versus the 2 episode format of JL.  !!!SPOILER ALERT!!! However, Question Authority is the first episode in the CADMUS/Brainiac arc.  So at the end of this episode, when Superman and Capt. Atom are about to fight, it ""cuts away"" to Hunter's Moon!  I was surprised and perplexed.  I don't know if I got a bad print run or what, but this was the reason that prompted the review.

  Nevertheless, this is still a good deal.  As mentioned before, a dollar per episode is my threshold to buy animated box sets, american or japanese.  The issues outlined above might be enough to dissuade someone to wait for the inevitable limited edition and/or blu-ray print runs.  For me, it wasn't enough to return it.  There are still 3 discs left to view, both discs of JLU season 2 and JL season 2 disc 2.  This review will be updated if those discs have anymore surprises.

The series is perhaps the best DC universe series ever created; the drawing is incredible, and the story lines are beyond comparison (season 2, 3 part finale ""Starcrossed."")

The special features in the first two seasons were far better than the second two seasons, however, that quality of animation in both are grand.

Even includes the Starcrossed movie that occurs between season 2 and season 3.

3127399,5,B00149LMDU,"I am someone who has come very late to the party, only seeing several Justice League stories a year or 2 ago. I have always been a huge fan of Batman the Animated Series, but not so much the Superman one.
That being said I must say that The Justice League Complete Collection was an exceptional watch, covering stories from the initial forming of the Justice League, to stories that involved time travel, and all the unique powers and skills each of the heroes bring to this well crafted cartoon.

Personally I enjoyed the original 2 seasons of Justice League over the Justice League Unlimited seasons as they have fewer heroes, making for more personal and involving stories. My favorite story was one involving The Justice Lords.

If you have ever enjoyed Batman or Superman Animated Series, Justice League Complete Collection is well worth it.

Thank you Bruce Timm & Co for yet again bringing another batch of great storytelling and action to a Saturday morning cartoon",1265155200,,973,4.81437125748503
3127400,5,B00149LMDU,"I think this is the greatest superhero show ever, even though it is animated, I feel the stories & charcterizations are bang-on for the characters used.
The program is centered on violence...but there are numerous occasions where the catalyst characters show plenty of compassion & compromise.",1264982400,,293,5.391304347826087
3127401,5,B00149LMDU,"I'd only actually seen one episode of the Justice League show before I bought this set, and it was one I'd downloaded online. I'd been a huge fan of the Batman Animated Series growing up, so this show intrigued me. I read all I could about it - reviews, quotes, stuff like that - to make sure it was for me, before I finally made the plunge and purchased this boxed set. It was SO WORTH IT. If you enjoyed Batman, or even the Superman Animated Series, this show will not disappoint.

The actual set comes in a metal box with two plastic DVD cases inside. The cases have ""pages"", with a DVD stuck on the front and the back. My only complaint about these ""pages"" is that the DVDs are a little tricky to get off, as they like to stick and it's hard to get them off without a significant amount of pulling and bending of the page itself. I worried about breaking them at first because the initial disks were really stubbornly attached. However, it just takes a little practice to find the right method, and then the rest of the disks pop right off. Don't let this dissuade you from a purchase.

The box arrived promptly, on Christmas Week no less, and not a disk was out of place. The only thing wrong was the Volume One and Volume Two covers and booklets were in the wrong books. It was a small matter to switch them around, and then everything was perfect.

I am VERY satisfied with this product.",1263686400,,1394,4.2927756653992395

In this particular package, Vol. 1 contains seasons One and Two of ""Justice League Unlimited,"" and Vol. 2 contains seasons One and Two of ""Justice League.""  The events of ""Justice League"" take place BEFORE the events of ""Justice League Unlimited,"" but the two volumes are numbered in the opposite order.  If you've seen the series before, it doesn't make a particular difference, however, if you are viewing the series for the first time, make sure to watch Vol. 2 first to keep from having plot points spoiled.",1263254400,125,642,4.8090909090909095

3127444,5,B00149LMDU,"I'm so happy I  bought the Justice League: The Complete Series.  The set comes in a nice metal case, with 2 cases, containing the many DVDs. I wasn't into animated cartoons a few years ago, so there goes why I didn't bother watching this series. But, after getting clips sent to me via Youtube by a friend, I was instantly hooked. I was about to buy season 1 on DVD, but opted to wait until the complete series was released a few weeks later, because of the great value price of 67.99, can't beat that price! All 4 seasons were great, but my favorite 2 seasons were Justice League Unlimited season 1 and 2. I liked the usage of the many DC characters in those 2 seasons. Huntress, Green Arrow, Super Girl, Booster Gold, and Black Canary are my favorite characters, outside the original 7. This series wouldn't be complete without seeing villains such as Joker, Lex Luthor, Grodd, and Darkseid, which you see a quite a few times. I highly recommend JL: The Complete Set to anyone who already loves the DC Universe or for someone who is looking for a good, high action, well directed and written, animated series to dive into. A huge thank you to Bruce Timm and his team for making this great animated show[ among his other gem projects such as Batman: The Animated Series, Superman animated series and Batman Beyond]. The theme song from JLU seasons 1 and 2 was so well done, that now it's in my Ipod!

The extras dvd is not a big deal at all, it's just the extra stuff put on that one dvd instead of spreading it out through the dvd's like it originally was plus ur added bonus content which is not a big deal. Still i prefer getting everything in ONE SHOT over buying it separately having messes and taking up space. Great buy although for me a little too pricey as i could have gotten all the original series boxsets cheaper.",1259798400,2,607,4.28695652173913

My 5yr. old son is getting this for Christmas & he is going to be thrilled,  bet his eyes light up ! the quality of the animation is great, it doesn't look dated .  This is better than lots of the primetime programs ... I am more than pleased with the purchase.  I like the fact that it teaches values & helping others & that no matter how big a challenge,  there is an answer .

3127449,5,B00149LMDU,"Join Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl for the ultimate superhero adventure. If you thought Batman: The Animated Series or The New Batman/Superman Adventures was good, then you haven't seen anything until you've checked out Justice League. It's difficult to explain just how awesome this series is in words. Probably the best way to sum it up is this: Justice League is the best superhero show ever.

Instead of leaning on cheesy one-liners and adolescent sidekicks who hang around just to teach viewers life lessons, Justice League cuts to the meat of storytelling with imaginative plotlines ranging from alien attacks to government conspiracies and realistic adult characters who mature both as a crime-fighting team and as friends as the series progresses. Instead of being a group of chummy friends, the heroes of Justice League don't always agree with one another, sometimes have trouble working with one another, and periodically leave and re-enter the plot -- each time with evidence that something happened to them in the interim.

In the beginning, the Man of Steel himself becomes a symbol for world peace, only to find out in an alien invasion that he can't save the world by himself. He enlists (well, as much as you can enlist) Batman and frees The Martian Manhunter, who then recruits newcomer Wonder Woman, an Amazon Princess named Diana, a wise-cracking Wally West, also known as The Flash, the militant Green Lantern, John Stewart, and the hot-headed, intelligent alien Shiera, also known as Hawkgirl.

Justice League: The Complete Series consists of 14 discs containing 91 episodes from both the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated TV series, plus a bonus 15th disc that includes a great feature with the creators of the series reflecting on the Justice League, the DC Animated Universe, the show's Super Friends origins, and how this series has changed the face of the superhero TV show. Other bonus features scattered throughout the collection include director's commentary on select episodes, behind the scenes features, and trailers for upcoming DC animated universe features.

This collection brings together every Justice League episode into a wonderful collector's edition in a sturdy tin with gorgeous character artwork. Inside the tin all of the discs are separated into two volumes, one with Justice League and the other with Justice League Unlimited. Both volumes have spectacular character cover art.

This series is perfect for die-hard fans or fans who have not yet purchased any of the previous Justice League DVDs. However, if you've already bought the DVDs, then Justice League: The Complete Series doesn't offer anything new beyond the bonus disc's short feature. In fact, it looks like WB just took the previous releases and smashed them all together and didn't even bother to change the artwork on the discs, booklets or the content of the discs themselves. Aside from the compilation and collector's aspect of the collection, it feels like WB got a little lazy and thought they could cash in on this franchise one more time. Despite that, Justice League is still the best superhero show ever made, and this is the best collection of Justice League out there.",1258761600,6,3266,5.178030303030303

3127451,5,B00149LMDU,"Just got this set today and I haven't had time to watch any of it yet.  When I opened the box from Amazon, I was surprised at the packaging.  I didn't know, or at least didn't remember, that it would be in a metal case, which was a great bonus.  Then I took the two 'books' out of the case to flip through the DVDs and I got a little perplexed.  The Volume 1 DVDs were in the Volume 2 Book and vice versa.  Odd, I thought.  So, I decided to 'fix' the problem by switching the DVDs out one by one, which I thought was a great idea until I realized there are more discs in the second book.  So, I had to switch the DVDs back to their original book and switch the cover and booklets instead.  Not a big problem and nothing worth complaining about, just thought I'd save anyone else with the same trouble the hassle of mistakenly trying to switch the discs.  Now that that's solved, I can start watching Justice League!",1257811200,13,915,4.124293785310734
3127452,5,B00149LMDU,"I don't think I'll buy this as I have all the previously released season sets. Aside from that, this show is extremely good. In many ways it culminates several plotlines from the original Batman/Superman shows, Batman Beyond, and even a reference to the Static Shock show from when he had to stop a posessed John Stewart.

3361322,5,B00149LMDU,"I grew up on Super Friends and the orginal JLA, but it was geared toward me and my current age at that time. This series hooked myself and my 3 year old. Which says alot for the story writing and character highlights per episode. very complex story arcs give it the feel of prime time shows, without all the tired wit. It's made for kids, plain and simple, but this series does it right with such a range, you not only enjoy the show, it's not a guilty pleasure.  The animation really hasn't dated itself either. They stayed on the cutting edge of the day to give this series a more lasting look. Some of the 3D sequences are slightly aged, but easily over looked. Pit against Superman or Batman: the animated series, this is easily the best one. Each is good in it's right, but if i could choose one, this is it. Not only do you get the same amazing voice talent (Batman), the stories are so rich and varied, you find yourself never bored with the series.",1254096000,18,956,4.311111111111111

Also available on the 4-disc JL Season Two set released on June 20, 2006 which oddly featured all 26 episodes (multi-part arcs) in non-Anamorphic Widescreen; plus special features.

6 episodes from the first half of Justice League Unlimted Season One were originally released separately on the single-disc volumes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-the-World/dp/B0006U3SJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving the World</a>&nbsp;(February 15, 2005) and ""Joining Forces"" (September 20, 2005). Also available on the 4-disc Anamorphic Widescreen JLU Season One set released on October 24, 2006 which (despite the ""Season One"" box title) actually contains both JLU Seasons One and Two (each 13 episodes) featuring extras covering only the first half of the 2 in 1 season set with the following season set to include the missing bonus material.

The final 13 episodes of Justice League Unlimited were only released on the 2-disc Anamorphic Widescreen JLU Season Two set released on March 20, 2007 featuring the extra sorely missed from the previous set, ""Cadmus: Exposed"" which resolved the discussion on the popular series story arc; plus other bonus material.

For the Complete Series release, Warner Home Video has lovingly repackaged from the separate season sets all 91 episodes and respective special features (in respective aspect ratios) on 15 single-sided DVDs (including a brand new bonus disc) all in an exclusive collectible box set that does justice to DCAU's League of Extraordinary Superheroes.

Special Features include:
New Bonus Disc Documentary ""Unlimited Reserve: Exploring the Depths of the DC Universe"".

Commentary on 8 episodes with Series Creators: ""The Enemy Below Part 2"", ""Legends Part 2"", ""The Savage Time Part 2"", ""Twilight Part 2"", ""A Better World Part 2"", ""Starcrossed Part 3"", ""This Little Piggy"", ""The Return"".

Featurettes: ""Inside Justice League"", ""The Look of The League"", ""The Blueprint for Justice"", ""Justice League - The First Mission"", ""Voices of Justice"", ""Justice League: Declassified"", ""And Justice for all"", ""Themes of Justice"", ""Cadmus: Exposed"", ""Justice League Chronicles"", Music-only audio track for the final episode ""Destroyer"".

Easter Egg: ""Not too Savage"", a Deleted Scene with an introduction by producer Bruce Timm.

Packaging:
Two large and sturdy digipaks - one for ""Justice League"" featuring Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman cover art identical to the outer case, and one for ""Justice League Unlimited"" featuring Red Tornado, Dr. Fate and Aquaman cover art - inside an outer case.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended, especially for fans who don't own any of the previous season set releases. To fans that already own the previous releases, just know that aside from the bonus disc documentary (and the convenience of complete series packaging) all of the disc content are the same as the previous releases before you decide.",1254009600,269,5185,7.440456769983687

3361325,5,B00149LMDU,"Ok...
First off, I do not have this particular series collection yet, because it hasn't been released yet.
With the above being said, I can say that I own all of the individual justice league seasons, and they were all incredible, so this set should be at least as good...

This series is Simply one of the best ever...

The wide array of past & new hero's and villians is Great...
The storyline's are Awesome...

You don't see the same characters on every show, you get a great variety...

My daughter watches the shows with me, as it is very suitable for kids of any age, but the writing is so darn good that it really appeals to the adult audience as well...
I remember one of the episodes with SuperGirl(my favorite super hero) where she actually says she was just copping a feel to a male character on the show...
I just think that writing ROCKS!!!!

My only complaint is that the series ended and didn't go longer... I do not understand how a series that good stopped...
I hope Mr. Timm or someone else brings the series back with new shows and the same characters...

I would highly recommend buying this series... You will watch it over and over again and be very happy with your purchase...
Thanks...

WB just packed in 10 discs without any artwork of any kind. All you get is an insert that states each disc and the titles for each episode. WB did such a great job for the Batman Animated DVD series that I thought that's what it'll look like inside, but no. I think WB did a rush job on the boxset because of the JL movie coming out and didn't put much effort into it.

I bought this item 3 years ago back in 2012 and its still like brand new. The set contains 2 very strong thick plastic cases inside a metal box. All around very strong packaging. The first plastic case is labeled Justice League The Complete Series Volume One which includes Seasons 1 and 2 of the original series. It contains 8 discs. 4 discs from Season 1 and 4 discs from Season 2. The second plastic case is labeled Justice League The Complete Series Volume Two which includes Seasons 1 and 2 of the continuation of the original series titled Justice League Unlimited. It contains 7 discs. 4 discs from Season 1 and 2 discs for Season 2 with 1 bonus disc. All discs are single sided and NOT double sided. Each plastic case also contains an episode guide booklet with all episodes listed and with very awesome picture art.

3361432,5,B00149LMDU,"This series, like Batman: The Animated Series before it, sets the bar for animated superhero shows.

Initially, it's a two-episode-per-storyline series with a small but well-honed core cast, and then expands to show god knows how many more heroes from all over the world, each with unique personalities and abilities. The adventures run the gauntlet of alternate realities, body switching, showdowns with archenemies, stopping intergalactic despots, uncovering space police brutality, halting rogue secret experiments, and a good load more.

As is usual with DC, the animation and acting are top-shelf, and only enhances the incredible stories being told in this series. You really come to believe in these characters and what they're doing.

3361483,5,B00149LMDU,"The justice league animated series is great on its own. it has captivating stories, interesting and iconic characters, and great drawing/animation. In this complete series box set, its a no brainer for any die hard DC fan. The series comes packaged in two seperate plastic dvd cases, one containing eight dvds with both seasons of justice league, and the other containing six discs with both seasons of justice league : unlimited and a seventh disc with a featurette on the DC universe. those two dvd cases come in a large tin case that i personally found very cool. It is brightly colored on both sides. The picture of the back of the case having a description of the series, run time, ratings, and credits is actually deceiving; that is actually a paper insert that is covering the tin painted with the four justice leaguers that aren't on the front of the tin case. The tin case had a few very minor scratches in the paint, but it made it look more vintage. Also worth mentioning, everything was packaged in the correct order, and in the proper cases unlike previous reviews i read where the paper sleeves on the dvds came on the wrong case, i.e. justice league sleeve on justice league unlimited case. Also the dvds come out of their spots perfectly without feeling like they were stuck in there, but they did feel secure in the case; not like they would fall out easily. Overall, this is a great product, and i highly reccomend it.",1386460800,2,1436,4.61328125

3361606,3,B00149LMDU,"The package arrived on time (fairly quick) and was within a nice tin box.  There was no problem with Volume 1 & 2 being switched, as in previous reviews.  All the episodes appear to be Widescreen (at least, that's what the discs say on the edges).  The sleeve for the first set of discs was broken (most likely during packaging), but hopefully after the superglue dries that won't be a problem.

I was a bit disappointed in how many episodes were out of order.  The previous reviews made me believe there would only be two wrong, but this wasn't the case.  Here's what I found wrong...

1. Justice League Unlimited Season 3 is labeled Season 2.  Season's 1 & 2 are labeled Season 1 with a lot of discs.
2. Justice League was mostly correct, except Season 2, Disc 4 has ""Comfort & Joy"" wrong (3rd), which should be just after ""Wild Cards"" (5th).
3. Justice League Unlimited Season 1, Disc 1 is completely screwed up.

Disc 1 is...
Initiation, For the Man Who Has Everything, Hawk and Dove, Fearful Symmetry, Kid Stuff, This Little Piggy, The Return

Disc 1 should be...
Initiation, For the Man Who Has Everything, Kid Stuff, Hawk and Dove, This Little Piggy, Fearful Symmetry, The Greatest Story Never Told (is 1st on Disc 2), The Return (Belongs on Disc 2, after ""Greatest Story..."").

As mentioned in other reviews, Disc 4 has the 1st and 2nd episode reversed, which should be, ""Hunter's Moon"", then ""Question Authority"".  One may think that these episodes out-of-order don't really matter, but Justice League is touted as having an inner on-going plotline, involving a conspiracy (among others), that flows with the series.  Whether these specific episodes that are off will affect the storyline, I don't know, but just the same...  this problem shouldn't be difficult to fix in future creations (and should already be fixed, based on the time of other reviews).  I'm not sure I would've purchased it, knowing how many were out of order, but as is, it's not enough to bother with a return.  I'm particularly happy with the delivery time and the tin that it's in and look forward to watching them all in order.",1364947200,4,2111,4.695652173913044

The containers are sturdy and the DVDs are not hard to take out. There are just a couple minor things that I didn't like about the product overall (and these could be considered as personal gripes). First, after Season 1 of Justice League (which is in fullscreen format), the series is represented in widescreen. I hate widescreen. I don't have a widescreen TV and those black bars annoy me. Second, several of the episodes are out of viewing order. It's not so bad except for in Season 1 of Justice League Unlimited, where the episodes ""Hunter's Moon"" and ""Question Authority"" are out of order. At the end of ""Question Authority"", Captain Atom and Superman are about to throw down, which leads directly into the episode ""Flashpoint."" But between the two episodes is ""Hunter's Moon"", which is supposed to be before ""Question Authority."" The booklet that comes with the volume has the episodes listed in the right order, but when you go to play them, you see that they are out of order. And last but not least, if you've ever read any of the comics that contain characters in Justice League and then watched the show, you'd see that the cartoon League is nowhere near as powerful as the comics version. Superman and Wonder Woman get hurt easier and more often, Green Lantern is not very creative with his ring, Flash doesn't run nearly as fast (he has trouble keeping up with cars, for crying out loud!), and all Batman does most of the time is jump around and throw an assortment of batarangs. Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl are the only ones who seem to live up to their comic versions. But other'n all that, a great series overall. I highly recommend it!",1363564800,2,2060,4.585365853658536
3361608,5,B00149LMDU,"This is a fun show that has comedy, action and adventure and provides some great personalities in the league members such as batman and flash being my favorites.

3361609,5,B00149LMDU,"Great animated series that got even better as it developed.  The animation was good but the writing and voice acting were great.

The writing and character development on the series were superb.  Instead of centering on the superstars of the DC universe lower-profile characters were allowed to develop in interesting and effective ways.  Many episodes of Justice League Unlimited focused on minor characters like Green Arrow, The Huntress, and especially The Question (who made Batman look well-adjusted).  There were personality and agenda conficts between both heroes and villains - not everybody got along, and occasinally even the original seven made bad decisions.  It all worked very well.

This collection should appeal to both adults and older kids if they like the Justice League.  The cartoon violence is mild and characters rarely die.  Adults have plenty of easter eggs to watch for including references to characters of the Silver and Golden ages.  A particularly interesting choice was the inclulsion of the Golden Age Hawkman instead of the Silver Age version and his complex relationship with the Silver Age Hawkgirl.  This collection will probably not be of interest to the very young.

Probably the best animated TV series to date.",1362528000,,1250,5.257575757575758

The main characters are Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern (John Stewart), and Hawkgirl. With this line up the show had more diversity and I think it worked really well for the characters. The first season does a great job of setting up the show and the format of the series. The first two seasons had three part episodes that created one story. There are some growing pains in the first season, but it still was a great season. Season 2 takes the show even further with bigger threats and more continuity. The last three seasons the show became Justice League Unlimited. The show switched to a single episode format and greatly expanded the roster of the Justice League. This might all sound like a bit much, but they created an over arching season with the Cadmus story line. Season 3 and 4 focuses on the Cadmus story, while The final season uses the Legion of Doom.

3361728,5,B00149LMDU,"One of the most epic and groundbreaking shows...with some of the most disappointing moments.

Season 1 of Justice League was clearly a warm up. Some good moments and interesting plots. Not being the world's biggest fan of over the top sci-fi (a city of gorillas for instance) they actually added enough drama to keep me interested. Cliched dialogue is laced throughout but character dynamics are starting to hatch. Luthor gets together a team of super baddies that actually feels motivated by more than just ""We shall rule the world! Bwahahahaha!""

Season 2 was when things really picked up. The wide-screen format makes for a more mature presentation (somehow those magic bars make things look more professional) and the emotion of these characters takes center stage over the sci-fi gimmicks that would be ridiculous without any grounding. More adult themes and innuendos are slipped in particularly with Green Lantern and Hawkgirl's relationship (it shouldn't work...but it does somehow!). Sadly, one of the few duds in this batch is the episode with the Joker and the Royal Flush Gang, which is the most lackluster Joker since the nightmare that was ""Christmas with the Joker"" in Batman TAS. Brainiac and Darkseid make appearances in an awesome story. Oh yeah and the Justice Lords rock! The three part season finale, Starcrossed, could have been a typical alien invasion story but betrayal, police state themes, and ultimately the expulsion of a Justice League memeber (who is it?..I won't say...even though Bruce Timm gave it away on the special features of Season 1...the jerk) make for an epic story that would have been the perfect ending to the show.

BUT there was more. Justice League Unlimited changed the format to keep the show from getting stale. While sometimes convoluted and rushed, the one part episodes make for quicker stories that can introduce new characters for the sake of one story then discard them to background roles for the rest of the show (Hawk and Dove, anyone?). The characters that do survive more than one story (Green Arrow, Black Canary, THE QUESTION!) are deservedly given bigger roles in the Cadmus story arc that combines shadow government themes with whodunnit suspense. While not as engaging as JL season 2, the new Cadmus story arc proves that this show can still far surpass most action shows aimed at kids.

Then there was JLU Season 2. The creators thought they were going to be finished with the show and put all their creative energies into Cadmus. Then Cartoon Network asked for one more season from producers who thought they were done...it shows! Season 2 has the feeling of a VERY disappointing sequel. The only episodes worth bothering with are The Great Brain Robbery (Flash and Luthor swap brains...comic gold!) and the last two episodes of the series (even then they have their lousy moments).

So in closing, there's enough great material here to merit buying the complete set BUT if I were you I would wait until you can find one for cheaper than what they're asking as I write this. I got it new for the cheapest I could find on the web (I won't tell you exactly how much...but it rhymes with ""pixty-five"") and that was probably about fair. I'm just saying it's not SO amazing that you can't wait for a better price.",1305590400,18,3277,4.886690647482014

3361784,1,B00149LMDU,this series can not possible get any worse then it all ready is. they should never and i do stress never i boy do i stress never should have put batman or superman in this pathic series. They should have just put the five of the others dc comics chracators in this show if they had done that then this series would have been much better. trust me stick with the batman and superman animated series at least those shows do justice to the two most beloved charactors in the dc universe.,1292976000,5,484,4.271739130434782
3361785,5,B00149LMDU,"There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews. This is simply a great series. Whether you enjoy the (usually two-parter) episodes of Justice league or more partial to the single part episodes and incredibly well done overarching storyline for the Justice league Unlimited seasons, you won't be disappointed. I bought all the seasons separately, before they were in one pack like this. I think I paid more money for it at the time, but it was easily worth it. I watch these a lot of times.

The series starts out with Superman helping some lefty try to disarm the entire world to foster peace. It turns out the politician is release an alien trying to weaken the earth so as people have an easier time conquering us. Superman realizes he's been tricked, but it's too late and they're too powerful for him. As things progress, he teams up with a bunch of other superheroes and after the conflict is over they decide to form the Justice league. After that the series is basically their adventures helping to keep the earth save from super villains. At the end of the second season, up the trail ends in the destruction of the league... Or does it?

Of course no it does not. Instead the league is expanded to include dozens of superheroes. What really impressed me about the unlimited series, was the extremely involved overarching plot. Each episode actually meant something, and progressed to a logical conclusion. It's probably the most detailed plot I've ever seen in a cartoon series. The second season isn't quite as good, seeming like they change direction a little bit part way through, but when villain turns against villain in one of the later episodes things become simply unbelievable!  It may not be for the little kiddies, because characters do die... Permanently. I won't spoil who, but these are not bit characters!  I have never seen that in a cartoon series before. I think they knew the series (and the entire universe since the 1990s Batman cartoon) was about to end and they wanted to go all out. If you have to only by part of the series, the two seasons of unlimited blew my mind.

If you like looking at cartoon women, you won't be disappointed either. Animation is good and the female characters looked darn good. Perverted or not, I usually like to know that before buying a series. ;-)",1292630400,3,2330,4.659367396593674
3361786,5,B00149LMDU,"If you're a fan of Batman: the Animated Series, Superman: the Animated Series and even Batman Beyond then this is definitely worth your money. The plots from those past series as well as new plots for the characters like Flash and Wonder Woman are added making this one of the ultimate works ever produced by Warner Brothers Animation.

If you want action, great story line, and character development it is all in here. I would only recommend this to those that have not purchased any of the seasons to Justice League though since disks are the same as the season releases (apart from the bonus disk). That's why this product was perfect for me.",1291766400,,645,4.657894736842105

It comes in a cool tin box and like advertised, has all the episodes. if you're a fan of this cartoon (which I wish they did not cancel) then this is everything you'll ever need.",1291507200,,283,4.3584905660377355
3361788,3,B00149LMDU,"This set comes with all episodes of JL and JLU clocking in at 90 episodes.  For $60, it is less than a dollar per episode, which to me is a good deal.  There are a couple of things that hold this set back from being a must buy.  First, as other have mentioned, the volume 1 discs are in the volume 2 box and vice versa.  Nevertheless, it can be remedied by switching the ""pages"" which hold the DVDs.  My issue is there are 2 plastic things that hold the dvd pages together and to the spine of the box.  One of these plastic things was missing and since it didn't appear in the box, I thought it was broken but sealed up anyways.

  Second, the second season of JL is presented in matted widescreen format.  This means that the black bars appear at the top and bottom but the 4:3 aspect ratio is kept.  On a 4:3 TV, this is fine.  On a 16:9 TV, which I believe are all HDTVs, it is a bit distracting.  Although, I suspect that with a good upscaling dvd/blu-ray player, this point might be moot.

  Third and lastly, which annoyed me, there are two episodes that are switched on JLU season 1 disc 4.  The episodes are Hunter's Moon and Question Authority.  Chronologically, Hunter's Moon comes before Question Authority.  Even in the booklet that it comes with lists Hunter's Moon first.  When it is played, Question Authority comes before Hunter's Moon.  Normally this would not be a problem, since most JLU episodes are stand alone versus the 2 episode format of JL.  !!!SPOILER ALERT!!! However, Question Authority is the first episode in the CADMUS/Brainiac arc.  So at the end of this episode, when Superman and Capt. Atom are about to fight, it ""cuts away"" to Hunter's Moon!  I was surprised and perplexed.  I don't know if I got a bad print run or what, but this was the reason that prompted the review.

  Nevertheless, this is still a good deal.  As mentioned before, a dollar per episode is my threshold to buy animated box sets, american or japanese.  The issues outlined above might be enough to dissuade someone to wait for the inevitable limited edition and/or blu-ray print runs.  For me, it wasn't enough to return it.  There are still 3 discs left to view, both discs of JLU season 2 and JL season 2 disc 2.  This review will be updated if those discs have anymore surprises.

SETUP:PS3 Slim to HDMI Audio/Video splitter to (video) 42"" Panasonic Viera CCFL 60 Hz LCD and (audio) Sony HTDDW790 (cheap 5.1 HTIB, but audio for the set is only dolby 2.0 so I doubt it matters)",1291075200,111,2487,4.441241685144124

Now getting on to my actual review, the metal casing the two volumes come in is a nice piece of art. The series is perhaps the best DC universe series ever created; the drawing is incredible, and the story lines are beyond comparison (season 2, 3 part finale ""Starcrossed."") The only complain i actually have is that Shayera Hol (Hawkgirl) and Wally West (the Flash) aren't in the story lines as often as I would like.",1285891200,2,625,4.387931034482759
3361842,4,B00149LMDU,"Justice League is a great show and the price is awesome for this set.  The metal box packaging is actually quite nice, but the assembly of the snap packs inside is where the issues come in.  As others have said, the disc sets are swapped.  Volume 1's discs are put in Volume 2's box and vice versa.  I also had some pegs broken in one of the snap cases as well, making it impossible to flip through one set of discs.

3361847,5,B00149LMDU,"Trying to buy all 4 seasons separately is a pain and will cost more, but if you can find this, price it, most likely it will turn out to be a great value.  One beef I have, is that they throw in one extra spiecial features disc that really has no special features on it.  Has a lot of preview for other things to buy on DVD but that's about it.  The special features in the first two seasons were far better than the second two seasons, however, that quality of animation in both are grand.  The only physical problem I had was in my copy the two plastic cases that hold the DVDs had the paper borders switched (Unlimited was on the JL and JL on JLU)and the JLU case had a broken piece, making flipping through the discs a pain.

3361896,5,B00149LMDU,"I am someone who has come very late to the party, only seeing several Justice League stories a year or 2 ago. I have always been a huge fan of Batman the Animated Series, but not so much the Superman one.
That being said I must say that The Justice League Complete Collection was an exceptional watch, covering stories from the initial forming of the Justice League, to stories that involved time travel, and all the unique powers and skills each of the heroes bring to this well crafted cartoon.

Personally I enjoyed the original 2 seasons of Justice League over the Justice League Unlimited seasons as they have fewer heroes, making for more personal and involving stories. My favorite story was one involving The Justice Lords.

If you have ever enjoyed Batman or Superman Animated Series, Justice League Complete Collection is well worth it.

Thank you Bruce Timm & Co for yet again bringing another batch of great storytelling and action to a Saturday morning cartoon",1265155200,,973,4.81437125748503

3361898,5,B00149LMDU,"I'd only actually seen one episode of the Justice League show before I bought this set, and it was one I'd downloaded online. I'd been a huge fan of the Batman Animated Series growing up, so this show intrigued me. I read all I could about it - reviews, quotes, stuff like that - to make sure it was for me, before I finally made the plunge and purchased this boxed set. It was SO WORTH IT. If you enjoyed Batman, or even the Superman Animated Series, this show will not disappoint.

The actual set comes in a metal box with two plastic DVD cases inside. The cases have ""pages"", with a DVD stuck on the front and the back. My only complaint about these ""pages"" is that the DVDs are a little tricky to get off, as they like to stick and it's hard to get them off without a significant amount of pulling and bending of the page itself. I worried about breaking them at first because the initial disks were really stubbornly attached. However, it just takes a little practice to find the right method, and then the rest of the disks pop right off. Don't let this dissuade you from a purchase.

The box arrived promptly, on Christmas Week no less, and not a disk was out of place. The only thing wrong was the Volume One and Volume Two covers and booklets were in the wrong books. It was a small matter to switch them around, and then everything was perfect.

I wasn't into animated cartoons a few years ago, so there goes why I didn't bother watching this series. But, after getting clips sent to me via Youtube by a friend, I was instantly hooked. I was about to buy season 1 on DVD, but opted to wait until the complete series was released a few weeks later, because of the great value price of 67.99, can't beat that price! All 4 seasons were great, but my favorite 2 seasons were Justice League Unlimited season 1 and 2. I liked the usage of the many DC characters in those 2 seasons. Huntress, Green Arrow, Super Girl, Booster Gold, and Black Canary are my favorite characters, outside the original 7. This series wouldn't be complete without seeing villains such as Joker, Lex Luthor, Grodd, and Darkseid, which you see a quite a few times. I highly recommend JL: The Complete Set to anyone who already loves the DC Universe or for someone who is looking for a good, high action, well directed and written, animated series to dive into. A huge thank you to Bruce Timm and his team for making this great animated show[ among his other gem projects such as Batman: The Animated Series, Superman animated series and Batman Beyond].

3361946,5,B00149LMDU,"Join Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl for the ultimate superhero adventure. If you thought Batman: The Animated Series or The New Batman/Superman Adventures was good, then you haven't seen anything until you've checked out Justice League. It's difficult to explain just how awesome this series is in words. Probably the best way to sum it up is this: Justice League is the best superhero show ever.

Instead of leaning on cheesy one-liners and adolescent sidekicks who hang around just to teach viewers life lessons, Justice League cuts to the meat of storytelling with imaginative plotlines ranging from alien attacks to government conspiracies and realistic adult characters who mature both as a crime-fighting team and as friends as the series progresses. Instead of being a group of chummy friends, the heroes of Justice League don't always agree with one another, sometimes have trouble working with one another, and periodically leave and re-enter the plot -- each time with evidence that something happened to them in the interim.

In the beginning, the Man of Steel himself becomes a symbol for world peace, only to find out in an alien invasion that he can't save the world by himself. He enlists (well, as much as you can enlist) Batman and frees The Martian Manhunter, who then recruits newcomer Wonder Woman, an Amazon Princess named Diana, a wise-cracking Wally West, also known as The Flash, the militant Green Lantern, John Stewart, and the hot-headed, intelligent alien Shiera, also known as Hawkgirl.

Justice League: The Complete Series consists of 14 discs containing 91 episodes from both the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated TV series, plus a bonus 15th disc that includes a great feature with the creators of the series reflecting on the Justice League, the DC Animated Universe, the show's Super Friends origins, and how this series has changed the face of the superhero TV show. Other bonus features scattered throughout the collection include director's commentary on select episodes, behind the scenes features, and trailers for upcoming DC animated universe features.

This collection brings together every Justice League episode into a wonderful collector's edition in a sturdy tin with gorgeous character artwork. Inside the tin all of the discs are separated into two volumes, one with Justice League and the other with Justice League Unlimited. Both volumes have spectacular character cover art.

This series is perfect for die-hard fans or fans who have not yet purchased any of the previous Justice League DVDs. However, if you've already bought the DVDs, then Justice League: The Complete Series doesn't offer anything new beyond the bonus disc's short feature. In fact, it looks like WB just took the previous releases and smashed them all together and didn't even bother to change the artwork on the discs, booklets or the content of the discs themselves. Aside from the compilation and collector's aspect of the collection, it feels like WB got a little lazy and thought they could cash in on this franchise one more time. Despite that, Justice League is still the best superhero show ever made, and this is the best collection of Justice League out there.",1258761600,6,3266,5.178030303030303

I didn't know, or at least didn't remember, that it would be in a metal case, which was a great bonus.  Then I took the two 'books' out of the case to flip through the DVDs and I got a little perplexed.  The Volume 1 DVDs were in the Volume 2 Book and vice versa.  Odd, I thought.  So, I decided to 'fix' the problem by switching the DVDs out one by one, which I thought was a great idea until I realized there are more discs in the second book.  So, I had to switch the DVDs back to their original book and switch the cover and booklets instead.  Not a big problem and nothing worth complaining about, just thought I'd save anyone else with the same trouble the hassle of mistakenly trying to switch the discs.

8254722,3,B00149LMDU,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD set. On one hand, this set included every episode of both Justice League AND Justice League Unlimited, which was a welcome surprise. It's missing a few basic DVD features, such as English subtitles and ""making of"" documentaries, but I can live without those.

What I CAN'T live with though, is the fact they switched the order of the JLU episodes "" Question Authority"" and ""Hunter's Moon""! Normally I don't get upset over DVDs playing episodes out of order, but ""Question Authority"" was part of the climax of the Cadmus storyline, so switching it with an unrelated episode really breaks the flow of the story! I bought another JLU DVD because of this, and guess what? That one plays those episodes out of order too! Do the people making these DVDs not watch the show?

The order got delayed, purchased this last month, kept on following up with their cs. Gladly, the last person I emailed with issued a replacement for free and I gave her 5 stars for that and those provided compensation and effort for helping me out. Received the item the other night. The case is cool. Just started watching last night, I thought its in HD but its not and its ok. Got 1 episode Starcrossed and it seemed like it couldn't be viewed in full screen. Anyways, I think this is a super cool collection.",1521158400,,650,4.425
8254725,1,B00149LMDU,"I got the 10 disc version of the complete series. No fan fare menus, basic, and no special features.

What I thought I'd get, though, was (after so fraaking long) I thought I'd be getting a DVD set with quality transfers of the episodes to DVD. I own the original released dvds, and it bugged me to high hell that season 2 looked like such a mess. Not only is the episode in widescreen, but not zoomed in, but there are distortion lines in all the art and drawings. It NEVER looked like this on tv!!! But on DVD, it seems it's always going to be like this! My favorite episose, twilight, is seemingly only viewable with sketchy lines and bad DVD transfer.

This is a masterful series, and IT DESERVES BETTER!",1519948800,,708,4.356060606060606
8254726,1,B00149LMDU,"This series is great if you're under 12 years old.  The artwork is mediocre, and the stories are slow-paced, dragged out, simplistic, and boring.  DC knocks it out of the ballpark on most of their animated series and movies, but this is the worst out of the bunch.  It is incomprehensible to me how this series received so many good ratings.",1518134400,,341,4.557377049180328
