8375336,4,B002NSACFU,"I have several of Leslie Sansone's exercise dvds.  This one must have been one of her first.  Although it is not my favorite, I do think it is very good.",1403481600,,153,4.066666666666666
8375337,5,B002NSACFU,"This is one of my favorite 2 mile walks from Leslie. It is brisk, but not exhausting, so it is very suitable for beginners. Remember what Leslie says: 'Do as much as you can... you will build up to it.' Also included are toning exercises. These are to get you started on a toning routine, and are also suitable for beginners. The cast are some of Leslie's friends from her studio like  Mary Kay and Joanne, They are all smiling, the music is good. Leslie does say a few words about Nutrisystem, but not overly so. Try it. It's a fun walk!",1328918400,,538,4.2745098039215685
8375338,5,B002NSACFU,I use this and it is a great way to work out indoors and enjoy it.  This DVD also has some toning exercises at the end of the 2 minute walk.  I also ordered the 3 mile Fast Walk and alternate between the two.,1320796800,,208,3.7045454545454546
8375339,5,B002NSACFU,"The seller was excellent in every aspect of the delivery process -also generous not to charge me for the wrong DVD sent out first. As for the workout program itself: it is invigorating just to begin to listen to the instructor's talk at the beginning and very easy to get through without feeling any discouragement along the way, as the instructor keeps reminding the viewer to do everything at their own pace and comfort. Before long, the workout session is over. Fabulous!",1280361600,,474,4.7926829268292686
