Ah, the days when you didn't have to monitor what your kids watched for fear of swears and inappropriate body shots. This is a feel good movie that I watch every christmas (and thanksgiving).",1309219200,,302,4.315789473684211

Being a fan of The Racoons, I found this special to be quite good, though not as good as the series. It  was kind of crudely drawn, but it still had that certain something. In  conclusion,I give this movie 3 stars. Thank you for your time.",962323200,,353,4.0285714285714285
