8753971,3,B01CRIWS7U,First half comical in nature. Second half more serious and tragic. Worth a view.,1490054400,2,80,4.785714285714286

8753973,5,B01CRIWS7U,"Much better than I thought it would be - all the actors are well suited to their parts and the story held my interest. If you are looking for something light, silly but still interesting, you might enjoy 3 Beauties.",1484179200,3,215,4.4
8753974,5,B01CRIWS7U,"Love the twisty ending! It seems pretty normal in the beginning, with the portrayals of obsession. (Warning! Some scenes could be triggering to anyone who has suffered from ED's.) The deeper you go into the movie, I felt myself saying, ""Really?!?!?!"". Asking will they really go that far? Yes, they will, and yes, they do. Even as horrible things happen, life in the movie moves on, as real life often does. This movie does not pull any punches as it depicts just how ugly the world of beauty, and the people who obsess over it can be.

I think it's artful storytelling when you don't know who you should root for, as your sympathies for characters shifts around. Overall, VERY entertaining.",1482105600,3,691,4.710743801652892

8753976,5,B01CRIWS7U,Very great. Especially for the AP Spanish Unit on Belleza y Esttica. There's no movie as entertaining. My students loved the unexpected ending.,1479427200,7,143,5.260869565217392
8753977,3,B01CRIWS7U,"Funny, off-beat and as crazy as you can imagine a beauty pageant family being.",1478822400,,78,4.642857142857143
