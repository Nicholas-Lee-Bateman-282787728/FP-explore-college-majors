8075812,5,B000A7Q282,My husband loves the show As Told By Ginger and use to watch it on television. They went off the air so I tried to get them on DVD. They only had The Wedding Frame and Far From Home so I purchased them both for him. I am still hoping they come out with the TV series on DVD. I would purchase them all for him.,1346198400,2,309,3.696969696969697
8075813,5,B000A7Q282,"Honestly, As Told By Ginger was one of the best shows for the child-tween age-group. Even now, as a teenager, I still enjoy this show.  ATBG covers many different topics, even death, and brings it down to a younger age-ranged target.  I remember watching this show when I was younger, and even my mother and grandmother watched it with me, and enjoyed it.  Like the other reviewer said, ATBG is pretty much unknown, and it is unfair, even with the bigger directors from the more popular cartoons on Nick.  It doesn't even just target girls, with a younger brother included in the cartoon, making it fun for boys to watch, also.
  I believe that this is definitely one of the best cartoons that has ever aired, and as you watch it, it's doesn't 'act' like a cartoon.  No stupid blow-ups, slapstick routines, or lame, cliche stuff like that.  It will be one of your best buys.  You definitely would enjoy As Told By Ginger over and over again, and your whole family can watch it without rolling their eyes, or having to cover them.",1204848000,7,1029,4.548913043478261
8075814,5,B000A7Q282,"As Told By Ginger is one Nickelodeon's lesser known Nicktoons. Yet it combines some of the finest animation from the Klasky-Csupo studios (Rugrats, All Grown Up) with often clever writing from the independent series creator Emily Kapnek. ATBG gives a fresh take on the classic 'girl-in-junior-high' theme.

With this package you get two of the series tv-movies (aka Nickflicks) and a few episodes from the first season. Of the two, 'The Wedding Frame' is definitely the better one. Not only do you get the series finale (with a vintage Ginger surprise ending) but also two strong episodes with 'Stealing First' and the character-defining 'Dare I, Darren'.

'Far From Home' has a strong start but the script loses track halfway through the movie. But you also get the series first-ever episode 'Ginger The Juvey', which gives a great introduction to the main cast.

In short: a must-have for all fans and anyone who thinks a US animated series has to be either cartoonish junk or overly sappy melodrama.",1169251200,11,1002,4.9880239520958085
