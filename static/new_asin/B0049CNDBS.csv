4287728,5,B0049CNDBS,"I have always had a fireplace and would routinely light it from October to April when I lived in Boston.  I have now retired to Panama City Florida and it has been getting nippy and I have been itching for a fireplace to sit beside with my new honey.  I bought this not expecting much but I have been impressed.  I have a big 50 inch TV and when the DVD is playing the atmosphere of my beach house is so much cozier and romantic it is almost unreal.  I have purchase a few different styles of fireplace DVD but for overall romance and atmosphere, this is by far my favorite.",1318550400,,574,4.1441441441441444
4287729,5,B0049CNDBS,"So, I just pulled out all of my Fireplace For Your Home DVDs in preparation for the holidays and colder weather, so I had to review all of them! Yes, I have the Christmas versions with the music, but this one is really different than the rest. If you're looking for a relaxing, calm fireplace with lit candles to really set the mood for a couple rather than a family, this is the way to go. And when I say ""set the mood,"" I even mean a chill evening on the couch to rejuvenate from a stressful day, perhaps with some wine or tea. The audio and video is really high quality, and I honestly recommend this whole line Fireplace For The Home rather than any other. I am obsessed with these and enjoy the pretty fireplace DVDs on my flat screen as a high quality substitute to the real thing.",1318377600,2,787,4.218543046357616
4287730,5,B0049CNDBS,"My wife and I fell ln love with these kinds of DVDs. While we own the fire place Blu-ray and some others on DVD, this one really helps sets the mood. After a long day of work for both of us, it's a great way to wind down on a Friday night. Saturday night we love to go out, but after a long work week, you can't beat opening a bottle of wine and just vibing out and communicating everything that went on.

A great way to communicate more with your loved one.

Easily worth the cost. Grab more than one.",1318291200,,502,3.9603960396039604
4287731,5,B0049CNDBS,"I absolutely love this DVD. Creates a perfect backdrop for a lovely evening with my wife.  It makes everything feel so romantic. The picture quality is superb and the crackling sound of the fireplace is very relaxing. I use it to help me fall asleep sometimes. Makes for some great white noise if you live in an area that is noisy at night like I do. I get so much use out if it, it was well worth my investment. Great product.",1318204800,6,427,4.2073170731707314
4287732,5,B0049CNDBS,"I'm not going to go in detail with my experiences using this product, but I will confirm that it does the job of setting the mood. And it does it damn well. If you don't have a real fireplace, or aren't in a spot where there is one, this is the next best thing.",1318204800,3,261,3.8518518518518516
4287733,5,B0049CNDBS,"My husband and I enjoy our glass of wine or coffee together.  It is a great way to catch up on things...kids, work & busy life.  This DVD is such a great addition to our conversation and it creates instant romantic environment for us.  My husband doesn't need to go and get the firewood...and no need to worry about cleaning up after we enjoy our wine or coffee. Music is another great addition to our Candlelight romantic moments.  It is a MUST have for your romantic evening!!!  We love it!",1293062400,3,492,4.4222222222222225
4287734,5,B0049CNDBS,"I love this DVD. It is the perfect way to wind down after a hectic day. We used to have a fireplace but our new house does not so I wanted to give this a try. The sound is great, the picture is superb and you can actually see the wood burning!",1292371200,4,243,3.6923076923076925
4287735,5,B0049CNDBS,"I absolutely LOVE these DVD's, I've had a few others that just do NOT compare in quality. I Love the crisp crackling, crystal clear picture and a realistic feeling of warmth that it provides, Love it!!",1291852800,2,201,4.611111111111111
4287736,5,B0049CNDBS,Loved that you could plug this into the DVD player and it ran all evening long without having to get up and tend to it.  Perfect for that relaxing evening at home.,1291852800,6,163,4.09375
8418969,3,B0049CNDBS,"This DVD is okay, but I don't find the sound to be all that great even through good speakers.  If you know someone with a nice fireplace you could make your own with the camera on your cell phone and it would be just as good or better.  But if you just want to buy a fireplace DVD then it will do the job.",1423958400,,305,3.75
8418970,1,B0049CNDBS,This was VERY disappointing.  The Fireplace is natural sounds and doesn't give an option for music.  The music is only offered with a CANDLE image....VERY VERY disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this...save your money and purchase the FIRE 2.0 if you want good romance with many Fireplace options!,1419811200,,310,5.416666666666667
8418971,5,B0049CNDBS,"My 87 year old mother loves her CD of this crackling fireplace.  She is so funny ... after it has been on her TV for a while, she actually starts feeling the heat, and has to take her sweater off!  She is the hit of her assisted living home, as all the other residents want to come and visit her and sit by the fireside with her for a while!",1397260800,,341,3.857142857142857
8418972,5,B0049CNDBS,"I bought this DVD for my elderly parents. They live in their own house. My mother is bedridden and my father takes care of her even though he uses a walker to get around. They have a fireplace, but no longer have the ability to use it. Although they keep their house very warm, they see the snow outside and they feel chilled. They LOVE this DVD. It is very ""REAL"" down to the actual crackling sounds from the wood as it burns. You can imagine the warmth coming from the TV!! It plays in a continuous loop so they can experience a ""warm fire"" for many hours if they chose to. The DVD also has a 2nd ""film"" of candles that is accompanied with classical music. They have enjoyed this very much as well.",1390953600,,700,4.192592592592592
8418973,5,B0049CNDBS,We love it! The flames and crackling fire sounds are so relaxing. My husband turns it on every evening. Would definetly recommend it.,1386892800,,133,4.826086956521739
8418974,5,B0049CNDBS,We don't get many nights you can light and actual fire in Souther Caifornia and this looked perfect on my televisio,1365206400,,115,4.523809523809524
8418975,5,B0049CNDBS,"I finally figured out how to pick out the fireplace I wanted and use actual fire sounds, not  music.  Love the ambiance.",1361059200,,120,4.409090909090909
8418976,5,B0049CNDBS,"I had a fireplace dvd but it played Christmas music too & I was looking for one that I could enjoy year round. I read several reviews on both this particular dvd and on a few other dvd's. I settled on this one because of the reviews. More people seemed to be satisfied with this one. When I am enjoying the dvd, I mostly choose the fireplace over the candles with music but I have enjoyed both. I like the visual of the fire and the sound of the fire crackling & that I can use my sound volume to adjust it. I like that the dvd plays continuously...and I've fallen asleep in the living room while enjoying the fireplace as it seems to provide a quiet, serene atmosphere. I live in FL but am from IN, and the fireplace enhanced my holiday since I am no longer up in the cold weather.",1357689600,,782,4.117647058823529
8418977,5,B0049CNDBS,"The DVD is a beautiful, warm and evolving fire that snaps and sparks. The best feature is that it loops. There is a slight change in the picture when it loops, so if you are concerned with that this might not be the one for you - but it is truly a slight change. I used it for a stage production and it was brilliant. Highly recommend.",1325894400,,335,4.014925373134329
8418978,3,B0049CNDBS,"Am I the only reviewer who is bothered by the fact that you can't see the whole fire?  The camera is either too close, or focused on the wrong center point.  I don't care so much about seeing that there are no burning embers under the fire, but it would be nice to see the top of the fire. I've bought two of these fireplace DVD's and they all seem to cut off the top.  The crackling noise is not a plus, as it seems fake but at least you can mute the sound and just play your own music.  I do like the fact that I can have a fire and I don't have to do anything but push a button on my DVD player and were it not for the fact that I can't see the whole fire, I would have given this 4 stars.  I believe that it deserves a strong 3 stars.  That said, I haven't seen any of these fireplace DVDs where you actually see the top of the fire so it's at least as good as anything else out there.  This DVD also has the option of looking at candles and listening to music.  Okay, maybe its just me, but I don't get it.  I've seen some DVDs which offer the option of looking at candles but they have more candles and display them in a fireplace. These just seem to float in mid air.  The flames never move either - its weird.  I don't see the point. They don't do anything to add to a mood. If you get this DVD, just stick to the fireplace and put it on mute and play your own music. Live candles are so much better and everyone can buy those whereas not everyone has a fireplace.  If I had it to do over again, I'd just buy ""Fireplace For Your Home.""  Coincidentally, the fire in both of these DVDs is exactly the same.",1325203200,5,1612,3.8929663608562692
