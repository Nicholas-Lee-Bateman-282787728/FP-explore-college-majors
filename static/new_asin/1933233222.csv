7801705,5,1933233222,"I first saw this movie in 1980, when the JFK Library first opened. It was the original introductory movie for visitors to the Library. For a short film, it is an extremely moving evocation of the life of the late president. It provided visitors with a good grounding to his life, and prepared them for what they were about to see. Why they changed it for the film they currently run is beyond me. So if you are seeking a quick audio-visual biography of JFK that explains his origins and the challenges addressed during his administration, this is the movie to watch.",1433289600,,566,4.5588235294117645
7801706,5,1933233222,"This was the film that all visitors saw as an introduction to their visit to the JFK Presidential Library Museum in Boston from its opening in October, 1979, until its refurbishment and rededication in the fall of 1993. It was done in all black & white by the leading documentary filmmaker of the day, Charles Guggenheim, and is still a great piece. Very concise, packing JFK's lifetime and the Kennedy administration into 32 minutes, but did so very, very well. A great film to own, especially now in the 50th anniversary year (1960-2010) of the Kennedy campaign and the fabled years of ""Camelot"". Highly recommended.",1282867200,,618,4.895238095238096
