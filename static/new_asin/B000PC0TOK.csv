8454948,2,B000PC0TOK,"Being a long standing fan of James Last and owning most of his Music DVDs.
I found this DVD a very big disappointment! There is only 60 minutes of music on the disc which made up of the orchestra (unseen) playing 5 tracks (11Min) as background music to a documentry travelogue of James arriving back in Germany!! You then receive the next 8 tracks as the live Street concert with a duration of 36 mins, unbelievable!!?? The last track the ""Sabre Dance"" is played during the final credits orchestra not seen! The disc has a Bonus section?? which is made up of three numbers by the orchestra playing in a studio these three songs have a playing time of just over 9 minutes.
Considering the cost of this DVD I personally believe it is a ripp off.
The Warner Music Group of Germany should hold their heads in shame for releasing such a poor quality James Last dvd.
