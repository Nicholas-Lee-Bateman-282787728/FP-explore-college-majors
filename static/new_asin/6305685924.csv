1064417,2,6305685924,"Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's ""The Substitute"" has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess.",1082851200,3,505,5.170731707317073
1064418,3,6305685924,"THIS TIME, THE MERCENARY BECOMES A SUBSTITUTE AT A UNIVERSITY TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED HIS FRIEND. NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO, BUT IT'S STILL AN OK MOVIE. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT THE PLOT ISN'T AS GOOD THIS TIME AROUND. TREAT WILLIAMS IS STILL A GOOD SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AS KARL, THE MERCENARY. IT'S STILL A LOT BETTER THAN MOST DIRECT-TO-VIDEO ACTION MOVIES.",1071705600,,375,4.611940298507463

7893688,5,6305685924,"16:9 to fit my television perfectly. Not 5.1 but the audio is good. The 16:9 is ten times more important to me than the discrete audio. The next Substitute is discrete audio.
Amazon Prime recommended this four-movie set in an email a couple of months ago so I put all four on my Watchlist.
There was plenty of kicking, punching and stabbing.
There was hundreds of bullets flying and an explosion.",1496966400,,396,4.591549295774648
7893689,5,6305685924,I watched all three in series one weekend good guys against bad guys old fashion style and all were truly exciting and refreshing to watch......,1492732800,,144,4.8
7893690,2,6305685924,The first movie Substitute 1 was great.  The second movie (Sub II) was good but predictable.  The 3rd (Sub III) was so predictable it was boring.  Its like they borrowed the screen play from a bad 80's Roadhouse type movie.  I shut it off before it could finish.  A wet t-shirt contest does not make up for a lack of a good movie,1491696000,,329,4.158730158730159
7893691,5,6305685924,I did not order this. I have a prime account and this is free. So is Amazon so broke that they have to make fake charges to people? They also don't have any way for me to contact them about this charge.,1490918400,,202,3.8333333333333335
