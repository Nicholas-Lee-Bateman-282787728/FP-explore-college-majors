4506928,5,B004ZB92GI,"I am a big fan of Amy Dixon.  I also have Workout in 10 and absolutely love both of them.  I have so much fun, sweat so hard, and finish up feeling great.  Amy does a fantastic job of getting you excited while bringing up your heartrate.  One thing that Amy does better than anyone is cueing you to what come next.  I have done other videos and sometimes they leave you confused and make you do more than what they say.  Not Amy.  She is adorable, energetic, and honest.  I would totally recommend this workout to anyone.",1263772800,,521,4.244897959183674
4506929,5,B004ZB92GI,"Just got done doing Amy's new workout.  Absolutely loved it.  There's different and unique exercises that are fun too. Loved the last 10 min yoga segment!  Great Kettle ball 10 min. segment.  I don't have a kettle ball, but you can use a free weight.  Have to go buy one.  Maybe Amy will do a kettle ball tape.",1263686400,,310,4.258620689655173

4506931,5,B004ZB92GI,"This workout is a great way to add some activity without feeling overwhelmed.  While I tell myself I just need to complete 10 minutes, I always end up doing more because of the great pacing and the excellent instructor.",1263600000,,219,4.615384615384615
4506932,5,B004ZB92GI,"I love Amy's workouts and this is definitely a favorite of mine! It's great to choose a workout that fits my varying daily schedule. I can do more when I have the time, or do a little and still feel like I did some good for my body. Amy is an instructor that makes me want to come back and work a little harder each time. This is an awesome video and  a definite must have for those who like to work out at home and those who may not have time to get to the gym. Try it! You'll love the results!",1263513600,,495,3.8058252427184467
4506933,5,B004ZB92GI,"I am anxious to get my copy of this DVD.  I have Amy's previous titles, ""Ultimate Fat Burn"" and ""Total Workout in 10"".  They are the best fitness videos in my collection--great pace and excellent cues.",1263513600,,201,4.555555555555555
4506934,5,B004ZB92GI,When I can't make it to the gym or I'm short on time this DVD has been a lifesaver! Amy Dixon is amazing! I give this and Amy's other DVD's my highest recommendation.,1263513600,,166,4.0606060606060606
4506935,5,B004ZB92GI,"Amy is a great trainer!  I've actually taken a few of her classes here in LA... lots of fun and always a great workout.  ""Give Me 10!"" is cool because it's a bunch of 10 minute workouts that you can mix and match to get a different workout every time.  Even if you're short on time, each workout only takes 10 minutes!",1263513600,,318,4.096774193548387
4506936,5,B004ZB92GI,"Amy's newest video is amazing! I loved all the yoga moves as well, being a yoga teacher. As a yoga teacher, I am also looking for ways to cross -train and she has given me the perfect vehicle. The workouts are creative and fun. She makes it easy to follow along and keeps you from feeling bored by continually challenging you to challenge yourself. I love all her videos but this one is by far my favorite. From a yoga teacher in L.A. I am telling my students about this one!",1262563200,5,475,4.230769230769231
4506937,5,B004ZB92GI,"I've written a few reviews for some other Amy Dixon workouts before, so I'm elated to add another one to the mix.  She is one of my favorite instructors by far.  I've actually had this DVD for a few months now, but I figured with everyone's New Year's Resolutions out there, I'd finally give my two cents and help a few people out

Listen everyone, this DVD is SO MUCH FUN!

There are a whole bunch of these 10-minute workouts out there.  Even Amy herself has one she did a few years ago with Women's Health that I raved about when it initially came out (Total Workout in Ten.)  So this one is kind of a sequel, in a way.  But in my opinion, this one is way better.  And in fact, this is probably the best 10-minute workout DVD on the market right now.  There is so much variety!  All these different kinds of little 10 minute workouts can be done on their own when you're short on time (or stamina, which is sometimes my problem), or they can be combined to make for a well rounded, and full (exhausting) workout.

There's five of the 10-minute workouts, and a bonus sixth.  The segments are cardio, upper body, lower body, core, and an awesome yoga segment.  And the bonus is a kettlebell segment, which is insane (I'm not quite there yet, but I plan to be!)  But the coolest part is that the DVD is programmable to do whichever of the workouts you want, in whatever order.  It's so cool!  And it never gets boring!

I'm telling you, a lot of these little 10-minute workout DVDs don't do much at all, barely working up a sweat.  But trust me, if you know Amy Dixon by any of her other workouts, you know that she doesn't mess around.  She is pretty hardcore and you will feel it.

If you do this a few times a week, it is impossible to not lose weight!  And you will never be bored doing it!  Mark my words.  5 bigtime stars.",1262563200,16,1827,4.216763005780347
4506958,5,B004ZB92GI,"I like the flexibility to pick & choose the 10 minute segment.  Cardio is not as intense as the breathless body series, though.",1471219200,,127,4.521739130434782
4506959,3,B004ZB92GI,"I like the idea of a quick cardio, but this was very fast and I am not that coordinated especially when there are so many move changes in the sets. Everything changed so quickly it was hard to follow.  I have two other of Amy's Give Me 10 cds and they're great.  This one I found too much to concentrate on for a quick workout.  Guess I prefer some repetition rather than all the change ups.",1461801600,,391,4.118421052631579
4506960,5,B004ZB92GI,"I love Amy Dixon as a trainer. She isn't easy and I sweat buckets doing this workout. You will get a killer lower body workout if you do the entire DVD. I think her Give Me 10 series is on of my favorites from her. I love Kickin' Strength as well because I am a kickboxing fan and it burns calories but this workout is really good to get in strength, cardio and flexibilty all on one DVD. I would love it if she did some more Give Me 10 workouts!",1461715200,,446,3.912087912087912

4506963,4,B004ZB92GI,"I have many of Amy's Tapes. My favorite Ultimate Fat Burn (Woman's Health) went missing today. I like the Ultimate Fat Burn because it is kind on my back, knees, and elbows. I have had two knee surgeries, a chronic lower back and tendinitis in both elbows. Give Me 10 was an excellent workout and did not effect any of my problem areas. I was able to do the entire workout including the Yoga segment with some slight modifications. At my age (64), I enjoy Amy's workouts as they are not too taxing on my joints and give an excellent cardiovascular and stretching workout.",1431216000,,571,4.5

4506978,5,B004ZB92GI,"Great work out.  Amy is always encouraging and enthusiastic.  Her exercises are no nonsense but not boring or repetitive (although I always groan when we have the ""opportunity"" to do it again on the other side).  This works for both a compressed time schedule as well as a longer work out targeting multiple body parts.  One of my ""go to"" DVDs.",1407369600,,344,4.590163934426229

4506980,3,B004ZB92GI,I'm a fan of Amy Dixon's workouts. I did the entire 50 minutes plus the stretch at the end. It was challenging but this wasn't my favorite from her. Some of the moves were awkward and I felt like there was potential for injury.,1391212800,2,227,4.181818181818182
4506981,5,B004ZB92GI,"GIVE ME 10 is great.  GIVE ME 10 MORE is killer (in a good way).  I found this dvd to be slightly more advanced than GIVE ME 10.  It's a fast paced, intense workout.  I recommend working through it segment by segment, and pausing when necessary.  It's a great workout and a wonderful challenge!",1390780800,,294,4.37037037037037
4506982,5,B004ZB92GI,"Amy Dixon is an amazing instructor.  I love her BREATHLESS BODY workouts, so I decided to give her GIVE ME 10 a try.  This is a wonderful workout too.  All of the segments are 10 minutes long, which is great because each 10 minute segment is so intense / power packed that you will get a good workout whether you do one or all six segments.",1390780800,,340,4.121212121212121
4506983,5,B004ZB92GI,"I love Amy Dixon and all her Womens Health DVDs so I decided to try this one as well.
It met all my expectations and was a fantastic workout which incorporated yoga and kegel ball as well.

I also find Amy Dixon's instruction style highly motivating and inspiring!

Highly recommended!",1390435200,,285,4.68
4506984,5,B004ZB92GI,"love Amy Dixon I have a few of her DVD's...what is nice is you can complete a workout in 10 minutes, so if you don't have much time you can still exercise, everyone has an extra 10 minutes",1389398400,,188,3.973684210526316
4506985,4,B004ZB92GI,"I'm moderately fit so I found this to be a good workout. A bit sore the day after but not too bad. The Cardio section does get your heart rate up but I found myself needing to do a bit of work to get my heart rate up again after the Upper Body workout.

I haven't done Yoga before so I thought the instructions on that could have been a bit clearer. Hopefully after I've done it a few times it'll become clearer.

Overall it's a good video that gave me a good all body workout with fairly clear instructions & Amy is a likeable instructor.",1369008000,,539,4.0754716981132075
4506986,5,B004ZB92GI,This is the best workout DVD I purchased in years.  Amy does a great job of keeping me motivated and the exercise variations keep me from getting  bored.  Highly recommended!,1365292800,,174,4.733333333333333
4506987,4,B004ZB92GI,"I've worked out in spurts all my life but it's been a consistent thing for the past 3 years. I'm not an athlete but I do consider myself in shape. I incorporate different types of workouts so my body won't get comfortable (yoga, step, circuit training, Zumba, etc.). I first came across the cardio section of this workout on ExerciseTV. I enjoyed that 10-minute burst so much that I bought the workout. I haven't done the 10-minute kettlebell section yet but I LOVE every other section so I'm sure I'll love that one. My favorite so far is the lower body workout. It's a BEAST - in JUST 10 minutes! I just wish I could program which sections I wanted to do in the beginning rather than going back to the menu each time a 10-minute section is finished. Overall I would definitely recommend this DVD. Amy is an excellent instructor and she definitely pushes you.",1363910400,,860,4.519230769230769

4507009,5,B004ZB92GI,"Great workouts and I love that I can choose my targets.  Some days I choose cardio and arms, some days Leg's and abs.  There is also yoga and kettlebell.  10 mins quick workouts for busy people but the intensity is there and I sweat!",1363478400,,233,4.25
4507010,5,B004ZB92GI,I recommend this dvd to all that want to workout but don't have the time. Amy gets you going for a full 10 min where you feel like you worked out for at least a good 20 minutes. Best 10 min workout segments that I have come across!,1362355200,,231,3.8333333333333335
4507011,1,B004ZB92GI,I got no response to this one.  I guess it wasn't what she was looking for.  Hope next one is better,1360972800,,100,3.7142857142857144
4507012,5,B004ZB92GI,"Amy is very professional and to the point. It is obvious she knows what she is doing and is very good at explaining each move, while performing it. She does every move along with her models. Her DVD is broken into 10 minute segments. No warm up or cool down stretch, but I like that, because I can do it on my own and save time. No unnecessary talking. The kettle-bell segment at this end is a great intro to kettle-bells, of which I am a fan. I love the 10 minute options. Often I do 10 and after 10, I feel like doing 10 more.",1344211200,,528,3.990566037735849
4507013,1,B004ZB92GI,"Where to start with this video, first 3 minutes are all adverts that you cant fast forward! the timing is off, the first ""10"" minutes are really 1130 and the 2nd 10 minutes of the lower body is 730 or so, and there is all the whohooing! which I could do without. I would not buy this again, its was also too easy for me , maybe good for beginners!",1329782400,5,347,3.9714285714285715
4507014,5,B004ZB92GI,"This video is one the best workout DVD's!!! I love Amy Dixon! Not only is it quick and easy, but you get results! I highly recommend this DVD to any one who wants to stay toned, especially if you have a busy lifestyle. It never gets boring!",1328832000,,240,4.127659574468085
4507015,4,B004ZB92GI,"I decided to check out Amy Dixon's workout dvds since Exercise Tv was removed from my On Demand. I had been doing her cardio kickbox on demand and had noticed a difference in my body after only a few weeks. I really enjoyed that workout so much and was so disappointed when it was gone. After reading alot of reviews for most of her DVDs, I decided to try this one. I agree with another reviewer about the lack of a warm up. You just jump right into it but as for the cool down, I've just used the yoga/flex. I've done all the workouts except the kettle bell and core. I've done the cardio and then the upper or lower body sculpt. After doing the cardio and then lower body, I was sweatier than I've ever been when working out!!! I was surprised at how challenging the workouts were. I've been working out for about a year but I'm a total lightweight and would still consider myself to be a semi-beginner. I can usually keep up with the other DVDs I've done but I had to pause for amoment during the lower body. By the end of the day, my butt, front and back of thighs were sore. Would like to try out her other DVDs eventually. But I would recommend this. It feels like I got a 20 minute workout in but in only 10 minutes.",1326240000,2,1223,4.142857142857143
4507016,4,B004ZB92GI,"Let me start by saying that I am a big Amy Dixon fan. I have several of her videos as well as the ones she did for Women's Health. (Her personal ones are much harder). I really enjoy Give Me 10 so I thought I'd like GM10M too. While the video itself is good, it's not as good or challenging as the first one",1325721600,5,307,3.8125
4507017,5,B004ZB92GI,"This is a very good workout for the beginner level. DIxon is easy to follow and high energy, however this was not as advanced as I was looking for. Its great on an easy workout day.",1324598400,,181,4.055555555555555
4507018,3,B004ZB92GI,"I love Amy Dixon's workout videos and own all of them. One of the reasons I like her so much is her great cues of what's coming up without losing your place. This video starts out much faster than her other (earlier) ones and doesn't give a very long warm-up. She uses moves that are similar to, but different from other videos and is moving through them faster as well. I still enjoy this video but would not recommend it for beginners or people who need more time to see an learn the next move, or get ""lost"" easily. It was a good workout combining strength and cardio although I felt it was more focused on the strength training. I'd recommend it for Amy fans who are used to her other workouts and can adapt quickly.",1318204800,4,720,4.301470588235294
4507019,5,B004ZB92GI,"This is an amazing DVD. Amy is a great instructer, not overly annoying or chatty. She's not overly skinny either, just toned! I love that she does this workout with you, not do a couple of reps then walk around and talk while the back up excercisers sweat!
I think she explains the moves well and she has good timing too.
Great dvd over all!",1318118400,,341,4.2615384615384615

4507021,4,B004ZB92GI,"I definately work up a sweat with this video. But I feel like the moves are a bit 'clunky', especially in the cardio section. Ihave a hard time getting the moves down. But prehaps I need to do it somemore, as I've only done it twice.
Either way I like Give Me Ten better!",1316822400,,271,4.037037037037037
4507022,5,B004ZB92GI,"I purchased Give Me 10 More at the same time as Breathless Body and they are both different workouts but equally as good!.. The beauty of Give Me 10 More is that they are a bunch of ten minute workouts, eack one gives you a great workout plus a warm-up and you can do one, two or up to 6 of workouts per session, depending on your time limits or energy levels.  With two levels of difficulty this dvd is good for all walks of life, from beginners through to advanced athletes.  Amy Dixon has a way of making you WANT to enjoy exercising and WANTING to do your best, even if you weren't really in the mood to work out (and we all have those days!!).  I am very pleased with the results I get from this dvd and look forward to the next dvd that Amy brings out :)",1316131200,8,760,4.0198675496688745

Amy is a great instructor,,and the moves that she presents are fresh and new....thank goodness a new approach to the same old boring lunges and squats (sorry Tami Lee). I'm amazed at the level of exhaustion I reach in just 10 minutes and still feel it the next day! Wow.",1315958400,,335,4.333333333333333
4507024,5,B004ZB92GI,"I was getting bored with the gym and needed something new to mix it up.  Amy's DVDs were perfect to get me out of my rutt and add some new moves to my routine.

Amy actually makes me look forward to working out - with each new move, she demonstrates, cues and teachs so that I feel confident that I am doing the exercises correctly, plus she is upbeat, encouraging, motivating at the same time. Whether you want to only do one 10 minute section, or mix and match to create a longer workout, you will not be disappointed.  Check it out!",1311638400,2,521,4.427083333333333
4507026,3,B004ZB92GI,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

This cardio workout was tough enough to keep my heart rate in the zone without straining to keep up.  Music was good with a strong beat, instructor was decent, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying.  Could really use a music only option since the instructor never stops talking and I can already tell that, with repeated viewings, I will only get annoyed with that much repeated chatter.

I felt the cardio choreography was more complex and awkward than it needed to be --- was there really that much more benefit from lunging in so many different directions with different arm movements sequentially?  Or doing skip-gallops instead of jumps or jogging?  I give the instructor credit for trying to keep things fresh with new moves (both the move itself and frequent move changes.)  That said, it is tricky to come up with new moves and new sequences of moves that make sense and flow well and this just did not do it for me.  While I was able to follow, I had to think twice as hard and did not feel like the result was worth that much more brain power expended.

Despite giving me the workout level that I am after (which is getting harder and harder to find since I have been collecting workout DVDs for a while now), after doing this workout twice, I have decided it is just not a keeper for me.",1309132800,7,1346,4.528925619834711
4507027,5,B004ZB92GI,"My review might echo the words of the prior reviewers. Amy Dixon's, Give Me 10 More, is the best way to tone up when pressed for time. The first DVD, Give Me 10 totally rocked and I saw results fast. But Amy went even further to offer even more energizing and efficient ways to work the body. This DVD and all the others that star Amy Dixon work. You work hard. The exercises are manageable. But best of all, Amy Dixon is the real deal. I could care less what reality TV star with 15 minutes of fame claims to call themselves a ""fitness star."" Amy Dixon knows her stuff with an array of exercise science, group fitness/ coaching experience and certifications on her resume, Dixon defiantly deliverers quality workouts that leave you feeling like you belong on the list of Hollywood's hottest body. But who cares what others think, its how you feel and Amy's positive  motivation makes you chant, ""Yes I can"" throughout the whole hour. What makes Amy's products so well produced is that the exercises feel natural, safe, and have enough leeway to increase the intensity at anytime.  My body always feels dynamic and strong after doing this DVD. A master instructor by far, it saddens me to see so many non-teachers produce exercise dvds, who have no clue how to cue, coach, and are off tempo. With Amy Dixon's DVDs you get top notch coaching, the most direct cueing, and versatile variations so that you feel success as your body will look and feel its best.

4507038,5,B004ZB92GI,"This DVD is an awesome follow-up to the first DVD, Give Me 10. I was privileged enough to workout with the real Amy Dixon alive and in person at Equinox in Santa Monica for four years, when, thanks to her, I was the fittest I've ever been in my life. There's a reason why she has groupies; buy this DVD and you'll quickly figure out why. When I left Los Angeles, I missed Amy's classes so much that I bought all of her DVDs; I use them religiously. Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY on television, on a reality show, in a gym class, is a better instructor than Amy Dixon. Why? Because she's not an instructor, she's a coach, and she's REAL. She motivates, inspires, works hard WITH you, and makes you feel like an athlete. She has heart and soul and she will kick your booty -- and you will enjoy it! You will also feel the results: 10 minutes with Amy is like 60 minutes with someone else. You work hard, you look better as you keep doing the workouts, and more than anything else, you FEEL GOOD and have more energy. These DVDs provide an experience, they're not just a workout to get through before moving on with your day. You'll WANT to do them. I take them everywhere, all around the world, when I travel. Even 10 minutes makes a difference, which is why the segmented structure of the DVD is so useful for busy moms and dads, overworked professionals, and truly, anyone else who wants to stay fit and strong. I've given Amy's DVDs as gifts to my parents (who are in their 70s and love her workouts), to friends, to colleagues. She is truly the most inspirational teacher and fitness coach in the country. There aren't enough stars here for an appropriate rating -- there should be 10!",1305849600,15,1686,4.355555555555555

4507040,2,B004ZB92GI,"With all the great reviews for this DVD I was excited to get it... but there is NO warm up or cool down!  How can that be?  So if you want to do the cardio, it just goes right in to it full force.  Very disappointing.",1299974400,3,217,3.6739130434782608
4507041,1,B004ZB92GI,do not buy this video if you want directions and precautions of any of the moves.  Dangerous unless you are experienced and are aware of the dangers of bad form during exercises.  Disappointed.  there are much better videos out there!,1296345600,,234,4.8
4507042,5,B004ZB92GI,"I have bought every AD DVD I can find.  She motivates you and therefore, you get results fast.  Her DVD's are all very different and offer the ADD personality a good workout.  I am an active person, but haven't actually worked out in probably 8 years. But, in 2 months, my 40 year old body already looks better! Thanks Amy!",1288569600,3,323,4.35

Keep a sensible diet, workout 3-5x a week for 30-45 mins, keep water intake high and YOU WILL GET RESULTS IN NO TIME!! JUST BELIEVE IT!",1286409600,5,313,4.413793103448276
4507044,4,B004ZB92GI,"Hi, love this DVD so much ! Excellent and clear instructions from Amy. challenging fitness DVD and would recogmend to anyone who has a busy life and not to much time for excercise.  Amazone's service was excellent and sufficient and I recieved the first order in 3 days flat. The only complaint is that we can't get the DVD for Region 0 or Region 2. The selection is limited and the other DVD I ordered doesn't play on our DVD machines. Please look into getting a bigger selection of the other Regions DVD as well please. Thx !!!!",1285459200,,530,4.408163265306122
4507045,5,B004ZB92GI,"I like this DVD because you can choose to have a short workout or do all of the sections and work out for an hour.  It is also nice to use in combination with other DVDs- if you have to work out for an hour to reach your weight-loss goal but most of your other DVDs only last 40 or 50 minutes you can easily add one or two sections from this DVD to make up the difference.  The exercises are clearly explained, and if you are a beginner you can watch the woman who is doing a modified version of each exercise.  The yoga section is great for cooling down and stretching after doing some of the other sections.",1280275200,4,609,4.058333333333334
4507046,5,B004ZB92GI,"I first discovered Amy Dixon on Exercise TV On-Demand, and bought the DVD when my favorite workout routine was no longer available. These ten-minute exercise routines are perfect for me because I work from a home office, and I can do 3 or 4 sessions throughout the day, just taking quick 10-minute breaks from work. They require minimal equipment (just a set of hand weights and a mat), and you don't have to have a huge amount of space to be able to do the workouts properly. My office is 12' X 11', and I use an area about half that size to work out. I also like that she includes a low-impact option for those of us who are old and have bad knees. Very good purchase in my opinion.",1279929600,13,684,4.229007633587786
4507047,5,B004ZB92GI,Great dvd. Sometimes I don't want to spend a long time on a full body workout.  The drop down menu lets me do all or just the parts of me I want to focus on for the day.  I really like the kettlebell workout.  Glad I added this to my workout collection.,1277683200,,253,3.826923076923077
4507078,5,B004ZB92GI,"This is the best, most effective exercise DVD I've ever used.
The kettle bell segment is great, you don't need to run out and get a kettle bell, I just use a 5 pound weight.  It's fast moving, before you know it you've done all of the segments.  Have a towel ready, it's a great workout!!!!  Better than going to the gym.  Buy it today!!!!!",1276128000,2,340,4.184615384615385
4507079,5,B004ZB92GI,"This video gets me going in ways others don't.  Amy is assertive yet gentle...she's great.  The first 10min(the cardio part)is sooo fun that at the end, I usually don't want to stop...so I don't!",1272153600,,195,4.705882352941177
4507080,4,B004ZB92GI,"I like this DVD a lot. I do all the segments except the yoga one, I do my own cool-down. The 10 minute segments seem to make the time pass more quickly. I like Amy's style, she's friendly and upbeat without being annoying. She is not superskinny or supermuscular, just slim and toned, which I like and aspire to. She does all the moves and has two people behind her, one of which shows beginner modifications. The moves are pretty straightforward (I don't like complex choreography). I'd say I'm intermediate, and I work up a pretty decent sweat in the first section (cardio) although some of the toning segments don't keep my heartrate as high as the intial cardio one (not surprising). I feel like it's a thorough and well rounded workout and I return to it frequently. It's not as intense as my favorite, Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, which keeps my heart rate up throughout, but it's a really nice alternative. The kettlebell segment was so good I went out and bought a kettlebell!",1271289600,5,1002,4.666666666666667
4507081,5,B004ZB92GI,"I have all but one previous Amy Dixon workout DVD's and rotate them consistently.  When I ordered this I wasn't certain how much different it could possibly be... it was totally different... slightly faster pace, new moves and just what I needed without knowing I needed it.  I really have an appreciation for her style - she is encouraging, can count (no all do... when you say 4 really should be 4 more reps:)) - and seems to have a down to earth personality - her friendliness is evident.  I highly recommend anyone looking for a great work out DVD!",1271203200,,552,4.5
4507082,5,B004ZB92GI,"I like this video very much, and use it a lot.  My one problem is with the yoga section--it's almost impossible to lie on the floor performing the moves while watching the screen (to see what you're supposed to be doing) at the same time.  I ended up watching part of it, memorizing it, then doing it, then watching the next part, and so on.  Not ideal.",1270425600,,353,4.2388059701492535
4507083,5,B004ZB92GI,I really like this DVD and really like Amy Dixon. Her workouts are excellent and she uses a wide variety of exercises to reduce boredom. I would say I am an advanced exerciser and this is a great workout! I just ordered Kickin Strength as well to alternate. Another instructor I recommend is Jessica Smith. She is very good on cueing and is a lot like Amy in using a wide variety of exercises. I just hope Amy puts out more DVDs soon! (I really like the kettle bell workout on the DVD. I had never done kettle bells before).,1266105600,,524,4.25
4507084,5,B004ZB92GI,"This is the first time I have ever written a review of a product.

Working out for me is a mood thing.  Sometimes I am in the mood and mostly I am not. I am easily bored with the same old routine. I own DVDs by:

Jillian Michaels
Beachbody
Core Fusion
Leslie Sansome
Robert Ferguson
Gunnar Peterson

and the list could go on...

However, this is the first exercise DVD I have ever used that made me smile when I was done.  The DVD has 6 workouts that are 10 min each. I said to myself I will only do one workout today I can spare 10 mins.  After the first workout which is the Fat Blasting Cardio, I felt worked and I was smiling.  I then decided I can try another workout it is only 10 mins.  Before I knew it I had do 4 of the six workouts, and I feel good!

I am a semi-beginner/intermediate.  I have done intense workouts in the past but currently I have a chronic back problem that keeps me contrained in what I can do. This DVD has allowed me to start moving again. It is challenging but not impossible to do.

Amy Dixon is an excellent instructor.  She does not do alot of extra talking and her cueing is flawless. In addition, unlike many instructors, SHE DOES THE ENTIRE WORKOUT WITH YOU.  She does not stop to talk and lose count. She is motivating and pleasant.

One of my major issues with workout DVDs is after a while you get tired of hearing the instructors constantly talking. Not with this one.  Amy only talks to setup the next move and to let you know when you are done.

If you are new to exercising and want to ease into it a little at a time, or you just want a quick challenging workout this is the DVD for you. Don't be surprised if 10 mins turns into 30 or 40.",1264377600,51,1685,4.072948328267477
4507085,5,B004ZB92GI,"Two thumbs up for Amy Dixon! This DVD is fantastic. I am a working, single mother and rarely ever have the time to work out. ""Give Me 10"" allows me to achieve small work outs at my own pace, while still giving me incredible results. I highly suggest this to working mothers!!",1263859200,,275,4.3076923076923075
