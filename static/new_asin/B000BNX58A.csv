2430461,5,B000BNX58A,barely there plot but who needs one when theres hot chicks running around the woods naked and making out with each other if your into naked chics and alittle lesbianism buy the whole series cuz the first 2 are the same as this one (theres a fourth only sold on the bare wench web site),1254787200,7,285,4.2
8089504,3,B000BNX58A,"Pros:
Good movie... huge Julie Strain fan...
Cons: its a Dv-r so even if you ""legally own it"" .. all your friends will think you started boot-legging junk.",1436400000,,155,4.571428571428571
8089505,1,B000BNX58A,Horrible,1415404800,,8,8.0
8089506,3,B000BNX58A,"It's rated R but it has a lot of skin for an R rated flick. I was looking for the original Bare Wench but it's no longer in stock. Somebody should get some more stock hint hint.

This is presented in 4:3 (1.33:1) format. It's not a bad buy if you like Julie K. Smith and Shauna O'Brien etc. Julie Strain is in the movie, but not much.

I wish sellers would start stocking Unrated versions of these movies instead of the R rated versions. Customers would appreciate that I'm sure.",1397347200,,479,4.252747252747253
8089507,3,B000BNX58A,"The story line is stupid, but then again your not watching this movie for the story line, you watching it to see the naked women, and there are 6 beautiful naked women in this, its sure to keep you busy, if your by yourself. But after watching this flick you will think to yourself even a chimp make a flick of this quality, and I wish I had. And I would have made myself the dumb guy in the movie",1380326400,,397,3.975
8089508,5,B000BNX58A,Nikki Frittz makes a huge improvement over the last two def worth while the other models on screen are really gorgeous as well!,1378252800,,127,4.565217391304348
8089509,3,B000BNX58A,"This movie really is pretty bad. The plot is a random series of events, nothing to do with a witch, rather a UFO abduction? The only saving grace is plenty of nice naked bodies. Lots of implants and running around. The dialog was even a bit hard to listen to, and there was the mandatory chubby idiot guy that I think was supposed to be comic relief? Seriously, the only reason I give this 3 stars is because the woman are nice to look at.

Example- Spoiler alert- The girls are walking along (5 of them) and they come to a river. One pulls out a dildo and points it an the river. OMG this water is toxic! Quick get out of the water! Don't worry, we have this chocolate syrup. Quick, take off your clothes and cover your selves with this chocolate! 5 minutes later, ok now wash it all off in the river. Cut to next scene.",1372809600,,821,4.163522012578617
8089510,1,B000BNX58A,"This is one of the lame plot, over done breast augmentation and probably best viewed with the sound off, you won't miss anything.",1370736000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8089511,4,B000BNX58A,"If you've seen the first 2, then there are no surprises here. Would have been 5 stars if Shauna O'Brien had done the FFN that two of the other girls did. Not bad, not great but definitely worth getting as there is plenty of topless activity.",1333152000,,241,4.260869565217392
8089512,3,B000BNX58A,"If you ave seen the first two movies then you know what to expect.  This is just more of the same walking around topless, genital jokes and a brief appearance by Julie Strain, as the bare wench, what could the twist possibly be this time.......Aliens.  They kidnapped our heroines sister and she will fight the evil aliens (using her sexuality to fire the weapon).  There could have been more Julie strain but then again with her name in the title you kind of expect more.  She only makes two appearances.  If you like mindless nudity then this is the movie for you.",1314835200,4,566,4.509803921568627
8089513,4,B000BNX58A,"This is a fun erotic paraody. I never seen the first two and i could care less either way. The girls are hot enough and they are searching for the bare wench in the woods. Like always, they lose their clothes and make out with each other. They use sex toys as strange tools of tracking and my fav. scene is when there dancing with the campfire background to the song, ""Lovesick"". It's a fun hot number. Don't expect much from this film but don't expect nothing either.",1256688000,2,468,4.329545454545454
