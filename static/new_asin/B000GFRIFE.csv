2608266,5,B000GFRIFE,"I think this show failed because the focus was more about helping those ladies, not about embarrassing them, and the ""beauty pageant"" was not all about appearances. The cosmetic surgery may have been a bit much (though, for comfort's sake, a few came by their need honestly), but I believe the concept of the show was good, and should someday be revamped.",1232236800,4,355,4.741935483870968

2608269,4,B000GFRIFE,"I really loved the show! The quality of the visual display could be better though. The show is older so some quality difference is to be expected but that was a little bit disappointing. Not only is it standard format with black bars at the sides but the crispness was not good at all. Otherwise I found the show to be really heartwarming! Get the tissues ready! Despite having a message of having to change ones' looks to feel beautiful, I felt the ladies were beautiful before the changes. It seems like they just needed that extra help and support to be dedicated for the 3 months to bring that beauty out and feel it... and boy do they get a whole team of people to work on them. I was SO happy to see that they implemented a workout regimen and counseling which are so much more important than the surgery side. The surgery side makes for a big ""WOW"" moment. As a big fan of reality shows, makeovers, etc. I've been waiting to treat myself to this series for a long time and I'm not disappointed at all in the series.",1468281600,3,1022,4.300518134715026

2608275,2,B000GFRIFE,"Stellar cast, but this movie cannot be recommended as anything but a drama piece. The romance is confusing & unsatisfying . It is not a light hearted movie, but a depressing piece of entertainment.
  Amazon should give better descriptions so that there is a better way to match what you want & what you get ! (also note that Agnes Moorehead plays would have had to be 14 to have given birth to ""son"" Alec Guinness ! )",1452988800,,417,4.333333333333333

2608283,4,B000GFRIFE,"Up through about 7/8 of the movie I thought this was absolutely beautiful (one of my favorites), I would have given this movie a 5 star rating. I guess I don't understand phycology or the phycology of love and people because I didn't like the ending. The story about the swan at the end was supposed to placate an audience but it didn't for me.  I love Grace Kelly and great performances by all just the same.",1438300800,,409,4.311688311688312

2608286,1,B000GFRIFE,"I'll give this show 0 stars if I could but unfortunately That option is unavailable through amazon.com which is such a shame since that's really all the ratings this show deservs, truly.

I think the Question of whether or not you'll enjoy this so called transformation reality based series depends on your moral standards and ethical believes. Do you believe in Plastic surgery? This is the only debate this show presents. The *cast* of the show that consists of a fair amount of professionals from surgeons to a therapiest all somehow make promises to their emotionally wounded participants that a single nose job, and a triple D cup size as well as other untold numbers of all kinds of surgery imaginable to fix a person's look can vanish ALL their life long problems and miracley heal the scars of the past not just the physical once but also the emotional once that they accumulated all their lives. Or is it?

Now, if the contestants in this show were fairly healthy emotionally that is and only looked for an opportunity to fix that nose they never liked or whiten their stained teeth then it's fair to make such a statement and send that kind of message, but when those women that you're working with not only had a rough life but suffer from extremely low self esteem, possible body morphia, anxiety, some form of personality disorder and most of all depression then do you truly believe that getting a hot body and a new face is going to reinvent them completely? Shouldn't you start from the source of these issues instead of going the easy way round and picking the most shallow, superficial solution in the planet? Is that what's considered beauty nowadays?

And if such a terrible ideology wasn't bad enough the representation is even worse! This show has no class whatsoever and is incredibly tacky. The cast doesn't involve one likable character even the therapist who is awful at her job they are all shallow and somehow believe that just because every celeb is getting plastic surgery nowadays normal people should follow in their footsteps. The surgeons just want to be recognized and advertise their work to draw more attention to them and gain possible customers who are willing to pay thousands of dollars for a new face, and the participants are just victims in their ploy who got taken advantage of.

The sad thing is that none of them were THAT ugly to begin with, by exercising and eating healthy as well as going to therapy in order to get over their low self esteem and issues in their lives and makeup would've made them physically attractive in a healthier manner. Most of them aren't even doing it to please themselves but to please their husbands and somehow save the relationship. Loving yourself is the key to all success and progression if those women hated themselves so much I don't think a mere 3 months of weekly therapy that probably only lasts for An hour if not less is going to solve anything. Ironically they all end up looking similar except for the Hispanic contestants and those from African American origin because they're being *molded* by the same creators. Where is the uniqueness in that?

So yeah, I think this show has made a transformation no doubt about that, but is it for the better?",1345075200,,3241,4.708994708994709
2608287,3,B000GFRIFE,"What happens when women with low self esteem think that by sucking out some fat and adding breasts and hair extensions will fix who they are? This show was an embarrassment to women, I liked it but I shouldn't have. Ugly women trying to fix who they were by covering it up wwith makeup and then sticking these poor mud-ducks in a pagent ( what have we become?)I'm so glad that this show was taken off then air, but I'm happy to have it on DVD!",1293753600,,443,4.162790697674419

8131536,4,B000GFRIFE,"This is not normally my favorite cup of tea and I really got it to see Grace Kelly with a sword(and yes she does look well with it, alas in a practice session). It is a subtle deconstruction of the vanity of status, that manages to avoid dehumanizing the people involved. Not that it let's them off the hook-Alexandra's mother Beatrix, is despicable to be sure, and other characters are hardly perfect. But they are in the end mostly caught up in the circumstances they are in. But they are human sins. Beatrix is a scheming rascal who abuses a servant's feelings for the sake of kin politics which were by then laughably obsolete when even the most autocratic monarchs were just figureheads in bureaucratic machines. But being behind the times is not cruel. Being cruel is. When she eats servants stand behind the table doing nothing but serving as human statues and it is obvious this petty exiled court is run by people who only think themselves truly human. That said the movie does not beat you over the head with moralizing. Instead it shows the tragedy of the whole thing. Except for Beatrix the characters are not hateful, just sad. The character's misdeeds are their own punishment. And even Beatrix however cruel is ultimately just a scheming old women. As a breath of relief there are two wholly admirable characters, the Professor and the Priest. Someone or other said that the movie is about ""keeping one's place"". It is not, though if it were that might not be so bad(modern American cinema sometimes makes the opposite error to Central Europeans of the time and glorifies assertiveness without allowing for responsibility). What the movie was about is what happens when everyone in fact is keeping their place except a snob who is overambitious upward, contemptuous toward underlings, and uses her daughter as a tool in despite of her daughter's own conscience.",1514678400,,1876,4.829192546583851

8131539,5,B000GFRIFE,"I don't watch TV. I find it so hard to find a show worth watching, but this show I can watch all the way through every few years. The show attempted to make ""average"" women more beautiful inside and out, and I thought that general goal was achieved. Some viewers were offended by the ""reality"" of this show; The fact that cosmetic procedures generally work at improving a person's appearance should not really be such a taboo. I am sure some people would find this show quite strange, but I found it inspirational. The women were doing something amazing and positive. I would watch it as I ran on the treadmill and it worked very well for that.",1480982400,,644,4.466101694915254

8131543,2,B000GFRIFE,"I didn't like this movie. In the end, the message seemed to be that everyone should keep to his/her place in society and the young princess should be satisfied with having a respected role to play in a powerful family vice a happy marriage. If this had been a historical film about pre-WW1 nobility, that would have been fine. But this is supposed to be a heartwarming story. (I hope Grace Kelly's actual married life was much happier than this fictional one would seem to have been.)",1468540800,,484,4.574712643678161
