8568637,5,B00BHO0P5S,"I was actually at Schoolkids Records the day they were shooting one of the scenes. It was a cold February Sunday afternoon in 1996 and Bill Daly who now owns Crooked Beat Records in Alexandria, VA and formerly in Adams Morgan in Washington DC was working. I stopped in to both shop and talk to him. You can see him in an overhead shot of the store when the scene in Schoolkids begins. He's wearing khaki pants and putting cassettes tapes out for sale!",1471478400,,451,4.380952380952381
8568638,5,B00BHO0P5S,"This review is about the physical item of the movie; not the movie plot.  This is the first time this movie has been made available in a digital format anywhere other than a Region-3 DVD apparent bootleg from Thailand popping up on eBay every now and then.  It is a MOR (Manufactured on Request); meaning it's a DVD-R burnt copy of the newly digitized film.  The DVD is recorded in 4K quality; which is awesome.  However, a reminder must be made that the original source material for this movie is analog film from 1996 and was produced as an independent film.  So, with that reminder, don't expect eye-popping clarity from this kind of original source.
  The quality of the transfer is very good and there are no issues with pixilation, screen pauses, or wavy bits. Is it a bad quality digital transfer? Absolutely not.  Is it modern theater-to-DVD release image quality?  Also no.  Is it a great improvement from the original VHS tape release?  YES.  I am very pleased with it, but remember that originally it was a low budget indie film made on analog in 1996. There is nothing wrong with the digital transfer; just don't expect Captain America: Civil War Blu-Ray quality.  I am very excited to simply have this item available in a digital format instead of my old VHS copy.
  The sound quality is also impressively updated, clear, and pronounced.  The songs sound crisp and clear, and they left all the background noise (be it engine hums, people chatting, echoes in a garage, etc) when they had them in certain scenes, which really helps drive home the indie film roots and atmosphere of the film.
  Lastly, the packaging itself.  This is a No-Frills item.  The case is standard.  The sleeve is a not entirely crisp rehash of the original VHS cover, with only a simple plot summary of the movie on the back and nothing else.  When inserted into the DVD or Blu-Ray player, the movie simply shows the production company logo, and then immediately starts at the beginning of the film.  There is no DVD menu of any kind.  There are no previews of other films like the VHS had.  There are no extras of any kind.
  What you are buying is simply a DVD quality copy of a longtime out-of-production indie film about a band.  And for that, I am very, very grateful and well pleased with this purchase.  I can now enjoy this movie whenever I want to and can finally retire my old VHS copy that I had to sparingly use so as to not ruin or deteriorate the film.  Well done, and thank you Amazon.",1467072000,5,2487,4.536036036036036

Being a child of the 90s, I often romanticize the decade in my head. I like to convince myself what came out of the 90s was better than anything before or after.  Maybe thats because, if not for Nirvana, Live, Soul Asylum, Rage Against the Machine, Weezer, etc. my existence would have been intolerable.  When I think back to the insanity of my teenage years, I often see myself in my room with my door closed and headphones blaring the sound of understanding sympathy that was not found anywhere else.

I frequently go to Northampton MA with my husband Steve and best friend Meghan because the 90s are still alive there.  Whether its used record stores, local bands, or vintage clothing my youth feels so much closer there than any other place.
My adoration for the decade declared, I feel so cheated that I haven't heard of this movie before.  The only reason I know of it now is a combination of my good taste and OCD.  I was watching Grounded For Life on Netflix and remembered how fond I was of the character Eddie.  My mind working the way it does, I began looking up his filmography and going through the movies I hadnt seen.  I saw a picture for Bandwagon online and Mr. Kevin Corrigan was nice enough to let me know the name of the film.  Thankfully, Amazon had it for purchase.
The movie begins with Charlie (Matthew Hennessey) who works at a music store having the desire to be in his own band.  He befriends Tony (Lee Holmes) who loves to write, sing and play music, but is so shy that he has to go into another room to even play in front of Charlie.  The duo decide to make a band and enlist the help of the very subdued Wynn (Kevin Corrigan) and the unhinged Eric (Steve Parlavecchio).  Together, they become Circus Monkey.
There is a small rivalry of sorts with a hardcore metal band named Spittle.  Spittle gets a contract with Rival Records and one of the members throws it in the face of Circus Monkey.  Charlie too wants a contract and knowing that his band is superior to Spittle, keeps his eye on the prize with the desire to seek out fame.
Soon, a big and mysterious name in the music business Linus Tate (Doug MacMillan) shows up and acts as Circus Monkeys manager.  He warns the group right away that Rival Records aim in signing them would be to alter their image and ultimately their music to fit into the mainstream.  Still the group is un-detoured and though staying with Tate, still desire to make it big.
They start a tour and for the most part things go smoothly, until a girl Tony likes and the object of many of his songs has a thing for Charlie.  The band almost breaks up over it, which pushes Eric over the edge.  As hes trying to reason with Tony and Charlie, he sees a guy going in his van.  Thinking that it may be Chester (Doug McCallie) a man he screwed over in town, he takes out a gun he stole and shoots.  Thankfully, no one was hurt but Wynns beer bottle was the recipient and it shot as Wynn himself was holding it.  When he finds out he was almost killed, he passes out and then after waking up decides hes taking off.  He grabs his fishing line and goes to the water where Tony runs after him and pleads for his return.
After some major discussions and a little bit of police trouble, the group finds its way to their meeting with Rival Records.  In the end, the four guys need to decide if success is worth selling out or if the music holds more value than any contract can offer.
This was a fun movie that Im sad I didn't see when I was younger.  This should definitely have a mainstream release and I wonder why it didnt.  Its sad that Airheads (1994), a dumbed-down movie about a 90s band, is a far more recognized film.  Dont get me wrong, if Airheads was on TV right now, Id watch it.  Its a fun flick, and Ill watch anything with Steve Buscemi in it.  Its just Bandwagon had more heart and a higher level of genuine appreciation for the generation its connecting with.  It was a wonderful hour and a half of nostalgia that Ill be sure to relive again soon.",1434499200,3,4040,4.326693227091633

8568642,4,B00BHO0P5S,"A great movie, with a great soundtrack. I often call it an ""indie"" version of ""That Thing You Do!"" I often recommend it to anyone who plays music, along with ""Spinal Tap"" and the aforementioned ""TTYD!""",1405814400,,201,4.611111111111111
8568643,4,B00BHO0P5S,"I liked this movie the first time I saw it back in the late 1990's. It's about an independent rock band from Raleigh, NC touring the southeast college circuit and the trails and tribulations that come with being in a band and the dynamics of having to get along with each other. There's a cameo of Doug MacMillian from the Connells who is the band's tour manger and mentor.
I would recommend this movie to anyone in a fledgling band out kicking doors down and playing original live music or anyone who likes music in general. If you've been on tour then you'll recognize a lot of the venues the band plays.",1403136000,,606,4.419642857142857
8568644,5,B00BHO0P5S,Based on true story of the Connells band in Raleigh! Kevin Corrigan went on to play character actor in many films! Helen was real sister of original drummer now a writer producer.,1387584000,,179,4.625
8568645,4,B00BHO0P5S,"This is such a fun, quirky little indie film. Anyone who has ever been in a band can relate to it. Oh, and the music is great, too.",1386720000,,131,3.7142857142857144
8568646,4,B00BHO0P5S,"I happen to really like this movie.  Though I haven't gotten around to ordering the DVD yet, I have it recorded on VHS.  I gave it 4 stars based on the fact that the previous review said there is no menu which is a bit of a downer.  But the movie is fantastic.  It really impacted me in college and I certainly related to it.  Anyone who's been in a band can probably relate to this story.  Definitely worth checking out.

Edit:  I forgot to add, the music is awesome in this movie.  It's all original and very catchy.  I still have the soundtrack.",1370304000,,548,4.1826923076923075
