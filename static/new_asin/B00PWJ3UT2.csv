8689546,5,B00PWJ3UT2,"I have seen WWII documentaries on combat in the European and Pacific theaters before.  This feature, however, reached for a level that is usually not explored: testimony from the combatants themselves.  Bob Zimmerman took the time to fully and patiently let each of the veterans interviewed tell their story.
He did not deal solely with descriptions of fighting, but, through his skill as a filmmaker, we came to know each man's story via details of their personal lives; details that served to humanize them.  They are each given depth through their own descriptions of their lives before, during and after this intense conflict.  Bob gives us just enough of this human dimension; he deftly does not overindulge.
Words alone can never fully communicate what real combat is like. Bob conveys more of the intensity than perhaps other films by approaching from a different angle. He allows the viewer to first appreciate each man as an individual thus making the combat appear even more stark, exacting and intense.",1430265600,,1013,5.047904191616767
8689547,5,B00PWJ3UT2,"This excellent DVD tells the story of the Sixth Marine Division's experience in the battle of Okinawa through the eyes of six Marines who were there.  The filmmaker lets them tell their stories, which begin with their induction into the Marine Corps and end with their homecoming after the war.  But the focus is on Okinawa.  Each Marine has something different to say, and they all combine for a moving and fascinating portrayal of the battle.  The interviews, which are the highlight of the film, are supplemented with superb photos and footage of the battle.  It's a beautiful film, very professionally done and better than anything I have seen on the History Channel.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in WWII or the Marine Corps.",1426377600,,748,4.896825396825397
8689548,5,B00PWJ3UT2,"Bob Zimmerman's father made the Okinawa Campaign as a member of Sixth Reconnaissance Company. He would be as proud of his son's effort as his son was of his father's 82 days of battle. There weren't many American ground troops still fighting in World War II except in and around Okinawa Shima, where the Japanese were ready and waiting in the late spring of 1945. Europe still had its problems, but the war was over in that theater. Combat was desultory but continuing on some islands in the Pacific and in the CBI. President Roosevelt was dead, the slaughter house that was Iwo Jima had finally ended in our favor. Okinawa, as it turned out, was the last major ground battle being fought in the war. It began April 1 and ended June 22. It was an Army/ Marine Corps/Navy affair in its essentials. The casualty rate was enormous on both sides. All of the divisions on the line were fighting well by early May. Bob concentrated this film on the Sixth Marine Division  because of his father. The Sixth  Division was on it's way to capturing most of the Island and had broken the linchpin of the major Japanese defensive position by May 18. There was still a long way to go and a lot of casualties ahead for all, but the Division was worthy of a film of it's own. Bob concentrated on recollections of veterans still alive in 2014. Each one had been in the thick of it, most had at least one wound and had something worthwhile to say. The Marines involved may have fought in other battles, but this was the only one the Division, not formed until 1944, fought as an entity: the last Division fighting the last battle of WWII.  They thought it is worth remembering, and so does this reviewer. A good job by all.",1422748800,2,1705,4.440894568690096
8689549,5,B00PWJ3UT2,"The documentary is an exceptionally detailed account of the war in the Pacific by the men who were there.  The trauma of what they experienced is etched into their memories and they recall it in vivid detail.  You can see at times where they are recounting the stories of their time on Okinawa and how it is like a movie playing back in their heads.  They speak to the horrors of war, their personal struggles and their absolute commitment to winning.  God bless these heroes and thanks to them for giving us a real life look into one of the great battles of World War II.",1420156800,2,572,4.367924528301887
