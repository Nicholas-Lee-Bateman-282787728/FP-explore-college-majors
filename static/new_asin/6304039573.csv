7859624,4,6304039573,"For reasons that are difficult to express, I really enjoyed ""Once Before I Die."" The cinematography, shot on location in the Phillippines, was very good as was the cast. The star was the gorgeous Ursula Andress in her prime. There were two Tarzan actors, Jock Mahoney and Ron Ely, and a future Tarzan Director, John Derek, who directed the God-awful ""Tarzan the Ape Man."" Considering my utter contempt for ""Tarzan the Ape Man,"" it might seem strange that I liked Derek's style in ""Once Before I Die."" The techniques he used served the story well and blended myth and reality. The film begins with the depiction of a group of folks playing polo without a care in the world. They are soon surprised to find themselves thrust into the war but they shoulde their responsibilities well. Richard Jaeckel stands out as, Custer, a soldier who enjoys the role of lone warrior a little too much. We see in flashback a scene in which he fights off a whole regiment of Japanese as a one-man army. For a moment, a seasoned commanding officer expresses total doubt about Custer's claims and, for a moment, we, too, believe that Custer is delusional until he wanders out of the bar and returns with proof. It then comes as no surprise when he wages another courageous one-man battle against the Japanese. The Japanese are never portrayed as cruel, amoral, or otherwise evil. We easily empathize with them. A mature viewer will realize that, in war, there is no black and white, that all soldiers are both good and bad on both sides. The story is most unusual but well-executed. This is a quirky and off-beat war film which took place during the Viet Nam war and was, no doubt a commentary on it.  The source of the title is the young soldier who is strongly attracted to Andress' character and feels strongly that he will soon die as a virgin.  It is easy to identify with his plight and his desire to change the situation. I find it a very watchable and likeable film, if a tragic one.",1492560000,,1971,4.580736543909349

In the end, it's just dull in addition to having the requisite bad acting, negligible budget, transparent plotline, and yes, Ursula Andress in a wet dress. But this Porkies meets World War II movie just defies the imagination. Can it really be that bad? Yes, yes, it can.",1262908800,,476,4.534883720930233

7859632,4,6304039573,"Although I'm sure he'll claim he's never seen it, this was actually Francis Ford Coppola's inspiration for Apocalypse Now.  To John Derek's credit this was a story about the P.I filmed in P.I.  Having seen Apocalypse Now first even though Once Before I Die preceeds by decades chronologically puts movie viewers at a distinct disadvantage in being able to identify this as an ""homage"".  When you watch both consecutively you'll see incredible similarities.  The panoramic views and camera angles could have been shot on the same island, right down to the psychedelic ending in Once before I Die's rogue G.I looking very reminiscent of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.  Up until now Coppala has been able to fool some of the people, however I feel time will bring out that Apocalypse Now owes infinitely more to Once Before I Die than to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness if it owes anything to the former at all.  Yes Francis, a few of us have read it.  You don't have to be a huge fan of Naval history to see what a disservice Coppola has done for the portrayal of Nam Vets.  John Derek flirts with the boundaries as well but manages to keep well within bounds.  In time film critics will make this connection as well and ultimately agree that given it's budget and chronology Once Before I Die is the better film.  By the way when you're at the video store make sure you get the copy of Apocalypse Now (Redux) it even has the awkward love scene just like Once Before I Die complete with corny retro romance sound track that was cut from the original release.  I guess Francis thought, ""After all these years, who would remember""?",1086652800,11,1631,4.608996539792387
7859633,4,6304039573,"Once Before I Die is a film I saw on TV around 1980.  The 1965 film directed by and co-starring John Derek is a great vehicle for Ursula Andress who portrays a beautiful sweet naive
Swiss woman stuck in the Philipines during the Japanese attack.
Her character is very meditative about the prospect of everyone around her dying, and she contemplates the request by a 22-year-old soldier to be with a woman ""once before I die"".
  Custer (Ricard Jaeckel) plays the bald gung-ho warrior who provokes the final assault.
  The cinematography uses many stills of Ursula superimposed on all the killing.  Well done original '60s war film and a covert antiwar message during the escalation of Vietnam.",1011830400,13,692,4.871794871794871
