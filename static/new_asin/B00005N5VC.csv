7946345,5,B00005N5VC,"My mother bought this charming movie for my oldest son, when he was a toddler. 15 years later, she asked me to purchase this replacement copy, so that my youngest son can enjoy the magic. , as well.
A sweet, clever tale about overcoming fears, making new friends, being kind to others, and forgiving. The songs are extremely catchy and fun...(believe me, you will be singing along). Characters are very different and interesting...even the ""bad guys"" are likeable. Best of all, is the incredible storytelling ability of Patrick Breen (Galaxy Quest), who does an amazing job voicing all of the characters.
In short, a keeper throughout the years. Even my (now teenage) son still takes time to watch again.",1380844800,,704,4.92436974789916

My daughter learns so much about caring and sharing with others from the adventures Mumfie shares with his friends! In very good condition when we got it.",1232150400,,266,4.804347826086956
7946347,5,B00005N5VC,"My daughter and I have watched this video many times
and are delighted every time.  It's so wonderful to
watch something today that actually promotes goodness
and kindness.  Mumfie is a lovely character who
collects friends wherever he goes..  And also gets
into many misadventures inspite of his goodness.
It's a long film and worth every second.  I
highly recommend and I am a video distributor and
have seem zillions of films...But this is one of my
favorite family/childrens films.",1030579200,,485,5.025
7946348,5,B00005N5VC,I just discovered Mumfie and so glad I did. My girls love this movie to bits. Although they are three and a half year old triplets they have very different taste in what they enjoy watching - this is the only movie I can put on and they all cheer. It's really charming and quite nicely querky.,1021248000,,293,4.157894736842105
7946349,3,B00005N5VC,"This plot weaves magic throughout, touching on loneliness and friendship. The animation and songs are delightful, the characters are darling. Parents should be forewarned that it does contain some aggressive language. Visually it appeals to pre-schoolers, but the plot is geared for children five to eight. Our kids were mesmerized by it! Surprisingly, even though it's a bit long, kids became very involved in the story, the characters and the outcome. There is never a dull moment. The kids wanted to watch it again. KIDS FIRST! recommends it for 4 to 8-year-olds.",1000166400,3,566,5.163043478260869
