2942127,1,B000VI70UO,"This is a taped vinyasa taught to other students in a hotel, Seane walks around with a mic...no music and barks at people to tell them whether pose is good or not. I was surprised...not what I expected",1297382400,,201,4.315789473684211
2942128,5,B000VI70UO,She is just a breath of fresh air. This makes you want to take a workshop with her. She is the most enthusiastic teacher that I have ever known. Her energy reaches through this video. Thank you Yoga Journal for this great gift. Every yogi should have this video.,1287446400,,262,4.36734693877551
2942129,5,B000VI70UO,"I was there,(and on camera.)  This DVD is filmed live at a Yoga Journal Conference, so it will not be anything like a smooth, glossy DVD filmed in a studio, with fancy editing and sound.  There are plenty of those out there.  This DVD is meant to allow people a taste of a class at a conference. The live experience was absolutely amazing, and one of the best classes I have attended at the 5 Yoga Journal Conferences I have been to so far. Seane is a very spiritual, knowlegeable, sincere yoga instructor and the class was a ""body prayer."" And it was also a very strong asana practice. (especially after 2 days of asana at a conference!) Yoga is about more than just the ""workout"", something that is prevalent in most other DVD's.

At the end of the class, the gal next to me said, ""Oh my god, that was the best class I have ever taken!"" The room was electric with love and calm bliss!

If you want a taste of Seane's heart and an experience of a Yoga Journal conference class with her, then this is the DVD for you.",1282176000,,1017,4.248704663212435
2942130,5,B000VI70UO,"I've wanted to take Seane Corn class since I've heard her interview in iTunes.
She is amazing! The class is AMAZING!
It is very inspiring, and provides not only a good class with lots of alignment, but offers 'emotional' workout as well.
for example, Seane asks you to put a meaning, an intention to every movement. It is so much easier to move with the intention to make future of our children better than with the intention to forgive those who hurt us!
VERY mindful yoga class. Safe, with clear explanations, and REAL. You can feel Seane's energy, even though it's just a recorded class. So much for one DVD!",1259193600,,611,4.5636363636363635
2942131,5,B000VI70UO,"Thanks so much for sending this DVD so quickly and in such great shape. I love it. It so adds to my joy. Namaste, Karen",1251244800,,119,3.8
2942132,5,B000VI70UO,"I have done Seane's beginning yoga dvd, and this one makes me strive!  I am not like one of her beautiful California students in the video, but I work hard, do my best, and I never cease to find Seane's videos to be just as good as being in a class.  I always feel happier and more at peace with myself and the world from working out with her and listening to her, and isn't that the purpose?",1247011200,,392,4.012820512820513
2942133,3,B000VI70UO,"1. Seane talks too much.
2. It is hard to follow the poses since they stay in one pose for too long, then move through a couple of poses fast. It doesn't have a feeling of ""flow"".
3. The room/background is ugly.
4. People struggle for space to do poses, and then they start to laugh etc, that is way too distracting for someone who is trying to enjoy the practice.
5. Not many different poses, repetitive.",1242172800,,405,4.2727272727272725
2942134,5,B000VI70UO,"This DVD really brings out Seane Corn's best. She leaves you feeling as though you been to a spiritual seminar while going through a nice flow sequence. I feel it is good for beginner as well as intermediate to advanced practitioners. I do have Seane Corn's other Yoga DVD, which I found lacking. In fact I've only watched it two times in four years. So I was very happy to find a DVD that shows you how good of a teacher she really is.",1240012800,,436,4.2023809523809526
2942135,5,B000VI70UO,"I love this DVD.  Seane takes you through each pose with precision.  You can do the entire DVD or pick certain chapters.  It doesn't feel like a workout but the next day you do feel that your body had a workout.  What I like about the DVD is Seane explains as your doing the poses that yoga isn't just physcial.  It works on releasing your emotions that are deep in your tissues. Yoga releases the trapped emotions and helps you work with them.  The DVD explains and demonstrates yoga is for the mind, body and spirit.  Spirit is when you reconize (re-member) that we are all one in spirit.  Sometimes you have to slow down on your practice and give precision of alignment a chance and the result will come much more than a rigid yoga exercise routine.",1214265600,,752,4.398550724637682
2942136,5,B000VI70UO,"As a fan of Seane Corn I may be a bit bias, however, I think this is a great workout with detailed instruction.  It is in a class setting and challenging.  I would suggest mastering her 2 other DVD's before doing this one.",1212537600,,222,4.1395348837209305
2942137,1,B000VI70UO,"Vinyasa flow was never so disjointed as this overly talkative, poorly timed DVD portrays via Seane Corn. Her uneven approach largely tinged with an enormous ego, we find little sincerity in her dramatic vocals. If you are looking for something to enhance home practice, borrow this DVD from the library, a mere example of Vinyasa session, not a technique teaching tool. We found her voice grating, the camera follows Corne rather than narrowing in on positions and flow. How any of these followers managed to meditate with the endless ramblings of Corn is beyond our patience. Try Kundalini with Ana Brett for excellent music, active Yoga, breathing techniques, wondrous meditation......",1206489600,,687,5.254545454545455
2942138,5,B000VI70UO,"Seane is great, I have had her many times at conferences, so this was just like being there.",1206489600,,92,4.166666666666667
2942139,3,B000VI70UO,"I, like one of the above reviewers, had not experienced a Seane Corn video or class prior to purchasing this one.  I was surprised at how different her style is than I'd expected.  I found her instruction helpful and the meaning she gives to each movement, each breath, inspiring.  However, because I am accustomed to practicing in a very meditative way, I found her style of delivery and tone of voice to be somewhat intense, and therefore, distracting.  I suppose I am better suited to a Kripalu-style class and instructor.  (I did not, however, have the same reaction to the Baron Baptiste or the Shiva Rae classes in this series.  I found their voices and delivery very conducive to my meditative practice, even where poses and sequences got relatively vigorous.)  I am sure that my reaction to Ms. Corn's delivery is peculiar to me, and that most people will find her and this video inspiring and helpful.",1197417600,,910,4.75796178343949
2942140,4,B000VI70UO,"""Yoga from the Heart"" is part of Yoga Journal's Great Instructors series, a series of DVDs filmed at the annual Yoga Journal Conference in San Francisco.  It features Seane Corn, a nationally known vinyasa yoga instructor whose teachings focus on both the physical and the spiritual aspects of the yoga practice.  Here she presents a 90-minute vinyasa class which combines demanding vinyasa sequences, detailed alignment instruction, and frequent references to spirituality in the form of God, love for self, and love for others.  As she guides her students through the practice, Seane frequently asks the participants to set an intent, constantly bringing an element of meaning to the practice.  She sometimes performs the poses herself, sometimes walks around the class providing adjustments (along with an assistant); there is also a ""yoga demonstrator"" at the head of the class for reference.

This DVD is well-chaptered, and the introduction suggests that each chapter can stand alone as a shorter practice if necessary.  The chapters are as listed below; I have added in approximate times as well as brief descriptive information.

Surya Namaskar A (11m)--Seane opens with a dedication and a discussion of the world around us; the sun salutation flow begins in down dog and includes some longer holds of this posture.
Surya Namaskar B (14m)--Seane stresses the importance of building postures ""from the ground up""; the last round of each sun salutation segment are performed at your own pace.
Standing Poses (8m)--This segment has a strong shoulder emphasis and includes warrior 1, wide-legged forward bend with eagle arms, and finishes with a side stretch.
Shoulder Openers (4m)--Additional shoulder work with side plank and dolphin variations.
Spine Openers (10m)--This twisting segment includes wide legged standing forward bend with twist, intense side stretch, revolved triangle, and revolved crescent pose.
Hip Openers (9m)--Standing hip work includes warrior 2, side angle, and wide legged standing forward bend.
Back Openers (9m)--Starts with camel (3x) and then moves to the floor for either bridge or wheel (3x).
Final Relaxation (10m)--Poses include reclined twist, dead bug, dead pigeon (aka thread the needle), cobbler's pose (held for some time while Seane talks), and full seated forward bend.
Meditation (10m)--Here the class remains seated while Seane continues to discuss various spiritual-type issues; ends with a short (4m) savasana. Following this, the DVD moves right on to the Guided Medication described below, so you can seamlessly continue if desired.

The Main Menu on the DVD lists a Play All option, an Introduction, Chapters, and Special Features.  The Special Features include the following:  Introduction to Body Prayer (23m), Guided Meditation (9m), Interview with Seane (10m), and Yoga Journal advertisements.  The Body Prayer segment consists of Seane further discussing the mind-body connection, offering a brief demonstration, and then finishing with a musician who provides a singing meditation; the Guided Meditation is similar but with the entire segment being a singing meditation.  Finally, in the Interview, Seane talks about how she came to yoga in 1987 at the age of 17 and how her yoga practice gradually came to permeate every aspect of her life.

Overall, this is a challenging vinyasa practice that is probably best suited for experienced yoga students.  Seane does show some modifications, and she frequently encourages the participants to modify as appropriate for their own needs.  However, the class is quite vigorous, and it demands both strength and stamina.  This DVD is likely to appeal to those who enjoy the vinyasa style and who prefer to practice with a deep emphasis on meaning and intention.",1196294400,,3760,5.401709401709402
2942141,5,B000VI70UO,"This is the 2nd dvd in the great teachers package that I did this morning.  Seane describes this practice as ""Body Prayer"" .  I want to say right off the top if you have never taken a Seane Corn class or used her dvds,(like me), you may be quite surprised by the paradox that is this young lady.  She is not just another Southern Calif. yogini with a pretty face, but comes across as a very intelligent, compassionate and passionate person who trully believes that the purpose of yoga is to make us better people so that we can love ourselves and in turn love and serve the world. She also walks the talk as she works with YouthAIDS and has recieved an humanitarian award. I'm not her advocate, I thought I'd just share those thoughts with you because the entire class is centered around the themes of love, service and forgiveness.  If the words prayer and God make you run screaming from a yoga class, then this is NOT the tape for you.  Seane says that every pose and every breath is a prayer. The dvd has the following:

Special features:  Intention setting lecture by Seane about social and personal responsibility.  Mediatation with a young woman singing and playing the harmonium.  She has an earthy, soulful voice.

The poses are if memory serves me:

*Sun salutes A & B with an intention set for each salute done on your own.
*warriors 1 with arms clasped behind back
*wide legged forward bend with hands clasped, arms in cow face, grabbing big toes, one arm up twisting.  (not necessarily in this order)
*side angle
*side plank
*reverse triangle
*crescent lunge prayer twist.
*camel 3x
*upper facing bow 3x
*happy baby
*reclining pigeon
*butterfly pose held for a long time
*seated forward bend
*seated meditation.

In between some of the poses, Seane has you sit or stand in prayer.  The other special feature is a closing mantra meditation with the harmonium singer again.

This slow flow vinyasa class is for everyone.  It is basic with an emphasis on alignment.  The hardest pose is upward facing bow.  This is trully a yoga class with lots of spirituality infused throughout.  Seane talks (preaches) alot and says God alot which does not bother me at all but may bother some. I felt refreshed after the class and look forward to doing it again. As a caveat, for those of you who practice kundalini yoga as your main sadhana (like me), this type of yoga is a perfect compliment as she emphasizes that we are all interconnected and it is our birth right to be bountiful, beautiful and blissful.",1195516800,,2507,4.618510158013544
2942142,5,B000VI70UO,"Seane at her best!! Live, relational and as genuine as can be. I have followed Seane's teaching and growth as a teacher and spiritual leader for years now. She 'walks the talk' and is what yoga is all about. Authenticity and compassion. Untrapped by her celebrity - she uses her platform to make a difference in the world by taking yoga ""Off the Mat and Into the World"". A truly gifted and extremely intelligent spirit. This DVD make for wonderful home practice. Integrates the beauty of the vinyasa practice with a wonderful sense of spirituality.

A must have! Out of 5 stars - I give it 10!!!!",1195257600,,596,4.570093457943925
2942143,5,B000VI70UO,"You can feel Seane Corn's spirit shine through.  She is so authentic and truly represents what Yoga is all about.  She reviews alignment principles and is shown correcting some students ,  which I found particularly useful as a teacher.

I would love to attend one of her live workshop's.  Right now she is my favorite teacher to watch on DVD.  What a treat it must be to have her as a teacher.

I can't wait to try more of her DVD's.  I also love her original DVD's,  and learn so much from her.

She truly teaches from the Heart,  and I would never question her motivation for teaching.",1194480000,,588,4.351851851851852
8218828,3,B000VI70UO,"Very thorough, and she's beautiful",1477958400,,34,6.0
8218829,4,B000VI70UO,"I just love yoga with Seane Corn, this is a great class however the audio is not great.  It starts very quiet then gets louder, and when she speaks it  sounds slightly muted.",1423785600,,174,4.242424242424242
8218830,3,B000VI70UO,Her technique and teaching style combine the movement and breath perfectly and this is so helpful!  But all of her commentary throughout the practice was not appealing to me.  I am on a very specific journey with my practice and her constant interjecting what I should be thinking about from a spiritual perspective was distracting to me.  My spiritual journey with this practice for me is about finding a piece of myself and I found it difficult to meditate on my own mantra.,1410998400,,476,4.710843373493976
8218831,1,B000VI70UO,"As other reviewers mention, the tone of this DVD is rough and harsh. I would more appropriately call it militaristic in tone. The tone clashes big time with the subject matter. It is incompatible with my style of yoga which is not fast paced and more contemplative. But to each his or her own. If your vision of yoga is being bossed around by some kind of new age drill sergeant, you may like this.",1385856000,,398,4.32
8218832,5,B000VI70UO,"Very motivating.  I have attended classes at this conference, and it is different than going to class at a regular studio, or home practice.  There is a collective soul when a large group of yogis get together, and that collective soul is felt when using this video.  Seane Corn is awesome.  Down to earth, motivating.  You can feel the love.  Peace out!",1384646400,,354,4.629032258064516
8218833,1,B000VI70UO,"If you're looking for a blissful yoga experience, this DVD is not it. I was excited to try a Seane Corn workout because I've read so many positive things about her as a teacher, but I'm not seeing it. I'm used to instructors like Ana Brett, Rodney Yee, Lee Holden, and Gary Kraftsow, who talk minimally and have a gentleness about them. Seane Corn was talking constantly in this DVD and her voice is, well, gruff. It would have been nice if she just simply explained in as few words as possible what movement to do. All the extra chit-chat was distracting and had me tensing up.

Also, Seane Corn wasn't doing the poses with her students. She and assistants went around the room, correcting postures, but I'd prefer an instructor do the poses with the class. I know that everyone's pose can be different looking, but I still want to see what a skilled instructor's poses look like versus a student's.",1384560000,,900,4.555555555555555
8218834,3,B000VI70UO,"Seane Corn, or the producers of this video, have titled it ""Yoga from the Heart,"" and I can see why. She is clearly passionate about her yoga and, especially, about her spiritual connection to it, and she very much wants to draw you into that.

On top of that, I have no doubt that she is a good teacher. She offers some really good pointers here, such as how to align your hips properly before doing a reverse triangle. I had never been shown that before, and it definitely felt good once I'd made that adjustment. I also felt relatively sore the next day--not seriously so, but enough to suggest that I'd done a good session of yoga. And for somebody who exercises rigorously almost daily and practices yoga at least a couple of times a week, that made an impression on me.

The problem--and I see I'm not the first to have pointed this out--is that she simply talks too much during the session. As I said, I do admire her passion, but I find there are several times during this routine when I really wish she would either stop talking completely or guide us more on the poses we are doing, rather than on her spiritual beliefs.

And please don't get me wrong. I like that she's a positive person, and I agree with a lot of the message that she's trying to spread. Some other reviewers obviously feel the same. But to me, it really gets to the point of overkill at a few different times during the session--and whenever that happens, I feel more like I'm being preached to than guided, and I find myself wishing the teacher would simply tone it down and let the class focus on our poses, our breathing and our own thoughts.

Again, let me emphasize that I do think spiritual guidance is important. But in yoga, physical guidance is also important. And for my taste, there's simply not enough balance between the two in this video to make me a fan.",1379894400,,1849,4.413489736070381
8218835,4,B000VI70UO,"If you're looking for a quick yoga workout, this is not it.  with that being said, I adore Seane Corn and her yoga routines are some of my favorites.  If you have the time, you're looking for a great workout with long held poses, I think you will really like this one.",1355443200,,268,4.134615384615385
8218836,5,B000VI70UO,"This practice moves at a nice pace, not too quick, not too slow, and provides an excellent physical workout. I personally really enjoy the spiritual aspects of the guidance for ""practice as ritual,"" even though I'm not a religious person. She mentions 'god' a few times, but generally in reference to whatever energy or sense of the divine you want to make it, and she particularly directs the viewer towards a sense of the spiritual that is more an interconnectedness with others on the planet--a higher sense of compassion. Corn is a brilliant guru in my book, with a great sense of humor that comes through on this practice. This is one DVD I will always keep in the library and will come back to again and again.",1332201600,,716,4.6015625
8218837,5,B000VI70UO,"I have been practicing yoga for over ten years.  My favorite instructors include Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, Sarah Ivanhoe and Seane Corne.  I love this video so much because Seane really breaks down the proper technique for each pose--something even a veteran like me really loved.  I also enjoy holding the poses for longer periods than usual and really focusing on form and breath.  I also appreciated Seane's emphasis on the spiritual!  I usually do 45 minutes of this video one morning and the second half the following morning.  I find that I can still hear Seane's voice now even when I am practicing with other instructors.  I would recommend this to all levels of yogis!",1301875200,,675,4.767241379310345
