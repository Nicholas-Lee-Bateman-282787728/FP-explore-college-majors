8334963,5,B001Q3B2U2,"This  is a brilliantly filmed account of the trial and condemnation of the great writer and cosmologist Giordano Bruno.  The color and perfomances are exceptional.  Bruno is shown to have an affair with a prostitute, Charlotte Rampling; one of the reasons for his trial and incarceration.  Bruno was thought to be homosexual but no mention is made of that.  There is a complexity shown in the in the trial in that many prelates who admire the many books and personality of the scientist try to defend him and advise he appologize for his openly blasphemous words and books; he refuses.  Galileo only a few years later confessed his faults and was let off scot-free.  The young Volonte' is exceptionally handsome and displays a phenomenal body in the torture scenes.  His acting as always is great.  I am very familiar with the statue of Bruno in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on the spot where he was actually burnt at the stake.  It houses fruit and flower stalls and several restaurants, one of which is one of the best in Rome. At a 90-degree angle to the restaurant is the French Embassy which houses one of Rafael Sanzio's greatest paintings.  It requres a week's wait before being let in; I managed somehow to avoid the wait. Though the subtitles are only in Italian the pictures tell the story without their help.  A friend who knows no Italian said as much.  I'll be seeing this film over and over again not only to improve my Italian and because the story is so moving.  I have ordered a couple of bios of Bruno which should arrive soon.  Thank you, Amazon!",1470096000,,1564,4.575539568345324

The film shows us the process due a denounce of Giovanni Moscherigo who gives him in silver stray the free-thinker to the authorities..

Memorable cinematography and fabulous cast (the alluring Charlotte Rampling) make the rest.

Don't miss it. The film dates from 1973 and Montalvo is the same director of Sacco and Vanzetti.",1410652800,2,512,5.071428571428571
