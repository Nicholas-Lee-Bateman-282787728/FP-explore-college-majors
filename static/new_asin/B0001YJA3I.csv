8309918,3,B0001YJA3I,"The title of this video is likely to turn some people off, but it's actually a half-decent yoga program focused mainly on strengthening your core muscles (or ""inner sexual core"" as it's referred to in the video). The practice begins with several series of sun salutations, adding 3-legged dog, pigeon, and warrior poses to make each series quite challenging (14 minutes total). Next comes 8 minutes of standing postures. This section begins with simple, dance-y hip rolls and stretches then moves on to balancing postures and forward bends, including an extended wide-legged forward bend. The longest segment of the video is the floor work (19 minutes). You will start on your stomach for locust and then flip over to your back for a challenging table/boat series. Also in this series are lying twists, bridge pose, and seated forward bends. Following this, you will do core abs work which includes a pelvic lift series performed with the legs in 3 different positions. Finally, there are some challenging reclined stretches (eg, reclined hero's pose), and then the practice ends with a 4-minute lying guided relaxation, bringing in the total time at just under 40 minutes.

I liked this practice's focus on engaging your ""sexual inner core"" muscles. Although this is not all that different from engaging your abdominals in other yoga videos, I found the near-constant reminders to be both important and beneficial. Instructor Jacquie Noelle provided good, non-mirrored cuing, but because the overall sound quality was below average, as it was often difficult to hear her instruction. The video also includes occasional on-screen written instruction, but I found that most of the time, I was not in a position to see the TV when these pointers appeared. Finally, I should note this video was not nearly as erotic as the title would suggest. First of all, Jacquie is dressed as erotically as she is on the video cover: during most of the practice, she wears blue satin shorts and a white baby t-shirt, although she later removes the latter to reveal a tank top underneath. The music, which includes slight moaning sounds at times, was a bit more obviously sexual; I barely noticed the music, but it might bother others.

This is definitely an intermediate practice, as Jacquie provides little instruction on how to perform the poses and no modifications are given. More traditional yoga devotees will probably not like this one; I soon tired of it myself, mostly because there are much better options available. However, if you have some prior experience with yoga and are looking for a practice with a different, more modern feel, this video might be a good match.",1174521600,,2664,5.011286681715576

8309921,5,B0001YJA3I,"Jacquie Noelle is probably the sexiest Yoga instructor I've ever seen and her personality makes her workouts some of the most enjoyable yoga workouts I've tried.

In this workout, she is wearing blue shorts and a white shirt. She changes to a black top later in the workout. Jacquie has two partners in this workout who are equally fit and flexible.

The bare wood floor and sheer drapes covering the window are the basics of the set. Then, you have some plants and lots of candles. You sort of feel that you are in a dance studio and so there is a realistic feel to the entire workout and you feel like you are part of a yoga class.

The music for these workouts is very sexy and encourages you to keep moving through the various poses. You can wear anything you want to wear, the sexier the better. I dress up when doing these workouts and normally like wearing black short shorts and a tight top because that way you can do all the exercises without your clothes limiting you in any way.

There is one scene that could be considered a short dance. It will loosen your hips and make you feel so relaxed. You start with basic neck stretches and make your way to forward stretches and then shoulder rolls, down dog, creative hip stretches, an amazingly creative upside down stretch, warrior, triangle pose, fun-sexy-hip swirls, isolated hip rolls, primitive dance-style forward rolls, challenging balancing poses, deep leg stretches, back exercises, table, sexy side stretches, creative stomach exercises, Pilates exercises, sitting forward bends, challenging knee stretches, creative series of pelvic exercises and a final relaxation segment that you will really deserve!

Throughout this workout, the instructor teaches sensual and graceful yoga moves beyond upward or downward dog. Jacquie teaches a variety of yoga poses, but also includes some Pilates moves. I was so excited that I finally made it all the way to the complete table pose. Quite a few of the poses were a nice challenge and there are some stretches that will be a challenge for quite some time.

You will also learn some essential:

Breathing techniques
Pelvic Stretches
Inner-core strengtheners
Body-enhancement positions

What did I notice after exercising?

1. From the minute I stood up and walked off my mat, my hips seemed more flexible and I was walking in a much more sexy way.

2. I felt like I had more energy and was much more aware of my body.

3. I felt that my body had warmed and this workout in particular made my skin feel softer. I think the Intermediate workout is slightly more challenging and my blood flow had been significantly increased.

4. I handled everything with a calm spirit. Nothing seemed too complex. I had been stressed before starting the workout and after the workout, everything seemed more ""in control."" I think this is one of the main benefits of yoga.

5. There was a definite increase in how sexy I felt and if you are looking to increase your sex drive, this workout can almost be considered a workout aphrodisiac.

6. Much flatter stomach, wow. I was impressed.

7. A desire to eat exotic fruit dipped in a mixture of sour cream, sweetener of choice and vanilla extract.

8. A desire to look in mirror to see my improved posture.

9. A desire to dress sexier and buy sexier clothes.

10. The need to buy every Better Through Yoga Workout that is ever produced. They work!

Some of the Special Features Include:

1. Jacquie Introduction - This section explains how increased Strength, Flexibility and Control leads to sexual fitness. This explains how these exercises will help you ""get into"" and ""hold"" new and exciting positions. I think we are talking about Kama Sutra here, but the muscles you are working are definitely ones you want to work on if you want a more exciting sex life.

2. Additional Instruction
Yoga Poses - This is an almost ""silent"" section you can watch that shows a variety of poses with notes on proper form. You have to hit pause to read each one as they move through the poses rather fast. You will learn the names of the poses and this will be helpful for anyone new to yoga. This is the section to watch to understand the ""sexual core"" exercises.

4. Out-Takes and Bloopers - This is a fun section where the crew just has fun, Garvey is seen laughing and Alex tries to juggle limes. It is nice to see how the workouts are made.

""Better Sex Through Yoga 2"" is an exciting workout designed to increase your body awareness all while seducing you into a new level of sexual fitness. There are a lot of yoga workouts out there, but nothing will make you feel as sexy as the ""Better Sex Through Yoga"" series.

8309922,3,B0001YJA3I,"For anyone who practices yoga regularly, BSTY vol. 2 provides a light, fun workout for ""off"" days. The production value is low (home movies) and it can be difficult to hear the instructor at times. The music is a bit imposing at first but not overly distracting once you become engaged in the workout. The entire workout runs approximately 40 minutes (~25 min. of floorwork, including 5 minutes of guided relaxation at the end) Outside of a few cheesy tones and a couple of references to the ""sexual core"", the program is fairly tame. A beginner could work up to this program fairly quickly. Experienced yoga practitioners might want to start with volume 3. Though there is not a lot of detailed instruction during the workout, the special feature section offers more guidance on the poses. All in all, a solid workout that targets the ab/pelvic muscles.",1094688000,,854,4.816326530612245
8309923,2,B0001YJA3I,"I was not impressed by this tape.  The bad camera work (done on a home video with bad audio and picture) combined with the cheesy music and disgusting butt and crotch shots were completely annoying.  Not to mention that they spelled ""waste"" instead of ""waist"" and ""heal"" instead of ""heel"" during the workout!!
Unfortunately, the good workout was hindered by all these aspects.  Hopefully I'll memorize it soon so I don't have to look at the tape again.  I even emailed the company because I feel the lack of effort they put into the tape disrespects the consumer.  The teacher even smiled and shyly waved at someone off camera!!
I wouldn't buy any other tape from this company, which is a shame because I do enjoy the actual workout.",1088467200,,733,4.651162790697675
8309924,5,B0001YJA3I,"The workout is great.  It provides a new and fresh slant to yoga.  The 'Better Sex' is an interesting angle, but this is a GREAT yoga tape on its own.",1066780800,,150,3.966666666666667
8309925,5,B0001YJA3I,"Jaquie Rules!!!!
I did BSTY 1, now did 2. They just get better. They are a challenge, but totally worth it!
It was  FUN, and not boring.  I still felt great like I normally do after yoga, but even better. I felt calm, centered...AND ..I felt sexy.
My boyfriend loves watching me do the video.
It works.
I highly recommend!",1064361600,,322,4.35
8309926,4,B0001YJA3I,"I'm fairly new to yoga and have been concentrating on relaxation, stress release and conditioning. I want to try new areas of yoga- and this has turned out to be a fun place to start. The video is up beat and fairly quick, you do not stay in one pose for long, but repeat a series of poses strung together. The video looks like it takes place in a studio, and although the routine is enjoyable the sound is horribe, the room has an echoing effect which makes the voices muffled. The Editors really should have done something about it. You can't understand the instructions and it becomes frustrating when you have to keep glancing up at the television and as a result you can't keep up with the moves, or you lose your balance. Another thing I didn't like was how the camera kept zooming into the instructor's bottom- it was tacky. Her shorts were really short so you saw more than was necessary and it did not help you with the move she was doing. Although the video is ment to be fun that was just plain unprofessional, which is a shame because the instructors otherwise did a really good job.
I would recommend this video for someone who wants a light fun yoga experience, but definately watch the video through once first to get the routines down and read the proper ways to do the poses (they don't verbally tell you, it's written on the screen.)",1063324800,,1351,4.429718875502008
8309927,5,B0001YJA3I,"I got an advanced copy of this video, and jumped here to order one for a friend, but they are on back order... I wanted to get it for her birthday!!  Bummer!!
This workout is SOOO much fun. I felt so sexy and confident after doing it.  It's not your typical spiritual, environmental-music type yoga routine at all.  It was fun - a great workout - the music is great, and most importantly - IT WORKS!  My hips were looser, my abs were more supportive and strong, and I was breathing better and deeper into the ""sexual inner-core"" - which is what they refer to your pelvic region as.
... NO - I didn't drop 10 pounds in two days. BUT - I felt different.  Better than after doing my cardio workout tapes, or pilates tapes.  I felt refreshed, wide-eyed, flexible, and strong.  I felt great in my dress that night.  It was so much fun to test out the results after doing the tape a few times.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these tapes. ...",1049673600,,923,4.264367816091954
