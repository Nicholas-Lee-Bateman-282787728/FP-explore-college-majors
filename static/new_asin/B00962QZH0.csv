8536464,5,B00962QZH0,It's a great documentation of the lengths people should go for the earth. I feel like it was a precursor to what we saw in North Dakota in 2016-2017 as well as the fights that are happening all over to stop corporations from the further destruction and abuse of the natural resources creation gave us to protect.,1515456000,,312,4.491228070175438
8536465,4,B00962QZH0,"I love this movie because it reminds us that even in a tropical paradise like PR, the forces of greed and corruption threaten entire communities and the only way to be secure is to be organized. I'm glad this story is being told. It helps us to see that the need to protect our environment and our humane way of life exists all the time, everywhere.",1394928000,,349,4.303030303030303

I was nor aware of the issue of beach access. I would have appreciated an analysis in more depth, but i support their campaign.",1368489600,,270,4.211538461538462
8536467,5,B00962QZH0,"""Companeros de Lucha"" tells a little-known story of a resistance group of environmentalists that have spent close to a decade camped out on public beach land in order to prevent the Courtyard Marriott from unlawfully expanding. This is director Juan Carlos Davila's first documentary effort, which means that the finished film shows some rough edges. It also shows plenty of promise for the rest of Davila's career, especially in his ability to discover and expand upon little know character studies from the fringes of Puerto Rican society. The documentary has a fine structure, making it easily accessible to those who have no prior knowledge of the conflict between the ""Playas Pal' Pueblo"" resistance camp and the Marriott. The characters that are interviewed for this film are engaging enough, always informing while keeping the audience's attention.

Davila gives us a peek inside the lives of those that have dedicated over 7 years to living in the camp full time, and their methods of surviving against the weather and government intrusion is fascinating. Not only have they been able to survive for almost a decade, but they have been able to thrive by growing fruits and vegetables in a large communal garden and engage the community with different workshops. Davila has done a fine job chronicling  the impact that this camp has had on other environmentalists and the community at large. This film is a must-see for any documentary fan that has an interest in character studies of little known subjects, as well as those who have a passion for the environment and the protection of natural attractions.",1357948800,,1613,5.06015037593985
8536468,5,B00962QZH0,"I saw this film in the Vieques International Film Festival. This is the story of citizens defending access to their public beaches in the face of the Marriot hotel who got a ""sweet"" deal from the Puerto Rican government. Protesters have been occupying the beach for 6 years to prevent the building of a hotel with a private beach.  There is a legal case still to be decided.  You will see interviews with the legendary Tito Kayak and other members of Friends of the Sea who have lead this and many other environmental justice struggles in Puerto Rico.  This documentary is even more important in the face of climate change which soon could be claiming more of Puerto Rico's shore line.  This film helps educate about this critical issue.",1355702400,,737,4.689922480620155
