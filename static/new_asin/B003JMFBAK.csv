Usually when you see something shot on video and then put on DVD or BD, they look noisy, but this is clean and as you would expect video to be on a higher res format. Actually, I could say that this is perfect!

Now about this episode.  This is basically about G. Robert Blakey trying to peddle his book and BS assertion that the mob (who was never brought to justice mind you) killed JFK.  You know, it's easy to blame the mob since they are known for killing, but you cannot say that the government would dare do such a thing now would you?  He argues with David Belin who claims that there was no conspiracy and that Oswald did it all alone.  He also argues that Ruby was just an innocent guy who just happen to be in the mood to kill someone that day.  Of course both guys are Jews, so Belin does not even want to give the slighted hint that it was a Jewish conspiracy.  Now since no one has been brought to justice on the matter could explain who has the power to cover it up!

So they go back and forth and it is clear that neither man believes in what they are arguing.  Blakey is hiding the true facts but at least wants to satisfy conspiracy theorist but not reveal government or those who control it having engineered the killing.  Belin just wants to shift Jews away from the whole thing ans that is his only arguement and reason for even sticking with his story.  Blakey says Ruby stalked Oswald, of which the prrof is on tape and photo.  Belin claims Ruby was just a nice guy who decided to kill.  Buckley did make note that if Ruby loved JFK so much, how come he was not at the parade?  That is a good question.  He just happened to be getting an ad placed in a paper on the day the president comes to town.  He could not be at the parade but he can be at the hospital, at the polic station seen nervously stalking Oswald and of course he just happens to want to get a Western Union Moneygram, which just happened to be down the street where Oswald was at (since he missed him before), and after sending money decides that he is in the mood to kill today.  He could care less about seeing the JFK in a parade, but he had to kill the man that they said killed the president.  They wat us to believe all of that?

Nice video for the records.",1276905600,2,2376,4.1017316017316015

8398324,4,B003JMFBAK,"William F. Buckley's shows still provide great television after all these years. This 1980s-era offering is a fascinating, spirited, and surprisingly fresh discussion about the 1963 Kennedy assassination: was it a lone gunman or a conspiracy? You certainly won't find such intelligent, articulate public affairs programming anywhere on the airwaves today. Mr. Buckley is sorely missed by his many fans (such as this reviewer).",1377734400,,426,5.671875

This is essentially a small panel discussion with each person trying to talk over the next because they all have an extraordinarily high opinion of themselves. If you have watched everything else about the assassination, then like me, you will probably watch this; and then be surprised that you took the time to actually write a review.",1364601600,8,454,4.833333333333333
