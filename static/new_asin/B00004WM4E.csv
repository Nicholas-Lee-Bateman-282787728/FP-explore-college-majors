1365891,4,B00004WM4E,"This underrated film noir is a nail-biter.  Mickey Rooney is outstanding, as are Jeanne Cagney (James' sister) and Peter Lorre, as always. Up until the end, when it goes ever so slightly over the top, the film is must-see.  It starts out deceptively, but doesn't take long before it's taking the viewer on a roller coaster ride of desperation, greed, and murder.  Don't miss it.",1094083200,4,378,4.7846153846153845
1365892,4,B00004WM4E,"100% fun film-noir rollercoaster in which Mickey Rooney plays an amoral mechanic who makes one horrible decision after another, getting himself stuck deeper and deeper in the quicksand of his predicament. The plot is hokey, but so satisfying...it includes a great femme-fatale and a swell part played by Peter Lorre. The photography is top-notch, and the San Francisco boardwalk (nighttime, natch)scenery is wonderful. Rooney is actually very good in this...he makes you root for him even though he acts like a jerk all the way through the picture. If you've ever dug yourself into a well of trouble, you'll really relate to this one! Enjoy!",974678400,22,641,5.114285714285714

So with a 16 year old of my own, I purchased this movie and watched it with him and the rest of my family.  All of us set enthralled as this movie twisted and turned through the plot.  The message was received by us all, just as it was by me 25 years ago as a kid.  A timeless movie classic!",1400889600,,448,3.89010989010989

But something goes wrong, as it almost always does when you dip into the till, and the guy finds himself having to do more and more wrong just to cover the previous wrong.

1365897,5,B00004WM4E,"The opening credits roll over stock footage of waves crashing on the shore.  Huh?  Doesn't everybody know the visual that goes with ""quicksand"" is that hand grasping at air as it sinks into the ooze?  Never mind, we get it:  someone is about to go under and that someone is auto mechanic Danny(Mickey Rooney).  Danny is having lunch at the greasy spoon with his buds from Mackay's Garage when in strolls hot mama Vera(tougher than nails Jeanne Cagney).  It's mid-day and Vera is wearing a cocktail dress, lots of after dark jewelry, and toting an evening purse.  Yep, Vera didn't go home the night before.  She's a bad girl and Danny's kind of woman.  Danny gets her to accept a date with him then realizes he hasn't any money.  Unable to borrow, he pilfers a twenty out of the cash register at Mackay's.  A friend is repaying a loan the next morning and the garage's accountant won't be showing up for several days so everything's going to be OK, right?  Nope.  Nothing is ever OK in the world of noir.  Danny's date with Vera is a success.  They end up smoking cigarettes on the beach and we know what that's the visual for.  The next morning Danny's friend stiffs him on the loan and the accountant shows up days ahead of schedule.  Danny goes to a jewelry store, buys an expensive watch on time, hocks the watch , and puts the twenty back in the register.  Things now go quickly out of control for Danny:  the jewelry store owner becomes suspicious Danny is going to skip without paying for the watch and demands payment in 24 hours or he'll call the police.  Danny rolls a drunk to get the money.  Vera's former boss, Nick,  finds out and blackmails Danny into stealing a car for him from Mackay's garage.  Mackay finds out Danny stold the car and tells him to pay for it the next morning or he will call the cops.  Vera knows where Nick hides a lot of cash and helps him steal it.  But Vera takes half the money and buys a fur coat.  Danny gives Mackay what's left, which is not enough.  Mackay takes the money then picks up the phone to have Danny arrested.  Danny strangles Mackay with the phone cord.  Now he's on the run with Helen(Barbara Bates) the nice girl who has always been in love with him.  They carjack a kindly elderly gentleman who happens to be a lawyer.  The lawyer tries to talk Danny into surrendering but Danny makes a last ditch attempt to hop a friend's fishing boat to Mexico.  Danny is shot and captured in the attempt.  Helen and the lawyer hear on the car radio that Mackay isn't dead after all.  Since Danny has never been in trouble before the lawyer thinks he will get only a year.  Danny accepts this, glad that it's all over.  Helen says she will wait for him.

The plot's pretty slender and the relatively happy ending is un-noirish but the movie crackles with suspense thanks to the tight direction of Irving Pichel.  Pichel also deserves kudos for taming Rooney's often out of control  energy.  No Andy Hardy mannerisms here.  Rooney gives a quiet, subtle, and thoughtful turn as the desperate Danny.  It is the best performance of Rooney's career.  Everybody's favorite creep, Peter Lorre, is superb as always as the reptilian Nick.  And look for a very young Jack Elam in the barroom scene.

This movie has some clever product placement.  The very first scene is a delivery man carrying a case of Coke into the greasy spoon.  Cases of Coke are also seen in the barroom.  Maytag appliances are seen in the window of a hardware store.  A clock in Mackay's Garage with Helbros advertising is seen several times.  And most fun of all:  an upside down box of Bit-O-Honey candy is next to the cash register in the luncheonette.

The audio and visual quality of the DVD is just so so but the movie looks like it was done on a real shoestring.  It was probably like that from the beginning and not a bad pressing.",1360713600,2,3848,4.4618705035971225
1365898,3,B00004WM4E,"""Quicksand"" is a film noir piece about a guy named Dan whose problem starts when he ""borrows"" $20 from the cash register at the garage where he works to take out a girl.  Mickey Rooney does a good job playing it straight as a young guy who makes one wrong decision that leads to the next, etc.  In the opening scene in a diner, he establishes a very natural delivery with dialogue, although we never get too deep emotionally.  There are no burning seething reactions which could have deepened the film's impact.  Perhaps that was director Irving Pichel's call.

Jimmy Cagney's sister Jeanne Cagney steals the movie for me as Vera, the bad girl.  Early on, Vera sets her eyes on a mink coat, out of reach for a woman who works as a cashier in a diner.  She smokes; she smooches and vamps her way through the part giving a great film noir femme fatal performance as the quintessential bad girl.  The best moment in the film is her final parting with Dan who realizes she has betrayed him and hurls an insult as he heads for the door.  She has one quick reaction like, ""No big deal.""  It's priceless.  However, perhaps as it is intended for the character, we feel no depth with the character, no intense emotional world, which makes the film entertain, but not grab you.

Barbara Bates plays Helen, the girl next door who loves Dan no matter how badly he treats her.  It's again hard to tell why she loves the guy so much, other than the script says she does.  She moons over him, almost stalks him it seems, and maintains a sunny attitude despite constant inconsiderate treatment.  While the actress in real life would later commit suicide by carbon monoxide in a garage, here she maintains the sunny superficial one-note performance.

Art Smith who plays Mackey does a nice job.  In Smith's bio, it states that he was part of the legendary Group Theatre and was blacklisted in Hollywood during the McCarthy era after being turned in by Elia Kazan.  While his career would go on hiatus about 1952, here he turns in an understated but excellent job as the garage owner who also seeks to gouge cash out of Dan.  There is one quick scene between Mackey and Dan making an arrangement for a late-night payoff that is brilliant.  It's brief, but the eye contact is direct, the emotions are clear and the characters play off each other well.

I confess that I did find it frustrating to see Dan make so many successively bad decisions.  The now vintage cars and the pier sets all gave a great flavor to the film.  Peter Lorre gives a strong performance as the creep Nick who also contributes to Dan's problems.  This is a film that is interesting to revisit or discover if you haven't seen it before, but does not quite rise to the level of a classic in the genre.  Enjoy!",1355616000,,2763,4.488977955911824

I didn't know what to expect since I'm really not a big Mickey Rooney fan but I was surprised. I really liked this film! Everytime something else went sideways with Dan I was on the edge of my seat. I have a new appreciation for Mickey as an adult actor.  The black and white moodiness, characters, narration and the location (I love Santa Monica Pier) made this a pleasant Saturday evening in. Peter Lorre is creepy arcade manager, Jean Cagney plays the perfect femme fatale and Mickey Rooney is believable as any guy in a tough circumstance.",1299369600,,638,4.5964912280701755
1365900,5,B00004WM4E,"A dandy movie, really. Now I know Mickey Rooney is not widely known for drama but he did do them, and although he's no James Garfield in this film he's no amateur neither.
You wouldn't think so but this movie should appeal to old car enthusiasts. The auto dealership where a certain amount of this takes place had to have been a Studebaker dealership as the vehicles in the lot are mostly Studebakers and in one scene Mickey Rooney is talking to his girlfriend and there are 2 brand new 1950 Studebaker trucks behind him. Also, the lawyer has a very nice 1950  Packard sedan.

Danny is extorted by mean men and later by bad men into more serious crimes to stay out of jail; ever deeper into crimes.

The appeal of the film is the believability of the situations Danny finds himself in. Filmed on location in Los Angeles. Peter Lorre is the bad-guy.

This is not an Andy Hardy type film, but sort of a film-noir without the mystery. It is intriguing with good character-actors and realism. The film claims a happy-ending; has a good moral; but it is not a happy-ending. Thus, it is not a feel-good, film. I am a happy-ending guy; so only 3-stars.

1365905,3,B00004WM4E,"Such a disappointment. I was loving on this snappy noir right up to the last 2 minutes. Has all the Noir elements: bad girl, good guy going wrong,  the mousy little dishrag good girl, moody black and white cinematography and the zippy dialogue. Then True Love shows up and ruins everything.

Mickey Rooney stars as an auto mechanic lead into an ever escalating Life of Crime by his little head, if you know what I mean. It all starts with him lifting a $20 from the cash register at his workplace, and spirals down the slippery slope, as mentioned above. Mickey is really quite good in this as the hapless everyman who can't seem to lift a penny from the ""take one, leave one"" dish without getting seen. The Very Bad Vera leads him along by the short and curlies until she doesn't need him anymore, but don't worry she gets her comeuppance. Peter Lorre shows up to slither along leaving a trail of slime on everything which I love. It's all nicely sliding into Hades when the Good Dishrag saves Our Hero from his baser instincts. Now why would she want this guy anyway, knowing what kind of awful choices he makes? Any way it all sours at the end as our hero is assured that he won't do hardly any time for his crime spree.

1365907,4,B00004WM4E,"Here's an unusual film noir because it stars an actor you wouldn't think would be in a crime film: Mickey Rooney.

But, like a lot of comedians, singers and other non-dramatic actors, Rooney could surprise you with his dramatic talents. He wasn't all Andy Hardy fluff.

Rooney has been a fine actor in his long career and he does a good job here in this role as a man who makes one mistake after another. Those mistakes compound into a major crime and Rooney winds up in major trouble. In fact, it's pretty amazing to watch this unfold as one small crime leads to one thing after another making things worse and worse as it goes along.

Jeanne Cagney is good as the typically-floozy blonde who is prevalent in so many of these film noirs. Barbara Bates is the wholesome good girl, but she really makes some stupid decisions late in the film, too. In other words, the three main characters are not evil people but they have major flaws.

Overall, it's an odd film of sorts and one that starts slowly but gets better and better as the story progresses. Definitely worth a look to see Rooney play this kind of role.",1239580800,,1112,4.463054187192118

Anyone who wants a look at the old structure, with its fish cleaning sinks, boat landings, and underpinnings, will be totally thrilled with this film! The movie ends with a fantastic chase scene down under/around the old pier. I was able to wade through the entire mediocre melodrama once, but have viewed it many more times, fast forwarding through the dialogue in order to watch the several sections that offer memorable pier views.  Having grown up, in the late 40's through 60's, with the pier at the center of many happy times, I really appreciate this opportunity to revisit it.  The midway scenes are not actually from the SM Pier.  The production may have used the Ocean Park Pier for these, or built their own sets in order to add a little more action. There is a lot of footage of the arcade hall, with its great pinball machines, as well as shots of the carousel.

1365912,3,B00004WM4E,"Micky Rooney was 30 years old when he made Quicksand in 1950.  His character Danny Brady is 26, but Rooney still looks eighteen. I think the picture works with Rooney as an auto mechanic who brushes off the advances of ""good"" girl Helen; played by a very pretty actress named Barbara Bates, and instead is seduced by ""bad"" girl Vera (Jeanne Cagney). Poor Danny wants to be a player but he has neither the money or the savvy to pull it off. Director Irving Pichel never lets viewers see the all-american persona that seems to embody Danny. Maybe this was done on purpose as a means to shed Rooney's Andy Hardy skin. When Danny lifts a twenty dollar bill from the register at Mackey's Auto his troubles begin.  Vera the blonde(who really isn't that good looking, her resemblance to actor brother James Cagney is striking) becomes the reason why Danny slips further and further into quicksand. With each thoughtless caper you almost wish Danny can escape.  His liason with the shrewd, dangerous Vera gives Danny just enough of a razor's edge to mark his demise into noir disillusionment. Peter Lorre gives a creepy performance as Nick, the arcade owner from Long Beach's famed waterfront called The Pike. When the sand gets too deep for Danny, this is when the picture fails to deliver.  A sugar coated, moralistic ending brings Danny back full circle to Helen his true love. This is why Quicksand is not on par with a noir classic like Crisscross.

Dan cajoles Vera into a date but finds that he hasn't enough money to take her out on the town. So he takes $20 from the cash drawer at work, intending to replace it the next day. When he is unable to come up with the cash in time, Dan's attempts at creative financing get him deeper and deeper into trouble.

""Quicksand"" isn't a bad film, but there isn't much to it, and what there is is repetitive. Dan is a nice guy with limited intellect and scruples who makes the same mistake repeatedly, digging himself deeper into the same nightmarish hole. He's an unimaginative sort of fool, though not inauthentic. Vera's a trashy, simple femme fatale, but a convincing threat. When Dan asks her, ""Think you can handle me?"" She replies, ""Sure, I can handle you easy."" And there is no one easier than Dan, whose aptitude for idiocy and self-pity prove a poor combination. Mickey Rooney is perfectly good in the role. Peter Lorre is wasted as the sleazy owner of a penny arcade. Maybe Lorre was gray-listed during this time. ""Quicksand""'s characters are not sophisticated enough to be compelling, and the movie's ending lowers the film where more courageous writing might have elevated it. But ""Quicksand"" is effective as a sort of plebian film noir. The Image Entertainment DVD (2000) has no subtitles or bonus features.",1174089600,,1912,4.7074626865671645

1365917,4,B00004WM4E,"This is Film Noir with a heart of gold. Unlike most films in this genre, it has a strong moral message, serving a good social purpose. Rooney is well cast as the average Joe, a mechanic who borrows $20 for a date from the till, leading to an unfortunate sequence of events that almost land him in the electric chair.

Some reviewers have complained that he is too ""baby-faced"" for the role, which centres on trying to impress some hard-boiled blonde with a thing about mink, but the whole point of this movie is that, throughout, Rooney's character is stretching to be something he is not - a cool, manly, streetwise tough guy, never short of money.

We all know the relationship with the blond is a mismatch. These elements maintain the feeling of constant imbalance and tension that pervade this movie and greatly add to the drama. If he were Bogart, he'd handle this blonde without even noticing, and the movie would be all the poorer for that.

Peter Lorre reinforces the Noirish mood as an oily game-centre manager. When you see him, you automatically expect to Bogart walk round the corner and make him sweat 'n' roll his dog eyes, but instead Rooney does. This is why this movie works. If it's miscasting, it's a masterly piece of miscasting.",1158796800,5,1249,4.642533936651584
1365918,4,B00004WM4E,"Mickey Rooney stars in Quicksand, a great film about how a small unnoticeable crime can turn into something large and out of control if one isn't careful. After needing money for a date with a beautiful woman in town (Jeanne Cagney), Dan turns to his cash register at the auto shop where he works for a twenty that he can easily replace later. However, when the accountant comes early to check up on the place, he's in need of cash faster than he planned, so he buys a watch on the installment plan and pawns it for the cash. When he learns this is a crime, he has to come up with $100 in a day, leading to even more problems down the line.

Rooney is wonderful in the leading role of this gripping film. His innocent face does not hinder him in this serious part. His kisses are passionate and reason to support why he was such a ladies man.

Although this is a bargain DVD, the picture is crisp and clear and the sound quality is good.",1150243200,2,937,4.229050279329609

Who knew you could stretch 20 bucks that far?

This 1950 cautionary tale piles one consequence on top of another at a furious rate, and if the results aren't entirely credible, they're not uninteresting either. Though Rooney himself dismisses the movie as a ""bomb,"" it's actually a fine example of the kind of solid, efficient B-level filmmaking that's pretty much disappeared from the scene.

1365922,4,B00004WM4E,"Automobile mechanic Mickey Rooney spots killer-blonde waitress Jeanne Cagney (Jimmy's sister) working at the local diner and impulsively asks her out.  His troubles begin when she accepts.  The cash strapped Rooney lifts a $20 bill out of the till at the garage where he's employed.  The couple spend a pleasant evening window shop drooling (Jeanne) over a $2000 mink and glaring (Mickey) at ex-boyfriend, husband, or something Peter Lorre at the penny arcade he manages.  Trouble arrives the next morning in the person of the garage's accountant, who's a couple of days early and sure to spot the missing double sawbuck. Dark eyed blondes are murder in movies like QUICKSAND, and before you can say ""Andy Hardy"" Rooney is up to his neck and sinking fast.

  QUICKSAND is well crafted and, on its own terms, convincing enough.  The toughest pill it has us swallow concerns Rooney. Even if he was pushing 30 when this one was made, he still looks like a  baby-faced teenager.  You can't blame an actor for being short and young looking, but it makes it hard to believe two beautiful women are interested in him, or that Judge Hardy is letting him stay out long enough to get into all the trouble he gets into in this one. Rooney has always had a sunshine-y, puckish charisma which found no outlet in this dark tale of a life unraveling.  In other words, QUICKSAND doesn't play to his strengths.

  Lorre fares best and his scenes with Rooney are delightful.  Lorre never had to present his bona fides when playing an unsavory character - he oozed sleaze.  Coupling his physical assets - short stature, protruding eyes, a decadently foreign accent - with master acting abilities and nearly flawless timing Lorre consistently rose above all but the best of material, as he does so here.  I wish his role had been larger.  Best scene - while putting the squeeze on Rooney's character, Lorre is told ""You must be crazy!""  Catching the beat and riding it out to the exact millisecond, Lorre lifts a hooded eyelid and says ""No, I don't think so.""  A pretty flat line on the page, but with Lorre's reading it's the coda to the best scene in the movie.  Did I mention it would have been nice if he'd been in more scenes?

 The delicately beautiful Barbara Bates plays Rooney's Good Girl ex-girlfriend. In movies like this, Good Girls are usually around just long enough to get jilted in act one. If lucky, they're allowed to throw a pair of sad puppy eye looks at the hero before disappearing.  They typically reappear in act three, ten minutes before the closing credits, with either a downy shoulder for a repentant hero to lean on or a funeral to arrange.  The Bad Girl, on the other hand, has it all going her way.  She gets the juicy act two meat, dresses better, gets her name above the title and her picture on the posters.  They're usually given a swollen scene or two to chew on and something to foam at the mouth over before the movie tosses them out.  Oh, yeah, and they gets to dress better, too.  Most of the time she's the ""good"" actress, while the other is the ""pretty"" actress - although with so little business to attend to, it's hard to tell exactly what kind of actress the Good Girl is either way.

 Miscast or not, Rooney is decent enough in QUICKSAND, an entertaining and unspectacular film",1098748800,32,3303,4.614065180102916
7925567,5,B00004WM4E,"[This is a DVD that I found of all places in a for sale bin of discontinued material at the Cambridge Public Library several weeks ago. This while my transition to emeritus and the ending of the grind of film reviewing under deadlines and Sandy Salmon my replacement on the day to day work was in progress. I had offered the film for Sandy to review knowing (and hoping) from long friendship and competition (mostly friendly as is the case among most film reviewers outside of New York City) that he didn't give what we called in the old neighborhood where I grew up a rats ass about reviewing a 1950s film noir. So here I am again in the saddle for a minute.)

Quicksand, starring Mickey Rooney, Jeanne Cagney, Peter Lorre, Barbara Bates, directed by Irving Pichel yet another Hollywood figure blacklisted in the red scare Cold War night when the powers- to-be in Tinsel-town and their cowardly hangers-on took a dive on funny little things like constitutional rights-and peoples livelihoods, yeah I am on my soapbox again, 1950

Forgot the film noir aspect of the film under review, Mickey Rooneys Quicksand, although only now is this minor classic noir and probably Mickeys best performance against type (he spent his early career as the ah, shucks cinematic version of Andy Hardy of that classic series of young adult books) being recognized as such. This plotline is strictly from Sister Cecelias, maybe Sister Mary Roses, or maybe Sister Delores, hell, maybe all of them, lessons from Sunday school at old Saint Stephens Roman Catholic Church in my old home town. The lesson: once you go down the slippery slope of sin (and probably crime as they were probably the same thing in their imaginations) then there is a serious rollover effect, serious consequences. Yeah, and obviously Mickeys character Danny, the lowly grease monkey, you know, auto mechanic either didn't pay attention or was absent those Sundays when whoever was running the Sunday school operation where he worshipped was holding forth about that very prospect. No question, he uncorked every possible evil as he went down the road to perdition.

Funny from a first look at Danny he didn't look like a guy who would wind up doing from one to ten in some California penal colony once the dust settled. But then you didn't know then what steered him down the garden path. Of course then we didn't know that he would run smack daub into a low rent femme fatale, Vera, played by Jeanne Cagney, who was serving them off the arm at a hash house where the local grease monkeys filled their lunch buckets and he made the fatal mistake of dating her up (a mistake as well since she was too tall for him, maybe too blond as well). Once you know all he was doing was trying to move might and main to get her down among the downy billows then all his fevered actions made a kind of off-hand sense as every guy, including this reviewer, has had first-hand experience with if he goes for the femmes. (Frankly this Vera didn't have the look of steam-infested career waitress, looked more like a bar girl or a roper on a scam but you never know what has a gal serving them off the arm when she is down on her luck, on her uppers).

Okay here is what the slippery slope looked like if you follow along (and suspend disbelief as well). It seemed after making that hot date for that very night Danny was cash-shy, needed some dough to carry some weight with Vera. Everybody was tapped out so, and remember, this is where he falls down, gets ready to take the big step-off if he doesnt catch a break, he grabbed a measly twenty buck from the skinflint larcenous auto shop bosss till. Just an overnight loan. No problem because some guy who owned him more than twenty would cover him the next day and that hot date would be worth it he could tell. Problem: the bosss accountant showed up early the next day for some other reason so he would need to cover the twenty bucks fast. He cant get the dough to cover so naturally he gets the fever-driven bright idea that if he goes and buys an expensive watch on credit for a hundred bucks (remember this is before cash-back credit cards could have saved his butt even if they were charging usurious rates) and then hocked it for thirty bucks.

That idea worked well enough for Danny in the short term, got him a reprieve from the bosss accountant although just barely and with a very jaundiced eye but then the next hurdle showed up at the garage-the dreaded repo man. Seems that in California in those days you didn't actually own, couldn't own, an item on credit until it was fully paid for, now too if I am not mistaken. The repo man gave him twenty four hours to ante up the C-note or he was going to stir for grand larceny. What to do, desperately what to do since a hundred bucks was way out of his league on such short notice. Simple, our Danny boy bops a drunk carrying plenty of dough on the head in darkened parking lot (lets call that one assault and battery in the night time and armed robbery, okay and you get an idea that Dannys wheels have gotten well off the track). He is in the clear now, his miseries are over as he handed the repo man his blood piece.

Of course Danny is just a misbegotten grease monkey and not some kind of career criminal so when he flashes fifty dollar bills Veras way she knows he is the guy who bopped the well-known drunk. Worse, the guy she used to work for at the local penny arcade who seemingly still has a thing for her, Nick, a seedy guy no question, played by the lovely Peter Lorre, knows he grabbed the dough. Has the handkerchief he used as a mask doing the robbery. Nicks price for keeping quiet-a new car from the auto shop. Or else.

Theres more, believe there is more in this Dante-like descend into hell. Danny grabs the car alright and thinks he is back on easy street and can now enjoy his new honey in quiet, maybe get under the sheets with her finally. Nope, that larcenous auto shop boss has his own scam. He accused Danny of stealing the car (he also accused others in the shop of the same crime in order to blackmail them). His price for keeping quiet three thou for a two thousand blue book car. Jesus. That is where the quick-thinking hustling Vera comes in to save his bacon, maybe. Seems that Nick besides running that seaside arcade does some business in cashing checks for guys-a low rent operation that is still with us unfortunately. She knows where Nick keeps the dough and it is not in a bank. So Danny goes and grabs the dough, hey who would have thought, thirty-six hundred. Now he is on easy street and can get back to the serious business of running around with that femme Vera.

Forget it. Vera, who was a drifter from hunger just like Danny, had her big eyes on a mink coat and while Danny was off doing something she bought the coat for the cash she was holding for him. Eighteen hundred bucks, her half of the heist according to her thinking, and not a bad price when you think about in the days when women craved mink and it wasn't politically incorrect, very politically incorrect to wear fur. Danny went crazy and finally saw she was little more than a bent whore. But that left Danny short with his boss. He went to the boss with his eighteen hundred-take it or leave it. The boss took it naturally since he was a larcenous character. Except that was a stall-he was holding out for three thou and was calling the coppers when Danny freaked out and strangled him. Murder, one, the big step off at the Q no doubt. Grabbed his gun too on the way out knowing he was nothing but a desperado now, an outlaw. All for a twenty buck deal to go around with a floozy.

Things looked grim, very grim as he was going on the lam to Mexico, or someplace very far away from California. This is where we get a little sneak redemption. See Danny had thrown over a nice girl, Helen, played by Barbara Bates, who would have been right up his alley if he was Andy Hardy but he had been in throes to that damn femme. The thing was this Helen was still carrying the torch for him, carrying that flame despite knowing that he was in a heck of a lot of trouble. Yeah, true love which he finally realizes he could have, should have held onto for dear life. She would share his fate whatever happened. Some people are like that, thankfully, thankfully for Danny. He tried to talk her out of going with him but no use. As they try to blow town his damn automobile blows a gasket. So he is back in the bright idea business. He, they will, at gunpoint stop a car on the highway and force the driver to take them away to Mexico. So add on hijacking, kidnapping and who knows what else to the total. And who knows what Helen will get for being his sidekick on this part of the descent.

Then Danny, Helen draw a convenient little break. The guy they kidnapped was a non-plussed lawyer who asked for the whole story. Asked as well whether that auto shop boss was really dead which would have been a tough dollar to get around for what started out as a twenty dollar petty larceny case. As it turned out that auto shop boss was not dead but had just been unconscious. Free, free at last. Well not quite. There was too much of a mess to get him off scot-free so he would be doing that one to ten. Guess who will be waiting for him coming out stir? But wouldnt Danny have been better off having listened to Sister Cecelia, Sister Mary Rose, Sister Delores, hell, maybe all three of them, about the slippery slope of sin. If you are a noir fan and can find this one take a look. A hidden gem of a film.",1500508800,,9550,4.3782412626832015

I ordered another DVD of this film because I liked the film (although it's not a ""great"" film noir, it's a 3/5 star film, IMO), I found it cheap and was hoping to get a better quality transfer. I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for this because the transfer is actually WORSE than on my cheapie collection. I'd only recommend you buy it if you can find it cheap, just in case, as it's unlikely this film will ever get a proper remastering. I should add that the cover of my DVD looks different, so maybe the transfers are also different. Good luck!",1456617600,,682,4.253846153846154
7925570,3,B00004WM4E,"Quicksand, 1950 film

The movie begins on a street at the restaurant ""Gus' Place"". Three men talk about their life. One man talks to the new cashier, a young woman. But he is short on cash and wants $20. Danny borrows it from the register, intending to pay it back next week. Danny picks up Vera and they go downtown to the Penny Arcade. [Do they still have these?] Vera plays a pinball machine and hits the jackpot. She used to work there. They talk about their past life. ""I can handle you easy."" Back at the shop the bookkeeper shows up early to do tax work. ""But I looked in the money sack."" A visitor explains the meaning of ""larceny"" to Dan. Now he needs $100 in 24 hours! Danny robs a drunk! He meets Helen, but remembers Vera. There is a fight at Nick's place. Danny drops his handkerchief and gives a $50 bill to Nick. Vera knows things. So does Nick (he wants a new car). Danny commits another crime. He was seen.

Mackey wants the car back or else pay top dollar. Vera Novack tells Danny about easy money at Nick's place. Nick breaks in. [No gloves!] He has bad luck! Vera can take care of everything. She does. Danny gets his share. Mackey wants the full amount, there is a disagreement. Did Mackey try to be too smart? Vera looks out for herself. But she talks too much. Did somebody finger Vera for the burglary? Is Helen foolishly in love? They drive away until a knocking tells of engine trouble. Danny hijacks a man in a Packard, a lawyer, and explains what he did. Helen is in the clear. A radio brings the news, but Danny didn't hear it. Two cops pursue him along the docks. The lawyer assesses Danny's chances.

This morality play warns the viewers about how bad choices, one small crime leads to bigger crimes. Was it over-dramatized? Yes, but it is still entertaining with no padding or dull spots. This story omits the background of Danny. Why did he suddenly turn bad? The sailors on the street suggest a port town, like San Diego. [Was this the same location for ""The Sting""?] The name ""Vera"" must have been chosen for its irony. The prices are far out of date, $20 would be nearly a weeks' wages. A $100 watch must have been greatly overpriced due to the Installment Plan. Forbidding a woman from having a man in her room was the law, not a landlady's whim.",1454371200,,2283,4.367058823529412
7925571,5,B00004WM4E,"First a word about DVD-Rs--
Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies manufacturer.

In Mickey Rooney's 1991 autobiography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Too-Short/dp/0679401954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Too Short</a>, ""Quicksand"" gets all of two sentences. To paraphrase: ""The less said about Quicksand the better. Making this movie was like sinking in the stuff,"" an overly-harsh assessment that may be due to personal issues rather than the picture's quality.

Mickey's agent in the 1940s, Sam Stiefel, often lent him large sums of money at racetracks. When Stiefel eventually asked for repayment, he wouldn't tell Mickey how much was owed. Stiefel suggested that he take half of the star's earnings until his debt was erased, thus according to Mick, over time he was bilked for a few million dollars. When Rooney finally rebelled and fired Stiefel, he was legally unable to sever all ties until appearing in two Stiefel Production Co. projects. These were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BIG-WHEEL/dp/B0006FFR9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BIG WHEEL</a>&nbsp;(1949) and QUICKSAND (1950).

This one's a fine minor noir. The way Mickey's character gets embroiled in ever-deepening trouble because of $20 taken from a cash drawer is deftly scripted. Jeanne Cagney as the ladyfriend who urges Rooney further into crime is also quite good. Peter Lorre's oily amusement arcade owner adds to the mix. The only weaknesses are occasional predictability and a formulaic happy ending. In spite of these, ""Quicksand"" remains an entertaining crime drama some 60 years after its release. (Note: watch for original Mickey Mouse Club host Jimmie Dodd as Rooney's pal, Buzz.)",1427068800,,2017,6.120141342756184

7925576,4,B00004WM4E,"Quicksand! is one of those films caught in public domain oblivion.  Consequently, any prints available are going to be watchable, at best and miserable, at worst.  Film Chest has released this latest version, ""Digitally Restored"".  That can mean a wide variety of treatments and in this case, there is quite a bit DNR (Digital noise reduction).  The result is that the film has been cleaned of most ""artifacts"", but at the expense of the images being a bit soft and ""waxy"" looking.

Overall, I found this film to be very watcheable--both in terms of story and in terms of the image.  Some will complain that too much DNR has been applied--but since this is a public domain film---it isn't too upsetting.",1409702400,5,703,4.768595041322314
