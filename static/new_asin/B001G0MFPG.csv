3593466,5,B001G0MFPG,We have all the Jag DVD's to date.  Love the series.  We aren't sure why they are released so far apart.  When will the last set be available?,1259798400,,142,4.0
3593467,5,B001G0MFPG,"If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. I love JAG and can't wait till season 10 comes out!",1259020800,,98,3.5
3593468,5,B001G0MFPG,if you own the first eight seasons you need to buy this season. can't wait for the tenth and final season.,1258156800,,106,4.095238095238095
3593469,5,B001G0MFPG,"LOVE this series.  Always anxious when a new season comes out on DVD.  Only one left!!!  Have to admit the romance between Mac and Webb is ridiculous and the non romance with Harm and Mac is exhausting. Many changes this season, AJ's retirement , Harm's brief stint with the CIA, Mattie, Tyner leaving, Harriet resigning, however the show's high quality and great courtroom drama continue. Bittersweetly looking forward to the Final season 10 with the knowledge that love does conquer all finally.",1258070400,8,497,5.036585365853658
3593470,5,B001G0MFPG,"all seasons were great except the last season , but the final was good , has a lot of action , with war and lawyer and could have lasted longer",1254182400,4,143,3.8
3593471,5,B001G0MFPG,"The JAG Series (Judge Advocate General) is by far a superior and realistic view of the Naval Judge Advocate General trials.  The friendships that develop are unique and build on each other.  I have the first 8 seasons and the 9th season is on order.  Now I will be waiting for the 10th and final season, and will be sad to see it end. I love the way that NCIS was a spin off of JAG and now I have the 6 seasons of NCIS as well.",1252540800,9,427,3.8850574712643677
3593472,5,B001G0MFPG,"Throughout the entire run of this series, it was consistently demonstrated that neither the writers, directors nor the actors themselves felt it necessary for this show to exhibit near naked T&A or sexually explicit scenes within any episode in order to deliver a highly rated show.  Nor did I notice the need for use of the ""F"" word to be used every other word out of any of the actor's mouths in order for the series to be considered ""in"" by some segments of todays viewers.  (No, I'm not a prude nor does anyone I know, work with or socialize with exhibit any need to use the ""F"" word in order to carry on normal, everyday conversation).  The series consistently delivered both interesting and believable material and usually kept you on the edge of your seat wondering how either Harm or Mac was going to overcome whatever peril they might find themselves in, or how they were going to prove their client's innocence.  It was a sad day when the series ended but guess all good things must come to an end.  Would have been nice to have seen Harm and Mac actually get married though.  All of the intermittent ""loves"" they each were involved in at various times throughout the run of the series just made one anxious for them to get back together with one another since they had great chemistry together and were obviously meant to be a couple.",1251849600,15,1345,4.537190082644628
3593473,2,B001G0MFPG,"The best seasons of this series are the third through the sixth. Subsequent seasons become less about the drama of the JAG, and more of an ongoing soap opera about the lives of the individual members, and seem to be searching for a focus. This series ended none too soon.",1251504000,7,271,4.44
3593474,4,B001G0MFPG,"On September 26, 2003, JAG returned for a ninth season on the CBS Friday night lineup.  Although the FRiday night move could have been a death nell, JAG continued to enjoy solid ratings during this year and returned for a tenth and final season in 2004.

The first episode of Season 9 begins right where the cliffhanger in Season 8 left off.  Harm, having resigned his commission, is in Paraguay with Gunney, Mac, and Webb; trying to complete their almost fatal mission.  When they return to JAG Headquarters, Harm finds out he is completely out of a job; as the admiral has filed his resignation and he is no longer needed.  During the next few episodes, Harm finds himself crop dusting and then working with the CIA until he is fired because his picture is shown on ZNN.  Admiral A.J. Chegwidden finally re-instates Harm, but only as a last resort.

If those storylines won't confuse you enough, just wait until you watch Mac deal with her feelings on having to kill.....someone very important (I won't give it away in case you never got to see the show), A.J.'s romance blossom and then his sudden departure from JAG in the season's final episode.

Here is a list of all 23 action packed episodes:

1. A Tangled Webb - Part II (4)
2. Shifting Sands
3. Secret Agent Man
4. The One Who Got Away
5. Touchdown
6. Back in the Saddle
7. Close Quarters
8. Posse Comitatus
9. The Boast
10. Pulse Rate
11. A Merry Little Christmas
12. A Girl's Best Friend
13. Good Intentions
14. People v. SecNav
15. Crash
16. Persian Gulf
17. Take It Like a Man
18. What If ...
19. Hard Time
20. Fighting Words
21. Coming Home
22. Trojan Horse
23. Hail and Farewell (1)

Although still a top-notch show, the only thing I missed from these episodes is that there was relatively little time in the courtroom.  I mean, the show is about JAG lawyers.",1251244800,32,1825,4.466867469879518

Even if Netfix or something else had it, would still have gotten the DVDs. Season 9 was probably one of the better ones as it saw change, with a main doing a lot of different things, and you could also see the telltale signs of a series winding down. How they managed to adapt with the post 9-11 world was excellent and it only makes the cast closer.",1432771200,,474,4.163043478260869

3593631,5,B001G0MFPG,JAG has become one of my favorite shows! I didn't see it when it initially aired over tv so it was all new to me when it began to air on INSP. I don't usually like military type shows but this one is different and has much to like about it.,1404259200,,240,3.7254901960784315

3593634,5,B001G0MFPG,"Never missed one episode ever. Men in uniform can only attract the ladies attention. Story well written, romance, action, verbal dual in court, adventure. Educational, learned about NAVY SEALS, Marines, combat, C I A, pilots and dangerous life. Politicians and there selfishness and self-services attitude. Experiencing the heartache of someone loosing a parent, child at war for his country, child loosing a parent that is MISSING IN ACTION. Loosing a body part and how to deal with it and that includes colleagues, family, work environment and your own personal loss HOW DO I SEE MYSELF.

3593639,5,B001G0MFPG,One of my favorite series. I was sorry to see it come to an end. Have all ten seasons on disc and rerun them from time to time and enjoy them even better the second time without the commercials,1394928000,,193,3.9743589743589745
3593640,5,B001G0MFPG,Ordered the product hoping it would be as great as the picture and that the quality would supersede the cost. The cost was very low but the quality was great. It also showed up quickly. Experience was good and would buy from this seller again.,1394496000,,243,4.4222222222222225
3593641,5,B001G0MFPG,"I liked this one very much!  As I do all JAG movies.  It got into alot more war than I like to see, but it seemed so real-life, and what I imagine our men and women in the Military do go through.  All of the players are so good in this.  I am sorry JAG series ended.",1394064000,,266,3.6140350877192984
3593642,5,B001G0MFPG,The comments on the leading man are same as all other seasons.  In this season there are few new characters added to make things refreshing.  It also shows deeper relationships among JAG officers in the corps.  It is the last season for John Jackson who has played his role as the 2 star admiral brilliantly since the first season and I was disappointed to see him leave.,1392940800,,371,4.507462686567164
3593643,5,B001G0MFPG,Love this ninth season.  Will order more and have ordered some others.  Will probably end up with the entire selection.,1392336000,,119,4.9
3593644,5,B001G0MFPG,I watched the show faithfully every week. Fell in love with every story written hated to see it end. Loved to see if Harm and Mac would ever get married but the show ended to soon.,1391990400,,180,4.027777777777778

3593656,5,B001G0MFPG,"This was one of my absolute favorite TV series.  It was wonderful thru Season 9, but I did not like Season 10.  The romance between Harm and Sara went to the wayside, and Admiral Chedwiggen went away.  Very disappointing ending.  However, it was still good thru Season 9.",1391126400,,271,4.583333333333333

3593662,5,B001G0MFPG,"This wasn't a tough sell for him, considering it was the one season in the set that he didn't already own.  Still, it arrived quickly and in near-perfect condition (I bought it used), so I can't think of a single thing to complain about!",1388534400,,237,4.386363636363637
3593663,5,B001G0MFPG,"One of the most infuriating aspects of DVDs is when the making of them doesn't let you skip the opening and go to the start of the episode.  You only need to see so many of the opening name and scenes that repeated each week of the series, when watching episode after episode.  Additionally, they have an all play, so you don't have to go back to the menu each time,scroll down the list to the next episode in sequence and select it - you can watch one, it ends, the beginning comes on, you hit skip and into the next episode you are - delightful.  Besides this is a series worth watching and re-watching and sometimes insightful to how the legal system does and does not work.",1388534400,,677,4.2734375

3593694,5,B001G0MFPG,This is one of those TV series where one gets attached to the characters and has to keep watching to see where they go and how they handle the obstacles in their lives.  The military aspects of this show are spot on.  The military courtesies and the uniforms are accurate to the letter.  As far as I'm concerned this is a must have for any true videophile's collection.,1362700800,,369,4.397058823529412

3593698,5,B001G0MFPG,"I just adore David James Elliott (Harmon Rabb) and Catherine Belle (Mackenze).  Their complex 'onscreen' relationship adds depth and believability to their characters.  This season of JAG was packed with explosive revelations about every cast member.  From the Admirals retirement, to Harriet leaving, to Webb actually dying, to Mack needing surgery, and finally - finally Harm and Mack coming together.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hours of entertainment.  Great Series!  It was sad to see it end.",1357344000,,495,5.447368421052632

This show have it all, it makes you think, smile, feel anger, sorrow and joy; it takes you to another place for awhile.  I guess it is better than later to catch a good program, maybe I can catch up seeing all of their seasons.  There are not many shows out there like this one and I truly enjoy JAG.",1267315200,4,456,3.978021978021978

3593741,4,B001G0MFPG,"Actually, what kept me watching on Season 9 was the romance between Mac and Webb - which was very nuanced and much more mature than the 'relationship' Mac had with Harm (up to and including the last episode of Season 10).  Steven Culp and Catherine Bell had chemistry while David James Elliott seemed to phone in his role throughout the season.

Season 8 ended before Elliott signed a contract to continue in his role - thus the Season 8 cliffhanger where one did not know whether Harm would live or die.  Preps were made for JAG to continue onto Season 9 without Elliott and presumably with Culp in an expanded role.  That would have been much preferable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, Elliott did sign his contract.

Nevertheless, these are strongly written episodes - if you've seen previous seasons, you will want Season 9 for your collection as well!",1264723200,6,854,4.782312925170068

3593756,4,B001G0MFPG,"Interesting plots and story lines continue as Harm, Mac, Bud and the rest of the gang do justice for the military.  There are major changes with 2 key figures leaving at the end of the season and 1 key figure dying.  This leaves Harm and Mac back to zero as to where their romance might vest itself and Harm takes on a Ward which shows an interesting other side to his otherwise devil may care self.",1262736000,,399,4.2368421052631575
