8436102,2,B004MMEDY6,"This DVD has a 41 minute video of Cami (including an interview) at what looks like Canyon Lake (or thereabouts) in Arizona, probably up in the mountains east of Phoenix.  It looks like it was shot with a hand-held video camera, the image has a lot of pixelation in some scenes, and the quality generally isn't very good.  There is video of 5 (not 7, as in the description) ""slideshows"" (of pictures from the shoot), which lasts 20 minutes; and since it's a DVD, the video is of course SD not HD.

So there's **61** minutes of video (20 minutes of which is a ""slideshow""), not the ""120 minutes"" in the description.  And the image files from the ""slideshows"" are NOT included on the disc, even though there's room for them.

Mostly it's an inexpensive retail version of a few parts of the David-Nudes.com website.

I returned it to Amazon as ""Different from website description"" and now i feel better.

The 'Cami Nude Gym' disc is a little better, but also has an incorrect run time in the description.",1310342400,4,1000,4.553072625698324
