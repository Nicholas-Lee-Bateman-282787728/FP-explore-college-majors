1071724,5,6305774668,This is the absolute best movie about fighter Jets.  The camera work makes you feel as if your are in the cockpit.  Currently this is playing on the IMAX screen at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  I recommend this to anyone who is fascinated by flying.,1003708800,2,258,4.446808510638298
1071725,2,6305774668,Tom Seleck narrats this film and he is way to dry! You look at the box and think you are getting a whole bunch of flight scenes when you are lucky if you get 10 minutes.  Too much time talking on how flight was developed.  Thats OK if that is what you are looking for.,998006400,6,268,3.8545454545454545
1071726,5,6305774668,My three year is absolutely in love with this movie. He has watched it more than one hundred times I am sure. I find it perfect to teach him the dynamics of flying and see the fighter jets he so loves without all the violence as in most other movies of this nature...would love to see more like this.,994204800,2,300,4.101694915254237
1071727,3,6305774668,"The sound quality (DTS) and some of the action scenes are OK.  But the rest of the movie is boring, and the sound track will make you want to vomit!

1071730,2,6305774668,"People who highly rated this have lost there minds. This must have been there first DVD. The video was the worst I have ever seen. Some sort of tinting filter was used throughout, at times masking half the screen. its similar to looking up threw a top tinted windshield. Also, this thing is boring and short. They pulled a sneaky by including the extra features as part of the total running time. The story lacked direction. The sound was good, but there was occasional ""digital distortion"" in the center channel. This happens in many DVDs when the producer disregards the dolby standard and exceeds Established levels. Your DVD player will not disregard these standards and will clip anything above for theater system protection. I heard the same in some places of Super Speedway. But it was a much better film.",979689600,7,812,4.807142857142857

1071733,5,6305774668,"I saw this IMAX film the first time at the National Museum of Naval  Aviation in Pensacola, FL.  (You'll notice in the opening credits that they  helped with the film)I was entranced by the stunning video images and the  ""feeling"" about flying that the scenery and Tom Selleck's  narrative created.  The score for the film is not ""TOPGUN-esque""  but rather a warm and inspiring score that reminded me of EVEREST. (Another  Spectacular MacGillivray Freeman effort).  Needless to say I saw it another  3 times while I was in flight school.  To make it easy on prospective  buyers I would offer this:  If you don't fly or aren't particularly  interested in aviation, but have ever been curious as to what makes people  want to do it, this film should shed some light.  If you fly or are an  aviation buff...well, this film really hits the bullseye.  Difficult to put  in words just how but watch the film and you know what I mean",959817600,20,926,4.604938271604938

Lost count of how many times I've seen them in person and have several DVD's of the Blue Angels  and the Thunderbirds, sorry guys But the Angels are best by far.  I wanted to see more of their flying,  I wanted to ""feel it ""  with the system I've got, But compairing the Blu ray with the regular dvd it was truly  compairing apples to apple  there was no big difference.

1071950,2,6305774668,"The Magic of Flight"" is just fair. Its only redeeming value is that it's only $14, Blu-Ray and eye-poppingly vivid. As one reviewer noted, however, they've attenuated the sound so much that the aircraft sound wimpy. This DVD certainly won't benefit from a good sound system.

And, at 37 minutes, it's a paltry offering. And probably 8 minutes of the 37 are devoted to the history of flight.",1343520000,,390,4.735294117647059
1071951,5,6305774668,"Last night's movie was ""The Magic of Flight"" DVD. It was part of an ""Experience the World"" collection of five IMAX films I found on the bargain rack at a local Ross Store. ""The Magic of Flight"" DVD comes in two parts: first is the film itself, adapted from an IMAX film for wide-screen TVs, and second was ""The Making of The Magic of Flight."" I think that an interested viewer would want to watch both. The film is actually shorter than the explanation of the making.

""The Magic of Flight"" is amazing to watch. The photography is overwhelming. Of course, this film is made with special cameras and for showing in IMAX theaters so the television version is but a small sampling. If you ever go to see it in an IMAX theater, be sure to bring your motion sickness pills! The film tells the story of flight from the birds to early human attempts, including the Wright Brothers, and onto such acrobatic flyers as the Navy Blue Angels. An emphasis is placed on jet flight and the Angels. The movie is interesting and well done. When you watch the film, you will probably be wondering how in the world did they ever manage to record that? Well, that's why you ought to also view the following explanation of how they made the film. In a lot of ways, I thought the explanation was more interesting than the film itself. And, of course, excellent though it might be, the film is but a preview of what you might experience in an IMAX Theater. If you ever get the chance, Go!

Neat too, cause you don't need the glasses to view in 2-D or High Definition.  The picture and sound are both superior - The only difference I noted between HD, or 2-D, and 3-D pictures is the objects aren't right in your face.

For a fan of the Blue Angels, this is also an excellent film on the F-18 Blue Angels team, with great footage of both external and incockpit footage of flight of a Blue Angels F-18.  While it is not as thematically complete as Paul Marlow's and Dave Gardner's ""Threshold: The Blue Angels Experience"" and while it may not be as visually stunning in a regular home video format, it is a first-rate production I would recommend to any fan of flight and aviation in general.

There is also interesting background on the origination of flight (Wright Brothers).

1072049,4,6305774668,"""The Magic of Flight"" was originally released in IMAX theatres, and would certainly have been impressive to see on the (very) big screen. The production, narrated by the mellifluous Tom Selleck, is a visual feast, and traces the evolution of powered flight from the Wright brothers to the Blue Angels. The tidbits of history are interesting, but it is clear from the outset that the stars of the show are the Blue Angels.

The film is short (about 39 minutes), as are most IMAX releases, but is generally well-paced and captivating. I found a few of the trails the director went down to be a distraction from the central theme of the film (e.g. showing some of the members of the Blue Angels lifting weights and running to stay in shape, etc.), especially with this short of a running time. The interviews with pilots were generally good, but they frequently devolved into platitudes about ""being born to fly"" and ""being at one with the aircraft"", etc. Perhaps, though, I am bit hypercritical of this aspect as a longtime airline (and former Air Force) pilot: it's not that the interview segments are bad, they're just very bland and homogenous.

1072143,3,6305774668,"This should have been named ""The Magic of Flight with the Blue Angels"". Unfortuately it is mostly about the Blue Angels, and not as much about flight in general and the magic of flying.  I do think the Blue Angels are fun to watch, so this movie is still pretty good, but it did not do much for my love of flying. The reason I say this is because I was hoping for something that was more in touch with my love for flying, which is smaller aircraft, not fighter jets. Another good title for this movie would be ""the Blue Angels and the Air Show"". Unless this is what you want to see, look for another movie.",1172102400,16,606,4.135593220338983

MoF takes you through the history of flight; from the Wright Brothers' first flight, to harrier jump jets, F-18 aircraft carrier landings/takeoffs, and the Blue Angels' rigorous training program!

Along the way, you are introduced to the basic theory of flight with impressive computer animations that illustrate how we were able to manipulate  the wings of a plane in comparison to that of birds to create lift and control it.

The flight footage is absolutely stunning with no visual-effects.  This film takes full advantage of IMAX, bringing you up-close and personal to the action.

1072243,1,6305774668,"The new ""UMD Mini"" dvd format is utterly ridiculous; and to release an IMAX FILM??? It's like listening to Dark Side of the Moon through a metal filament between two paper cups. This format WILL die, just like laserdisc, Divx, MiniDisc, DAT, and CED SelectaVision. What a waste of plastic / aluminum. As if that weren't bad enough - many UMDPSP titles which are filmed in 2.35:1 are butchered down to 1.78:1. And although Amazon's prices are somewhat reasonable, in retail outlets these tiny discs can go as high as $30, if not higher, and they are FEATURE ONLY - NO EXTRAS! UMDPSP is a novelty item that won't last. You'll see.

Well, well, well...reports are circulating that some studios are scaling back production of UMD titles due to poor sales. Turns out I WAS RIGHT!!

Universal and Paramount have bailed on this format. You can bet more will follow, it's just a matter of time. UMD is a SONY product; did you know they're going to release Blu-ray discs WITHOUT PLAYERS ON THE MARKET TO PLAY THEM?!?!?!
