5722320,4,B00CHQSEGW,Great Doc!! Told a good story escpially how the fans were involved in every show. Worth the time and money!!,1369785600,5,108,4.45
5722321,5,B00CHQSEGW,"First World Wrestling Entertainment presented ""The Rise & Fall Of ECW"" that told the story of the history of ECW using the footage from the promotion & their then-contracted talents telling the story followed by Jeremy Borash producing his own documentary called ""Forever Hardcore"" that also told the story of ECW using footage from the XPW promotion & initial Hardcore Homecoming show while hearing comments from former ECW stars & other wrestling personalities that weren't involved in WWE's production...now comes another look at Extreme Championship Wrestling called ""Barbed Wire City.""  This was a very unique presentation in that it was started back in 2001 around the time ECW was out of business but wasn't completed until 12 years later when the ""Extreme Reunion"" promotion was about to have it's first show so you get flashbacks to all the different events & problems throughout the day at the show throughout the presentation along with interviews with talent & those heavily involved in different aspects of ECW (some that have never been interviewed on the previous projects) that was taped back in 2001 & some of those same people over a decade later such as Shane Douglas, Todd Gordon, Stevie Richards, Sandman, Don E. Allen, John ""Hat Guy"" Bailey, Johnny Grunge & Rocco Rock of Public Enemy, Missy Hyatt, ring announcer Bob Artese, referee John Finnegan, Bill Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Frank Talent from the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, Raven, New Jack, Chris Chetti, Mikey Whipwreck, Nova, Joel Gertner, members of Atlas Security, Rhino, Jerry Lynn, Steve Corino, Tony Devito, Strictly ECW website manager Tony Lewis, ECW staff members Kathy Fitzpatrick & Ed Zohn & Dan Kowal & Gabe Sapolsky & Charlie Bruzzese, journalist Michael Teason & Mike Johnson & Dave Meltzer & Wade Keller & Michael Tearson & Bruce Mitchell & Jason Powell & Dave Scherer, and intervews with Axl Rotten & Angel & Blue Meanie & Lou ""Sign Guy Dudley/Lou E. Dangerously"" D'Angeli & Balls Mahoney that were conducted both in 2001 & 2013 while you heard comments from Paul Heyman conducted at past ECW press conferences.

The presentation begins talking about Eastern Championship Wrestling as far as one wrestler remembering how he was in the very first match on the first ECW card, moving into the ECW Arena & their relationship with the fans such as ""Hat Guy"" before going into details about the reign of Eddie Gilbert becoming the booker from bringing in Paul Heyman to the fallout that caused him to leave & Heyman to take over.  Becoming ""extreme"" was talking about next with the product changing direction catering to the """"MTV generation"" with the amount of sex & violence such as the heavy amount of blood involved in the product to the point where the State Athletic Commission admitted they turned their back to it before going into the sacrifices that Tommy Dreamer made with his dangerous bumps & threatening his own life.  The cult following was heavily discussed as the importance of their video tape sales, their television syndication, and how they were the first to embrace the internet along with details about what would happen after the shows at the local hotel before reflecting on the injuries & violence such as guys talking about their various injuries & the debate of the effects of chairshots along with the debate of how some guys were either stuck in doing ""hardcore"" or those who chose to do it.  How the Monday Night Wars effected ECW as far as talent raids were briefly discussed along with their troubles getting on PPV was brought up as far as details of the ""Mass Transit"" incident & the fan campaign afterwords along with how the talents were different than usual the day of ""Barely Legal"" before going into the impact of Tony Lewis & the ""Madhouse Of Extreme"" including what it has become today.  The issue of if things went too far as far as the Dudley Boyz heat, recalling fan riots, and the heavy risk the wrestlers took such as the flaming tables & balcony dives before talking about the issues that started to effect the company as far as issues with money & Heyman himself.  The TNN deal was heavily discussed next as far as how it changed the product but didn't help the company grow & why there was a lack of support from the network along with the end of the company with talents talking about why they continued to work for free, the final show, and when the realization was that ECW was dead & how it effected them to the point where one guy admitted that he was so depressed that he tried to kill himself before going into what went wrong with WWE's ECW relaunch & the Extreme Reunion show itself & ending the documentry showing where many of the talents are now.

DVD extras are outtakes including the discussion of the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance that Eastern Championship Wrestling was born out of, footage of Billy Corgan's appearances in ECW with Corgan & D'Angeli discussing how it all came about, Bob Artese giving a tour of the ECW arena & Tony Lewis giving a tour of the Elks Lodge, Public Enemy & Tod Gordon talking about the ""bomb match"", and an extended New Jack interview.

As I stated earlier in that this was the most unique presentation of ECW's history based off the fact that it was started 12 years ago & only recently finished but also the fact that they covered various issues that were either glossed over or not even mentioned in the previous documentaries along with names that we haven't heard from before when discussing ECW which is the biggest positive I can say about this presentation because we didn't heard the same stories that we've heard numerous times before along with the fact that they had access to actual ECW footage to use here.  Overall this is a must see for fans of ECW that I highly recommend.",1369353600,14,5790,4.786786786786787
5722322,5,B00CHQSEGW,"After a lackluster origin story from ECW's owner (WWE), a definitive documentation of Extreme Championship Wrestling's legend is finally here. This DVD documents the meteoric rise and tragic fall of not only a wrestling promotion, but a pop culture phenomenon. Pro wrestling would ever be the same after ECW and now fans can find out exactly why. Punches aren't pulled here. Nothing is glossed over and the brutal truth, for good or bad, is on display. Paul Heyman's cult-like hold over his workers and fans is truly a gripping and frightening story to be told. This is worthy of a place on any documentary lover, much less wrestling fan's shelf.",1367366400,8,646,4.881818181818182

8581854,3,B00CHQSEGW,"Pretty good stuff! Good inside info. A word of caution, tho. Sound quality poor. I had to pump up the volume all the way.",1424822400,,121,4.083333333333333
8581855,5,B00CHQSEGW,"More in-depth interviews on some topics than others, some interviews we've heard a thousand times before. As a die-hard, original fan of Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling I loved it. It would have been nice to see some interviews with some additional people, but what can you do when they're still under contract. All-in-all a Must See for any ECW fan.",1406678400,,357,5.067796610169491
8581856,5,B00CHQSEGW,"I have been a fan of ECW since I found it late on a Thursday night on a Chicago UPN channel in '98 and I also love most documentaries about pro wrestling, finding the human stories of those who made their life's work this form of entertainment and the challeges that the performers overcame and still face.  This DVD paints a clear picture of the love these people had for what they were doing, but also the long term effects of their passion.  I view this as a very well produced documentary about an entertainment art form that not only wrestling fans would find intgresting, but even non-fans could find the very human aspects of the performers stories to be compelling.",1401494400,3,673,4.553719008264463
8581857,5,B00CHQSEGW,"To give a little background about myself, I'm 34 and a huge wrestling fan - past and present. I watch all kinds of documentaries - the authorized high production ones from the big companies, and the underground, hard to find ones. Barbed Wire City is at the top of both lists. A lot of the time you start to come across the same footage and hear the same stories. This is not an issue with Barbed Wire City. It actually has unseen footage, not just the stock ECW footage that shows up often. The perspective is unique, telling both the backstory of ECW and the attempt to resurrect some of the past success with Extreme Reunion. Very interesting and well done all around. Ordering was painless, and the shipping was very quick. I had the DVD in hand within a few days or ordering.",1388966400,3,780,4.423611111111111
8581858,5,B00CHQSEGW,it really captured the cult phenomenon that was ECW. I loved the DVD and couldn't ask for much more. great,1382832000,4,106,4.35
8581859,4,B00CHQSEGW,Not much that was not covered in other ecw docs. But it has its good points and stuff that wwe does not own. That's always a plus. If you were a ecw fan. It's something you should own or at least see.,1379548800,4,200,3.7857142857142856
8581860,4,B00CHQSEGW,Cool film. Has some info never shared before. Great interviews with real ECW originals like public enemy and sabu! ECW ECW ECW ECW,1375574400,2,130,4.695652173913044
8581861,5,B00CHQSEGW,"I was one of the backers/pledgers for this project when it first went live on kickstarter.com and immediately pledge $50 because not only was this documentary was needed but the fact that this was going to be one of the VERY best documentary wrestling of ECW of all time. Why? The director of this video has been and seen ECW from the start all the way up until ECW finally folded. The director and project leader of this documentary was providing so MUCH content since he had already lined up TONS of interviews with wrestlers and employees of ECW. Hell, this documentary even has interviews of OLD employees that were just there to help with the show by selling tickets or merchandise or whatever and it is VERY interesting to hear what they had to say since this kind of stuff would NEVER appear on anything that WWE distributes. Also, ECW history/documentary that was made by WWE was so-so, it was not the best piece of history of ECW since WWE was the one to produce the video and all they really did was just showcase how the fed started and fall without any interesting facts or backstage stuff or cool stories! It was pretty much a basic copy/paste type of video and I could NOT buy it since it would be like breaking the ECW code and the fan inside of me would probably be disrespectful to buying a WWE product that was selling ECW products. I still have all my old VHS master tapes of ECW shows from PPVs up to ECW on TNN shows. Oh crap, I went off topic there for a bit! Anyways back to the documentary, I HIGHLY recommend this documentary to ANY ECW fan that is new or old because you will instantly fall in love with this documentary from the start to the end. One of the best part about this documentary is that the documentary focuses MORE on the stories, the interviews, the backstage stuff, the controversial stuff rather than show endless amount of wrestling footage. Don't get me wrong, I love wrestling footage just as much as any other ECW or wrestling fan but it would be nice to watch a documentary that focuses more on the business side and the behind the scene side of ECW or wrestling in general because if I wanted to watch wrestling matches I could easily just pop in my ECW dvd/vhs and watch those or go on youtube. So do yourself a favor, PLEASE support this documentary by buying this documentary because not only will you enjoy it you will also be proud to own this piece of history and you will surely be proud of adding this documentary to your ECW shrine collection if you have one. So instead of buying that lazy ECW rise and fall crap that was produced by the WWE, do the right thing by supporting this TRUE ECW documentary because the director of this movie deserves every single penny since he was able to capture/record thousands of hours of ECW stuff to make this epic documentary that is pretty much over a decade in the making. This documentary is basically the documentary that die hard ECW fans needed for closure because in a way this documentary felt like a great closure to finally letting ECW go because after all these years I still miss ECW but I always felt that there hasn't been a real legit ECW documentary that was made by a DIE HARD ECW FAN unlike some WWE director that made the boring ECW rise and fall film. Anyways, E C F'N W!!!!",1374624000,6,3290,4.412828947368421
