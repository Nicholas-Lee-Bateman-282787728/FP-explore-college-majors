7912089,2,B00000JGG1,"I along with many experts do not agree that ""nuclear winter"" is a reason not to prepare for a ""limited exchange"" or terrorist attack. Nuclear winter may occur in the event of full scale nuclear war, where EVERY warhead on the planet is set off. Many people including our government quit preparing to survive a nuclear event because they were wrongly convinced they could not survive the ""winter"" anyway. How short sighted. There is a very good book titled Nuclear War Survival Skills, that in this day and age should be required reading by every head of household.",1081555200,3,564,4.76530612244898
7912090,4,B00000JGG1,"This Nightline special, ""The Day After: The Perils of Nuclear War,"" ran just after The Day After, the TV movie.  At the height of Reagan-era Cold-War nuclear insanity, The Day After was a chilling account of what could, possibly, happen in the event of a nuclear attack.  Told not from the point-of-view of the people in charge, safe in their shelters, but from the eyes of the people affected by the politician's decisions, The Day After drove home the realities of the nuclear age to American audiences in the same way ""Threads"" did for the British.
That being said, it was extraordinarily responsible to run this special after the movie.  In it, scientists and politicians debate the accuracy of the film, the actual effects of a limited (800 or less warheads) nuclear exchange, and different Cold War perceptions of the world.  On one side, you have the Gipper-appointed politicos reassuring people that the film was far-fetched, and that America wouldn't be impacted nearly as much, and that we could all sleep knowing a nuclear war would result in a lot of dead commies without disrupting our PTA meetings and apple pie.  On the other side, you have scientists like Carl Sagan, calmly explaining what would actually happen in a way that puts most horror movies to shame.
If you are interested in the Cold War, nuclear war, Reagan-era politics, or just want to get the companion-piece to the recently re-released ""The Day After,"" by all means check out this Nightline special.  I can only hope that, should Anchor Bay decide to put The Day After on DVD, this is somehow integrated into it.",996624000,20,1594,4.82051282051282
