2054200,5,B00021LRXQ,"I originaly watched this movie as a kid and my memories of it prompted me to purchase this DVD. The movie wasn't as good as my memory but I still enjoyed watching it again, the funny parts are still very funny (fart comedy will never die). The quality of the sound and the pictures was very good for such an old movie and I will keep it in my movie collection for that rainy day when I have nothing else to do.",1126224000,11,410,4.012195121951219
2054201,5,B00021LRXQ,"We had this same movie when my boys were small only on VHS. Needless to say the VHS wore out long ago. This was one of my boys favorite movies. Although they are grown now they have gotten as much enjoyment out of the movie now as they did when they were small. Now if I could only keep the movie at home so I can watch it. Thank you so much for having this DVD for purchase.

2054272,2,B00021LRXQ,"A little dull. Sort of a Dukes Of Hazzard without the car chases. Don Johnson's a kid trying to make his air-boat into Water Version of THE GENERAL LEE. Moonshine is of course involved. The big event is the Annual Coon Dog Race. Ben Johnson's dog is the reigning champion. A ""Famous"" Country Music singer (a ten cent version of Tanya Tucker) has come to town for the sole purpose of buying that champion coon dog. She blows in Ben Johnson's ear trying to convince him to sell him to her. I don't know how I could stand so much excitement. About the only laughs come from Dub Taylor's dog who's flatulence is so raunchy he can empty a building QUICKER THAN A HAND GRENADE. That was really funny the first time I saw it......when I was 12.",1399939200,2,737,4.3478260869565215

2054277,5,B00021LRXQ,"We watched this movie several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was happy to find it available through Amazon.  The movie is set in South Louisiana, during the 30's or 40's.  Since we are from Louisiana, it maybe seems more significant to our family.  In reality, the movie was actually filmed around Marshall, Texas, I think.  Someone that understands Coon (raccoon) hunting will probably understand the importance of the big competition that is the focus of the movie. Even if you are not into that type of sport you can still enjoy the movie.  All in all this is a good, clean movie.",1391472000,,592,4.644230769230769

2054311,4,B00021LRXQ,"Super fun-filled movie depicting a thirties raccoon hunt of that era. It has speed boats, air boats, old jalopies, horses, coon dogs, loopy characters, but is definitely not politically correct. Have a howling good time at the antics of good folks like Ben Johnson, Don Johnson, Jack Elam among many other well known character actors.",1267574400,,334,5.090909090909091

2054318,5,B00021LRXQ,"When this movie was first released, my dad, aunts & uncles, grandparents and anyone else of the ""older"" family generational ties would sit down countless times and watch this, and would end up laughing so hard at times you would almost swear they farted in their pants!  Seriously, it's from a day and age before times as we know them now, but it was so cleverly put together, any generation will - kids and adults alike - will find it a classic, hard to turn away from.  You could say its stupid, silly, cantankerous - but not dirty or raunchy (well, not that much anyway - maybe just a teensy bit on the wild side).  In a word - it's an awesome, funny, hold-your-ribs movie.  Imagine going through a race and your car and driver is riding so wildly, and your hanging on for your dear life and finally, at one point - ""Oh Lord I do hereby repent of my sins...""

If that doesn't sound so funny, then you're missing the boat - and the movie... :o)",1199664000,8,946,4.292134831460674
