5057239,3,B0075PDRIA,"The primary reason I buy Blu-ray concerts is for the sound. I have read how great Blu-ray sound is supposed to be since its introduction. So how can I buy a Blu-ray that doesn't sound as good as a DVD? I have bought DVDs since 2000 that have 5.1 surround sound. Why does someone release a Blu-ray in 2012 that does not sound as good as a 2000 DVD? Is someone greedy?

The concert is very good and contains twenty songs but the whole time I was listening to it I was mad I could only hear it in stereo.",1348099200,10,501,4.01
5057240,2,B0075PDRIA,"Here's the blurb directly from Paul Simon's official site;

""recorded in superb high-definition by director Martyn Atkins along with sterling audio mixed by Phil Ramone and Andy Smith, will be available in three formats: 2-CD/1-DVD special package, Blu-ray and Standard DVD""

If it is so sterling then why cheat Blu Ray fans out of a lossless surround option? - a terribly wasted opportunity - great performances, great band, great songs - the stereo only PCM 2.0 24/48 stream belongs on DVD - NOT Blu Ray. A very disappointed Simon fan - what coulda' been...",1347926400,30,559,4.9361702127659575
5057241,2,B0075PDRIA,"From my personal pre-ordering experience along with the postings on this title, apparently not much content information available.  Just received Blu-ray and have scanned both the front and rear of the cover.  They are 2 of the 4 current images for this title on Amazon's order page.  Please click on the images to enlarge the song titles listings on the back cover.

From just a quick view of a couple of the different songs, the video is 1080/24P MPEG-4 AVC encoded but appears slightly oversaturated in color, with an overall ""soft"" image and a fair amount of black level clipping (Panasonic 65"" 3D Plasma properly adjusted) particularly in the backgrounds most likely from the low light levels the concert was recorded in.  Most surprising for a Blu-ray title though, it appears the only audio choice is 2 Channel (stereo) LPCM!  No 5.1 lossless codecs in either DTS Master Audio or Dolby True HD.  Has to be a first in my entire collection of concert Blu-rays.  Sounds fine but...

Hope this helps others like myself who may have questions concerning whether to add this title to your own collection.",1347926400,30,1105,4.835106382978723
5057242,4,B0075PDRIA,"Why are there so many questions? It's Paul Simon for goodness sakes! I'm docking 1 star because this concert is only 95 minutes instead of a proper 2 hours. Also, I think he should have performed ""How Can You Live In The Northeast?"" and ""She Moves On"" and ""Peace Like A River"".",1347840000,4,277,4.346153846153846
5057243,5,B0075PDRIA,"Is this DVD the exact same as the DVD contained in the CD (2 cd plus 1 DVD). Or is this more extensive???
Thanks",1347753600,,112,3.7083333333333335
5057244,4,B0075PDRIA,"I also question the ""Here Comes The Sun"" omission, but I also question also deleting ""Mystery Train"", ""Wheels"" and ""Peace Like a River"" which were included in the PBS DVD version of this same show.  During this tour Paul also played some other unbelievably great stuff  - Jimmy Cliff's ""Vietnam"", Bo Diddley's ""Pretty Thing"" and the first single from his then new CD ""Getting Ready for Christmas Day"" - all of this stuff would make for great bonus material.",1347408000,13,457,4.772151898734177
5057245,5,B0075PDRIA,"I was wondering why Paul's rendition of George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun"" is not included in this concert? He did perform it that night and I read it was one of the hightlights of the show. I saw Paul in Chicago on his most recent tour and the Harrison song was a real highlight for me, here.  Also, are there any extras on the disk? Interviews or sound checks or something.",1346284800,10,379,4.263888888888889
5057246,5,B0075PDRIA,Absolutely WONDERFUL concert!,1428883200,,29,9.0
5057247,5,B0075PDRIA,Paul Simon and his musicians are fantastic in this concert. I really loved.,1421020800,,75,4.846153846153846
5057248,3,B0075PDRIA,Great DVD...Too bad the sync is out!!! some shots seem to be in sync but most are J U S T out...very annoying to a musician...the content is very eclectic and the band are amazing and having a great time....Can there be a remaster????,1414713600,,234,4.340909090909091

5057250,4,B0075PDRIA,An excellent performance which demonstrates Paul Simon's talents in both writing and performing a wide range of music and musical styles.  Well worth the costs of the DVD,1405036800,,170,5.071428571428571
5057251,5,B0075PDRIA,"If you enjoy Paul Simon, and have never seen him in person, (or if so, not in the nose bleed section) this is as close as you'll ever get. Personally, I love it.",1396483200,,161,3.909090909090909
5057252,5,B0075PDRIA,"This is one of my favorite concert Blu-Ray disc. I attended a concert by Mr. Simon and Sting last week and had a decent seat. Although I paid 10 times the cost of this Blu-ray for the live concert, I actually enjoy this Blu-ray disc 100 times more. (I do have a mid-fi setup at home). Even if this disc only has 2Ch. audio, it is loss-less and it's much tighter than what I experienced at the live concert.
I was a little disappointed at the beginning when I realized that there's no 5.1 audio mix on the disc. However, I have realized that I do enjoy the sound as much as any other blue-ray concert disc. (Just crank it up a little :-)
The visuals are great and we get to see what each band-member is doing during the performance, which is hard to do in a live concert setting.
As many folks have already mentioned, the band is in  great form and Mr Simon seems to be enjoying himself during the show. I'll be playing this disc many times over to enjoy one of my favorite artist.
If you are on the fence, just go ahead and order it, crank it up and enjoy the great performance.",1393200000,6,1078,4.157894736842105
5057253,4,B0075PDRIA,"Different takes on some old favorites, backed by a smokin band. I wish it were longer, but I'll take it.",1391040000,,104,4.25
5057254,4,B0075PDRIA,This is a fabulous concert it is a different take on some of the best and some of the more obscure songs in his catalog. It is kind of a full circle for his obvious love of world music this time the lens is filtered through Louisiana Bayou music with some of the most multi-talented musicians he's ever played with in my humble opinion. Special kudos to guitarist Mark Stewart who also plays various wind instruments. Again just a very enjoyable disc with good if not outstanding video. Despite others complaints about length (95 min.) and the more problematic lack of 5.1 surround sound in any format (2 channel stereo ONLY) I would still recommend this to anyone who values music and musicianship over technology. I gave this a 4 only because of the lack of surround sound options.,1387065600,,783,4.640287769784172
5057255,5,B0075PDRIA,"The song selection, arrangements, performances, and filming make for one of the strongest concert DVDs that I've ever seen. It holds up nicely on repeat viewings.",1384387200,,162,5.269230769230769
5057256,2,B0075PDRIA,"I was of course anxiously awaiting my order.  THEN, it was such a disappointment I couldn't finish the concert.  The sound quality on the Blu-ray is absolutely the worst I've ever encountered on a DVD, let alone a Blu-ray.  Not even in stereo, let alone DD5.1, DTS or Dolby Master HD,  It has the sound quality of an old 45 RPM in mono.  There's no balance between the singer and the instruments, no ""surround sound"" to enjoy.  Nothing. A mono that took me back to being a kid with 45 RPM records before stereo albums appeared.  No sound choice menu.  It's not there.  Nothing.  Like a bootleg from Asia.  To enjoy this, you'll need to buy the CD, and somehow sync it with the video.  I will say the video is acceptable, but not what I'm used to with Blu-ray.  Your time would be better spent (and your money) by watching Paul Simon on Palladia on a Hard Rock Calling 2012 segment.  Unless you yearn for the olden days of a single ear bud from a transistor radio, don't waste your money on this particular disc concert.",1370736000,,1019,4.379679144385027
5057257,4,B0075PDRIA,"Love this concert, one star missing because it is only in stereo. I have tried different settings on my Onkyo receiver and in THX music it sounds pretty good. Good selection of songs, some old and some new. The best thing about this concert is the level of musicianship in Paul Simon's backing band, these guys are amazing and they all seem to be multi instrumentalists as well! Despite the lack of a surround sound track, still worth owning. I am sure I will watch it many times",1366934400,,479,4.454545454545454
5057258,5,B0075PDRIA,Everything I expected. I love Paul Simon's writing ability. I am 53 years old and very nostalgic. These songs bring a lot of warm memories.from years gone by. Thank you Paul Simon.,1365552000,,180,4.65625
5057259,5,B0075PDRIA,"I understand that there are issues with this disc as far as sound and song omissions go. But I believe that in a few years, as Paul gets into his mid and late 70's and eventually leaves us, you might watch this concert with different eyes and ears. You will feel sad that he's gone, and realize the treasure that he truly is. I will not wait till he's too old to perform to enjoy the hell out of this bluray. I have a Panasonic 55VT-30 and a Harmon Kardon soundbar with sub. When I play this for friends and family they rave about it, and don't leave till the credits roll. Enjoy it fully, as your life is passing quickly by, as is Paul Simon's.",1363392000,,645,4.126984126984127
5057260,5,B0075PDRIA,"The sound is the clearest I have heard on any type of recording, and there are many wonderful nuances to notice.  Great mixture of styles such as African, Cajun, and others which are often interwoven with each other.",1362873600,4,216,4.684210526315789
5057261,5,B0075PDRIA,"Great program, great performances...and what a band! Be sure to notice all of the unusual instruments, and keep an eye out for the piano being played using mallets.

The program covers material from Paul's, Simon and Garfunkle days, right up to his latest album release. But, if you're expecting 'cookie cutter' arrangements of these old songs, you'll have to look elsewhere. The new instrumentation and aggangements here, make these great old songs brand new again, and better than ever.

It's difficult for me to believe that Paul Simon is in his 7th decade ( I recall his 'Old Friends' lyrics: '... how terribly strange to be seventy ...'), he's never performed better and the band is as tight as a drum. NOTHIN' BUT NET!

Others in this forum, complained about sound quality. Here's what I heard:

DVD sound is crisp and clean but imaging was only narrow stereo, almost monophonic. My video system still uses a Dolby Matrix surround system, circa 1980's. With this DVD, my rear channels produced low level ambient sounds, only. Normally, with stereo or 5.1 surround programs, the rear signals are strong and quite effective...I rather like the effect. However, that effect was almost non existent with this DVD. In fact, I actually thought the sound was monophonic... even with my usual 7 foot seperation between speakers.

CD sound was warmer and less detailed. I think CD sound engineering might have been hurried, however, the stereo sound stage and imaging was far better on the CD than on the DVD.

Overall, I'd give both the CD sound and the DVD sound 2 1/2 stars each, but for different reasons. Nevertheless, both get 5 stars for music, performance and enjoyment.

I listened to the CD's before I watched the DVD, That was a mistake. While I enjoyed the music only program, I look forward to listening again. Now that I watched the singer and the band perform, I'll truly appreciate what I'll be hearing!",1362268800,8,1916,4.840978593272172
5057262,5,B0075PDRIA,"This is a very enjoyable concert with great rhythms delivered by a band of very versatile, multi-talented musicians, headed by Paul Simon himself.

The only complaint I have is that I was charged more for postage than the DVD actually cost. I was charged in excess of 12 dollars  for mailing costs, when the envelope showed a postal charge of 4 dollars and 33cents. Allowing say 1 dollar for an envelope, what was the other 7 plus dollars for?
I will be very cautious with any future purchases from Amazon, especially when the product is being supplied from a  U.S. supplier.",1360022400,,575,4.673267326732673

5057264,4,B0075PDRIA,"This could have had much better sound, but it is what it is. So, I suggest you set your receiver to 2-channel stereo (since that is all there is, unbelievably on this blu-ray. It sounds better that way than trying to use surround sound.
Sound only rates 2-3 star, but the performance is a 5 star. We grew up with Paul Simon; now we are growing old with him, so this is a keeper, but it is a shame the sound was not high definition quality.",1356220800,2,439,4.116279069767442

5057266,5,B0075PDRIA,this is a great video if you are a paul simon fan. I have seen paul simon live a few times and he is much different in concert than he is on his albums. his albums seem to be mellow but his live performances have much more punch.,1352937600,,229,3.7916666666666665
5057267,4,B0075PDRIA,"The music and performance is great. My only gripe relates to the lipsync, but I'm unsure as to where the problem lies
Set-up:
* blu-ray player (Philips, top 2010 model) connected via HDMI into NAD C390DD stereo amp, and picture passed on from NAD via HDMI to Philips TV (2010 model 7000 series)
* with normal picture setting, the picture is horrendously out of sync with the sound -- particularly noticeable at the start of Afterlife (drum sticks)
* the NAD doesn't allow for delaying the sound; most surround amps do allow for this
* setting the picture to game mode (turning off image procesing) noticeably reduces the delay, but it is still there -- and this makes the picture somewhat noisy/mis colored
--
Other concert blu-rays show some delay in standard mode, but not in game mode.

Ok -- the problem *could* be in the hardware set-up. But the problem is more noticeable in this blu-ray than in others.",1352419200,,911,4.6645962732919255
5057268,4,B0075PDRIA,"I've been a Paul Simon fan since the sixties. I found this concert only lacking a multi channel choice. Stereo only, that being said, the sound stage was very good but lacking the ambiance that Dolby Digital or DTS can provide.",1352073600,,227,4.560975609756097
5057269,1,B0075PDRIA,"no surround sound on a blu ray- seriously !!!  could have been a great concert for the collection, instead it sounds like a VHS tape with a better picture.",1351555200,3,155,4.344827586206897
5057270,3,B0075PDRIA,"I think the sound quality of the DVD could have been better to match the quality of the blue ray picture. It sounded like what one of a previous reviewer said that the quality was only to DVD standard.
