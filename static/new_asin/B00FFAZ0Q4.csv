5990507,4,B00FFAZ0Q4,"This a review of the BD of this three part mini-series that aired on PBS. I was provided an advance screener for an objective review.
If you have read any of my other reviews on Amazon, you know that I don't believe in spoilers, and I won't provide any here. But it is safe to say that this is not a mystery as we know who the killer is from the beginning. The mail character, Malcolm Webster is a weird psychotic who is what may be best described as a serial widower. He finds women with property and large bank accounts, marries them, takes out like insurance policies on them and then murders them. The series is based on true events (though editorial license was taken). The action moves from England to Scotland to New South Wales.  All this is provided on the package description.

It appears to be a police procedural drama too but no police show up until the 3rd 47-minute chapter (this was originally made for the British commercial network, ITV, in 2013, so time is allotted for commercials.

Malcolm is played by actor Reece Shearsmith who I found fascinating in another (and I think better) DVD Chasing Shadows. In that series he was a detective who had some quirks. This time, he is just creepy.

The scrip was written by TWO different screenwriters and  at least for me  it was not evenly paced. I think much of the setup could have occurred in the first (of three) episodes and then more time spent on the police procedural. The actual events cover a 15 year period (though Shearsmith doesnt seem to age). He has Various jobs but we are not sure what they are. At one point he says he is leaving a nursing career and going into IT. Then we see him teaching a class. (in what?). We know nothing about his education or credentials.  So  though I thought the acting was great, I wanted new things to happen.

This series aired on PBS but I don't know if anything was edited. There are few curse words (the S one) and one really graphic scene where a character who is wearing a half- face mask (similar to a character in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire) to cover missing face parts (we don't know how this happened because he arrives on the scene in that condition) has the mask removed. I certainly flinched at that and Id be surprised if PBS aired that scene.

So, though I really wanted to love this series I find I can give it a four star rating AT MOST.  And  if you saw this series on PBS I, again, recommend you catch Shearsmith in Cashing Shadows  a four episode mini-series.

The DVD and BD have no bonus features other than an option for English Subtitles (which I found I did not need to use).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5990508,5,B00FFAZ0Q4,"In 2013 did an excellent job of telling much of the true story of this sociopath.  Although it's not part of this series, some years before he murdered his first wife, it's suspected that he was connected to the suspicious deaths of 3 children at a hospital in Abu Dhabi and that his father, a Detective Chief Superintendent withd the Fraud Squad of the Metropolitan (London) Police, assisted his departure from the UAE.  In May 1994 he arranged the fiery 'accident' in Scotland that killed his wife of 8 months.  More crimes and plans to murder more women followed until he was charged in 2009.  He was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to life imprisonment - to serve a minimum of 30 years.  Since then he's filed several appeals.  The acting is great.",1439510400,18,752,4.616541353383458
5990509,5,B00FFAZ0Q4,"The Widower is a nice couple of episodes mini series that if you watch back to back is like watching a movie.  There are still the credits at the end of each episode, if you don't fast forward those the whole thing goes for about 2hrs 15 minutes but unless you've lost your remote it'll be slightly shorter than that.  I really wish TV shows when on DVD would just link the episodes together if you choose the play all option and keep all the credits to the end but as this is seldom the norm it's not something you can fault with the Widower.

This is a various locations in the UK, as well as New Zealand set thriller.  It's based on a true story, I wasn't familiar with the true case so I had the normal fictional viewing experience of not knowing if each targeted victim would die.  The Widower follows the self centred psychopathic nurse Malcolm Webster, who likes being in control and never to be questioned by the females in his life.  His rein of terror that the viewer knows about starts with his new wife asking him why he has wasted money they don't have on a clock he has asked her to sign for when it arrives the next day without discussing it with her.  He replies I didn't realise I had to, his wife then commits other in his eyes unacceptable crossing a line behaviour such as opening a bill with his name of it in the mail.  Malcolm then starts to plot her demise and won't stop with her.

What also makes the Widower more realistic and therefore more chilling is that it doesn't use Hollywood style ridiculously attractive people as the cast, everyone from Malcolm to the victim women look like every day people you see in the street.  It also highlights the ridiculousness of tying the hands of the police and others who want to warn potential victims since a non convicted criminal has more rights than the next victim.",1434412800,13,1839,4.382352941176471
5990510,5,B00FFAZ0Q4,"Elegantly produced and understated, yet chilling portrait of the murderer and con man next door. True story that perfectly illustrates and doesn't glamourize the 'banality of evil'. Excellent performances by the whole cast, but Reece Shearsmith gives an acting tour-de-force that is a genuinely unsettling, realistic portrayal of a killer.",1428364800,12,339,5.8
5990511,5,B00FFAZ0Q4,"I love  English mysteries, and I love true story mysteries...this has both.  It is such an incredible story that it makes one think....truth is stranger than fiction.  Had a writer such as Ruth Rendel written this, I probably would have said she went a bit too far this time...and for her fans, well, you know that is quite a distance.  The filming in Scotland and New Zealand is beautiful.  The regional costumes and customs...  If you love a touch of Britian you will really enjoy this jaw dropping story.  I have watched it 3 times, and know I will watch it again.",1471651200,,567,4.5

5990515,5,B00FFAZ0Q4,"The Widower, a three part story from PBS took me by surprise.  At first when I read the total time of 180 minutes, I thought to myself  3 hours let me get ready.
I enjoyed the beautiful photography of Scotland and New Zealand.  I am glad that the film was in 3 parts. After viewing Part 1, the suspense made me want to continue to watch.
The actors, especially Reece Shearshmith as Malcom are very good and you believe them. Although Malcoms actions to me are hard to believe.
The Widower is based on a true story about Malcom Webster(Reece Shearsmith), classified as a sociopath who charmed, married and killed his first wife, Claire (Sheridan Smith).
In the beginning of the film, at their wedding, Malcom was very convincing as he professes his love to Claire in front of the entire wedding party.  As they begin their life, Malcom starts to plot his deed. He starts spending money on things that Claire feels unnecessary.  Malcom buys an expensive clock and two expensive breed of puppies.  When Claire begins to show opposition, Malcom begins to poison her slowly with a drug that he steals from the hospital where he works as a nurse.
Slowly Malcom weakens Claire with his nice cup of tea and urging her to keep hydrated with the poisonous water he prepares for her.  Malcom manages to kill Claire by setting fire to their car and fabricates a story about a mysterious motorcyclist who ran them off the road.  Malcom moves to New Zealand and meets Felicity (Kate Fleetwood) who becomes his second wife.
Malcom convinces Felicity that she helps him find love again after the death of his first wife Claire. They marry and Malcom begins immediately on their wedding night to again use his poisoning technique with tea and water.  He manages to keep her groggy and she suffers from unexplained weakness and blackout.  Malcom stops his madness when he learns that Felicity is pregnant.  After the baby is born, he resumes his mission to again become a widower and this time he will have a child and money.
The suspense has me on the edge of me seat, will Malcolm get away with killing Felicity too?  The film is suspenseful and shows the deviousness and callousness of Malcom as he leaves Felicity with her money and returns to Scotland and seeks a new wealthy woman to marry, kill and make himself a widower again.  Malcom, a real charmer is able to convince people that he is not doing anything wrong.  While it is based on a true story, I know that parts of the story are different from the real story. The Widower is filled with suspense and unbelievable actions of a sociopath, who is also fascinated with fires and is willing to do what he needs to do in order to get what he wants.
This movie is for audience over 18 years old.",1449014400,4,2736,4.557142857142857

5990517,3,B00FFAZ0Q4,"Could have been better.  Reading about this true story, this seemed to be a substantial departure from real-life events, but entirely understandable given the constraints of the medium.  I agree with Felicity Drumm's (Webster's second wife) appraisal of the mini-series -- it didn't capture the charm or the cunning manipulation of the real Malcolm Webster.  The one on screen was portrayed as a simpering sycophant.  John Hannah, while given prominent billing, barely was allowed to show his face.  Dull and plodding in bits.  Needed an edge ... a bit more ""chill"" factor.  Archie Panjabi is the reason to watch -- the only character who had depth and interest.  Still, it kept my interest for all three episodes.",1445472000,2,714,5.042735042735043
5990518,4,B00FFAZ0Q4,"The Widower is a short miniseries first broadcast on Britains ITV in 2014 that tells the story of Malcolm Webster, a Scottish man whose affable manner endeared him to a string of women on several continents who, not coincidentally, had life insurance policies or savings of which Webster was the beneficiary should they die. And die they did or in some case, almost. Webster was convicted in 2011 of the murder of his first wife Claire in 1994 and the attempted murder of his second wife in 1999, among other crimes. The film focuses on Malcolms (Reece Shearsmith) three principle and proven victims: his first wife Claire Morris (Sheridan Smith), second wife Felicity Drumm (Kate Fleetwood), and fiance Simone Banerjee (Archie Panjabi). We watch as Malcolm marries these women, drugs them, steals from them, deceives them, and his reaction when they begin to suspect. The law was far behind but did eventually catch up.

The style of the film, directed by Paul Whittington, takes some inspiration from cinma verit. Cinematographer Martin Fuhrer seeks an unpolished look and muted color palette without giggling the camera or seeming self-conscious. This reminded me of 1970s cinema, and it accentuates the documentary aspects of the film. Reece Shearsmith plays Malcolm Webster as a bit of a social oddball, which his second wife has said is not accurate. I like the darkly comic elements of Shearsmiths performance, but this introverted, unmasculine character who speaks in clichs leaves us wondering how his victims could be so easily deceived. That seems to be the only significant departure from fact. Some girlfriends and suspicions of other crimes are omitted for obvious reasons. Scottish DS Charlie Henry (John Hannah) led the 5-year investigation that led to Websters arrest. Its not fast-paced, but The Widower is an intriguing true story of a male black widow.",1445212800,4,1872,5.137704918032787

5990520,2,B00FFAZ0Q4,"The main culprit is played admirably and perhaps accurately, but he portrays a murderer who is more slime than crime.  He is a woefully inept murderer and transparently foolish even in his attempts to steal and commit insurance fraud.  I found the program to be slow moving and tedious, without much ingenuity or cleverness.",1444521600,,324,4.981481481481482
