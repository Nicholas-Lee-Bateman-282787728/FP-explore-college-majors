6817500,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Grace is a beautifully-filmed story of a young woman's desperate struggle to understand herself and her past as she teeters on the brink of self-destruction. The love and generosity of a recovery community tells a story seldom depicted with such fidelity. The performances of Annika Marks and Sharon Lawrence are extraordinary. Everyone should see this film, whether or not they have a previous experience with addiction and recovery.",1423180800,,434,5.397058823529412
6817501,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Everyone must see this film! If you are, in some way, connected to alcoholism then the incredibly accurate depiction of the AA process will floor you. Even if you are unfamiliar with AA, though, the performances by every actor makes this a must see film. Annika Marks captures your heart from the first scene and keeps you enthralled through her entire emotional journey. Sharon Lawrence, Cindy Joy Goggins, and the rest of the cast are wonderful to watch as well, as they create a dynamic ensemble that together tell a story every audience member can relate to in some way.",1423180800,5,574,4.75

6817503,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Excellent movie - sensitive look at a tough subject.  If you know anyone who struggles with alcohol addiction, or abuses it without acknowledging they have a problem, check this movie out.  Annika Marks and Sharon Lawrence really worked well together.",1432166400,,251,5.25

6817507,2,B00PLYTGLO,"Not my kind of movie.  I guess I was lured in by something in the description but it was a mistake on my part.  For what it is, it was done pretty good...",1428364800,,154,3.6363636363636362

6817509,5,B00PLYTGLO,"The film ""Grace"" is a wonderful story, very touching, and the acting is great, especially the star, Annika Marks, who did such a great job, I experienced all the anger, pain, depression, sadness and finally resolve.  The movie had me in tears towards the end.  I wish everyone could see it.",1427587200,,290,4.666666666666667

6817511,4,B00PLYTGLO,"I was turned onto this little gem by a friend. It turned out to be captivating, and the acting by Annika Marks and of course Sharon Lawrence was superb. I definitely recommend this---especially for those considering going through a 12-step program.",1427328000,,248,5.073170731707317
6817512,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Remarkable film!!!! Regardless of whether you or a loved one are addicts, the message is simple.....giving grace to those who don't think they deserve it gives them hope. We all need grace, yes, but when life gets ugly (and we all know it does) then giving hope can save a life. The best part of giving hope??? It's priceless, and once given, multiplies all by itself.
Watch this film. It's NOT slow-moving - it's stunning, and it's the stuff that life is made of.  For those who think otherwise, I wonder how ugly life really is for them....?",1426982400,,543,4.540816326530612
6817513,2,B00PLYTGLO,Poor acting! But did love the scenes of New Smyrna Beach.,1426464000,,57,4.2727272727272725
6817514,4,B00PLYTGLO,Really touching movie!,1426032000,,22,6.666666666666667
6817515,4,B00PLYTGLO,"A really great message and inspiring for recovering alcoholics. There was little subtlety in the writing (a bit more telling than showing), but a good watch nonetheless!",1426032000,,169,5.296296296296297
6817516,1,B00PLYTGLO,Acting was good but movie moved very slowly. I was waiting for some kind of excitement...boring. I would not even have giving it 1 star. Also i didn't even finish the movie.,1426032000,,173,4.4375
6817517,5,B00PLYTGLO,This movie is absolutely amazing!  It was worth every penny of that rental fee and I can't wait to go buy it!  The characters are amazingly written.  I loved Sharon Lawerence's character.  It's just such a poignant topic and movie.,1425945600,,231,4.7
6817518,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival.  It was a very true portrayal of the hope and support that is available to someone who is willing to ""try something different.""  Sharon Lawrence is perfect. See this film. You won't be sorry.",1425945600,,238,4.511627906976744
6817519,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Port Townsend Film Festival with the Star, Annika Marks and Producer, Sylvia Caminer, present for a wonderful discussion afterward. The film offers an excellent portrayal of the devastation and loneliness of addiction, alongside the hope and salvation that comes from the generosity and humanity of the AA community. Most folks' lives have been touched by addiction in some form, and everyone will appreciate the honest, intelligent performances Grace. brings.",1425945600,,506,5.417721518987341

6817521,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Understanding what our path is not always easy, and even harder is our path with obstacles that prevent us from becoming how we are meant to be. This movie gives us room to think if we are the obstacle.",1425600000,,202,4.205128205128205
6817522,5,B00PLYTGLO,This movie does a great job integrating the background images of the New Smyrna area into the story. The staging and lighting create a mood that helps the audience feel the story of a young woman waking up from addiction.,1425513600,,221,4.55
6817523,5,B00PLYTGLO,"A beautiful written story. Amazingly executed. Touched my heart. Changed my life. I thank all involved. I will treasure my experience with this movie always.

6817524,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I had the privilege of seeing this film at the REEL Recovery Film festival in NYC, it is a moving and beautiful depiction of the challenges of early sobriety for young people. The movie is very honest and true to the experiences faced my so many young people who struggle with the issue of facing their addiction early in life. The movie shows how incredible the journey of recovery can be and that it's a beginning, not an end. Bravo to the filmmakers and the brilliant cast in this movie.",1424822400,4,490,4.455555555555556
6817525,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I saw that Grace is finally coming out February 24th on DVD!  Ive been keeping an eye out for it.  I saw Grace when it had its World Premiere at the Nashville Film Festival in 2014.  I read the description in the festival brochure and thought it would be interesting.  I absolutely loved the movie!  I even stayed after the movie for a Q&A with the cast!  I knew I would buy the movie as soon as the credits rolled.

It is not often an addiction movie gets it right.  From the aggravation of addiction, to the 12 step meetings, to the various relationships it dominates.  The dynamics between Sonia(Sharon Lawrence) and Grace(Annika Marks) was authentic.  And I absolutely fell in love with Annikas performance!!  She had me in tears.  I am definitely going to follow her career!!

Grace truly resonated with me.  As someone who has dealt with her own sobriety, I am a harsh critic when it comes to movies dealing with addiction.  Grace did a great job!  I can see this movie touching the lives of fellow addicts and their loved ones.  I am looking forward to sharing this movie with friends.  I also want to share it with friends in the addiction field.  I could see them using this as a means of discussion with people facing the struggle of sobriety.

I will be first in line to purchase this film and Im looking forward to finally seeing Grace again!!",1424390400,4,1355,4.475409836065574
6817526,5,B00PLYTGLO,I was fortunate enough to see this film last year at a festival.  There is a certain honesty to this film that could only be voiced by someone who went through the nastiness of addiction.  Annika Marks' performance was beautiful.  She was so committed to this part that at times in the film you had to ask yourself whether or not this was coming from a real experience.  Sharon Lawrence brought a maturity to this film that complemented Annika's character and her nativity.  The film was beautifully shot and really brought out the atmosphere of a small beach town in Central Florida.  This film was definitely worth seeing.,1424390400,8,624,4.731481481481482
6817527,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Gripping, heartbreaking, truth-telling...this film is truly amazing!  Annika Marks gives an incredibly genuine, powerful, extradordinary performance that is not to be missed!",1424131200,,174,6.909090909090909
6817528,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I was fortunate to see the film at a film festival. While I have no real personal connection to the world of ""Addiction"" I was very much captivated by all the characters and the story line. The acting is great and you really care about what will happen to Grace and her new friends.
I recommend the film to everyone!",1424131200,,316,4.283333333333333
6817529,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I was lucky enough to see Grace at the Woods Hole Film Festival where Annika Marks won best actress for her portrayal of Grace. So well deserved! I have been surrounded by addicts my whole life, and I seek out films about addiction, and am usually left cold. Annika Marks' central performance brought me to tears again and again. I know the woman she was channeling, or at least that's how it felt to me. At the q & a after it seemed that I wasn't the only person who felt that way. Sharon Lawrence is perfectly cast as well as a woman haunted by her past. The AA scenes are what AA ACTUALLY looks like unlike most films which make AA seem like a depressing, dark experience. It was a difficult film for me to watch in some ways because it struck so close to home, but I am grateful to have seen it and will be recommending this movie to everyone I know. See this film. You won't be sorry.",1423872000,3,889,4.174418604651163
6817530,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Loved this film. A tender and passionate depiction of a painful and difficult subject. Annika Marks gives and soulful and moving performance that tugs at your heart. People dealing with addiction themselves, or with a loved one will relate to the characters struggles, and perhaps find a sense of hope along the way.",1423872000,,316,4.981132075471698
6817531,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Annika Marks is a force to be reckoned with. Truly one of the most powerful, open actresses of our time. GRACE is a very entertaining film that could have easily gone many different directions and been too dark, too preachy, too sentimental, etc. Beautifully shot and skillfully directed, there's a realness to every scene.",1423785600,,323,5.0
6817532,5,B00PLYTGLO,I had a chance to see this at the Port Townsend Film Festival. This is a powerful movie with a message that should be heard by anyone with alcohol dependence or abuse or anyone who knows someone with alcohol dependence or abuse or anyone who cares about the problem (that pretty much includes all of us). The performance by Annika Marks is realistic and moving. Sharon Lawrence was perfect opposite Annika. I would strongly recommend seeing this movie. I have it on order and will be showing this to friends and family.,1423699200,4,519,4.6521739130434785
6817533,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I had a chance to view the world premiere of this film in theaters and it was fantastic! The film moved at a great pace, never lagged and whizzed by  in an instant (which, to me, if one of the best things you can say about any film). Major kudos to the acting of the entire cast - even down to the minor characters, all were great. Annika Marks deserves MAJOR recognition for playing the lead, it was my favorite performance of the entire film festival I saw this at. Another plus for this film is it actually deals with some meaningful/emotional issues so there is a nice depth to it.

Recommended!",1423612800,3,599,4.339285714285714
6817534,5,B00PLYTGLO,Love this film! The performances are soulful and heartfelt and the theme is universal.  Thank God for indie films - This one is a gem!,1423612800,,134,4.36

6817536,5,B00PLYTGLO,"Nobody's life is untouched by addiction in some form - and this film is one of the best, most honest discussions of this that I've ever seen. I feel so fortunate for having experienced Grace. It is an important lens through which to see an addict. The performance by the lead actress, Annika Marks, elevates this movie to new heights and you won't regret taking time to watch this talented young woman who we are certain to see a lot more of.",1423440000,,442,4.402439024390244
6817537,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Nashville Film Festival.  It is wonderful, great cinematography, music and acting.  If you have a family member or friend that struggles with addiction it is truly eye opening!  I can't wait to get it on DVD to add it to my library.  A MUST SEE",1423353600,2,291,4.236363636363636

6817540,5,B00PLYTGLO,GRACE is by far the best movie I've seen that deals with the subject of addiction.  The performances are wonderful; Annika Marks is superb in the lead role-- a bona-fide star and someone to keep your eye on-- and Sharon Lawrence is fantastic as well.  I encourage everyone who has ever known someone or had a problem with addiction themselves to watch this movie-- you won't be sorry!!!,1423180800,,386,4.661764705882353
6817541,5,B00PLYTGLO,"I saw this film at AFME last year and it was a profound experience for me. If you are an addict, or like me, have a loved one who suffers from addiction, you should absolutely see this movie. Annika Marks delivers and one of the most honest portrayals of an alcoholic I have ever seen and Sharon Lawrence will break your heart and lift your spirits as her sponsor. I am so glad to see that ""Grace"" has distribution so more people will be able to see it. Congrats team ""Grace"" and thank you for this beautiful film!",1423180800,3,514,4.255102040816326

8688562,1,B00PLYTGLO,"Propaganda for the cult know as AA and nothing more. Might as well watch a Scientology propaganda movie. Besides, how many addiction/recovery films do you wish to see in your lifetime. Frankly, I've reached my limit, especially when they're clich&eacute;d and boring like this one.",1438041600,,281,5.266666666666667
8688563,4,B00PLYTGLO,"Good film depicting ravages of the disease of alcoholism,  and finding recovery in the 12 Steps.
Depicts well the ways alcoholism effects other relationships. Some viewers may find this film simplistic. This is a challenging issue.",1436745600,,231,5.416666666666667
