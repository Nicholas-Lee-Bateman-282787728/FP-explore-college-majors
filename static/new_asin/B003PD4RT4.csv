8537545,4,B003PD4RT4,"DVD was what I expected.  It was a basic lesson on the different types of takeoffs and landings- soft field, short field, crosswind, etc. Clear lessons broken down on the dvd so you pick what parts you want to focus on.  A good way to cement what you learned from an instructor; also gives the correct and incorrect sight pictures from the cockpit.",1354060800,2,348,4.507936507936508
