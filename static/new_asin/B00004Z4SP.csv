7928247,1,B00004Z4SP,"I have never felt so uncomfortable watching an anime as I did while viewing this title.  I love off the wall comedies and bizarre plotlines but this title is simply perverse.  Only the morally bankrupt could call this entertainment. If you truly enjoyed this title please seek professional help before you become jailed for stalking, kidnapping, and/or something worse.",1153526400,,369,5.237288135593221
7928248,5,B00004Z4SP,"A comedy about a a science nerd vs. his newly aquired love interest he affectionatly named Daisy, the main character hasn't even seen the outside of his lab for years, before he accidently sees Daisy on the computer monitor, from there the story unfolds... The series from the very beginning had me and my friends cracking up, I would rate this 6/5 stars if I could.  It has some running gags that never grow old, and make you wonder what's going to happen next.  My only complaint is it's only 12 episodes long, it could of easily be lengthened to twice that many and still not be tired.  A definite must watch for any comedy anime fan.
  I definetly suggest this anime, one of the all-time bests.",1007510400,2,698,4.464566929133858
7928249,1,B00004Z4SP,"I've never had to say this about any anime until this DVD. Don't buy it! The plotline stinks, and is way too dumb for my taste. Just the story of Techno trying to get ""Daisy"" ( real name, Hitomi) to fall in love with him was enough, but was it really necessary to make Techno some weirdo who had been locked in a bomb shelter his entire life? That part ruined the mood of the entire anime for me. And what was up with the pet missiles? The ending itself was just so anti-climatic and stupid that I felt angry for wasting the few hours I spent watching this disasterous anime. If you want a good anime series to own, do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. You'll only be frustrated. But, if you simply *must* watch it, I would recommend buying it used or borrowing it from a friend.",1007510400,2,786,4.177631578947368
7928250,4,B00004Z4SP,"I watched most of this series in one sitting -dealing with older fansubs some time ago. Originally, I thought the same way the other female reviewer felt. However, I decided to give it a chance and watch it -I was happily surprised. It really isn't that bad of a show. Yes, what Techno puts her through is extremely horrible, however as another reviewer pointed out, you have to look at it from his view too. Here is this poor kid who has no idea whatsoever on how to act in society -he only comes out because he sees ""Daisy"" and falls for her.  If you like watching stuff that has a wacky main character (hey, hes more real than some other main mail characters w/ all his wierdness...) then try it out. Maybe the vhs version so that you don't have to shell out too much for the dvd.",1005264000,2,783,4.25503355704698
7928251,5,B00004Z4SP,"This cartoon is not fairly judged, detractors are just too quick to call Techno abusive. If you are this judgmental, you will not enjoy this great cartoon. You must set aside your feelings about Techno's actions and put yourself in his shoes.
Techno is not the womanizer / molester that others make him out to be. He just has -never- had contact with human society. Techno was born in his grandfathers fallout shelter, who subsequently raised him, and told him never to leave. Sequestered in the shelter Techno grew up with science as his lifestyle. As a result, he has only a scientific state of mind. So the comedy and ""abuse"" come from his total lack of any social skills. All of Techno's actions and treatment of Daisy (or X Yamakawa, for that matter) go to show just how much science dominates his life.
At the end of episode 5, as Mr. Solomon points out, Daisy slaps Techno for very obvious reasons. At this point, yes, you definitely should feel more pity for Daisy than Techno because what Techno has done thus far is horrible! But the cartoon would be meaningless without Techno's so-called ""abuse"". You can compare Melvin from the U.S. released movie ""As Good as it Gets"" to Techno and you will see what I'm talking about. Neither Melvin nor Techno are seeking to abuse or harm or mistreat their women, they're just love sick and don't know how to get their affection.
Haunted Junction, which I think is made by the same people, is much less ""controversial"" while still keeping great humor and a similar plot. Although you may say you want a normal life or a normal job or a normal boyfriend, you wouldn't actually ever want it. You are sure to enjoy Haunted Junction, even if you are turned off by Don't Leave Me Alone Daisy.
Now on the technical side this DVD set is superb. All twelve episodes of Don't Leave Me Alone Daisy are presented on two DVD-9 (dual layer DVDs) discs, six episodes per disc, in a double Amaray keepcase, in Japanese only with English subtitles (Dolby Digital 2.0 at 192k). I have no problems with the audio and the video quality is excellent. The menus are static backgrounds and are fast to access. There are five chapter stops per episode (opening, part a, part b, ending, preview), this is perfect for me. The scene select menu while visually appealing, I find is cumbersome to navigate. A menu similar to Haunted Junction's would have been better, in my opinion. The root menu has a nice extra though, it plays the entire TV edit of the opening and closing songs. The first DVD plays ending song and the second dvd plays the opening song.
This release is made even better by the fact that all twelve (12) episodes of this cartoon cost little more than three or four episodes of other cartoons. FYI, Haunted Junction was released in the same manner. Add both cartoons to your collection, for sure!",995328000,10,2837,4.608695652173913
7928252,4,B00004Z4SP,"Bandai continues their wonderful pattern of making their less popular series available in one complete set...in the ""Don't Leave Me Alone Daisy"" DVD Collection.  As DVDs go, this one is pretty no frills, but when you consider that in dollar per episode count, it's one of the best deals in anime, it's worth it.
The series itself is one of the most surreal anime series I have ever seen.  It presents itself as a typical shojo anime series, but the undercurrents can be dark, edgy or just plain bizarre.  Lighthearted jokes frequently have deep, awkward meanings and what would otherwise be serious themes are presented as essentially flippant.
That said, there's something very compelling about the series.  Much as with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in ""As Good As It Gets"", we see the main characters move together in spite of the fact that the main male character has very serious personality issues.  A large part of the fascination with the series is over whether or not the heroine (Hitomi, or 'Daisy' as Tekno, the male lead insists on calling her) will ever (or will want to) see past the male lead's flaws.
I, for one, recommend it.  I've never seen another series quite like it given both it's flaws and it's strengths.  Oh, and one more thing: I guarantee you that by the end of the third episode, the ending theme with be stuck in your head for a week.",976924800,8,1365,4.639004149377594
7928253,4,B00004Z4SP,"Many review from other viewers complain that this animation is not as good as others.
However, remember one thing: This animation is a ""young Japanese girl"" style animation. It means this product is focus on young Japanese girls originally.
If you hear the ending song, you may find out that it's really focus on young gilrs.
And more, it needs some ""Japanese style"" jokes background to understand the whole story.
If you are not a ""Japanese young girl comics"" favorite, just forget this film. Else, try it!
P.S.: If you watched ""Maison Ikkoku TV series"", you may find out that the voice of ""Kyoko Otonashi"" is the same as the sexy teacher in this film. :)",976665600,4,656,4.663793103448276
