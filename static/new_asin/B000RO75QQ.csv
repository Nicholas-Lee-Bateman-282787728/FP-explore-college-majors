The Watchtower Organization has continually denied that this is a problem in their organization. That is absolutely disengenuous and false. They have been taken to court many times and lost legally their fight to claim no responsibility. When they resolve their case out of court they pay a penance and require the the victims to remain silenct or the Watchtower Society will take legal action against them. They want to picture themselves in a 'spiritual paradise' and this film obviously doesn't fit well with that claim. They claim to have been taken to court only a very few times and this true. The reason for the claim is that they will and have often settled out of court.
Go to SilentLambs.org for more detailed information. Remember this, that when a male Jehovah's Witnesses comes to your door you may be talking to a ""pedophile"" and not even know it. In fact, the person accompaning him will probally not even know it. It so silent and repressed in their organization that most Jehovah Witnesses refuse to believe the truth about pedophilia in their oganization. Another reason why they don't talk about it is because if pressed enough about it you may be disciplined.
THIS IS AN ACCURATE FILM TO SEE. IT IS ABSOLUTE TRUTH. THE TRUTH DOES SOMETIMES HURT WHEN IT IS REVEALED AND HERE IT DOES.",1296345600,3,1429,4.742971887550201
8201624,1,B000RO75QQ,"Sexual abuse is the worse thing a child could go through, especially when is someone in the family. I am a victim of abuse and yes it scars you for life, however I don't think that the religion of the abuser has anything to do with it. Why people make these videos and write these books attacking and condemning Jehovah's Witnesses I will never understand. My uncles molested me and about 20 other children in my family and when we decided to go public and tell everyone about the horrors we went through, never for an instant any of us brought their religion into it. They were very devout and well respected Catholics, but we never blamed the religion, they were all pretending to be someone they were not, they had everyone fooled, their priest and fellow christians didn't know. So why would we blame the religion? I also have friends of other religions that were also molested, they didn't bring up the religion either. The problem is the people, not the religions or organizations. No religion is exclusive, anyone can come and join, they don't do background checks on possible members, they just have faith that they want to serve god and they are welcomed. There is no way to know, so why do people keep blaming the religions?",1280793600,2,1234,4.613636363636363
8201625,5,B000RO75QQ,"This doc was moving, funny, original - a tough job when you are covering sexual abuse of children. It's also groundbreaking as I believe this is one of the first covering sexual abuse within a Jehovah's Witness family. I've also read the subject of the documentary's book, Father's Touch. Both are extraordinary. I can see this story as a movie actually. Highly recommended for everyone - victims, teachers, parents, police, lawyers - all who have a vested interest in this last taboo.",1182297600,6,485,4.926829268292683
