8084905,4,B000BC8T2I,"A young doctor Julian lost all his hope when his stewardess wife died. He flies to Ushuaia (the southern tip of Argentina close to the Antarctica) where they had their wedding, to scatter her ashes and then kill himself too.
Meanwhile a stewardess Teresa, who is extremely depressed that she might be pregnant but her boyfriend doesn't seem to care, also boards the plane. They both go into the mountain in deep snow to freeze themselves to death, and end up meeting with each other.

""Todas Las Azafatas Van Al Cielo"" is a strange film. The story does not make complete sense. First I thought I had missed some details and I have watched it many times since, but it still does not make complete sense. Some of the characters and settings are fairly ludicrous. However, even though I cannot pinpoint what it is, there is something really sincere and heart-warming about this film. Also it has a distinctive Argentine flavor, somewhat chaotic yet elegant. The soundtrack is some of the best you will hear: atmospheric and ethereal, it really fits the sternly beautiful, other-worldly scenery of Ushuaia. If you are into Hollywood blockbusters probably this is not for you, but for some this film can resonate quietly for a long time.",1323475200,5,1232,4.811320754716981
