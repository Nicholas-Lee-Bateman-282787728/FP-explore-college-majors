8190027,2,B000BNKB4Q,"Being a fan of White Lion, I expected a concert according to the title. Not so. The main 2 songs are Wait and Radar Love and a lot of tour talk, which is informative about the band, but not what was expected. It only ran about 77 minutes. Was very disappointed that more songs from the band were not included. They could have made an awesome dvd with live coverage of one of their concerts.",1203811200,,390,4.213333333333333
