8253988,5,B0014137P4,I would want to know if the cover actually reflects what the story is about. Is the movie interesting? Will it hold my interest? I would also want to know if the movie sound track is good. Does the music reflect the scenes in the movie. Finally I would want to recommend this movie to others for viewing. Is it a movie that I would want to promote WORD OF MOUTH? EYE WAS BLIND looks really AWESOME!!!!,1205625600,,401,4.220779220779221
