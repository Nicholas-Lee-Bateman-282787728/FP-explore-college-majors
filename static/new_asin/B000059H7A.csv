1404483,3,B000059H7A,"I bought this duo hoping that the quality I had seen in Prince of Eqypt would also be in King of Dreams.  It turned out that Prince of Eqypt rates a 5, while the King of Dreams is ~3.  My kids have enjoyed both movies though!",1175817600,2,225,3.869565217391304

Can I therefore recieve a refund?",1175731200,,145,4.576923076923077
1404485,5,B000059H7A,"This is the perfect set.  My children absolutely love ""The Prince of Egypt"".  Adding ""Joseph, King of Dreams"" is a fantastic bonus.  Both movies are wonderful tellings of the Biblical stories of Moses and Joseph.  The producers and writers of both movies did quite a service to the Old Testament by staying true to the events.  I feel that any parent who wants to find a good, quality movie for their child/children should absolutely buy this set.  The score of ""The Prince of Egypt"" is one of my favorite movie scores ever.  Great music, even better stories!",1173830400,7,559,4.701030927835052
1404486,5,B000059H7A,"If you are a bible loving person, you will love how well the makers of these movies did with these stories!  They bring tears to my eyes. Two of my favorite events recorded in the bible put together so accurately and full of life.  They did and exceptional job with the story, the graphics, the mood, the drama, everything was perfect!",1121040000,2,335,4.475409836065574
1404487,5,B000059H7A,"My children LOVE these movies. They are so well done and it's too bad they haven't received the attention they deserve (in my opinion). This is a GREAT deal for both movies. You won't be disappointed!
I was not expecting Joseph King of Dreams to be as good as Prince of Egypt, but like the first review that I read, I think it is as good if not better than Prince of Egypt. The picture is vibrant and wonderful, the story is as close to the true story as possible, and the songs are absolutely WONDERFUL. My children loves this movie. It is a great story about forgiveness, love, and faith. I was suprised to find that Ben Affleck was the voice for Joseph. Although he is not my favorite actor he does a WONDERFUL job as the voice of Joseph. Much better than Matt Damon as the voice in Dreamworks movie ""Spirit"". Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed and your family will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish they had done more advertising for this movie and it had received more attention. It deserves it. I hope that Dreamworks does more films like this of the stories in the Bible!",1078099200,7,1090,4.4278606965174125
1404530,4,B000059H7A,"I enjoyed both of these very much, but Prince of Egypt was the better of the two. Joseph suffers from ""sequel syndrome"". It's good, but not as good as the first.",1222560000,,161,4.225806451612903
1404531,5,B000059H7A,"I owned The Prince of Egypt on VHS and it has been watched so much that the tape is warn.  I needed a new copy and I was looking for a reasonable price.  I found The prince of Egypt/Joseph - King of Dreams at a very good price.  I paid the same price as the orginal VHS copy and recieved a much better deal.  Thanks.

1404532,5,B000059H7A,"This movie is an outstanding combination of high quality artistry and exceptional content. I often feel forced by animated movies to choose between one or the other, yet this film for the whole family seems to have it all. The music is inspirational without the cheese of most Disney flicks. Although some creative license is taken while interpreting the meaning of the related Biblical scriptures, my kids ""got it"" and love to re-read these stories in the Bible as a result of having enjoyed the movie so much. I highly recommend this and ""Prince of Egypt"" for every child's video library!",1207958400,,590,4.851485148514851
1404533,4,B000059H7A,"Prince of Egypt is a very well done movie, sticking very closely to the original account, though where it does deviate, the original meaning/intent is still preserved.  Moses, a Hebrew babe is set adrift in a basket in the Nile in order to save his life.  Pharoah's wife (daughter in the original account)finds the child, takes him in to raise him.  Moses grows up thinking he is Egyptian, only to one night find out he is Hebrew.  From there his actions result in the death of an Egytian guard, causing him to flee into the wilderness afraid for his life.  He sojourns with the Midianites and learns of God from them.  The Lord God comes to speak to Moses from the burning bush and tells him to return to Egypt to deliver His people, the Hebrews.  Moses doesn't want to go, but he obeys.  Through his obedience, the Lord works out judgement on Pharoah for the treatment and continued captivity of His people.  Eventually, after God strikes the firstborn of all of Egypt and institutes the Passover, Pharoah releases the Hebrews.  Their mass exodus out of Eqypt and Pharoahs change of heart bring them to the Red Sea where the Lord provides yet another miracle for their escape.  He parts the sea so that His people may pass on dry ground, and as Pharoah's arms pursues them across the sea, the Lord let's the water rush back into it's place and kills Pharoahs army, yet again giving the Hebrews cause to rejoice and believe once again on the One True God. The animation is good, as well as the music.  This is a movie to watch with the whole family - a good example of human history, of rulers and nations and how God has preserved his people, even when they don't listen to Him.
Joseph King of Dreams is less well done than the Prince of Egypt, and though much liberty has been taken by 'fleshing out' the story from the original, I feel that overall the pupose of the story is preserved.  Joseph, the second to youngest son of Jacob by his most loved wife, Rachel, is the favored son.  The coat of many colors actually signifies that Joseph, not ... will inherit the double portion, which was completely counter to cultural traditions of the time.  That Joseph had dreams that showed his brothers in subjection to him only angered the brothers more.  They plotted to kill him, but ... convinced them to sell Joseph into slavery.  Joseph prospered at whatever he did, though he did end up in prison, falsely accused.  Even there he was given charge over the whole prison inner workings.  From there is where he, with God's revelation to him, tells the baker and the chief cup-bearer the meanings of their dreams.  It was from prison that Pharoah has him brought to himself to tell the meaning of his most disturbing dream.  God reveals to Joseph the meaning, and Pharoah places Joseph second in command, answering only to Pharoah.  Joseph prospers yet again, then he is faced with his brothers, and the hurt that they had caused him.  He must choose to forgive them, but first he tests them.  They pass the test and he reveals himself to them.  Then he sends for the whole household (a very large group) and moves them to Egypt where he can help provide for them and so that he can see his Father again.  This is another example of human history and God's intervention/plan to save his people.  It teaches that though we may not see the reason for our present personal circumstances, the God has a plan, and if we are faithful, He will prosper us in the things that matter.",1206921600,,3475,4.5184
1404534,5,B000059H7A,"Most of you have seen the Prince of Egypt - a solidly good flick.  Joseph is also based on the Torah story of Joseph, and does a decent job with the story of this great man.

Overall, I'd say ""Joseph"" is the less-catchy younger brother of ""Prince of Egypt"", but is really great.

And the price can't be beat!",1204502400,2,308,4.186440677966102
1404535,5,B000059H7A,"I used to make a point of watching Cecile B. DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" every Passover, but these movies changed that.  I can see both of them in the amount of time I formerly spent on the one.  In ""King of Dreams"", the animators use the medium to great effect.  The dreams suggest the work of Van Gogh.  As a musical, though, I prefer ""Joeseph and the amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"".

I like the artistic effects in ""Prince of Egypt"", especially the way they use heiroglyphics to explain parts of the story.  Also quite touching is the use of Hebrew in the lyrics of some of the songs, and the use of Jewish actors for the hebrew roles.  The movie only fails in its study of ancient Egypt - the costumes are more from ""The Ten Commandments"" than from any historical study.
Regardless, it's an excellent way to get in the mood for matzah.",1197590400,,840,4.4868421052631575
1404536,4,B000059H7A,I am often interested in watching videos with Biblical concepts and these videos are on my top 10 list.  They are fun and enjoyable for both children and adults and are about as close to the real story as they come.  I encourage people to watch both Joseph King of Dreams and The Prince of Egypt and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I have.,1196035200,,346,4.149253731343284
1404537,5,B000059H7A,These are a must have if you want your children to know bible stories.  They are well done with top quality animation and a real heart toward the bible message.

1404539,5,B000059H7A,"I watched these two movies years ago, and it still hasn't lost it's charm.

7933175,5,B000059H7A,"The product description says that this has both English and Hebrew for languages, and I bought it so I could watch it in Hebrew.  But when it arrived, it turned out that it only had English.  So if you're buying it specifically for its Hebrew sound band, sorry- this isn't what you're looking for.  But if you don't care about that, ""The Prince of Egypt"" is one of the most amazing, fantastic, astounding movies you will ever see/hear.  ""Joseph"" is great, too, although not quite as epic.",1372204800,,488,4.574712643678161

7933178,5,B000059H7A,Both movies are Bible stories that are well made.  Children enjoy them because they are cartoons and the music is wonderful.  These DVDs are great gifts.,1235174400,,153,4.846153846153846
7933179,5,B000059H7A,"If I could thank all who were involved in making these 2 movies I would.  This was movie magic at it's best.  These movies brought the bible to life for my 5 year old son and let him SEE the love that God has for us.  My son was so excited about learning the bible and tells the stories of Moses and Joseph to everyone. These two movies allowed me to further his teaching outside of movie time with added fun (example: he can now recite all 66 books of the bible, the 10 commandments, the 12 tribes of Isreal, and the 12 Apostles all in a fun way)  He's so pushy in making me tell him more and more stories out of the bible after seeing these two movies.  I even had to make him a ""Joseph Coat"", and a "" Moses Coat"" that he wears with pride.  I would recommend these movies without a second thought.  They are excellent!!!!  I hope more high quality movies are made in the future!!!!!",1233792000,,884,4.098837209302325
7933180,5,B000059H7A,"I love that they are biblical movies, even though they are not exact to the story of Moses and Joseph. My children ages 15, 11, 5, and 2 watch them over and over again. These are well thought out animations by Dreamworks. I particularly enjoy the lyrics to the songs and we sing along when watching these movies.",1224374400,,312,4.396551724137931
