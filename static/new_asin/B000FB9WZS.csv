There is a bit of added story with poison coming into play but not enough to distract too much from the story.",1430870400,2,273,4.074074074074074

8119857,3,B000FB9WZS,"This films o.k. Not bad, not great either. It runs on for way too long, and just doesn't deliver. The first 20-30 are enjoyable but then it levels off. I also enjoyed the final fight sequence which was good...not mind blowing, but definately enjoyed the final fight. The remake of this film called ""New Tales of the Flying Fox"" is great...5 stars! I highly recommend picking up the remake, a lot better than this one, not even close",1409788800,,432,4.551282051282051

8119859,1,B000FB9WZS,"I don,t know why amazon lets  companies or individuals sell dvd,s that are badly copied. One you could barely see or hear anything. Two can,t read sub titles,let alone see the movie. Its like watching in pitch darkness. I now realize that the movies amazon sell or sponsor from the shaw bros. kung fu genre classics if they are not digitally remastered from Dragon Dynasty-celestial pictures or Sword Masters also Funamation from Hong Kong Connection they are worthless like throwing your money away. P.S.thiis is the third horrible dvd that I purchased from amazom.",1374364800,,566,5.0212765957446805

8119861,5,B000FB9WZS,"Not sure why I'm surprised I enjoyed this so much. I love the Venom Mob movies and this was one of the best. There is a lot of plot thrown at you up front and I was definitely confused, though I suppose this is not rare for Chinese kung fu movies that want to dig in right away and not take the time to slowly set everything up. Actually, this movie was over two hours long, so there was definitely a lot going on! I just wanted to mention a few things.

Primarily I was overjoyed by Chin Siu-ho's performance as the lead character. I know him for Fist of Legend and Tai Chi Master, and wouldn't have thought of him as being a Shaw era performer. He was only seventeen years old when he did this! He was spectacular, and was one of my favorite performances to date of the typical young, overeager kung fu master who's emotions lead before his brain and skill. He did his fair share of laughing and boasting and rushing into danger, but had just enough patience to keep him from being annoying (I'm looking at you, Disciples of the 36th Chamber, grrr...). This was a very early performance in his career and I had no issues seeing him supported this time around by legends such as Lu Feng, Philip Kwok, and Chiang Sheng.

Lu Feng was a hero for once, and Chiang Sheng was a villain. Loved that. Philip Kwok did what he always did. Loved the action, the love story, the battle between the poison experts -- there was a lot going on and once I wrapped my head around it, I was thoroughly entertained!

This is not however a review for this specific disk.  My dvd was 122 minutes and subtitled.",1350864000,4,1590,4.29
8119862,4,B000FB9WZS,"I liked the fighting but wish it was also in english, but besides that, it was very good, including the plot.",1346803200,,109,4.238095238095238
8119863,4,B000FB9WZS,"This film falls in line with all the other great martial art films made by the Shaw Brothers great fighting but, the story line gets a little long and soapy but overall well worth it.",1167350400,5,183,4.257142857142857
