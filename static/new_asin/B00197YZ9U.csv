5901366,3,B00197YZ9U,"I have two Bolshoi versions with basically the same sets, choreography and costumes.  The crucial difference is the character of Spartacus.  I prefer the other version, with Irek Mukhamedov as the rebel leader.  I think he is a much better dancer--his turns are just faster, for example--and Mukhamedov is someone I wouldn't mind following into battle.

The Acosta version is a different situation.  To me, it seems that Acosta approaches each set of steps like an ice skater in one of those skating specatulars with Brian Boitano or Scott Hamilton.  There doesn't appear to be much continuity to Acosta's performance. Instead, he seems to be happy with executing his combinations while completely forgetting the Roman army that is lurking about.

Another thing.  The booklet in the Acosta version states:  ""From the moment he first appears on stage, presenting the highly charged image of a black man in chains, Acosta imbues the work with a depth and poignancy its creator could hardly have dreamt of, reinventing it for a new generation.""  Yeah, because the Russian people know nothing about slavery and oppression!  Especially during the Stalin era when ""Spartacus"" was created!",1301097600,6,1182,5.168421052631579
5901367,5,B00197YZ9U,"I watched Bolshoi ballet's ""Spartacus"" last night......a masterpiece and a showcase of bolshoi @ their best...form is flawless, technique is perfect, leaps are powerful, choreography difficult and intricate, and the unity is complete.

5901368,1,B00197YZ9U,"Lzlo Seregi, appointed chief choreographer for Hungarian State Opera Ballet in 1974 dreamed a dream of a Spartacus (1968)at least as good as Grigorovich's. He even succeded in having it danced by Australian Ballet(1990)and by its leading male dancer Steven Heathcote whose Des Grieux (1995) would be so beautifully danced! In this case it is really a minor third rate choreography with nothing but sought after brutality in it. Whereas with Grigorovich, the main role acquires depth and soul interacting with the other strong characters, this rather inferior choreography is just a pretext to a mere display of macho men dancing(not to be confused with the virility of the Bolshoi dancers led by Mukhamedov. A disaster.",1271203200,2,719,5.206896551724138
5901369,4,B00197YZ9U,"I'm afraid I must differ with the other eloquent reviewers.  I see a lot of ballets and, having just seen ""Spartacus"" with the Bolshoi in Washington, I must say the the 21-year old Alexei Vasiliev (I don't know if he's the son of Vladimir Vasiliev, but I suspect so) was the definitive ""Spartacus"".  His first-act entrance as a chained slave was heart-wrenching in its complete despair and his leaps made the entire audience gasp.  The rest of the cast was the same as this DVD and, though I'm quibbling with the lead, I definitely think this is a DVD to own.  The entire cast is spectacular and, I also must disagree about the Khatchaturian score.  I think it's wonderful in its portrayal of the action, though I agree the choreography isn't always up to it.  Overall, this is a wonderful buy and I can tell you that at the Kennedy Center, it rated 5 raucous encores, as well as spirited clapping between acts.  Everyone loved it, as they obviously do in Paris in the DVD.  So, I will continue to hope they do this again with Alexei Vasiliev, but this is the next best.",1268092800,2,1070,4.479381443298969
5901370,5,B00197YZ9U,"The first reviewer of this DVD, Hawkeye, essentially criticizes and condemns this Australian Ballet production of Spartacus for not being the Bolshoi production with choreography by Yuri Grigorovich. It uses, instead, a version created by Laszlo Seregi in 1968, which is interesting in part precisely because it is so different from the familiar Grigorovich. The Bolshoi version, like the Australian one, is based on a fictionalized account (the Bolshoi, on a novel by Rafaello Giovagnoli, the Australian on one by Howard Fast). However, the Bolshoi version makes the story somewhat abstract; the four principal characters dance monologues, and duets (Spartacus with Phrygia, Crassus with Aegina); otherwise, they are contrasted with groups, that they encourage, lead into battle (or lead in orgies), reluctantly dance with, or lose control of, but do not interact with. In addition, I  would venture to say that the Bolshoi version by itself does not make important story elements very clear; you need to read the playnotes for that. The Australian-Seregi version, on the other hand, almost never allows Spartacus or Crassus to be alone; they are always interacting, Spartacus with his fellow rebel leaders and with Flavia, Crassus with his companions. (The story is also much clearer and, I would say, more engagingly conveyed.) At the same time, the Australian dancers do fine jobs as actors--whereas in the Russian version the acting tends to be a bit...one-toned...--and so the overall effect of the Australian performance is a dance version of the story that I personally find more compelling and dramatic. --The reviewer mentioned above reproaches the Australian-Seregi version for not incuding the climactic hand-to-hand between Spartacus and Crassus. Isn't that like reproaching, say, the Latin language (or the Russian) for not having articles? That (very unhistorical) duel is not in the Seregi version, because it is not supposed to be; it's not part of that version of the story. However, if it is dance-fights you want, the first act is full of them, in the scenes that take place at the gladiator training school, and they are mighty fine, say I.",1238803200,15,2161,5.263768115942029

5901372,4,B00197YZ9U,"When Grigorovich took the challenge of choreographing Khachaturian's Spartacus - who had searched the story of this rebelled slave in Appian and Plutarch,more than in Giovaniolli's novel as basis for his ballet score -he would be the third choreographer to do so,after Yakobson in 1956 and Moiseev,in 58.
In 1963 he finally staged this 3rd productin of Spartacus,for Bolshoi. The leading role does demand an exceptional physically gifted dancer in order to give life to the extremely violent choreography with its ""jets"" and leap sequences,not to mention strength.

Carlos Acosta,internationally recognised ballet dancer,even foot injured,gives,live from Palais Garnier,an unforgettable interpretation of this demanding role,after Moscow and London. His generosity,his inner capability of giving the rebelious slave a soul trough dancing,is absolutely transcendent,and technically too,though injured.
His partenaire Kaptsova is neither Semenyaka nor Bessmertnova but portrays a fragile,tender Phrygia.
Allash's Aegina,quite convincing,follows Bilova's steps(she danced the two Mukhamedov versions).The weakest part is Volshkov's Crassus,far from being a cruel despot the role requires. Too young and light,is far away from Vetrov's energic,violent dancing. The orchestra...weak.

5901376,5,B00197YZ9U,"I am no ballet fan, but this Bolshoi 1950's production revived in Paris in 2007 is worthy of watching if you wish for a really nice production and some spectacular choregraphy.
The story is simple, with only four leads. In the title role is Spartacus, portrayed here by Cuban ballet dancer Carlos Acosta. As the Roman leader Crassus is Russian ballet dancer, and the two lady leads are both Russian. The supporting dancers are all from Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet troupe.
I like the production's classic attire and quasi-modern minimalist sets. They do well in presenting a concise, no non-sense support to the story-line, highlighting sufficiently the principals' portrayals without extraneous distractions.
In this very complementary set up, the four lead dancers all deliver spectacular performances.
As Crassus, the Russian dancer Alexander Volchkov owns marvelous stage presence, and a fully classic profile and rock solid ballet pyro-technique. His Crassus is rightly sub-dued in terms of technical prowess by the titular hero Spartacus, portrayed by the great Cuban ballet dancer Carlos Acosta, who owns a wildly masculine physic as well as great nimbleness. The technical demands of the role all appear to him a piece of cake. His chemistry with the ballerina Nina Kaptsova portraying Spartacus's wife Phrygia is tremendous.
As the Roman concubine and courtesan Aegina, Maria Allash, the principal ballerina of Bolshoi, is simply perfect in the role. Her alluring gestures and highly expressive communicative power depicts a vivid woman of unscrupulous ambition, a pivot for the rise and fall of powerful men.
While the choregraphy is first class, I regret to say that the same cannot be said of the music. Arma Khachaturian's score sounds repetitive and at times bordering on boring, and although it lends a balanced support to the choregraphy, it hardly enhances it.
The filming is reasonably good, if not outright perfect. Some close ups miss out the focus of the actions, but on the whole it is satisfying.
Warmly recommended.",1424563200,2,2034,5.2615384615384615
5901377,4,B00197YZ9U,"In the 1940's when I was entering puberty with it's ""raging hormones"" a most popular piece of music on the radio (no TV then) was by the Soviet composer Aram Khachaturian; his Ritual Fire Dance. His ballet ""Gayne' "" (1942) was all the rage with it's thump-thump rhythms. It's  crash, bang. biff, bam, zing, zang, bash of the Ritual Fire Dance, the Sword Dance etc. was just what a teenager would want. I listened to and played a lot of the Khachaturian's ouvre -  piano works, violin concerto etc. Even then it sounded like Hollywood film score music. Now in retrospect it seems marginal music at best and it joins too many other scores for ballet of that quality. I confess I haven't listened to Khachaturian since those long ago days but when I viewed this current disc all those memories came back.
Spartacus was written in 1956 and done at the Kirov (won a Lenin Prize in 1959) and at the Bolshoi in 1962. He quotes a lot from Gayne' ( a tale of struggle in Armenia) in Spartacus (a struggle in ancient Rome). In fact the love theme for Spatacus and Phrygia in the ballet Spartacus is the same as the love theme in Gayne'.
If anyone could make this trite offering come to life and gain in stature, it is Carlos Acosta. He has done himself proud in various discs he has made in the last several years e.g. Flames of Paris, Giselle, Manon etc. and now in Spartacus (2008). He is the perfect Premier Danseur  with his effortless lifts and even in the present disc a one-arm lift. He seems to communicate so well with his ballerina partners; it's almost magical. Then there is his extraordinary solo work; his athletic leaps and jumps and jette's. It's exciting just thinking about them. His leading lady here, Nina Kaptsova, is also a great dancer; she of the big expressive eyes. She is effortlessly  limber and enchanting to watch dance.
The handsome Alexander Volchkov plays the nemesis of Spatacus, Crassus. He is another excellent dancer who also commands the stage with leaps and turns. The final member of the team is Maria Allash. She did very well in her few solo parts and in her  act 3  monologue put new meaning into ""pole dance"" of scene 9.
The Bolshoi corps and soloists danced precisely and with verve; beautiful to watch. The ballet does show off the various soloists and it is an entertaining evening. The best section in my opinion is the pas de deux of Spartacus and Phrygia in Act 3 section 10  Spartacus Encampment. This is total delight of dance conveying deep emotion and the music here is good. This pas de deux so impressed Fonteyn that she included it in her repertoire.",1412726400,,2597,4.560085836909871

Anyone who thinks ballet dancers are delicate flowers is dead wrong.

5901383,5,B00197YZ9U,"The previous Bolshoi Ballet version of Spartacus was a marvellous production with marvellous dancing. Inevitably however, as recording techniques have developed, it clearly lacked the benefits of the modern technology. This new production therefore has strong claims to be considered seriously particularly bearing in mind the quality of the star dancers and the continuing high reputation maintained by the Bolshoi Corps de Ballet.

Acosta had been asked by the Bolshoi to dance the role of Spartacus for some years before it became possible to put this into action, such were the complications of timetabling. The role of Spartacus was a dream for Acosta and he sees this as the culmination of his career and a suitable high point before his retirement. As he was 35 years old at the time of this series of performances this was his last chance to fulfil his dream role, one that he identifies very closely with on all sorts of levels that he explains in the bonus interview.

The four previous star interpreters of the role brought different emphases' to the part. Vasiliev portrayed Spartacus as a thinker, Lavrovsky stressed machismo, Mukhamedov portrayed a selfless hero whereas Acosta concentrates on a lust for freedom. In his month's preparation for the role in Moscow, Acosta was coached by Lavrovsky who also stayed in the wings to give last minute guidance on the first night. Apparently the whole of the non-participating Bolshoi members watched the first performance from the wings, presumably in admiration as well as with curiosity.

This new Acosta version is very fine indeed with Acosta bringing a humanity as well as the lust for freedom to his interpretation of Spartacus as well as his considerable strength. This was recorded only 3 years after his fine portrayal of Romeo and the extra psychological dimension of that role may well have deepened his view of Spartacus.

Phrygia, as portrayed by Nina Kaptsova, makes a totally effective fragile partner who also demonstrates a considerable psychological strength to match that of Acosta. Her admiration for Acosta is clear in the bonus interview as she describes Acosta as that very rare thing - a real man.

Aegina is shown as a character of driven determination, a driving force  to match and support Crassus and is effectively portrayed by Maria Allash. Crassus, portrayed by Alexander Volchkov, also has strength of a tyrannical and cruel nature. His too is a physically demanding role with many leaps and turns plus the requirement to match Acosta's one-armed lift of Phrygia with his own of Aegina.

The corps de ballet offer exhilarating machismo choreography for the men with spectacular panoramic use of the whole stage area. The more feminine choreography provided for the female corps also makes telling use of the large stage area. This awareness of spectacle is a characteristic of Grigorovich's choreography and is at its most spectacular in this ballet. Large scale synchronised dancing such as seen here is something of a speciality of this ballet company and is carried out with telling precision on this recording.

There are two interesting bonuses included in the form of the 'Making of Spartacus' headed mainly with the four star dancers, the choreographer Grigorovich and director Ratmansky covering this production of Spartacus. It includes rehearsal sequences inter-cut with performance extracts. There is also an interview specifically with Acosta which makes an interesting biographical resume of his career.

The camera work of this recording is excellent giving a nice balance between detailed close shots and panoramic views. The sound is offered in excellent DTS-HD surround and stereo.

Overall I would strongly recommend this production as unlikely to be surpassed for a long time and where the technical advantages of a good modern recording are so apparent. These attractions are likely to be more than sufficient to balance any perceived shortcomings where ballet enthusiasts have developed strong loyalties to particular productions and interpretations over repeated viewings of earlier recordings.

Owners of earlier recordings will have the luxury of owning yet another fine interpretation to add to them while newcomers will have the pleasure of owning an example of an outstanding modern interpretation given a fine modern recording. For these reasons it seems reasonable to recommend this as a 5 star modern addition to a fine sequence of memorable recordings.",1343520000,4,4474,5.2521008403361344

As for Bolshoi, they certainly is able to cast a Russian dancer in the title roleNicolai TBolshoi principal in that era will certainly do the trick.
Not that Ascota isn't capable, far from that, but to a good extent his Spartacus failed to take centre stage in the various Acts, being upstaged in turns by the three Bolshoi solists Nina Kaptsova as Phrygia, Maria Allash as Aegina and lastly Alexander Volchkov as Crassus.
Some reviewers claimed that Volchkov is the weaklink in this performance.  This is very inaccurate stemming from a mere historical but not dramatic understanding of this role.
Crassus is an oppressor, but by no means a simpleton, with a complex character under the influence of an ambitious woman Aegina.  Volchkov gives a multi-dimensional portrayal of an unstable and obsessive character. The orgy scene is particularly vivid.
In terms of dancing, the three Bolshoi soloists showed amply that theirs is not merely physical prowess but skilful deployment of inner emotional manifestations of the different demands of their characters. Ascota is comparatively flat in his portrayal compared with the three Bolshoi leads.
In total, this is still a winning performance, especially when you have the marvellous Kaptsova and capable Allash in the two lady roles, accompanied by the Bolshoi golden boy Alexander a Volchkov.",1430352000,,1473,5.158995815899582
