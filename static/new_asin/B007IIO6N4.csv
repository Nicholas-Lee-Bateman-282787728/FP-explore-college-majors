5089057,2,B007IIO6N4,"I am very sad to announce that the quality of the product is very poor. On disk 1 the English subtitles don't work, on many disks (particularly 6) the video is terrible, and on disk 9 it just randomly cuts out of the credits.
However, I contacted my seller and they are taking the disks I have returned to them and going through to fix the problems and make it perfect for the future.
I am very appreciative of all of the work that they are willing to do for the quality of this item and for the satisfaction of future buyers.",1347840000,,526,4.166666666666667
5089058,1,B007IIO6N4,"Though I am unsure how relevant this would be to amazon, seeing the description as well as the picture of the case, I felt I had to speak. I bought this exact thing on ebay as a bit of a birthday present to myself.

The quality of both picture and audio are terrible, explaining how this can all fit into 8 DVDs. From what I've seen so far, all items are in the DVDs as said. It's just if you want something cheap and now and don't want to spend weeks torrenting this yourself, go ahead. But if you want quality, go buy the real thing. Don't hop on this because it looks like a good price like I did. Lesson learned.",1344816000,12,616,4.049180327868853
8517541,1,B007IIO6N4,"I didn't order this, but wow, this HAS to be a bootleg (illegal copy)..... I don't think they ever released the whole series in one set, and if they did, it would need more discs. I used to think only Ebay had bootlegs but I've been seeing a lot on Amazon now that I know what looks fishy. :/",1431043200,,292,3.9661016949152543
8517542,1,B007IIO6N4,"If I could give ZERO stars I would. It stated some of the discs were in a English Version and all the discs were to have English subtitles. No true, all of the discs were in Japanese. The picture quality was horrible. Save your money to buy the original versions.",1430611200,,263,4.28
8517543,3,B007IIO6N4,Not all of the dvd's have the language and subtitle options that are advertised.,1421107200,4,80,4.785714285714286
8517544,4,B007IIO6N4,"I should have known this was a bootleg box set, but I thought it was worth it. The quality of the episodes is decent, the movies look even better. There are gaps in the subtitles at times, but if you've seen the series as many times as I have, it's not a huge issue. I do like that all the episodes plus the movies were only on 9 discs!",1417737600,2,336,3.8840579710144927
8517545,5,B007IIO6N4,I'm so happy I got it! I love Sailor Moon! I do recommend this and the people I bought from are awesome!,1374796800,,104,3.772727272727273
8517546,5,B007IIO6N4,I love it because I saw with my friends when I was a child now my nieces and nephews will enjoy it. I will recomend it.,1366761600,,119,3.6153846153846154
8517547,5,B007IIO6N4,Getting these dvds of the COMPLETE series and movies really made my day. The quality is good just like I used to watch on my television. There was even a bonus DVD in my package. There was quick shipping as well. The only problem was that they would not play on my DVD player but that was minor as they played in my computer. If you can I highly recommend buying this awesome set!,1360627200,,380,4.148648648648648
8517548,5,B007IIO6N4,I never got to see the last season growing up. Why was it ban from america? But all I know is this is a good anime. Love all the episodes and the movies. Got what I paid for. Anyone who loves Sailor Moon this dvd is worth it.,1358121600,,225,3.7083333333333335
8517549,5,B007IIO6N4,I am so very happy with this set. I am seeing episodes that weren't released in the USA. Good quality!,1354924800,,102,4.15

Arrived in good shape and was on time. Also included 3 movies which was a bonus",1348617600,,154,4.535714285714286
