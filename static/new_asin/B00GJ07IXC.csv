8623680,5,B00GJ07IXC,"LOST IN THAILAND is billed as China's highest grossing film of all time and I can see why. It stars three of China's top comedic actors with a cameo by one of China's top actresses Fan Bingbing.
Two coworkers Xu (Xu Zheng) and Bo (Huang Bo) are fiercely competing over control of  the ""Super Gas"" formula that dramatically increases the volume of a liquid. A couple of drops in your fuel tank dramatically increases the amount of gas. One of them needs to reach Mr. Zhou, the company's largest shareholder, to authorize further funding for the research. The catch is the person who finds Zhou gets to keep his job. The loser is fired. And so begins a wild and wacky adventure that takes us on a wild journey into lovely and exotic Thailand.
On the flight to Thailand, Xu is seated next to his worst nightmare-Wang Bo (Baoqiang Wang).
Wang is out to cross things on his bucket list while on honeymoon with his actress wife Fan Bingbing. Never mind that he has never met her. His childlike innocence can be both annoying and endearing. Needless to say, a comedy of errors unite Xu and Wang throughout the movie as Xu tries to evade the ever present Bo. Despite his best intentions, Wang constantly thwarts Xu's progress in fining Mr. Zhou.
This is old style comedic slapstick with a lot of sight gags and innuendo that never are what they seem. Thailand's famous ""ladyboys"" are a reoccurring theme as Wang has no idea that these gorgeous ""women"" are actually men. He is precious in his innocence. When Xu tries to steal Bo's passport, he ends up in the wrong room and has to hide under the bed. As the bed violently bounces above him, we assume one thing is happening and the hilarity is it's not exactly what we thing.
Xu may be mean to Wang and is using him but we see the warmth and affection developing. LOST IN THAILAND is a lovely journey into friendship. I enjoyed this film immensely. I used to work subtitling films so I was disappointed in the quality of the subtitles (typos and a few translations that were not clear) but the film is delightful and entertaining and should not be missed.",1448236800,2,2097,4.518421052631579

The movie is funny and has a good meaning. It's a fun flick, and reminds me of my many memorable travels to Thailand.",1429747200,,257,5.0
