#1 THE MOTION PICTURE

#2 GREAT

#3 PREMIUM

#4 RETURN

#5 GORGEOUS

They are in slim packs, and looks like they have no extras like they did when originally released.  So definitely do not double dip, or sell off the old ones to buy these.  Other than that, you get all US released movies in one shot at a reasonable price.",1127952000,36,400,4.226666666666667
2385604,4,B000ADKWMS,"I love all things slayers! Next to Ranma 1/2 it's one of my favorite comedic series.

I just wish they told you exactly WHICH movies are in this since fans like myself may not want to buy twice...",1127865600,,196,4.157894736842105
8077951,4,B000ADKWMS,"The Slayers movies are hilarious take on european medieval fantasy. (Think an anime based on a LOTR crack fanfiction  where the proagonists are more interested in get rich quick schemes and chest size insults than saving the world.) While I do enjoy the TV series, I prefer the Lina/Naga dynamic more. The movies themselves are near perfect, nothing ""deep"", but still highly enjoyable, complete with regular breaking of the 4th wall, pathetic wannabe dark lords, mock Kaiju battles, etc. I would give this collection a 5 but movies 1, 2, and 4 are Letterboxed, which means it will not fill up a HDTV screen, and is surrounded on all sides by Black bars. Movie 3 is 4:3, and movie 5 is true 16:9 widescreen, so these were fine. If you've got the cash (these are out of print) I'd reccomend buying this set.",1489104000,2,805,4.629370629370629

8077953,5,B000ADKWMS,"I bought this boxset recently and I highly recommend it. There are 4 prequel movies and 1 that takes place during the tv series. The last movie Slayers Premium is the one that takes place in the tv series relm is my favorite of the films but it's only a half an hour sadly. The Manga version of Slayers premium though is soooo much better. The First Four Movies are amazing and very funny yet very different from the show. They only feature Lina and Naga as leads and that's it. The first movie is the best of the prequels which is called The Motion Picture. The second film Slayers Return is also very good. The third film Slayers Great is my second favorite of the prequels and it's the funniest Slayers anything. The 4th film is slayers gorgeous and i ended up liking it more than I thought i would because a lot of fans don't like it. I found it hilarious although the animation was a bit sub par for a movie.

Slayers The Motion Picture is 66 minutes long and the darkest of the five
Slayers Return is 60 Minutes and is more zany and funny than the first film
Slayers Great is 60 Minutes and is the funniest of all 5 films. I couldn't stop laughing.
Slayers Gorgeous is 60 minutes and a bit anticlimactic in some parts yet still funny as heck
Slayers Premium is a 30 Minutes and is the only one of the five movies to feature Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadis despite the boxset cover art.

I highly recommend these films but the price can be steep because this set is out of print. Good luck in your quest for it.",1424563200,,1512,4.246527777777778
8077954,5,B000ADKWMS,"Wow what a great set. Don't let the price turn you away! This set of movies is awesome! I only recently got into the Slayers series by just randomly watching a few episodes on Netflix but, upon further research and more trailer views I decided to give it a shot since the rest of the reviews are good. I went out on a whim and purchased this set to see the first stories of Lina Inverse and they did not dissapoint. The humor and action are just what I expected and more. Although Lina's voice actress is different from the anime series in the first 4 movies, you grow to like the character just as much. Naga the Serpent is great in always comparing herself to Lina and claiming she's better, even though it's clear who the real sorceress master of elements is. Is it Lina?? You decide!! Anywho, can't say I'm dissapointed by this set. The stories are good and sometimes just down right ridiculous. When a couple of giant stone robots are fighting each other at the will of their masters, over a petty sowing competition that's been going on for years, what more can you say? The voice acting is great and the action is always going on in one way or another. The Slayers never dissapoint and keep things lively. Not many animes have kept my attention like Slayers has. There are nothing but good things I can say about the movies. Sure, it may not be as revered as say Dragonball Z or Yu Yu Hakusho,  but Lina Inverse herself is a force to be reckoned with! No other female protaginist is as sure of herself or so confident as Lina. At least not for the time it was released. If you are just curious or wondering of this set is worth the big bucks, then I'd say ""Yes!"" You begin to crave more and just pop in the next movie to see more of the adventures of Line and Naga. I only saw the first 4 movies because I'm watching the series as a whole in chronological order so I don't miss a beat. The last movie is suppose to be with Gourry and the adventurers Lina meets in the anime series, so Zelgadus and Gourry are out of the majority of the films but, despite this fact, the characters are just as good and entertaining as ever. Go ahead and take a chance! Dragon Slave it up!",1416009600,,2178,4.260869565217392
8077955,4,B000ADKWMS,"Slayers OAV hard to come by a decent anime that isn't main stream. Very fun, very different from the 'series' version of Slayers. Deffinately worth the purchase and great if you have Slayers/Next and Try in your collection.",1383350400,,223,4.894736842105263
8077956,5,B000ADKWMS,"SLAYERS is a classic anime that is nearly perfect, either the TV series, the OVAs or this case, the movies. The adventures of Lina Inverse never grow old. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and always laugh at the same jokes, always root for the hero, because it's that well done. The movie box includes all 5 movies produced between 1995 and 2001, the first four feature the misadventures of Lina with her self entitled rival, Naga as they fight villains, search for treasure and blow up everything that gets in thei way. The fifth movie is a sequel to the TV series, so it features a whole different, but just as carismatic, group of heroes. To make it clear: the adventures of Lina and Naga happen before the TV series, where Lina joins forces with Gourry, the swordsman, Amelia, the overentusiastic hero wannabe and Zelgadis, the tormented human/demon/golem. I fiercely recommend this (and he other series available) if you're a fan of medieval fantasy, slapstick comedy, great storytelling and a lot of explosions. You can NEVER go wrong with SLAYERS.",1285891200,,1072,4.768817204301075
8077957,4,B000ADKWMS,"My favorite Slayers is the television series, but the OVA/movies are mighty fine entertainment in and of themselves with no larger stories or arcs to follow; just a string of hilarious episodic mayhem and slapstick comedy.  Slayers is among my favorite anime series' and Lina is a fantasy anime icon that all should know well.  This is a nice little set that compiles the 5 films of this classic anime series which take place before the first season of the television show.  My only complaint is that the awesome OVA's ""Excellent"" and ""Book of Spells"" aren't included.  Personally, those are my favorites of the non-television releases and with them, this set would've gotten 5 stars easily.  On to the review. ""Slayers: The Motion Picture"" is a really fun flick and a decent introduction to Slayers.  It features a younger Lina Inverse, sorcery genius and master of the dreaded Dragon Slave technique (which she often has used to lay waste to entire cities) coming across co-collaberator/rival sorceress Naga the Serpent and the excessive fanservice that always accompanies her.  As usual with the two of them, chaos ensues.  The story features the best villain in all of Slayers anime lore in the demon Joyrock and is the longest and most epic of this bunch.  ""Slayers: Great"" is my favorite of the films. The plot revolves around feuding father and son golem makers. It features first a duel between the two (anti) heroines with hilarious results and then a duel between Lina and Naga golems with even more hilarious results.  ""Slayers: Premium"" is the odd duck of the series since it features the cast of the television series and is a very short 30 minutes.  That's not to say we don't see a glimpse of Naga in the closest we'll ever get to a crossover between Lina's two lives, but let's just say it's an underwhelming affair.  Not worth much on it's own, but as part of this set, I'd take it.  ""Slayers Return"" is a fun little romp that introduces a lot of cool characters who share very little screen time.  The story is about a village enslaved by an organization consisting of two people who seek world domination.  You've gotta aim high, right?  When an ancient weapon is unearthed the madness tht ensues is pure Lina and Naga.  ""Slayers: Gorgeous"" is more derivative then the rest and seems to have slipped into a creative rut as we see a lot of the same gags and plot devices Slayers fans have seen before, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth your while.  After all, this one features a dragon army.  That's a good start to any fantasy flick, wouldn't you say?  The set as a whole is incomplete in my eyes without the aforementioned OVA's, but if fantasy anime and slapstick comedy are your bag then you should buy this set along with ""Book of Spells"", ""Slayers: Excellent"", and the television series and get ready for countless laughs.  If you're unsure about this series, give ""Excellent"" a try as it's probably the best of the OVA releases.  If you likey, there's plenty more where that came from right here!",1177545600,12,3025,4.700189753320683
8077958,5,B000ADKWMS,"Let me just say why buy the movies individualy when you can just get the collection set in one box.

All of these movies are great and the girls are even hotter I mena their bodies are banging. I love seeing them fight monsters back in midevil times.

My favorite movie is ""Slayers Next"" it follows the handsome red hair girl Lina who has special powers and their friends, Amelia, blond guy Gourry and the weird Zelgadis who has stones in his face. They fight evil demons for cash.",1152057600,,481,4.393258426966292
8077959,4,B000ADKWMS,"I'm a long-time fan of Slayers and would recommend the three main series ""Slayers"" ""Slayers Next"" and ""Slayers Try"" because they are phenomonal in creation, story, and design.  These OVAs, with the exception of The Motion Picture, are not as great, and do not use the original voice of Lina for younger Lina.

These, for the most part (except for Premium) take place prior to the main series, although Lina's exact age isn't revealed (15 in the trilogy).  They are fun, zany, and Lina and Naga get into all sorts of scrapes.

Premium and The Motion Picture are the best of the set...and anything with Ghourry is good.",1145577600,3,617,4.685185185185185
8077960,4,B000ADKWMS,"I Had not yet puchased any of the movies/specials and when this set came out I was delighted!  Lets first start by saying this set includes: Slayers The Motion Picture, Slayers Return, Slayers Great, Slayers Gorgeous, and Slayers Premium.  All Movies are in Widescreen Presentation Except for Slayers Great.  Slayers The Motion Picture, is the Essential Anime Disc release so it comes with commentary.  Slayers Premium Also has a behind the scenes interview and Commentary.  The other DVDs only come with it's trailer and ADV previews.

My only regret in this set is that while this box includes most of the Movies, it still did not come with Slayers Excellent, and The book of Spells DVD.  I don't understand why it didn't come with Excellent, but The Movies it did include are great to watch!  I reccomend this if you have bought the series, but haven't gotten around to purchasing any of the Movies yet, just remember to purchase Excellent and Book of Spells to complete your Collection!",1128902400,31,990,4.851190476190476
