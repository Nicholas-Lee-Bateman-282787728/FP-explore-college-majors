1270499,3,B00003CXO3,When I went to the theatre to watch this movie I did not expect a movie with a very intellectual plot.  All I wanted to see is a fun action movie with good fighting scenes.  If the director for this movie could have developed the story line better I would give this movie 4 or 5 star.  Stallone did a good job carrying this movie.  I did not like how they were trying to make Carter(Stallone) be a bad guy and a good guy.  Even though I am giving this movie 3 star I will still buy the DVD because I liked the action in this movie.,978652800,4,531,3.925233644859813

1270812,5,B00003CXO3,"The original ""Get Carter"" was a brilliant, gritty English film from 1971 starring Michael Caine. This 2000 reboot is excellent.  Critics panned this film, I suspect, because it stars Sylvester Stallone.  It's true that Stallone plays a tough guy.  But here he is a tough guy and not an action hero.  The character Carter gets his ass kicked in a fair fight. Something that the ""Franchise"" Stallone would never permit.  Stallone nails his character of a conflicted mob guy with personal baggage. I also really like the background atmosphere of Seattle. The cast is great and includes Rachael Leigh Cook, Mickey Rourke, Alan Cumming, Rhona Mitra and of course, Michael Caine.

1270974,5,B00003CXO3,"A breath of fresh air and welcome second look at a flawed classic.

I liked this new film a lot. The updated treatment was in my view perfectly judged and supportive of - let's face it - the rather slim and implausible basis of the original story which demands a great deal of imagination to accept its characterisations and wooden plot. This remake which is essentially an Americanization pulls in the contemporary drugs trade and corrupt nature of the internet bubble and with a raft of excellent performances in all the key roles really works well.

The score and in particular the musical development of the Get Carter theme is slick and incredibly well done, as is the rest of the score with contributions by Moby, carried out by Tyler Bates. This is a major benefit of the updating.

In fact the whole film is business like and tight and starts with an exciting thump and continues efficiently with no drop out whereas the original screenplay tended to wander and lose pace at times - the scene in the country house estate is for example laughable and reminiscent of a weak episode in the of the TV series The Avengers with Patrick MacNee.

The principal role of the avenging brother is actually just about carried off with equal honours by both Caine and Stallone in my view. Though it is Stallone who brings more weight and acting finesse to the role. I know this comment will shock the Brit film fan base who can see nothing wrong in his cardboard performances in The Italian Job and this. It has to be sustained over 90 plus minutes and both manage to do this. Michael Caine reached an early summit of his career with this role (and a couple of others from the same period) and his career has steadily declined since into endless walk on minor roles, low budget and just awful mistakes - arguably without much world wide impact, except for the tedious regularity with which it continued to happen.. Having just experienced his latest ""contribution"" in the total disaster of ""Interstellar"" - a film which promised so much technically in genuine 70mm non-digital format then threw it away - and Caine's dying role in a dying film, one's mouth literally drops open to the reality that a hundred cameos like this has proven time after time that he has sustained a career on the slenderest of acting resources and screen charisma .

It therefore amazes me when people are so quick to run down Stallone and big Caine up in this role. Stallone comes to this role on the back of a world recognised celebrity brand, a string screen image and all the credentials to do well in the part - including experience. He has worked hard - beyond humanly hard - to get to this role. And there are scenes where it shows:

The scenes with Stallone and Rachel Leigh Cook concerning the abuse she suffered are genuinely moving and beyond anything produced by Caine in his wooden interactions in the 1960s film. This is great acting. There has been a lot of this on film, but none done so well in my view than here. Those who detest Stallone (and there are a lot out there) this film will probably confirm rather than change their view, but those who maintain that Stallone can't act to save his life might want to look at this particular scene a few times and then might be dissuaded. It really is excellent.

In the Hodges film there is not a believable female role in the whole film and the landlady scene at Caine's grotty lodgings in Newcastle (typical of the rundown approach of the South to the North) is a seaside postcard harrigan of a caricature of a Northern lass - I suppose she had big tits too. It's pretty true to form of the whole sexist mood of the movie and the era....not in reality, because it was never like this really, it has always been a Southern caricature of Northern England. It was a stereotype then and a cliche now which I do not find very amusing to find be praised up as a great British film. The only Britain being portrayed here is one for outside consumption for people who either live in the South or do not live in the country at all. Very cynical and as exploitative as so-called shoot 'em up films today. This is in Mike Hodges film the snotty nosed attitude towards the North of England viz London and the ""Smoke"" - the North/South divide - a sort of ethnic demographic superiority - which has been the bane of the UK and accounts for much of the country's present problems relative to its European partners where national integration and inclusion via excellent infra-structure have created unified states with less inequality, a fairer and more equitable spread of employment, higher productivity, opportunities and investment, plus a cultural readiness to modernise and engage globally rather than break one's neck collectively facing and glorifying in the past. The original Carter film did not so much document a problem, as become part of it. The participation of John Osborne - inexplicably - as a Northern ""Richardson"" or ""Kray"" is again part and parcel of the lack of clarity in this screenplay, one would like an explanation as to how this supports the plot. I presume Osborne played the role out of his hand in writing the screen play alongside Hodges out of the original very slim novel which is almost a fragment. It's thoroughly old fashioned even for the year it was released harking back to the 1950s where Osborne's world view was formed.

The Stallone update sees through all this very clearly, as petty social class based snobbery, and clears it all out the way with one sweep of the hand into the rubbish bin where it belongs. The result is to allow the characters to breath and the plot to gain a sort of current credibility. Out of the film's critical reception I have copied this selection from Wiki that gives a representative flavour:

Among the positive reviews, JoBlo.com praised ""the sharp turn given by Sly Stallone, its groovy tunes, and its generally dark and gritty nature.""[3] Rob Blackwelder of SPLICEDWire called the film ""a stimulating visual showcase of stylish film making that keeps a viewer's attention.""[4] Chuck O'Leary of FulvueDrive-in.com said that ""the original Get Carter is better, but this is quite watchable as far as modern-era remakes go"".[5]

Shawn Levy of the Portland Oregonian gave an average review, saying that while ""the film doesn't touch the original, it doesn't hit rock bottom, either.""[6] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said the film is ""not a terrible movie"" but ""too routine for its own good.""[7] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said that ""the film itself is a muddle, but what is good is Stallone"".[8] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle said the film ""is murkier than it needs to be, through no fault of Stallone's"".[9]

Among the negative reviews, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film ""a useless remake.""[10] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said that the film is ""so minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world's first movie without even a text"".[11] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News called the film ""a throwaway story hidden beneath a messy jumble of weird camera angles, worthless editing tricks and an ill-placed, obnoxious score"".[12]

The film was nominated for Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone) and Worst Remake or Sequel at the Golden Raspberry Awards in 2000.[13]

As I stated, the original novel is a mere fragment. The 1971 Hodges film was itself a muddle worked up from that short story. And I side with the more favourable reviews at the beginning.

In particular ""the messy jumble of weird camera angles and worthless editing tricks"" I find just a barbed attack on something you don't like anyway. After all most of these tricks can be seen in any recent film. The editing of the film was with the soundtrack and overall excellent cast which is far and above the 1971 cast, one of the film's special benefits - it has a strong visual impact in strictly cinematic terms. We are not talking about carefully composed fine art visual pictures. But great camera work and post production of an action movie, or a story on the go...there is a pace and forward momentum in this Get Carter from Stephen Kay which I find irresistible. The cross edited, very fast, flashback mode, lift scene, at the end of which you never really know what actually happened, is mind blowing. When Stephen Kay slows it down does so to make a point - usually a very profound point about human nature and the ageless but seemingly modern conventions (the corporate foundation) by which dirty money cleanses itself of any moral responsibility.

And what a trio of great supporting roles and performances we are given from Micky Rourke, Alan Cummings and John C. McGinley. While Sylvester Stallone's acting may never form a cultural triumph of Western civilization, he generates an on screen buzz that holds your attention. This is Rourke at a pre ""Wrestler"" stage: he IS the unredeemable double crossing thug. Alan Cummings IS the slimy nerdish button pushing creep where value and money have totally separated in the electronic ether. You get a glimpse here of Margaret Thatcher's wished for future: a country of NO society, only the faceless corporation and the family. Nothing in between.

Tremendous - definitely NOT a rotten tomato, it is a peach of a film.

If I were handing out the rotten tomatoes I would give them to the 1971 Caine movie for stereotyping and stigmatization of the North of England - thoroughly disgraceful - but thankfully superseded by this.",1417651200,,9535,4.723992784125075

Jack starts snooping around after he finds out that his brother Richie might have been murdered.  Jack keeps digging and he certainly feels he is not welcome at home.  Richie's daughter tells him that her dad would not drink and drive.

Jack is in a hurry to get done in Seattle as his partner is covering for him being missing in Vegas and he is pushing him to get back before the mob boss finds out that he is missing.  The big boss in Vegas is not the only person there who might be missing Carter, so is the boss's girl friend with whom Carter is having an affair with. Jack is visiting Richie's boss and viewing the tapes from the bar that Richie managed.  Jack digs into the world of porn and finds out the reason Richie was taken out, now he wants vengeance....

This movie is all about Stallone being a real bad and tough guy.  He wants vengeance for his brother's death and he won't stop until he is satisfied that all of those involved have paid the price.  This movie is just an average movie to me.  It had a lot of potential and a good cast but it just never really got out of the gate as far as action and suspense goes.  Don't get me wrong there is action but it is separated with too much conversation and Stallone is good for one liners but not for in depth conversations.

Sure it is tough, gritty-lensed, gray, and Stallone faux-menacing (not in that suit)and with comfortably known cast to make it more appealing, and a decent action packed good guy vs, bad guys film. All of that and its still not even close to the genuine rawness of the original, the allure then demise of that beautiful woman (drowned in the trunk of her own car Caine watches listlessly), Caine's meticulously planned and heartless revenge (how he did in big guy despite the big guy's already dooming Caine was truly clever), the aloof nature of his relationship to his niece, and, of course, the final shot that clarifies life in the British underworld (like Sexy Beast).

Michael Caine can out-act Sly Stallone but he can't out-enertain him: I nver saw the 1971 original but Stallone, like John Wayne before him, eats up each frame, dominating the enterprise, kicking up a few notches, to use that millenium cliche.

Glad he was on hand, because this one of those could-shoulda-been-alot-better deals: seemingly, at every turn Carter's behavior is criticized and analyzed by his exasperated sister-in-law and her teenage daughter. Another example of militant feminism being injected into a plotline that is really pitched to those men and women who like to watch a macho guy snarl, growl, kick, and smash down.

Very effective musical soundtrack, with Groove Armada's ""If Everybody Looked The Same"", the stand-out. [Though not on the actual soundtrack album - check out Groove Armada's ""Vertigo"" CD].",1276819200,2,866,5.352941176470588

""Get Carter"" is about Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) returning home to pay his respects to his brother who died. While home, Jack discovers that his brother may not have died due to drunk driving. This triggers a full investigation. (Stallone style)

""Get Carter"" has a good plot, but I think because Stallone was the star of the film, there was a need to focus on action and by doing this, the plot was secondary.

He battles old enemies like Cyrus Pace (Mickey Rourke), an Internet porn purveyor and new ones like a shady club owner (original Carter Michael Caine), and a wimpy computer entrepreneur (Alan Cumming). I guess I never realized how terrible Stallone is. You can't understand a word he says and the man doesn't grasp subtlety. He lumbers around looking awkward during emotional scenes. Thankfully the supporting cast proves much more exciting. Caine, as always, is classy and fun and Cumming is too. The draw here is Mickey Rourke.

Having seen both versions, I could not disagree more.  The Stalloneversio production has a complex and dark Jack Carter seeking to right an injustice and save his estranged family.  The Caine version has a more campy hit man type Jack Carter that is dated in the same way that certain 60s British Spy characters appear today.

Carter (Stallone) is basically a bad guy who doesn't want to be a bad guy, a midlevel mob enforcer who it seems gotten into his current lifestyle and occupation rather unwittingly some years ago and now can't find a way out.  It never says that in the movie, but that's what I got right from the beginning.  He seems resigned to his role until the death of his brother brings him home to his estranged family for the first time in years, where he becomes suspicious that his brother's death wasn't an accident.  When his sister-in-law and niece begin to be terrorized by some unknown assailants, Carter goes on the warpath against whoever's after them and whoever killed his brother, turning his violence loose without reserve.  The bond he forms with his niece (played by Rachel Leigh Cook in a big change of pace from her comedic roles) seems to galvanize his courage to not only pursue his current targets but to re-evaluate his whole life and the choices he's made and the position as a common thug he's lived in during recent years.  Very effective use of inner drama intermixes with tension and top-of-the-line fight scenes to make this a cut above many similar movies.

""Bad brother"" and occupational debt collector returns home after 5 years to attend his younger ""good brother's"" funeral.

Stallone makes up for his failure to be a part of the family these past few years by getting to the bottom of things and ""making things right"".

Why was Sylvester Stallone's character estranged from his murdered brother?  And why after five years does he take such an aggressive murdering stand to avenge his murdered brother's death and niece's rape? Even Syrus played by Mickey Rourke questions this.

Little is explained about the events that led to Jack Carter's brother's murder.  A few scene's of gruesome flashbacks and endless chatter of this disc that the brother had do not get to the point of what led to this murder.

The nerve racking car chase and fight scenes even seem hard to follow. The final confrontation between Stallone and Rourke is strangely scripted with Rourke beating Stalone bloody.  Five minutes later Stalone stagers to where Rourke is dancing with sleazy women and is able to muster the strength to beat down his adversary.

DeMille remade his 1925 movie The Ten Commandments in 1956 It is a timeless story and will no doubt be done again in the future. Some movies have great stories that are worth retelling. An example is A Star is Born which was first filmed in 1937. It was remade in 1954 and in 1976. Sometimes, a producer will buy the rights to a foreign film in order to do an English language version. Three Men and a Baby was a remake of a French film. All too often, however, remakes happen for reasons that are logical only to the people who decide to do them. Get Carter is one of those movies. The original an English film released in 1971. It starred Michael Caine, who also appears in the new version, perhaps as a reminded that, most of the time, what was successfully done in the past is best left there.
Jack Carter, originally Caine's character, is this time played by Sylvester Stallone. Carter is a very bad man, which worked perfectly the first time around. Why the producers decided to tone the character down for modern audiences is beyond me. He is still unsavory, but that's not the same thing as being bad to the bone. The result is that this Carter is far less interesting.
After working in Las Vegas for five years as a debt enforcer for a casino boss, Carter returns home to Seattle after his brother is killed in a car accident. He finds the circumstances of the death to be suspicious. A little checking around shows that some of the people the brother knew have a lot to hide. Soon, several of them have reason to fear Carter, who, after all, is all too familiar with their shady little world. The trick for Carter in this dark little thriller is to find out what his brother might have known that cost him his life.
Get Carter is literally one of the darkest films I have seen in years. Director Stephen T. Kay wants to make sure we get in the mood of the story. I was yearning for a little sunshine long before the movie ended.
I will note that Stallone gives a more subtle and nuanced performance than usual. If the producers were determined to do this remake, then Stallone was a good choice for the lead. Besides Caine, the movie also stars two of my favorite British actors - Miranda Richardson and Alan Cummin, both playing Americans. Richardson adds class to the picture, but her role is hardly a stretch for her. Add Cummin to a growing list of English actors who have learned how to play American villains better than Americans themselves. As a vain, self-centered zillionaire, Cummin's character is delightfully nasty.
This movie is not the worst choice you could make to spend an evening with. Had the original never existed, reviewers probably would have been kinder. The fact is that it suffers by comparison. If you like your thrillers dark and on the nihilistic side, you might enjoy this, but if you can find a copy of the original, by all means watch it instead.",1016323200,8,3064,4.483005366726297

The setting of this one is rainy Seattle and Sly, dressed like ""Frank Sinatra"" does a great job with this updated script, which keeps the original plot intact, keeping it a stylish action film with heart and mind.  Michael Caine even has a role as one of the many bad guys Sly takes on.
  The ending is a significant departure from the original, this time being how we WANT it to end.  It could be that with ""Copland"" and this Sly has found his midlife muse, really the same as he always was:  the brooding tough guy with heart and soul.

""Get Carter"", also a remake, is following a similar linear story line and gritty atmosphere but is failing in that the movie producers decided to make the Sylvester Stallone's character likable (being Stallone, I guess).  And this is where it slips for the worst.  Why did they have to put so much (twisted) morality in this guy?  The scene I really hated is when Carter throws the bartender who abused his niece by the window after he tells him ""what would you think if it was your daughter"" and ""you already killed yourself (by abusing his niece and other women)"".

I have been a fan of Stallone for as long as I can remember and at fifty years old the guys still got it.  Director Stephen Kay has given this film a unique look that I love.  But those expecting an action flick you might be dissapointed.  This film is more of a hard edged thriller.  The film was almost perfectly cast with Stallone, Miranda Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook, Michael Caine and Mickey Rourke.  The only downside was Alan Cummings try at the young millionare software tycoon.  The films main downfall was the script and a few plot holes but I was able to overlook them.

This movie is about a man who tries to come back to a family (his brother's) who he walked out on so many years ago. The only connection his niece has to him is a picture that sits around. But Jack Carter learns that his interrogating people only makes the people he's trying to get in touch with grow farther from him.
But yet Jack does not stop his quest to prove that his brother did not die in an auto-accident. As he goes deeper into the world of filth under Seattle, Jack uncovers Cyrus Paice, a man who likes to project porn on the Internet for money.
As Jack comes closer to the truth, he realizes that if he'd have been there when they needed them, none of this would have ever gone down. Jack begins to get in touch with his niece, and eventually develops a new sense of family and honor.
I recommend this one for fans of PAYBACK, Stallone, Crime-dramas, or just somebody who likes good movies. This one is like the case of BATTLEFIELD EARTH.

I've not seen the Michael Caine original (yet) so I can't compare the two films. I thought that this one was okay, but I had some big problems with it. There's a lot of similarites between this movie and ""The Limey"" (if you've seen it you'll know) and that bugged me. It's like director Stepher Kay decided to remake THAT movie.
My main problem is that when everything's resolved there seems to be a scene missing (and it wasn't in the special feature deleted scenes) between Stallone and Miranda Richardson in which he explains why his brother (her husband) was killed and what for. Instead you get the ""seeya around"" scene between him and Rachael Leigh Cook.
Mickey Rourke is pretty good, but his demise is sort of....anti-climatic.
John C. McGingley is good (as always) and he gets his trademark swear word in ...
The subplot with Stallone's girlfriend back in Vegas just doesn't work. You wonder why it was even in there.

1271685,4,B00003CXO3,"Like Mel Gibson's Reworking of Lee Marvin's ""Point Black"", (""Payback"") Sylvester Stallone's ""Get Carter"" is an Enjoyable, yet Watered down Remake. Both Mel and Sly make Their characters Far more Likeable, and in Doing so, they Lose what made the Originals Classic films.
Sly's Carter is a Vegas Debt Collector who heads off to Seattle when his Brother Mysteriously dies. He meets a Lot of Sordid Characters on his little Holiday, including Miranda Richardson as Gloria Carter, Sly's Brothers Wife, Rachel Leigh Cook as Doreen Carter, Gloria's Daughter, the Wonderfully Smug Alan Cumming as Computer Genius Jeremy Kinnear, Michael Caine (whose presence only reminded me of the Superior Original) as the Shadowy Cliff Brumby, John C McGinley as Hometown Henchman Com McCarty, the Criminally Underrated Mickey Rourke as Cyrus Paice and the Stunning Rhona Mitra as Geraldine, Sly's Link to the Underground. They all give Restrained, Mature Performances that Perfectly Fit the Feel that the film is aiming for.
The Scenes where Stallone and Rourke face off are worth Purchase Price Alone, I simply Could Not Choose who I wanted to come out on Top. They are Two of my Favourite Tough Guys. Gretchen Mol makes a Good Impression in a very small part. (an Extended Cameo that has Good Performances from her and Sly, but it Worked Better in the Original) Her scenes, as well as Rachel Leigh Cook's scenes, nearly all feature Sly, and they are the films Best Scenes, Acting wise.
Action wise, the film is subdued. There are two well-staged Car chases that have been a little Over Edited, they still Achieve their Goal. Sly dishes out some Harsh Beatings, but the film never becomes a Full On Action film like Most of Sly's Resume. Fans of ""Copland"" should enjoy this, the two films share a lot in common, eg. Mood, Tone and Performances. In the End, the film is more of a Triumphant Return for Mickey Rourke than it is for Stallone... In my opinion, Stallone never left.",989193600,,1959,4.885885885885886

1271747,5,B00003CXO3,"It so happens that in the timeline of cinemas, the critics and viewers of movies walk into a theater with preconceived notions of what a film should be.  Directors are trivialized left and right--the good ones at least.  How else do we explain the lack of Academy Awards on Terrence Malick's belt after the Thin Red Line; people's degrading of John Woo movies as simply action, and not art; and, to pique my ire, the looking over of David Fincher in Fight Club?  Sure, Get Carter will never be a Gladiator or a Fight Club, something to inspire you and leave you disallusioned, but the directing is top-notch. If you enjoy angles and flashes, and the way these things can offer a greater insight into a character's development than simply the script, look no further than Stephen Kay.  At times, Carter is a gentler man.  In others we see violence through his eyes in flashes of anger.  Sure, the Die Hard's are great--they have the one-liners to make you laugh, and quote them when they're funny.  But there's nothing else there.  Characters do not evolve beyond introductions, and scripts offer no peace of mind.  I loved the Professional, even if it was a bit slow and thick at parts.  This movie excels where that one failed to coninue in excellence.  Carter is a truly interesting character, and Kay was smart enough to know that the movie should revolve around him--he is the subject and purpose of the movie.  And it works. Give this movie a chance--at 15.0$, how could you not?  If you like directing as an art, and as a corrolary to scripting, look here.  Don't look for action, though the car chases are the best since Ronin, or cheesy one-liners.  And I say, in summation, thank god for artful directing, finally.",988329600,,1723,4.64026402640264

I know the critics really bad-rapped it, probably in part because they were comparing it to the original. Well, I haven't seen the original, so I am judging the 2000 version on its own merit.  While I think some parts of the plot could have been more fully developed, overall, I enjoyed the visual style, the music and particularly the relationship between Stallone and Rachel Leigh Cook in the movie.  I enjoyed seeing Stallone's vulnerable side as he tries to make amends with his family and comes to terms with what happened to his brother and niece.  His pain over not being able to prevent either incident is tangible, and I was glad to see him kick some serious butt because of it.  I think he really was trying to help his niece realize that her painful experience and any other mistakes she made don't necessarily have to define who she will become.  Maybe he felt the mistakes he made had defined who he had become; but even he is able to overcome that somewhat, by opening his heart and loving his familly.

Considering I've only just seen the remake tonight,it's fair to  say it's going to be difficult to describe it as a film that stands on its own two feet. GET CARTER(1971) was about a mobster going back to Newcastle to find who murdered his brother. His search for the truth is ruthless. GET CARTER(2000) follows much the same story,Newcastle is now Seattle. I had my misgivings about Stallone playing Carter,but surprisingly he pulls it off. Not only does he look the part,this is one of his best roles. Supported by a sleazy Mickey Rourke,Miranda Richarson as his late brother's wife,and Rachael Leigh Cook who shines in this version,as her daughter Doreen. I wasn't expecting an action fest because the original gets by because of Micheal Caine's ruthless determination to get the truth. I do like this version but I have to deduct two stars for trying to sanitise Carter and adding a happy Hollywood ending. Also most of the film,the director is so obsessed with attention span,he ""strobes"" the picture regularly and unnecessarily. The final confrontation between Carter and Mickey Rourke is an anticlimax. The beach chase replaced by a brawll on a dancefloor. Not quite as memorable.  Stallone seems to better with age and here he still packs a punch.

1271752,3,B00003CXO3,"This is a mediocre remake of a 1971 film by the same name, with Sylvester Stallone inheriting the title role from Michael Caine (who also has a minor role in this film).  The screenplay has been updated to make it more techie (cyber porn, cell phones and internet billionaires).  Writer David McKenna (""American History X"") attempts to flesh out Carter a bit more and make him a nice guy in a bad profession.  Unfortunately, while that helps, the dialogue is uniformly bad and the characters are boringly stereotypical.
Director Stephen Kay is creative with the camera, but adds excessive style without regard to substance.  He throws every technique ever invented into the frame in a flurry of strange camera angles, strobe effects and fast forward photography.  The result is a presentation that is more idiosyncratic than brilliant.  There is so much hand held photography that by the end of the film, the viewer has whiplash from trying to follow the action.  Speaking of action, there is not much of it.  There is a lot of talk, a few fistfights and one decent car chase and that is about it.  For a film that clearly targets a male audience, this film fails to deliver what guys want most.
Stallone gives his standard tough guy performance, which is generally among the best in the business.  He is still in good shape at 54, but one has to wonder how much longer he can keep playing these characters before it becomes incongruous.  As has been the rule in remakes of late, the former Carter, Michael Caine is given a supporting role in this film.  Caine is excellent as the slime bag pulling the strings behind the scenes.  Rachel Leigh Cook also gives a fine performance as Carter's niece, and does an outstanding job in one poignant scene where she describes to her uncle how she was raped.  Alan Cumming plays a sniveling rich boy who made millions in technology and provides an almost comic contrast to Stallone's deadly seriousness.  Mickey Roarke provides his character with a sinister and despicable personality, and is still as tough as they come.  However, he is another actor whose thug days are numbered.
I rated this film a 5/10.  Despite some good acting, a dull script is embellished with unnecessary directorial flourishes making it more annoying than entertaining .  Women subtract at least two points for testosterone overload.",983491200,2,2351,4.835

The internet porn angle is kind of original I guess, and the scenes between Cook and Stallone are touching, but this film has some missing element that I can't put my finger on.

Though the look and sound is very stylish (the soundtrack is particularly interesting and original in a movie like this), sometimes the cuts and filmwork are rather jarring and draw too much attention to themselves. The entire movie almost looks like an MTV video, and yet it's hard to deny that all of this brings with it a definite atmosphere that works in spite of itself.
Even though Stallone stars in ""Get Carter,"" I would not call it an action flick as much as a thriller. The action scenes are brief and relatively scarce, yet still intense when they roll around in the later stages. This puts more focus on the plotline, which is very rarely ever a bad thing. Still, the plot can sometimes be hard to follow, and by the end of the movie there remain a great deal of loose ends that were never tied up. In fact, you'll wonder if the vast majority of the bad guys were killed or just wounded, which is mostly a result of the film's artistic lisence. Sylvester's character, however, makes a charming hero you want to follow to the end. He may once not have been such a great guy, but there is certainly a strong moral fiber embedded within him, espesially where his family is concerned.

In his quest he will come into contact with a host of shady characters, his brother's not-so innocent partner (Michael Caine), a computer mogul (Alan Cummings) with something to hide, and a seedy porn producer (Mickey Rourke).
Carter needs to get his brother's killer, before they ""Get Carter"".
""Get Carter"" is a much better action film than one might expect; it is beautifuly shot, with fast-action, and an intricate plot.
Stallone does his usual as the tough-guy Carter, and it works (with the exception of some cheesy line's ""My name is Carter, and YOU DON'T want to know me"" among others).  Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast as the hip, but seedy porn producer.  Miranda Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook, Alan Cummings, and Michael Caine all turn in great performances in their supporting roles.
""Get Carter"" is a good choice for a step-up from the norm in the action genre.

1271814,5,B00003CXO3,"""Get Carter"" is an excellent movie. It is unpredictable and nontraditional, and the bad guys get what they deserve. This movie has an excellent cast and they all did a great job acting. I don't know why this movis was overlooked at the theaters. My wife was one of those persons who overlooked it because she thought it might be too violent. I don't think it was too violent at all. Overall, this movie is fun to watch, and I will definitely buy it when it comes out on dvd. After telling my wife a little about the movie, she definitely wants to see it on dvd !",979344000,,562,4.212962962962963
