6999857,5,B00T3O7UDO,"A must have! I was quite looking for something like this, that explains to you with details which muscle are you working with certain bellydance moves... and Sadie explains it very well! I put a few moves in my Oriental Dance Fit Class and my students were delighted....",1425686400,12,270,4.645833333333333
6999858,5,B00T3O7UDO,This is a good work out & fun.,1462147200,,30,2.875
6999859,5,B00T3O7UDO,Sadie has a whole awesome workout for the bellydancer. I like it b/c she does lots of drills if you don't have time to do the whole two hour dvd. Its really good and I like her style and grace.,1447891200,,193,3.85
6999860,5,B00T3O7UDO,"Love this! Coming from an athletic background, it's very important for me to learn fundamentals and basics prior to tackling something new in order reach mastery. Sadie breaks everything down; from proper posture and alignment that prevent injury, to each little move that gets you the most out of your workout. Sadie is a wonderful teacher and this video not only gets results when it comes to exercise and fitness, but also it is fun and exciting to learn such a beautiful and sensual dance. It's fun! Try it!",1439251200,2,511,4.752808988764045
6999861,5,B00T3O7UDO,this is a great video I have really enjoyed it and Sadie is very good at explaining everything.  It is hard right now trying to get through the whole video.,1438819200,,156,4.2
6999862,5,B00T3O7UDO,"Performance: A drum solo, for some reason I was not really a fan of the performance piece, normally drum solos with tons of shimmying draw me in but this didn't do it, it was a bit boring.

As we all know. If there is any belly dancer that can get you in shape via DVD it  is going to be Sadie. As usual her breakdown of technique is good and you can see her moves clearly.

Each section has a technique then workout
The total DVD is 150 minutes long. 2 hours and 25 minutes worth of workout..Excellent
Opening statement ends
Warm-up:Plies and stretches for the most part.-Good stretches I would say make sure you are taking it at your comfort level.
Rhythmic hips: -this includes lot of ups/lifts and twist
Hip Drop, Don't Stop: Includes hip drops-hip circles and hip circle variations
Ripples: Includes pelvic lifts and pelvic lift shimmies-reverse undulation powered by the pelvic and lower abs
Fancy Footwork:some folkloric footwork mixed with some basic bd footwork
Hourglass:Included upper body sways/ chest and hip slides together/ one sided mayas
Dabke Sweat & Tone:
Shimmy Time:Included  choo choo shimmies and flat footed shimmies
Bonus Floorwork :
Cool Down:
  PRO'S
  Because the moves are 100% belly dance moves, you can master them and use them separately. You will be traveling and using footwork the entire DVD and there is layering throughout. I did not include/List all the footwork and arm variations throughout the sections but they are there.
  A good amount of the moves go fast-when you are in the workout section.  The Dabke sweat and tone..floored me, Its going to take some practice to get this section. User error though,Sadie's explanations were good.
  CONS
 The only thing I think the DVD truly needed was a separate header, where you could do the workout all the way through without the technique sections. Or if she had a chapter just for technique and one for the workout.  Secondly-as mentioned earlier-the moves can go fast especially in the workout section, you may have to drill a bit before moving on or else you'll get to the section and be at a lose, in which the DVD will not be effective-with multiple starts and stops.

Is this DVD a must have..No, for a fitness DVD it will not give you the body of say.. a DVD program like insanity.
For dancers it is not a  must have either,but I think this is a great DVD, if you want a fun workout  and enjoy belly dance, or you are a belly dancer and want a fun DVD to use without it being strictly about drills. I think this is actually a pretty good DVD for dancers wanting to get into ""dancing shape"" and acquiring the stamina that dance takes. You can never go wrong with  a Sadie DVD. It puts me in the mind of the belly dance workout series by WDNY just Sadie styled.. Except I like their format better though as you can go straight into the workout.
.
Do I think this DVD accomplishes what it says Yes as I believe it is geared toward dancers or those looking for dance forms of fitness and not  necessarily those looking for hardcore workouts.
For someone who wants a true hardcore workout: This DVD is not for you.

Side note:. I would really like a Pops,Locks and Shimmies 4 ..HINT..HINT",1433376000,20,3179,4.571428571428571
6999863,5,B00T3O7UDO,I love it. I could actually feel real results after trying it out. I would recommend this to friends. :),1431043200,4,104,4.25

6999865,4,B00T3O7UDO,"This is the 3rd top name belly dance instructor to give us her take on belly dance for fitness.  The grandmother of them all was Serena Wilson with her book The Serena Technique of Belly Dance, still available here on Amazon.  The 2nd was Rania Bossonis, whose first teacher was Serena, and her own book, Bellydancing for Fitness:  The Sexy Art that Tones Your Abs, Butt and Thighs (with cd) plus her numerous dvds, all available here on Amazon, all excellent quality.  And now Sadie has added her talent and experience to the mix with her version of belly dance for fitness.

The sections are as follows:
Warmup
Rhythmic Hips, cardio blast
Hip Drop Don't Stop, butt & arm shaper
Ripples, ab sculpt and back builder
Fancy Footwork, cardio, legs and glutes
Hourglass, waist trimmer and obliques
Dabke Sweat and Tone, legs, arms & cardio
Shimmy Time, cardio, legs & arms
Bonus Floorwork, upper body and ab crunch
Cooldown
Brief performance by Sadie

The dvd is very well organized, the instruction is excellent, really top notch.  A tutorial precedes each workout section.  Unfortunately, I was not able to skip the tutorial when choosing a section, so this made the dvd frustrating to use.  A matrix menu to choose  various sections and run the workout only part without the tutorial would have been appreciated -- such as what Ana and Ravi have for their kundalini yoga dvds.

Although Sadie's dancing is top quality as is her instruction, I must confess I don't think she is the best example of belly dance as a fitness system.  She states that belly dance is all she does for exercise.  To be honest, I would not want my ab section to look the way hers does, because the entire center of it from top to bottom sticks out in a very pronounced way, like a ridge.  It looks as if she needs to lose weight or have liposuction or a serious, extended regimen of Pilates.  I'm sorry, Sadie.  So that, plus the aggravation of not being able to play the workout sections and skip the tutorials is why I took off one star.",1427760000,7,2014,4.583798882681564
6999866,5,B00T3O7UDO,"Awesome. Sadie will kick your butt in to gear. This is a workout, but fun.",1427760000,6,74,4.0
6999867,5,B00T3O7UDO,"Been bellydancing for a while and also been exercising for a while.  Was getting bore and not getting results from most of my bellydance workouts that I already had, because most of the material out there is meant for the beginner.  Beginners can still get a good workout from this, but be prepared to only do a few sections at a time and to take the movements at maybe half the speed-  she moves really fast!!  There are tutorials for each section and Sadie breaks everything down well-  but you skip all these breakdowns!!  This is so nice because I can keep the burn going - i don't have to keep stopping my workout.  This workout will really hit your core-  all parts of your core but especially the obliques and lower abs.  I have done this workout twice now and already see greater range of motion in my undulations and they are more fluid as well.  I am also gaining more control and speed over my pelvic lifts and drops.  She also does a good job of keeping your heart rate up.  I was breathing pretty hard through out the whole thing-  The dabke section and shimmy section especially .  I really liked the dabke section too-  i dance in a troupe that does mainly darker fusion and it was so much fun to do the more energetic folk dancing!  You can choose to do the whole workout or just sections-  which is nice if you need to break down the workout over the week into more time friendly pcs.  This will work you legs and arms some-  i will probably continue to do my barre workouts for my legs and arms though .  Be careful of the warmup!  If you are already pretty flexible you will be ok, but some of these stretches will be really difficult for  a lot of people especially if you are doing this in the morning and your muscles are cold.  It would be quite easy to hurt yourself here- know your limits and modify as you need.  I would rather have seen more movement to get the heart pumping and light stretching in the beginning, and then deeper and longer stretches at the end when your muscles are fully warm-  but she does the brief stretching at the end.  What you won't get from this is a lot of fancy combinations-  this very much simple movements drilled to perfection with just enough variations to hit every muscle.  The goal is to gain strength , range of motion, flexibility and burn fat-  it is a workout that will also help your technique.  I can do this in the morning before my brain is fully awake - it is straight foward and uncomplicated.  This is not meant to teach you a bunch of combinations for your dance and it is not full dance choreos like World Dance (Neon) uses in their workouts.  The music is up beat and a lot like the music she has used in her other videos",1425859200,26,2700,4.274703557312253
8700159,4,B00T3O7UDO,"The instruction is excellent.  However, she consistently refers to the pelvis as the pelvic.  This drove me crazy until I told myself to get over it.  Her instruction is excellent and I like that it is modular so you don't have to do the whole DVD but just can do manageable sections.",1534723200,,284,4.423076923076923

8700165,5,B00T3O7UDO,I loved this dvd. You feel the work really.  The workout is all executed with arabic music and you feel you are really dancing besides the work is hard and repetitive like fitness. For the next dvd Sadie I would like you put more emphasis at the torso and arms to work with.  I recomend this dvd at all. And I am waiting for the next one.,1480464000,3,338,4.029850746268656

8700168,2,B00T3O7UDO,"I like it well enough as a training aid.  However I was really disappointed to learn that Sadie's ""belly dancer body"" on the DVD front cover was air-brushed.  It made the prospect of getting a figure like THAT unrealistic.  At first.  But practice ladies, practice.  You maybe pleasantly surprised.",1465257600,2,298,5.0
