Compare this to any current talk show and you'll see what I mean.  Truly, the fact that these are (finally) being made available on DVD is a godsend.",1229472000,5,264,4.26
3545936,1,B001E52UB2,"If you are interested in Buckley and Muggeridge and the question of faith, then this Firing Line interview will be immensely enlightening and enjoyable for you.  And you should try to find the transcript which I have found in some of Muggeridge's books.  Unfortunately, this DVD is an abridged version of the original one hour interview (which was presented after Firing Line was changed to a thirty minute format), and lasts for less than 30 minutes.  It in simply incomprehensible that the original 1 hour interview should be cut into pieces like this, and it is for this reason that I give it the one star.  The portion of the interview presented is great, but I certainly hope that future Firing Line DVDs have complete, not abridged programs.",1226880000,23,747,4.8125
3545937,5,B001E52UB2,"In 1980, as a young medical student, I happened to catch this interview, and was spellbound by these heavyweights discussing one of life's most vital subjects. In something I had never before done, nor since, I paid for a transcript, which has been one of most prized possessions. It is now ragged around the edges, but I still re-read parts, and have oft quoted it. I am going to order the DVD now, but just wanted a few of you know how powerful are the thoughts of Muggeridge, and encourage you to do the same. One day, when they get a bit older, I would like to share both the transcipt and interview with my 5 children.

3545938,5,B001E52UB2,"Bill Buckley and Malcolm Muggeridge at their finest,  presenting an erudite discussion on the search and finding of faith.  The two men clearly delight in the intellectual to-and-fro, and in each other's company.  Highly recommended.",1404086400,,233,5.6
3545939,5,B001E52UB2,"What a pleasure to listen to two intelligent, articulate men speak of that  which they both believe in with all their hearts.  Two giants of our time....both dead now.  We are the poorer for their demise.",1396224000,,204,4.611111111111111
3545940,5,B001E52UB2,A very worthwhile interview. I plan on listening to it again. Muggeridge provides a lot of insights on how he arrived at his faith.,1391212800,,131,4.5
3545941,5,B001E52UB2,"I thoroughly enjoyed the thoughtful conversation between Buckley and Muggeridge on ""How Does One Find Faith?""  This is the full sixty minute version as I had read that there is a condensed thirty minute version which left some viewers wanting more.  This is the version to buy.",1387497600,,277,4.872340425531915
3545942,5,B001E52UB2,"Go get 'em Bill.  He is the very definition or erudition.  I now own more than a dozen individual episodes and will, no doubt, purchase more.",1369872000,,141,4.384615384615385
3545943,5,B001E52UB2,"Muggeridge is engaging, as is Buckley.  An outstanding diaglogue between two brilliant men.  Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys intellectual exchange.",1368144000,2,159,6.181818181818182
3545944,5,B001E52UB2,"Listen through the whole interview.  Two very intelligent people discuss some of life's biggest issues: troubles, pain, joy, doubt and faith.",1366675200,,141,5.714285714285714
3545945,5,B001E52UB2,It is Buckley and Muggeridge. How could it be anything less than excellent? The interview explores how Muggeridge found the Christian faith and many more aspects of theology.,1364947200,,174,5.25
3545946,1,B001E52UB2,"Why did the Hoover Institute choose to release this 30 minute edited interview with Malcolm Muggeridge and the full 60 minute version? It seems as though they wanted to release all of the Firing Line episodes featuring Muggeridge (there are I believe 6 eps.).

This is a 30 minute edited discussion between Buckley and Muggeridge which initially aired in 1980 titled ""How Does One Find Faith?"" This version was released after Muggeridge's death and was reaired after Firing Line's format change from 60 to 30 minute long episodes. It opens with Buckley offering a brief eulogy and biography of Muggeridge before getting right to taped discussion hoping to offer as much as possible to the viewer.

The discussion still goes into depth and detail regarding Christianity and faith but if you only see this one, and are aware of a full version, you'd like to know what you missed.

I don't question why this ""Best of"" show was made in 1990, but I do question why the Hoover Inst. decided to release this AND the full version.

JUST GET THE FULL VERSION AT NO EXTRA COST. They're eight other episodes of Firing Line featuring Muggeridge. Get those, not this.",1364688000,3,1154,4.78391959798995
3545947,5,B001E52UB2,"Unlike most interviewers Buckley engages his guest, in this case Malcolm Muggeridge, through a socratic dialogue with critical understanding of the topic. There is a precision and probing of the subject that arouses your curiousity. This interview is an intellectual exploration of Christian faith, a faith to which Muggeridge came later in life. Muggeridge acknowledges his continuing doubt but explains that this is inherent his character and generally to profound belief. It was particularly inspiring to come upon the discussion of the central role that suffering plays in our spiritual growth.  My only disappointment was that this was a half hour version of the original one hour interview.  It left me wanting more and has been watched several times since I received the DVD. Charlie Rose is thin gruel in comparison.",1353196800,,824,5.282442748091603

8296490,5,B001E52UB2,"Most fundamentalist will disagree with Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge' theology and I could understand that. But as an agnostic person who has stumbled upon the writings of Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge, I have seen that he has found the Truth which could only be through Christ, and I am thankful for his incredible insight on how Christ can radically change a life by offering a dark world the everlasting gift of eternal life, liberty, freedom, and love. The discussions range from theology, to society, to culture, to Mr. Muggeridge's testimony, to William Blake and to Shakespeare, and so on. I like to occasionally watch this every now and then to continue to think and ponder about how faith works and it also informs me to share my faith with others who are also demanding answers to some of the most challenging questions that are confronting Christianity.",1459209600,,850,4.909722222222222
