8474753,1,B005IHVSFQ,"First of all I purchased this DVD because it had shasha on the cover doing what is supposed to be
a parody of snow white and the 7 dwarfs. Nope, no where in this collection will you find that movie.
So why do they paste it on the cover ? In hopes that you will buy it like I did. Save your money and
skip this collection. I am not finished here. There is more. The collection of the 6 movie you do get are
on a flimsy weak dvd format. What does that mean for you ? It means you can't really fast forward or rewind
without the picture getting stuck or frozen. Meanwhile the movies are ok I guess, it features a lot of mexican
talent and topless girls running around for no reason. Who doesnt like that ? I do but not at the price I paid for
this collection.",1356393600,,756,3.947712418300654
