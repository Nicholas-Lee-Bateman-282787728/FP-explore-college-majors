2750053,5,B000MV8R7A,"I'm a boomerang Catholic who finally came back home for good after studying the Catholic faith and the Bible using the Genesis to Jesus Bible Study from Scott Hahn and the Great Adventure Bible Timeline from Jeff Cavins. I've been teaching for 3 years, going from someone who couldn't tell you if David came before or after Abraham, to one who is considered ""the expert"" at my parish on the Bible  (that's a sad commentary, but common, and will only get better when other fledgling teachers take the plunge and offer Bible studies).  This past year (2010/11), I combined both Hahn's and Cavin's programs by myself because I sensed that both approaches (Covenant & Timeline) were ideal to get the best big picture. Like the horizontal and vertical beams on a cross intersect with Jesus, these two studies brought the Bible alive in my parish and many people are flocking to our study. Imagine my surprise and delight when I discovered and started watching ""Our Father's Plan"" on EWTN. Scott and Jeff were doing exactly what I had been trying to do - only MUCH better!!! Having this series as a resource that I can tap into any time will be invaluable to my continued personal growth in the faith and to keeping my teaching on track with the Catholic teachings.",1306713600,9,1259,4.6923076923076925

2750055,1,B000MV8R7A,"When I saw this request to write a review on this dvd, I couldn't believe it.  I can't write a review, mainly because i received audio tapes, I can't return them because i don't have the bill of sale.  I can't hear them, because I don't have a tape player. Sorry",1299715200,,262,4.117647058823529
2750056,5,B000MV8R7A,"Excellent bible study...taught by 2 former Protestant ministers who are now Catholic...it is the best of both worlds: scripture and tradition.  This is their first study so can be bought at a good price.  I hope to save up and buy Jeff Cavin's newest study: the Great Adventure.  I read everything Dr Hahn writes: recommend Rome, Sweet Home first if you are new to his writings.",1297036800,6,378,4.696969696969697
2750057,5,B000MV8R7A,"I read the Bible from cover to cover when I was about 12. And when I finished, I was nothin' but confused. Scott Hahn's audio Bible studies have changed that. In fact, his works played a large role in my conversion many years ago. The beauty of this series is the duo of Scott Hahn and Jeff Cavins. For part of each of the thirteen sessions, Jeff takes you through the Bible in chronological order, concentrating on 14 books of narrative history. Then Scott dives deeper into the theological meaning of the stories, drawing on the Catechism, the Early Fathers, and early Rabbinic literature, and present day scholarship, including his own.

Let these two wonderful Bible explorers lead you on a journey through salvation history you'll never forget. It'll change the way you think about the Bible. And it may even change the way you think about your faith. That faith might just come alive!

2750058,5,B000MV8R7A,"Hahn and Cavins do an amazing job in this brief series. They cover ""salvation history"" giving a superb overview of Biblical books, major characters and concepts. Their outline and explanations help any one who is passionate about the Bible reach a deeper understanding of the Big Picture so they can then read on their own, growing in the love of God, His book and His Son. I have watched this series several times, it's awesome.",1218672000,17,429,4.733333333333333
2750059,5,B000MV8R7A,"This is an excellent source for anyone interested in deepening their faith though understanding the Bible.  Conventional ""read these verses each day"" , though disciplined, don't give you a broader context to hold your interest and deeepen your understanding.  Great vehicle (one minor nit, you need to obtain a self-study tool from EWTN- could have been included)",1200614400,26,363,5.350877192982456

2750075,5,B000MV8R7A,"I simply would like to say , this bible series is terrific. I see some people complaining about not be able to follow it as a program, but really it is quite easy. It was a EWTN series that just took it's own life and became a great study for Parishes or home so  Scott Hahn and Jeff Cavins adapted it so we could enjoy as a bible study program.  The content is what really matters and as a timeline and a theological study, Scott and Jeff are hard to beat!
  What I really wanted to add to all of this and it is my opinion..this series that you could own for like 50 bucks with study guide and videos is far superior than the now popular Great Adventure Bible Timeline with Jeff Cavins alone. I have seen both and I have to say. much of the GABT is a ......well..just not as interesting as Our Father's plan.  I think any Catholic Bible Program is good for us..but OFP is the better choice. as a side note..to get the videos for the GABT it will cost you 400 dollars...that is a 4 with TWO  zeros as to ..OFP around 50 buck.  Enjoy either and welcome to the New Evangelization",1407369600,5,1077,4.124401913875598
2750076,5,B000MV8R7A,I used this each week of RCIA  After Easter the group wanted to stay on as an Evagelization team and make it available to the whole Parish. It turned out to be a tremendously understandable memorable presentation to a very large multiple age community,1404259200,,251,4.704545454545454
2750077,5,B000MV8R7A,"If you're looking for a good survey course on the bible look no further than this one. Dr. Scott Hahn is a gifted bible scholar and he does an excellent job in taking the complications of the bible and explaining them in an easy to understand way. I have personally experienced several bible teaching courses and they all fall short of the mark... but not this one. Dr. Hahn and Jeff Cavins are an excellent team is getting to the elemental basics of the bible without getting too simplistic. The essence of biblical covenant is brought forth in this bible teaching series. If you are a dispensational Christian than look elsewhere. But for the Christian who believes that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the God of Covenant through His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus, than this will explain that concept like no other bible study. Very highly recommended.",1400112000,2,866,4.703947368421052
2750078,1,B000MV8R7A,"The MOST user unfriendly thing that I have encountered! We could never figure out where we were supposed to be according to the time listed in the handbook. We also hated the infomercial format. We realize that this was originally on EWTN, but this should have been updated or cleaned up to make it better.
I would NOT recommend this to anyone. We ditched it after 7 lessons and went back to our Little Rock Studies series.",1386547200,3,423,4.5064935064935066

8172704,5,B000MV8R7A,"This is a no-frills Bible Study. The series was first shown on EWTN in the 1990s. So there are no bells and whistles used to keep the viewer engaged. Jeff Cavins and Scott Hahn stand at a podium and speak throughout the DVD. It is a very valuable resource for those who are more interested in content rather than presentation.
Jeff Cavins calls himself a water-skier, skimming over the surface of the Bible. Scott Hahn is called the deep sea diver, giving the theological perspective.

Jeff Cavins talks about the 12 time periods of salvation history and the 14 books from the Bible that are a must-read to get the historical perspective of salvation. These are the 14 books:
Genesis----Exodus----Numbers----Joshua----Judges----Ruth----1 Samuel---2 Samuel----1 Kings----2 Kings----1 Maccabees----Luke----Acts

Scott Hahn talks about the 6 covenants that God made with man:
1. Adam and Eve (Genesis 1:26  2:3)
2. Noah and his family (Genesis 9:8-17)
3. Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:1-3, 17:1-14, 22:16-18)
4. Moses and the Israelites (Exodus 19:5-6, 3:4-10, 6:7)
5. David and the Kingdom of Israel (2Samuel 7:8-19)
6. Jesus and the Church (Matthew 26:28, 16:17-19)

Here's the Series List I found online while researching the DVD:
1. Reading Through The Bible
You could open up the Bible and start reading; but do you know where to start? Scott Hahn and Jeff Cavins will deal with this throughout the series as they discuss how to read the Bible in chronological order while telling us what the Bible is saying. It is important to know its a book of history. You cant just open it up and start reading. It doesnt read like a novel. They will show how to read the Bible in Chronological order. Scott outlines four key theological concepts and foundation principals. They look at what we can do with it and how we can apply it. They also describe Biblical covenants and look at the six covenants that were made throughout the Bible.

2. History Of Early World
The first 11 chapters contain the main themes of the Bible. You can compare them to an acorn that sprouts a shoot and becomes a tree. They take a look at the first parts of Genesis 1-11. They say that genealogy acts like a camera lens. They also talk about the covenant that was made with Noah and how his sons spread throughout the land. Scott talks more in depth about the four themes and what they mean. He also describes the differences between a contract and a covenant.

3. Patriarchs
Scott and Jeff take a look at Gods blood covenant with Abraham which takes place in the second part of Genesis (12-50). They discuss how the three promises that God made to Abraham became covenants. They also talk about the patriarchs, what they represent and why blessings were important. They highlight the Bibles call to fidelity to Our Lord through Josephs bondage into slavery and his rise to power in Egypt.

4. Israel In Egypt
Scott and Jeff look at Abraham and the three promises and covenants that were made between him and God. They talk about the book of Exodus and explain difficult areas of the book. They talk about Israel as being Gods first-born son and discuss the covenant that was made at Mount Sini. They look at why cattle, sheep and goats were sacred for Egyptians. He also explains the breakaway from Egypt and the Mt. Sinai covenant. They then talk about the golden calf incident and the result from it and why the Levites were the ones who became priests.

5. Conquest Of Canaan
Scott and Jeff look at Israels forty year travail in the desert. They look at the books of Deuteronomy and Numbers. The book of Numbers describes the Israelites forty year wanderings. Scott and Jeff also cover the Deuteronomy covenant which established the political constitution for the nation of Israel from their time until the coming of Christ. It was to Israel what our Constitution is to us. They also explain why God required animal sacrifices.

6. Judges
Scott and Jeff examine the rise and fall of the nation of Israeli. They talk about the books of Joshua and Judges. They also talk about a five point cycle of sin that takes place seven times during this period. The cycle starts out by finding ourselves in sin until we are delivered by God and then we go back to silence. Every time during this cycle, God raised up leaders who were called Judges. There were 12 judges, 6 who were major judges and 6 who were minor ones. Scott talks about the three parts of Joshua and the battle of Jericho.

7. United Kingdom
Scott and Jeff take a look at Israels three major kings: Saul, David, and Solomon. The books of 1/2 Samuel and 1 Kings describe these kingdoms. The absence of a king represented a lack of holy leadership. Samuel warned the people of what a king would do and King Solomon ended up doing what Samuel said a king would do. They also look at how the second promise God made to Abraham was fulfilled in David. The kingdom lasted 120 years and was divided into 40 years for the three kings. This time is considered to be Israels Golden Age.

8. Divided Kingdom
Jeff and Scott examine the rebellion against King Solomons son around the year 930 BC in 1 and 2 Kings and how it divided Israel in two. They explain the importance of the prophets and knowing which part of Israel they are talking to. This sheds light on what they are saying and why. They also look at the story of Jonah and the prophets Daniel and Ezekiel.

9. The Exile
Scott and Jeff discuss the Babylonian exile and Israels return from exile. Judaism begins during their return. Israel endured 70 years in exile. Their return came about in 3 stages. Scott and Jeff examine the books of Ezra and Nehemiah who were among the first to return from exile. Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi wrote at this time as well. They conclude their discussion on the Old Testament by considering the Maccabbean revolt and the book of Maccabbees.

10. Gospels I
Scott and Jeff describe how to navigate the New Testament. They discuss the New Testaments structure, the Gospels main themes and intended audience and how they portrayed Christ. They also examine the similarities between Jesus and Moses.

11. Gospels II
Scott and Jeff examine St. Johns Gospel which is considered to be the most symbolic. It gives us a reliable history that is almost sacramental in character. They talk about the sacraments that are found in Johns Gospel: Baptism and the Eucharist. They also talk about why the Eucharist is really the Flesh of Christ and not a symbol and why for many years no one questioned it. It is in John 6:4 that Jesus links himself to the Passover and the Exodus. The Old Testament lamb is a symbol of Christ.

12. Acts I
Jeff and Scott introduce the early church. The Book of Acts is the last historical book. It fulfils the third promise to Abraham as Jesus commands His followers to spread the Gospel. They look at the Book Acts division in three parts which covers 29 years of the Churchs expansion. They also outline a theological approach to Acts and discuss Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura.

13. Acts II
Scott and Jeff conclude the series by examining the books of Hebrews and Revelations. Hebrews sheds light on how the New Covenant fulfills the Old Covenant. Jesus is the New Melchizedek. The doctrine of the Eucharist is the basis of the New Covenant. They also talk about how to understand the heart of the message of Revelation. Through the Mass, we will win the spiritual battle. They look at the Book of Revelations insights into the anti-Christ and the rapture and the image of Mary as the Ark of the New Covenant.",1499817600,5,7558,4.662912912912913
