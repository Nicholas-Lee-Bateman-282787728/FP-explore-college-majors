Spanky for the Little Rascals is in this but does not really feature in any important way. Don't buy this if you want to see a lot of Spanky,",1355529600,,305,4.135593220338983
8006901,5,B00015HX4U,"First see the star of this movie, Tommy Kelly, starring in the excellent film, ""Tom Sawyer-1938"". A charming actor. The ""1938-Tom Sawyer"" is in color.

The escapades of a boy and his friends while visiting the circus. Competition with a neighbor boy to win the annual foot-race. Humor. Charming.

This movie has Spanky from the ""Little Rascals"". If you liked the old ""Little Rascals - Our Gang"" series, or ""Leave it to Beaver"", or Mickey Rooney's ""Andy Hardy"" series, you should enjoy this 1938, black & white.",1157760000,4,510,4.850574712643678
8006902,4,B00015HX4U,"Here is chance to see a couple of actors, who were often seen together with Laurel and Hardy. Edgar Kennedy, who was called the master of the ""slow burn"" comedy, and Billy Gilbert best known from Laurel & Hardy's ""Music Box"", where he speaks with a german accent, as he does in ""Peck's Bad Boy With the Circus"".

For a hardcore Laurel & Hardy fans like myself, this movie is a must, because it shows some other sides of Kennedy and Gilbert.

As a bonus Spanky McFarland from the ""Our Gang"" comedies is participating.

All in all a funny a interesting movie",1152748800,4,556,4.431372549019608
8006903,3,B00015HX4U,"This is the third and final cinematic appearance of a character based upon a humourous series of newspaper tales written by George W. Peck in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Jackie Coogan and Jackie Cooper portrayed him in the first two films) with this Depression era RKO entry starring Tommy Kelly in an often silly but always briskly moving work offering, along with expected slapstick, some realistic dialogue, good direction from dependable Edward F. Cline, seamless ad libbing by beautiful Benita Hume, and other nice turns from William Demarest and Grant Mitchell.",1141171200,2,590,5.287234042553192
