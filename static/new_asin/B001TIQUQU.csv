8341634,1,B001TIQUQU,"this film is a 'spy-thriller' but if you like your humor non-existent and sex for no reason other than being Danish then you'll think this is crme de la crme.
the plot (?) is very 'convoluted' or, like the humor (see above) and it is just an overly long run-of-the-mill benny hill sketch.
it is worth it to 'see' the 'novel' use of 'resuscitation' (it involves 'nose').

if you don't speak or understand Danish there are subtitles that probably smooth out any 'subtleties' in the dialogue' anyways.",1475971200,,498,4.724137931034483
8341635,2,B001TIQUQU,"Another weak entry in the 'In The Sign Of' series, along with the other Agent 69 Jensen flick. These were the last in the series which had run its course, and was now on life-support, and the plug needed to be pulled. The farce was painful, the sex scenes fewer, the women less attractive, etc. You'll fast-forward through most of it, so why bother? Grab one of the earlier films, like 'In The Sign Of The Lion', 'Taurus', 'Gemini' or 'Virgin' for some enjoyable sex farces peppered with some hardcore action and fabulous looking Eurobabes...",1283644800,,542,4.71578947368421
8341636,2,B001TIQUQU,"This is the worst of these Danish Films sold on Amazon - it's a stupid 'Eurospy' farce that's downright painful to sit through, and this one lacks the sex, nudity and Eurobeauties that proliferate the other volumes in this series. Besides, this flick's from 1976, and the spy craze was well-over if you weren't milking the Bond franchise. Not being a big fan of dear, departed Benny Hill (RIP), I had my finger on the fast-forward button throughout the flick. Grab any of the others before this one - read my reviews for details.",1283644800,3,529,4.638297872340425
