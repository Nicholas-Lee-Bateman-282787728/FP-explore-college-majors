8245737,3,B0012F4QLQ,"It is hard to tell how much of the interview with agent George Piro was used or cut.  But the interview is no clear refutation of any of the central points about Saddam's WMD programs, his inventories of WMD at the time of the Iraq liberation, or his links and connections with Osama Bin Ladin and Al Qaeda, much less as a sponsor for international terrorism of all varieties.  The theme of the program reveals -- if you accept it on face value -- that Saddam was lying about WMD inventories, to bluff his enemies into treating Iraq with fearful respect.  However, having identified Saddam as a liar, the producers of the program (but not necessarily agent Piro, whose full interview is not shown) push the point that these revelations from Saddam (having now in captivity converted into a truth-teller) refute the claims of the Bush administration, on the reasons for going into Iraq.  This is specious reasoning, as he was known as a liar, thief, and mass-murdering dictator over a long period.  He had and used WMDs against the Kurds and Iranians, had all kinds of large inventories of precursor materials (uranium ores, insecticides) to make WMDs, was continuing the search to obtain more, and also had help from Chinese, North Korean and Russian military for his conventional weaponry and multi-stage rockets, for delivery of the same -- and boasted about all that publicly.

Thankfully, history will not be written by the ""hate Bush"" ideologues, but rather by those who take a more serious approach to documentation and fact-finding.  For that, I would recommend to visit the regimeofterror (com) website, or similar ones heavy on documentation and short on rhetoric, and search for ""Piro"", where one finds other materials from the FBI and other sources indicating Saddam was lying when he said he did not consider the USA to be his enemy, and therefore had no connections to Al Qaeda, or wish to attack the USA. The issues are myriad, to include reports by credible sources of the hijacking school frequented by Baluchi operatives for OBL at Salaman Pak in Iraq, the flight of at least one of the 1993 Twin Tower bombers to Iraq, where he was greeted with open arms and given safe haven from international arrest warrants, the transfer of Al Qaeda and Taliban personnel and light-weight WMD materials from Afghanistan into northern Iraq just after the early actions by American forces in Afghanistan, the observed movement of numerous 18-wheel freight trucks across the Syrian border prior to the campaign in Iraq, and many other questions that aren't going away merely because Saddam sang a Song of Innocence after his capture.  But in fact, he also confessed to having full intentions to reconstitute his WMD programs (all of them) when the opportunity presented itself, which was revealing.  How could he do that, unless the plans and capacities were somewhat already at hand?  Mr. Piro of the FBI struck me as a very ""nice fellow"" but clearly outmatched in his dual of words with one of the most hardened and clever political killers of the Middle East. One might expect Saddam to never admit to any WMD components actively available in 2003, firstly to avoid prosecutions in the USA for possible involvement in 911, and secondly if only to ""stick it to Bush"", knowing how the left-wing press was out to crucify Bush over that issue.

The interview is but one bit of evidence about Saddam.  Serious individuals will want to dig deeper. Still of value (but ever-denounced by the Saddam apologists) is the Hayes book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Connection-How-al-Qaeda-s-Collaboration-with-Saddam-Hussein-Has-Endangered-America/dp/B00073HH92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Connection : How al Qaeda's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America</a>, or the work by Mylorie, about the 1993 WTC bombing in which Iraqi connections were observed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-Against-America-Saddam-Hussein-and-the-World-Trade-Center-Attacks-A-Study-of-Revenge/dp/B000C4SNPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War Against America: Saddam Hussein and the World Trade Center Attacks: A Study of Revenge</a>.

None of that material has ever been refuted by critics, merely loudly denounced and ignored.  Other more suggestive evidence indicates quite a lot of Middle Eastern Islamic tyrants were ""in on the deal"" of the 911 attacks, just as over decades they have been cooperatively assaulting Israel and Jewish targets internationally.  I give it three stars only because the idea that Saddam could have been lying on that point, of the WMDs, is basically censored out of the discussion, as a possibility.  Scholars will want the Piro interview for their libraries, in any case.",1311206400,,5193,5.705958549222798
8245738,5,B0012F4QLQ,"I was surprised with this video. There were some very good questions asked by the reporter. I thought it was very insightful about Sadam. However, if you think it is Sadddam actually being interviewed, it is not. It is a FBI agent and he is wonderful. He had some good information and stories about Saddam and his captivity by the US. Well worth the time and money. Otis",1294099200,,370,4.455882352941177
