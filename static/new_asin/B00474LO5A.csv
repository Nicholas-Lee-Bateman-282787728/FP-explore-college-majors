Three solid routines.
Mixes in some pranayama which if you do yoga long enough you will want to explore at some point.
Just the right amount of intensity.
Good for intermediates and above or a beginner who wants to see what a developing a
personal practice could be like.",1431907200,,292,4.528301886792453
8417721,5,B00474LO5A,"I've been a yoga student for several years now, and I've been through my good share of yoga classes and yoga DVDs. I can say without hesitation that this DVD blows all the other DVDs out of the water.

Mas has crafted three absolutely beautiful practices. In a yoga class, it's difficult to balance between a good physical workout and a calming emotional experience. The balance can often tip one way or the other, leaving you at the end of your practice as either physically fulfilled but mentally frazzled from all the fast movements and lack of meditation, or blissed out but with very few challenges posed to your body. I feel these practices, however, are perfectly balanced between the two. The practice is difficult enough to get you sweating and feeling physically engaged, but calm enough to prevent you from getting frazzled. The addition of meditation and pranayama in these practices strengthens the mental/emotional experience of the class, which so few yoga DVDs seek to do.

Most importantly, the DVD has really gotten me excited about yoga, and I can't wait to do these practices again. This is a practice that you will WANT to do every week, rather than feel like you SHOULD be doing. I always feel enlivened after it. My day is just plain better when I practice with this DVD.",1322524800,4,1294,4.746666666666667
8417722,5,B00474LO5A,"purchased this yoga DVD set ""sight unseen.""  i've been looking for a good, solid DVD set for my personal practice.  Kundalini Yoga is my preferred style, but i needed something that was a bit more physical.  Mas Vidal accomplishes this (for me) in his sets while incorporating pranayama and meditation.  his instruction is concise, encouraging and challenging while offering variations for those of us that are less flexible.  it's nice to come across a DVD i can grow with.",1302480000,4,474,4.949367088607595
