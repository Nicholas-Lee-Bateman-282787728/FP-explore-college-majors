5022041,3,B006VY8CWW,"6 young adults charter a boat to a remote island. Alex (Leeanna Walsman) and her boyfriend Toobs (Simon Lyndon). Sam (Daisy Betts) comes along as a friend to Alex. Rob (Sam Lyndon), Archie (Harry Cook) and Bull (Ben Oxenbould) round out the surfers. The captain is Skipper Joe (Peter Phelps).

Sam shows a preference to Rob to the dismay and rage of Bull. Bull's inappropriate high testosterone conduct lands him a ""time out"" by himself on Gilligan's Island while the rest of the party remains on the boat. Bull plans and then takes his revenge as this turns into an abduction film. Ben Oxenbould plays the role of Bull very well. He could well be on his way to being the Australian ""David Hess"" of abduction terror. Outside of Bull's character, the film really doesn't take off.

8505242,1,B006VY8CWW,"I am sorry to say that this movie is awful, completely not interesting and not grabbing your attention. I rented it on Instant Video , I didn't even finish watching it that's how bad it is.
The actors keep mumbling throughout the whole movie, it is hard to understand what they are saying. One of the guys keeps getting mad and lose his temper, that's the whole movie. The only plus is that there are beautiful scenes of the ocean and waves, that's about it!  I don't recommend this movie !!",1380153600,,491,4.395604395604396
8505243,4,B006VY8CWW,"""Caught Inside"" (2010) is an Australian psychological thriller about a group of surfers who sail to a remote island paradise for vacation. A couple of women join the expedition at the last moment and they bring out the animal in one particular surfer and the holiday turns into a torturous adventure.

What I liked about this film, aside from the professional fimmaking and paradisical locations (Maldives), was the realism of the story and characters. The film skirts the borders of the slasher genre and I'm sure it was tempting for the writers to have the psycho (Ben Oxenbould) morph into Jason Vorhees, but they wisely resisted.

***SPOILER ALERT***

Someone complained on the IMDb message board about how unbelievable it was at one point when a group of four or five from the expedition ""cowardly"" put up with the psycho's tormenting antics when he doesn't even have a weapon. But this is where the film shines as a PSYCHOLOGICAL thriller and not just a thriller. Bull, the psycho, had gained the upper hand by this point in the story. The others are literally afraid of him and fearing for their lives. They're also in shock since this was supposed to be a paradise surfing vacation. The blond guy with short hair tried to scrap with Bull a couple of times and was easily humbled, not to mention beat up. It's a mental thing. Bull is the king of the mountain at this juncture -- ""king"" by brute force and arrogance alone. One of the girls, Sam, is anticipating getting raped and who knows what else. The teen dude doesn't know what to do, since he was Bull's little buddy, but now he sees what a total psycho he is. So they're all afraid and considering their options. No doubt they're thinking of ganging up on him, but they simply don't have it in them at this moment, so they endure his tormenting antics. They're also waiting for the right opportunity when their chances of success are best.

I didn't find this unbelievable at all; in fact, I found it very realistic.

***END SPOILER***

If you like films like the excellent ""Dead Calm"" (1989), be sure to check out ""Caught Inside."" It's not as good, but it comes respectfully close.

By the way, the Australian accents are thick so I recommend using the subtitles.

The film runs 93 minutes.

8505244,3,B006VY8CWW,"First off, you may need closed captioning to cut through the accents. I had no idea what some of the slang meant either. The overbutchering of fish may turn many off. The credits gleefully state that many fish were killed in it's making. When I read things like that, it has the same effect as a loud car or motorcycle going by my house ---obviously some guy overcompensating for an insecurity, real or imagined.

A group of surfers take off in a chartered boat. One's girlfriend is a filmmaker and she brings a friend along. A psycho surfer ""legend in his own mind"" snaps and mayhem ensues. Lesson from film - if you are out in the middle of nowhere and one of yours turns psycho, kill and run.

What a better movie it would have been, if it just concentrated on the surfing, but no one would be interested. Shame for that. Worth watching, but just.",1371686400,,850,4.407643312101911
8505245,2,B006VY8CWW,"Haven't seen the movie, didn't want to once I read the synopsis. Terror? Treachery? I read the book a long time ago and was really happy when I heard there was a movie called Caught Inside. The book is about the laidback attitude of surfers and their search for a perfect wave and becoming better people. Think Kerouac's Dharma Bums. But once I saw that Hollywood had decided to poison the plot I said no thanks.",1370390400,,412,4.434210526315789
8505246,4,B006VY8CWW,"It's a pretty good movie. Just the right amount of good looking people, fun surfing, beautiful scenery and suspense. The guy turns psycho and seals his own fate. I really liked the song at the end of the movie and am working to track that down and get a copy. I like how tough that bobby guy is, getting himself out of that situation!!",1346630400,,335,4.25
