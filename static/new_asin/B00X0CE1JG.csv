8714708,1,B00X0CE1JG,This is one of my favorite Korean movies. I've watched it over and over on my streaming service (Drama Fever). But the subtitles on this dvd are terrible. You will not know what is going on. They don't even make sense. Stream it. It's a great movie.,1525392000,,249,4.319148936170213
8714709,3,B00X0CE1JG,"Okay, so the packaging was ok and it came on time. The movie is excellent. BUT...what happened with the subs? They are there, but they don't make any sense. So, if its your first time watching the movie you probably won't understand most of it. 5 stars for the delivery and the movie itself; but the subs i give them 2 stars. So,  final rating 3 stars.",1478217600,,352,4.253731343283582
