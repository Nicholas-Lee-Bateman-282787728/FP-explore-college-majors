8484182,4,B005R8GOFU,"This film has never been released on DVD, so it is not DVD quality. It is likely that it has never been remastered, so you will see all the inherent flaws of the negative upon viewing. This is to be expected though from an old movie that was recorded from  damaged source material. All in all, it is serviceable, and likely the only way you'll be able to find a copy of this old film.",1366761600,,384,4.12
