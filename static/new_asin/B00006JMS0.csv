1781404,4,B00006JMS0,"""Jungle Jim"" is a 12-chapter Universal serial, released in January of 1937, based on the Alex Raymond comic strip.  It was directed by Ford Beebe and Cliff Smith.

Somewhere in Africa, an attorney, Tyler (Selmar Jackson) arrives looking into the possibility that Joan Redmond, a missing heiress, might still be alive.  There are rumors of a white girl, worshiped by a native tribe as a ""lion goddess"" not far from where the ship she and her parents were on sank, a little over 15 years earlier.  But the attorney warns that a man claiming to be a distant relative, Bruce Redmond (Bryant Washburn) who would inherit the fortune if Joan dies, might also be on her trail, and would stop at nothing to get his hands on the money.  Jungle Jim (Grant Withers) has other obligations, but suggests that his friend, Red Hallihan (Frank McGlynn, Jr.) could lead the expedition.  Unfortunately, Bruce Redmond has already enlisted Slade and LaBat (Al Bridge and Paul Sutton) for his search.  LaBat murders Red and the attorney, attempting to cover the crime by turning some captured animals loose.  Jungle Jim and his pal, Malay Mike (Raymond Hatton) go after the villains, eventually encountering Joan (Betty Jane Rhodes) whose influence with the natives is being used by a white man known as The Cobra (Henry Brandon) to maintain his rule of the tribe, claiming he is Joan's father.  The Cobra and his sister, Shanghai Lil (Evelyn Brent) are fugitives from justice, and to prevent the authorities from learning their whereabouts, they have any white intruders killed.

There are plenty of jungle perils, stock footage and otherwise including lions, leopards, elephants, crocodiles and tigers -- and here the tigers are noted as being out of place, presumably having also made it to shore from the same ship Joan was on.  There are also savage native tribes, in addition to the two sets of bad guys.  But while the plot doesn't really support twelve chapters very well, with the action mostly restricted to our heroes being alternately captured and escaping, at least Betty Jane Rhodes in her jungle outfit is more interesting as an object of pursuit by the factions than the money itself would have been.  As The Cobra, Henry Brandon's underplayed style works as a portrayal of a criminal trying to keep a low profile, but is less successful as a leader.  More bravado would have helped the scene where he steps out on a balcony to convince the natives he controls a suddenly-active volcano.  His palace is quite impressive but he is given little to do, and his sister mostly whines about how the authorities might find them.  Evelyn Brent had a better role in ""Holt of the Secret Service.""  The ""lesser"" bad guys, Al Bridge and especially Paul Sutton as LaBat are far more menacing.  Grant Withers does well enough in the title role, but Raymond Hatton turns in the best performance, whether providing ""comic relief,"" strong support, or both.

In addition to a somewhat redundant plot, Universal would have us think that Jungle Jim sings.  He is heard in the distance before his arrival, and in the third chapter appears entertaining some natives, who apparently have an orchestra, singing the same song, ""I'm Takin' the Jungle Trail"" by Kay Kellogg, though the view of Grant Withers is mostly kept at a distance, and no further such incidents afflict the remaining chapters.  The tune is used without the singing during the chapter introductions.  A few months earlier Universal had far more success with John (""Dusty"") King singing his way through the 13-chapter serial ""Ace Drummond,"" also with a Kellogg number, ""Give Me a Ship and a Song.""

VCI's edition on DVD, #8340 is spread out on two discs.  It is advertised as being ""from a fine-grain 35mm"" print, and the image is splendid, sharp and with fine gray scale.  My TV showed a slight bend at the very top of the screen, apparently due to the copy-protection scheme used, but it was not normally noticed.  The sound isn't too good during the opening credits, having more than a little distortion, but it cleans up during the chapters.  The opening credits are not all from the chapters they introduce; while the MPPDA certificate numbers are not all the same, there are only seven of them, though this may be partially due to the film print.  The copyright date on these is 1936 for the first six chapters, and 1937 for the rest.  The titles are the originals from Universal, not from a later issue, and as was done at the time, those for the first three chapters have individual pictures of the main cast, the rest just list the actors.  The chapters are introduced by ""comic strip"" panels, as was done for ""Ace Drummond,"" ""Secret Agent X-9,"" ""Radio Patrol"" and the second Flash Gordon serial, among others.  ""Extras"" include ""Bios"" of Grant Withers, Betty Jane Rhodes, Raymond Hatton and Ford I. Beebe.  There is a ""Photo Gallery"" with about 25 pictures, and trailers for seven serials though the one for ""Jungle Jim"" is not among them.

So we have a fine print, good disc layout, and a serial that is good, but not great.  Still a commendable release from VCI, and enjoyable, especially if watched with a day or more between chapters.",1313107200,,5186,4.802927927927928

1781406,3,B00006JMS0,"An above-average serial with plenty of action, outstanding stunt work, and interesting intros to each chapter via vintage cartoon panels in the style of creator Alex Raymond.  One disappointing note: having greatly enjoyed Henry Brandon in a star villian turn as Fu Manchu[ASIN:B000087F3F Drums of Fu Manchu], it was sad here to see him underutilized as a secondary (mostly offscreen) baddie.  His natural and realistic acting was ahead of its time (thus accounting for his long career) and puts the other, stilted cast members to shame(save the always great Rondo Hatten).  Still, this one is well worth a look.",1226620800,4,612,5.161616161616162

1781408,4,B00006JMS0,"""Jungle Jim"" is worth the price. The quality of this DVD is quite good for a cliffhanger from 1936. VCI Entertainment did a fine job.
I'm not completely agree with the other viewers. I found this chapterplay a little bit slow paced and sometimes too talky. Grant Withers is a nice Jungle Jim, Raymond Hatton adds some pleasant jokes, but Betty Jane Rhodes isn't very convincing as Joan the Lion Goddess. Henry Brandon is perfect as the Cobra, also Evelyn Brent as Shanghai Lil. Brandon is really an underrated actor. I specially think about his part as the indian chief Scar in the ""Searchers"" directed by John Ford. I haven't seen him yet in ""Drums of Fu Manchu"", but I'm sure he must be great. I hope someday there will be a book about all the villains in serials !
So what else can be said about ""Jungle Jim"" ? It's an honest entertainment, but it could have been better. I found it sometimes a little bit superficial. Perhaps the directors Ford Beebe and Cliff Smith didn't have the same sense of action like William Witney & John English. However if you like jungle adventures, you will enjoy these 12 chapters.",1082246400,12,1116,4.557213930348259
1781409,5,B00006JMS0,"Agree with reviewer form Holland; except I want to give 5 stars.  The reason for 5 stars is that I consider what can be accomplished with ""B"" film budgeted dollars, then this film reaches the apex of what can be accomplished.  Character, setting, and dialogue are all marvelously rendered. Sure, we do not have the Stanislavsky school of acting here, but could even Montgomery Clift or Brando focus on internalizing the character while being asked to dive off cliffs or stand next to live, dangerous lions and tigers? I think not! Therefore, five awesome stars. Jungle Jim is a real entertainer.",1057968000,15,595,4.881188118811881
1781410,5,B00006JMS0,"Universal isn't generally considered highly for the quality of their serials, but I am noticing that those based on popular comic strips appear generally to be good adaptations.  I didn't like ACE DRUMMOND, but the first & third FLASH GORDONs, THE ADVENTURES OF SMILIN' JACK, BUCK ROGERS, and JUNGLE JIM are all worthwhile chapterplays.
Grant Withers is quite good in the title role as is Raymond Hatton as his light-hearted but not obnoxiously comic sidekick, Malay Mike.  The female lead is a strong actress in a strong role, no weeping willow who needs to be constantly rescued.  Henry Brandon as the Cobra and Evelyn Brent as Shanghai Lil are suitably menacing villians.
A lot of stock wild animal footage enhances the total product.  And while the Cobra's stronghold isn't quite as sumptuous as Emporer Ming's, it'll definitely do.
There aren't a lot of spectacular stunts nor are there any extraordinarily spectacular and imaginative chapter endings.  But the pacing is good with hardly a dull moment, and the chapter endings are mostly well done.
The plot with two sets of villians and the standard missing heiress who's been raised by wild animals is complicated enough to sustain the 13 chapters.
So if you enjoy jungle serials, you should like this one.",1041292800,2,1263,4.995238095238095
1781431,4,B00006JMS0,"JUNGLE JIM: This 12-chapter serial from Universal in 1937 starred Grant Withers as Jungle Jim, with Raymond Hatton as his sidekick, Malay Mike, and Betty Jane Rhodes as the white Lion Goddess, Joan. Jungle Jim has been asked to find the white Lion Goddess who is thought to be a the missing child from a shipwreck, and the heiress to a family fortune. However, her evil uncle wants the fortune and hires men to kill her, so he will inherit the fortune. To add to the mix, The Cobra and his sister Shanghai Lil rule the local natives, and Joan thinks they are her parents, not knowing the pair are wanted in England for murder. There were some nice animal clips from other films. Most of the action takes place around a rocky landscape with a cave, and some jungle scenery. The cliffhangers were pretty good, but Joan doesnt work well for the girl raised by lions. Too educated in her speech. In fact, some of the natives were pretty highly educated too, I think. My real problem was watching all those Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan and Jungle Jim movies growing up. Grant Withers just didn't match up to Weissmuller. And the only sidekick Weissmuller needed was a monkey. Overall, it just wasn't the quality of Republic Serials, nor the Jungle Jim I grew up with.",1465171200,,1259,4.6

I watch a few at a time on Saturday mornings, reminding me how my parents probably got to see them. It's obvious that this influenced Spielberg to make the Indiana Jones films, and while they test believability, they are fast and fun, a great way to spend a rainy day. The best thing about this collection is how compact it is for all films, and easy to store and save room. I keep all the Ones Media films together I've purchased, so if I want to break out a fun old B movie, I don't have to go digging for it like I would had I purchased these titles individually.",1493164800,3,678,4.143939393939394
