4897696,1,B005VU53SS,I thought this was one of the old Charlie Chan movies so I was disappointed when I started the movie and wasn't sure what I was looking at. Stopped it just couldn't watch it.,1365292800,,174,4.147058823529412
4897697,1,B005VU53SS,"Not sure why Amazon would put that for sale...it's rediculous.  The actors can't speak a sentence, and the slapstick is tragic, if not imbecile.  Will try to get my my money back.",1362873600,,179,4.5625
4897698,1,B005VU53SS,I cannot figure out why Amazon would charge its customers for this movie.  It was horrible and I turned it off in minutes.  Some Quality Control Employee needs to watch and reevalute this movie.  Do not and I repeat do not waste your time or money on this movie.  As the one star indicated I hated it.,1359417600,5,301,4.228070175438597
4897699,1,B005VU53SS,"The best part was the opening and closing credits. Lines are stumbled but left in with clumsy edits or no edits at all.
I am mystified by the ending!",1346198400,2,149,4.172413793103448
4897700,1,B005VU53SS,This was Awful!.  I thought it was a original Charlie Chan movie.  This was a poorly executed spoof!  I was very dissapointed.  Do not waste your time ordering this movie.,1344902400,6,171,4.6
4897701,1,B005VU53SS,"The script, acting and cinematography are very amateurish in this indie film. Poor screenwriting has abrupt scene cuts and no set-up dialogue. The camera often focuses on only one actor in a scene. The music runs continually n the background and the actors mics have echo in them. Scenes are often overlit, and appear to be one-takes from the stumbled lines. How can you focus on an actor with no lines when the other actor has all the dialog? The story takes lace in 1945 but many of the sets are shot in buildings that are obviously of much later construction. Don't waste your money on this home video.",1341446400,7,605,4.559633027522936
4897702,1,B005VU53SS,I did not enjoy this movie in the least.  I was expecting something at least halfway decent since I love the Charlie Chan movies and I was highly dissappointed.  I am glad I only rented this.,1331683200,10,191,4.277777777777778
4897703,1,B005VU53SS,Awful!  Thought it was a Charlie Chan movie - NOT.  Felt it was a scam as summary fooled me.,1445472000,,92,3.789473684210526
4897704,1,B005VU53SS,just a bad movie.,1442361600,,17,3.5
4897705,1,B005VU53SS,This should have zero stars. It isn't a real Charlie Chan movie. I would not advise renting it.,1440806400,,95,4.333333333333333
4897706,1,B005VU53SS,I thought it was some lost Charlie Chan spinoff. Its from 2011. The worst movie script/ Acting ever. Ed Wood could teach them about storylines and camera skills.,1430265600,,161,4.785714285714286
4897707,1,B005VU53SS,This was just plain BAD...my children have made better movies with five minutes of prep and a cell phone camera.  Please don't waste time or money on this.,1421884800,,155,4.535714285714286
4897708,1,B005VU53SS,"This is the worst ""movie"" I have ever seen in my entire life! Amazon should be ashamed of itself to offer it at all. I love Charlie Chan and Detective Wong, and this product only gets selected by people who think it's something that it's not. This is patently deceptive.",1418428800,,270,4.42
4897709,1,B005VU53SS,"worst movie I have ever seen, I never watched the end... waste of my money",1417910400,,74,4.0
4897710,1,B005VU53SS,"Not what I believed it would be and I only watched enough to know I never should have spent the money for the rental.
Sorry, but I honestly cannot recommend this.",1416700800,,162,4.258064516129032
4897711,1,B005VU53SS,Worst thing I've ever watched,1415836800,,29,5.0
4897712,2,B005VU53SS,Ok,1415836800,,2,2.0
4897713,1,B005VU53SS,This is an poorly done enactment of a historical event with really bad actors.  I bsrely made it through 15 minutes.  I do not recommend this.  I only gave it one star in order to complete the survey.,1410307200,,200,4.2105263157894735
4897714,1,B005VU53SS,"I looked at this listing with a grain of salt. I have seen a few movies I like with 1star listings, so I debated that perhaps the 1 star was a mistake. WRONG! The 1 star is absolutely correct, only because we are not allowed to use no stars. This is a ridiculous farce. It is a Charlie Chan movie only in some writer's imagination. Bottom line: don't be fooled!",1401667200,,361,4.171428571428572
4897715,1,B005VU53SS,that was the worse acting; it looked like a high school productiion -  awful awful awful  what a waste of my time!,1401062400,,114,4.136363636363637
4897716,1,B005VU53SS,"This is NOT a movie!!! It is someone's home video. It was obviously done in their living room...with a home video camera! How does this happen? Did someone send in their home video to Amazon and say, it's an Indy film? If so, I'm getting my vacation footage from my trip to Montana and sending it to Amazon. Here's my advice...take $2.00 out of your wallet and throw it in the trash, you would be better served than watching this stupidity. Can I give it negative stars? I am demanding my money back. It's only $2.00 but somebody needs to get this off the site. Maybe if more people ask for cash back, they'll get the message.",1393891200,,626,4.358974358974359
4897717,1,B005VU53SS,"Don't! This is awful amateur crap with no redeeming qualities. A cast of wooden and inept amateurs put this together. The video looks as though it were shot with a cellphone. It is irresponsible of Amazon to offer this piece of crap, much less to take money for it. Who do I call to complain?",1380412800,3,292,4.327272727272727
4897718,1,B005VU53SS,"I watched less than five minutes; it was simply TERRIBLE ! ""Mantan Moreland"" was not the actor beloved in Charlie Chan movies, nor were the other actors ""portraying "" Charlie and his son. Indeed they were complete unknowns ""acting"" ( and I use the term VERY loosely) in a terrible travesty of a movie. I gave it one star only because I could not give it less. DO NOT rent this",1379548800,3,376,4.309859154929577
4897719,1,B005VU53SS,"I thought this was a Charlie Chan movie but after renting it I found out that this was a cheaply made parity of a Charlie Chan movie. The characters were racial stereotypes, the script was poorly written and the acting was corny. This was a waste of money even if it was only $1.99",1378944000,4,281,4.222222222222222
4897720,1,B005VU53SS,"If I could, I'd rate this lower, but 1 star is the best I can do. It is not worth the $1.99 rental cost. How Amazon can charge a rental for this movie is beyond me. I'd demand a refund, but it isn't worth the trouble. The plot description is totally misleading. It gives you the impression that the original actors (Moreland and Chan) are the in the movie. Instead you get 2 very poor imitations who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. As-a-matter-of-fact, all the so-called actors perform like they're still in acting school. Reminds me of the SCI/FI channel. It doesn't even qualify as ""camp"".  My advice, pass on this one, especially if you're a Chan fan.",1370044800,2,665,4.450819672131147
4897721,1,B005VU53SS,did not like this movie it was boring I couldn't even watch the whole thing---boring!!  I was not for me,1367798400,,104,4.2
4897722,1,B005VU53SS,"Ugh!  How absolutely dreadful!  I don't know why this was even done--what a waste.  The setting was obviously backroom, there was no redeeming quality to this film-but, then, I didn't watch much of it.  I have better things to do with my time--like cleaning public toilets!  Ugh.",1366156800,,279,4.851063829787234
8487608,1,B005VU53SS,Not what I expected.,1480636800,,20,4.25
8487609,1,B005VU53SS,"I am a big Charlie Chan fan. I have all the movies, the TV series, and the radio shows.
I am always looking for something ""Chan"" that I have not seen. I wish I had not seen this. I rented this and could only stand it for 6 excruciating minutes. Every thing about it is terrible.  Believe the reviews. Do not let your curiosity cloud your judgement. Stay away! Please! My brain is burning....",1476662400,,391,4.283783783783784
8487610,1,B005VU53SS,Very poorly done. The director is poor at best. The actors were pathetic.,1466035200,,73,4.6923076923076925
8487611,1,B005VU53SS,"Worst ""movie"" ever!  Don't download it!  Very poor video camera quality shot by an amateur with actors who must be friends of the filmmaker.  Terrible waste of money. Amazon Prime video should remove this from their list!",1461369600,,221,4.918918918918919
8487612,1,B005VU53SS,I did other things while this was on--that's how boring it was. I did watch the end when the murderer was to be exposed but you couldn't even see who it was! No wonder the writer was anonymous.  Did someone involved with this so called movie know someone at Amazon to sell and rent it? I can't believe this was ever shown at theaters.,1459728000,,334,4.21875
8487613,1,B005VU53SS,"Badly written, badly acted, a just plain bad movie.  Happily I only rented and not bought.
And I so love the Charlie Chan films,
I was so looking forward to the new twist of a film about a film being filmed while a ' real'  murder is being investigated
I will never know as it was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it
.",1456099200,,324,3.9692307692307693
8487614,1,B005VU53SS,Oh my godsome guy with a video camera got a bunch of non-actor friends together and filmed this mess over a 3 day weekend. No one knows there lines or cues or blocking. I am NOT kidding! I've seen middle school kids put together better video productions. Do NOT buy this dreck.,1455753600,,277,4.346153846153846
8487615,1,B005VU53SS,"If I could give this turkey a minus star I would award it MINUS 5. What a piece of trash. Horrid production values. Bad acting. Horrid script. This was a waste of $2...

Please Amazon, offer clips at no cost for movies so we consumers can evaluate a movie before we rent or buy!

""Charlie Chan"" is rolling over in his grave...",1454371200,,326,4.241935483870968
8487616,1,B005VU53SS,This is a truly awful amateur effort.,1453420800,,37,4.428571428571429
8487617,1,B005VU53SS,It was so cheesey/bad i quit watching this amateurish piece of bad acting awkward dialogue after 5 min. Wish i coukd get my money back. It was awful. I give it minus 10 stars. Gawdawful!! Don't waste yourmoney on this piece of junk. Its a trap to get your miney!!,1452038400,,263,4.28
