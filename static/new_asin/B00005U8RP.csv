7954475,5,B00005U8RP,"This movie has captured the attention of our almost 2 year old daughter!  The boy, Little Bill, is sweet, kind and very much a typical 5 year old.  I enjoy how the movie has action, yet does not go so fast that I have to explain everything to my daughter.  She can understand the dialogue and enjoys every bit of it.  Little Bill is great!",1132963200,,339,4.1692307692307695
7954476,5,B00005U8RP,"I can't imagine what the other ""reviewers"" have been watching. This video-length compilation from the Nick Jr. show is outstanding in its simple storytelling of the wonder and magic of childhood. Little Bill (voiced by Xavier Pritchard) is an engaging little tyke with an infectiously genuine giggle. His pet hamster, Elephant, is his confident and privy to the boy's whimsical ""flights of fantasy"". The boy's vivid imagination helps to promote the like in the show's young audience.
Bill's efforts to find a solution to his ""wabbit"" problem are certainly not boring and the story is perfect for the young set.
In a world where violent, action-ridden animation seems to be the rule, it is gratifying to find a series that uses simplicity to deliver its message.
My niece and nephew are big fans of Little Bill and so is their uncle!",1072137600,5,832,4.907801418439717
7954477,4,B00005U8RP,"There's nothing I remember more about grammar school than the great field trips we took to the zoo!  Little Bill and his classmates go on their own field trip, and in the process the little guy learns about patience.  Then he gets a pet, which begins the process of teaching responsibility.  His class then learns about concern for others (in this case, animals) by finding a home for the class pets.
I saw each of these episodes on television, and was extremely excited to see that they were available to buy!  They are fun, interesting, and are all in all great additions to the collection of Little Bill tapes, toys and books that I own.  The lessons my daughter will learn from these stories will be invaluable.",1068595200,3,715,4.5984251968503935
