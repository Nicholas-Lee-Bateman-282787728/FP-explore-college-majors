8238107,5,B0010OIP3E,This movie was purchased as a gift for my Father-In-Law. It was a favorite of his and he was suprised that we found it! It was well shipped and arrived quickly. The price was good and we are happy customers.,1246060800,,207,4.2
8238108,4,B0010OIP3E,"I am glad that the seller emphasized that this was a 3D version as other sellers did not, and I would have been disappointed if I just got the 2D. The only problem was not the fault of the seller but the postal service in delaying receipt of the movie.",1234915200,,252,4.06
8238109,4,B0010OIP3E,A good family movie that shows imagination and sciecne fiction. This is a timeless tale that gives it's own twist on the original story but still keeps the suspense to it. There is some violence but no detail in the violence (no blood or gore). I would recommend it for anyone that likes timeless tales.,1225152000,8,303,4.527272727272727
