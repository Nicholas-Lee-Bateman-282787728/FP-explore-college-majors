8284617,3,B001BSBBXU,"Every diver takes that time to sit around the shop and swap stories.  This DVD is just that, without the shop and without your turn to share.

The stories are very brief to a bit more than necessary in detail.  Some are purely egocentric and some are the very thing which makes us love our hydo-addiction.  I have watched it twice and it will probably sit on my shelf from now on.  I think one place some of these stories would be useful is at a dive shop when people are curious about the sport, for a personal purchase, a night out with fellow divers is more useful.

I did not buy it at full price but purchased a used copy.  It was worth the used price but it is very pricey for a short DVD with limited production quality.",1275609600,,727,4.15
