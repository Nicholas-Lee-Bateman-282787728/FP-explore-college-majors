8050299,1,B0007P9JGO,"I bought this dvd hoping to get some good advice on poker. The people who made this dvd and charged people for it should be ashamed. This dvd is nothing more than howard giving speeches on his life and the rest is nonsense. I got no information at all. This video is just an advertisment for going to his $4,000 fantasy camp.",1145923200,2,325,4.258064516129032
8050300,2,B0007P9JGO,"Both of the other reviews do a good job in telling you why not to but this DVD... the producers of these DVDs have actually edited out all of the actual ""Camp"" lectures and classes and left you with only a very basic overview of what the camp was to offer the participants. If you know that the ""Reality Camp"" cost over $3000 and bought the DVD's hoping to get some of the classes on DVD from the camp, there really aren't any. The talk Howard gives on how he developed as a player from being nearly homeless in New York to playing in some of the biggest games in Las Vegas with Doyle Brunson and Chip Reese is probably the redeeming value in this set but just be aware the classes have been edited out so you get close to no poker instruction.",1131840000,4,744,4.173611111111111
8050301,2,B0007P9JGO,"I am a fan of the ""Secrets of hold'em"" series and I enjoy listening to Howard Lederer. This dvd basically chops out any meaningful information. Chris Ferguson literally begins a speech on post flop play and it moves to another segment in mid sentence.

First dvd is basically all Howard and he is not giving any meaningful information. Ironically, he talks about all the people that have taught him along the way and how much of an honor it was for him to teach other people. All of that information was cut from these dvds. He talks about his path to becoming a professional and his poker philosophy. Not bad to listen to, but I don't think that's what people would be looking for in a poker camp DVD.

Second dvd is award ceremony to camp winners. Worthless speakers like the owner of a bookstore, Howard's dad (who talks forever), and a tournament director talk about stuff that will never help your game. Phil Gordon takes the stage and offers not one bit of advice. Ferguson talks for less than five minutes on early internet poker. Annie Duke was good, but short (less than 5 minutes). Gus Hansen made an appearance, but answered only one question about his playing style.

All of the speeches concerning poker strategy were deliberately cut out. Considering the price, I am sure people felt they are getting two DVDs of the same knowledge the poker campers were getting. This is not the case. You get opening banquet speeches, closing ceremonies. Some footage of the celebrity pro-am, where they were able to add names like Seidel, Andy Bloch, etc who never spoke on the dvd.

I'm not totally upset over the DVDs because I enjoyed some of the speeches, although none were on poker techniques or strategy. This was the reason for 2 stars (probably should be 1 1/2, but if all this sounds like fun viewing to you, it might be something to get for entertainment). If you expect poker instruction from names like Annie Duke, Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, Phil Gordon, etc....you won't get it here and will be terribly disappointed.",1130198400,4,2036,4.69467787114846
8050302,1,B0007P9JGO,"While Howard's ""Secrets of"" videos are probably the best DVD learning tools available today, this 2 DVD set is worthless.  The video is basically chopped up pieces of lectures given at his September 2004 Poker Fantasy Camp. The limited amount of information given is marginally valuable at best.  My guess is that this video was promised to the people who attended.  I would suggest this video is not a great advertisement for future participation.",1125792000,4,448,5.027027027027027
