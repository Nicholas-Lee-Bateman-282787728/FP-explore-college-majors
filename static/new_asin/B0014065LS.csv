This film had me laughing and thinking for months afterward. The 4 members of the Franklin family are played perfectly by the actors.

3120976,4,B0014065LS,"Since my daughter, Mari Blackwell, is the star of this effort and her SO, Rob Houk, the producer I have watched the film repeatedly and followed it's progression through several film festivals. The reviews from critics that have addressed the acting skills have been favorable for most of the cast, and (deservedly) outstanding for Mari's role as Peggy Lester. Mari brilliantly captured the absolute essence of the sinner who can recognize all sins but their own. Rob did an outstanding job of producing, and one could only wish Mari and Rob had received at least some of the credit they obviously deserve from the director..

The story line is rather bizarre, but interesting so it's well worth the watch. The dark humor pulls it up just short of a serious insult to Christanity, and it's primary value is that of satire....intended or not.

All in all, it's entertaining and  does the job of showcasing my amazingly talented daughter.... and that's all good.",1203638400,15,960,4.91358024691358

8253718,3,B0014065LS,"Nice movie, not very deep and definitely pretentious. The movie was saved only by the performance of the lead actress who managed to make her character a real person rather than the cardboard cutouts of the other actors. Spoiler alert: Jesus makes an appearance, and I bet you didn't know that he was a tattooed hipster did you???",1523491200,,330,4.706896551724138

8253721,5,B0014065LS,"Mari Blackwell's portrayal of a young girl whose prayers are answered by a just God
has not gone unnoticed. All the the actors shine in this small budget film, but
Mari's performance is outstanding, considering the difficulty of keeping her importance in perspective.
I note her mother spoke up for her in a previous review and that is admirable and while it might seem
unnecessary it did change the way I remembered the film and gave it a more feminist and balanced
appeal. Worth buying! I downloaded it because it is a perfect movie to play on my TV Hat.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SKM-Industries-9303-Khaki-TV-Hat/dp/B003LNFTQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SKM Industries 9303 Khaki TV Hat</a>",1285027200,,742,5.87962962962963
8253722,4,B0014065LS,"The gist of the plot here is pretty simple - the Franklins are a very religious, church going family.  The type of family that is very active in the community.  In fact, they're on their way to one of their many community obligations when they're in a serious car accident.  Three of the four (the hubby, wife, and son)  experience some divine intervention while in their comas.  The daughter?  Well, she's not lucky enough to end up in a coma...

The negative reviews I've seen of this film seem to just state it's an attack on Christianity - so don't watch it.  You could see it as that, if that's what you want to see.  Personally, I didn't see it as that.  Just as in real life, there were both ""good"" and ""bad"" Christians in this movie.

Instead I saw this as a movie showing that we confuse concepts like faith, religion, church -- intermingling them as though we could say they're all the same thing when they're not necessarily.  It exposed hypocrites.  Examined how different people, some even of the same religion or faith and belonging to the same church may have different views on things.  It questioned how the pact mentality of people can damage things like churches / other social structures when the members do disagree on  issues.

The only negative for me was that there were times when some of the dialogue and  acting seemed a little - eh, flat?  Dull?  Forced?  I'm not sure what it was exactly but something was just a little off somehow.  Still, that said, if you're not offended by nudity and ""bad"" words I'd definitely give it a chance and look beyond the so called attacks on Christianity.",1280448000,3,1616,4.541666666666667
8253723,3,B0014065LS,"I may be in the minority with regards to this film's qualities, but I'll risk the ridicule and state my negatives ...along with some positives.

Most will note, however, that I DID give the film a positive rating. The ONLY reason I did was because the message was one I felt needed to be told in response to the religious right's ridiculous claims surrounding God, family, and Jesus' message.

Since I'm mostly an optimist, I'll start with the upside. Again, the message is great. This film's been called ""The perfect antidote to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B001JNNDGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>,"" and I couldn't agree more. It's just unfortunate that more positive qualities didn't shine through to help the message. But I'm getting negative. Back to the positives...

The message of God/Jesus releasing a family from original sin was refreshing and something I'd never dreamt of seeing on film. I thought the scenes where the Franklin family (minus their teen daughter) meet up with Jesus on an astral plain was filmed really well. Having Jesus be black was also a wonderful punch to the gut to the religious right who always view Jesus as some Caucasian with a flowing robe and beard. Watching Jesus chop down the crucifix was probably one of the more dark funny moments in the film for me. I've always complained that if Jesus ever came back to Earth, he'd be mighty peeved to learn what symbol we chose to remember him by.

It was also great to see friend and neighbor Peggy Lester (Mari C. Blackwell) caught in a moral dilemma when she's forced to choose between her Christian friends and her best friend (Teresa Willis). The pressure exerted by her right wing fanatical friends showed just how far removed some extremists are from Jesus' true message: forgiveness and forbearance.

Where the film sputtered (and nearly died!) was its script, including -- unfortunately -- the dialogue. Much of it was stilted and forced. A much more subtle approach to the dialogue would've come off as natural, but instead it just sounded lame. Too bad.

The lighting, sets, and other filming qualities were obviously low-budget. When I say ""obvious"" it really means ""very bad."" Again, unfortunate considering the powerful message this film was trying to get across.

I feel bad not being able to give this film a higher rating, mainly because I know that the right wing bizzarros out there are helping fund and promote things like The Passion of the Christ. And they'll certainly be trying to sweep this type of film under the rug.

Say? Was that Governor Sanford I just saw running and screaming out of the theater?",1253491200,3,2714,5.096846846846847
8253724,5,B0014065LS,"I will not burden you with the synopsis since other reviewers have given good snapshots of that . . . let me just say that this movie, at least for me, was much more of a religious experience than I've generally received from church!

Inspired writing, casting, acting . . . everything.  This little film could be the basis for an entire college course on theology.  I just can't believe I didn't find this gem earlier.

The entire cast is fabulous - but, none more so than Robertson Dean as Frank Franklin.  His matter-of-fact delivery of lines is dead-on perfect.  Teresa Willis as Betty Franklin brings a sweetness to the premise.

This movie literally blew me away.  It should be watched with friends so you have someone to discuss all of the nuances and turns with. . . I am quite sure there will be many interpretations of some of the scenes.

If you are trying to decide whether to buy this one -- buy it. . . buy it now -- this is one you'll want to watch again and share with others.",1243728000,,992,4.3478260869565215
8253725,5,B0014065LS,"Jay Floyd's ""Forgiving the Franklins"" provides thought-provoking material in an entertaining manner.  I've read one review that sets the film in North Carolina and another in North Dakota.  Regardless of exactly where the film is set, it is small town America.  The question the film poses is whether sexuality is truly anti-religious.  Obviously, the world wants the species to continue; so sex has to have its place.  But when does physical enjoyment and intimacy cross the line to become sordid?  In this film we have a family who through the miracle of an accident is relieved of the burden of original sin.  Jesus himself, played by Pop DaSilva, pulls a bloody apple out of the back of their heads thus relieving the mother, father and son of any sexual guilt.  Young Brian played by Vince Pavia has never dated girls.  The reason becomes clear when relieved of guilt he tells his coach who is massaging his hamstring that it is exciting.  Coach Caldwell played by Zak Spears as Kris Scaramanga joins Brian in the shower for Brian's first sexual experience.  Brian innocently tells his parents about it at the supper table.  Meanwhile, father Frank Franklin played by Robertson Dean who was in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" in 2002 & ""Vanilla Sky"" in 2001 is discovering his routine lovemaking with his wife has been transformed with an exciting freedom of enjoyment.  Betty Franklin is played by Teresa Willis whose lack of shame is reflected in sauntering into the yard in her birthday suit to retrieve the morning paper.  Their daughter Caroline Franklin is played by Aviva who had a part in ""Superbad"" in 2007.  Still riddled with guilt, she runs to her godmother Peggy Lester played by Mari Blackwell. Lester reports to the Christian women's association that quickly shuns the family and results in fanatical action, divorced from a gospel of love.  This is a very entertaining, very direct, very interesting picture that will offend those with a conservative traditional view of morality.  I found the film refreshing and significant, a low-budget gem.  Bravo!",1217289600,7,2062,4.97953216374269
8253726,1,B0014065LS,"Are you a fan of one-note, vile stereotypes? If so, buy this movie! If ever there was a piss poor excuse to seek revenge on the ""bad"" people who have done you wrong, this movie is it.  Beneath the indie / Sundance street cred, this absurd story is a hate letter to Christianity, masquerading as an avant-hipster satire.

The guy who wrote this should get off his pedestal and recognize that not all people of faith are morons and maniacs.  Some are perhaps, but really, all of them?  Really?  Just because you might have been discriminated against doesn't mean the rest of the world deserves a kick in the face. And this from a reviewer who isn't even remotely religious.

On the plus side, the acting rises above the laborious stereotypes when Mari C. Blackwell appears onscreen.  She brings volatile life to a chiched and overwritten character.  And the luminous Aviva captures both a vulnerability and confusion that's appropriate to a lost teenage soul.

That said... avoid like a rabid, poop throwin' monkey.",1215475200,2,1013,4.809248554913295
8253727,5,B0014065LS,"It's always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly good-hearted and well-intentioned, even when they're surrounded by those who are neither.  The film's moderately silly premise is that the conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teen boy and girl) are involved in an accident wherein the parents and brother have a near-death experience during which they meet Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul who removes from them the burden of 'original sin.'  When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the consternation of the daughter, who didn't share the experience.  The religious side is, I think, presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the starkly awful (those of his 'followers' who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own).  It's a movie to make you think, give you a few good laughs along the way, and leave you with the pleasant feeling the world just might be a better place than you think it is.  Maybe.",1213142400,15,1046,4.887005649717514
