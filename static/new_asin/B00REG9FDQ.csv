6929501,5,B00REG9FDQ,"I love this show, but for the season 7 DVD one reviewer said it contained only 12 episodes.  Yet the History Channel site lists 18 episodes.  What's going on here?  Will there be a Season 7, Vol. 2 released later on for another ""double dip""? Does anybody know?",1437696000,8,260,4.375

6929503,5,B00REG9FDQ,"This is a great series and I look forward to each new one. This particular set - I have to say I found a couple of episodes really far fetched in their ideas (which is saying a lot), BUT there are so many other things they bring up that just cannot be ""debunked"".  (Historical and physical evidence) Most of the time they bring up more questions.  Either the ancients were more technologically advanced than we are today (and where did the technology go), or they had ""help"".  (And those are some of the questions they bring up.)  Really interesting show.  This set DOES have English subtitles for the hearing impaired, no extras, 3 discs, 12 episodes.",1437609600,6,652,4.586206896551724

6929505,5,B00REG9FDQ,"In my opinion the Ancient Aliens series should not be Cancelled until the Aliens say, ""Enough already, We're here!""... ""Been here for a long time by your reckoning. Nice planet you have. Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful. Blue Sky, Blue Ocean, a real Blue Moon of a planet. A Rare Jewel in the Cosmos indeed..."" At least I hope their World Wide Web announcement will offer us some hope. Of course with times being as Bipolar as anyone can remember CNN will be for intermarriage and Fox will be for deportation. Some things never change. It's about the ratings, not the treble. Like any of our opinions really matter that much where Aliens capable of sailing across the Cosmos are concerned. I hope the Aliens have a cosmic sense of humor. Otherwise I fear we may be screwed, blewed, and tattooed. I hope they will not give up on us. That they have had and will continue to have our best interests at heart. That said, they will probably say something like, ""Your Planet?!"". I hope they don't release a great big Manthropomorphic Robot Insectoide Locust Thingy that devours every living thing on Earth. I will not stand still for that. If they must I hope they have found a Noah and his family even if it is not mine. It happened at least once. It can happen again.

Fact is, the Ancient Alien Theorists are rewriting History right before our eyes. It is all so obvious really. There are planets much older than ours that produced civilizations much longer ago than ours. Some of these became godlike in their technological capabilities. Some of them probably think they are gods. Like apples on a tree some are good and some not so good. Good Angels, Bad Angels, that sort of thing. I hope the good guys win knowing that in the long run all things have a way of evening out. Here on Earth TV Preachers tell me if I will send them some of my money then ""GAAWWD"" will make me rich. One can only hope Alien Preachers have no such hidden agenda. That their plan for us is not just another Ponzi scheme variant. That they actually know God, at least a lot better than most of us do. That for them love is the gravity of metaphysics.

I am reminded of the only time that Jesus lost his cool according to the Constantine Canon. It wasn't at a Tavern, or a House of Disrepute. No, it was at Church. He lost it at the Temple. Even the Prince of Peace could stand only so much hypocrisy in the name of godliness. I believe he would have a real problem with today's Prosperity Preachers. ""My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers."" Matthew 21:12-17. Sorry for the digression, I guess I temporarily lost it. Don't even get me started about how he felt about the Teachers of the Law. About the Guardians of the Status Quo. Woe to them. Matthew 23.

Anyway, enough preaching by me, the Ancient Aliens series though not without production flaws and sometimes grasping at straws is in my opinion one of the most, if not the most, important and interesting programs ever aired on TV. Anyone with an open mind should be all over this. For me the pieces just keep falling into place. The truth shall set us free.",1431216000,29,3132,4.443478260869565

6929516,5,B00REG9FDQ,"Some may call Ancient Aliens far-fetched but no one can accuse it of not being well thought out and entertaining. I find it interesting how the show can take pretty much any subject and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

So why does Amazon call this volume one and the new artwork on the cover clearly says Season 7? Originally, the seventh season of Ancient Aliens was scheduled to have 20 episodes and they were going to be released on dvd split across two volumes like Lionsgate has been doing for the last couple seasons. For some reason, Season 7 ended on May 1st after only twelve episodes aired. So is this some sort of Alien Conspiracy? Perhaps.

So here we have all twelve episodes of Season 7 evenly spread across three dvds and are as follows...

Disc One:
01 Forbidden Caves
02 Mysteries Of The Sphinx
03 Aliens Among Us
04 The Genius Factor

Disc Two:
05 Secrets Of The Mummies
06 Alien Resurrections
07 Alien Messages
08 The Great Flood

Disc Three:
09 Aliens And The Civil War
10 Hidden Pyramids
11 The Vanishings
12 The Alien Agenda

Video: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:78 anamorphic widescreen transfer.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 5.1 Dolby Digital. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

Extras: None",1504310400,48,1334,4.594936708860759

Their was some old information and skits taken from past seasons, which I did find slightly annoying.

6929592,1,B00REG9FDQ,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season 7"" released by History.
As faithful readers of my reviews know, I do not reward inaccuracies, out right lies, and prejudice of any kind in any of the media forms I read, watch, and/or listen to
So, I'll save some of the suspense: ZERO STARS is going to ""Ancient Aliens - Season 7"" for it's anti-Semitism. If Ancient Aliens wants to deny the existence of Israel by replacing it with the non-existent country of Palestine in two episodes during this season then it alienates a good part of its viewing audience. SHAME on the executives of the History Channel for allowing this blatant anti-Semitic statement and giving such hate mongering its silent support.
And SHAME on Seth Shostak and other members of the Planetary Society for appearing on a program that is promoting anti-Semitism.
Sadly, despite the overall silliness factor of ""Ancient Aliens - Season 7,"" I can not recommend it because it promotes anti-Semitism.
NOT RECOMMENDED!
ZERO STARS!",1456358400,2,996,5.006024096385542
6929593,4,B00REG9FDQ,"Great series! I am always intrigued by the content which does make you think about our human origins here on Earth.
You'd think it would end after three maybe four seasons, but I'm now ready to watch Season 8! If you have an interest in this
topic...I recommend the entire series from the first season. It's nice to see some of the ""experts"" still on the show
after all these years.  (There is only one DVD set in the season, not Volume One of Two.)",1456185600,,449,4.2823529411764705

As for the episodes, they are what they are, you like them or your don't. the real question for me is why they are on season 10 and the latest DVD set you can get is season 7.

8695227,4,B00REG9FDQ,"I love Ancient Aliens,  but over the past day or so,  I have realized these boxed sets and season 5vol 2-10 are ALL LABELED WRONG.
1-5 is Correct,  then 5 vol 2 and Season 6 Volume 1 and 2 are actually Season 7 and 8,  then the individual season after that are wrong in their boxes too.
Selling as Season 7, is actually Season 9,  Season 8 is actually Season 10.
So if you buy all Seasons 1-10 you actually have all Season 1-12 as they aired and are listed on IMDB and History Channel.
I am not sure how all this happened and then continued to happen.

Think of it this way,  there is actually No Volume 1 and 2 for seasons 5 and 6.  Its actually Season 5-8.
Seems like someone else would have caught this prior and made changes.  But no,  they just keep selling them all listed WRONG>",1530921600,2,785,4.105263157894737
