6658781,2,B00NJ4UZI6,"I guess what the producers tried to do is make the show as real life-like as possible and so they used specific filming techniques and dialogue writing. Overall this resulted in some incredibly stupid and annoying conversations between the family members and the voices (especially womens) were like listening to a constant chainsaw. I wanted to see how the story ends and so I actually watched the entire show, but I have to admit that some of the characters were beyond annoying (Amber and Drew for example). At times I even wanted to skip their scenes. Overall, not worth the time or the money.",1456617600,,597,4.75

6658806,5,B00NJ4UZI6,I started watching Parenthood a few years after it started on TV and was instantly hooked. What a great show with well developed characters. I was very sad that Season 6 was the last season and that it wasn't even a full season. Were there moments that seemed predictable? Sure. But I was intrigued to see what would happen to the Braverman clan as they wrapped up the show.,1455235200,,374,4.434782608695652

I like Bedelia and Nelson - the two main reasons I even bother watching.",1451606400,,383,4.277777777777778

Every situation came across exactly as they occur, with people talking at the same time, interacting as individuals and as a family group... I won't go into the details, (to avoid spoilers) but I would have liked certain things to turn out differently.

It's too bad - many of us didn't find out how well written this series was until after the final episode.  The character developement is so well done - it's one of my favorite series ever produced.  I only discovered the Parenthood series within the past 4 months, and have watched all eposides from beginning to end.  In another 6 months I think I would like to watch every eposisode again.  Through out the series, I have vacillated between liking and not liking certain characters . . . I'm sure this was the intent of the writers/producers --- making the characters so very real, but in the end all of the characters have an amazing ability to pull the viewer deeper into the plot.

It is truly evident that thru this show these folks have formed a secondary family of choice. With all the other s***e available to watch, I'm so grateful that there is at least one show indicative of a loving family getting thru it all supporting one another rather than killing someone off every 15 minutes.

Watched all 6 seasons in about a 9 month time span, and we just kept waiting for it to be so awesome.  We had heard all this great stuff, and people acting incredulous when they found out that we had never seen it.  Maybe it was just too hyped up for us, or maybe it truly is a series meant to be seen only once a week for a few months of the year over a six year time period.  Many of the characters just got so annoying to us, and there was always, always so much drama.  I get that there is drama in real life, and the family and sibling dynamic, yada, yada, yada, but this was an unreal amount of drama for one family.  A yuppie, upper middle class, liberal, Berkely, granola family.  Now the original movie that this series is based on from 1989 with Steve Martin? Now THAT is fantastic, and I highly recommend!",1445212800,,903,4.155172413793103

6659836,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"Each season of this show was exceptional, thoughtful, emotional, and personal. Season 6 is a magnificent conclusion to a series of intertwined stories that loyal viewers have enjoyed from beginning to end. Every person can relate to at least one of the characters, and many of the situations the chracters find themselves in.

This is not a classic feel-good show by any means, but it delivers a positive emotional experience. It exposes the raw nerves of emotion, struggle, pain, and regret. It features bad choices and gut-wrenching consequences. However, what makes this show a work of genius is its ability to find the joy, happiness, and acceptance of all aspects of life, good and bad - and the show certainly includes ample portions of good times amidst the tragic. The Bravermans are a tight-knit family, who have their share of scraps among themselves, but never forget who they are and where they come from.

Mo member of the extended family is spared from heartache. You'd think a show loaded with divorce, infidelity, Aspergers, cancer, heart disease, job loss, teen pregnancy, failing business, death, and more, would be a major downer. But the show was able to find peace and joy in the struggle, in overcoming obstacles.

The final season, and certainly the final episode, did not disappoint its fan base. It's one of the great finales in the history of TV. They clearly took the time and care to end the series with grace and dignity, sorrow and joy (mostly joy). The fact that is hasn't won or even been nominated for an Emmy (Best Drama Series) is an injustice. It stands tall against anything HBO, Showtime, AMC, and other networks have produced over its 6 year run..

If there is one defining message, it's that you should be true to yourself, and by living that philosophy, despite some likely short term pain in doing so, you'll be on the best path to true happiness.",1437523200,2,1889,4.803076923076923

and would highly recommend this Show & this Series to anyone that knows or wants to know what being a family is all about.

I also did not like how tidy all the pieces came together unlike the authenticity of the rest of the show.  The last episode just zipped you through too many trivial tie up scenes with too many hanging questions for the end of the show.  The way they handled hard topics was brilliant.  The 4 stars was really for the last episode but the series in general was flat out five stars for me.

Those characters are still with me.",1431129600,,543,4.223300970873787

6660314,4,B00NJ4UZI6,"This is a really good show, with excellent story telling, great character development, and it pulls no punches about the highs and lows of being a parent.  In fact, it would easily have earned the rare (for me) 5 stars, but for two intensely annoying choices by the creators: first, the song during the opening credits is an almost comically bad example of the worst Bob Dylan can do to a song (and this is from someone who really likes Bob Dylan); in the 5th season, they canned the offending song in favor of something much more tolerable, seeming to recognize how atrocious it was, but then they stupidly brought it back for the final season!  Second, the writers have some kind of fetish for having characters talk over each other.  Yes, it sometimes happens in the real world, but when they have it happen in nearly every episode, it gets pretty annoying.  Overall, we still really enjoyed the show, and I recommend it, but the creators need to develop some insight and concern for their audience before doing another show.",1430438400,,1028,4.662983425414365

6660452,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"So sad to say goodbye to the Braverman clan, but all good things must come to an end, right? This season ties up some loose ends among the relationships in the Braverman family. We see resolution in the Julia-Joel drama, the birth of Amber's child, what becomes of Zeek after heart problems surfaced earlier in the season, the outcome of Sarah and Hank's relationship, what's in store for Adam and Crosby at the Luncheonette, and more. The final episode is bittersweet and not to be missed. There's no wondering ""what if"" either, as the episode provides a glimpse into the future lives of the Braverman clan. Just wish we could see more. Great show. One of the best.",1428019200,4,666,4.6525423728813555

Actors did a good job, some were too bossy at times, but part of the complexion of the series.  Parents were too indulgent with the Asberger, not a good message to send that they rule the whole family. I have an autistic grandchild and the parents are not near as lenient with her as we watch her grow up with some rules that have changed her dramatically. Her school heralds her improvement. We use essential oils that has helped considerably in her relationships, it is calming influence.",1425686400,,767,4.356643356643357

You will find something/some character to connect with. It tells life like it is - messy, complicated, and confusing but always leaves you feeling uplifted. This show has such a real heart and truth to it, I miss it terribly already.

6660645,1,B00NJ4UZI6,"This is a show about horrible, self-centered people. I endured the first few seasons because my sister encouraged me to watch it. I held onto hope that it would get better and it never did. These people are all terrible parents - it's one generation after another of ridiculously spoiled people. I just don't get the hype. I felt no empathy towards any of the characters by the time season six rolled around and it's gotten to the point where I get extremely irritated by the repetitive things said by some characters (Kristina ""hey buddy""ing her kid or Zeke ""hey Grandson""ing Drew - ugh). I thought about inventing a drinking game involving shots anytime Amber cries, but I'd probably develop a liver disorder. I've watched the entire series except the last episode. I'm holding out hope that in the finale the Bravermans rent a bus that takes a tumble off the Pacific Coast Highway.

6660688,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"Parenthood Season 6 has been a stellar moment for me every week.  The strength of the cast, the story lines, situations and dialog are all topnotch..  I missed the wedding, but the rest of this season was enormously satisfying.  I started watching during Season 1 due to Max, because I have an autistic nephew.  Max's character developed and examined so well that my fears and worries about him have been allayed thanks to your show.  All of your characters have been enormously satisfying through the years.  Thanks to all of you for your devotion to story and performance.  I will enjoy seeing the cast in their subsequent new roles as some have shown up already.j",1424822400,2,666,4.739130434782608
6660689,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"I loved this program and it was the only one I really made a point of watching every week at 10 p.m. on Thursday. I felt part of the family. I was totally surprised with the ending on the season finale and rewatched it (the ending) several times. I loved Parenthood so much that I am now watching the reruns from Day 1. This was a classic program that is in the same category as Father Knows Best, Leave It To Beaver, Ozzie & Harriet, and others.

6660693,2,B00NJ4UZI6,"I guess you have to be a liberal Californian to appreciate this show. It's a story about a family of self centered whinny people that compete for the center of attention . They are all anti religion, pro abortion and anti military. I was amazed at how they would lose their job and be in financial straights one episode and money being no object the next. You will also have to watch about 4 seasons before someone completes a sentence because they communicate with each other by babbling and mumbling . The children were all screwed up because the parents did not discipline them in any way and try to be their friend instead of their parent and  I did wonder if that is what they were trying to portray  . If you want a fantasy soap opera this is for you .",1424649600,,758,4.293706293706293

Shame on you.

I love the series. Hate that the final season spoiled it for me.

WHY bring this problem with Zeek into the final season?
For a ""real"" ending? I get enough painful reality in real life!

What statement did you hope to make by killing off Zeek?? No matter how ""tastefully"" done, it was wrong.
I want - need - HAPPY endings on TV, in movies. TV is, for most of us, entertainment, an escape from real life.
I want Zeek to live happily ever after with the rest of the clan!

That it was the recipient of few, if any, awards does not diminish its artistry; but, sadly, exposes how inconsequential the self-acclaimed ""experts"" in programming quality have become.  The greatness of ""Parenthood's"" legacy will, we believe, continue to grow in the years ahead... and it is a fitting tribute that its six seasons will now become a treasured part of DVD collections--to be viewed again and again; and, especially important, made available to those who did not have an opportunity to experience the artistry of ""Parenthood"" when it originally aired.

I don't think I would want to go away with too much reality around that part of the ending.  I see lots of reviews say how real to life this series is to them.

6660964,2,B00NJ4UZI6,"I'm going to go against the general populace here and point out that this show's writers seem to bend over backwards to suggest that the 'average' child is unruly and undisciplined, and that most parents refuse to do anything to correct or discipline their children.  When this series first came out, I really thought it would be a nice family-oriented show.  Needless to say, this is a dangerous series that teaches children that it is okay to act out and whine and scream until they get what they want.  Would not recommend for any family to watch.",1417478400,2,550,4.649484536082475

I had not been watching it until I did a binge watch of the first five seasons and I was amazed at just how great it is.  Now I cannot wait for each episode of Season Six (alas the final season of the series!!).  All the characters in this family are quirky and imperfect - just like normal human beings - and imperfectly go through everyday experiences. But even in its ""normalness"" each character is developed into a complicated and endearing personality that you can love while you groan at and/or cheer their behavior.

Spoiler:

I will say that the school arc is a bit over the top. So much is going on in episodes 1 and 2.  There are not enough hours in a week to accomplish all that the Bravermans do in the first episode. Adam is all over the map as to where his responsibilities lie. When is he going to snap?  When does the man sleep?  Who is taking care of Nora while all this going on? I would think grandma would have more of a care-giving role. If Hattie is home, why isn't she taking care of Nora or running errands? Or Julia since she seems to have half her evenings ""free."" (OMG! Go Julia!)  As to the Amber situation...For someone supposedly so smart, she's an idiot. I hope that she realizes that she will have to move in with somebody to make ends meet. Please let it be someone other than Sarah...her influence of ""do as I say, not as I do"" will wreck another generation. Won't somebody get some religion already!  I realize that it's California,  but somebody other than Jasmine ' s mom must be involved in a church or synagogue or something!

6661274,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"Just one episode in and one can tell that this will be a fitting farewell to the Braverman family after six much-loved seasons. I first started watching this show on my brother's recommendation in 2010 and was immediately hooked. It is brilliantly scripted and acted, always ringing true. The actors speak what seems to be real dialogue in a realistic manner often interrupting and speaking over one another. I don't know about your family, but that is exactly what mine does. There are two aging parents and four adult children, each with their own families. These characters seem real, flaws and all. The plots never stoop to a soap opera level they are always true to life and topical. And while many current issues in modern life are played out, it does not seem like a season of Oprah, everything is done with a light hand. This season seems to be no exception. In the first episode we pick up where they left off last season with just enough time passing to have brought about the changes hinted at previously. One actually cares about this fictional family, and while it will be sad to see them go, I'm sure that this last season will bring closure and resolution.",1412121600,21,1171,4.634615384615385

6661279,5,B00NJ4UZI6,"Parenthood is one of the finest shows to ever air on network television. The writing is second to none, and the characters are as real as they get. The series breaks new ground with every episode, and captures real life situations in a way never seen before on network TV. It's a rarity to see topical issues treated in such a fair and honest way, all with a wonderful blend of drama, humor and insight.

With each episode, my wife and I feel as if we're a part of this incredible family. While I'm happy that it was renewed for an abbreviated sixth season, I'm sad that it won't be around for a seventh. In my opinion, this series is ending way before the story is fully told.",1411257600,29,677,4.2890625
