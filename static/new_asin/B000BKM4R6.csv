8087962,5,B000BKM4R6,"One of the Hindi movies I really liked-perhaps a complicated story, but no more so than other Hindi films. Thank goodness no disco dancing, or a story about rich people, or lost brothers. It was about real people, their handships and struggles, of how people of all religions and social groups can work together, and of the importance of families, natural or man-made. The Pani song was terrific,the settings felt genuine, and all the acting was good.",1178496000,,451,4.87012987012987
