8647622,5,B00J32ST3Q,"The DVD itself is without damage and in excellent condition from the seller.  The movie itself was a favorite that I had seen once on television.  After watching for the movie to go on sale, I was happy to be able to purchase it.  It has an excellent story line, which I think better reflects life in general for a lot of people.  The ending is humbling. One of my favorites.",1399852800,,375,4.23943661971831
