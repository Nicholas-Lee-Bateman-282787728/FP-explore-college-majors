7981181,4,B00008AOS0,"You can't buy much for $5.98, but you can buy this cool Classic Sci-Fi DVD set. The set features 3 cheapy Sci-Fi films. The transfer for Teenagers from Outer Space is nice and clean! The other two are good prints. They are not as clean as teenagers,but they may never have been. If you like these cheesy cheap flicks,this is worth the price of admission.",1183939200,2,354,4.461538461538462
7981182,5,B00008AOS0,"but NOT for ""In the Year 2889"" which somehow escaped being camp and is just plain awful.  In fact, it is probably the longest 80 minutes you will ever experience.

""Teenagers,"" on the other hand, is marvelous, and even well made.  How'd THAT happen?

""They Came from Beyond Space"" is a British effort that is kinda ok...maybe being British saves it--whatever.",1161388800,,359,4.836065573770492

TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE is excellent. This is a highly entertaining and memorable movie - one of my favorites for all around 50's quality sci-fi. Aliens arrive on a spaceship determined to colonize Earth with craw-dads that will grow to enormous size and become a food source. Nerdy alien teen breaks off and heads into town and takes a room in a house with an earth teen girl and GrandPa. Mean alien teen has to track nerd teen down and bring him back. Suspenseful as he almost catches up to them as they go about the town. Has a ray gun that turns people into skeletons. Car chases. Car crash off a cliff. Pushy press people. Doctor's office in a house (total 50's). The default movie cave thats been in N sci-fi movies.

IN THE YEAR 2889 is pretty good. After a nuclear war 8 people end up in an isolated valley saved by vertical convection from a warm lake that carries radiation away. Grandpa is in charge and carries a side-arm. Donna Reed's son and his brother arrive early and he falls in love with GrandPas daughter. The brother gets infected and loses his appetite - never eats but has a craving for meat, spends all his time roaming the woods looking for rabbits. Alcoholic low-life and 60's psychedelic floosy dancer girlfriend arrive and add suspense to the movie. Pervasive is the lurking outside of GrandPas son who is infected and looks like a monster and roams the woods spying on the girls as they bath in the pool. Movie is worth an hour and half every 15 years or so.

THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE is not very good. Like the cars that went downhill after 1965, this is a 1967 color not very good film. English movie too. Best part is later in the film when the hero and side-kick figure out wearing a metal strainer on their heads will protect them from alien attempts to take over their brains. I saw this about 20 years ago and wouldn't waste my time on it again.",1099440000,18,1924,4.398876404494382
7981184,5,B00008AOS0,"IN THE YEAR 2889...It has been thirty hours since the Nuclear attack.  Everyone is gone, except for an old, grumpy, father who is protective of his teenage daughter.  She fears that her boyfriend is dead.  But he does show up at the doorstep with horrible radioactive burns to him.  His brother (Paul Petersen, ""The Donna Reed Show"") who is fine stays with him.  Other people begin to show up at this house too who appear to be fine.  They all must avoid contamination.  Who will survive?
  Filmed in 1967, this film is scientifically inaccurate and is not a survival guide to actually surviving outside radiation, which does seep inside a house in real life.  But this film is fun to watch.  Also recommend THE DAY AFTER (1983) and TESTAMENT (1983).
TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE...UFO lands on Earth.  The human-like shipmates are from a planet that treats there own like slaves.  They are trying to find a planet to release their Gargons.  One shipmate wants to do good.  He commits treason to try to stop his other shipmates from allowing Gargons on Earth.  A book he has kept hidden and read (like a Holy Bible) as changed his mind to do right.  He wants to do right.  When his shipmates killed a dog, the good alien tells them the creature had life.  This is not the place to release Gargons.  His shipmates disagree.  The good alien, Derek, escapes from his shipmates.  He meets the people of this fine town.  The bad aliens try to find Derek, but shoot other people into skeletons with a raygun.
  Dvd also includes THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE (1967).",1084233600,6,1556,4.611721611721611
