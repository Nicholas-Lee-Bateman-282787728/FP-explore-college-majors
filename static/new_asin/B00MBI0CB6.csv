8671430,4,B00MBI0CB6,"The atmosphere of ""A Dark Place Inside"" is reminiscent of ""Don't Go Into The House"" and ""Maniac"". The acting is above low budget scale with Chris Dalbey really bringing to life this monster in total, disturbing reality. The cinematography is more traditional, surrealism that really sells stories this extreme. ""A Dark Place Inside"" gets pretty much everything right in the execution of this really dark, macabre story, raising the overall quality to higher standards than one expects from low budget, indie horror.

The special effects in ""A Dark Place Inside"" is a bit on the cheaper side, which-when the camera lingers too long-becomes really clear. However every bit of this film is told with practical, classic special effects and (even on the cheaper side) is still better and more effective than what I expected. The scenes are gory, graphic and beyond disturbing. The soundtrack is a total instrumental overture of unsettling emotion. Eerie, atmospheric sounds carry the story continuously- I don't think there was a scene that didn't have this chilling arrangement accompanying it.

Overall ""A Dark Place Inside"" is great proof that the modern American giallo film is very much alive. I enjoyed this film from start to finish. The cast give applaud-able performances, the concept is twisted with an even more twisted story, and horror echoes through every minute of this film. Andy is as nightmarish a boogeyman as Dahmer, and Frank Zito. Definitely watch this film. It is slasher, it is giallo, and it is intensely entertaining!",1431475200,2,1538,5.148

8671432,4,B00MBI0CB6,"I was hesitant to watch this film due to all the junk that has been thrown together this year but I'm very pleased I took a chance on it!

One of the reasons this film worked so well is it's star Christopher Dalbey. His character is a serial killer with a torturous past that haunts him while he stalks the city looking for his prey which are young women.

He keeps ""his collection"" as he calls it in his run down apartment in the city .His collection consists of various body parts of women,his favorite being heads ,hands and one decaying torso that one assumes by the way he shows affection towards it, uses for necrophilia!

The visuals are perfectly done not using overkill with the gore effects but with realism and that's another reason this film works so well. It paints the perfect picture of dread and horror. It will definitely creep you out.",1413590400,,853,4.490322580645161

Write & Directed by: Mike OMahony.

Lets just say,A Dark Placeis well made and filmed with tons of scares,gore,hopes for retribution and a villian that should be high on a list of villians OF ALL TIME.

The lead actor,Chris Dalbey brings a sense of terror,That really goes Balls to the wall with sheer intense,vitriolic glee.

The women are awesome,for the brief moments they are allowed to shine,If you will. The co-worker was one I was glad got offed(spoiler ?).The parents ,Ummwell,ewwww.

The tools,devices,accessories of villianare amazing in their use and put to use they are.",1411516800,3,604,5.0606060606060606
