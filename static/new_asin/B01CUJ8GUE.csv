Highly recommended to check this movie out, liked Michael Joiner from other movies in this. Don't be scared to watch but you can learn something Scott forgiveness. :-)",1464134400,,339,4.762711864406779
7690035,3,B01CUJ8GUE,"Sometimes you have hope when you pop in a DVD after viewing the trailer and truly look forward to a great movie. Other times, you wind up disappointed, that perhaps the best scenes of said movie were all combined in the trailer. That is the case with Chasing Grace by Catalyst Pictures. Now on DVD courtesy of Word Films, this is the story of one pastor's family and how they handle the grief and loss that comes when their daughter Grace is accidentally shot when she finds the gun her uncle Carter (David Temple) had brought to her birthday party. The uncle was just released from jail by his brother and pastor Jonathan Matheson (Michael Joiner), and had passed out in the family home when the tragedy happened.

Now each member of the family processes their grief in very different ways. Jonathan picks up drinking to bypass the pain same as his brother and father. He tries to hide it from his wife and board members of his church but soon even those lies are brought to lie with very profound circumstances. His wife Angela (Ashlee Payne), buries her feelings in trying to get the family back to normal as quickly as possible which leaves her in dark depression that even counseling can't seem to help. Her two remaining sons, Christopher, the oldest, has to fend off bullies at school and finds solace following in his father's footsteps to see how alcohol might help ease the pain. He soon finds himself in jail. While the youngest, David struggles to understand just what is happening to his family and how he can try to help.

I received Chasing Grace by Catalyst Pictures compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation, aside for a free copy of this DVD in exchange for my personal evaluation either favorable or not. I have to say, I was not that impressed. The story line is boring and the pace of the film moves so slowly, you find yourself wondering just how much longer this film can drag the story out. Each character's evolution into grief in so slow paced, you simply wish they'd get it over with, so you can find other things to do. While the run time on this is 96 minutes, anything longer than a hour is beyond brutal. I had to keep trying to find a way to convince myself to finish this in order to see how it might all end up. You have a pastor trying to convince and manipulate the local police to take vengeance on his brother in any viable means possible even killing him if need be. While I understand processing grief is different for everyone, I think the point of finding forgiveness is so missing until the final moments, that most people would turn it off before getting that far. These are not characters you feel any kind of connection with and therefore are missing that factor of wanting to know how it all turns out for any of them. For me, this one was a 3 out of 5 stars in my opinion, and even that might be a bit generous. This is just my opinion but others might have a different one than what I posted here.",1464048000,4,3016,4.4324324324324325
7690036,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"Chasing Grace is a fantastic DVD. So many issues are covered in this DVD. I wanted to see Chasing Grace ever since Ive heard of it. Really glad I got the chance to watch and review it.
  When you watch this you will see how secrets always comes out, but not always in the way you would think. Chasing Grace talks about problems like alcoholism, guilt, death, grief and redemption. Really Chasing Grace is a love story about family.
  Chasing Grace is about a young girl and a tragedy that haunts her family and friends until everyone is blaming themselves that it happened. How this family came through it and the steps they took to bring it about.
  A lot of harsh things are said, but needed saying and that in itself was a help. It amazes me how one life touches so many others. How many people are touched by one mistake.
  I really like this DVD Chasing Grace as it helps us all see that only going with God completely and giving everything over to Him will make our lives right and keep us right.
  Really fantastic DVD that makes us all think that we aren't alone in this life and our lives touch so many others.

7690044,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"This movie has an excellent plot that has its origin several decades earlier but gets unraveled quickly when, to the shock of the whole town, a young child is killed at her own birthday party. She is the daughter of a local pastor and his wife who have two older boys.
At the burial scene, the pastors brother (Carter) shows up but having been known for his extensive drinking, having to be bailed out of jail regularly, and legally carrying a concealed weapon, is not welcomed. Perceived as the modern-day equivalent of the Prodigal son, the family, for the most part, has rejected him. The role is played extremely well by David Temple who also wrote the script and directed the movie.
The movie is filled with great dialogue and irony including the pastor preaching a week earlier about forgiveness and saying its like a hug; cant give one without getting one in return. But then off to the police station to bail his brother out again.
Back to the funeral, Carters brother (Jonathan the pastor) makes it clear Carter is not wanted at the house any longer but Carter refuses to accept the edict. Subsequently, the local sheriff tells Jonathan he has ways that can teach his brother a real lesson if the pastor wanted him to. Aware of all this animosity, one of the two boys also gets aggressive and that has its own sub-plot which in itself is most engaging. Meanwhile the mother, objects to her husband not forgiving his brother. And the conflict now spreads to several fronts.
Three months later as equilibrium starts to set in the pastor gets into a mysterious car accident with a friends car and the older teenage is charged with speeding and DUI  but not until he discovers something that ends up being crucial to the life of the whole family, for in one sense theres more than one prisoner in this story.
As the family starts to fall apart, mother plans a surprise family outing  to a psychologist and there, because shes on to her husbands habits, she breaks down and orders her husband to come clean or else begging that the negative legacy stop. Ashlee Payne (with many other movie credits to her name) does a great job in that role.
Carter who wants to be forgiven by his brother, remarks, Youre not sounding very Christian; how can you not forgive me?  A good question. And the answer lies in Jons past. That leads to the revealing of more of the history between the brothers and the family they grew up in. Still no resolve and soon Carter considers taking his own life, holding his gun to his own head.
The truth has a way of coming to the surface, and it is not long before the elders of his church ask Jonathan to take a leave of absence.  The younger son starts to think about his role in his little sisters death and once again mother comes up with the answers he and perhaps many of us who have had similar question in our own lives, need to hear.
Brother Carter is arrested and roughed up  more than was intended and ultimately is believed to have drowned.
At long last, we are allowed to see what really happened that day at the birthday party as Jonathan starts to reflect on his role in the death of his beautiful little girl.
The rest of the story and all the suspense along the way, Ill leave for you to watch.  Suffice it to say, that with the exception of a gun being held to ones head, while no actual shooting or death is seen on camera, this is a great family story with lots to talk about afterward.  Highly recommended.
The movie ends with a gentle reminder as follows: Most people focus on the prodigal son when they hear that story, but we should never forget the importance of the brother.",1474156800,2,3626,4.468277945619335

7690047,5,B01CUJ8GUE,"The messages I took from this movie is that Pastor's are not perfect and can also struggle with vices and wanting vengeance just like anyone who is in pain. We tend to think our sins won't be found out but they do catch up to us in the long run. Lastly, tragedies can make a family stronger or it can tear families apart. The title ""Chasing Grace"" serves to remind us that we all need to chase grace, because God's grace is what gives us a blessing that we really don't deserve.",1466553600,,478,4.206521739130435
7690048,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"The accidental death of a child is the catalyst that sends family members spiraling in different directions. The movie deals with forgiveness and how people handle it while not facing their own issues.
Dealing with alcoholism, violence, revenge and grief, the movie shows how model families can be dysfunctional underneath their perfect exterior. It shows how secrets and lies build and take on a life of their own until they destroy.
The message of forgiveness comes through as the family copes with the loss in their own flawed way.

7690051,2,B01CUJ8GUE,"I had seen the trailer for this movie on another DVD I watched. The trailer made me excited to see ""Chasing Grace"". Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer. ""Chasing Grace"" has a viable premise but the story quickly loses focus when the Matheson family deals with more mental, social, spiritual, emotional and moral issues than one movie can deal with. The theme of forgiveness is lost in the family secrets, alcoholism, lying, accidental deal, depression, fighting and everything else happening in the movie.

I do my best to support the Christian movie but I suggest you pass on ""Saving Grace"". I received this movie for free for my honest review.",1465516800,,664,4.876106194690266
7690052,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"I am a bit on the fence about ""Chasing Grace."" I liked it, but I didn't love it. Great message, but it was a little slow in getting to the purpose of the film and I sometimes got confused during the telling of the story. Layers of the story were revealed throughout the film, but some never did make complete sense to me. Of course, part of my experience was simply a personal inability to comprehend why anyone would act or react to a situation the way they did. I needed more indepth into characters than what was provided since nothing appeared to be black and white; yet the shades of gray were inefficient to understand motive for all. The acting, music, and cinematography were all good, but my mind did tend to wander. It's more of a 3.75 for me, but I will round up and give it 4 stars.

7690053,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"A movie about family, loss, forgiveness and redemption. Chasing Grace forces us to turn toward our faith as a family struggles to find a new ""normal"" as they go move on after losing their daughter.

Pastor Jonathan Matheson and his family have lost their little Grace due to the negligence of a family member.  With the family falling apart the Pastor is hit with a wave of anger and vengeance.

What seemed like a model community family is really quite dysfunctional behind the scenes which I think is something everyone can relate to.

The movie touches on alcoholism, violence, guns, and even shady cops but in the end the message is important.  My favorite character was ""Professor"" the middle child. He was the only one who seemed to have it together. The voice of reason.

This is not your typical preachy movie about forgiveness. I think some will be surprised at some of the directions the movie takes you however the final message is about forgiveness of others and forgiveness of ourselves.

All in all the actors did a decent job over all.",1465257600,2,1050,4.704918032786885
7690054,5,B01CUJ8GUE,"Movies like Chasing Grace show us a bit about what happens when normal, God-fearing people deal with human emotions and human realities in the face of truly difficult circumstances. Every day we face temptations to walk away from God's perfect will for our lives and there are very real consequences which this movie explores well.

Overall I felt that the movie moves at a pretty good pace and has some great actors and actresses in it. It also included a bit of a twist I didn't see coming which is always a welcome surprise.",1465171200,,527,4.6063829787234045

7690058,4,B01CUJ8GUE,"Chasing Grace is a wonderful DVD about the power of grace and forgiveness. A pastor's happy family is shattered by a tragic accident that takes their youngest member's life. Pastor Jonathan Mattheson struggles with unforgiving heart, guilt, shame, and desire for vengeance. To deal with his loss, he finds it easier to put all his energy into being mad at and getting even with his brother whom he blames for his daughter's death. But it only makes matters worse. I think most people (if not all) can relate to issues of blaming, addiction, secrets, difficulty to forgive others and selves, and family relationships played out in this movie. The cast did a good job. The message is important. Nobody is beyond God's grace! May we give grace to others and forgive others as Jesus has done for us! Hope you'll check out Chasing Grace!

8754200,3,B01CUJ8GUE,"I watch Christian movies hoping to find one that just rises above the rest...the sappy movies with poor acting. Well this one is okay, certainly not as bad as some. But I guess, having been married one time to an alcoholic at one time, I strongly feel they treat  the subject too lightly. This family was severely damaged and fragmented by alcohol and more than just repentance and forgiveness are needed, although those are certainly the most important things. They should have addressed the strong need for treatment and the families part in that.
Also, what in the world is okay about cops acting that way???? Why don't they address this? That confounded me!
