YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT:
IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING!",1224028800,2,134,3.8214285714285716

8306026,5,B001GLZR14,"He sings catchy songs, moves like Jagger, has decent vocals, good looks and enough energy to have you bouncing off the walls. I loved this concert and can't wait for Mika to tour here in the US so I can be there!",1354924800,,212,4.071428571428571
8306027,5,B001GLZR14,"I got the package couple of days later after the date anticipated by the Amazon, but earlier then i thought originally. Anyhow because was considered late I've got some money back for the shipment. I had a chat with Hari, from Amazon-chat. Very nice and helpful!

I love the concert with all the preparations, work, energy, etc...that was invested in. I love also the second part with the documentary about making of it... then how serious was he cooking :0),  ... the moulding for his custom made shoes, etc...
I'll watch it for sure again!

Talking about it feels like a pleonasm like i would say ""the sun is hot""...:0)

If you are Mika's fan, what are you waiting for???
It is the best piece of ""how his life is like"" that you can get in a visual form.

I love the way how...  the second part stopped exactly in the point were the first part started ( when he enter the scene with his signature-jump by now! cool !!)

The costumer service from Amazon excellent. Thanks!",1317686400,,972,4.4576271186440675
8306028,5,B001GLZR14,"The product arrived at home, it was new, as they published at Amazon and it works just fine.
  :D",1305331200,,97,4.052631578947368
8306029,5,B001GLZR14,He is just great and the DVD shows what an artist can do on the stage. The bonus are great since we learn how much work work and imagination were involved in this brilliant performance.,1290211200,,185,4.314285714285714
8306030,5,B001GLZR14,"This boy is AMAZING!! He can really sing! His performances are beautiful and so different from what you usually see. I LOVE that he has a theme for this show! It's mostly in French his speaking stuff to the audience, well, cuz he's in France. I can see why they love him over there! It comes with a documentary on the show, which is fun to watch. Mika seems like such a laidback person. You can see his personality in this and he's just so awesome! I would LOVE to meet him! This is definitely a GREAT DVD for anyone who likes live performances,but can't see em in concert!",1275609600,,573,4.26605504587156
8306031,3,B001GLZR14,"I was very impressed by Mika's previous DVD. The sound was excellent and the energy from the crowd enhanced the dvd experience. The video aspect was somewhat dark throughout and was the only negative I can apply to the last dvd. This effort offers nothing over his first dvd other than a better visual experience from a lighting point of view. At the same time, the crowd is marginally involved. Mika is left screaming at them to participate and show enthusiasm to a point where it distracts from the show. The songs are virtually the same though it is without a fun cover of a Jackson Five tune compared to the first dvd and the sound is not improved.
Unless you must have every Mika dvd, I can't recommend investing in this dvd if you already have the first as the performance watered down by an uninvolved crowd and no new music is offered.",1231545600,8,843,4.48051948051948
8306032,5,B001GLZR14,"On July 4, I stood in line outside Parc des Princes for 3 hours before the start of the show. I made the trip to Paris mostly to see Mika's first stadium performance. Once I stood in the coveted front-row center place, I knew I was in for a treat. This was my third Mika show, and I knew what to expect.
The decorations were second to none - the whole stage was a clown head! Each song had the support of a full-blown circus act - acrobats, clowns, orchestra, dancers, outrageous costumes, Chinese dragons, you name it!
Mika's performance was sublime as ever - you have to see they guy live to appreciate his amazing talent. The music is fantastic, we all know that.
Still, the best part of the show was the atmosphere - the 50,000 people stadium felt very intimate, with everyone singing along to every line, and Mika really created a very familiar atmosphere and gave the audience every imaginable treat. He is a superb performer and will only get better.
After two very successful years, this show was arguably the highlight of it all! Well done, Mika, and thanks for signing my ticket afterward!",1229385600,11,1099,4.527638190954774
8306033,5,B001GLZR14,If you like music and are alive today you will want this! Seeing the stage set alone is worth the price plus people who were there say they were in tears it was so good. I will have it just like the first one.,1224547200,3,209,3.772727272727273
