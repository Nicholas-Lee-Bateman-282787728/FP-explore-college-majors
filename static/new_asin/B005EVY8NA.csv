4667775,5,B005EVY8NA,"Ok no tv show is perfect and remember The Bionic Woman was not supposed to be a tv series. The fact that it lasted as long as it did and got one more year on another network The Bionic Woman was Luckier than most series. It's a fact that the ABC years had the strongest episodes written for the series. The Crossover episodes were definitely missed and the reason for such drastic Bionic Woman story changes. What does not make sense even though the Bionic Woman shifted to NBC why was it ok for Rudy and Oscar to appear on both networks and not Lee. However they decided to split the bionic duo Lindsay finds another Boyfriend in the guise of Christopher Stone as agent and now boyfriend Chris Williams for the last few episodes. Meanwhile Steve has a lot of slutty relations ships with guest actress's like Jenny Agutter and Suzanne Sommers. The first four episodes of season three are full of action and bionics's like we expect to see. But as the season drug on without series creator Kenneth Johnson and Harve Bennett as executioner producer the shows action went way down. First thing too much emphasis on Maximillion the two most boring episodes of this season is MAX and the Antidote. Both star the Bionic dog with very bad bionic sequences while Jamie is Missing throughout the entire episode. I want to see Jaime not Max. Obviously James D Parriot was expecting Maximillion to carry his own spin off series.
God I just saw The Deadly Music about the shark control Jaime did nothing bionic until 25 minutes into the episode really slow episode. Next flaw did anyone notice Jaime is never shown as a schoolteacher anymore. My favorite thing about the first two ABC seasons were the classroom sequences and how we wished we had a teacher like Jaime Sommers. Plus Jaime's jumping sequences got to be almost non existent in the later episodes there are at least six episodes with no jumps. And they were getting sloppy with Jaime's hair flying backward instead of hair netted or sprayed so it would not flip up when the stunt woman jumped backwards. However a victim of its time UFO's movies and stories were popular making Jaime meets a new extraterrestrial every week. I really like the Pyramid and Sanctuary Earth both are entertaining and have a little more time spent on these story's, the Martians are Coming, etc was a hoax so that doesn't count. Nice to see Jennifer Darlings character as Oscar Goldman's secretary on the  Six Million Dollar man defects totally to the Bionic Woman series becoming Jaime Sommers best friend , this definitely helped add some continuity to the series. The last change other than the Bionic Dog is we never see Jim or Helen Elgin ever. I kind a missed their nosiness into Jaime's life. There is one mention of Steve in the Bionic Woman's third season episode the Bionic Dog Rudy tells Jaime except for Jaime's ear and Steve's eye everything was tested on Max first. Last thing that bugs me is why they did not let the Bionic Dog appear or be mentioned on the Six Million Dollar Man. Even with such major changes we are still glad to have 22 more episodes of the series thanks to NBC otherwise the Bionic Woman would only have 36 episodes instead of 58. Lindsay Wagner's wonderful acting helps even some of the slow episodes. I am so glad all three season are out now if only Universal would fix Part 2 of the Return of Bigfoot sound track all would be perfect. The Six Million Dollar Man set has part two of that episode really muffled (I was so disappointed) and the Bionic Woman's second season release of the same episode is a little better but still sounds muffled. Joe Harnell who composed that soundtrack specially for that episode must be turning over in his grave. This release had no problems great color and sound  they did a  wonderful job remastering these episodes and they kept all the opening tags before the credits too.",1317859200,4,3880,4.612156295224312
4667776,5,B005EVY8NA,"I've been looking forward to when I could order Season 3 for months.  I made the order yesterday, planning for 2-day delivery (estimated for October 6); instead, Season 3 arrived today, the very day of Amazon's initial release!

Of course, all of the episodes look & sound as great as they did on their original '70s TV release; I've viewed 7 episodes over 2 discs just this afternoon, & look forward to the rest for a long time to come.  The Lindsay Wagner interview & other extras are also terrific.

Also, a compliment to both Amazon & Universal for completing and delivering the entire SERIES in just less than a year (certainly less time than the decades Universal made us wait for any of the ""Bionic Shows"" to even get on video or DVD).  Now I'll look forward to them delivering Six Million Dollar Man & the other Bionic Movies to Region 1 DVDs!",1317686400,8,851,4.5
4667777,4,B005EVY8NA,"After All Not all Seasons are great but for a Tv show like this one to be created and Try really hard to come up with some fun stuff, I am going to give credit to all who made this Tv Show, The Writers, The Actors, The stunt people, and so much more. You see with out Some Talent and some love for the show of course some of the cast will leave. Some of the Writers will leave and so many more would leave. For Lindsey to come out and to do another Season is good enough for me.
I have seen so many great shows run there course, they go so far beyond the time they should be on the Air. Sure Six Million Dollar Man did Run it's Course, Look at what Lee Majors Did for The Fall Guy. I don't See many sets for that show coming out. Why?
Well here is a good reason the people who make these dvds or company's look it at as a bigger picture. Oh they say lets put out the first Season and see how it Sells, and if it does not oh well then lets wait another year or more.
Look at shows like Hart to Hart, I don't see Season 3 coming out why come on guys or who ever is in charge man up and bring more seasons out. Then you can say oh lets reduce the price or take it way again.
Another show C.H.I.P.S what a graet show i don't see another season coming out at all.
How long do all we have to wait for seasons to come out tell us oh great companies???
Look at a Great show Hawaii Five O, Wow almost 12 seasons are out hmmmm.
Then they keep remaking these shows again,
Now we see a new Hawaii five O, Oh BOOOO,
Charlies Angels the original yes, The remake BOOOO
Bionic women Remake BOOO.
What next, Oh blue Ray oh boy.
Well nothing against anyone but come on already. Bring the shows back.
We are all great Fans and we like to see the shows we loved to watch, if it was when we were growing up, or watching it again on Tv, really bring them all back.
If you can put out all 12 Seasons of Hawaii Five O, Then Bring our Show back to Life onto dvd, Not Blue Ray,
Good luck to all.",1317686400,2,1969,3.8402948402948405
4667778,3,B005EVY8NA,"The only thing to recommend Season three of Bionic Woman I'm afraid is the Bionic Dog Maxamillion.  It goes down hill from there.  I think the loss of Kenneth Johnson, as well as Harve Bennett on Six Mill, plus no more crossovers makes the final season of Bionic Woman and the fifth season of Six Mill lose steam.  As a true fan of both shows however, I still feel these two shows were the best on TV, and I feel very fortunate to have grown up when they were real heroes on TV like Steve and Jaime.  I feel sorry for the kids today with only smut and violence to watch now a days.",1317168000,9,581,4.0701754385964914
4667779,5,B005EVY8NA,"Boy! Universal is really pumping out these seasons quickly *finally* (oxymoron)!

I LOVE this show. Out of ALL three seasons; if I had to put them in order it would be:

Season 2 (fav) - Even though I bought the NTSC version of this, I just ordered the PAL version as well because those transfers are great.

Season 3 (second fav) - simply because this season contained more ""favorite episodes"" for me than season one did, even though this season has some ""not so good"" ones as well.

Season 1 (least fav, but still loved it)

Can't wait to own this :)

After viewing these I can say that this season has the BEST transfers. Colors are great and sound is really good! Much happier with the quality of this season than season two. Unfortunately, this season seems to be most people's least favorite.",1312329600,5,798,4.506944444444445
4667780,5,B005EVY8NA,"""Bionic Woman"" fans of fans of Lindsay Wagners can rejoice in the fact that the last and final season of ""The Bionic Woman"" will be made available for purchase on October 4, 2011. This means all 58 episodes will finally be made available for people to enjoy for posterity to watch time and time again.

 In this 5 disc set all season 3 episodes (22 in all) are featured uncut in their original network full screen presentation.  English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo Sound is included along with English subtitles. Guest stars include Oscar winner Helen Hunt, Evel Knievel, Christopher Knight (of ""Brady Bunch"" fame), and Keenan Wynn.

 This season ran on the NBC television network from September, 1977 until May, 1978 when the series was ubruptly cancelled which led to an outcry from fans as the show was still doing well in the Nielsens. ""The Bionic Woman"" holds the distinction as being one of only a handful of network shows to be cancelled twice during its original run as the series was axed by ABC in the spring of 1977 while still a Top 20 rated show then picked up by NBC for a fall premiere. Many believe the reason ""The Bionic Woman"" didn't do as well ratings wise while on NBC was due to its terrible timeslot: Saturday nights at 8:pm, highly considered a ""death timeslot"" for television programming.

 Because ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" was still running on ABC in the 1977-1978 season and ""The Bionic Woman"" was airing on another network crossover episodes between Jamie and Steve Austin ceased. Instead a new love interest was given to Jamie: a man named Chris Williams played by Christopher Stone.

 Extras include a question and answer session with Lindsay Wagner, episode commentary on the Bionic Dog, and more!

4667914,1,B005EVY8NA,"I saw this show as a kid. I bought this DVD set for nostalgia, and I pretty much enjoy it. Were I rating the show, I'd give it a qualified 4 stars -- but I'm mostly rating the DVDs.

As far as the show goes, it's a lot dumber and cheaper than I remember. But I think people who grew up on it, and loved it as a child or teen, will enjoy it today. I don't think newcomers will like it that much. But that's true of many shows, I suppose.

Some of the dialog and incidents I still remember, some 35 years later. It's interesting how much cheaper the show looks in retrospect. For instance, in one episode Jamie is in East Germany. She's being chased by a helicopter, firing machine guns at her. No guns are visible in the helicopter, but then we cut to a scene inside the copter, and it's obviously Vietnam War footage. You can see the rice paddies underneath the machine gun. We cut back to Jamie's car, and again, no guns are visible in the copter. And no rice paddies on the ground -- just what looks like southern California. Who'd of thought that East Germany had California like terrain, with rice paddies to boot!

There are tons of cheap mistakes and fakeries like that, but that's no big deal. The show is still stupid fun, much like the original Star Trek. You don't watch a show like The Bionic Woman for realism.

My big complaint is the shoddy DVD manufacturing. The ""Long Live the King"" episode on Disc 5 keeps freezing and skipping. I'm using a new DVD player (less than a month old), I cleaned it, I cleaned the DVD, yet it still freezes and skips.

Hollywood always says, hey, no big deal. Just exchange it. But it's been a while since I bought it. I don't buy a TV series and then quickly watch every episode to check for mistakes. I watch an episode every now and then. By the time I get to Disc 5, it's been a while since I bought it.

I'm also disappointed the studio felt the need to hire a marketer to do FAKE reviews. There are many FAKE 5-star ""reviews"" for this DVD. You can spot them. They're usually just ONE WORD or a HANDFUL of words. They say nothing much about the product. And when you click to learn about the reviewer, you'll find that they posted 20 to 60 5-star ""reviews"" all on the same day.

Craigslist is full of ads seeking fake reviewers for Amazon and Yelp. I've also spotted a ton of fake reviews for Bates Motel and American Horror Story. Amazon should do a better job policing these fake reviewers.

Bottom line, The Bionic Woman is good stupid fun, with a dose of warm nostalgia, for people who grew up with this show. Lindsay Wagner is lovely. But DAMN I wish manufacturers did a better job at the factory. These shows aren't cheap, and a DVD shouldn't freeze and skip the first time you watch it.",1416960000,3,2743,4.281853281853282

4667993,4,B005EVY8NA,"Nostalgia has its appeal.  German Sheppard dogs have their appeal; Lindsey Wagner certainly has her appeal.  Even though there are glaring errors with special effects, production continuity, and awkward language, THE BIONIC WOMAN, SEASON THREE still entertains.  Much has been made in the Six Million Dollar world about the fact that this one season was highly unusual since the show had been dropped by ABC and picked-up by NBC.  Even without Steve Austin around, Jamie Sommers can be a great deal of fun to watch--especially, if you grew up watching her.  All the Max, the bionic dog, episodes are here--just a few, really, but the extras, including an extended 2010 interview with Lindsey Wagner and a couple of director commentary audio-tracks, are particularly interesting to aging fans, like myself.

A lot of highly dated sci-fi, more schmaltz and cheese than other shows in this genre, but I'm glad to get another look at Jamie and Max running together and, though once broken, lifting each other up.",1384041600,,1008,5.042168674698795

I was disappointed when they Cancelled the Bionic Woman from her original TV Network.  Glad NBC picked her up once more.  She only had three seasons for these reasons and I think the show would have lasted longer if they had allowed it to remain on her Original Network Channel.

The Third Season is watchable, I still like the Bionic Dog epidsode and a few others.

4668052,3,B005EVY8NA,"As has been pointed out by other reviewers of this, the third and final season of ""The Bionic Woman"", the series switched to the NBC Network after ABC ""pulled the plug"" after Season Two...

Similar to my review on the 2nd Season, the stories on the whole are not that much different from the Six Million Dollar Man Episodes with some of them playing off very familiar themes.  Once again, however, the show is competitive with the SMDM simply because of the terrific Lindsay Wagner who carries it on her back (non-bionic part) throughout...

On the DVD Set, the 3rd Season starts strong with the two-part ""Bionic Dog"" saga of Max, the German Shepherd who became a semi-regular in the final season.  He also appears in various other episodes in extended cameos and a few more starring roles as well.  In the episode ""Max"", 70's Icon, Christopher Knight (Peter Brady from the Brady Bunch) has a lead role.  From there, the highlight of the series for me is the return of the Fembots in ""Fembots in Last Vegas"".  This is a two-part story as a follow-up to the three-part story from Season II, ""Kill Oscar"".  This time, the story is without Professor Franklin (played deliciously then by John Houseman) but with his Son attempting to take over the world with Fembots running amok in the City of Sin.  Ultimately, his son is revealed to be a robot as well!  Well-Known Actor from this time period, James Olsen (""The Andromeda Strain"") plays a key male lead role in this one as a very wealthy scientist whose ideas are being used for evil purposes by Franklin's son.  An interesting side story is that Olsen's character has to live in a ""plastic bubble"" as common germs will eventually kill him if he leaves his protected room (which he does have to leave thanks to a Fembot trashing of his domicile...)

The DVD ends on a strong note as well with the episode ""On the Run"" with a burned out Jaime trying to leave the OSI and because of her value and the government secrets she is privy to, this is not an easy task...  This episode also features a very sympathetic Oscar Goldman (played by Richard Anderson throughout the series) characteristics of which were much more prevalent in the BW Series than in the SMDM. This final episode also features an ongoing romantic interest that was added as part of Season Three.  There are some other good episodes such as ""Sanctuary Earth"" with a young Helen Hunt as an Alien Princess that Jaime befriends and protects during her time on Earth.  It is always interesting to see where such famous stars  got their starts and to notice in hindsight how they had a lot of potential from early on...

The only other thing to be said here it is obvious that they really tried to breathe some new life into the series in its final year with albeit mixed results.  Nonetheless, it is an important and necessary addition to the ""Bionic"" TV/Film Library",1356739200,2,2877,4.607843137254902

4668072,5,B005EVY8NA,"First, three things had occured with The Boionic Woman; Season 3.

One was that sadly, ABC had dropped the show from it's 1977 fall line-up. The second one was that happily, NBC decided to carry the show's final season.

But unlike in the first two seasons of the show, Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner used to do crossover episodes between The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman. Sadly, when the Bionic Woman was picked up by NBC for it's third and last season, Majors and Wagner had stopped doing crosover episodes between the two shows. Mainly because both stars' shows were on different networks. Today, it might have been different if both shows wre still in production.

But nevertheless, The Bionic Woman still proved to be extraordinary and explosive in its third season!! And the offering of the third season on DVD also marks the completion of the three box-set collections of the show, comprising of all 14 discs covering all 55 episodes of the show!!

But in THIS set, Jamie gets a great deal of assignments from Oscar Goldman and the OSI (Operations of Scientific Investigations). Almost like the FBI!

Probably the 2 most action-packed episodes are the first two;

She learns in a 2-part episode about a German Shepherd named Max, who is suffering from the same life-threatening problems that she and Col. Steve Austin went through when they both had their near-tragic accidents, and in her effort to try to help save the dog from certain death, she has him rebuilt with bionic limbs, which gives him the same bionic powers as herself and Steve! He has a slight advantage over Jamie and Steve though, because he can run up to 90mph!! So naturally, he gets paired with Jamie and they BOTH as a team overpower and squelch the bad guys!!

In another two-part episode, Jamie is in Las Vegas and she faces what might be the worst of her fears in life coming true! While in a vault with Oscar and looking at some old outdated equipment there, they discover one of the old fembots there that were put out of comission and is no longer a threat to them. Or so they thought! Jamie has a quick flashback. In it, she visions what she went through before when the robots invaded her apartment and the shocking accident she has while trying to escape her apartment and the robots! She imediately wants to get out of there!

But one of the fembots whom she and Steve had fought with before, has come back to life, setting off another ferocious battle between man and beast, err, cyborg and robot. She finds out that her fromer advisary, Dr. Franklin who was sentensed to life in prison and had died there for extortion and unlawfully producing look-alike robots, has a son who wants to try to continue his work by launching and powering a space satilite that has a powerful laser beam that can destroy cities and buildings!! Oscar and Rudy Wells are again kidnapped and held for ransom money.

But still, the other episodes also prove to be more action-packed as well!! The episodes go in order on each disc as follows;

Disc 1;

1. The Bionic Dog (pt. 1).
  The Bionic Dog (pt. 2).

2. Fembots in Las Vegas (pt. 1).
  Fembots in Las Vegas (pt. 2).

Disc 2;

3. Rodeo.
4. African Connection.
5. Motorcycle Boogie.
6. Brain Wash.

Disc 3;

7. Escape to Love.
8. Max.
9. Over the Hill Spy.
10. All for One.

Disc 4;

11. The Pyramid'
12. The Antidote.
13. The martians are Coming, The Martians are Coming.
14. Sanctuary Earth.
15. Deadly Music.

Disc 5;

16. Which One Is Jamie?.
17. Out of Body.
18. Long Live the King.
19. Rancho Outcast.
20. On the Run.

The last episode is Jamie's being terrified, wanting to retire from the OSI so that she can lead a life of her own. But Oscar fears that she might become a risk of being kidnapped because her bionics are government property and also that she knows too much confidential info.

All in all, the show stood the test of time, even having lasted for three seasons. The Six Million Dollar Man went to five seasons. I began buying THAT show on DVD as well, but Seasons 3 and 4 are the hardest ones to get anywhere on the Web!! I'm not about to buy the 40-disc 100-episode box set!!! Even if those 2 seasons are used, I'd like to get them, still!!

If anyone knows where I can get these two seasons of the Six Million Dolar Man, could you please let me know? For now, I'll continue watching The Bionic Woman on DVD. Hopefully Amazon will restock these two items for sale again.

As for The Bionic Woman, anyone wishing to buy all three seasons should do so because you never know when they might run out of them!!

4668094,5,B005EVY8NA,"I was very displeased with the deplorable attention Universal gave to the DVD release of The Bionic Woman. The studio seems determined to utilize no common sense and no sense of quality in its releases. The reason for the season 2 debacle was due to the complete lack of quality control. Rest assured they were not aware of the 9 minutes of missing dialogue on ""Deadly Ringer"" because they did not review it. They initially tried to cover it up with some silly statement about older source material. I had better source material on old VHS tapes than they had. The bottom line is they did not try and they didn't care and they got caught once again being disingenuous with customers. This release gets five stars based on the fact the Universal didn't let themselves get caught with their pants down again. Sound and picture quality are better than season one which would get about a four and FAR better than season 2 which would get zero stars.",1322438400,7,945,4.597633136094674

I was just a kid back then. But when I watch this it all was so obvious and glaring. No wonder they got at you when you were young. But despite all of the beginnings of PC I couldn't get over Oscar calling Jaime ""babe"" every other sentence. But then again I did say it was the BEGINNING of the PC bs.",1322352000,4,460,3.904255319148936
4668096,4,B005EVY8NA,"This 1977-78 Season of THE BIONIC WOMAN was the season this show was moved from ABC to NBC which unfortunately resulted in a sharp drop in ratings and its cancellation in the Spring of 1978 when THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN was also given the boot, which was probably due to the fact that this season and the 5th Season of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN had no more crossover episodes with THE 6 MILLION DOLLAR MAN, which was probably due to the fact that THE BIONIC WOMAN & THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN were no longer on the same network as opposed to the first 2 seasons of THE BIONIC WOMAN and Universal wanted to see if this show could truly survive on its own, but obviously it didn't.

Therefore, there were no more episodes with Steve Austin(Lee Majors)anymore either, which really sucked since not having the Bionic duo anymore was kind of like the police drama T.J. HOOKER without short-tempered rookie Officer Vince Romano(Adrian Zmed).

Additionally; in this 1977-1978 Season Jaime Sommers(Lindsey Wagner)was not a teacher anymore since she was too busy with OSI assignments, but you could tell in this season that the show was dying and that THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN was runing out of steam, plus it seemed as if both Jaime and Steve were getting tired too.

This 1977-1978 Season also had some interesting guest stars like
*Evel Knievel doing a cameo appearance in the ""Motorcycle Boogie"" episode

*John Houseman in the ""Fembots in Las Vegas"" episode before his co-starring days as Edward Stratton II on SILVER SPOONS

*John Crawford in the ""Rodeo"" episode before his co-starring days on the short-lived POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR

*Jeannie Wilson in the ""Fembots in Las Vegas"" episode before her co-starring days as Janet Fowler on SIMON & SIMON and as Rita on the short-lived supercycle series STREET HAWK

*Raymond St. Jacques in the ""African Connection"" episode before his co-starring days on the short-lived SUPERIOR COURT

*John Reilly in the episodes ""Long Live The King"" and ""Escape To Love"" before his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN and ONE-LIFE-TO-LIVE

*Spencer Milligan in the ""Motorcycle Boogie"" episode after his co-starring days as Will on LAND OF THE LOST

*Peter Mark Richman in the ""Escape To Love"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

*Christopher Knight in the ""Max"" episode after his co-starring days as Peter Brady on THE BRADY BUNCH

*Branscombe Richmond in ""The Pyramid"" episode before his co-starring days as Bobby Sixkiller on RENEGADE

*Helen Hunt in the ""Sanctuary Earth"" episode before she was a star and before her co-starring days on the sitcom MAD ABOUT YOU

*Henry Darrow in the ""Deadly Music"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL and SANTA BARBARA

*James Sikking in the ""Which One Is Jaime"" episode before his co-starring days as Lt. Howard Hunter on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES",1321920000,10,2864,4.912863070539419
4668097,5,B005EVY8NA,"This was the final season of ""The Bionic Woman"" Lindsey Wagner played Jaime Sommers and was terrific in the part. Another good sci fi series that is fondly remembered. There was a remake of this series not too long ago. A big mistake. Lindsay Wagner brought warmth to the role and she is the only one who could play the part. You actually feel for the character. If a character isn't likeable the show cannot work and will fail. When I first heard about this series I was sceptical. But this series was action-packed just like ""The Six Million Dollar Man"".A really fine show.",1321747200,16,575,4.538461538461538
4668098,4,B005EVY8NA,"I agree with everyone, or at least those who left positive things to say about this series. Many have brought out the points that there were no crossover episodes in season 3 (or season 5 of SMDM) The reason for this, as someone pointed out, was that the show appeared on a different network, and also it was felt that there had been so many already, they, the network and Universal, wanted to see if the show could truly survive on its owm. Someone else mentioned that Jaime was not portrayed as  a school teacher anymore. In this season, she was too busy with assignments for that. Lastly, this was the only season where they used teasers instead of starting the show with a prologue to to the show. Some of the intros were the original ones, For episode 5 and 22, they had to use the ""Next on Bionic Woman"" featuring Lindsay Wagner, versions from the end of previous episodes network runs.  I wish other shows would have done this as often times the episode teaser is different from the one they use to promote the next episode of the series before the end credits. (i.e. Battlestar Galactica scenes for next week often differed from the teaser before the episode previewed)",1321401600,2,1177,4.547169811320755
4668099,3,B005EVY8NA,"As a child, I watched both The Six Million Dollar Man and its spinoff, The Bionic Woman, but quickly became more enthusiastic about the latter. While I was entertained by Steve Austin's derring-do, I cared about Jaime Sommers.  However, by the time the final seasons of TBW and 6M$M came along, my interest in each series had declined.  So with a few exceptions, I am seeing these episodes for the first time.  With the exception of a few episodes, including The Bionic Dog and On the Run, season 3 is a bit of a letdown.

Much of the success of TBW must be credited to Lindsay Wagner. She brings a combination of charm and intelligence unseen on television since Elizabeth Montgomery's turn in Bewitched - adding hints of sadness and vulnerability. As the series progresses, Sommers matures and becomes more confident.  Richard Anderson brings a fatherly quality to Oscar Goldman - a contrast with his more hard-nosed portrayal in 6M$M. These qualities were utterly lacking in the unmemorable and mercifully short lived 2007 remake.

Producer Kenneth Johnson's involvement in TBW was ended in season 3, and that may be why many of the episodes are flat, paint-by-number affairs.  The ""insider"" references seen in the first two seasons are largely missing - although there are a few pointed moments, such as when Oscar chides a Senator for mispronouncing Jaime's name. Jaime's work as a forward-thinking teacher is mentioned, but never seen. In some ways, this reminds me of the third season of the original Star Trek, where a new producer altered the tone of the series in a negative way.  There is the usual recycling of plot elements, such as the Fembots in Las Vegas episode, which ends with an interesting twist.

Since TBW was moved from ABC to NBC for season 3, there are no crossover episodes with 6M$M.  There are a few interesting guest stars including Evel Knievel (as himself), Brock Peters, and a very young Helen Hunt.  My favorite semi-regular is Bracken (along with several stunt dogs) as Max, the bionic bog. The visual style is in keeping with the Universal Television look of the 1970s: simple camera setups, with establishing shots transitioning to two-shots and close-ups, very little camera movement beyond the occasional pan or zoom, and numerous stock footage. After the hand-held camera style of today's series, this simplicity is a welcome relief.

Both picture and audio quality are improved over previous seasons, although there few seconds of muffled sound effects in Sanctuary Earth.  The sound is two channel mono, and high-end frequency response is improved over the first two seasons, with clearer dialogue.

The bonus features include episode commentary with writers James D. Parriott and Steven E. De Souza, a Q&A with Lindsay Wagner, and a photo gallery.",1321228800,24,2790,4.997840172786177
4668100,5,B005EVY8NA,"The 3rd and final season of Bionic Woman is an excellent blast from the past. Shown on NBC from Sept. 1977 to May 1978 consisting of 22 episodes. Jaime Sommers is a resident of Ojai,Ca.,schoolteacher and a member of the OSI(Office of Scientific Investigations).This season Jaime get a bionic german shepard,yes a bionic dog and a new love interest since Steve Austin is still on the ABC network,which means no more crossovers. Still if you grew up in the 70's watching the series,this a must have dvd set. NOTE:Between 1987-1994,there was 3 made for tv reunion movies.
