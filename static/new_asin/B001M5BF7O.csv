8382782,3,B001M5BF7O,"""Passionate Deceptions"" is your typical soft-core erotic thriller, especially from MRG Entertainment which by and large sucks. It doesn't go beyond the norm like the old Mystique Films did from Playboy's storehouse of late-night fare; instead it IS the norm (really the norm from around 10 years before this was produced). The sex scenes are above average taken on their own merits, but they lose luster when you factor in the nearly-complete lack of explicit nudity, and most disappointing, the unattractive actresses. Well, maybe ""unattractive"" is a bit harsh, but these definitely are not the A-listers. I mean Tamara Landry is the top cat, and she looks like she has spent more time in the office of Dr. 90210 than of the office of any casting director.

Could have been so much better with soft-core Hall of Famers, like Tracy Ryan, Renee Rea, Shannon Whirry...heck, even Maria Ford.",1332720000,,888,5.0
