8585157,5,B00CQRNM64,"I love The Alfred Hitchcock Hour-Season 3's ""Where the Woodbine Twineth.""  It's a very good movie that I would watch everytime it came on TV, but could never find it online.  Now I have it.  It's not a Region 1 Movie (U.S. & Canada), so you'll have to purchase a multi-region DVD player that plays U.S./Canada + additional regions.",1518566400,,331,4.576271186440678

8585162,5,B00CQRNM64,"At the top of the page, this set is listed as ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour: Season 3 [Region 4]"".....I live in the USA and normally region 4 discs will not play in a USA player, as USA players are Region 1.....but i bought this set simply because it is the only official Hitchcock Hour release that contains my favorite episode, ""Where the Woodbine Twineth"" in existence to date....I put one of the discs in my region 1 bluray player and, to my amazement, it plays perfectly!.....so the Region 4 info must be a mistake....this set appears to be region-free........I don't look for this set to be released in the USA any time soon simply because this show ran for over a decade and ""Where the Woodbine Twineth"" was one of the very last episodes produced before the show was canceled......i don't think they have gotten anywhere close to releasing this season of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.....anyway, so far the episodes have been superb.....my only complaint is, on a scale of 1 - 10, i would rate the transfer as probably a 9 because the bottom edge of the screen shows a slight ""jitter""....if it weren't for that, the quality would be perfect",1473120000,10,1141,4.653465346534653
8585163,4,B00CQRNM64,"The availability of these old one-hour programs has been spotty, unlike the half-hour Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The region code of this set is definitely an obstacle between the Hitchcock fan and many hours of enjoyment. Since I have no problem playing PAL DVDs, I decided to take a chance on this set. You can reset your PC to Region 4, but you are limited to 4 or 5 region resets by the system. If you have more than one PC, no problem. Just leave one set to Region 4. However, region-free DVD players are reasonably priced right here on Amazon, so I will probably add one of those to my player collection.
The film to video transfer is first-rate, as good as any I have seen. I will definitely purchase Seasons 1 and 2 as well.",1468800000,3,731,4.382352941176471
8585164,5,B00CQRNM64,"Easily the best season of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. The Fabulous Company Edition (Region 2) plays on my standard American Laptop blueray player using VLC Media Freeware. You don't need to convert the region of your Bluray player to get them to work. Some media players will try to get you to change the region of the player (A limited number of times), The editions from other manufacturers like Madmen need to be converted to ISO files (Using a media converter, some of which are freeware) to play on a computer first.

The transfer quality is not quite that good, and the sound is a little more washed out than Madman's Editions. Definitely worth buying due to its ease of playing in a market that has been kept from obtaining the later Alfred Hitchcock Seasons.",1466640000,2,765,4.666666666666667
