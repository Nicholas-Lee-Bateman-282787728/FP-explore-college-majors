8421214,4,B004AYM95G,"Dostojevskij was perhaps the worlds greatest novelwriter, and I have loved him since my youth. This collection of russian dvd's is the ansvar to my dreams about having the opportunity to se some of the great novels on film. And I must say about ""Karamasow"" and ""the idiot"" that these are wonderfull. They are very detailed as any Dostojevskij adict wants it. Brillant acting.
But such long movies needs several dvd's to make the video quality better. At least it takes a high quality dvd player to make it work right.
The image quality is OK, but the tracking is tough! If Your dvd equipment is of minor quality, You might get dissapointed.
The ""insulted and injured"" - well - it doesn't reach the level of the two others, but anyway - all in all a phantastic bargain!",1426032000,5,768,4.572463768115942
8421215,4,B004AYM95G,If you love books and regret all the movies that didn't include every little detail from the book then you need to watch a Russian movie about their own books. They do it right but pack a lunch......,1407283200,16,199,4.2631578947368425
8421216,4,B004AYM95G,"Excellent series of 3 of the best novels written by F M Dostoyevsky.
Too bad the english subtitles are bad : bad spelling or sometimes wrong translation ; in a few episodes of IDIOT, in rapid dialog subtitles are too late.
But if you are looking for a ""close to the novel"" film, this is it.
In my opinion only Russians can adapt Russian novels properly.",1342569600,25,353,4.363636363636363
