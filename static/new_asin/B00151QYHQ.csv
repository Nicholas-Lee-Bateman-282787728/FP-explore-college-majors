8257040,5,B00151QYHQ,"I first came across this in my search for yuri shoujo-ai anime on you tube,but found it difficult to access english dubbed or subtitled episodes after volume one. One disk comes in a very nice sturdy case.(if unfamiliar with Strawberry Panic)It takes place in an all girls school,the school itself is broken up into three distinctivly different schools with different uniforms and panels of popular/powerful students. Lots of longing looks and passionate embraces and several actual scenes of girl on girl love but not gratuitous or hentai. It follows smoothly after volume one where you get a sense of the charaters. Now they are fully themselves the relationships are more fleshed out. You can definately tell whos a villian and whos not. I really enjoy the way the charaters evolution into loving each other takes place .The struggle with but acceptance and on some level expectance of theses girls to be together. The subtitling is great and seems from the video action pretty accurate. The music is good and follows the action,I especially loved the opening song. I've since seen all the volumes/episodes of Strawberry Panic and this is my favorite. School life is portrayed mostly through activities and not actual classes. The school life between the emotional of the relatingships is a good balance.",1307404800,,1307,5.083720930232558
8257041,5,B00151QYHQ,"Strawberry Panic! volume 2 involves the continuing adventures of the girls on Astrea Hill, divided into three schools: Saint Miator, developing tomorrow's housewives with strict rules and tradition; St. Spica, focused on athletics and leadership; and St. Lu Lim (or Lilim or Lulim, depending on what translation you're looking at), the least intensive of the three with many clubs and fun activities to fill free time.

Each episode is a cute, stand-alone story involving things like trying to find a lost umbrella, studying for an exam, or going to the beach.  Underneath these stories, however, is a constant romantic tension: all of the girls are interested in other girls (in fact, not a single male appears at any point in the show!).

The main focus this DVD (and in the series) is St. Miator, which follows Nagisa Aoi, a cheerful 15-year-old and her romantic entanglements with her roomate Tamao and the beautiful Shizuma, an older and very amorous school star.  However, one episode moves us over to St. Spica, where our main character Hikaru Konohana and her ""prince"" Amane Otori (pictured on the box cover) are trying to overcome their shyness enough to start a relationship.  Not all the girls at St. Spica are very nice, however, and Hikaru quickly finds herself the target of a very nasty predator.

Strawberry Panic! is unusual: it's a show aimed at adult men written by a woman focusing on adolescent lesbianism.  The sexuality, therefore, though written to appeal to men, still has a definite female point of view in parts.  Still, a lot of the more blatant sex in the manga and novels was cut out.  If you're looking for racy material, you'd do better to check out Strawberry Panic! books.

Strawberry Panic! is cute, fun and full of likeable characters and constant soap-opera entanglements.  If that's not your thing, I definitely advise you to stay away.  But if you enjoy shoujo ai (""girl's love""--that is, lesbian elements), cute adolescent love stories and/or simple, funny plotlines, this is definitely one to check out.",1216944000,,2044,4.979411764705882
8257042,3,B00151QYHQ,"You really can't blame anyone if they decide that this series is not their cup of tea. While it may be a yuri story about young, nubile, Catholic school girls being angsty and dramatic with each other... it's a very DRY yuri story. Those who enjoy the easy going drama stories that focus more on the relationships between the characters and things like working on how they feel will find enjoyable viewing here. If you're someone who desperately needs their conflicts to involve some kind of external catalyst to keep things moving, this series will probably bore you to tears. Definitely for the niche audience who seeks out this kind of storytelling.",1216857600,,652,4.830357142857143
8257043,5,B00151QYHQ,"I love Strawberry Panic! It really deserves every ""yuri"" tag that it gets, because this is quality. Tasteful girl-girl romance. No crude fanservice. Characters (all female) fall in love just like anyone else. Two girls being romantically involved is not treated like something out of the ordinary. In fact, on Astraea Hill, its expected!

This volume contines where volume 1 left off. I'll try not to spoil anything... Hikari and Amane (cover) get a little closer despite Kaname and Monomi's devious shenanigans. Shizuma and Nagisa bond over French. There are a couple silly episodes on this disc, like the one with the umbrella (8). The one with the ""Seven Wonders"" (9) is a little silly too, but we get to see Miyuki and Shizuma as first years and that makes it worth it.

Overall, I think Strawberry Panic is a good series. The art style is kind of standard, but is well drawn and good quality on DVD. The plot is somewhat predictable, but still fun and charming. I love all the characters, especially Shizuma.

This volume contains episodes 7-11 with subtitles. I wish there was a dubbed version on disc. I don't watch dubbed versions because they are usually terrible, but sometimes its nice to hear their voices in English.

Oh, and be sure to get the next volume. Things really get good!

If you like the anime there is a manga and light novel as well.",1214179200,3,1359,4.69327731092437
