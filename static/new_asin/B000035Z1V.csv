I have been walking around with a scrap piece of paper in my pocket with the names: Innocence, Surprise, Becoming I and Becoming II on it for months.  How amazing!  And thank you  for creating them as a set! I have wanted these episodes forever!  Becoming II will break your heart in a million pieces.  This is a MUST  HAVE!  If you are not a Buffy fan, don't watch them, because you will be  hooked forever!
Now we need a video of the Buffy crossover to Angel  when they made love again and then had to forget it ever happened!  Another  gut-wrenching episode.

1260361,5,B000035Z1V,"The Buffy/Angel Chronicles set is a wondeful introduction to Buffy, but a wondeful collection for established fans. Joss Whedon has crafted along with Ty King (Passion) and Marti Noxon (I Only Have Eyes for You) some  perfectly exemplary and heart rendering entertainment.
The two parter of  Surprise and Innocence bring Buffy and Angel's relationship full circle  with love and trust. Only two have those two things wrenched from him by  way of Angel's true happines. This also brings forth a betrayel of a  trusted friend. Passion Amazing. This episode is as near to perfect as a  program be it small screen or big can get. Very emotional and beautifully  written and shot. I Only Have Eyes for You a ghost story that strangely  unites Buffy and Angel through poltergeists. The Becomings Amazing.  Amazing. Amazing with a daring twist ending, of which likes I've never  seen. Highly Reccomended.",947808000,11,897,5.040816326530612

1260376,5,B000035Z1V,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer is a brilliant show. This boxed set collection shows why. The Buffy/Angel relationship and story arc is one of the strongest,heartfelt, and brilliantly played out love affairs on television. The episodes on these videos are some of the strongest episodes to date. It's a perfect way to start. Actually, a set before this with the premiere episode is probably a smarter way to start. The love that Buffy and Angel have is incredible. When that love is taken away by Angel's curse at the end of ""Surprise"" and the episodes that followed show how evil he's become, you can't help but feel for Buffy and everyone involved. That's the genius of Buffy. It's story arcs and mythology is astonishing. These are real people. Well, some of them anyways. They have normal lives with normal everyday things happening in them. It just so happens they live on a hellmouth and Buffy is a vampire slayer. The demons, monsters, and story lines have always been deep, and always have an inner meaning. The actors bring it together in such a consistent brilliant way that it's almost heartbreaking that none of them, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar, get emmy nominations. The show is smart, clever, deep, intelligent, and one of the finest shows in the genre(or not)to hit T.V. It's a shame that there are detractors to such a brilliant show. Some people are turned off by the title. Oh well. People who know it know that this is a great show. Buy these videos!.",999129600,3,1469,4.764705882352941

1260380,5,B000035Z1V,"This boxed set features six highlight episodes from season two of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" are a double-header in which teen slayer Buffy turns seventeen and loses her virginity to her souled vampire boyfriend, Angel. Unfortunately, Angel's soul (the result of a Gypsy curse) is with him only on the condition that he never experience a moment of true happiness. A night with Buffy certainly fills that bill, turning him into a soulless, sadistic killer who sets his sights on Buffy and friends.
""Passion"" features the brutal death of technopagan/Gypsy Jenny Calendar, one of Buffy's teachers and her Watcher's sweetheart, at Angel's hands. ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" (the only non-pivotal episode in the set) is a ghost story which makes Buffy and Angel its star players. And the tearjerking two-part finale, ""Becoming"", has gone down in Buffy history as possibly the best episode ever -- Buffy has to team up with a former foe, the snarky vampire Spike, to send a re-souled Angel to hell in order to prevent an apocalypse.
Buffy is a great show, and the boxed set offers extras in the form of interviews with series creator Joss Whedon on each episode. Not only is this a must-buy for Buffy fans, it's also a worthwhile purchase for those looking to find what the fuss is all about.",990576000,5,1312,4.835555555555556
1260381,5,B000035Z1V,"The flippant and irreverent title deceives. Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" continually makes critics' lists of the Top Ten Shows on T.V., and these six episodes, with all of their five-star reviews, clearly illustrate why the show draws such critical praise. With its amazing acting, brilliant direction, and truly exceptional writing, ""Buffy"" simply is the best show on television.
The six episodes featured here follow Buffy and Angel's doomed relationship, which became the focal point of Season 2. He loses his soul after they consummate their love and reverts back to Angelus, intent on destroying Buffy and her friends and family. The season finale, ""Becoming, Parts 1 & 2"", may very well be the best two hours of television ever produced. This is definitive ""Buffy"" viewing.
Joss Whedon and Sarah Michelle Gellar deserve a mantle full of Emmys for their work, and it's evidence of Joss' genius that the show has maintained such a high standard of excellence over time. For those unfamiliar yet curious about ""Buffy"", I highly recommend viewing this set. You'll be hooked.",988416000,6,1088,5.1525423728813555
1260382,5,B000035Z1V,"This is the 2nd of 3 VHS 3-pack sets featuring episodes from the cult TV hit, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  This set concentrates on episodes from season 2, in which Buffy's relationship with Angel, the vampire with a soul, takes a tragic turn and sets in motion events that resound through the series even to the present time.  As always, Sarah Michelle Gellar is perfection as the title character.  David Boreanez does a solid job as well as Angel, especially when he turns evil.  And James Marsters is a stitch as the wild card vamp, Spike.  Many fans think this series of episodes is still the highlight of the series.  If you agree or not, there is no denying the intelligence and wit that creator Joss Whedon has lavished on this series.  If you get just one set, this probably would be the one.  Highly recommended.",982022400,3,819,4.561643835616438
1260383,5,B000035Z1V,"The underpinning to the first couple of seasons was the relationship between the Slayer, Buffy Summers and the vampire with a soul, Angel.  There was always a sexual tension between the two and on ""Surprise"", they finally consummated their relationship.  This turns out to be disastrous as with the act, Angel finds one true moment of happiness and he loses his soul. He is reverted back to former evil self and is intent on wrecking havoc on the world.  The guilt and feelings of betrayal that Sarah Michelle Gellar portrays in ""Innocence"" is acting at it's best.  The remaining episodes show the conflict between the two former lovers. David Boreanez's over the top performance of the evil Angel perfectly balances terror with mocking humor.  ""The Becoming"" (Parts 1 & 2) bring the situation to a surprising and tension filled conclusion.  The true gem amongst the episodes is ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" in which the spirits of a student and teacher who were involved in an affair at Sunnydale High School in the 1950's that turned into a murder-suicide start inhabiting the bodies of people at the school.  Eventually Buffy & Angel become possessed by the spirits and the episode is heartbreaking and pushes all the right buttons.",978912000,7,1233,4.8708133971291865
1260384,5,B000035Z1V,"Any self respecting Buffy fan has to own these tapes! The tragic love story between Slayer and Vampire comes to a head when Angel loses his soul, and becomes Buffy's worst enemy. The six episodes contained in this set are a treasure chest of Buffy lore, covering Angel's transformation and the death of a major Buffy character.
These episodes deal with the issues all teenagers face at some point in their lives; the decision to have sex, the consequences of that choice, the death of a loved one, the way people can change, and many more. Although they are placed in a supernatural context, the parallels can be drawn. I know one mother who used these episodes as a stepping stone to talking with her daughter about the dangers of pre-maritial sex.
For a long time my roommates laughed at my obsession with Buffy and Angel. That ended when I came home one night and found them watching the last few minutes of ""Becoming"" part 2. Tears were forming in their eyes as the credits roled, and they told me they finally understood why I said this was the best show on television.
A word of warning, this set will leave you wanting more. The last episode is a bit of a cliff hanger, and you'll want to track down a friend's season 3 tapes to get the conclusion!",975196800,22,1255,4.4847161572052405
1260394,5,B000035Z1V,"If you've been wondering why a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer can draw such raves and inspire such a loyal following, this three tape set will show you why. Featuring the six critical episodes from season two arc when Angel went to the dark side, this set of videos has all the hallmarks of Buffy--great acting, superb storytelling and gifted direction.
These episodes, which aired at about a year after the show started, proved that no one was safe in the show. From Angel's fall to the dark side (superbly acted by David Boreanaz, who shows a great deal of range) to Ms. Calendar's death to Buffy's being forced to send Angel to hell to save the world, this set of episodes show why Buffy is the most unpredictable and entertaining show on television today.
One nice thing about these tapes--Joss Whedon offers commentary at the end of the episode so as to not spoil them for you.
If you've not seen Buffy yet, start here.  If you've seen Buffy, you know these episodes are a must have.  Give them a try. I gurantee you won't regret it.",972259200,7,1044,4.518518518518518
1260395,5,B000035Z1V,"Joss Whedon did well with the 1992 original feature, but most of his stuff on the movie was taken out. He then decided to make a tv show out of it. People thought the show wouldn't make it. They were proved wrong with the show aired in March of 1997. Since then, the show has grown into something HUGE. And these 6 episodes on tape are a part of that. At best, they're one of the very reasons this show is so big. What is that reason? The tragic love story of the slayer, Buffy Summers, in love with a vampire with a soul, Angel. Although the storyline has grown and died since these 6 episodes, it is a good way to start it off. If I say more about this, I will go on and on. I have one more thing to say: You don't even have to be a fan of the show to watch this!",970876800,2,765,3.848101265822785
1260396,5,B000035Z1V,"Joss Whedon and company do themselves proud with what they've turned out here.  Season 2, in my opinion, is the strongest to date, particularly these 6 episodes.  Surprise/Innocence is the beginning of the emotional  rollercoaster ride between Buffy and Angel.  The emotion heightens during  Passion and I Only Have Eyes For You, and you will hear your heart break as  you reach for the Kleenex at the end of Becoming Part 2.
If you are not  already a fan of Buffy and company (and I'd like to know the reason why),  these strong episodes will reel you in hook, line and sinker.

It is two of the most well exectuted episodes in BtVS...oh and 'There was this whole thing with an arm in a box'...
Next we have two episodes depicting the death of Jennifer Calendar or Jhanna.  In an effort to kill of a loved one of Buffy's and keep the curse away Angel brutally slaughters Jenny in a Sunnydale Highschool hallway.  At the end of Passions we see Jenny's tombstone.  It doesn't read her actual name 'Jhanna'...it reads Jennifer Calendar.  She was forgiven, but she payed the price for her actions, in fact she payed too much.
And last, but certainly not least we have the two-part ending called ""Becoming""...Buffy finally confronts her ex-lover Angel in a sword-wielding duel.  After Jenny and Kendra's death, Buffy has no choice but to go after 'the fiend' that has hurt and killed the ones she loved.  I won't spoil the ending, because most of you know what happens and to those who don't need a little surprise in their life ;)...These six episodes are a must for any fan and can suck in a non-buffy person into the show in a heart-beat (or lack there of ;))  I'd suggest this to everyone with, or without a pulse.

7916890,5,B000035Z1V,"This is the story arc that made the series.  Buffy actually reached its peak in its third season, but what hooked legions of fans on the series were the episodes in this set  -  the conclusion of the second season, in which Buffy's unlikely but sympathetic vampire boyfriend became, instead, her undead lover, and in so doing lost his soul.
There's no better place to start watching Buffy than with these episodes.  The love and affection built up between Buffy and Angel reaches its pinnacle, and then immediately goes south.  Angel loses his soul as the result of a curse, and becomes what he was before he knew Buffy:  the most evil and sadistic killer in European history.  He joins forces with the two vampires he made himself, centuries before, Spike and Drusilla.  Spike is Buffy's present nemesis and the killer of two previous Slayers, and Drusilla is Angel's crowning achievement, a gifted religious psychic whom he systematically drove out of her mind before making her an eternally undead blood-drinker.
As Buffy's great love, David Boreanaz plays Angel as a loveable lug  -  as Angelus, the scourge of Europe, he is the fiercest and most vile opponent Buffy ever faced.  The episodes in this set show him at his skin-crawling worst:  stalking, playing sadistic cat-and-mouse games, and murdering the loved ones of Buffy and her friends to demoralize her before going in for the final kill.  Buffy has to defeat her own emotions to go up against him, and in the end has her sanity blasted to ashes by having to send Angel to Hell in order to prevent an apocalypse  -  after he regains his lost soul.
This is tear-jerker drama at its best, amazingly intense without degenerating into soap-opera.  These episodes are extremely well-written and -acted, sufficiently that even newcomers to the show will no doubt enjoy them simply on their own merit.
Fans need no recommendation to watch these tapes.  As for you newcomers, remember the inscription over Dante's Hellmouth:  ""Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here""  -  for to watch these episodes is to fall hopelessly in love with Buffy, and become hooked.",1020902400,10,2112,4.862745098039215

7916893,5,B000035Z1V,"Before they went their separate ways, Buffy Summers and her ensouled vampire boyfriend, Angel were one of young entertainment's hottest character couples.
Chronicling their relationship whilst still in the fictional town of Sunnydale, this gift set explains just why our hearts were won. When the show first premiered, I wondered what had become of Pike and how the writers could replace him with somebody that was apparently another loner character, but the relationship quickly grew on me and became an additional reason to like the show.
Like every good drama, this set covers both the highs and equally intense lows of an unconventional couple. What started out as a bit/ assistant part ended up being a regular role on a wildly popular television franchise. Even if such plot development was not the original intent of the creators and directors, it spawned a cherrished storyline.
Although Buffy's only lasting relationship is with somebody who looks conventionally attractive, it is repeatedly stressed that he is not a real man (both a reference to his vampirism and the little blurbs of feminist comments that came out of the characters mouths in the inaugural season).  Nerveless, that supposedly unreal man is the stuff the slayer dreams of and television audiences became enamored with.
Aside from the fact that the writing appears to be more complex than has appeared on recent episodes, there is a genuine chemistry between stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz. Neither is a totally perfect actor, but what lacks in prestige makes up for in apparently obvious comfort.
Forget the television, any newcomers to the Buffy TV Cannon should start here for their education.",1013212800,3,1691,5.171532846715328

The Angel/Buffy Love theme playing when Angel regained his soul after losing it just made me bawl like a child, though I would've changed the backround song (Full of Grace, by Sara McLachlan) to I will remmeber you, or Angel, by the same artist. Whenever I hear a clip, or the full track of the Buffy/Angel theme, I cry, because I remember the great acting that was done in this episode, and it was like i was the one killing Angel.",1009670400,2,673,4.524590163934426
7916896,5,B000035Z1V,"After a first series packed with delicious parodies, witty comedy and great action sequences, people began to take notice of 'Buffy'.  Interestingly enough, the show was originally cancelled in Britain due it being placed in a late night slot.  Thankfully, after some re-runs at a more accessible time, it became the cult show that we all know and love.
Series Two delivered in style, and looking back it had all those gothic elements of vampirism that the whole myth stems from.  Yet the genius of it is that Joss Whedon managed to effectively blend this with slick references to pop culture, winning comedy and brilliant action.
In the episodes 'Surprise', it's Buffy's birthday.  With Spike and Drusilla (excellently played by James Marsteres and Juliet Landau), plotting to raise The Judge, who can literally burn the humanity out of you, it's not going to be a birthday that she'll easily forget.  Along with the usual story comes that famous story arc that really got people talking about the show in terms of quality television rather than mere teen viewing.  At the prospect of having to leave one another, the two realise their love and consumate their love.  The next day, Buffy learns that all men are demons when Angel becomes Angelus, his former evil vampiric self, after he experiences true happiness.  The episode 'Innocence' follows up on this trauma, with simply outstanding acting from both Gellar and Boreanaz.  The last scene is truly heartbreaking, with Buffy cuddling up to her mother.  When her mother asks her what she did for her birthday Buffy's subdued reply says it all.  This is the episode where every viewer will find themselves sobbing.
Wanting to follow up such dramatic episodes with even more dramatic episodes has always been the way for 'Buffy' and the next two on this tape are great.  In 'I Only Have Eyes For You', there's an intriguing spin on the usual ghost story, with even the ghost itself being 'fleshed out', so to speak, as a full character.  Yet it is the next episode that will truly haunt you, 'Passion' being one of the genuinely scary moments on 'Buffy' as we see Jenny Calendar run through the school halls from Angelus.  Especially when we see Giles walk up to the bedroom in search of Jenny, it is gripping television.  Anthony Stewart Head himself states that this was his favourite episode, and it is a remarkably 'human' episode, giving a perspective on loss that few other shows have managed.
Finally, the last two episodes will completely blow you away as they are not only wildly exciting yet also emotionally draining.  These last two episodes of Series Two are often seen as the best in many fans eyes, and it's not hard to see why.  We're let into Angel's past - notice that Darla and Buffy both say 'close your eyes' before his death(s) - and each character's emotional tumult crashes onto our screens.  It's hard to pick a best part of this episode, it's just better to watch it for yourself.  Television has never been this good.",1008633600,2,2997,4.784466019417476
7916897,5,B000035Z1V,"This show is my favorite and the episodes in this set are some of the best!
plot for each of these episodes combined:
Spike and Drusilla are building a demon called ""The Judge"" who wants to kill Buffy and Angel. Jenny Calender who is a teacher at Sunnydale High and Giles's girlfriend, is a gypsy who's uncle made a spell so that when Angel experiences true hapiness he will loose his soul and become evil, and one night Angel and Buffy make love which causes him to become evil. Jenny feels really bad for Buffy, so she searches for the spell to bring Angel back to being good, but Angel ends up killing her and leaving her body in Giles's bed. Then, two ghosts are in the halls of Sunnydale High and Giles is convinced that Jenny is one of them. That episode ends with Buffy and Angel being posessed and kiss, but then the spirits leave their bodies and Angel runs away. Then, Angel and Drusilla plan to open the gates to hell and end the world, and Spike joins Buffy. Kendra, the slayer who was called when Buffy died for a few minutes, returns to help Buffy also. One of the characters die in the season finale, and alot are hurt. The ending is very dramatic and intense.
Buy this if you are a Buffy fan! Every minute of these 6 episodes are dramatic and intense.",1007251200,,1267,4.3277310924369745
7916898,4,B000035Z1V,"Be honest. Action series with female leads have a rough row to how in our society. Imagine someone saving the world from armageddon or being the Chosen One to protect mankind from the forces of evil, and names like Arnold and Sylvester come to mind, perhaps followed closely by Jean Claude or Bruce or Chuck. Big muscles and a hairy chest were prerequesites. Then along came this small, attractive girl: Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The name is almost an oxymoron in and of itself. AND IT WORKS! Gentle, naieve, with a team of laughable sidekicks who manage, week after week, to defeat the forces of evil, defend mankind, and grow up into a bunch of totally likable, if strange, adults. Along the way, the show portrays comedy, drama, tragedy, romance, and some of the best fight choreography on tv today. And now they even have a pretty good musical episode. Watch it, enjoy it. We need all the heroes we can get, and Buffy is a genuine hero.",1006819200,,940,4.601190476190476
