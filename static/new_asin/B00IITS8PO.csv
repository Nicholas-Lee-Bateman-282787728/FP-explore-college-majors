6265528,5,B00IITS8PO,"Second Opinion: Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering is the true story of one mans quest to expose the truth about the efficacy of a controversial cancer treatment, laetrile, in the 1970s. The story was told by the man himself, Ralph W Moss, Phd. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Eric Merola, who produced and directed the film, is skilled in plot development and I was drawn into the story immediately. I could tell that the subject had been well-researched and was impressed with all the archival film footage that Merola was able to find to put into the film. I loved how Dr. Moss told his story and was uplifted by the fact that he isn't bitter about what happened to him.
It is a sad commentary on todays society that the use of viable cancer treatments are not used if they cannot make money for the industry. It is also sad that whistle blowers are treated like criminals instead of the brave conscientious people that most of them are.
Second Opinion is an important film and I hope many people choose to watch it. The DVD also came with another 74 minutes of extras that give the viewer a more in-depth and frightening look at the cancer industry in general. It is a real eye-opener.
I gave this movie 5 stars because it was artistically pleasing as well as an extremely important story. I recommend this film to anyone who is ever in need of health care in the United States.",1394582400,50,1378,4.450592885375494

If enough men like Ralph Moss would speak up about the truths they find, AND more and more people watch other documentaries (like ""The Truth About Cancer), perhaps the tide can turn on the control big pharma has, and perhaps, hopefully, a day will come when the 'cancer industry' will exist no more.  Would that we all, at least most of us would really explore the effects of our food, environment, so-called medicinal drugs and vaccines; then, the links would become clear and REAL work would be demanded to eradicate cancer.  No, this wasn't in the scope of this excellent documentary, but there are several that do explore and implicate the real causes.

6265543,1,B00IITS8PO,"Amygdalin (from Ancient Greek:  amygdl ""almond""), is a poisonous cyanogenic glycoside found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of apricot, bitter almonds, apple, peach, and plum.

Since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named laetrile have been promoted as alternative cancer treatments, often using the misnomer Vitamin B17.[1] But studies have found them to be clinically ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to cyanide poisoning. Neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a vitamin.

The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery,[2][3] and as ""the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history."".

6265585,5,B00IITS8PO,"Pay attention to this film, buy it: help to support humanity's compassionate cause; help to make a better future.  This documentary is informative and educational.... unfortunately, it's one of too many examples in the world of innovative cancer therapies being marginalized by our so called ""sick-care"" industry here in the US.

Clearly, the clinical data has demonstrated that Laetrile works for some people: are you surprised to hear this?  History has shown that scientists (especially medical doctors) continue to refuse to apply the scientific method to their own methodology in research.  This is just as true today as it was... say for example... 150 years ago when Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was beaten to death {for discovering  that doctors should wash their hands before surgery}.

I'm a aerospace engineer with advanced degrees in mathematics and physics.  When I was diagnosed with cancer ten years ago: I found it hard to understand why my doctor was coercing me to get multiple CAT Scans every year... even after three years; even though my pre-op scan and every one of my post-op scans were negative.  If I had presented only a few years earlier, they would have required retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), then chemo and radiation therapy {which would have provided no clinical benefit what-so-ever}  The top Urologist in the state eventually told me that I never needed even one CAT scan... he said that they were just trying to scare me, in order to make money off my situation. The top Urologist in the state said that!

In every age PhD scientists struggle with new ideas, regardless of the data and/or the efficacy of the current theoretical basis that might support the data; but even worse: PhD scientists struggle with the truth... especially if it compromises their egos or financial security.  PhDs in every age refuse to accept progress: example: if you were a geology graduate student in the 1950s and you supported the concepts once called 'continental-drift', you were ostracized; while only ten years later, you'd be the Nobel Laureate who discovered Plate Tectonics.  The earth is what it is, regardless of how you might allow others to describe it.

Government has no place forcing citizens to comply with corporate special interests.  You should be able to eat or drink whatever you want; you should have a right to choose your medical treatment - if and or when you are diagnosed with cancer, and especially if you are facing end of life issues..... when it happens to you.... you'll know what I mean.

A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

This documentary is nothing short of amazing in what it so credibly reveals.  Certainly anyone who has, or wants to prevent, cancer must see this film.  For the rest of us who are truth seekers interested in more proof of how the system is rigged it is also a must.  I know well the politics in cancer, but even so was shocked at how blatantly malevolent the forces of industry and government could be.  I do not feel it is an exaggeration to use the term 'Satanic' to describe what Ralph Moss revealed in Second Opinion!
I am a  Orthomolecular Nurse-Nutritionist now retired from my private practice (teaching folks to eat right and doing functional vitamin & mineral lab testing). Over the years of participating, with my patients, in the miracles of recovery from whole-foods, allergy elimination, detoxing, and mega-vitamin therapy, I accumulated a great deal of information, and quite a library, on the politics of medicine in general and cancer medicine as well.  The fraud, lies, and deceit committed by mainstream, orthodox, Allopathic medicine, Big Pharma, and FDA  are legion and documented.  Their paradigm of symptom suppression by drugs is very limited in focus, but they resist & attack (often viciously) anyone with alternative concepts.  The better the alternative works, the more its attacked--because its a competitor.  Amygdalin/Laetrile presents a real threat because it has real anti-cancer effects and that is reiterated so well by Ralph Moss in this amazing documentary! Among the sources that document Laetrile's benefit in cancer treatment is a book called ""the Death of Cancer"" by Loyola University's biology professor, Harold W. Manner, PhD. who researched Laetrile and wrote that book in 1988.  It has been in my library since that time, and I've had the pleasure of attending a talk many years ago by its author Dr. Manner.  Dr. Manner was not a kook or so-called ""quack"" ( a term inappropriately thrown around to attack anyone disrupting the medical status quo.)  There is so much hope for recovery from cancer and other chronic diseases within alternative/functional medicine and Ralph Moss has given us a great gift of hope in blowing the lid off the world of cancer.",1421107200,30,2316,5.031413612565445

I want to personally thank Eric Merola, Ralph Moss, and the others who have fought to keep the truth out there, so that we can see what is really going on in the cancer industry.

Many comments previously which describe the outiine of the story, but suffice it to say, the details are meticulously revealed and Mr. Moss, speaking to the camera.  is totally believable.

Also, mouse experiments do not necessarily equate to efficacy in humans.

8642431,4,B00IITS8PO,"Thank you Dr. Moss for bringing this to story to light.
As films and other sources with accounts similar to this continue to be brought forward, Is it any wonder so many of us doubt what is presented as ""scientific evidence""?
When I was young, the 60's and 70's, it was considered ""liberal"" to question authority. Doctor Moss and others mentioned in this film are the living examples.
Today individuals who dare question are attacked and labeled as a ""denier"", or worse by establishment ""scientist"", mainstream media, politicians and government officials, many even calling for criminal penalties against dissenters!
Ironic that the most egregious of these modern day authoritarians are from the political left, or perhaps not, huh Dr Moss?",1509235200,,740,5.175
8642432,5,B00IITS8PO,"Thank God for brave souls like Moss!  Laetrile is only ONE example of this sort of situation.  Sadly, there were no emails at that time, so we cannot dig up the conversations between Meeting #1 and Meeting #2. No doubt pertinent papers have long since hit the shredder. What do YOU think might have been communicated?  For good health info see these books: Should I Be Tested for Cancer by H. Gilbert Welch and  Radical Remission by Kelly A.

This is another sad story about how politics and profit stopped a revolutionary idea in it's tracks. What would the market do if there was a sudden drop in the need for chemotherapy?",1503792000,3,420,4.3164556962025316

So he had to be sneaky in using it-- which worked!  When patients were cured it raised some eyebrows and the sniffing began trying to discover what was wrong!  A patient was cured!!!  Not supposed to happen. Big money in Cancer Research! - without any results hopefully.
Film quality leaves a lot to be desired since it was made on the QT.",1498176000,4,513,4.730337078651686
