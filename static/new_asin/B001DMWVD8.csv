8294154,5,B001DMWVD8,"The first time I bought this DVD was when my child was struggling with self calming. It was an impulse purchase and it turned out to be a sanity saver. Its is beautiful and the music is wonderful and all together it is perfect. My child now puts it on a loop independently.

It is by far the best sensory calming DVD we have used. A friend with anxiety  came to visit when it was on and asked for the title to order it for themselves.

We have bought 3 of these as my child has used it so frequently that we had occasionally broken one.

It's amazing and way worth the money.",1361923200,2,575,4.061946902654867
8294155,5,B001DMWVD8,"If you are looking for just a really nice DVD with beautiful scenery, then buy this one. I love Ireland and have never been. By watching this, I feel as if I am really there. My husband really enjoyed this as well.",1358208000,,214,4.119047619047619

8294157,5,B001DMWVD8,I bought this dvd about three years ago. I finally killed it and need to buy another one. My grandchildren have slept to this dvd whenever they are at my home. It is the best relaxing dvd/cd I have ever found. What I love the most is the continuous play mode. It is great!!!,1305072000,2,274,4.092592592592593
8294158,5,B001DMWVD8,"Bought this dvd because I wanted to try something different with the music selection in my home. I am a stay at home mother and I pop this in and all my worries go away. I enjoy listening to it daily as I clean, do laundry, pay my bills... etc. Even when guests come over they enjoy the beautiful scenery of Ireland on the TV as the music flows through the house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who had a love for Ireland or wants to escape the ""real"" world.",1304467200,4,471,4.130434782608695
8294159,5,B001DMWVD8,"I bought this dvd because I was getting tired of listening to rock, alternative,reggae, hip hop and whatever else there might be.  I was thinking it would be good to start listening to it at work..since alot of people don't mind soothing music. Well I popped in and started watching and listening...It is amazing. The sights, the music I was so pleased with the dvd that I bought another one for my home.  It has been a way for me to relax my nerves and forget about the everyday stresses in life.  I pop this on and boom! My way of thinking shifts and I begin to feel good.

I highly recommend this...",1285804800,3,602,4.300884955752212
