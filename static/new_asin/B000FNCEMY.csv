The cinematography is amazing at times and the concept of the movie is thoroughly fasinating. I am glad to see the originality and creativity in Limbo, something which is currently lacking in the movie industry today and feel the Limbo team have done an AMAZING job, especially when you find out how much the movie cost to make...shhhhhhhhh...I'll keep quiet...but the bonus material on this dvd will reveal all.

The bonus material for me was what I really liked about the DVD, it contains, deleted scenes (with narratives as to why scenes were taken out), along with interviews and behind the scenes footage.

In short, this movie is a must buy, especially for aspiring film makers - it will highlight what is possible with a dream and motivation. I look forward to seeing future work from this there Thomas Ikimi - he clearly has an interesting career ahead of him and I wish him all the best.

I am an aspiring filmmaker, and feel fortunate to have seen this film because it is an excellent example of how storytelling and vision can overcome budget limitations.

I expect writer/director Thomas Ikimi has a bright future ahead of him.",1156032000,,395,5.140625
8124810,5,B000FNCEMY,"Can I just start by saying that this film is a must-buy. I saw this film at a festival and after the first watch, I was very confused. But then after days, I began to see all the multi-layered meanings and the deepness of the film.
 The directing is great, there are times where I felt lost in limbo and there are some memorable shots. The performances are all great but the one that stands out is when Adam meets Lasloe...won't spoil it for you but it's a great scene.
 This film will be a classic, no doubt. Just can't wait for part 2!!!!!!",1151280000,,542,4.201923076923077
