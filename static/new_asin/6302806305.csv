516965,4,6302806305,"This collection is a funny collection of this talented, physically funny trio at a reasonable price. It is smart to provide a collection such as this so the Stooges work is not lost. This collection provides laughs because of the themed collection  of physically funny and many times double edged meanings of their lines and dialogue.",1188691200,,334,4.964285714285714
516966,4,6302806305,"It's unclear if this disc is supposed to be organised around a specific theme, the way most of the other discs in this series are.  There are three Western-themed shorts, with the other three covering a wide variety of subjects.  One wishes that Columbia would just get their act together and either start releasing these discs with shorts that all actually have something to do with the self-proclaimed theme, or start over from scratch by releasing the shorts in chronological order (and with a ""Play All"" feature; it's very annoying how you have to select the shorts one by one instead of having at least the option to play them all back-to-back).  That said, the shorts included are:

'Whoops, I'm an Indian!' (1936)  This short has some funny moments, like the fishing scene, Bud Jamison's French accent, and the opening fixed gambling scene, but other than that it's one of their weaker entries from 1936.  It's solid and entertaining enough, just not anything really special or memorable.  There's also far too little slapstick or punishment, and the ending also is pretty weak and abrupt.

'Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb' (1938), the title short, is a classic.  I can't believe some people feel that the remake, 'A Missed Fortune' (1952), was actually better and funnier.  Everything flows so well, with not a wasted scene or gag, and there are too many funny and classic scenes to mention.  As a animal lover, I also loved the gold-diggers' cute little pet monkey.  The only somewhat weak spot in this short is the ending, which didn't provide any resolution to their troubles with the hotel manager.

'Rockin' Thru the Rockies' (1940) is a Western-themed short, though at least it doesn't find the boys playing a bunch of dopey cowboys.  This makes it funnier and quicker-paced than most of their other Western shorts.  I did cringe a bit at how the Native Americans were portrayed, but frankly I've seen much, much worse in films of this period, so it's not like this is the most offensive and inaccurate depiction of Native Americans ever set to film.  And they're not even in that many scenes, so they're not the main focus of this short.  Maybe not one of their topmost classics, but this is a nice little gem that's one of their oft-overlooked second-tier classics.

'Phony Express' (1943) is a real Western, which means it's not as funny or fast-paced as most of their other shorts.  The beginning is pretty good, but it really slows down from that point on.  In addition to the fact that I already don't like Westerns, the boys just never really seemed believable as slow-witted cowboys or in an Old West setting.  Of course they were already pretty dumb, but underneath that outward veneer of stupidity, we know that they're actually quite witty and smart.  The Old West setting also gave these shorts a much slower pace, which isn't very good for slapstick.  We also see another ending that doesn't really have the greatest resolution of the situation.  Still, at least it's one of their better Western shorts, and it is better than the dreadful remake 'Merry Mavericks' (1951).

'Gents Without Cents' (1944) is a bona-fide classic, even if only for the ""Niagara Falls"" skit.  It also demonstrates how entertainers in those days really had to be able to do it all (singing, dancing, acting, the whole nine yards), particularly since many of them got started in vaudeville, as opposed to entertainers today who only can do one thing.  However, I do agree that it kind of slows down with the dancing routine the girls do at the show put on at the shipyard (although at least they cut into less time than in the similar 'Rhythm and Weep' [1946]).  Still, it's nice to get a glimpse of what their vaudeville act must have been like.

'If a Body Meets a Body' (1945) is a remake of 'The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case' (1930), and officially ushers in the sick Curly era.  It's shocking to see how different he sounds and looks from how he did in the classic 'Idiots Deluxe,' the short that came out just prior to this.  Still, this is one of the few enjoyable shorts from this painful era, since here he has significantly more energy than in something like 'Three Loan Wolves' or 'A Bird in the Head.'  He also still has a lot of physical coordination and dexterity in this short.  So it's not one of those later shorts where you're really distracted by how he looks, sounds, and acts like a sick man (though there are a few eerie moments here when his cries of pain actually sound real and not just like he's acting).  Overall, a pretty good short and a nice spoof of horror movies.

These shorts might not all be of the same consistently great quality, but there are enough good ones here to recommend it.",1154476800,9,4717,4.683252427184466
516967,4,6302806305,"Don't pay any attention to the reviews about the DVD version.  This is the VHS version, and it contains three episodes--Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb, Disorder in the Court, and Pardon my Scotch.  The first and last are both classics, some of the stooges best work.  Disorder in the Court is very funny too, but part of the public domain, and every stooge fan already has it.

As for those idiots who thought this was the DVD version, you all are the real stooges.",1120694400,6,461,4.518072289156627
516968,5,6302806305,"Nice DVD, but can anyone remind me: What was the title of the episode with Shemp and the fountain pen that wrote under whipped cream?  Has anyone released this yet?  If so, what collection?  Thanks.",1079654400,3,198,4.6
516969,5,6302806305,"HEALTHY, WEALTHY, AND DUMB is a collection of six classic Stooge shorts. The films all star the original stooges: Larry, Moe, and Curly. The films are unbelievable clear and crisp and are of the highest quality.  The six films on this DVD are:
""Healthy, Wealthy, and Dumb""--Curly wins a fortune in a jingle contest. The stooges decide to live it up in style. Three gold diggers find out about their good luck and attempt to steal the boys away, but just for their money. However, the stooges learn that Uncle Sam isn't very generous.
""Gents Without Cents""--in this story, the Stooges are a bunch of comedy performers trying to get their break in show business. They team up with girls in the apartment below and put on a great showstopper for the armed services. This film contains the famous ""Niagra Falls"" vaudeville bit.
""If a Body Meets a Body""--the boys spend a night in a house that appears to be haunted.  This film seems like something Abbot and Costello would make, but the Stooges pull it off brilliantly. It makes me wish they would have made more comedies like this.
""Rockin' Thru the Rockies""--the Stooges are supposed to be guides and escorts for Nell's Belles, but on their way find themselves lost in the woods. They have to watch out for Indians and a snowstorm.
""Phony Express""--the Stooges are vagrants, but a town desperate for some law and order uses their wanted poster to make them into marshalls.  Things go great until the bad guys discover the truth.
""Whoops, I'm an Indian""--the Stooges disguise themselves as Indians to hide out from a big man who has a big temper.
This is a great collection of classic, Stooge comedy.  I specifically bought this DVD for ""Gents Without Cents"" (the Niagra Falls routine has haunted me all my life) and ""If a Body Meets a Body"", but the other features are just as great to watch.",1074643200,47,1840,4.669753086419753
516970,3,6302806305,"This is an okay DVD. There are three shorts I like, and three that bore me. I enjoyed HEALTHY WEALTHY AND DUMB, IF A BODY MEETS A BODY, and ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES. WHOOPS I'M AN INDIAN, GENTS WITHOUT CENTS, and PHONY EXPRESS bored me. Still an okay DVD.",1011571200,5,255,4.224489795918367
516971,4,6302806305,"This is an excellent tape. PARDON MY SCOTCH is a very funny short. DISORDER IN THE COURT is in my top 5 favorite Curly films. Excellent gags, fast-paced scenes, and the funniest Stooge here turns out to be Larry. HEALTHY, WEALTHY, AND DUMB is a true classic. There's a great scene where Curly mistakes a canopy for the top of a bunk bed. Great short.
A great tape, worth adding to your collection.",1010102400,2,397,4.4520547945205475
516972,5,6302806305,"You have to love these guys. Their comic genius will last long after we have departed. Columbia needs to speed up the process of getting these DVD's out to the fans. They need to also put these into box sets. Columbia screwed the Stooges when they were alive, now they are doing it to us. Only a few shorts on each DVD! There is no excuse for that! DVD is all about being able to hold much more than video. This is just like paramount is doing to the original ""Star Trek"" series. Dragging it out so that you buy in as little increments as possible for the most dollars! Maybe by the time we get to the next turn of the century all of their work will finally be out.",1001376000,7,665,4.083969465648855
516973,3,6302806305,"PARDON MY SCOTCH (1935) - Great film.  I think this is their first  of many ""society"" shorts.  Most Stooge fans already know the story - when Moe did the stunt in which he falls off a table, and crashes to the floor, the stunt wasn't so safe, and Moe ended up with several broken ribs. He stood up after the fall, and was able to speak several words, before fainting, and had to be hospitalized immediately. I admire Moe's courage and commitment to try his best continuing the scene despite all the pain he was in.
DISORDER IN THE COURT (1936) - Ah yes.  When you think of classi Stooge shorts, this is usually the first short that pops in people's minds.  An all time classic with non-stop memorable and hilarious moments, the best being Curly's classic ""take off your hat"" routine. One of the Stooges' best, and a true classic.
HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND DUMB (1938) - Why's this short so darn bright on the video tape???  You can hardly see anything.  Anyway, another great short. Funniest scene is when Curly lays on top of the canopy bed, and the whole thing crashes to little pieces.  That scene always kills me.
Would've been a 4 star tape if the visual quality hadda been better.  I had to dock a point.  Seriously, that print of HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND DUMB gives me a headache.",994291200,5,1278,4.469827586206897
