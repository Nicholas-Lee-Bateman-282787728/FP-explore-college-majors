7961082,5,B000065NOU,"Underrated, my whole life, this movie has been vastly underrated. Cheesy at times yes, but so good, and unexpected performances by john Travolta, Vince Vaughn, Teri Polo, and Steve Buscemi. A+",1479081600,,192,5.225806451612903
7961083,5,B000065NOU,"Enjoy this thriller/drama. John Travolta and his co-stars have good chemistry. Movie offers nice scenery and is fairly quiet, not a loud movie for the most part. Mostly quiet, but not boring. Good storyline. Sometimes more interested in  a quieter movie with a little action that offers a more relaxing movie experience. This one is a good addition to any collection.",1425513600,,367,5.016393442622951
7961084,5,B000065NOU,"A suspenseful, gripping series! Based on entities created out of the backlashes of our country's foreign and domestic politics. I personally felt the intensity in the interal burning desire of the S.E.A.L.S to stop an evil nemesis, operating with complete impunity. Leaving in its wake a mounting level of collateral damages.
