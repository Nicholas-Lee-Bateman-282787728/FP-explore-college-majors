2755510,5,0005114349,"Celtic Thunder Christmas is an enjoyable experience. The songs include those that focus on Christmas and those which look at the season, the winter, the snow and the like. The most poignant of the songs, one I listened to several times was Christmas 1915. It was about a battle against German forces. On Christmas night, the men of the two forces came out of the foxholes and joined one another and sang together. Each side was impressed by the singing of a 21-year-old German. He sang so beautifully that he was asked to sing again. The next morning the fighting resumed and they killed the 21-year-old singer.",1514160000,,611,4.719626168224299

2755516,5,0005114349,Gifted to my friends who grew up in the region of The Smokies in Tennessee. They enjoyed immensely.,1507248000,,99,4.555555555555555
2755517,3,0005114349,"There was a lot to like about this movie, but ultimately, it ended up disappointing me.

Sarah Lancaster, who plays the heroine, Shelby, is lovely. Actually, I loved the acting from everyone in this movie, and even looked up the actor who plays the hero (Alan Powell) because I didn't recognize him and thought he did a great job.

The scenery is to die for. Gorgeous. The Christmas decorations are equally as gorgeous (although I kept wondering why it wasn't snowing during Christmas if the movie was taking place in the Smokies). It might be worth watching just for the scenery alone. It's that beautiful.

The story - meh. It was okay. Run of the mill. It had a couple of surprises (although I kept wondering why Mason Wyatt didn't have any money if he was a bestselling country artist. If they said where it went, I missed it), but by and large, just an average type story.

The thing that saves these movies for me is the romance. I expected this to be a romance. I expected to watch Shelby and Mason fall in love (or back in love, in this case, since Mason broke Shelby's heart years ago). This doesn't really happen. Shelby is mad at Mason for almost the entire movie (because of said previous heartbreak). They don't get a chance to talk out what happened (and I was left wondering why he abandoned her all those years ago because there was never an explanation). They don't get to be romantic with one another. There's no chemistry, no feelings explored. It's literally like the very last scene of the movie that something finally happens - they dance together on her parents' porch. The end. No kissing, no I love yous, no getting engaged, nothing.

Which is disappointing and the reason I was watching. It also seems to be the reason for the movie because the movie is focused on this rift between Shelby and Mason but then doesn't do much to repair it or to make it seem like they're falling in love with each other. Which would have been very easy to do - for example, Shelby is digging some holes for fence repairs. She has to leave. Mason then starts digging the holes for her. She could have come back and realized what he'd done. Tender/sweet moment there that was totally missed. Or Mason is helping out her father by chopping logs. It's initially played for laughs and as a bonding moment between her dad and her ex-boyfriend, which was fine, but once he got back into the swing of things, she should have seen him chopping wood for her family and been touched by his efforts to help out.

Instead you got a movie full of Shelby's caustic and mean remarks to Mason (and it's worse that she's treating him badly considering how much he's doing for her family) and him with a hangdog expression taking her abuse and not making any effort to really mend what's wrong between them. I don't know what the thinking was on this one - it was like, ""Let's make a movie that centers around a romance but not spend any time on the romance or have anything romantic happen between the two leads at all, but it will be the majority of what the characters talk about and we'll resolve it by having them dance without working out their issues or apologizing. Go!""

When I watch a movie that presents itself as a romance, I'd like a romance, please.",1505692800,4,3252,4.483108108108108

2755569,5,0005114349,"This is another one I bought before I saw it on TV. I'm not sorry I bought it, thank goodness. I bought it because it was set in the Smokies-one of my favorite places. We visit there twice a year and could have bought a place for the money we've spent. We have the problem of getting the whole family to join us and all finding a way to make a living. This movie didn't give me much hope that it could ever happen. Being raised on a farm in the ""hills of Kentucky"" not mountains, I loved the farm scenes. People from out of state have called the area around here mountains but they are just hills; the mountains are in the eastern part of the state. I understood the fight of the protagonist wanting to save her farm. Our whole area tried to do that when the TN Army Corps of Engineers, decided to take acres of farmland and turn it into a lake. Therefore, I love it when someone wins against the big guys. We couldn't save our home; I can never show my kids where I grew up; it's all underwater - so maybe I loved the fight this girl had in her and her winning more than some. I won't say the acting was great or that anything was unpredictable but it's great when the farmer wins and you just can't go wrong in the Smokies. I do say I agree with the people who've said they don't understand her holding on to the anger against a boyfriend for so long, but they had to make a movie. I enjoy these type of movies; trying to save the farm, etc. I have a city born and bred husband and my children were also. They only visited the grandparents on the farm after their grandparents had retired. They know nothing of that world and I love watching something that takes me back for a while. It's a nice relaxing movie. I'll watch it several times, I'm sure.",1483315200,7,1752,4.140762463343108

Everybody else was supposed to ignore their needs and desires and give her what she wanted. If they didn't she treated them like crap, and if they did she was nice to them--sometimes. It was just very hard to watch because I stayed angry at her all the time.

The lead actress seemed immature, I don't understand why she would be hung up on her teenage boyfriend leaving when she looks 30. It would have made sense if she was left with a child or something because her bitterness did not seem plausible. Also, her parents act like they don't own the farm, they seem incapable of helping at all. And I don't see chemistry at all between the lead actors.",1482019200,2,557,4.264150943396227

It's not that it was bad, and I really liked most of the characters and actors (not the male lead actor), but I had moral issues with the female lead's character. She held a grudge for way too long over something that should have been upsetting but not life-changing. Later, when she thinks she gets what she wants, she's happy. When there's a chance she might not, she throws a fit until the guy makes an unnecessary (and stupid) choice just to make her happy. I really like the actress, but her character could have been so much better. Aside from all that, I can see where a lot of people would enjoy this story.
