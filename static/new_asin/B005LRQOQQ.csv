8478423,1,B005LRQOQQ,I worked there for eight years and never saw any paranormal activity.,1472601600,,69,4.833333333333333
8478424,2,B005LRQOQQ,filming was not very clear.  Would recommend to think hard before buying this video.  It jumped from topic to topic and not ending a segment before going on to something else.  I found it boring in alot of it'ts parts.,1396396800,,218,4.4
8478425,5,B005LRQOQQ,"Wow! This place looks really active! So, without giving away anything, I think there was some amazing evidence caught by the group. To be honest, I don't think I've ever seen anything like what they have on film. The location is interesting and seems nearly ""untouched"" by the paranormal world (not overdone!) with a pretty wild history. I enjoyed this documentary from beginning to end and feel like the group really captured the feel of this place. I look forward to checking out more of this group's work.",1352332800,,508,4.784090909090909
8478426,5,B005LRQOQQ,"This is a great look at an amazing location with a haunted history that has not been over-hyped by the paranormal TV shows.  This documentary takes a true look at the history, paranormal experiences of staff and paranormal investigations of Historic Jordan Springs.  While some AMAZING unexplained events are captured on film in the documentary...they are not shoved down your throat, telling you what you should think.  If you are looking for a true documentary involving the paranormal, look no further.  If you want a Hollywood TV producer's version of what the paranormal should be, then check out one of the many paranormal reality shows.",1351987200,,643,5.095238095238095
