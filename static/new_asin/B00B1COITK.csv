5544269,4,B00B1COITK,"This film reminds me of 'Arbitrage' with Richard Gere. Both Gere's character, and Marc Tourneuil, this film's protagonist are in it for the money. No good thing goes undone, here.

Tourneuil promoted to CEO of thevPhenix Bank when the present CEO develops cancer is very much aware he is to be the 'place maker' until the bank's board finds someone they really want. However, Tourneuil is not to be outdone. He discovers there are many who want to control him  such as Gabriel Byrne's character who lures him to Miami to give him the lowdown of what is to be done. Tourneuil, however, is no fool and his plans have him staying at Phenix.

Everyone around him have their own ideas,mhis wife, the Board, his colleagues, everyone. However, Tourneuil is greedy, and he plans the play. Gad Elmaleh plays Marc Tourneuil, and I looked him up. He is known as a comedian in Morroco, but as we see, comedians often make the best actors.  The film felt too long in some places, but kept my interest for the most part.

5544270,5,B00B1COITK,This was a remarkably good film. It did for the French banking system what Too Big to Fail did for the American banking system...it explained banking and stocks while revealing layer upon layer of messy human meddling.  World banking is so big and complex that it's best not to think about it too hard.,1409356800,,302,4.592592592592593
5544271,5,B00B1COITK,"I've read that film studios used to insist on a love story subplot in the likes of Marx Brothers comedies to give the audience something socially redeeming.  To this day, you may see a movie with a romance to broaden audience appeal as opposed to being anything essential to the narrative.

However, as the sparks fly between investment banker Marc Tourneuil and famous model Nassim when they meet in the 2012 thriller CAPITAL, no redemption or happy ending is to be the result.  Suddenly ascending to the position of bank C.E.O., Marc, the lead character, does not seem to realize he's becoming what he despises, his actions culminating in his behavior toward the model.  Nassim, who could very well be anything any of us wants, may as well be just another object of hostile takeover.  Not a plot device or even an excuse to give the audience a romance just in case it does not care for the main story, the CAPITAL Marc-Nassim relationship proves symbolic of all one needs to understand about today's financial world.  When certain individuals want to own something, they proceed as if their desire for it means it's already theirs.

5544272,4,B00B1COITK,"LE CAPITAL is an interesting film to compare with Martin Scorsese's
WOLF OF WALL STREET, released a year later. Both contain similar
subject-matter (the rapacity of the modern-day banking world) inspired
by recent events in major financial centers such as London, Paris and
New York. Nonetheless Costa-Gavras' film works much better as an
indictment of contemporary greed as compared to Scorsese's. There are
several reasons for this: unlike Leonardo DiCaprio in the Scorsese
work, Marc Tourneuil (Gad Elmaleh) is a genuinely unsympathetic central
character. His expression (in public, at least) seldom changes as he
ruthlessly consolidates his position as CEO of Phenix Bank, a
Paris-based institution with aspirations to participate on the world
stage. Anyone getting in his way is ruthlessly brushed aside; even
those who support him in his quest for power are not exempt. His
personal life is treated equally ruthlessly - although married to Diane
(Natacha Rgnier), he shows no scruples in his relentless pursuit of
supermodel Nassim (Liya Kebede), even though she strings him along with
equal ruthlessness. At the same time Marc is well aware that he is
putting on an act; there are several moments where he uses voice-over
to communicate his true feelings to the audience, and he sometimes
addresses them direct to camera. He is nothing more than a prisoner of
ambition; in the dog-eat-dog world of high finance, he has to play the
game, however much he dislikes it. Sometimes LE CAPITAL does seem a
little over-moralistic in tone - the sequences involving tyro banker
Maud Baron (Cline Sallette)(who sacrifices a promising career in
Phenix Bank's London office in order to expose the corruption lurking
beneath a proposed business deal) tend to be rather static, especially
the one taking place next to the Seine, where Maud invites Marc to give
up his money-dominated existence and pursue the path of righteousness.
On the other hand Costa-Gavras' film makes intelligent use of modern
technology: much of the communication, especially between Marc and his
US-based patron Dittmar Rigule (Gabriel Byrne) is done via videophone.
This strategy indicates how debased the financial world has become; no
one favors face-to-face talk anymore, but would rather put a screen in
front of them, that can be switched off at will. The narrative of LE
CAPITAL unfolds swiftly, making intelligent use of high-tech locations
in London, Paris and New York. Its subject might be familiar, but its
impact remains powerful.",1407369600,2,2511,5.248756218905473

5544275,1,B00B1COITK,"Sadly, this is a dreadful movie that is without any redeeming qualities.  It will likely soon be forgotten from Costa Gavras' overall amazing body of work.  But before I get there, let me first state that I love Costa Gavras's movies in general.  I've seen most of his major films, and in my opinion, among a magnificent overall body of work he's made three brilliant masterpieces:  Z, Missing, and The Music Box.  And this is in addition to a lot of other memorable movies, including State of Siege, Mad City, and Le Couperet, and even Hannah K (a troubled movie that's far from a great film, but which still has stayed with me all these years).

Reportedly this is to be Costa Gavras' final film.  And he's made what's unfortunately his wost movie among the films of his that I've seen.  My spouse and I both hated it and found it unbearable to sit through.

The problem:  The script was written by people who know nothing of what they write, who are not from the world in which the film takes place, and are simply using their imaginations of what it's like.  The scriptwriters wanted to explore a subject and make a point--and it's a subject worth exploring and a point worth making.  But they're writing about situations and characters that they likely don't personally know (and if they've done research on the subject, their research misses it by a mile), and writing about a world that they likely have never been in and really have no idea how it internally functions, how the people within it behave, how they talk to one another, etc.  There's no credibility to any of it.

I know that world and I know these people, including how they behave, talk, etc.  There's not a ring of truth to any of this.  The plot is absurd and beyond implausable, the characters aren't real, and the discussions that take place among them aren't even a little bit real.  It's entirely fraudulent, which is a shame, because the subject matter is one worth exploring.

There was a noble concept behind this movie.  But the development of that concept is so poorly executed that only someone who knows nothing about the universe in which this takes place could conceivably buy any of this.

Thanks, Costa Gavras, for giving us some truly great movies over the years.  Even the not-so-great ones were often worth seeing.  But this is a turkey.",1392422400,8,2330,4.618004866180049
5544276,4,B00B1COITK,"Comparing Capital to Wall Street is no contest. Capital wins hands down.

Not that this movie can be a guide for reality. Costa-Gravas knows more about the financial world than Oliver Stone about finance, but that is like saying that 459 degrees below zero Fahrenheit is more than Absolute Zero. Unlike Stone, Costa-Gravas has a solid understanding of what insider trading is, but that's about it. His main beef about banks seems to be that they make you pay them back. I'm not exaggerating.

But Costa-Gravas is a consummate film maker whereas Stone is nothing more than a crude propagandist, whose audience consists of nincompoops. Costa-Gravas knows how to make even his villains into real people, how to create a stunning mise-en-scene, how to write a plot that moves. Le Capital is worth seeing even if you find the politics distasteful (as I do). Even his wrongheadedness makes you stop and think for a minute.

What's more, you will be greatly entertained.",1387324800,5,963,4.932098765432099
5544277,4,B00B1COITK,"Capital (2012 release from France; 110 min.) brings the story of how Marc Tourneuil (played by Gad Elmaleh) becomes the CEO of Phenix Bank, an investment bank in Paris which its single largest shareholder, a hedge fund In Miami led by Dittmar Rigule (played byGabriel Byrne) feels can be more profitable by cutting costs, firing staff and selling new financial products. At one point a banker asks the CEO ""what exactly are we selling?"", to which the CEO responds ""I don't know, I thought you knew!"". Later in the movie Dittmar is urging the CEO to buy Matzuko, a badly performing bank in Japan, and the CEO smells trouble. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is directed (and co-written) by Costa-Gavras, he of that great political thriller ""Z"" from the late 60s, yes more than 40 years ago. He is now 80 (a young 80, I might add) and still going strong. If Costa-Gavras is involved in a project like this, you can pretty much predict what the tone of the movie is going to be like (similar to Oliver Stone's take on, say, Wall Street). And indeed, in the eyes of Costa-Gavras, there isn't a single decent person in the financial and banking industry (Dittmar at one point blurts out ""money isn't a tool, it's the master!""). Yet despite all that, I was pleasantly surprised how entertaining this movie was, in particular in the second half when the big picture emerges as to what the hedge fund is really trying to do. Second, the acting performances are quite good. Besides the already mentioned Elmaleh and Byrne, there are some smaller choice roles as well. Check out in particular Liya Kebede as the gorgeous looking love interest of the CEO. I saw her earlier this year in ""Day of the Falcon"" and now in this movie. Last but not least, this is a great looking production, going all over the globe (Paris, London, New York, Tokyo).

I don't know why it has taken over a year for this movie (originally shown at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival) to make it to the theatres here in the US, but better late than never I suppose. I was quite surprised when this showed up this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati without any pre-release fanfare or advertising. I figured this would not play long so I went to see it right away. The matinee screening I saw this at today was poorly attended. That aside, I enjou\yed this movie more than I had expected, and if you are in the mood for an entertaining movie from none other than Costa-Gavras himself, ""Capital"" is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blue-ray.",1384041600,7,2681,4.606694560669456

5544303,4,B00B1COITK,"A movie from the acclaimed director Costa Gavras is about banking and the fights in the boardroom to retain power.
Marc Tourneuil ( Gad Elmaleh) is considered by his peers as a pushover, but he is anything but that. He gains the trust of a CEO Jack Marmande ( Daniel Mesguich), so that when Marmande gets cancer, he nominates Marc as the heir. The reluctant board is hesitant but they finally agree. They plan to get rid of Marc, eventually...but they are in for a surprise....as he becomes a thorn in their side. Projecting himself some sort of messiah for the financial system and the bank. Marc increasingly becomes drunk with power and greed. Gavras has managed to make a pretty decent movie about deals in the financial world. The story is fast paced and there are a lot of interesting characters. Dittmar, the American capitalist ( Gabriel Byrne) especially and so is his wife (Natacha Regnier) on whose behest he adopts the Marxist style of  functioning at the bank. Gavras, gives us a peek in to high stakes world of finance with glamour but something is missing in the movie. It could have been better.
The lead Elmaleh is slightly miscast and does does not have the flamboyance and panache of a high profile banker. On the whole, Capital is a good film about boardroom dramas with some clever twists thrown at regular intervals.  Release date: 14th, Nov,2012.",1426032000,,1369,4.7238493723849375

But too often I just felt stumped, confused by the plot.  The various threads of finance, corporate backstabbing, family relationships, personal greed and ambition all seemed to stumble and fizzle.  I had a million questions is long the way but in the end I didn't care enough to watch the movie again or check the internet to get answers.
I also found that none of the main actors  held my attention.  Even the great Gabriel Byrne seemed like he was reading a script in acting class.",1409961600,,612,4.4774774774774775
8560610,5,B00B1COITK,"Money, Sex and Power are big drivers in life, yet Money is the Master. What if you take a huge global bank with a cancer ill CEO, and pick his economist deputy to make him the new CEO temporarily? Gabriel Byrne, and Gad Elmaleh, make for fascinating casting choices in this curious film. Can loyalty be enough to learn the duties on the job really fast? Can investors keep him as a puppet to just increase profits by feeding him the ""right short term ideas"".

Is this possible even if some of those ideas come from a powerful hedge fund with a major stake in the bank itself? Maybe, but layoffs certainly help the bottom line, so why not trim the fat, and cut to the bone. Any employees who get cut will find other jobs within the economy, it is not the bank's responsibility. Change is good, if it makes profits for the bank no matter what the ""human capital"" cost. That is the basic concept, and that is all you need to know.

This is really a fable like story about money, power and temptation. Is the root of all evil due to the love of money? The main character finds out in his new role as CEO. Well-known Greek-French Director Costa-Gravras, best known for ""State of Siege"" in 1972 & ""Z"", is always looking for a deep story of human meaning, and he found a great one again, the age old theme of money and society.

How can you not enjoy a board room of bankers enjoying themselves and mega profits. Dialogue lines like ""I am the new Robin Hood; I steal from the poor and I give more to the rich!"" work well. Money can be sexy, and can also be deadly. Many market and moral angles are tested, and this film stands well on its own. The script is lead by a very well played comedian/actor from France called Gad Elmaleh who switched his lines between English and French dialogue.

This is a well-crafted financial story set in the US & Europe, about corruption, morals and humanity within a sell-side bank dancing with buy-side strings. The hedge fund manager is played by personal favorite Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, (The Usual Suspects) is far from sophisticated. He only enjoys dealing with his ""French Frog Friends"" if it makes him money, otherwise he drops them. This is a more classic tale of temptation, and the moral compass of any man that sometimes loses direction.

The Top 3 Takeaways from this book that really impact any reader are:

1) There is a lot to learn about being a CEO once inside. The politics and pressures are rarely known well by outsiders never in the seat.

2) The impact of a simple economist into a CEO role can be more than expected if given a chance at power. Absolute power, corrupts absolutely!

3) The capital market pressures of investors on financial institutions need to be better understood. Shareholders do own the company in most cases, when the shares go public.

This was not a very widely released film in the US, Europe or Asia, but is now easily found on Netflix, HBO and Amazon services. Highly recommended for its wide appeal for the everyman, no need to worry about any financial product or model names. The lifestyle of the 1% with its personal politics, sex, wealth and luxurious lifestyle no matter how hectic, is showed in vibrant detail. Highly recommended!

8560611,4,B00B1COITK,"Bought it for Gad Elamah comedy but found a good drama with something important to say plus a small amount of comedy.  Plays on stereotypes that French people have but that is not wrong as there have been many films made from American stereotypes that have been really good also.  For Americans, who like light-hearted entertainment this film does come with the original book's thoughts on economics, but don't let that deter you from watching it.
Gabriel Byrne's acting was what gave this only four stars out of four as while I usually love his acting it gave away the storyline much to soon in this film (I'm not sure if it was his interpretation of the script or how he was directed to act or his choice or a combination as all three can lead to a role that comes off wrong).  Gad Elamah is in a role that is so much more serious and the only real comedy is the turn of events at the end however he does a good job as a serious actor in this role (there are small amounts of comedy throughout, Gad is irrepressible like Jim Carey or Robin Williams, but it is definitely toned down).",1514160000,,1085,4.334975369458128
