8158890,4,B000KRNEWE,"I really liked this video.  The cover/info does not say but this is ""salsa styling and spins"". Lots of spins. She also does body roll, chets pop and goes over the basic salsa steps.  If you have done other types of dance the previous will be easy. I have seen another video from salsa crazy and I liked it also.",1279324800,,311,4.166666666666667
8158891,5,B000KRNEWE,"In spite of what some other reviewers have said, this is an excellent instructional dvd if you're trying to learn to dance at home.  The vast majority of what she covers here isn't covered in any real depth anywhere else I've seen, and I have a lot of dance dvds.

I've heard people from some dance schools claim that other schools ""are doing it all wrong"".  I'm not an expert dancer, but I've seen well-seasoned dancers and instructors who dance a whole lotta-lot like Alison does.  Take that for what it's worth to you, but I think she does it well here.

If you're going to learn to dance at home from a dvd, you need to understand how it's going to work.  It's a dvd -- you can rewind and replay a million times, if that's what it takes to get it.  Sure, she could have gone through what she teaches in excruciating detail and slo-mo.  But then, you'd only get two or three steps on a dvd, and she gives a whole lot more on here.

The fact that this dvd contains so much material is one of the reasons I rate it so high.  That said, it's really not the first dance dvd you should be starting out with.  Go get some basic dvds on latin dance (salsa, cha-cha, rumba) and learn those first.  When you come back to this one you'll really appreciate it.

You'd spend hundreds of dollars on private lessons trying to learn what's taught on this dvd.  If you're serious about trying to become a better latin dancer, and like me trying to get beyond the beginner stage, this has lots of good material on it.",1230940800,,1503,4.265017667844523
8158892,1,B000KRNEWE,"I have been a dancer for over 8 years now, and I have started my instructor's training for Ballroom as well. I am always on the lookout for new dvd's that might give new ideas.  However, I received this DVD, put it in my dvd player to make sure it worked, watch about 15 minutes of it, and then went online to print out the return paperwork.  I do not know the dancer on the DVD, I have never seen her on the Salsa or Ballroom scene, and if I ever do I will not be asking her to dance.  The technique she shows is horrid.  How she teaches cuban motion is the way we are taught NOT to do it.  Ballroom people do not dance salsa that way, native latin dancers do not dance salsa that way, in fact the only people I have ever seen move their hips like they show on this DVD are beginner dancers who don't know how to dance yet.  Don't waste your money. There are better dance dvd's both on Amazon and other sites.  I would suggest the New York Style Salsa collection here on Amazon, or if just interested in the body movment, anything by Magna Gopal if you can find it.",1204848000,13,1066,4.0476190476190474
8158893,5,B000KRNEWE,"My wife and I are on this dance kick. We are trying every style of dance that we can get our hands on. We got this Spins DVD and thought it was excellent! I wasn't sure what I expected, but I knew that I would want to feel like I had mastered a skill by the time we finished with this DVD. Well, I am proud to say that I can spin with the best of them (in my family anyway!). It takes a little while getting used to spotting, but once you are able to do that, you are on your way. My wife likes the way that it feels when you finally get ""control"" and are able to execute the moves smoothly. She's very proud of the progress that we have both made. We highly recommend!!",1201564800,,670,3.86231884057971
8158894,5,B000KRNEWE,"I had learned basic Latin dances, but always felt a little awkward. After practicing with this DVD, though, I FEEL sexy and smooth when I dance. Even salsa dancing in my living room is fun with this DVD, which breaks down the movements that are vital to good form in salsa dancing. I would have considered myself a decent Latin dancer before practicing with this video, but I really think the techniques taught and practiced on this DVD are helping me quickly become a ""good"" dancer!",1200960000,,483,4.627906976744186
8158895,3,B000KRNEWE,"Things I like about this DVD:

1. It shows you dance and body movements from basics to more advanced styling technique.

2. Good contents.

Things that I think can be improved:

1. The instructor is facing you the whole time. It's hard to mimic the moves and steps when she is the opposite of you. It would be great to film her from her back so it's easier to see exactly what the steps are.

2. The voice recording isn't very good. There are times when I can hear her pretty well but other times I had to turn up the volume in order to hear her voice clearly.

3. I feel that the spinning techniques can be elaborated more. She showed all kinds of spins in salsa but did not really get into the details of how to practice and perfect your spin.",1173830400,7,745,4.138888888888889
