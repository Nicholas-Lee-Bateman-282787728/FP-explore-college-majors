8254524,5,B0014675SO,"I'm not one to memorize favorite lines in movies, but this appears to be the theatrical movie that I fell in love with.  Based on bad reviews of the currently, widely available ""director's cut,"" I ordered this DVD, and I wasn't disappointed.  It does play in my player in the US, and it is an English soundtrack (with Korean subtitles).  My seller, NET MEDIA SERVICE, seems especially conscientious; the movie arrived with instructions as to how to find the English soundtrack, although that didn't seem necessary in this case.  It IS a relatively low-budget ""early work"" of the Coen brothers (their first movie), but I'll call this an effective dark, suspenseful drama with the type of comedic overtones that make you giggle in horror; you know that type!
