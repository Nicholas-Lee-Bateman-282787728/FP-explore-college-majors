5667048,2,B00BQRBBHC,"A movie about the web and marriage is certainly timely, but this movie moves slowly without one developing any feelings for the characters. The ending, as another reviewer wrote, feels like a high school project.",1393286400,,212,5.085714285714285
5667049,3,B00BQRBBHC,"The story of a married couple in crisis who seek meaning in the arms of others. Not a great film, but worth a look. Someone explain the ending to me if you do...",1393286400,,161,3.909090909090909

5667051,1,B00BQRBBHC,"Poor story; no real content and to fallacy in the story is too obvious.

Can see how this might have been a project for a high school film class.",1390348800,,145,4.0

5667053,5,B00BQRBBHC,This movie touched on something that is happening a lot in this world at the moment yet people never want to talk about it or admit it. I enjoyed how the topic of adultery was addressed as it was portrayed in such a realistic way and didn't cheapen anything or make it look dirty. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anybody its really interesting and a good watch.,1377216000,8,387,4.388888888888889
5667054,5,B00BQRBBHC,"If you're into art movies you'll love this. The acting is great and story really interesting!  If you've ever been in a long term relationship I recommend seeing it, it's really good.",1365292800,4,183,4.71875
8572789,3,B00BQRBBHC,"A good movie that could have been  better. Christine Tizzard who appeared in the last two Jessie Stone episodes is a very underrated actress.  Because of her fine performance and the fact the movie is based on a very good story line, people who cheat on their spouses may find out how much marriage and family mean to them when they start to lose it. They discover what is truly meaningful to them. The ending of the moving was confusing and leaves viewers uncertain as to the future of the characters. What was the end result of the spouses cheating on each other? Because of the way the moving ended, it is impossible to know.",1424822400,,628,4.452173913043478
8572790,4,B00BQRBBHC,"This is a good movie that could have been better in more adequately defining the objective of the wife in seeking  what she felt she was missing and needed in an adulterous relationship. With the husband it's clear, at least in the beginning, that for him it's about sex.with the wife we are given the impression that she seeks those more intangible aspects of romance and a relationship which she is no longer experiencing with her husband. But then things get confusing. Clearly the husbands affair is clearly sexual at first. Later, after he ends his affair, it becomes clear that he seeks some of the same things we are led to believe motivates his wife to cheat. The wife on the other hand enjoys a sexual relationship that  strongly suggests to us that sex plays a far more important role than we were led to believe. She has a sexual afternoon where she engages in not one, but 3 separate actions of heavy duty sex.  . Later we see that  their positions have deviated in that he is more like her and she is more like him.......this should have been made more clear with more visual evidence in more scenes of her sexual tryst, showing her change of interest to sex. It's somewhat disingenuous tomshow sexual scenes of the husbands affair, but little of the wife. I'm sure this was the directors way of trying to be consistent with the main characters objectives in cheating in the first place. If that's true, why have the wife having 3 sexual incidents with the same man in  a single day? This could have been done tastefully but with some degree of honesty to the movie. ...... At the end, he seeks out from his web mate those things that his wife was originally seeking. I'm not so sure what the wife was seeking. There are additional clues I won't go in to which show her transformation to a sexual emphasis.......... I hope I haven't spoiled anything for future viewers, but I think you would probably come to the same conclusion. I enjoyed the movie",1415491200,,1962,4.546742209631728
8572791,3,B00BQRBBHC,"Interesting movie...moved at a slow pace.  I enjoyed the little twist and turns, but overall it left a few unanswered questions.",1413158400,,128,5.095238095238095
8572792,5,B00BQRBBHC,"An authentic treatment of very real to life dynamics in a troubled, yet ultimately sound marriage.  Both protagonists were treated fairly in both their strengths and their flaws.  A very human and accessible tale.  I would have loved to see the ending drawn out more, but absolutely understand the storytelling choice made here.  I take it as an indication of my interest in the characters and their ultimate resolution.  Definitely worth seeing!",1410220800,,446,5.138888888888889
8572793,4,B00BQRBBHC,"This movie is extremely ill-rated. Everyone seems to have such harsh feelings towards the film- and I think those feelings are largely based on its brutal honesty.

This film follows Fred and Deb, a married couple who- after seven years of marriage have their feelings for each other quickly fleeting. The movie starts with Deb, talking in an online chat with a man named works2much. This is how the story starts. She's already been having this 'social affair' with this online mystery man for quite some time, and each of them are unhappily married.

As the story goes on, you learn that Fred is also unhappily married. Both Fred and Deb eventually turn to the online dating world, signing into sites dedicated to married people looking to discreetly have sex with other married people. The story follows them as they venture into the unknown realm of cheating, using the internet as their guide for doing so. The movie covers a lot of issues entailed with online dating including the ever-so-prevalent prostitution associated with online dating sites, as well as safety factors including 'stalkers'.

This movie is for adults only. Much of the subject matter that is covered is very mature, including sex scenes and some minor violence (but the violent act portrayed has major undertones not suitable for younger audiences). I'm twenty-two. I'm not married. But I've been in the same relationship for four years- not necessarily happily, just sort of trucking along. That's why this movie caught my attention. I don't cheat. It's not something I do, but delving into other people's experiences was one that I found fascinating.

The acting was decent. No where near on par with the professional quality you'd get from multi-million dollar productions, but it was easy to watch. There were only one or two moments where I felt the actors were less-than-stellar. But for the most part they held themselves very well. The movie is scripted rather seriously, but Deb's single women-loving brother adds in some comedy with humorous banter that lightens the overall seriousness of the film.

A lot of people writing reviews seem to simply hate the storyline and are judging the entire production on the fact the movie portrays a pretty realistic issue in modern American society- the act of online cheating with married couples. If you're not the kind of person who is interested in seeing two people experience a rough relationship (that doesn't necessarily end happily), then obviously choose another film. But if you're looking for an honest, true-to-the-times movie with realistic characters, take a glance at this one.

Both characters are likable and hate-worthy at the same time. Neither are the bad guys, but neither are the good guys either. That's what makes this movie so remarkable. You're not necessarily forced to pick sides, you're just watching as a bystander. You don't need to love one character over the other, you can feel for them both equally. And that's a brilliant trait to have in a film with a lot of negative undertones. You get to watch, maybe judge, but you're not necessarily forced to pick sides. I really loved that.

The true reason I rated this movie four stars rather than five involves SPOILERS:

The first reason is that Fred, the husband, seems to have these 'visions' throughout the film- where he is imagining things. But there is no real transition between these visions and the current time, which makes everything really confusing. I kept being like ""Wait- is this real, or is this just Fred's imagination?"" It made for a lot of questioning moments in the film.

The second reason is- as other people have mentioned, the ending. It left me hanging. And I know that was the intent of the film. They were trying to mimic other storylines out there that end on a 'thoughtful' note. But this storyline wasn't fit to be stopped at this point. They needed to move it a bit further. They ended on a rise of the conflict, which was just a weird spot to exit the film. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth. But I had to remind myself, that overall the film was very watchable. Not a five-star view, probably more of a 3.5. Four stars is a little generous, but it is worth the watch.

P.S Anthony Cortese (Fred) is such a cutie! He kept me admiring the entire time. And handsome men always make romance movies a bit more interesting to watch.",1407628800,,4375,4.813581890812251
8572794,3,B00BQRBBHC,This movie was worth watching. It is an interesting take on cheating. And like always the best friend is the most exciting character in the whole movie. There were also some really funny parts in the movie.,1405036800,,206,4.594594594594595
8572795,1,B00BQRBBHC,I did not even finish it.  Very slow and boring.  The wife got on my nerves.  Not sure if this was a drama or a comedy.,1399075200,2,119,3.5
8572796,3,B00BQRBBHC,Not at all impressed with this film- acting so-so..husband is as shallow as they come and wife should be more assertive.,1398643200,3,120,4.761904761904762
8572797,3,B00BQRBBHC,"If you are about to get married or planning to in the future this film is perfect for you! Everyone that marries could never see this type of thing happening to them, but it happens all the time! Adults being so irresponsible! Sometimes putting themselves in unforeseen danger! Forgetting everything they know about safe sex! Failing to consider how it affects the children they have together! What about the financial aspect of a split? Fortunately in this film our couple beat the odds, but I'm happiest for their son!",1398384000,,520,4.853932584269663
8572798,1,B00BQRBBHC,"A waste of time, could have been washing my car.
There was nothing about this movie to discuss, just skip it and you can spend the time instead doing anything more fulfilling.",1397692800,,175,4.5
