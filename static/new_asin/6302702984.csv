7829651,5,6302702984,"I love Tiny Toons, and I love this vhs. I grew up with Tiny Toons, and even though I am in my mid 20's now, I still watch these films (I went on a Tiny Toons kick and bought literally every vhs I could find on amazon) even though I am in my twenties. They aren't just for kids. They are for people who like cartoons. But, if you have children, they would love these too. It is much better than cartoons today, where everybody has super model bodies, make up, and act like elementary school hookers. TV has really gone downhill since I was a kid. So I reccomend purchasing this for yourself or your child. Its hilarious, its good old fashioned wholesome fun, and it is sooo nineties. I love the nineties, so I consider this a good thing. Back when kids in middle school didn't wear makeup and pushup bras. Back before they started pushing sex appeal on our youth. Take a stand, watch Tiny Toons.",1343347200,,894,4.295857988165681
7829652,5,6302702984,I loved the tinytoon adventures when i was little but when they stopped airing on tv i felt so bad for a week because it was my favorite show to watch afterschool everyday.it`s about these cartoons that go to the loonaversity school and have many adventures there in this video there are two episodes one is promise-her anything which when buster really wants to got to the dance with babs but when he finally he does and he doesn`t know how to dance so he picks up a few movie from bugs. The second episode is called thirteensomething which is based on the real television series thirtysomething. Which is when buster and babs argue which pushes babs to the limit of quitting the tinytoon show but don`t worry everything turns out good in the end!

7829654,5,6302702984,"This tape features two episodes, ""Prom-ise Her Anything"" and ""thirteensomething"", two of the better episodes in the entire series.
""Prom-ise Her Anything""(dir. Ken Boyer) is the story of the ACME Looniversity Junior Prom that takes over the minds of the inhabitants of ACME Acres. The toons are paired off, and the most obvious pairing, Buster & Babs, seems to have hit a snag... all in all the animation is the C team animation for the most part, squash and stretch rubberbands, but the gags are fun, if not the most original.
""thirteensomething""(dir. Jon McClenahan) a clever blend of 'thirtysomething' and 'Beverly Hills 90210' that starts with the opening credits, makes you feel like you missed the station break. An argument between Buster and Babs has Babs leave the show to find her way in a Prime Time melodrama called 'thirteensomething', the only drawback being the show only hires humans, no toons. This animation is the other 'A-List' animation I loved on this show, almost ANIME in its' renderings. A further trademark of this animation team are frequent profiles, awesome voice synch, and a greater sense of the ""fourth wall"",(or absence of).
This is one of the MUST HAVE Tiny Toons tapes, up there with the Music Television and How I Spent My Summer Vacation tapes. Few episodes are as fun to watch as ""thirteensomething"", the episode that shoots fun at everything, incuding itself.",1023494400,7,1398,5.0042918454935625
7829655,4,6302702984,"This tape features the episodes ""Two-Tone Town"" and ""Fields of Honey"".
 The first episode, ""Two-Tone Town""(dir. Ken Boyer), introduces you to the concept that all of the black-and-white Wanrer Bros. characters who DID NOT make the transition from B&W to color are in fact still around... just unemployed. This episode features the top-line animation that is used in ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" and the opening titles of Tiny-Toons, Animaniacs, and Freakazoid. These guys had the better budget and packed more detail into each frame than many other episodes. It also seems that the voice track is in better synch than ""B"" and ""C"" team episodes.
 The second episode, ""Fields of Honey""(dir. Ken Boyer), begins with Babs having some kind of identity problem that quickly turns into a ""Field of Dreams"" parody/tribute. The episode begins with ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" type animation... all squash and stretch, then transitions into the more standardized format seen in most episodes. It looks like it was produced by two different animation crews, then edited together. Not as ""A-List"" as the first episode, but still very fun to watch.
 On the whole the tape is a good buy if you were not able to burn tapes archiving the episodes yourself. Good quality copies of this show are not easy to find, so until Time Warner/AOL starts moving these over to DVD format, I'll be picking up every tape I can..",1017360000,11,1399,4.919491525423729
