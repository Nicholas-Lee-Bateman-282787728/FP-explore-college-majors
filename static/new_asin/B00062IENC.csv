2159951,5,B00062IENC,"When I first picked up the DVD ""Fabric of a Man"" off the shelf at my local video store I was very skeptical about it; simply because I have seen other ""live performance"" plays and was very unimpressed. The actors were either too inexperience or trying too hard to win over the audience, or the sound, lighting or camera angles were bad.
With ""Fabric of a Man"", David Talbert proved that he was a cut above the rest! Bravo! From the very first scene with Orlando to the last minute, I was utterly captivated. The entire cast was spectacular. The script relays so many messages in an ordered and articulate manner.
I enjoyed it so much that I watched it 5 more times then went out and bought my own copy.
Since then, I have made it my life's passion to collect every piece of artistic work that David Talbert delivers.

Right On, David. 10 Stars!!!",1147910400,6,846,4.423076923076923

2159954,5,B00062IENC,"Creativity and excellence flow in abundance in this marvelous stage play filmed live in Los Angeles, with an exuberant, brilliant cast. Written, directed and produced by David E. Talbert, as part of the Soul Theater Series, ""The Fabric of a Man"" is a romantic comedy with a sparkling, often hilarious script, and lots of music. It has God at its core, the choices we make in life as its theme, and a dash of sauciness, a combination that is a delight, as well as having an honesty that is quite true to life. The plot revolves around Dominique, a strong woman who believes in her own talent and has a passion for her work, and her dilemma in choosing 1 out of the 2 men in her life. Her beau, Blair, a self-centered but successful stock broker, who wants her to put her career on the back burner, and a handsome young man with a good heart and lots of potential. They make her examine what is truly important in life, and discern truth from appearances.

The fabulous cast:

Tammy Townsend is gorgeous and wonderful as Dominique. Known for her work on television, this is Tammy's debut as a stage actress, and she is impressive.

Darrin Dewitt Hensen is Joshua, the young man who works in a dry cleaning store. Darrin is terrific, and is a sculpted, incredible specimen of the human race.

Clifton Powers is Blair, Dominique's beau. Clifton's comedic timing and polished performance is a marvel.

Orlando Wright is Orlando, Dominique's gay assistant, and he is priceless.

Buddy Lewis is Ray, Joshua's boss, who loves the color orange. It's a quirky, very funny part, and Buddy plays it to the max.

Kitra Williams is Ernestine, the big woman with an even bigger heart. Her 2nd scene with Ray is a gem!

Cedric Ford is Reverend Majors, Dominique's father, who is a lovable, big bear of a guy.

Leslie ""Big Lez"" Segar has a laugh-out-loud scene in the 1st few minutes of the play, and also did some of the choreography.

Robbie Lewis wrote the score, with songs by Brent Jones, and the ingenious set design, representing the Fulton Avenue area of Brooklyn, is remarkable. DVD extras include a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, where one can see how the famous shower scene was done, and film commentary by David Talbert, who deserves the highest praise for this superb production. Total running time is 150 minutes.",1133136000,16,2312,4.672413793103448
2159955,5,B00062IENC,"The Fabric of a Man is one of David Talbert's best musical stage plays. It's the story of Dominique (Tammy Townsend - Family Matters, she played Eddie's girlfriend Greta), an up and coming fashion designer who thinks she is in love with Blair Godfrey (Clifton Powell), a self-centered stockbroker who wishes she'd focus less on her career and more on him.  Her father is a minister and she has stopped going to church to concentrate on her career and boyfriend.  Even though everyone tells her he is no good for her, she makes excuses for his behavior.

Dominique's employee (Buddy Lewis)forgot to take the dry cleaning to the cleaners and her regular cleaners is closed, she accidentally stumbles into an old-school dry cleaner, where she meets Joshua King (Darren DeWitt Henson - Soul Food), who has similar career goals.  Joshua is a devout christian who doesn't make a move without God, their first date was dinner and church.

Dominique can't make up her mind about who's better for her, Blair who represents finance or Joshua who will give her the best of both worlds; love and a chance to explore her career goals.  Dominique is forced to decide which man/fabric wears best on her.",1126742400,23,1188,4.799019607843137

It lets the ladies know that just because its not wrapped in the ""correct"" package doesn't take away from its worth. Ladies give men a chance, just because he may not be the ""perfect one"" on the outside, get to know him and he may even suprise you.

2160184,4,B00062IENC,"David E. Talbert's Fabric of a Man is loaded with funny moments, a well-chosen cast and well-written script. Anyone who sees this play will know that Talbert had much to say. The dialogues were so rich they could have gone on for much longer, but you have to know where to cut so that the audience can go home and savor the wonderful presentation. Tammy Townsend delivered effectively in her first stage play. She was believeable as the independent businesswoman Dominique who finds herself in a not-so committed relationship with Blair (Clifton Powell) just as she encounters a young, up-and-coming tailor/designer Joshua King (Darrin Dewitt Henson).
Enough can't be said about Henson. His character is refreshingly supportive, empowered/empowering and definitely an easy treat on the eyes in this play. Henson and Townsend's characters try to play coy but eventually get to a transparency the audience pushes for by the end.
""Fabric"" is a wonderful selection for anyone who still believes that African-Americans have significant, intelligent stories to tell. I would recommend it for anyone who longs for a decent, grounded form of entertainment.",1218758400,,1148,5.278688524590164
2160185,5,B00062IENC,"I enjoyed the play, it had good acting and a great storyline with good moral value...and the romance without vulgarity was nice to see...... I would like to see more plays like this.",1214956800,,182,4.545454545454546
2160186,4,B00062IENC,"I once heard ""What good is a man in a fancy car, if he ain't going anywhere"". Dominique had to decide between Blair the stock broker, aka the man in the fancy car who was so stuck on himself and what SHE could do for him that he couldn't see HER true needs, therefore he wasn't truly going anywhere with her. And then there was Joshua King aka King Joshua, he works at a dry cleaner and working towards becoming a fashion designer. He still in his ""training season"" but definitely cut from the right fabric. He believes in God, goes to church, and he believes in Dominique, something Blair never did. This play is a true testimony of all that glitter aint gold.",1210204800,,661,4.338709677419355
2160237,5,B00062IENC,This is a very well written play.  I never would have thought to compare the characteristics of a man with the threads that make fabric and then connect them to the bible. I have watched this play over and over and each time I've learned something new.,1204243200,,252,4.361702127659575

With my busy schedule, I don't get the chance to get to the theaters, therefore, being able to pop in a DVD and get the same effect is wonderful.  This play was about never letting anyone make you feel you can't be successful and live out your dreams.  It was about having someone who loves you, to support you and if they don't, let them go.  It was a wonderful, inspiring play and I highly recommend it.",1202256000,,438,4.240963855421687
2160239,5,B00062IENC,"I was flipping the channels and started watching it on BET. The cast was fantastic and the acting was really good. I found myself laughing and in awe of the kind of man Joshua was. What a man, what a man! The writing was awesome and touches your heart. This play may me think about my dreams. What God has for me, it is for me. We must not forget about him, because we can have our own plans, but God has the final say so. I'm going to buy this play and show it to all my girlfriends.",1201392000,2,484,3.898989898989899

2160243,3,B00062IENC,"This stage play originally starred Shemar Moore of Criminal Minds, Birds of Prey, The Young and the Restless, the Alaye calendar series.

Darrin DeWitt Henson does a pretty good job of carrying his own, but the play is so rife with stereotypes that I give it 3 stars because of Henson and Mari Morrow, who is so underrated. See her in Divas with Khalil Kain.",1166572800,4,358,4.507692307692308

2160245,4,B00062IENC,"Excellent play that i can relate to.  Not overly romantic but a great story of a selfish man who does not care to see woman to succeed.  This is not a meatless play. One really gets into it. It was well directed. The play shows us many aspects of the main characters life and (family, hopes, and job)and had a great morale about what really makes a man.

2160246,5,B00062IENC,"David Talbert delivers a strong message in this play about choosing a mate not based on what they have materially but what material they are made of.  This is something every man and woman should pay attention to.  Dominque is forced to choose between financial substance and spirtual and emotional substance; she initially makes the wrong choice only to discover that the man she has may not be the man she needs.  The character of Joshua is the type of man any woman waiting on God to send ""the man"" is dreaming of.  This was a great play, with good acting and even better singing.",1154908800,5,583,4.523809523809524
