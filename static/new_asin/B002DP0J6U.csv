3912087,5,B002DP0J6U,"This DVD gives a nice overview of the most beautiful landscapes of these three National Parks in West Canada. The section on ""Glacier"" also show the portion of the Park in the U.S.. Along with the DVD ""Over British Columbia"" (from the air), these 2 DVD's give are a good preparation for your destination. Personally, I used these 2 DVDs in my preparation for a holiday in Western Canada. Both DVDs deal on the basis of beautiful images and music of this beautiful area. I can recommend anyone who wants to get an idea of what this country has to offer.",1344211200,,552,4.475247524752476
3912088,3,B002DP0J6U,"Some nice videography mixed with some ancient videography, came across a little too much like an advertisement where they where trying to sell me something for 19.95 - but it did have some nice parts.",1341446400,,200,4.742857142857143

However, if you're interested in hotels, lodges, and tales of man-made infrastructure, this is the video for you.

I bought this video hoping for the former, but instead got a marketing ploy filled with the later.",1288396800,5,314,4.90566037735849

3912091,2,B002DP0J6U,"In the product description: ""Blu-ray captures like no other format the sweeping beauty and extraordinary natural wonders of America's premier national parks. Filmed and mastered in High Definition, Scenic National Parks takes you off the beaten path to discover untamed places, unique wildlife, and invigorating activities. ...""

Based on this description, I expected shots focused in the backcountry and also some excellent animal shots. However, the film is generally more about history, what people do in the park, and then basically runs a number of advertisements for hotels and restaurants. The film crew focused almost entirely on the most accessible locations, and the only fantastic shots are those made from a helicopter (these are also perhaps the only 1080p-definition shots). The animal sections have an urban feel and appear limited to animals that have made their way to people, either near the road, in a golf course, or near buildings... not exactly mind-blowing work.

I was disappointed to see so many people, lodges, and restaurants in a video purported to be featuring the ""natural wonders"" of the national parks. I expected to see the best locations and most interesting animals in the parks. However, I would estimate that 70% of the film revolves specifically around history and things to do (e.g. interviews with folks, outlines of specific tours, visiting a particular hotel/restaurant, etc.). When there was a nice shot, it was typically short lived.

The only purpose I see this video serving is as a brief introduction to someone planning a trip to one of these parks and who does not want to go into the backcountry via longish day trips or backpacking. This works alright for Banff, which is already rather developed. Jasper is less touched, and its gems are in the backcountry. Hence, this film is not great for Jasper planning; the amazing Athabasca and Skyline Trails are completely omitted. I'm generally unfamiliar with Glacier, and so I cannot say whether this video would be helpful prior to a trip there.",1281139200,10,2043,5.129129129129129

3912093,4,B002DP0J6U,"The two programmes (Glacier and Banff & Jasper) play for 100 mins and follow a similar structure. They both show a little history, briefly interview some influential or knowledgable people from the area, show us inside some of the classy hotels and lodges, demonstrate a number of activities tourists can partake in and most importantly show us the beautiful mountain scenery and wildlife these areas have. Some of the aerial shots are terrific.
Some hiking trails are mentioned and show people on the trail and at some of the backcountry cabins. Most places are filmed on nice days so you get to see how beautiful they really are.

I would personally like to have seen more on the hiking trails and scenery and maybe a bit more on backcountry places most tourists won't ever get to see. The majority of places and activities shown are what most tourists passing through in a few days will see.

I have been to these three areas many years ago and this is a nice souvenir.",1263513600,14,972,4.645348837209302

8365652,1,B002DP0J6U,"When I buy scenic DVD's/Blu Rays, I expect them to show beautiful scenes of what I experience on vacation.  In particular, I prefer some scenes of common tourist stops.  This video has very little of that.  Instead, it is filled with shots of people, railroads, hotels, close-ups of nature, and a lot of bad black and white vintage video.  It has some beautiful shots of mountains from the air.  But only a few fleeting views from popular tourist spots.  Some of the best views only last a second or two.  I honestly do not understand why anyone would give more than 1 star to this blu ray.  I would give it 0 if I could.  I now must decide whether to keep or toss this item.  (I like my home videos of these parks better, even if they are more grainy.)",1422748800,,753,4.276595744680851
