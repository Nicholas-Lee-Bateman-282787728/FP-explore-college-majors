4506474,4,B004Z6N7QE,"I do like this video, but was disappointed that I already owned it.  I purchased it with different packaging simply labeled ""talking hands"" and didn't realize that this video was basically the same one with intervals where a frog appears.  Even so, now I have two.  My 2 year old is learning with this video and is doing better with her speech.",1409961600,,344,4.516129032258065
4506475,5,B004Z6N7QE,My infant grand daughter watched this until she was 1 1/2 years old. She has since moved onto other things but it worked wonders and held her attention for quite awhile. Definitely awakens the little mind growing inside!,1398211200,,220,4.815789473684211
4506476,5,B004Z6N7QE,"I love the video and so does my 10 month old, he doesn't watch any other videos except for this one, he could care less for the other videos I purchased",1380758400,,152,3.935483870967742
4506477,5,B004Z6N7QE,Another great BB product.  Does a great job in covering color and shapes and my 15-month old loves watching it.  The music/songs are great too.,1371686400,,143,4.68
4506478,5,B004Z6N7QE,Excellent introduction to sign language.  My son likes it and I learn a lot each time we watch it.  Highly recommended.,1371686400,,119,4.619047619047619
4506479,5,B004Z6N7QE,"My son loves the brainy baby show!! During this show, we cuddle and have a nice bonding experience. Because of these DVDs, he can say his alphabet, count to ten and knows his shapes... He is only 2!! Highly recommend!",1357603200,,217,4.45
4506480,4,B004Z6N7QE,"A great way to let your child think they are getting TV time while helping with their learning. I use this as a compliment to reading books and one on one learning of her shapes and colours. I am sure there are other similar options out there so I can't say this is the best there is, as I have not experienced the others, but this DVD keeps my nearly two year olds attention by regularly changing pictures, music and presentation throughout the DVD. I also like the fact that it is split into the two separate parts for shapes and colours as she gets her shapes and needs more work on colours, so I can just pick that section from the menu and let her watch it without having to work through all the shapes again - and we all know the attention span of a 23 month old.  Good value and a great compliment to learning.",1345075200,5,817,4.170886075949367
4506481,5,B004Z6N7QE,Brainy Baby Shapes & Colors DVD is one of our favorites and also one of the best videos we have ever purchased.  I also learned that Brainy DVDs were University Tested and proven to teach children 22 times more than other products we tried.  This Shapes & Colors DVD lived up to its research in our home.  I would recommend it to anyone that is teaching your son or daughter basic shapes & colors.  I have bought many for shower gifts and donated my older copies to daycare facilities.  You won't be disapointed in how much your child learns.,1320883200,,542,4.434343434343434
4506482,5,B004Z6N7QE,Excellent DVD for teaching sign language. The best I have found and it really works with kids.  My boys learned right away.. it was amazing!,1320883200,,140,4.6
4506483,5,B004Z6N7QE,"These programs do not overwhelm little ones with endless graphics dancing around the screen. They are calm and kind. It's more like viewers get to visit extended family, who are everday kids playing in fun natural settings with nurturing adults joining in as they would in real life. Multi-ethnic and differently ""abled"" folks are featured on the DVD. Repeats skills showing children (and adults) at different ages and different levels of mastery, in this case using signs for things like ""please"" and ""Grandpa"" and ""drink"" (with a review at the end and extra features of counting to 10 and the alphabet). The viewing child can join in without feeling intimidated. Even if there is no medical need for our own children to sign on an everyday basis, this DVD helps expand their little minds and hands to have another way to talk to loved ones, and expands their little hearts to naturally include those who do sign as beloved playmates and caregivers, as demonstrated in the video.

And you really do want to join in. After my just-turned-2 granddaughter watched their Music DVD, her favorite thing was to urgently hand me 2 wooden blocks to play percussion, and then dash to her bitty piano so I could accompany her baby jazz. She made immediate application to what was available at home. These DVDs are more like imitating siblings and cousins than classroom education. Wonderful.",1320105600,3,1381,4.901709401709402

8449498,3,B004Z6N7QE,"Boring...this really is meant for babies, not toddlers. My two year old wouldn't sit down to watch it.",1507507200,,102,4.722222222222222

8449501,2,B004Z6N7QE,"Purchased this for my 14 mo. old grand daughter who loves the ""MY BABY CAN TALK"" DVD which teaches simple signing and words. It has calming music and has simple visual elements which hold her interest. She will sit and watch the entire DVD and appears to enjoy it. I bought this DVD because it had a good ratings but my grand daughter won't watch it, doesn't hold her interest at all.",1485907200,,384,4.347222222222222
