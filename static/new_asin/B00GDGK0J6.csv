8622345,2,B00GDGK0J6,"Ronald Brautigam is pleasant enough, and gives professional performances of pieces of great piano music from the whole history of classical piano. But the project is tragically marred by the moronic, pretentious and nauseating photography of the director. Jump cuts are almost at an MTV pace - and we are provided with extreme close-ups of hairy knuckles, fingers etc of usually just the pianist's right hand. The photography does not enhance the listening experience in any way - in fact, it detracts from it and only seems to want to push the director's bizarre photography on us. He should go make an experimental, artsy, pretentious film which has nothing to do with music, to get it out of his system, then go back to attempt to film musical performances once again. Very disappointing.",1428537600,3,791,4.954887218045113
