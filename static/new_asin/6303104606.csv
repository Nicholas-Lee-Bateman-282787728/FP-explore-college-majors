7966797,3,6303104606,"This is not exactly what I would call a classic.
I saw it when it was new out in the US and it was one of the only anime at the video store, I had not seen yet.
This anime is plain terrible. So terrible it is laughable, connoisseurs of cheese may savor this. It is something you sit back with a few beers and invent drinking games for.
The anime itself is a Rambo rip off and is as I coined at the time ""filmed in over-drama"". What this means is that any time anything is happening on the screen, you have to stop and ask ""How could this get more dramatic?"", usually whatever you guess would make it more dramatic, happens immediately. Then you stop and ask ""But what could make this even more dramatic?"". You can just keep repeating this process until it is completely ludicrous... and it does get ludicrous.
The hilarity of ""over-drama"" gets the feature 3 stars. The anime itself is firmly a 1 star release, so I do not think we will get a DVD release to enrich out drinking game offerings, for when friends come over.",1361232000,,1020,4.262886597938144
