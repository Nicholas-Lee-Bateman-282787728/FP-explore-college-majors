8328339,5,B001NY6YRK,"I followed Paul Yandell most of his career, from the time he backed up the Louvin Bros. with a thumb pick style that was relentless, even on gospel songs.  I saw him in the 50's with the Louvin Bros. and to me his guitar playing was the highlight of the show.  Then, after stints with Kitty Wells & Johnny Wright and others, Chet Atkins began using him as his right hand man on his live shows.  Paul usually stood or sat on Chet's left and backed Chet.  Some great songs here for you thumb pick fans.",1387756800,,500,4.177083333333333

8328342,5,B001NY6YRK,"For those who are fans of the fingerstyle guitar made famous by Chet Atkins, this DVD is for you.  Paul Yandell toured with Chet Atkins for many years and in this DVD shares some of both his and Chet's stylings.

The video is excellent quality and features Paul Yandell at his best. There is no accompanyment which many times drowns out that short riff that makes other guitar players drool - just simply Paul and his guitar.

For those guitarist who were hoping to pick up some of Chet's noted licks, you may be disappointed.  To that end, I was as I have been playing ""fingerstyle guitar"" for years and was looking forward to seeing exactly how some of his riffs which still escape me were played.  Paul does show how they are played, but does not dissect the fingering for you - either in tab form, slow motion or note by note.  For me, that was disappointing.

Having said that, the DVD is still FANTASTIC and those who love fingerstyle guitar will not be disappointed.  Let's hope Paul decides to produce another.",1244764800,2,1018,4.524590163934426
8328343,5,B001NY6YRK,Outstanding effort from one of the great guitarist of our time. No Chet Atkins or Jerry Reed fan should be without this DVD from the man who composed with and the was right hand man for both of these great guitarists.,1240531200,3,217,4.317073170731708
8328344,5,B001NY6YRK,It's a mystery to my that this man has been unknown to the whole guitar world for all the years he's been around. Sideman for Jerry Reed for about 5 years and 25 years for Chet Atkins. I can only put it as Jerry Reed quoted: No guitar player comes closer to the sound of Chet. And this man can play all of Chets licks and rolls and if you download the booklet you get 8 song incl. tabs and about 30 small lessons from Paul himself. This is a must for every thumbstyle player. Superb.,1234310400,4,483,4.041666666666667
