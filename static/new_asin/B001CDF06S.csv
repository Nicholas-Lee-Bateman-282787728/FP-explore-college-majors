8286876,5,B001CDF06S,I am a great fan of Eric Clapton and have played this DVD a lot.  It covers acoustical guitar to some of his best electrical guitar playing.  I like the choice of songs and the concert must have been a treat to go to as the lighting is fantastic.  He just keeps getting better.  I got the DVD in the mail faster than I expected and paid a fair price.  The quality of picture is very good but could be slightly better.  I would recommend it to anyone from a beginning fan to an old one like me.,1397260800,,493,3.979591836734694
8286877,3,B001CDF06S,"This is a very good performance from Budokan, Tokyo, 2001 during Clapton's Reptile Tour. It's NOT what I ordered, however. It was listed as a 2009 performance, which is what I expected. I already have this 2001 show in my collection. It was originally shown on Japan satellite TV, which explains some reviewers' lukewarm video quality rating as mediocre. This 2001 perfomance is a solid program by Clapton to an appreciative Tokyo audience. It includes an unexpected electric version of Layla near the end of the program in a time when Eric played the acoustic version almost exclusively. You can tell by the audience reaction that this was a treat. Don't buy this, however, if you want the advertised 2009 show. I'm waiting to hear from Amazon if they will exchange or refund me.",1379808000,7,780,4.8283582089552235
8286878,4,B001CDF06S,"First of all Eric and the band rock.  They are great and a must have for Eric fans and the like.  But the picture quality is fuzzy and .the sound is okay.  His vocals at times get static noise and there is not a lot of pop in the sound overall but is it acceptable.  If you are looking for top notch crisp video and sound you will be dissappointed.  But if you can live with pretty good, you will love this concert.  Video rating 6 out of 10 audio rating 7out of 10 and I have very high end equipment.",1377648000,2,501,3.910891089108911
8286879,5,B001CDF06S,Another Sampling of what was an excellent blend of different versions to songs that are well known...He's gotten better with age if that's possible...,1376352000,,150,5.291666666666667
8286880,5,B001CDF06S,Glad we ordered it.  Quality of sound is great.  Songs are great too.  Not sure where we first heard it.,1366761600,,104,4.1
