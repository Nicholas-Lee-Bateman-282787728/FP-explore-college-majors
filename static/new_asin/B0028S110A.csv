3873713,5,B0028S110A,Kudos to Shout to making the seasons available so quickly.  Just got my season 1 and love it.  Keep 'em coming!  Thanks.,1244073600,3,120,4.363636363636363
3873714,5,B0028S110A,"I am so glad they are releasing the second season so quickly after the first season is being released. I sincerely hope that they will continue to release them as quickly as possible.

Season 2 highlights:
Killing all the right people- a controversial episode as the women learn a friend of theirs is dying from AIDS. Very poignant- and informative without being preachy.
Dash Goff, the Writer- we meet another one of Suzanne's ex-husbands (real-life husband, Gerald McRaney). He is a writer who is depressed because his latest book is not being picked up. The girls help him through this by enlisting him to create a book club in part to help Anthony and in part to make Dash feel better about himself.
Stranded- Suzanne and Anthony are stranded in a blizzard in a motel. The antics that ensue are classic Suzanne and Anthony. Funny episode.

Keep the seasons coming- this show is a gem!",1242086400,17,888,4.72258064516129

3873739,5,B0028S110A,Designing Women was not issued by a main studio but instead issued by *'Shout Factory' company. Thanks to them we get to enjoy this great series.  I loved Designing Women when it aired on CBS. Adding Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostly to the ensemble in later seasons was just great. I only watched some episodes of  the last two seasons after changes in the cast. Once you break up the original cast the chemistry is just never the same. This is a great comedy with great Southern women.,1450137600,,486,4.511363636363637

3873753,5,B0028S110A,"One of my favorite shows - EVER!  Ms. Burke, Potts, Smart and Carter were not given the credit for the talent they displayed on this show.
""Golden Girls"" NEVER would have been possible without this show.  WOW - it kinda is this show, only on Medicare.  But I digress.
Designing Women was and is a fantastic show.  It is dated - the 80's hair and clothes show it's age.  But how would ""I Love Lucy"" play today if we hadn't accepted that is what old and in black & white?  What makes a classic?  Great writing?  Great acting?  All of the above?  CHECK!!
Won't lie - Seasons 6-7 could be buried in the New Mexico dump along with the Atari ""ET"" game.  Actually - PLEASE do!!
Other than that - you can't lose with a purchase of this show.",1438041600,,733,4.201438848920863

3873793,4,B0028S110A,"Let me start by saying that ""Designing Women"" is a fantastic show with great storylines and a cast that work perfectly together. Usually with long-running shows, they don't really hit their stride until the second or third season, as is the case here. I couldn't think of a better choice of cast for this show than Annie Potts, Delta Burke, Jean Smart, Dixie Carter and Meshach Taylor.

That being said, there are a number of customer reviews on here talking about defective discs in this set. When mine arrived, there was some kind of a filmy gunk on the back of both discs 3 and 4. I bought mine brand new and sealed, so I know that it was a problem with the company, not from who I bought it from. If you have that problem with this set, I obviously don't suggest popping them right in the DVD player, as they will either skip or not work at all. There are actually a couple of ways to clean the discs and get them to a playable condition. You can use window cleaner and a soft cloth to clean it off, or do what I did and use equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. While my discs didn't get completely clean, I tested both of them and they both work with no skipping or stalling. I know that some people do receive copies of this set and have discs that have no kind of dirt or anything on them, so it's kind of an ""at your own risk"" thing. Some people on here say that they do the cleaning procedures and they don't work even after that, but I would strongly suggest either of those above cleaning methods if you do come across this problem. I went through and cleaned both discs twice just to make sure they would play, and everything was fine. If you don't mind the little bit of extra work cleaning discs that you might get with purchasing this set, it's a good collection to have. As I mentioned, this is when the show was really hitting its stride and the acting and writing were excellent. I highly recommend picking up this fantastic collection for some good laughs and memories.",1393977600,,1990,4.320855614973262

3873795,5,B0028S110A,"""Designing Women"" is one of the truly great television series.  Its substance, style, and wit consistently engage us.  Its truth moves us.

There is the smart and colorful banter in each episode delivered by four brilliant (and incidentally charismatic and beautiful) lead actresses Burke, Carter, Potts, and Smart, with nimble support by Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostley.  The dialogue seems organic to the characters.  The actors render their lines with such deft precision that it's like watching a finely tuned orchestra in peak performance with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason as principal composer and Harry Thomason as alternating conductor so to speak.

So book a front row seat and witness artists who are masters of craft and prolific purveyors of humor and pathos for which we should all be grateful.",1389916800,,806,5.307086614173229

Since we purchased multiple seasons, it took time before we realized that this issue was pervasive throughout all of the boxed sets. Severely disappointing as this was a gift.",1325808000,,347,4.596774193548387
3873830,5,B0028S110A,"Season one, as most first ones have a tendency to be, was a little bit awkward as the creators were trying to figure out where these four lovely ladies were going.  There is Elizabeth Taylor-like beauty queen Suzanne (Delta Burke), her headstrong, elegant, passionate sister Julia (Dixie Carter), sweet as candy country girl Charlene (Jean Smart), and shy with a whole lot of fire underneath Mary Jo (Annie Potts).  New to the season this year is the delightful addition of Meshach Taylor as reformed ex-convict Anthony and  Alice Ghostly as senile but funny Bernice Clifton.

Highlights:

Everyone loves the episode ""Dash Goff the Writer,"" as do I, so I won't even attemp to bore you with more praise of this fantastic piece.

""Anthony, Jr.:""  Anthony shows the total class most guys don't have when confronted with a son he didn't know about...even after he discovers it's not even HIS!

""Killing All the Right People:""  We still need to talk about this topic today as much as back in the late 80s, and this is sadly, painfully clear.  Job well done!

""Howard the Date:""  If you've ever been picked on in high school, this episode will get straight to your heart.

""Oh, Brother:""  On the same theme of being different and getting picked on, Julia and Suzanne go wild when they discover that their brother Clayton, just released from a mental hospital, wants to become a standup comedian.  Anthony, Charlene, and Mary Jo see him as a funny guy, but it will take his sisters some convincing.

""High Rollers:""  I love Suzanne's little ""Name Game"" Consuela song!

""Reservations for Eight:""  Hilarious battle of the sexes on what's supposed to be a relaxing vacation.  The arguments get you laughing at both sides, and it's a great season closer.

I recommend this if you only purchase one season of the show because the humor is sophisticated, the topics are sensitively handled, and it gives the new south the proper respect it deserves. No yee-hawin' hillbillies here!  Also, so sorry about the late, beautiful Dixie Carter.  She will be truly missed.",1306713600,,2051,4.847262247838617

3873834,4,B0028S110A,"Season Two of DESIGNING WOMEN is where the show really starts to soar.  With many all-time fan favourites (""Dash Goff, the Writer"", ""Killing All the Right People"", ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and ""Reservations for Eight"" chief among them), DESIGNING WOMEN's second year also sees the re-introduction of Alice Ghostley, who plays ""just a little off the beam"" Bernice Clifton, a character who'd only appeared in one pivotal show from the first season but truly made an impression on series creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason.  Bernice joins the regular cast for a lot of this season's action.

Dixie Carter is Julia Sugarbaker, the owner of Atlanta design firm Sugarbaker & Associates.  Delta Burke plays her sister, frequently divorced and frequently-crowned former beauty queen Suzanne.  Jean Smart is sweet, naive ""dirtbag magnet"" Charlene Frazier.  And Annie Potts is wry single mother Mary Jo Shively.

""Half An Air Bubble Off"" - Birds of a feather?  Julia decides to hook up their ""eccentric"" new client Lamar Tyson (Elliott Reid) with Bernice, who has just entered herself in the Miss Senior Citizen Pageant.

""Second Time Around"" - Bill and Charlene's relationship hits a brick wall when he reveals that he cannot accept Charlene's love whilst still grieving his first wife's passing.

""Oh, Brother"" - Julia and Suzanne welcome their half-brother Clayton (Lewis Grizzard) back from his latest stint in the mental institution, and attempt to get him a job; completely oblivious to what he has a genuine talent for.

""Reservations for Eight"" - The girls head off for a skiiing weekend with their respective boyfriends, but when they become snowed-in at the resort, the atmosphere becomes heated with a Men versus Women debate led by Julia and Reese.",1284854400,,5916,5.077559462254395
3873835,4,B0028S110A,"Don't get me wrong - 'Designing Women' season 2 is good. It has some of the series' classic episodes including ""Killing All the Right People"" where one of the gang's male friends reveals he has AIDS and wants them to be the designers of his ideal funeral; ""I'll Be Seeing You"" where Charlene has a World War II dream/fantasy sequence; and ""How Great Thou Art"" where Julia worries over a big solo as Charlene feels conflicted when her pastor lets it be known that he feels women shouldn't be reverends and pastors in the church. When compared to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Designing-Women-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001O4KBNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Designing Women: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;however, this season feels a bit stifled. There are fewer of Julia's usual ""Terminator"" and iconic speeches; there aren't as many memorable scenes and fewer overall laugh-out loud moments. Is it bad though? No, there's still a lot to like about the second season and the series itself holds up well even after all this time and doesn't at all feel old or dated.

The Good: If there's anything to like about the second season is that it delves more into defining each character beyond what you saw in the first season. The first season was more of an introduction to the entire series and the characters and it feels as if season 2's mission was to reveal more about the characters. Julia, always known for her iconic speeches and unapologetic liberal feelings, is shown to be sensitive, softer and even critical of herself throughout the season; Charlene, known for her outlandish stories and down-home vibe, gets put through the emotional ringer as she enters into a relationship that has its ups and downs; Mary Jo deals with everything from her own personal biases and prejudices to trying to deal with her ex husband and new love; Suzanne ... is still Suzeanne for the most part but with her ex husband and money woes, she too goes through some growth. In addition to the women, there's the men in their lives that are prominently featured throughout the season. This adds a new dimension to the show, especially in the final episode of the season where you get to see a great Men vs. Women battle take place. While the season was light on truly memorable speeches or iconic scenes, the show did a great service to the series overall by taking a season to really develop the characters and flesh them out more.

The Bad: Something just felt 'off' about this season. I've seen every episode of the show on television but now am re-watching the series via DVD releases. Season one felt like a non-stop laugh fest with a lot of thought-provoking dialogue. This season felt scaled back or restrained in a way. I laughed still but there were fewer moment huge series moments in the second season and outlandish antics in this season. I've already started&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Designing-Women-Season-Three/dp/B0030ATZH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Designing Women: Season Three</a>and the first few episodes feel as if they are back to the season one level of comedy mixed with strong dialogue and scenes that you're likely to find in a ""best of"" retrospective. It's odd, but season 2 just feels as if it was setting out to accomplish something different from the first and third seasons. I also wasn't crazy about the DVD transfer of some of the video. Some of it looks more like a VHS recording than something for DVD display. Another area that I felt was lacking was a bonus feature of some kind. I don't understand why so many television DVD releases these days are opting to skip out on bonus content or features but it would have been nice to have some director/creator commentary or a snippet or two from the cast discussing some of the season's episodes.

In all, even with the flaws and bad points of the release, this series remains one of television's classics and often underrated shows. If you're a fan of shows like 'The Golden Girls' or today's 'Desperate Housewives' then this show should of course be of great interest to you. It's entertaining and great to have a show that features four strong, smart (yes, even Delta Burke's Suzanne has her moments), strong female leads. Great acting, some good dialogue and situations that are never low brow or demeaning.",1283558400,,4387,5.090277777777778

3873844,5,B0028S110A,"I adore DESIGNING WOMEN.  I was glued to it every week when it originally aired.  This show is a modern day classic and so deserves to be on dvd.  I must also say that for me the true spirit of what is DESIGNING WOMEN only exists in the seasons that had the original 4 women.  The later years whether funny or not were just attempts to keep a diamond shining and it never measured up.

But here we are with Season 2 which is just when the show started to hit its true stride.  I made sure to watch the entire season before writing this review and the memories it brought up and the laughs and tears provided were a truly welcomed gift.  DESIGNING WOMEN had a unique ability of tackling current issues while at the same true providing truly believable characters and laughs galore.  Season 1 was great but it was the beginning.  The women were introduced and wes saw the unique characters they each possessed but the issue episodes did at times get a little preachy.  They were still great but sometimes a little in your face.

That has all calmed down in Season 2 and the issues are still runing rampant but the way they are dealt with got very clever.  Julia (Dixie Carter) aka the terminator is the most outspoken and opinionated.  Mary Jo (Annie Potts) is the meek and shy one who is struggling with day to day family life but still has opinions, Charlene (Jean Smart) the fun loving rather ditzy one with the heart of gold and Suzanne (Delta Burke)  the self centered beauty queen who could go from wisdom to clueless in a snap.  With these four unique women issues could be introduced and with their diverse personalities debates could be had and issues could be dealt with hardcore but there would always be laughs and an attitude that would leave the viewer with the right to form their own opinion.

But most important is the true immense talent of the 4 ladies and all of the characters are hugely developed over season 1.  You love these women and will laugh with them, cry with them and just wish they were in your life.  There are some definite standout episodes here - KILLING ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE, about Aids - CRUISING, a comedic tour de force - I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS, a magical heartfelt episode - THERE'S SOME BLACK PEOPLE COMING TO DINNER, about racism.  My favorite is HIGH ROLLERS.  Delta Burke as Suzanne made the biggest transformation in this season as they made her character more the comedic part.  And she rose to the occasion.  The way she spoke every line had you in stitches and she could have you in tears of laughter or tears of emotion.  When she was funny she was hilarious but her tender moments were memorably heartfelt.  This episode is the truest introduction to how much she would shine even more in future seasons.

All four women shine here.  This is the unique combination of great acting, chemistry, writing where pure magic happens.  If you love this show you will love it more the second time around on dvd and if you are new to it - give yourself a treat.  This is tv at its best and I can honestly say it is in no way dated.  This is comedy at its finest.

Bring on season 3 !!!",1255996800,18,3129,4.400696864111498
3873845,5,B0028S110A,I really enjoyed the Designing Women series. I sure I will be watching it several more times.  I highly recommend it.,1254528000,,117,4.571428571428571
3873846,5,B0028S110A,"Those Southern women are at it again. Designing women has been one of my favorite if not THE favorite show  that have ever been on TV. I always wished I had Julia's grit, and Suzannes cutting wit. Season two doesn't disapoint. I love that Charlene is finding her true love, and only hope the Shout factory  puts out seasson 3 soon, so that we can see the love story play out. Some of the best stories are in that year.
  In season 2 the actors seem to find their comfort level with the characters, especially Suzanne. She is no longer the rather timid air-head. And Anthony just gets better and better. The only character I'm not crazy about is Mary Jo. I wish they had dressed her differently. sometimes she looks like a gypsy. She seems to be trying too hard.
  The writing on these shows is so crisp and the dialogue is outstanding. If it were only so today. The shows that come out today are written by people who have very little grasp of the language, and therefore subsitute action or violance or sex in place of good writing. And the humor is non existant.

I am so hyped that they have finally released Seasons One and Two on DVD as I have purchased both and love them both. I'm eagerly awaiting the remaining seasons. Although I must admit my favorite seasons are the ones that have both the Sugarbaker women in them.

I guess I have to do another review for Season One. Maybe I can just copy paste this one.

My favorite episode of Season Two is the one where she sees How Great Thou Art. It meant even more to me when she told us from the special episode of Season Two where they are all reunited it was the last time her mother got to see her sing before she died.
