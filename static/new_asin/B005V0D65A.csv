It comes as two separate plastic boxes with the discs in sleeves, stacked in the center, like other Mill Creek products. So no fancy packaging here. Video quality varies but is mostly good. Good transfers though.

WWII: The war that Changed the world. 11 DVDs

The first two series Dawn of War and The Fight for Freedom, are actually one huge series called The Finest Hours of the Second World War divided into two parts. It's in English but produced in Spain apparantly. The narrator speaks perfect English but the script seems to be translated from spanish so the sentence structure and some pronuciations are kind of distracting. You can kind of get used to it after a while but it remains a distraction. (For the reader's information, not meant as an insult.) Still it's a huge series and very detailed and contains a lot of stock footage. 4 DVDs 21 episodes at 52 minutes each.

The next one is The War in the Pacific (possibly also called Crusade in the Pacific)
An older series. A step by step description of the pacific war with a brief description of each battle and stock footage from both sides, a lot that I haven't seen before. Pretty good. 2 DVDs 10hrs

Hitler: The Untold Story divided into three parts on 3 DVDs.
part 1 Hitler: Anicdotes, Myths and Lies
Another spanish production about WWII told with focus on Hitler's actions. Again, a lot  of stock footage. It seems to run chronologically but ends up being sort of all over the place. I didn't think it was that good. Note: This DVD makes my DVD players buzz for some reason. 6 episodes 55min each

part 2 The world at War: Hitler to Hiroshima
Covers WWII, both in Europe and the Pacific theaters. There is some unique footage but it's mostly the same old stuff. This series doesn't really add much to the collection. 4 parts about 3.5hrs

part 3 U-Boats: Hitler's Sharks a three hour, three part series. The history of the U-Boats. It's okay for what it is. I've seen a lot of stuff about the U-Boats already so was not too impressed.

The last WWII series is WWII Remembered: A Complete History aka The History of World War II. A 10 part series on 2 DVDs using post war newsreels to tell about WWII. Sort of random but still a pretty good series. 2 DVDs 10 parts 10 hrs. Note: The second DVD also makes my DVD players buzz.

That was Nam. 9 DVDs

That was Nam 13 episodes 4.5hrs
Shows about various aspects of the war, supply, the navy, doctors etc.

Airpower: Vietnam to Desert Storm 1hr
note: You have to play this using Play All. If you play it separately the last 10 minutes get cut off for some reason.

Vietnam War Stories 11 episodes, approx. 4.5 hrs.
Interviews with Vietnam veterans. There's also a few WWII and Korean War vets mixed in.

Brothers in Arms Stories of the 101 Airborne in Vietnam. (45 min)

A couple of shows called Trial by Ordeal. One is about the 1st Cavalry and one the USS Forrestal fire. Both very good but way too short. They run about 45 minutes together.

Shadow Warriors almost 2hrs
The story of shadow warriors with interviews with LRRPs, rangers, green berets and others. Some overlap with other shows of this collection.

Vietnam - America's Conflict
A massive 23 hour 4 DVD documentary collection made up of over 50 short shows, usually about a half hour long. They are pretty much a mixed bag of everything MillCreek has left on Vietnam. And they are complete propaganda. But then they are made by the government and the military so they would be. Some are even hosted by stars like John Wayne and ironically, Henry Fonda. Entertaining enough and a ton of footage I haven't seen before. Some are very good. This part is also available separately.

I know this isn't a very good review and it's pretty sloppy but it takes a long time to watch 90 hours of videos and take notes and try to keep the length down. Sorry for the mess. I hope it helps at least. It's a decent collection but amazon's price has gone up and I'm not sure it's worth the current $45. A good addition to or a good start of a military documentary collection. It's not World at War quality but is mostly rewatchable, you know, whenever you have 90 hours to spare.",1352851200,10,4360,4.653645833333333
