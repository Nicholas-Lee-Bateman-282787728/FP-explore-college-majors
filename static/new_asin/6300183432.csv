217606,3,6300183432,"OK, so you definitely have to be a fan of the 1980's pop star, Rick Springfield.  Don't expect it to be anything more than his signature music, soap opera acting, and a predictable rock star falls in love with your  average but intelligent career woman storyline.  Use the hour and half or  so to sit back and be entertained in a way only a true Rick Springfield fan  can appreciate and you'll be good to go!",913161600,2,408,4.315789473684211

217834,2,6300183432,Rick Springfield is very watchable obviously but this movie fell short of expectations. The supporting cast didn't fit. The quality of screenplay was very limited.

217978,4,6300183432,"Saw this movie in the theater when it was released. Loved the concert footage in it. I have seen Rick in concert 3 times,(and met him once) and kind of bummed that I'm not going to again this year. This movie reflects how a rock star can be as everyday as you and I (in a sense)!! I find it refreshing that I could watch a movie about a rock star and not have to sit thru their political mumbo jumbo. Maybe kinda cheesy in this day and age. The movie basically shows a flamboyant rock star who gets a reality check when he falls for an everyday woman. And the storyline is about how it all clashes. When Rick leaves a stadium of over 18,000 screaming fans to go catch her at an airport, it is alot like an officer and a gentleman scene.",1327104000,,736,4.082758620689655

217980,3,6300183432,"Ok...there wasn't much to this movie but Rick did a fine job. I found it entertaining and just fun. I was actually able to get a copy of the ""original"" script and believe me the original ""Hard to Hold"" was MUCH better...it would have been a solid movie but of course they destroyed it in the editing room so they could get a ""PG"" rating...so sad. It was said they didn't want to lose the teeney bopper crowd with an ""R' rating. There was an interview I read that Rick stated the movie he made was not the movie released because of all the editing and he was very disappointed with the final cut...and from watching it you can tell there was horrible editing everywhere in the movie. Interesting that Rick used an editing room in the video for Love Somebody...maybe a shot at Universal Pictures ha ha.

Anyway...yes the script I read had alot more depth to it and again a much stronger film than what was released. So here is my question. Hard to Hold was originally given an ""R"" rating and I have been told that it it was a ""hard R"" no pun intended. Apparently there was alot of explicit sex scenes that were edited and alot of the language was cut. From reading the script I believe it. So my quest is to find the rated ""R' version...if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks",1306886400,,1294,4.3429752066115705
217981,5,6300183432,"By the early eighties Rick Springfield was the #1 rock star in North America. His albums went platinum, he won a Grammy for his self-penned ""Jessie's Girl"", he had a series of Top 10 singles, his concerts were sell-outs, and he made daytime television audiences swoom with his performance as Dr. Noah Drake on ""General Hospital"". So after he quit the daytime soap it was only natural for him to embark on a career on the big screen. The result was ""Hard To Hold"".

 It's very rare for a soap performer to become a movie star immediately. Usually, they have to act on primetime TV for awhile,  make a demand for themselves, then start with small roles in features. However, due to Rick Springfield's enormous musical success by 1984 it was believed he would make a name for himself on the big screen. This was not to be.

 I remember seeing ""Hard To Hold"" in theatres. Rick, of course, was gorgeous to look at, with that black hair and puppy dog face. Plus I knew he could act from his two years on daytime. However, even as a teenager I knew ""Hard To Hold"" was going to be a flop. The script was simply awful. Rick plays a rock star (not a big stretch for him) who embarks on a relationship with a so-called attractive woman who is a child psychiatrist. The fact that there was no chemistry between Rick and the woman who played his love interest made watching the film that more unbearable.

 After picking up Rick Springfield's new autobiography ""Late, Late at Night"" I thought it would be fun to watch ""Hard To Hold"" again. My feeling about the film, 26 years later, is the same. The movie falls flat, it is uninvolved, uninteresting, and simply a bad film. Buy the movie if your a fan of Rick Springfield's, like I am, as ""Hard To Hold"" is the only feature he has ever appeared in.

 What's great about the movie is the soundtrack. Very eighties, I was surprised how well the songs have held up all these years later. The title song from the movie ""Love Somebody"", a top 5 single for Rick, still makes me excited as it has a great chorus and wonderful beat.

 For all you women and gay guys out there there are two cute scenes with Rick showing off his butt. One with him running from some crazed fans where a woman pulls his towel off after he comes out of his dressing room . The other shows Rick in all his glory, faced down on a bed, naked as the camera pans over his impressive body. These scenes are worth the film!",1287014400,2,2425,4.3547671840354765
217982,2,6300183432,"I LOVE Rick and that will never change but the difference between how i ""thot"" i felt about this movie i remember from my teen years and now are well.......kinda ""hard to hold"" in LOL......stick to the singing babe!",1268784000,,215,4.538461538461538
217983,1,6300183432,"Here's how it happened for me. In the recent years I started getting into Rick Springfield. I reached a point where the only album I didn't have was ""Hard to Hold"", which was pretty ""hard to find"" in record stores. When I finally discovered online shopping, I looked for the CD, and found the cost a bit high. In the process of browsing through this website, I also discovered that my only missing Springfield album had a movie to complement it. Before then, I had no idea there even was a movie! Seeing as how [at the time] the movie was much more reasonably priced then the album, I thought of buying it. However, when I looked at the mostly unfavorable reviews for it, I thought better; and when I actually read the plot summary of the movie, it sounded kind of corny, so I held off buying it, instead taking the suggestion some of the reviews gave--to purchase the album rather than the movie.

After a while, I was able to scrounge up some credit and eventually purchase the LP, despite its being overpriced. I listened to the LP many months and was impressed with it, despite perhaps that it WAS a bit shorter than it should have been and I felt as if it could have used more songs. Just the same, after listening to the LP for a while, It became hard for me to imagine that the movie could be all that bad. I thought that maybe the people giving it negative reviews were just being arrogant or something. Once again I looked through the product, but was still hesitant in buying it. I decided to rent it instead. Boy, am I glad I did! This just has to be one of THE most horrible movies I ever watched! It's so childish so adolescent--as if made by a bunch of third-graders suffering from some kind of aging sickness or something.

In a nutshell, this is the story: we have an opening scene showing Springfield performing one of the songs from ""Hard to Hold"" in a concert scene. Afterward, he is pursued in his dressing room by someone he's trying to avoid. In the process of avoiding her, ends up leaving his dressing room in a bath towel, eventually taking someone else's pants which don't fit him. He then leaves the concert hall in a fancy car wearing oversized pants that he must hold up with one hand, and gets into an accident with a woman, who he instantly develops a crush on, and wearing almost no clothing. (Gee, what a way to make a first impression!) Eventually, he obsesses over her and starts sending her flowers and gifts. At first, she plays hesitant, but eventually ends up swallowing it! Within twenty minutes of the movie, he already has her in the sack. The movie pretty much is about nothing more than Rick Springfield's weird obsession with a woman who he has a car accident with! I just wonder who on earth thought of this story.

With cheesy lines like ""your very beautiful"" repeated over and over again. A really dumb and contrived serenading scene, and an even sillier scene featuring Janet Eiber or Elder (i'm not sure which) doing some silly dance number, how this movie even saw the light of day I can't imagine. My favorite line of all was ""stop harassing me!"" Harassing her? Yeah right! More like stalking her! If this where real life, he'd have likely been arrested before he ever got to first base. This movie, rather than focusing on any realities at all about the struggles and trials of being a rock star, is nothing more than a silly juvenile cat and mouse story about Rick Springfield chasing after some chick he gets into an accident with half-naked. Lacking in this movie was any of the true depth and meaning we found in such songs as ""Me and Johnny"", ""Celebrate Youth"", ""Jessie's Girl"", and even ""Taxi Dancing"", which is actually featured in this movie. Any of the songs that ARE featured in this movie, do not fit into it at all. ""Taxi Dancing"", a really passionate and compelling song is played over a scene where Rick Springfield is playing pool and has nothing to do with the scene at all. The whole film is like that, really. I can't even believe someone who could write so many intelligent songs like the ones I mentioned (and others), would have been silly enough to take a role like this.

I'm merely writing this review to blow off some steam. I'm glad I never bought this movie. Now, it even seems as if it's impossible to buy anyway! (Considering it's about $100.00 now, though who knows why?) We all should be quite thankful. Don't spoil the image that the LP album creates by watching this 90 minute load of tripe! Instead, get the LP, listen to it many times on your ipod and create your OWN movie in your mind!",1267228800,,4575,4.462365591397849

The concert scenes are TERRIFIC and having seen Rick in concert many times I enjoyed them very much.  Unfortunately, after the requisite ""beefcake shot"" of Rick, the plot of the movie slides downhill into Bad Soap Opera Land.

Rick CAN act and I have seen him give some amazing performances.  That said, this movie doesn't show his skills in the best light.  Mostly because the writing is HORRID but also because his co-star (Janet Eiber) is not much of an actress.  Rick does his best, but he's left hanging by a bad script and a lame director.

Now, if you're looking for some great Rick Springfield tunes, then this movie won't disappoint you in that respect.  The soundtrack should have won a Grammy.  There are fantastic songs from Rick (one of my personal favorites ""Stand Up"" is fun and energetic and the hit ""Love Somebody"" is terrific concert footage), and other very good artists contribute including Peter Gabriel.

218047,3,6300183432,"The main value this movie has for me is the nostalgia. It sort of got lost in the shuffle, seeing as Prince came out with a similar rock-star-struggling-to-find-himself think a few months later, and he did it much better (remember a littel film called Purple Rain?). I remember staying up all night long calling into the local radio station to win tickets to the premier showing in our town. It was a fun event, and Rick and his music generally are just a huge part of my teen years. Yes, the script is very weak (Diane:""You know, I really, really, really, really...care about you."" to drive the point home that she couldn't bring herself to say ""I love you."" C'mon, two reallys would have done it)and the director should have had his guild card revoked and had cut up pieces of celuloid shoved up his fingernails. I mean, yes Rick has a very cute tushy and I got a kick out of seeing it as much as the next person, but around the third time, I was like ""c'mon, he's more than a cute butt!""

BUT... that having been said, this character was a nice departure from Dr. Noah Drake, his General Hospital alter ego. He CAN act, but this film just didn't give him much to work with unfortunately. If you want to see Rick flex his thesbian muscles, check out Silent Motive. He co-stars as a not-so-recovered cocaine addict, and is so convincing it's scary. But on the plus side for Hard To Hold, Rick looks really good throughout this movie, and the sound track is one of my favorite Rick Springfield records. I know it's not his favorite (he says it was written and recorded under the influence of a big case of Page 37 syndrome. You know, ""this is what happens on page 37 of the script. Write a song to fit it"") but it's still some really great work. The concert scenes are fun, too.

It should be obvious that this film will hold the most appeal for fans of Rick Springfield. He is a much better actor than one might assume and plays some of the awkwardly-written swings of his character well. Janet Eilber does a good job as the conservative ""ordinary"" woman his character falls in love with. The weakest performance in the film is Patti Hansen's, as the rocker's songwriting partner and former girlfriend. She works hard but can't overcome the stilted dialogue she's given in most of her scenes.
The best part of the movie may be the music. The majority of the songs in the film are written and performed by Springfield and will be familiar to fans.
