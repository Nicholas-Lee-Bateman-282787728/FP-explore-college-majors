5835406,5,B00DNF1SKK,"I picked this out of a row of ""Suggestions for You"" because I love a good global-catastrophe movie -- and I have to say, I'm delighted to spend the time watching it, because it's so utterly, utterly terrible.  Looking for something to MST3K?  Something to create a drinking game for?  This is your movie!

It opens with a young couple making out in the back seat of a car in Georgetown.  When a black SUV rolls up, blue lights flashing, and a couple of guys in dark suits drag the girl out of the car, identifying her as the President's daughter, her paramour blurts in bewilderment, ""I've been dating the President's daughter??!?""  Aaaaannnnd we rocket delightfully downhill from there.  The characters are all ridiculously two-dimensional, the sets are '60s-era cheesy, and the acting is something any high school drama student would be proud of.

And the science?  AWESOME.

If you're looking for a movie that makes a lick of sense, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for something that'll make you howl with laughter, go ahead and rent this one.

Anxiously awaiting the sequel...",1390003200,13,1086,4.8108108108108105

5835408,2,B00DNF1SKK,"NASA launches a ""scaler drive"" into the sun which causes it to go ""hyper active."" The Earth has two days left unless rivals can come together and hand deliver another scaler drive to the sun. The film contains various subplots including the Chief of Staff trying to get the President to resign. The special effects were noticeably CG. The science left much to be desired as apparently we have created cooling systems that allow us to fly near the sun without breaking out a sweat. The science was so bad, I was surprised NASA didn't decide to launch their sun probe at night to avoid the sunlight altogether.

The film is SyFy quality and Canadian lame.

5835456,4,B00DNF1SKK,"The first privately-owned space shuttle with 2 crew, 2 civilians, the President's wife, and the shuttle's owner takes off with the goal of flying around the moon.  Dr. Craig Backus (Anthony Lemke) is the Chief Scientist and former NASA engineer who designed the aircraft.  Solar flares cause a catastrophic failure involving the Scaler Drive that Backus invented.  NASA has sent former astronaut/hero Cmdr Don Wincroft (David James Elliott) to observe.  Don, Craig, and Cheryl (Natalie Brown), the President's current science advisor, were best friends back at NASA.  Craig and Cheryl married, then divorced.  When Don and Cheryl married, Craig broke off his friendship with Don.  Lots of tension between Don and Craig throughout the movie.  The stories of the two civilians are revealed, as well as the President's reaction to events.
I bought this dvd because I am a huge DJE fan, but IMHO, it's Anthony Lemke who steals the show.  Definitely worth the price of the dvd.  I might have rated it 5-star except that disaster movies really aren't my thing.",1443916800,4,1054,5.075581395348837

5835487,5,B00DNF1SKK,"This movie had me at the edge of my seat.  Disasters on earth because of our sun's natural EM emissions have been a real threat from the time electrical power was harnessed here and we became fully dependent upon it.  While this movie is science fiction, it's not a stretch to imagine what could happen should humanity be allowed to tinker with inventions like the one depicted in the film.  That such inventions are not likely to be seen for centuries is comforting, but our sun could wreak havoc on us nonetheless, quite naturally.  This film might exaggerate using fictional devices, yet we should all understand what can and will happen in the event of massive EMPs from our sun.

I thought the movie was well done and the acting convincing.  Kudos to Canada and Canadians.  Good stuff is coming from that country - keep it coming.",1423008000,,835,4.639455782312925

5835504,1,B00DNF1SKK,"Unbelievably bad.

SOME PLOT SPOILERS:

This is a science fiction film, without one bit of science.  There are no ""Laws of Physics"" in this film.  It will remind you of a 1950's film where the actors take a trip to the moon or to Mars, without space suits, and earth gravity is forever present in the space ship.

The plot is totally absurd: Present day civilian space flight around the moon and back in a space ship that can reach orbit without an Atlas rocket or any type of external booster.  Yeah, it looks something like the space shuttle and takes off like a regular airplane, and once it reaches orbit it kicks in it's ""special"" engines than can reach a speed of over 5,000 miles per minute.  Star Trek stuff in present day time frame.  And no one questions it.  Huh?

Also, there are 3 subplots that make no sense, and do not contribute one iota to the trip to the moon -- and subsequent accidental trip to the sun, which creates the global catastrophe (Exploding Sun) because of the planes special engines!?

The major subplot is how do they -- the two guys (one a scientist and one a pilot) that hate each others guts -- solve the problem of the sun exploding and sending enough radiation to the earth to sterilize all life?  Surprise!  The military secretly made a second space ship (how convenient) so let's send this ship with it's special engines to the sun to stop the sun from exploding.  And where as the first space ship engines had ""Direct Current"", the second ship has ""Alternate Current"" which will reverse the catastrophe caused by the first ship, and the sun will calm down and the earth will be saved.  Think it will work???  Why not go to Disneyland and wish upon a star?  That holiday trip has the same basis in physics -- and odds of affecting the sun -- but will be more fun.

Also, another non-scientific nonsense plot line of this film is: All of the major characters are continually pissed off at each other.  And why?  Now get this: The scientist's super hot wife left him for the pilot because he was not showing her enough attention! AND all three of them were best friends and constant companions before she started sleeping with the pilot.  Evidently, the pilot never had a girlfriend except his best friend's wife.  This constant on screen angst only serves to aggravate the audience.

I did you a favor.  I watched the entire movie for you.  Scarlett Johansson appearing in a nude love scene with Jennifer Lawrence (like the film ""Blue is the Warmest Color"") would not have saved this film.

Trust me, do something better with you life.  Toss a ball with your kid, or tell your spouse you love them.",1410048000,13,2637,4.508438818565401
5835505,3,B00DNF1SKK,"This film is essentially a remake of THE CORE with the space shuttle discovering the ""planet-threatening disaster"" stretched from 10 minutes to TWO HOURS.  (Maybe the creators thought that people would enjoy TWO DISASTER MOVIES in the same package -- PART 1 being the space shuttle disaster and PART II being Bruce Willis's ARMAGEDDON).  The production values and acting are very good, however.  The only good part of PART II is that it shows that today in 2014 the ONLY method of interplanetary travel that man has yet developed is still Freeman Dyson's PROJECT ORION from 1957 (throwing a-bombs out of the back of the spaceship for propulsion)..  So much for the future as depicted in ""The Jetsons""..",1409011200,,702,4.923728813559322

It reminds me of the longer disaster movies such as ""Category 7: Day of Destruction,"" where it runs a long time and works in lots of subplots and characters with back stories. Especially intrigued by Julia Ormond's character of a refugee camp worker in the Middle East, who provides a non-USA slant and an ""I wasn't expecting that"" moment. First half of movie is a space drama with astronauts and thrusters. Second half is the apocalyptic disaster, hoping someone will step in and save the world. Loses one star because solar crisis doesn't provide great scenes of crumbling landmarks or collapsing buildings - it just kind of rains deadly sunshine that burns people.
