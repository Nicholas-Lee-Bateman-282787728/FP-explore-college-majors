8374793,5,B002N5L4SC,"This dvd contains 4 movies for a very good price. The Benji is the classic and the best on the dvd. The Miracle Dogs is a cute movie too. For the Love of Benji is not bad but not so good than the classic Benji. The Quigley... the dog is cute, but the story for a kid (smallest) is not too interesting.",1341792000,,301,3.870967741935484
8374794,5,B002N5L4SC,My son broke his Benji disc so we got this as a replacement.  It has not only the original Benji but also For the Love of Benji and two other films---a real bargain.,1316476800,,165,4.0
