I happen to own this movie, because Broadway's fabulous Donna Murphy is one of the stars.  After meeting her in New York City, I decided to watch some of her lesser known films since she was SO amazing and lovely.  Her church scene in the film, by the way, is amazing though!  Donna Murphy fans-you'll truly enjoy!  Hysterical.

Well-this film was ridiculous-mostly the ending is what is ridiculous-in acting and in making sense.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!

The film follows multiple characters throughout a day, October 22, and we find many interesting people-including a strange but at first seemingly sweet and harmless man, played by Ernie Hudson, and another guy who is desperate after losing a job, and buying a gun.  Also we follow Donna as a woman showing up at her ex-husband's wedding-in a low cut and tight number, very drunk; a man working double shifts and buying a birthday gift for his son; and Amanda Plummer, the next door neighbor whom Ernie is in love with and we later find out-is STALKING.  She finds this out, gets creeped out and basically tells him to leave her alone.  FLASHFORWARD-to the end of the movie where everyone is in a restaurant having dinner and the desperate gunman outside, about to shoot himself.  Ernie Hudson barges in with Rambo-like machine guns and starts shooting people left and right, because the object of his obsessed affection, Amanda Plummer,is a waitress there and he intends to kill her now that she doesn't want him.  [So of course, the one black man in the film is the crazy shooter (come on people!)] and the suicidal gunman comes in and ends up saving the day by shooting and killing Ernie.  Basically everyone dies, except Amanda and the suicidal man from before.  The end-honestly comes from left field and doesn't really make a lot of sense!  The movie ends in this pointless blood battle, but not before the HILARIOUS busting in of the police who find the suicidal character, in total shock, pointing the already shot gun at Ernie, who is dead on the floor.  They ATTACK him and start beating him up until one of the cops finally see Ernie, with rambo artillery strapped to him.  The cop shouts to the others that they got the wrong guy and without dropping a beat they stop beating him with their cop clubs and say ""Oh, sorry man."" and walk away!  Brilliant!

So if you like bad movies with some good and some not so good actors mixed up together with awful dialogue-you'll love this atrocious film!  I know I do!",1155254400,3,2583,4.670353982300885
7897438,4,6305869227,"Tired of the same 'ol bang 'em up movie or typical love story?  This is a grossly underrated film.  It depicts several people's lives during a one day period: simple folk, such as you and I.  Generic camera shots,nothing spectacular, usually from angles that you'd see on a average day.
Don't get me wrong;  it's not Emmy-bound, but it's worth not only seeing-it's a good investment to your collection.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.",979948800,7,439,4.786666666666667
