6817958,4,B00PLYU7LW,"Olivia Williams is, to me, quietly becoming a major player in the world of horror cinema. She's been in some great British horror in recent years, and brings with her some serious acting skills. Altar is a great example of the type of films she's really nailing: slow paced, largely psychological, beautiful settings, and great storylines.

Altar tells the story of an interior designer/remodeler of high end British estates, etc., and her husband. Together, they have to contend with a haunted castle that impacts them both in different ways, but ultimately drives them each to the brink of sanity: what's real, and what is not. This really is one of those films that you need to settle in and absorb all the way through in order to get the full effect of the slow build and the mental devolving of each of the main characters. Some horror flicks, obviously, you can kinda watch while doing other things, like folding laundry or working through your To Do list.

In sum, though, I have to say, not a lot of payoff in Altar as far as scares or chills. It's a decent movie. Well made and directed, but I'd ultimately say it's just an ""OK"" horror movie. Worth a rental if you're into the aspects I described, but definitely not if you're more into more visceral supernatural movies with a lot of jump scares, etc...

Anyway, I hope this review helps a bit in deciding. The trailer, too, actually captures the film pretty well - unlike some other movies.",1425772800,13,1451,4.638132295719845

6817961,5,B00PLYU7LW,"Another underappreciated Gem. Nick willing is a genius. His films have wonderful messages and pacing that only a skilled and seasoned director can bring to the screen. From the fantastic 'Photographing Fairies' to 'Close your Eyes' aka 'Doctor Sleep' to 'The River King', not to forget the miniseries collections he has done which include 'Tin Man' and 'Alice'.

6817963,5,B00PLYU7LW,"Spectacular The Haunting Of Radcliffe House renamed Altar is perfection with top notch special effects apparitions spooky happenings eeriness and Gothic elements. I love the subtle way throughout the movie it leads up to various things. Who says a movie cannot be scary without blood and guts? This one proves it can. A husband and wife with their 2 children she a restorer of old historical houses, and he an artist move into a rather eerie house that unknown to them has a mystery and dark secret of it's own, The man who many years ago lived their with his with his wife was also an artist

The happy family is carrying on with their usual lives then strange and scary things start happening frightening the daughter at first the mother chalks it up to her daughter having nightmares even though the beautiful woman ghost was really in her bedroom. As the story progresses things become more intense the father of the girls slowly begins to change in the strangest of ways. Spooky things and ghosts begin manifesting . A strange man stops by one day and afterward the mother makes a startling discovery about him",1424649600,7,1115,4.688775510204081

6817965,5,B00PLYU7LW,"A great film. I really loved it. Superb performances from the entire cast especially Olivia Williams whom I have followed the career of for many years and have seen nearly everything she has done. I consider myself a purist when it comes to films that are classified as horror. I have seen 1000`s of films in my lifetime and can honestly say that ""Altar"" works on so many levels for me. It isn`t blood and gore filled which just bores me, it has a decidedly creepy feel as the film progresses. The house and that room are also the stars of the film.
I highly recommend the film to all of you who long for an old fashioned scare as this film delivers. Special shout out to Antonia Clarke and Adam Thomas Wright as the children and to Richard Dillane and Matthew Modine who both give edgy performances.",1424304000,18,800,4.412162162162162
6817966,4,B00PLYU7LW,"All the best  for Altar! It's a really good film, very atmospheric with a top cast, and Matthew Modine is truly SCARY!",1424304000,3,118,4.363636363636363
6817967,4,B00PLYU7LW,"""Altar"" and ""The Haunting of Radcliffe House"" are the same film. The Hamilton family moves into the old Radcliffe house in order to restore it. The townies are leery of the place and are not much help. Meg (Olivia Williams) and her husband Alec (Matthew Modine) perform the bulk of the work. They have an asthmatic daughter Penny (Antonia Clarke) and a son (Adam Thomas Wright) who is underdeveloped plot wise.

While they are restoring they discover the proverbial secret room and this one has floor art, which is apparently an altar whose function is unknown. At this point strange things seem to happen as Alec punctured his finger and his blood fell to the floor in that room, ""Hell Raiser"" memory flash as it gets sucked up. The events build up slow as we discover what happens in that house.

This is a run of the mill ghost story. Nothing really new, but it was done well.

Guide: F-bomb, implied forced sex. Olivia Williams brief nudity (?) Statue nude being fondled.  3 1/2 stars",1420848000,19,988,4.628571428571429

6818000,4,B00PLYU7LW,"Altar is a good British film, insofar as it isn't afraid to take the slow-burn approach to horror. Things come on slowly, in small gradients, and I liked that.  Olivia Williamss portrayal of Meg Hamilton is fabulous. The acting all around is good, pacing is good, effects are good, so is the mood and atmosphere, but as a genre piece it contributes nothing new, breaks no new ground. Still, it is worth checking out, especially for fans of the British school of horror.",1487980800,,469,4.650602409638554
6818001,2,B00PLYU7LW,"I didn't necessarily dislike Altar, but it's a story we've watched a hundred times before.

6818002,3,B00PLYU7LW,"If you're young and haven't read a lot of horror stories or seen a lot of horror movies, this might be for you.  For we more jaded folk, there are a few genuinely disturbing moments, but all in all it turns out to be a very run of the mill ghost story.  Throwing in references to the Rosicrucians was basically unnecessary, since I doubt that many of the viewers know who they are.",1467417600,,381,4.205479452054795

6818005,3,B00PLYU7LW,"Starting with a good premise, it fairly quickly falls into a series of haunted amusement house like moments and standard atmospheric tripe.  It deviated from a story to a fun-house effect with no real sense of why events were unfolding and who the players were outside of the family-protagonists.  While at least it didn't rely on mutilation and snuff-sex, it seems to have aimed for a feeling one gets from The Others and misses by a mile.  That said, it'll scare your kids and provide backdrop for your Halloween party.  But see it on Netflix and avoid purchasing this one for you collection, unless poorly directed after school specials are your bag.",1444176000,3,653,4.803571428571429

6818022,4,B00PLYU7LW,"""Altar' was released in the UK as ""The Haunting of Radcliffe House"". It features Olivia Williams as Meg Hamilton, an expert in restoration work who moves her family, comprising her artist husband Alec (played by Matthew Modine), and their two children, Penny and Harper from their home in London to an old, abandoned mansion called the Radcliffe House out on the Yorkshire Moors. The house has a reputation because of its grisly history and the local townspeople are not keen to help Meg work on restoring the mansion. Having no choice but to carry out the work on it by herself, Meg discovers strange things in the house, including a tiled floor in the root cellar that depicts an image attributed to the Rosicrucians. Teenager Penny gets eerie visitations by a female spirit who is all scarred, but none of the adults will believe her, attributing it to nightmares.

Over a period of time, even Meg begins to see and experience strange things although the skeptic in her tries to rationalize away her experiences. Then husband Alec begins to really go off the rails, working in secret at all hours on a new project that he refuses to let anyone else see. What exactly is happening to the Hamilton's?

I thought this was a pretty decent, highly atmospheric haunted house ghost story. The chills are there although they could have been better done. The story itself is nothing new except for the references to Rosicrucianism. There are parts of the story that reminded me of ""The Skeleton Key"". The cinematography of the serene yet eerie Yorkshire countryside is beautifully done and the house itself is a central character in the story and I enjoyed watching the story unfold in various key rooms in the house. The suspense factor is well built and the pacing for the most part is good. Final verdict: a bit derivative but the performances of the cast and the suspense do make for an engaging viewing experience.",1429315200,,1913,4.77643504531722
6818023,4,B00PLYU7LW,"This is a good basic ghosts in a creepy house kind of tale.  Decent acting.  Decent filming.  Nothing extraordinary, but a perfectly good tale.  Not a lot of scares, but enough creepiness to be entertaining.",1428796800,,207,4.828571428571428

I enjoy movies like this one a lot!
At first it appears as a haunted house movie but because of the other dimension to it makes it more interesting and enjoyable.
The issue I had with it is that I felt the story was incomplete. I understood what happened in the ending, but I did not really understand how, as the movie did not adequately explain the concept of the ritual. So, that was the big downside here.
I would definitely recommend.",1425859200,2,521,4.4375

If the ending would have been better made I would have given it a three or four simply because from the beginning the whole ""I guess my husband always goes crazy and pours blood on me and rapes me in strange rooms it's just a fact of life for artists and renovators"".
