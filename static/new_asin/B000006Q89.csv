7904713,5,B000006Q89,"Brian was the FDNY Captain and His brother Ray was the producer of this film.
I grew up with them both in Bethpage NY. Unfortunately Ray passed from Cancer shortly after the films release and Brian passed at the WTC on 9/11.

These were two incredible upstanding guys. They also both had a great sense of humor too. Ray was a little sillier than Brian, especially as a kid growing up.

May they rest in peace and togetherness as they look over their families and all those that knew them. In the 60's and 70's while I lived there, Bethpage was a very close knit town where everyone knew everybody and you left your doors unlocked and your neighbors walked right in calling your name. In particular and more so in ""the numbered streets"". They were and always will be examples of what Bethpage produced and they are and will forever be hometown heroes.",1315526400,,850,4.512987012987013
