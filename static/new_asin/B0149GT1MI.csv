7385571,4,B0149GT1MI,"There WAS room for improvement; even the best movies are not perfect. This movie was MORE ""18 Again"" or ""Freaky Friday""
than ""Christmas Carol"", but the actors carried it off. Trying to be as respectful as I can---hell, I'm 67, myself---the familiar faces
in this movie all aged... except for, the eternally-young, Tom Arnold. Maybe it was the divorce from Roseanne?

Seriously though, this was quite entertaining. The three leads did an excellent job! I'd recommend this for a few good laughs!",1447200000,,493,5.012195121951219

7385574,5,B0149GT1MI,Really enjoyed this movie. Billy Baldwin was hilarious and it's always great to see Tom Arnold in a Christmas movie. Kids loved it too. Hadn't heard of it before so I didn't know what to expect. Very pleasantly surprised. Great family holiday viewing.,1446595200,8,251,4.8604651162790695
7385575,1,B0149GT1MI,"This movie was the dumbest movie I have seen a long time.  Save your money and don't purchase it.  I have enjoyed William Baldwin's two previous Hallmark movies, but this one was hard to watch.  I suppose if you were an 11 year old, you might like it.  Thumbs down!!",1446595200,2,266,4.26

7385578,5,B0149GT1MI,"It was very well done, good family movie for Family video night, good storyline, certainly different than other similar movies out there. What made this DVD cool is that i personally know Michael Campion so it made it that much cooler to watch and to have. Unless you haven't heard, Michael has been cast as JD Fuller, DJ's oldest son for the Full House re-boot Fuller house, the series comes out next month, keep an eye out.",1452124800,3,425,4.532467532467533

7385583,3,B0149GT1MI,"Corporate attorney Mitch Taylor (William Baldwin) has lost his wife and has Denise Richards and Jennifer Grant throwing themselves at him. His ignored son Robbie (Michael Campion) isn't taking it as well and has been pestered by a bully at school. Mitch has pressures at work, among which is a bossy boss (Anne Stedman). Pardon my use of the word ""bossy"" which is objectionable by feminists...but when you see her you will realize I am using the polite word as her character is unrealistically over-the-top...don't blame me.

A stuffed bear left on the doorstep creates a Christmas wish that creates a ""Freaky Friday"" for Mitch and Robbie with the expected formula results. The film is for kids. It is not as good as the other role reversal films. As a new me-too Christmas film for kids, it fits the bill. Don't expect a lot.",1448755200,,826,4.736111111111111

8730119,1,B0149GT1MI,"BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS & SPECIALS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.

In this film Mitch Taylor is a workaholic attorney and widowed dad to a 12-year-old son, Robbie. Lately, Mitch is in way over his head, as he tries to be a dad, please his hard-edged boss and become partner at his firm, while dealing with an impatient girlfriend. His son Robbie has problems of his own. The school bully has made Robbie his latest target, he tries not to be a total nerd in front of the girl he likes, and to make things worse, he was unwillingly cast as lead role in the Christmas pageant. Robbie really want his dad to go out of his way this year to make Christmas all it's cracked up to be. Mitch and Robbie definitely think the other has it pretty easy- until a mysterious toy causes them to switch bodies. They are forced to find out what it's like to spend the holidays in each other's shoes.

There was zero to like this film. The plot is a rip-off of ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Freaky Friday"" was remade TWICE and they were both much better than this crap.

Billy Baldwin does not have enough charm or innocence to pull this off! Those were 2 things you need to have in order to make this film seem somewhat plausible! He comes across in this like ""Someone who is mentally Challenged"". His co-star Michael Campion only comes across slightly better!

Don't waist your time on this. Its a huge bore!",1505347200,,1632,4.358552631578948
