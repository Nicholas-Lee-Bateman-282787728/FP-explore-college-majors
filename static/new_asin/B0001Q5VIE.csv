Other than that, it's a typical Bollywood pot-boiler for its era; the story is preposterous and a lot of the acting is over the top, but it's good for some chuckles.
As for the DVD itself, the English subtitles simply stop appearing at at least two points during the film, each incidence lasting through several dialogues. One can figure out in the end what has been going on in the story, but the gaps are annoying.
Picture and sound quality are no better than you might expect from such an old film  Shemaroo is not Criterion, as we know.",1511481600,,725,4.41044776119403
