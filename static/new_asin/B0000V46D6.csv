1948321,5,B0000V46D6,"Another great season of Queer As Folk.  Every character gets a chance to shine.  Story lines include Brian working on the mayoral campaign of a homophobic candidate, Ted's dissent into drug addiction, Michael and Justin working on the gay comic Rage, Melanie and Lindsay deciding to have another child and Debbie getting involved with a police detective.  This season contains 14 episodes.  On quibble is the packaging, the discs sit on top of each other and sort of slide into place, if you want to watch the disc on the bottom you have to remove the other two.  It's also hard to get them to slide into place.",1435363200,,611,4.62037037037037

1948346,5,B0000V46D6,"you guys at Amazon slipped a gear here, my name is Chad Allen, not Gene Gange.  AND THE REVIEW WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SEASON TWO, NOT SEASON THREE AS IS SHOWN.  PLEASE CORRECT THIS NICE PEOPLE AT AMAZON.COM! (then please edit out this portion only, leave my actual review in place, thank you)

again, no let-downs.  it took quite some time between last evening and today to finish about the last half of season two of Queer as Folk.  i again enjoyed it very much.  the third season is yet to be started by me, but it will be soon, and i can't wait to see what it holds for my entertainment.

again, getting the first, second and third seasons of Queer as Folks is a good value as far as i'm concerned.  anyone interested in the series should try it out, i don't think you will be disappointed!  Amazon. Com delivered exactly what i ordered.  no complaints.

sincerely,
Chad Allen",1376092800,,879,4.364197530864198
1948347,5,B0000V46D6,"I was fortunate enough to see the UK version of this award winning show being filmed in Manchester and I have a lot of respect for both the UK & USA version of QAF

For both , its ground-breaking TV , the subject is at times very taboo and both Channel 4 in the UK and Showtime in the USA took the brave and bold steps to make Russell T Davies ( yes, he of the Doctor Who / Torchwood  era ) project a reality.

Whilst the UK version was tight on budget  it was also tight on story & plot lines and you felt at times you wanted to know more about the characters and their background ( A spin off show in the UK called  Misfits  covering the characters complex back stories was in the works but never got to camera ) . The USA version however does what the UK version couldn't achieve
The budget on this production is vast, and can been seen in all its glory on the DVDs . The UKs  Series 1 entire plotline is swallowed up by EP 7 of Season 1 of this production  but then Showtime give us the added pleasure of expanding the storyline Much.. .much NO.way much further then its gritty British counterpart

Its a must TV and youll be needed to seek all  5 seasons of this completing drama to get the full story. I won't spoil any of the plotlines but yes there are a lot of a wow, I didn't see that coming moments 

BOTH the UK & USA versions are fantastic but this version is given a bigger reign that just takes it that one step further to the drinks bar at Babylon!",1375920000,,1464,4.027681660899654
1948348,5,B0000V46D6,"I would recommend this series to anybody, gay or straight.  The episodes are all compelling and the characters are all endearing.",1366329600,,129,5.142857142857143

1948351,5,B0000V46D6,I now have the complete series. All four sets are perfect. What more can I say. I wish the series was ongoing.,1363478400,,110,4.045454545454546
1948352,5,B0000V46D6,"I am still heartbroken that they canceled this series after only five seasons, but it was a fantastic show none the less.",1355184000,,121,4.545454545454546
1948353,5,B0000V46D6,"I came across this series by fluke and I'm so grateful it happened. I went through the entire series in less than a week. (Yes, I have no life.)By far this is the best television series I had watched yet! It was definitely groundbreaking and one of a kind. It ended too soon in my opinion. I couldn't wait to own the DVDs so within a week of finishing the series I had to order the DVDs and now I am re-watching it and telling my friends about it.

Regardless of the sexual orientation of the characters, this series tells one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I've never cried or laughed so hard. Although the series only lasted five seasons (and seasons 3-5 were only 13-14 episodes long) this series has won a very special place in my heart. I highly, HIGHLY recommend it! If you're uncertain, watch it anyway, it may surprise you...",1338508800,,877,4.41358024691358
1948354,3,B0000V46D6,In the third season the best show  begins to show its age.  It starts with Justin leaving  Brian.  And  Ted and  Emmitt trying to have a relationship.  Are we to believe Brian is broken hearted over Justin?  Is  Ethan the perfect match for Justin?What started out as a great  study of life for young gays in smalltown America has fizzled to a soap opera for its straight female fans.  The two scenes hit bottom for me are Lindsay and Melanie asking Brian to be the father of their second child.  Why  would any man agree after the hell they put Brian through with Gus?  And even more unbelievable is the reunion of Brian and Justin.  How many times must we endure the breakup and reunion of Brian and Justin? I'm sure the straight female fans gushing over the nudity are thrilled.  But for the rest of us it is very old news.  The show works better when it strays from the soap opera like watching Brian taking down Stockwell.  For me those are the best moments of the series.  Just skip over the soap opera.,1320710400,,1008,4.351351351351352
1948355,5,B0000V46D6,"I love the American version much better, the characters are real, hot and belieable. I liked this book very much. I enjoyed this book very much because it was just what I was looking for. I try to spread out my reading to keep a wide variety following. This book kept my interest. I liked the balance, the development of the characters and the over all pictures created. I share my reviews with two book clubs, one in New York and the other here in Aspen. I love to share reviews of book as it is so positive and I get great tips. This book will be an added showcase. I try my best to give either a positive review or nothing at all, negative review are worthless to me and those in our book clubs, we look for the positive.

1948359,5,B0000V46D6,"Season 3 is shorter that the previous 2 seasons, but no less riveting. Aside from Michael's delightful angst regarding fathering the girls' next baby, there's a pretty dark shadow that prevails. My favorite character, Ted, makes his most irresponsible decision; Michael has to deal with other drug problems affecting him; Brian shows more apathy than usual; Justin's new love goes awry; and lots of other stuff that I don't wanna give away. What keeps this amazing series alive is the unflinching and seamless consistancy of the actors/characters. Nothing is compromised, and it's Brian, of all people, who ends up smelling like a rose (at least to those close to him). I think in this 3rd series, Ted (Scott Lowell) carries the acting honors, though Justin (Randy Harrison) comes very close. I'll miss the involvement of the gorgeous Ethan (Fabrizio Felippo), but life goes on, as do the ""Folk"". I look forward to Season 4...",1246838400,,926,5.01948051948052
1948360,3,B0000V46D6,"I thought the first season of Queer as Folk was just fantastic, so I purchased the next two seasons.  Each successive season has gotten weaker and weaker.  The story lines are ever more sensational, bordering on ridiculous, and often times the most difficult tensions in the plot are not resolved by the characters, but they simply disappear from the plot.  For example, Michael and David are in a great crisis, the suspense in high as you can't imagine how they will get out of it...  cut to Justin and Bryan, then back to Michael and David and the crisis is solved.  How?  No idea, and apparently the writers didn't have any idea, either.  This said, the third season is mildly entertaining, but I have no intention to go on to the fourth or fifth.  I understand the downward trend just continues.",1238112000,,799,4.617021276595745
1948361,5,B0000V46D6,"Starting with season 3 Showtime dropped the amount of ""Queer as Folk"" shows to 14, down from 20 from the previous season. Apparently, this was due to the huge production costs the producers found themselves in. Still, season 3 is another great season. However, like many fans of the show I felt this was the year ""Queer as Folk' got into a lull in regards to story. I found the ""mayor story"", in which a man runs for office and tries to shut down Liberty Avenue, ran way too long, and we are relieved when it's over. On the other hand the show dramatized it's best storyline ever with the character of Ted and his downfall into drug addiction. The writers also dealt with the character of Hunter and explored teenage prostitution. The performances are always first rate and the shows are produced in widesceen format.
 There are great bonus features too that feature interviews with the cast and crew.",1237161600,,901,4.63125

This series touches on many subjects that we all deal with on a day to day basis, however it opens your eyes to the ignorance that a gay person has to deal with all because of who they love..I will never promote predjudice or ignorance in my home, and this series has truly given me a whole new look on life...I fell in love with all the characters, however my absolute favorite is Emmit. I recommend this series to everyone who is open minded. It is a feel good and a tear jerker all rolled up in one...My hat is off to the cast and the producer of this series..Only thing I wish, is that it didn't end..",1142985600,,1014,4.342105263157895

It joins a short list of GROUNDBREAKING tv shows (QAF, Nip/Tuck, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Weeds, Lost) that change how we view T.V.

Watching this series is like viewing an excellent movie. A really long one !!!

Or great T.V. with no commercials or breaks between episodes.

There are a lot of graphic scenes, but do not be fooled, this show is for EVERYONE as it deals with real life problems. This season deals with a lot of issues that concerns people in the gay community. Politics - the evil politician taking over Liberty Avenue. Crystal drug addiction that takes the best of dear old Teddy, and much much more. Not only are the episodes great, but we are given (though not the best) at least decent extras.

A deeper look into the psyche of characters revealing their darkest sides proves shocking and elevates the show to another level emotionally. Michael and Ben do a little community outreach while Justin and Brian contribute do their community through political avenues. Ted and Emmett deal with a new and fairly large elephant in the room that everyone else is able to see but them. Debbie learns and excercises her newly found oral skills and Uncle Vick finds a trick. Relationships morph, friendships are tested, jobs are lost and true feelings finally begin to surface.

The stakes are raised in this series, tackling politics, drug addiction and parenthood. All the characters go through a hard time, some more than others.

My two main issues are the length of the series, it is too short; more or less half a series. The other problem is although good, this is not as good as the two previous series. For me thes are the only things preventing it from getting a five star rating.",1122940800,,661,4.365853658536586
1948392,4,B0000V46D6,"Nominated for 9 Craft Awards (bestowed by the Director's Guild of Canada), Queer As Folk is a groundbreaking drama series that has built itself a large cult following since its inception in 2000. Based on a British TV series of the same name, Queer As Folk is in many ways similar to HBO's Sex And The City, and it's one of the first TV dramas to be completely centered around the lives of homosexual characters, or even have prominent homosexual characters - following on the heels of groundbreaking sitcoms such as Ellen (1994) and Will & Grace (1998). The brainchild of UK-born writer and creator Russell T. Davies, Queer As Folk follows the life and times of a group of gay friends as they live out their respective lives in modern-day America...

Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Queer As Folk follows the exploits of a group of gay and lesbian friends who live on or around Liberty Avenue. Most of the scenes take place either in the character's homes, a local diner, or the popular gay nightclub Babylon. Lindsay Peterson (Thea Gill) and Melanie Marcus (Michelle Clunie) comprise the lone lesbian couple to star in the series, while various gay friends and neighbors such as Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), Michael Novotny-Bruckner (Hal Sparks), Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison), Ted Schmidt (Scott Lowell), Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige), etc. deal with each other and their own varying relationships. Composed in a drama/soap opera format, Queer As Folk centers wholly on the careers and lives (including sex, drugs, love, friendships, tragedies, etc.) of its diverse characters, maintaining a specific focus on its attempted realistic portrayal and illustration of the American homosexual lifestyle...

The Queer As Folk (Season 3) DVD features a number of interesting episodes including the season premiere in which everyone is surprised to learn that Justin has broken up with Brian and is now in a relationship with Ethan. Brian sinks into depression, and Michael confronts Justin about the situation, telling him leave town and never come back. When Brian and Justin end up at Melanie and Lindsay's party, Brian attempts a reconciliation, but is rebuffed. After Michael badmouths Justin, Brian surprises everyone by punching him out... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Episode 305"" in which anti-gay Police Chief Stockwell is running for mayor and his campaign is the focus of everyone's activities on Liberty Avenue, and ""Episode 311"" in which everyone is frustrated by Stockwell's crackdown on Liberty Avenue while Emmett is concerned when a depressed Ted fails to come home one night...

1948394,4,B0000V46D6,"I do think QAF is a decent show, I like the characters and the plots. But I really don't think they get to the heart of contraversey. This show makes it seem like being a gay male in America is just as easy as being straight. They're only usually portrayed in the midst of the gay culture. I would like to see more honesty. Because in this patriarchal, homophobic racist culture being the ""other"" is not easy like this show would have it seem. They don't ever touch on the fact that in most states in America one could get fired for being homosexual. There are no laws that protect against it. Brian, who is a fairly affluent business man would always have to live a double life. He couldn't really be that openly gay in a business world, where hyper masculinity reigns. I would like to see how the characters deal with this prejudice in their everyday lives. They only touch it briefly in the first episode. Also all of the characters are white males ( and women). Homophobia is not something that is widely accepted in many communities of color. I think they could bring up excellent contraversey with that.",1100908800,,1109,4.4950495049504955
1948395,3,B0000V46D6,"I loved Seasons One and Two but Season Three was far from exciting. It had it's good moments. I loved the conflict between Brian and Stockwell and the Michael/Ben/Hunter dynamic. And I also enjoyed the focus on the drama instead of the sex but it wasn't as captivating.

I hated that they had broken-up Ethan and Justin. It didn't fit how they broke them up. Ethan had way too much passion and love for Justin just to go out and cheat on him. It was all to get the ""golden couple"" Brian and Justin back together. I am not big fan of that couple to begin with. So I didn't like that. I also wasn't a big fan of the Ted's addiction to meth storyline. It made no sense. In season one he was deeply against Blake's addiction, so why would he do it? I knew he was down and out but it made no sense.

Lastly, the length. The seasons are normally twenty shows long. Only fourteen? I feel cheated.

Not a great season but I will definately be waiting out Season Four.",1098576000,,959,4.201086956521739
1948396,5,B0000V46D6,"This groundbreaking series about a group of gay men living in Pittsburgh is great fun to watch.  Don't confuse it with reality, since all the characters spend the majority of their time at the gym, at the gay dance bar or having sex.  Too bad reality can't be like this!  Still it's enormously entertaining and extremely addictive.  I don't know how it goes over with heterosexuals, but all of my gay friends love it.",1091923200,,417,4.594594594594595

For those who felt that Season 2 lost its way and like me didn't appreciate all of the humour elements thrown in, this season brings the show firmly back down to earth.  It's grittier than ever and shows some of the characters' dark sides without being depressing.  The cast are as brilliant as ever, and the writing and direction still fresh.  I'm not one to spoil surprises, but we see the continuation of an unresolved plotline in Season 2, and the return of an old character from the first season.  Not telling you any more!

Well what are you waiting for?  Buy this set now!  It's the greatest television show ever made.",1090886400,,846,4.4
1948398,5,B0000V46D6,"I won't pretend to claim that Queer as Folk is all-around the most realistic show on television.  The British version of QaF tried that, and fizzled out at the end of its second season.  Reality, pure and undramatized, does not belong in a long-running television series.  Once you get to know the characters, how much pleasure can you really get out of watching people ferry between work and the pub day in and day out?
Queer as Folk is often criticized for its melodrama and insinuation (or perhaps, assumption by the public) that this is an attempt to portray the entire spectrum of gay life.  But I don't think pure reality was ever the intention, the goal was for exposure, acceptance, and entertainment.
While I agree that QaF is not as realistic or as beautifully written as Six Feet Under, I still prefer it for its superior characterization.  Some may argue that the characters are stereotypical, but I think those critics fail to pay enough attention to the individual personalities to see beyond the stereotype.  With that assumption, anyone could be viewed as stereotypical until you get to know them.  What I enjoy about QaF is that I can see my friends and family reflected in the characters of the show, whose personalities and dialogue are usually better differentiated than even Six Feet Under, and certainly more than a show like Friends, where 99% of the dialogue could be switched between speakers with absolutely no need to edit for style or content.
The character of Brian Kinney is far more complex than anything I've seen on television.  Anyone who regards him as a flat character, or views his seemingly selfless acts as uncharacteristic obviously doesn't really understand his character.  The fact that this complexity is built into the writing is all the more laudable, with characters understanding his true nature to varying degrees.  Characters like Emmett view Brian as a flat person while at the other extreme, Debbie is the only character who truly understands the way he thinks.  I find the show the most engaging as a dialogue on personality and human interaction.
And of course, I love the music.  Watching Queer as Folk has introduced me to a significant chunk of the new artists I presently listen to, and makes me feel at home in a world where the music industry and television networks seem transfixed on mediocrity and sameness in everything they produce.",1090281600,,2396,4.874384236453202
1948399,4,B0000V46D6,"Definitely better than season 2.  Ted becomes interesting, finally!  And Kinney gets a heart.  A surprising new role (or two) for Michael, Justin refuses to settle but then settles again...how long will that last, though?  The characters are moving forward in life, and it's a good thing. The bar scene is still active, but no longer the center of it all.  These people actually have lives.",1088899200,,390,4.848484848484849
1948400,3,B0000V46D6,"Alright now we're at Season Three, enough has been said of how SHOWTIME had come this far to make this totally queer, bold, or whatever awesome gay drama for the America's television - and also the gossips intercontinentally - I strongly feel the story has slowly lost its grisp to constantly ""thrill"" the constantly demanding DVD audience (especially those who spent 4 times utterly higher than the people earning DOLLARS in the states).
It's as if we've come to know Brian Kinney (more than enough as the number of smack bottoms he took back to his bourgeois loft), his (...) lucky pal Michael Novortny who seems to have it all, his custody shared longtime friend Lindsay and her absolutely perfect lesband Melanie, and his oh-so-predictable one-and-off whatevership with so called brighter-than-sunshine but bored-than-britney Justin Taylor. Enough crystal drama for the newly coupled Ted and Emmett, and definitely a big enough mouth for enough fabulous mama Debbie. Season Three also tend to consolate the gay activists by creating a win-win result over a election campaign, and add one more new member to the Diner's family, a teenage street hustler named Hunter, who came around a little rather imaginative for the storyline. However, not enough has been explored on a few members of this family.
I personally feel Melanie and Emmett are actually two potentially very explorable characters among the gang that would give the directors a good run of scripts. Melanie's coming strong in-your-face dyke attitude should be treated with a little extra indepth focus and Emmett's flamboyant outshell may as well worth a closer look. Just ask yourself, if the entire characters in the show were your real life friends, how much do you know about Melanie and Emmett after watching the Season One, Two, and Three? Do you know where they come from? The answer is no, see.",1088294400,,1868,5.048543689320389
1948401,4,B0000V46D6,"I was ready to give up on Queer as Folk after Season 2.  I'm tired of seeing how many positions, how many partners, how many ways Brian can have sex.  But this Season, amid Brian's constant need to quench his lust, there were storylines and plots that were interesting.  Emmet and Ted's relationship hits a rather rocky spot, from which there was no turning back.  Debbie's relationship also becomes strained....while Michael and his professor take in an HIV + hustler.  Brian has to deal with the consequences of his terrific work in advertising for a client who is bent on destroying Pittsburg's gay community.  There are plenty of things going on this season with the character's, including Lindsey and Mel, which made this season, though shorter, much more interesting for me.  I'd love to see the writers and directors back of the sexual content (not completely) but enough to focus more on the characters and other facets of the gay community.  It seems anytime they do focus on another part of the gay community (such as a bear/leather bar) it is with comtempt and negativity. Anyone who is gay or has gay friends know that ""Queer as Folk"" certainly doesn't emcompass the complete gay experience.  But for the next season it would be nice to see QAF expand their horizons beyond the pretty boys we see on a regular basis.
As far as the extra features, there is plenty there.  Photo galleries, a cool music video, behind the scenes with actors, etc.  Overall, if you are a fan of the show, you'll definitely wan to add this to your dvd library.  A season worth watching....let's hope they give us more story and less sex in Season 4!",1086134400,,1639,4.672473867595818
1948402,5,B0000V46D6,"""Queer As Folk"" continues entertaining audiences as proven in this DVD set.  When the show debuted on Showtime in 2000, many wondered how long it can maintain its surprise and shock value.  Before its debut, only ""Will And Grace"" and ""Ellen"" had expored GLBT issues to such heights.  This offered issues that the community can relate to.  It's since earned numerous nominations from the GLAAD (Gays, Lesbians, and Allies Against Defamination) Awards for Outstanding TV sitcom.  The third season proves that it sustains its great quality while comprising new and interesting ideas.  It expresses many views that many unfortunately consider taboo and places it into their faces in great magnitudes.  Such daring techniques earn the cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what many would never consider.  The third season explores numerous issues for the first time: politics, hustling, drug abuse, and others.  The brilliant plot continues to entertain audiences as it has in the past.
Those who have watched the first two seasons will notice some change in events and settings.  An unexpected hero arising to save a town from being led by a homophobic mayor candatite and crystal meth beginning to tumble the life of an unexpected man are only two events that will shock and mesmerize longtime fans.  Justin's break-up, the future of ""Rage"" comic book, and if best friends Ted and Emmitt's relationship blossoms into romance.  Viewers will notice a broader prospective on HIV/ AIDS as Ben suffers a life crisis after his friend/ ex-boyfriend dies of AIDS, leading to steroid use, and helps a 15-year-old hustler, later discovering they can relate to each other more than they planned.  Such chilling chain of events and others lead to a surprising conclusion that leaves audiences anxiously awaiting for season four.
The variety of personalities within the characters offer greater viewing entertainment.  Without it, ""Queer As Folk"" wouldn't have as much impact.  The actors express their individual character's traits wonderfully.  Michelle Clunie (Mel), Thea Gill (Lindsay), Robert Gant (Ben), Scott Lowell (Ted), Peter Paige (Emmitt), Gale Howard (Brian), Hal Sparks (Michael), Randy Harrison (Justin), and Sharon Gless (Debbie) star.  Their talents alone greatly express the characters' development throughout the season.
After viewing the whole season, those pleased with the DVD set should also watch the bonus features.  Kristine W.'s new music video is great to dance to.  The features and facts about the show's background and the creation are interesting.  Viewers will learn about the creation and the secrets of Babylon, the actors' history before and during the show, and more.  Specials on some actors' activism, participation in gay parades, autograph signing festivals offer more of their background on their acting influences.
""Queer As Folk"" third season edition proves that it will remain on the air for a while longer.  This series of episodes is sure to pleases audiences.  Those interested in this should watch the first and the second season first.  Otherwise, the chain of events will be confusing.",1084579200,,3126,5.306910569105691
1948403,5,B0000V46D6,"Everyone has a strong opinion on this show. I for one thoroughly enjoyed season 3.  My review, without spoilers:
Scott Lowell's performance as Ted addicted to crystal meth is outstanding.  Peter Paige also does a spectacular job as Emmitt, Ted's boyfriend, trying to deal with the addition.  This saga within the series is one of the best parts of season three.
That being said, I could have done without Hunter:  was he added to the show simply to have a twink on hand now that Justin is maturing?  Also, I would love to see just ONE episode where it isn't necessary for the cast to get their freak on at Babylon, the disco.
I cringe when I see the illicit, casual sex and casual drug use on the show.  I will respect the writers' decision to include it, as it's part of gay life.  But the writers could be more inclusive of the diversity of opinions in the community by adding a character that is opposed to casual sex and recreational drug use.

1948406,4,B0000V46D6,"I suppose you could add accusations of pedophila to the list as well.  Season Three featured a mere 14 episodes (disappointing after seasons 1 and 2).  At about 45 minutes per episode, then racks up to only 10 1/2 hours of the brilliant but pompous Brian, the beautiful Justin, the too often pathetic Ted, the delightful Emmett, ""Mel and Linds"" - the token lesbians, the too often winey Michael, professor Ben, the artful Ethan, street hustler Hunter, and of course the outraguous and outspoken Debbie.  Ok, so do I like it or not?  I love it!  Kudos to Showtime, and the performers for bringing what I refer to as ""ground-breaking television"".  Seasons 1 and 2 were riveting. Season 3 missed the mark, but I hold the producers and directors accountable for that.  The season lacked depth, seems as we never really reached deep into the story lines.  The ensemble cast is wonderful, and for the most part, we all know someone who fits each characters role - to some extent.  I've never met Ted in my life.  I was about to write this reveiw after seeing 13 of the 14 epsiodes - but decided to wait until I completed the 14th and final episode of Season 3 (I own the DVD collections and do not get Showtime).  Because, and almost only because of epsiode 14, I give the season 3 FOUR STARS.  Without, 3 at best.  Somehow, we finally got focused again on what this show is all about.  Love and life in the GLBT world.  Debbie's closing words to Emmett are the reason why we NEED Queer As Folk (don't read ahead if you haven't seen the show yet): ""Mourn the losses because they're many; but celebrate the victories because they're few"".  Another reason we need this show is to REMIND us what it is we are supposed to be doing - standing up and speaking out for our rights!  If we don't keep doing, someone WILL come along and take them away.  Support Queer As Folk, and support Showtime.  Though many episodes may not exactly portray your reality of gay life, remember this is only television, and television rarely portrays ""real life"" (especially those reality shows).  But in our culture, there are nightclubs, bathhouses (or back rooms), overbearing Moms, young people on the streets, people living with HIV, politicians who would rather see us dead, and so on.  Queer As Folk is reality and each show is a reminder of our community.  If you don't like the gratutious sex (and I for one could manage to see far less anonymous sex on the show), ask Showtime to produce a non-cable version.  Does all this sex happen in our community?  I don't know because I don't partake in it, but I beleive in many of our larger metro areas it does.  So indeed, it too is reality.  Buy, rent or borrow Queer As Folk - it's not only for gay men either!",1082419200,,2735,4.496957403651115
1948407,2,B0000V46D6,"As a middle-aged, intelligent, experienced gay man who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s and who has seen gay culture from all angles, Imust admit up front that I have never found QAF all that compelling or revelatory. Season ONE was good (for the most part) in its depiction of the emptiness and shallowness of gay bar culture (a fact which I am sure is mirrored in straight bar culture as well). The characters were introduced well and their interactions rang true. The more negative aspects of the bar scene were not glossed over, though I have always questioned more fervent supportersof the show why they feel this is a *good* thing for us. The bones I found to pipck were relatively minor: [(no characters involved in ANY spare time activity related to AIDS or to other charity; not a single major male character with facial hair (EXTREMELY unrealistic!!); no focus on gay men over 30 (a SERIOUS omission yet to be corrected); little or no focus on the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic.]
Season TWO started the downhill slide, with Ted's slide into the Internet porn business serving notice that dramatic creativity was going to take a back seat to titilation and an easy backdrop for puns and one-liners that would have made me cringe in high school. And the lesbians started their slow fade into the background - a fade that we all pretty much knew was coming...
But Season THREE I found truly incomprehensible - and ultimately insulting. The emphasis on venality and exploitation of others reached new highs (or lows, depending on your point of view) and I found nearly ALL of the characters becoming LESS likeable or worthy of respect.
A previous reviewer made salient points regarding the near-exclusive emphasis on sex and drugs in this series by its major male protagonists - a complaint that I echo strongly here. Certainly most of the sexual interaction in this series is gratuitous and does nothing to further either the character's development nor their relationships with others. (Certainly Brian is one of the most UNappealing gay characters I have ever encountered in any genre and his psychological motivations for his seeming 'against character' actions ring painfully false and contrived.) The drug use (apart from Ted's self-loathing-motivated descent) appears at random and fades away, to little effect or, seeming, purpose. Aside from Ben's actions in trying to 'save' the male prostitute, the characters are completely self-absorbed and narcissistic. The most appealing characters get little screen time or story lines. And it seems the easy road is taken regarding characterization - characters are either cardboard stereotypes or walk-ons who appear briefly, then fade away when no longer required, their story lines left dangling (Ethan).
The Titanic is approaching the iceberg at full speed. Season FOUR will determine whether the inevitable happens or whether there is a last-minute course correction that saves the ship and returns us to a more satisfying and realistic voyage through the complex world of gay friendship and relationships.
Hopefully, (...), the course correction will begin. But Season THREE stands as example of the need for some serious rethinking of the series AND its characters directions.",1082073600,,3239,5.101694915254237
1948408,1,B0000V46D6,"Showtime has claimed this show is groundbreaking. Season 1 was. Season 2 it became predictable. Season 3? Gilligan's Island had more value.
The writing and directing became pedestrian. I can't fault the actors for appearing bored. What they were given was laughable and embarrassing.
The show has a ""cult"" following comprised of mostly women. Not the audience that Showtime and the producers had expected. Unfortunately the show has turned into a bad nighttime soap opera with male nudity as it's claim to fame. It pretends to be tackling serious issues which are pertinent to the gay community, but ultimately does it in such a hackneyed way that these important issues become simply bad plot devices with little substance.
Often compared to ""Sex and the City"" it never rises to that level (no pun intended). The humor tends to be juvenile in nature and the friendships with little depth.
The actors have gained a certain amount of notoriety amongst the ""fans"" yet are, on the whole, unknown outside this show. Not a good sign for their future career moves.

The third season is all about growing up. I have read the reviews and I see people are upset by the ""dullness"" of the season when in reality it is the most exciting.
Season three shows every character growing and rounding out their characteristics and behaviors.
The character Brian begins to take a stand on what is important and though most people do not like him, I admit he and Melanie are my favorites.
Justin also takes a stand and this time he stands up to someone who hurts him. And as he says, ""Brian never made me promises, you did."" I think people have been forgetting that broken promises can be as heartbreaking as anything else.
Melanie and Lindsay this season take a very interesting turn. Lindsay becomes much more dominant and Melanie seems to have a new respect for her partner that shows in her decision making.
Onto Ted and Emmit. I adore Ted's character (he is most like the gay men I know, insecure but wonderful.) His dark fall into the world of drugs should be seen as acting gold. And Emmit's support of a lover and his own heartbreak (and career moves) are thrilling. Though he does seem to play the abused housewife.
Michael and Ben. Oh, what to say. This relationship grows the most this season. We see a loving couple grapple with issues from work to home and overcome them all. I adore both characters and this season shows their personalities in sync.

1948412,4,B0000V46D6,"QUEER AS FOLK: Season Three

(USA - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.78:1
Soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Justin's relationship with Ethan is compromised by his continued feelings for Brian, despite the fact that Brian is now working for a right-wing mayoral candidate whose 'family-friendly' policies have begun to affect the lives of everyone on Liberty Avenue. A brush with the law brings Ted's world crashing down, leading to a rift in his romance with Emmett, while Michael and Ben take responsibility for young street hustler Hunter, who complicates their lives. Mel and Lindsay decide to have another child, and Debbie struggles to gain justice for a gay teenager whose murder wasn't properly investigated or resolved.

Still potent and sexy, and still fired by a nice line in sarcastic wit, the third season of ""Queer as Folk"" is a marked improvement over the rudderless Season Two, with a greater emphasis on drama and social issues than ever before. There's still plenty of comedy (Hunter's first encounter with Brian is as funny as it is profane), and the raunch factor is as strong as always, but the stories are no longer dependent on mere shock value, and are linked by the machinations of a corrupt former cop whose political ambitions have a direct bearing on the lives of the central characters.

With only 14 episodes this time out (as opposed to 22 in Season One and 20 in Season Two), the narrative turns darker as it progresses, as various characters reach a crossroads in their relationships, and an unsolved murder leads to a series of dramatic revelations. Gale Harold still dominates proceedings as Brian, an ambiguous character whose contempt for the world is matched only by his love for the friends with whom he shares it, but the entire cast is given room to shine, and they seize the opportunity with a vengeance. In such a strong ensemble, Harris Allan (Hunter) stands out as the hardened hustler whose abrasive personality masks a profound desire for companionship and acceptance, while ultra-sexy Fabrizio Filippo - whose character (Ethan) demonstrated the greatest potential for recurrent storylines - is sadly wasted in a minor role which concludes rather too abruptly (still, you get to see him naked in Episode One!!). Elsewhere, Jack Wetherall (Vic), Makyla Smith (Daphne) and Sherry Miller (Justin's mom) make strong but fleeting appearances, and there are brief cameos from several other QAF alumni, including Dean Armstrong (Blake) and John Furey (Justin's dad). The scripts are stronger, tighter, and more focused than ever before, and the whole thing culminates in a glorious finale that's VERY different from previous seasons.

1948414,3,B0000V46D6,"A long time QAF fan, who is not priviledged enough to have premium channels, eagerly await the release of the latest season on DVD to find out what happens with some of the most cutting edge characters on television. It's hard to not find out tidbits of that season's developments, from reading messages boards to friend's gossip. Finally, after viewing all episodes of season three, I must admit to be both stunned and somewhat disappointed in this season.
First, the disappointments. Without going into specifics, season three starts out very strong with the amazing ending of season two, yet the promises made at the end weren't necessarily fulfilled in this season. There is somewhat of a let down with two major stories, and another one, involving Ben and Michael, that seemed very out of place with the series.
Also, both season one and two had ""big episodes"" where everything seemed to soar above the series, for example Michael's birthday party, season two's wedding and Rage party. Season three offered nothing of that caliber, which was sorely missed.
But, that is also part of the brilliance of season three. First, the direction of the episodes is nothing short of brilliant. I suppose you aren't supposed to notice the directing if you are involved with the story, but I simply couldn't resist seeing these episodes as mini-movies. The direction is cutting edge and astounding. Each episode seemed tailored to match the directing with the plot, and the effect mesmerized me.
Based on the plot of the story, many of the actors soared in their performances too. Scott Lowell as Ted should be recongized ans awarded for his amazing turn as Ted's decends into darkness this season. It wasn't easy to watch, but Lowell nailed it.  His compatriot, Peter Paige plays Emmett both with strength and compassion, giving his character a new and much needed edge than we've ever seen before. And add new character ""Hunter"", newcomer Harris Allen gives an edge to the show, who is extremely convincing.
In watching this season, I was mixed on my feelings about it, up until the amazing final episode where it finally seems that the gang on Liberty Avenue seems to be back. I suggest giving season three a chance, watch it, let the great directing and acting wash over you, and spend some time with some amazing characters played by equally amazing actors.",1078531200,,2354,4.8997493734335835
1948415,5,B0000V46D6,"Recently released on DVD, Queer As Folk's third season continues to be a powerful and moving series. Our beloved friends and characters have moved on in their lives, and this season is a turning point for many of them. I do not want to spoil the plot for those still waiting to see this, but be prepared to see a changed Brian, a fun-loving but tougher Justin, Emmett and Ted's turmoil and a new life for the lesbian duo. Of course, this show would be incomplete without Debbie, dinner-diva. There is also a new character on the scene, young Hunter, who brings about a much-needed improvement to Michael's worrying wallflower attitude.
The season spans over the duration of a political campaign for a new mayor of Pittsburg, and the lives of all characters are directly and indirectly affected by the ex-police chief and running candidate Stockwell. Interspersed with serious themes and events are charming scenes, nightclubs, sex, drugs, love, work, school and all the other things that form part of daily life. Of course, the sex is what stands out for a lot of people, but after the first two episodes, this becomes more like background music and the camera hones in on the characters.
Certainly, the sheer abundance and exposure of sex and drugs is what makes this show edge and ""out there"". The producers are careful, however, to show the unglamorous aspects as well as the glamorous ones and don't view the world through rose-tinted glasses. It's realistic, it's in-your-face and it's powerful.
It's really too bad that there isn't more of it. Season 1 and 2 had at least 20 episodes, this one has only 14 - so you're getting less for your money, although the quality remains high (and the music fantastic). The box set does come with lots of extras, both for the DVD and computer. You get to see some documentaries and other surprises.

Although the story line is not your typical gay lifestyle, this show is ground breaking and will pave the way for future shows to show more realistic views. It's important to get peoples attention, and I think this show has done that.

The storylines in season 3 were incredible, and completely different from plots we have seen from Queer as Folk in the past.  From the Stockwell storyline, to Ted's sudden fallout, the writers and directors presented us with new sides to these characters, placing them in positions we haven't seen from them in the past.  Who would have thought about Ted becoming an addict?  Or a surprise return of a character that we never thought we'd see again?  Who would think of Brian sacrificing everything for what he felt was right?  We also got to see Ben and Michael become responsible parents, and Melanie get pregrant.  There were depths and thought to these storylines that were incredibly engaging, interesting, and emotional.

I think the way gays are depicted in this show, moreso, Season 3, is RIDICULOUS. According to THIS show gay men have 2 goals in life: SEX & DRUGS.  Soooooooooo not true. This season of QAF was so awful, that I will NOT be tuning in to season 4. What I found most offensive about the 3rd season, was the LONG played out storyline that focused on Brian & Justin fighting to have the ""sex rooms"" in the rear of that club, to not be closed down. How disgusting is that????  Ok- Justin & Brian weren't happy about the mayor doing this- we get the point. But did this need to be a major storyline point for Season 3?
For a show that had a promising start, QAF went downhill pretty fast. I thought ""Queer eye for the straight guy"" was a horrible depiction of how gays are viewed.

Season 3 even though it was shorter, did alot of things with the lives of the characters & storylines. Justin deals with making a decision only to have it blow up in his face (Ethan) & then decides that he wants Brian. Justin also realises that Brian does love him, but Brian doesn't have to say it. Because Brian always showed him that. Actions speak louder than words. I feel like Justin matured even more in this season. Ted turns into Blake pretty much & gets addicted to crystal which obviously devestates Emmett. We watch Ted's actions tear apart his and Emmett's relationship as well as his relationship with his friends. The whole season will have you in suspense with the whole Stockwell case. Brian is helping Stockwell, the biggest homophobic candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh, get elected. But in the end, well I won't give it away. But from episode one to fourteen, there are no fillers, just lots and lots of great episodes that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. The cast is as amazing as ever, they all have such amazing chemistry together. Plus season 3 is where Brian & Justin reunite for one of the best Queer As Folk episodes ever. There's just alot of big AND little things that happened in this season that make it just as solid as seasons one and two even though it was alot shorter. Season 3 is definetly a bridge between being boys and becoming men. Alot happens here, alot of drama, alot of humor, alot of heartache, alot of fabulous music...something you can expect from a great show like QAF. It definetly has earned its rightful place in gay and television history. Season 3 is a musthave for QAF fans. I reccomend it for everyone. You'll love it!

I was hooked..  have since saved up my pennies over the year for each dvd release.  and have never regretted it...  the episodes are the lives of emmette honeycut (pornstar turned caterer), ted schmit (old reliable ted goes through some changes in life in this season, not to be missed), brian kinney (self centered yet secretly giving horn dog),hunter (a teenage male prostitute who michael and ted are trying to save from the streets), michael novotny(""semi cute boy next door type, 29, 9 and a half cut, alright maybe im exagerating but whos told the truth since they invented cyber sex"" michael-ep. 1 se. 1"" <come on, you gotta see these before you even think about diving in head first into the third and the second season , well, if you see the first you won't be able to sleep till you see the second because QAF ALWAYS leaves you hanging so itll bug you till you start your new season>),ben (great guy, build like a brick... ok have to cencor out that one, hes pos which was rough on things at first but after season two we all knew that ben was gonna be a regular, everyone loved him too much), debbie (hard and nails, heart of mush, this strait ladys so gay, shell make ya blush), melanie and lindsey (melanie is an ex biker dyke turned lawyer and theres lindsey, her stay at home mom wife.. so cute..  you gotta love em), justin taylor(justins a brat but you wanna just pick him up and swing him around in the air, and then theres times where you wanna slap him, and theres times you want to pat the boy on the back. his character grew up on the show from 17-19, hes headin on 20.. hes brians man. and debbies ""sunshine"", ethan gold (eek, im not even getting into him..  i don't like ethan..), uncle vic (michaels pos uncle, ive heard rumors of whats gonna happen in 4 and i hope their rumors, someone told me that vics gonna die in the next season, i love vic, if the writers read this stuff don't kill off my guy), jennifer (justins mom aside from his other non biological mama debbie, i don't think theres anything jennifer wouldnt do for her boy.  one second shes confused and scared, the next shes trying to break through his shell and by the second season you see them walking down liberty avenue marching together for p flag ""im proud of you justin"" ""im proud of you too mom"" you gotta love jennifer), and gus, melanie and lindseys kid who is also brians biological son....

1948427,4,B0000V46D6,"At first I was appalled that the season was only 14 episodes...
However, that ebing said, i think it was incredible and agreat decision.  It took away some of the fluff from season two... if they had tried for 20 episodes, there would have beena  lot of filler, which is what happened to season two.  It could have used a little more stuff in there true... some more of the stuff that season one made us expect - but this season i think was good.  it had some of the best developed characters we have seen yet, and it didn't fill up hour long chunks of time killers so that the story lines would stretch over 8 more episodes.  they probably could have had 2 more episodes and still don't a great job, and i am not 100% sure i like everything that happened in the season... i cant stand hunter at all, the actor OR the character... but thats OK.... overall I think the 3 season was testament that QAF is not a hit and run hit, and will be around for a little while longer, at the least...",1069372800,,987,4.173684210526316
1948428,1,B0000V46D6,"Upon watching my first episode of Queer As Folk Season 1, I was immediately hooked.  By the time I saw the first episode, Season 2 was already underway.  I immediately bought the Season 1 DVDs and proceeded to watch all five DVDs in the space of 2 days.  It was just that addictive. I was impressed by the show's bold and astonishingly frank portrayal of a gay group of friends.  The relationship between Brian and Michael was really engaging.  I mean, here are ""best friends"" who loved each other as friends, but had an underlying attraction for each other.  I couldn't turn away.  I eagerly awaited more episodes. I was glued to the TV on Sunday nights.  My friends and family called me ""Queer as Folk"" addicted.  I was.
Season 2, was not as good.  Like most of the other reviewers, I  did not care for Michael and Ben as a couple.  Michael and David were so much more realistic. Plus, the season was shorter.  It was in this season that I started noticing how much smaller Babylon was becoming. It was not the hip & hopping club it used to be. Heck, in this Season, Queer as Folk wasn't what it used to be.  However, it was still worth staying up late on Sundays to catch. Which is more than I can say for Season 3.
Season 3, was by far the worst I have ever seen.  It was just plain awful.  I found myself taping the shows to watch later, which I've always done, but retaping over the episodes, which I never did. They were just that bad.  The storylines were boring and just plain uninteresting.  However, the absolute worst was what they did to Brian and Michael. Season 3, they barely had a friendship, much less any type relationship.  Am I the only one who sees that these two guys belong together?????????
Take my advice, get Season 1 and forget about Seasons 2 & 3.",1069113600,,1776,4.359756097560975
1948429,5,B0000V46D6,"I was pleased to see QAF take a more serious turn in season three.  Season one was excellent in establishing the characters and taking the viewers on a fun ride.  Season one had a mix of both funny scenes and serious scenes.  Season two started off good but soon became kooky and the storylines didn't hold any water.  In season three, Peter Paige and Scott Lowell shined.  Aswell, Gale Harold continued to deliver.  The storylines were interesting and it was nice to see some serious issues brought up and others wrapped up.  I was impressed with the the third season.",1068681600,,569,4.63
1948430,1,B0000V46D6,"Everything that made QAF  unique and special during the first 2 seasons was ruined in Season 3.  For me QAF gave us a no holds barred look at (Gen-X) life, was true to life and was politically in-correct.  But that all changed this season. It  was all over the place, it lacked pacing, a coherent plot, the stories were forced, contrived and it was politically correct.
First of all it was boring,  For some of the episodes I found myself forward fasting through  scenes of characters I didn't care for.  I never did this in Season 1& 2 (with the exception of the graphic sex scenes).
I wasn't certain how the Stockwell story was going to play out at first. I found it really neat that Brian was bonding with this politician who was on the other end of the political spectrum on him. I wasn't quite certain whether Brian was falling for Stockwell or maybe just saw in him the father he never had. Whatever it was I just thought that it was neat that for once Brian was bonding with a guy on his level without the usual wall of arrogance he hides behind.  Then the writers got what I call ""politically correct"" by having Brian and the rest of the gang turn on Stockwell. Yes the guy was a conservative. But the term ""fascist"" was a bit extreme and un called for.  The characters in the story wanted tolerance however they had absolutely none for anyone who did not think the way that they did. I found the whole thing rather hypocritical.  It also added to the inconsistency of the whole plot. First of all Brian is the one who approached Stockwell to work for him, despite knowing that Stockwell was a conservative politician. He even went back to Stockwell to try to help his campaign after, Stockwell fired him.  Something I never thought that a proud and arrogant man like Brian would do.  THEN he tries to bring down tries to bring Stockwell down.  Going so far as to torpedo his career (which he went to great lengths to salvage last season) and why does Brian do all this? Because he can't have sex in a public place.  How lame is that? It looked as if the creators thought that it was a pretty lame excuse as well. Which is why they seemed to turn to bringing  down Stockwell on the basis of his covering up a murder. Which again adds to the inconsistency from last season since I distinctly remember Brian's reaction last year at seeing ""Dumpster Boy's"" dead body. He smirks and flippantly says ""Let's go eat"" (or something to that effect). He obviously didn't care about the dead boy before, he does now?
I also hated the abrupt ending of the relationship between Justin and Ethan. It was as if the creators simply wanted Ethan out of the picture, so they had him cheat on Justin.  Which I found strange considering the amount of love and affection he showed Justin in the first place. I guess I am probably the only person who doesn't like Brian and Justin together. As much as I respect Randy Harrisson as an actor. He is not exactly the most virile man around. I would have really preferred for Brian to be with a guy more on his level (like David from season 1). Randy and Fabio (Ethan) had way much more chemistry.
Surprisingly what saved me this season were  my least favorite characters. Ben and Ted.
I never liked Robert Gant. I found his performances wooden and unispiring. He looks as if he should be acting on a day time soap.  However I really enjoyed him reaching out to Hunter and trying to help him.  It was done in a very realistic and non-sappy way.  The same for Ted's issue with drugs.  This was probably the best anti-drug storyline I've ever seen. Since it actually showed us why Ted turned to them-to hide from the loathing he feels for himself.  Ted is not my favorite character on this show, but if I had to say who had the best and most realistic storyline this season it had to be him.
And it was too bad that Lindsey and Melanie weren't used much more.
If the creators can't think of anything more original to come up with then perhaps it is time to just cancel the show after season 4. I don't know if QAF is back for a 4th season but I truly hope they clear up the mess from this year.",1067990400,,4123,4.3620915032679735
1948431,4,B0000V46D6,"The phenomenon is back!""Queer as Folk"" returns with 14 episodes that won't please everyone,but is still a great ride anyway. Season 3 standout performances include Scott Lowell & Peter Paige,who characters,Ted & Emmett,finally revealed their love for each other at the end of season 2. A love that is threatened when terrible things begin to happen to Ted,leading to one of the series most shocking moments ever,and the return of an old love. More kudos to Robert Gant and Hal Sparks whose characters,Ben & Michael,decide to live together with unexpected results.with all its faults,season 3 still manages to to be better than expected,a sure step up from season 2,but two steps back from season 1.

1948432,5,B0000V46D6,"QUEER AS FOLK is still one of the most amazing TV Shows ever and is a landmark as the show for the new millennium. This New Queer As Folk Season 3 DVD Box Set has all 14 episodes of the third season of one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: Behind-the-camera, Hot Summer Days, Wrap Party Reel, Enter Babylon LA, Meet the Folks, Animated Photo Gallery, Season Four Sneak Preview, Weblink, Music Videos, and a few other surprises.  I have seen all 14 episodes of Season 3 and it is another great season with some major twists. I am a little upset that this season is very short when compared to season 1 and 2, which both had about 7 or 8 more episodes, but either way it is still a good season. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Not every gay person lives a life like these guys, and I sure don't but thats not what this show is about. Queer As Folk ia about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think. Watch more than one episode before you judge this amazing series. I would just like to say Queer As Folk Season 1 and 2 are also great to own. I will be in line when they release Season 3 of Queer As Folk on DVD in February 2004.",1067299200,,2029,4.0725
