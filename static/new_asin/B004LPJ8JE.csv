8434571,5,B004LPJ8JE,"Very good video. Nothing fancy, just great hunting info modestly presented...which is a refreshing rarity in outdoor stuff these days. I've heard  plenty of Benoit hunting stories over the years from folks who have hunted the same ground and everyone in the know respects what they do. The naysayers are universally people who have no firsthand experience and once you ask a few questions it's apparent there is alot of jealousy at work.
Kudos for these guys who do what they do so well and are willing to share it without gouging you for the last nickel!
This type of hunting requires more unposted ground than most areas have, but you should be able to take a few tricks from their play book to help you wherever you hunt. That's what it's all about...continually striving to improve your performance afield, as a hunter, sportsman, and be woodswise.",1426982400,,852,4.795918367346939
