3424861,4,B001989ZEY,"Included on MILL CREEK's ALFRED HITCHCOCK: STUDIES IN FEAR are three of the great director's silent-era classics. ""The Lodger"" is taken from the earliest book to offer a solution to the Jack the Ripper case. ""Easy Virtue"" (based on a Noel Coward play) is about a divorcee who flees a public scandal (an artist in love with her commits suicide). While in France she meets and marries a man whose family discovers her dark secret. ""The Ring"" was a departure for Hitchcock. It's a well-done boxing film, scripted by the director himself.

Also among these British-era AH photoplays:
""Jamaica Inn"" concerns a gang of land-based pirates. Its solid cast includes Maureen O'Hara in her screen debut.
""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" is an espionage nail-biter that features both a kidnapping and an assassination plot
""Juno and the Paycock"" is the saga of an Irish family's rags-to-riches-to-rags journey. (From the Sean O'Casey play.)
""Sabotage"" is Hitch at his best. A Scotland Yard detective tries to catch a saboteur who plans to explode a bomb in London.
""Young and Innocent"" is a mistaken identity story. A man wrongfully arrested for his girlfriend's murder escapes and goes on the run.
""Number Seventeen"" is the address of a gang of theives' hideout. They are tracked to their safehouse by a detective.
""The Skin Game"" is a battle between two families over land in a village that nearly destroys both of them.

3424862,3,B001989ZEY,Not one of Hitchcock's best films or Jessie Matthews but quite an enjoyable romp all the  same.,1417046400,,95,4.588235294117647

3424864,3,B001989ZEY,"I don't know where this print came from, but it is spectacular. The images are pristine. The movie was very nicely photographed, which adds immeasurably to the overall viewing experience. That said, the movie is a true oddity, an Alfred Hitchcock movie with virtually nothing in it to signify that he was the director. In fact, the only thing I can think of that would tip anyone off to the fact that a major talent was behind the camera is the overall excellence of the direction. From beginning to end, I was always aware that a major talent was at work. That doesn't make this a good picture by any means, but it does save it from being bad. I think the best way to enjoy this title is to go in expecting to see a well-made costume drama and nothing more, and also to be able to cross it off the list of Hitchcock movies that you haven't seen. The acting is fine throughout, and the male lead is actually quite charming and appealing, but unfortunately the plot is hokey at best. Overall, not a bad movie, but not much above mediocre either. A true curiousity. I give the print transfer the highest rating possible, because it truly is fine. If you've ever wanted to see early Hitchcock, I highly recommend that you purchase this specific DVD. You probably won't care much for the movie itself, but you'll be amazed at how good it looks.",1351382400,10,1340,4.451219512195122
3424865,4,B001989ZEY,"Even though there's no mention of this on the product page, prospective purchasers should be aware that this is a recorded DVD-R, and not a factory-pressed DVD.  So it won't last forever.  (Not that glass-stamped DVDs will last forever; the glue holding the various layers together will eventually degrade, but probably not during the lifetime of anyone reading this.  But the photosensitive dye in a DVD-R is likely to degrade far sooner; depending on the quality of the blank DVD-R and storage conditions, anywhere from several decades to a few years.  Such is life.)

That being said, it is indeed a surprisingly high-quality print ... of a film for Hitchcock completists only.  Seriously, unless you've set out on a mission to watch everything Hitch ever did (which is not as crazy an idea as it sounds, unless it is ... anyway, that's why I bought *my* copy), there's really not much reason to see this one, an opinion shared by Hitch himself.

But yeah, if you've decided that you need to see ""Waltzes From Vienna,"" this is a fine way to do that.",1340582400,5,1052,4.715846994535519
3424866,4,B001989ZEY,"After - or before, actually - the hordes of films made about the great composers that distort their lives and their music as well, this is really rather quiet and effective.  Of course the love interest is piled up as with all the rest but this was toned down.  His secret of ""The Blue Danube"" was of course no ""secret weapon"" at all but an enormously popular piece of music that won the people over at its debut. In all, this film managed to respect its subject and his music without gross overstatement and that in itself is somewhat of a miracle.",1334361600,4,549,4.372549019607843
3424867,5,B001989ZEY,"Some don't realize that Alfred Hitchcock showed his genius early in the silent cinema era. Downhill is a fascinating tale of an innocent Ivy League colllege boy who is accused of forcing himself on a young woman. He is expelled and rejected by his wealthy father. The college boy, played by Ivor Novello then leaves home, soon his world goes downhill. First he takes an acting job and the lead actress marries him for the money he inherited from his aunt. Then he gets a job as a dime-a-dance boy in a cheap dance hall catering to lonely women past their prime. Finally he winds up a delusional drunk by the docks. This is an intersting film firstly as how it tiptoes around the delicate subject of sex. We are never told explicitly what happened to the girl that accuses Ivor Novello's character. Was she raped? Is she pregnant? It's all very vague probably due to censorship at the time. The other interesting is of course Hitchcock's technique. There are interesting camara angles and montages. The second film on this dvd is The Loger, also starring Ivor Novello. There is a serial killer running around London that preys on young blondes. Enter Ivor, a mysterious stranger, wh is soon suspected of being the killer. It's a good movie and I think the important one of the important elements of this film is the lodger's initial appearance. He has his face half covered to look sinister, a technique I believe inspired the initial scene of Bela Lugosi as Dracula when he arrives as the coachman.",1333238400,4,1498,4.678030303030303

3424869,5,B001989ZEY,"This is a review of the PR Studios release of Hitchcock's ""Waltzes from Vienna"".

The print of this movie is in great shape, both audio and video.  As for the movie itself it is somewhat silly; obviously not your typical Hitchcock picture, even when comparing it to his other early 1930s films.  The movie is interesting to watch and worth buying if you're interested in Hitchcock's films, especially since this title never shows up on TV.",1292025600,15,439,4.75
3424870,2,B001989ZEY,"I was taken back by how stripped-down the packaging appeared with so little description on the back, just ""Title: Alfred Hitchcock's 'Waltzes From Vienna' Studio: PRS Release Date: December 9 2009 Disc: DVD"" and a barcode.
The start of the movie merely had a start button. There were no chapters or setup links. Even the Warner Archive DVDs are better than this.  It played fine & the quality was passable, considering the movie's age.
I've never bought an illegal copy of anything. Is this how they look? It makes me uneasy to own it.",1277596800,4,535,4.691489361702128

All were made during his early phase in England with Jamaica Inn being the last production he made in England before Selznick asked him to come to Hollywood.
