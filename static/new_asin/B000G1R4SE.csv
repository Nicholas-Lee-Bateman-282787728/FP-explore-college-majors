2598682,5,B000G1R4SE,"Without my little sister, I would never have discovered the Gilmore Girls, and my life would have been much less colorful. Instead, I now have all six DVDs (Seasons 1-6) and have seen each episode at least twice. This is a family show to LOVE. Hollywood doesn't make TV shows like this much any more.  Gilmore girls is in a darling class all by itself.

For our sake, I hope it will never go off the air!",1175472000,,404,4.233766233766234
2598683,5,B000G1R4SE,"I first started watching syndicated re-runs of the 4th season on the Family channel on cable because Jared Padalecki from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supernatural-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000FP2OPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supernatural - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;was in it. As I watched it, it really began to grow on me.  I started wanting to see the other seasons, and I decided to invest in the DVDs so that I could watch Rory grow and see how all of their relationships began and ended so that I could appreciate what I had seen even more.

I recommend this to anyone from teens to grandmothers.  My husband has even gotten into watching the episodes with me as I curse at Lorelai and Rory for making those crazy decisions about boys and then forgiving them as they mourn in their own ways. I think that every girl can see a little bit of the Gilmore Girls in themselves, and can enjoy living vicariously with them in Stars Hollow.",1174953600,3,999,5.391025641025641
2598684,5,B000G1R4SE,The Amazon group put every effort together and a get the item sooner than i expected. This Collections in Puerto Rico cost me like 60 a season. I save more than $150.,1169251200,,166,4.21875
2598685,5,B000G1R4SE,Best price available on the net or in stores.  Quickly delivered.,1168473600,,65,4.909090909090909
2598686,5,B000G1R4SE,Excellent series that addresses important subjects in an intelligent and humourous way that sparks interesting discussions at home. Perhaps the relationship between mom and daughter is a bit too idyllic from time to time - but there are still plenty of things to talk about and lots of laughs to be had.,1168473600,,303,4.846153846153846
2598687,5,B000G1R4SE,"LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!  LOVE IT!!  MY daughter introduced me to the show in the 4th season, and honestly I would watch it, but was never really into it.  I bought her the Season 1-6 boxed set for her birthday.  The entire family sat down to watch the 1st disk with her.  We all became instantly addicted! (Including my husband!) He loves the dialog and pop culure references! The show is well written, quick witted, funny, heartwarming, and ADDICTING!  Be ready to watch disk after disk.  It took us only a couple of weeks to watch all 6 seasons!",1167782400,3,543,4.424242424242424
2598688,5,B000G1R4SE,"Smart, funny, heartwarming, characters that are believable and lovable.  Excellent quality for the entire family.",1167782400,,113,6.533333333333333
2598689,5,B000G1R4SE,"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious, dramatic, romantic, girly show about a thirty-something year old Lorelei (Lauren Graham) who got pregnant at 16. Her daughter, Rory, (Alexis Bledel)is smart, ambitious, and beautiful. The show basically follows them as Lorelei struggles with her love life and career (running an Inn) and as Rory goes from prestigious high school to ivy league college. She too, struggles with her love life and schoolwork. Dozens of other quirky characters are mixed into this witty show, making it funny, heartwarming, and frankly quite addicting. I highly reccomend Gilmore Girls. But just be prepared for hundreds of clever pop culture references throughout every episode!",1155600000,15,689,5.4485981308411215
8128626,5,B000G1R4SE,"Awesome series. The only thing is that it says first 6 seasons when in fact all 7 were sent to me. Which is great, but now when the 7th season that I ordered separately arrives I have to send it back.",1514505600,,200,3.902439024390244
8128627,3,B000G1R4SE,"I was so excited to receive these in the mail. Sadly, when I went to put the first disc in of season 1, it did not work at all. All of the others work well except for that one. Needless to say, it was a bit frustrating.",1486944000,,219,3.6808510638297873
8128628,5,B000G1R4SE,"I love this show as much as I love chocolate (which is saying a lot). It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and you can really connect with the characters. I recomend this for any grandmother, mother or daughter because this show is great for any age. although, I do have to warn you that it may cause a sudden urge to drink coffee. I think that what I love the most about this show is all of the refernces that they make in every episode. This show is so perfectly put together that I don't know how it could be any better.",1352332800,,523,4.038461538461538

I emailed the seller they said they would send out a new one and trace the original, neither product ever came and I never heard anything back from them about tracing the original. I am now trying to get my money back!",1306368000,,243,4.304347826086956

8128631,3,B000G1R4SE,"Dear Sir,
Unfortunately, I have had a bad experience with this item, as I am a fan of the series, after ordering and receiving all seasons from Amazon and while watching the 5th season, I passed through an unpleasant experience as there was a duplication in one of the DVDs within the 5th season and namely it was the 5th disc in that season that was duplicated. Unfortunately i have missed on all the episodes on the 6th DVD of the 5th season and hence lost track of the events in the series. I hope this can be rectified from your side in a certain way, as I have really lost track of events, and now the rest of the series does not fall in place because of those missing episodes on the 6th DVD of the 5th season. I hope this can be rectified.
Looking forward to a feedback.
Thank you",1219276800,,787,4.184210526315789
8128632,5,B000G1R4SE,A must have for young and old alike. The best drama and comedy on T.V. In my opinion the best hmour and drama ever seen on T.V. Alexia Bledel(Rory) and Lauren Graham(Lorelai) are both terrific actors. Stars Hollow is a great fantasy place to live. I would move their in a split second.,1211328000,,285,4.39622641509434

8128634,5,B000G1R4SE,"This was purchased as an anniversary gift for my wife.  She only stops watching to work and sleep. She's already finished seasons 1 -4, and is almost done with season 5! It was perfect.  Excellent product.  The only glitch was the first shipment sent was on VHS, but that was corrected and the DVD's arrived in time for our anniversary.  Well Done Amazon!",1181260800,2,355,4.587301587301587
8128635,5,B000G1R4SE,"I thoroughly enjoyed Gilmore Girls.  Delightful.  Heartwarming.  Funny.

The only suggestion I have is NOT to involve in the story line current or non-current political issues or leanings. It spoiled some of the enjoyment. It should be a story to solely entertain.  I got through the political areas, but it did disappoint, no matter what political viewpoint one holds.  Otherwise, I, for the most part, did enjoy.  Look forward to the final

season 7 offering.",1179964800,,461,5.053333333333334
