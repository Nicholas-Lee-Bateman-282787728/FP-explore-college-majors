8317247,4,B001L4L986,Not bad. Covers most of Dorothy's life including some real time footage not seen before. Would be nice if these were from the masters or cleaned up a bit.,1456617600,,154,4.344827586206897

8317250,5,B001L4L986,"This short documentary gave me a few new insights into this beautiful,  forgotten and overlooked star. She laid the groundwork for today's black actresses. Although her life circumstances were indeed tragic, her films, nightclub appearances and music live on.",1409011200,,259,5.641025641025641
8317251,5,B001L4L986,Ok,1406073600,,2,2.0
8317252,3,B001L4L986,"If you are a Dorothy Dandridge fan, you are going to like this movie although there may be very little content that you have not seen elsewhere.  This movie seems to have been put together and edited quickly for distribution. I believe if more thought and patience would have gone into the creative process of splicing and editing, this would be a much better visual presentation of the Magnificent Dottie D. However, buy this movie anyway as a tribute (and you will if you are a true fan), for the beautiful daughter, actress, wife, mother and trailblazer that is Dorothy Jean Dandridge from Cleveland, Ohio.",1326844800,,609,4.8
8317253,2,B001L4L986,"This DVD documentry doesn't cover anything already known about Dorothy Dandridge.
The clips and narration seem cheaply put together and the video quality is very poor.  However, it does provide some rare movie clips that may not have been shown before.  If you just looking for more stuff about Dorothy to own then I would suggest it, otherwise it is not a good purchase.",1282608000,3,371,4.78125
8317254,3,B001L4L986,"It's all been said before, although there are a couple of new numbers missing in the Passport original.  When will someone retrieve Dorothy's showstopping nightclub scene from ""Remains to be Seen"" (1953) and share it with her adoring fans like me?",1257552000,6,247,5.024390243902439
