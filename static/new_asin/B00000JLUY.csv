7912658,3,B00000JLUY,"This tape reviews the 1998 season when they only won 4 games.  I enjoyed the tape, but I think only cause I love the Rams so much.  I have all the St.louis Rams Highlight tapes and they are all pretty interchangable.  Infact, when I watch them, sometimes forget which one I'm seeing. They keep  using a lot of the same music. The defense in 1998 played well and if they  had any offense, they would have won a lot more games, as the 1999 season  proves.  The tape starts out by showing clips of Faulk, Green, and Holt  before they joined the team. Then the season highlights.  The Rams beat 3  playoff teams and should have beaten the Vikings. The tape shows lots of  clips from the games they did win. It's nothing special, but I enjoyed  seeing replays of the interceptions and sacks the Defense made. It's a  highlight tape, so they don't mention Banks and his fumbles and Kennisons  hands of stone. I say, buy it if you love the Rams. If you don't, you're not  missing much. I know you will buy next years tape for sure, so this tape is  a nice contrast to compare how the Rams went from worst to first.",945907200,10,1107,4.27536231884058
