8261444,5,B001675YTI,"An insightful look into the Kansas 2008 National Championship run.  While they glazed over some of the more emotional bits like Darnell's senior speech moment about wishing he could trade bodies with his mom (she had been in a horrific car accident, and later committed suicide because of the pain), it was still an overall amazing experience to relive the magic of that season.",1366761600,,378,4.90625
8261445,2,B001675YTI,"I was looking for a copy of the entire final game.  Although I knew up front this was not the whole game I was a bit disappointed in the video.  It lacked and did not convey the magic any excitement of that final.  It is not a bad video, but not something I've watched more than once.",1313712000,,284,3.9473684210526314
8261446,5,B001675YTI,"If you are a Kansas Jayhawk fan... GET this.

It is about an hour long... it has a few highlights, but it really goes over the whole year.

You will also want to get the DVD of the Games vs. Memphis and UNC.

What a great year 2008 was!",1244073600,,236,3.7755102040816326
8261447,5,B001675YTI,"If you are any kind of a Jayhawk fan of any age, you will LOVE this movie.  It documents the whole championship season of the Jayhawks and has great interviews from the team members.  A great buy I will watch over and over.",1218240000,3,223,4.162790697674419
8261448,5,B001675YTI,This is a fine DVD on the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team. I do not see any reason not to give it a five star rating (one individual previously rated it one star).  I live in Oklahoma so I have no prejudice for giving the Jayhawks a five star rating.  This unselfish team of fine young men were certainly deserving of winning the NCAA Basketball Championship!,1214784000,2,359,4.507692307692308
8261449,4,B001675YTI,"This DVD is a must for any KU fan. It is great season highlights, clips of great KU shots, interviews, behind the scenes. What it doesn't have is the complete KU/ North Carolina Semi Final game. For this game it only has some highlights.",1214438400,4,237,4.409090909090909
