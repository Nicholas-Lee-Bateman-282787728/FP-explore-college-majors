2205664,5,B0007989HU,Dora and her freinds are great. I love the fact that there are more than just one show. Very funny and great for learning. Such a positive program for my 16 month old daughter. She knows a few words now in spanish and loves to sing with Dora.,1127779200,2,242,4.0625
2205665,4,B0007989HU,"""I'm going to be a big sister!"" sings Dora!  Dora the Explorer becomes a big sister, and she's so excited about it that she wants to tell everyone how much she is looking forward to meeting the baby!  As usual, the episode features an expedition with the help of Boots the Monkey, Backpack and the Map.

Dora and Boots rush home after getting the news from Papi that her new baby brother or sister is on the way.  Dora and Boots sing songs about being a big sister that emphasize the need to be ""really good at caring"", and ""really good at sharing"".

Dora's enthusiasm about becoming a big sister is very encouraging to little Dora fans who are themselves about to become a big sister.  We, in fact, bought this DVD for our daughter a few months before our second daughter was due to arrive.  It truly helped get her excited about her upcoming role as ""big sister"".  She began singing the songs and proudly telling everyone that she was going to be a big sister ""just like Dora"".

I was, however, disappointed by the fact that Dora's new brother and sister (yes, Dora's mom has twins) are bottle fed.  Mothers who are passionate about breastfeeding and breastfeeding advocacy might not appreciate the bottle-feeding imagines and references in the episode.

The DVD also includes several other episodes that are fun and entertaining, but do not include Dora's new siblings:  ""Dora Saves the Game"", ""Job Day"" and ""A Letter for Swiper.""",1121126400,21,1433,4.665338645418327
2205666,5,B0007989HU,"There are two great Dora adventures included on this video.  In the first adventure, Dora and her friend Boots find out that Dora is going to be a big sister.  Can Dora and Boots make it to Dora's house in time for the baby (or babies) to be born?

In the second adventure, Dora must make it to the soccer stadium in time to help her cousin's team, who is 1 player short.  Can Dora and Boots get to the stadium on time?

This is a great video for young children.  My daughter is a big Dora fan, and these videos are just the right length for her to watch and not lose interest.  The stories are lots of fun and encourage interacting from the children.  Plus, they promote learning by teaching such things as counting, spelling, and learning a bit of Spanish.  Purchase this fun Dora video for your child.  They'll be sure to enjoy the adventures with Dora and Boots.",1119830400,24,866,4.290123456790123
2205667,5,B0007989HU,"My two year old grand-daughter knew she was going to become a ""Big Sister"" but this Dora DVD really helped her better understand what the news really meant.  Per usual, the story was great, good pace, excellent graphics and easy to understand.  After watching the video, Emma eagerly anticipated the arrival of little sister Erin even more.  We now watch the video at every visit to Grandma's house even though Erin is now 5 months old.  We can't wait for a DVD to come out about Dora's new dog!!  Hurry up!!!",1117065600,7,509,4.549450549450549
2205668,5,B0007989HU,"My daughter can not get enough Dora. Now she goes into her ""Super Baby"" stance at the mention of Doras ""baby"" relatives. I will not give away anything else about the story line.

All I can add, is that if your child loves Dora, buy this DVD!! We all have grown fond of Boots, and even Swiper the fox around our house!",1115683200,2,317,4.112903225806452
2205669,4,B0007989HU,"We bought this for our three year old right before we had our second baby.  She is a HUGE Dora fan anyway, so this was obviously a hit in our house.  It is a fun episode!  My only complaint is that one of the bonus episodes on this DVD is ""A Letter for Swiper"" which is also a bonus episode on the Cowgirl Dora DVD, the only other one we own!",1114646400,6,342,3.788732394366197
