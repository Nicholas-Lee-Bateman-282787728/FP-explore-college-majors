8372586,3,B002LFJXLE,"Its exactly what it says: fan camera footage.  I thought there might some narration, or some kind of order to the clips, but it's just a lot of footage.  Kinda like watching an on-scene new reporter that's stalking someone.",1466640000,,223,4.6923076923076925

8372588,5,B002LFJXLE,I loved watching this dvd seeing Michael upclose from a fan's camera. I especially loved the end of it when Michael is in New york with Al Sharpton speaking about racism in the music business. It was wonderful seeing and hearing Michael speak his mind.

8372589,5,B002LFJXLE,"I was so excited to see that fan footage was available on Amazon.  I was not disappointed with this DVD.  It was all that I expected it to be but it left me longing for more.  I know there are millions of hours of this type of thing out there and I want more!  I even found myself on this footage from 1997 so I was really excited seeing myself and reliving the moment.  If you are an MJ fan/follower, this is definitely something to have.",1262649600,3,439,4.058139534883721
8372590,3,B002LFJXLE,"Going on a website like Veoh or YouTube, one can find many great little candid camera captures of Michael. I have seen many personal moments with fans captured that have made me cry and laugh and wish it could have been me. There was none of this on the DVD. Some of the footage on the DVD was worth seeing but overall I was very disappointed. There is so much footage out there, touching moments, quick clips, that I think the DVD has too much of the same thing. It's mostly ten minute clips of him standing overhead of a large crowd and waving down at them. Don't get me wrong, I love that stuff, but it was overkill of the same type of footage with no action and no real touching fan moments like the ones I've seen on the net. For example on youtube I've seen great clips like fans outside the staples center listening through the crack of the door when he was rehearsing for this is it. It was an awesome moment and the fans were so excited everytime they heard him say, ""Hee, hee"" through the door. Moments where he stopped his car on the way to his trial to accept a painting from a fan and told him he was a wonderful artist and he was going to hang it in Neverland. One where a girl meets him at the zoo and cries her eyes out and can't even stand and he hugs her and comforts her telling her it's ok, then signs an autograph for her. There are so many things like that they could have included in the DVD and failed to. I think it could have been so much better than it was. Still worth having if you're a collector, but I'd buy other DVD's first and save this one for last. I want to see moments that get to my emotions, like all the clips I see on the net. I will say the only reason I particulary liked it at all was because of the simple fact it was about Michael and had him in it.",1259798400,13,1796,4.033613445378151
8372591,5,B002LFJXLE,"this came as part of my mega-box set i received the other day!

i can hardly fathom all the crowds that followed mj everywhere he went - that must have been so exhilarating, yet tiring at times for him to hear squeals and shouts everywhere he went - even just on ordinary errands like shopping. the scene when he was in the hotel, there were lots of screaming fans below his room - wow, you can tell that mj was really loved.

one of my favorite parts was when fans were watching him shopping and they kept saying, ""i love you michael,"" and he turned and faced them and said, ""i love you too."" he looked right at them as he said it, turning around. it was quite cool - he was so loving and patient with adoring fans.

some footage on here is definitely shaky, but i agree with another reviewer who said that it may just be because the fan was filming michael jackson - how thrilling would that be?! i personally love the homemade look!

i loved getting a view of mj outside of concerts and the music films he did - although of course they are fabulous - it was cool to see him shopping and doing other things.

i recommend this - but i'm glad i got it in the mega-box set and not as a single because it was cheaper that way.",1259020800,16,1224,4.126050420168068
