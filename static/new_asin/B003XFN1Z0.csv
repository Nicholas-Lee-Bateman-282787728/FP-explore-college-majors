4216423,5,B003XFN1Z0,"To the other person who complained that this was filmed with no tripod, I think you have missed the whole entire point. I think the Directing is great. It started out with the look and feel of a low budget B-grade movie, but as the story unfolds it truly grabs you.

I think the DVD cover design does a dis-service to the movie. The covers make you think that it's an action or war movie, and people wanting a pure blow/shoot them up kind of action would be disappointed, especially in the beginning. Then you realize what this movie is really about... If you have the patience to sit thru the beginning of the movie, you'll be rewarded, in my humble opinion.

It is a great effort to bring awareness to the subject at hand.",1310256000,3,724,4.355555555555555
4216424,4,B003XFN1Z0,"Someone else has said you will not enjoy this film, and I entirely concur, however that is not a reason to avoid it. It is harrowing, but arguably a vital piece of cinema by virtue of the subject it is trying to bring to the Worlds attention, that is a civil war which has already cost 400,000 lives.

The plot is quite basic in that a team of six journalists on a fact finding mission convince their African Union (AU) minders to let them visit a remote village in Janjaweed held territory. There they meet the villagers who tell them of the brutal realities of living in a country torn apart by conflict.

They interview quite a few of the villagers and we get a glimpse into their lives and history as they tell real human stories that are easily relatable. One reporter comments that they seem almost proud of their historical inert tribal warfare.

As they are leaving they spot a Janjaweed group racing toward the village, they feel if they return the threat of International journalists might convince the Janjaweed to move on and leave the village unharmed. Then they are faced with the reality of the brutal nature of these people who tell them to leave or they will be considered villagers.

The Captain of the AU convinces them to make a hurried exit. However, the realization of what they are ignoring makes two of them return. The true horror of what the villagers had been telling them then unfolds.

This is a gripping, brutal, explicitly violent (both physical and sexual) and harrowing film. It does not even pretend to pull its punches and has a clear message in that if we allow genocide to continue then we have not learnt from history. All of the actors are first rate (you really feel the children are mortified with fear) and the unsteady camera work gives it that urgency that one often gets from documentary.

The Janjaweed storm around on horses and with four wheel drive flat bed trucks, a sort of marriage of the ancient and modern and as such sign posts the dichotomy that is modern Africa. They even try to explain the motivation of the Janjaweed in their callous hatred, but this film does not attempt to be balanced it is blatantly anti Janjaweed and does not attempt to deal with the question of where the causes of this conflict are except in pure racist terms, hence I have reposted this review and given 4 starts as to the previous 5 after a second viewing with friends.

That said, whilst not for the faint hearted this film is a real must see.",1306627200,2,2481,4.5369127516778525
4216425,5,B003XFN1Z0,"Genocide, a word coined by Raphael Lemkin, who as he studied unspeakable human behavior of the past couldn't avoid even greater atrocities happening in his own backyard in his own present, couldn't avoid yet greater atrocities in his future either.

In the Twenty-First century, never-mind the last or the last millennium, in this new and so-called modern century, humanists, socialists, and genocide-academicians alike could do NOTHING themselves but observe, ""Look, it's happening again.""

Could billions and billions of people of the world be found guilty for not avoiding the genocide in Darfur?

In their defense, in defense of billions of people not doing anything, genocide, when its causes have reached that critical point of starting it, cannot be stopped.

Real crime is the pregenocide.",1304121600,3,797,5.403225806451613
4216426,4,B003XFN1Z0,"This film's storage case depicts what appears to be a typical ""shoot-em-up"" mindless action film. Don't let that fool you. While it is fairly graphic and there is a bit of gun play...althought not by actor Billy Zane, the film is clearly intended to educate the audience on the ethnic violence in yet another failed African state. The character of the Janjaweed Militia leader is especially effective at quietly detailing the reasons for the conflict and the AU military escort officer the hopelessness of being a peacekeeper with few resources and a limited mandate. I highly recommend it.",1297036800,11,590,5.030612244897959
4216427,5,B003XFN1Z0,"I write this review within the parameters of the facts that I know this director has a history of mega-violent pictures, and that I have never seen any of them except this one. I also have never seen ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Sometimes in April,"" which are two movies similar to this one in that they both cover real-life African genocide. I did see, however, another very violent movie about African genocide called ""Tears From The Sun.""

That being said, within the limitations of my movie-viewing experiences, I must say, without exaggeration, that this is simply the most savagely violent movie I have ever seen!!!

The backdrop of the movie is a group of western journalists who visit a Darfurian village and interview residents about past attacks by the government-backed militia called the Janjaweed. However, as they are leaving, the Janjaweed return. That is the first half of the movie.

The second half of this movie, where the Janjaweed attack the village, and the powerlessness of the journalists to stop it, is where the worst savagery I've ever seen on film happens.

This is not a mindless action movie to ""just sit back, put your feet up and kill time with.""

A number of the actors in this movie are real-life Darfurian survivors, and much of the dialogue in this movie is unscripted.

Although the village in question and all of the characters are fictional, the movie itself accurately reflects the real-life genocide and the tactics used by the the Janjaweed to implement it.

As horrifying as this film is, I must say it is a very well-done film. The use of violence in a movie is not gratuitous or improper when it serves a good story, and, in the case of this movie, accurately depicts real events for the world to see and react to. But - I caution you - no film with gratuitous violence that I have ever seen in my life has ever had violence quite like this.

It is unfortunate that this movie did not get wide distribution in the USA (there's no way this movie could have been rated anything but NC-17 in the USA), because it could have informed millions more about this tragedy. Then again, it is far more unfortunate that such a holocaust took place in order to necessitate the making of this movie.",1292716800,15,2220,4.645408163265306
4216428,5,B003XFN1Z0,"I did my Term Paper last year on Darfur and I felt obligated to watch this movie. I bought and watched it and was very surprised: the movie is extremely, if not entirely accurate. The American media actors serve as a gateway to get the actual refuges to tell their story in a fluid manner, without getting the viewer detached from the movie. The movie takes a while to start, but once it does you might find yourself wanting it to stop. Remember though, it hasn't stopped in reality.
The movie is brutal. The movie is genocide at its fullest. The few that go back to fight the Janjaweed serve as the American conscious: we want to kill the Janjaweed and save the people. The movie is more of a docudrama than anything in that it merely depicts a vicious attack of a town in Darfur, with some side notes about the AU's involvement and Al Bashir's involvement. Keep in mind that their are several rapes and several infanticides, but that is the state of things I am afraid.
Good job Uwe Boll at telling the viewers what is going on in the world. Hopefully some will find the message and try to do something to help.",1291680000,26,1113,4.381642512077295
4216429,4,B003XFN1Z0,"Uwe Boll is an odd man.  He goes from utterly abysmal video game adaptation fodder (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark) to socially conscious shockers (Stoic, Rampage) in the blink of an eye.  Attack on Darfur, also known as simply Darfur (who knows why it was re-titled, or why the DVD cover makes it look like a lame action/thriller) follows a group of western journalists (among them Billy Zane, Kristanna Loken, Edward Furlong, David O'Hara, and Matt Frewer) on location in Darfur to document the atrocities and genocide taking place.  After witnessing it first hand, some decide to go back in an effort to help, and some don't.  Attack on Darfur is an uncompromising and unapologetic portrait of true horror, and it pulls no punches.  It is slow moving in the beginning and the camerawork is quite shaky, but the end result is something that surprisingly ends up staying with you after the end credits roll.  That statement in itself for a film directed by Uwe Boll should be a crowning achievement alone for the much maligned director.",1290470400,4,1043,4.766666666666667
4216430,5,B003XFN1Z0,"Yes, Uwe Boll directed it. Yes, the cover makes it look like some cheap action-thriller. And yes, the camera shakes a lot. But it doesn't matter. This is a great, powerful film, and it needs to be seen. Don't judge it by the names or its cover - judge it by the message and the content, and this is a Grade-A film that needs to be viewed and shared.",1289260800,6,349,4.072463768115942
4216431,3,B003XFN1Z0,"I feel guilty giving any movie which attempts to show the world a major genocide less than 5 stars. The movie is about a group of generic western journalists wanting to report on the genocide in Darfur. From what I gathered from the movie, the genocide is a race war consisting of Arabs Muslims killing black Muslims. The Arab Muslims known as the Janjaweed blame the West for the genocide because they (the West) want to give rights to black people.

The journalists go into a village and interview the villagers so we get to know them. Then after they leave they espy the Janjaweed headed toward the village. Some of the reporters decide they need to go back and ""help."" In order to show realism, or due to budget concerns, the camera shots all appear to be hand held. While the motion isn't as jerky as amateur filming, I found it noticeably annoying. Whatever political statement the movie was trying to make was lost to the amateur film making.

While there were moments when you feel the intensity and rage, I found them to be short lived, partly because of the western journalist simply drank themselves into a stupor after the village attack, a scene shown at the beginning of the movie.

 Oh those poor people, pass me another bottle of Jack.",1288915200,5,1251,4.596412556053812
4216432,5,B003XFN1Z0,"This is an amazing movie! When I saw the movie ""Nuba, Pure People"" at the Telluride Film Festival in 2001 I spent the next two years helping the cause here in the US to stop the genocide to these amazingly beautiful and spiritual people of Sudan!  The Government under President Bashir was killing the Nuba people long before they were killing the people of Darfur! Everyone must see this movie and get off there couches and do something to help bring peace to our world!  If your life is depressing this movie should cure you! If not then your depression is because you are too self centered and self consumed! This movie stirred every emotion in me as a human being and I highly recommend it but be prepared that it is very very sad.  It is shot in a way that it almost seems at times like a documentary but then the emotions pull you into it like a good movie does! It is unfortunate that all this is very real! I could go on with how I see our country as the source of the problem here but if you listen carefully you will hear that resonate in the words of the Janjaweed and their anger!

This story portrays a group of international reporters visiting a local village that, shortly after they leave, comes under attack from a group of rebels whose sole purpose is genocide and the expulsion of these people from their ""land"". I don't know if I'm just becoming more reflective in my waning years but I am at a loss to understand just how brutal and vicious some people can be. Some would say that they act like animals but that is an insult to animals. Only people act like this.

4216637,1,B003XFN1Z0,"This movie seems overrated.  The camera work, editing, and acting are questionable.  This is unfortunate because, Attack On Darfur has interesting subject matter.  It seems it could have been improved if done as a documentary, with a steady camera, and no close ups.  However;  the producer decided to do something different - a purposely chaotic movie with extremely jerky camera work, panning in beyond all reason.  This was clearly done for effect, with hyper scene changes, jerky images, and faces habitually enlarged so less than half the face can fit the screen.  Also;  who is killing who?  Why?  Is it religious, territorial, tribal...is it totally random?  About the only thing the viewer knows for sure about Darfur is exactly how many hair follicles each actor has.  40% five stars?  Are there really that many masochists out there?  Maybe everyone should give it a few minutes, as maybe there is something to learn, but surely there will be others who find this is murder to watch.",1464307200,,993,4.9393939393939394

This was not a action flick, this was a movie made to portray real life events as closely to the real events as it happened.  The brutality is scarring and you find yourself reflecting on it for a bit after you watch it. It is mind boggling that this type of treatment of human beings is still allowed to continue. Part of me wishes I had not watched it it, the other half of me wishes I could go over and fight with the blacks.

4216691,4,B003XFN1Z0,"...Courage is NOT blind, maniacal bravery. That's suicidal, not courage. Courage is when you know, without a doubt, that what you are preparing to do is not only dangerous, but can and probably will prove fatal. And with great fear in your heart, you still do what must be done, THAT is courage. When one decides to stand and face certain doom, even though you had all the chance in the world to escape, you could have run away, you could have turned your back and left, but instead you stand, THAT is courage. This is not your family or country or your problem that your laying your life down for, instead, it's a decision to face death because it's the RIGHT thing to do. This movie is a testament of the atrocities that are going on all over the world right now. Our own sons and daughters, wives, husbands, brothers that are out there to protect us, THEY know or have witnessed what courage is. In this particular case, a small part of Nigeria. Two different people's. Both have the same beliefs. They have shared the same desert for generations. But here, in Darfur, the simple misfortune of being a diffrent color is grounds for genocide. One group is poor, but just wants to live peacefully. One group is rich and powerful and feels that these inferior people soil their sacred religion by claiming it as their own too. This is a very volatile subject. Very disturbing. Maybe someday, human kind will put away violence and hate. But it is not this day. I was really moved by Mr. Zane's performance. Normally Zane is typecast as the villain (he's a BIG scary guy) but I feel like he smashed that mold to pieces in this film. All of the actors did a great job of making the viewer see what real Hell looks like. I gave it four stars because Attack on Darfur is shocking. Horrible.

They have no humanity and there is no reason for the existence of these evil Janjaweed people.  There are heroes in the film and they try their best.  As they confront the evil doers and try to talk to them there is no getting through to them.  For the life of me I can't understand why people would want to murder a harmless little village of people.  Apparently in this case it is Arabs who hate them for being black, even though they too are Muslims.  It is just like Hitler who wanted to eradicate the Jews, Gypsies and others they considered second class or even less than.  The bizarre thing about it is that the murderers are the lowlifes who should not be here, not the people being murdered.  This is emotional to me.

4216855,5,B003XFN1Z0,"This movie is extremely harrowing, gruesome and blood boiling. You won't enjoy it but you HAVE to see it.
The genocide by the Bashir regime in Sudan and the Janjaweed mass murderers has been swept under the carpet for too long.
Movies like this, depict events as they really happened-this movie does not exaggerate The atrocities it depicts  really took place across Darfur and resulted in the genocide of 300 000 Black Africans and the displacement of 1 500 000 more.
The rapes, the murders, the mutilations, the torture, the burnings are all taken from real eyewitness accounts.
A group of Western journalists are faced with the dilemma of whether to leave Sudan and report on what they have witnesed, or to retunr to the village in Darfur they have visited to try to stop the massacre of its people by the Janjaweed.
The murder of the villages entire population is not for the faint hearted. It may scar you but you need to see it because these events really did happen
Women were raped, children burned alive, people mutilated while still alive, all this took place.
similar to Holocaust movies which reflect the horrors carried out by the Nazis, this movie cannot be ignored.
It poses many questions.
Why has the world ignored this genocide and allowed it to take place, focusing only on fashionable politically correct causes like the Palestinians?
What leads to such inhumanity by humans to other humans. Why has Bashir not been brougth to justice and is protected by among others the South African government , Iran and the international left? how should one caught up such a situation as these Western journalists react. How would you react if you were them?
The acting is so superb you think it was real footage, the pain of the man interviewed earlier by the journalists, when he finds his entire family massacred , the fear of the women and children. This is realism at its best
Vital to draw attention to something taking place still today that has been ignored by the media, UN and 'human rights NGOs'",1434931200,4,2015,4.7407407407407405

This German director has dared do what no American would: denounce the Arabs for their savage genocide of hundreds of thousands of black men, women, children, babies, who've they've tortured, raped, hacked and shot to death in the name of Allah while the UN stands helpless as usual and the whole world cares not as the Arab leader says in the film: ""No one cares about you black slaves, monkeys"".

The film is being sold as an action film which it is not, but rather a gritty gripping powerful social document by a talented filmmaker who has you riveted to your seat in numb horror.

I highly recommend this film. I've now seen three films by Uwe Boll and I'm impressed.",1383696000,,784,4.553191489361702

4216864,5,B003XFN1Z0,"Uwe boll has taken on the task of attempting to show the world just how horrifying the genocide in Darfur truly is and he has done an admirable job in doing so. What this film depicts, how ever harsh and brutal it may be, is very much the truth. I have been an activist and involved in the Dardur conflict for awhile now and I can attest that much of that material presented in this film is far from fiction, it is reality has been happening for more than 7 years. The film presents a harsh and genuine depiction, and the work Boll has done while not perfect truly does tell an honest story about what happens in darfur every day. The Janjaweed rebels are even far more ruthless than this film really conveys. Its harsh and horrifying reality but sadly it is the truth. In this film two brave american journalists choose to give their lives in the name of what is the right thing to do in an attempt to save a small village of Sudanese blacks from being burned, mutliated and raped, and they gave their lives bravely in the process. Though there are minor weaknesses to this movie it really does tell the facts like they really are. And sad is it is to say, this movie is far easier to experience than what the reality of it is. Boll has certainly done his homework here because this movie is very accurate and realistic. Human beings are bombed, burned, dismembered and raped just like this every day in Darfur. I geuss the heroic attempts by these brave journalists is Bolls way of asking the question of what would happened if not just a few of us but perhaps thousands could do if we cared enough to give our lives to save the people of Darfur. The genocide in Darfur is truly the most serious issue in the world right now. And God bless Boll for having the love and compassion to tell the story as it really is with honestly and integrity.",1367625600,,1844,4.332369942196531

This film takes the Darfur anti-human, genocidal barbarism and shoves it in your face. There are moments when it literally took my breath away. Some may say this movie isn't for the weak and sensitive. I say this film is for everybody with a soul and a conscious. It's for everyone who believes wrongly that goodness lies in the hearts of all men. It's for anybody who's heard the name ""Darfur"", yet has no real understanding of the evil that prevails there.

Under the guise of saving Africans, the Save Darfur Coalition operation is doing a serious disservice to Africas peace and stability. The powerful and well-funded groups business is to sucker Americans into supporting an invasion and occupation of Africas largest county. By attracting sympathetic celebrities, such as Don Cheadle, and Members of the Congressional Black Caucus to voice demands for an American intervention in Darfur, Save Darfur moves a step closer to the military intervention to save Darfurs peopleand at the same timeits rich oil reserves.

Save Darfur is Christian Conservative and Neo-liberal groups in an imperialistic alliance to do in Africa what has been done in Iraq. The Save Darfur Coalition claims it is dedicated to ending genocide in Darfur.

Under the lofty ideals of democracy and humanitarianism, Save Darfur uses these as pre-texts for U.S. and European imperialist intervention there. The Save Darfur lobby has cowed the U.S. Congress and Bush administration by portraying the conflict as a kind of racial genocide. Their deceptive propaganda portrays pro-government Arab militias as terrorizing unarmed Black civilians; and has caused many concerned Americans to buy into the farce. The Save Darfur Coalition spent $15 million in 2006 and none of that money went to aid groups on the ground in Darfur.

Gullible American officials are in on the scam. But, anyone attuned to the humanitarian consequences of our imperialist interventions that are causing the occupation of Iraq, funding Israeli repression of Palestinians and backing reactionary terror around the world should take a moment of reflection. How did traditionally racist white politicians become champions for the lives of Africans?

Unfortunately, the Save Darfur propaganda has taken hold among some well-intentioned activists and progressive organizations. The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has encouraged that UN-mandated European and Western peacekeepers be placed in Darfur. CBC members claim that putting the weight of the U.S. government behind the insurgent forces in Darfur shows U.S. commitment to the lives of African people.

Those calling for imperialist intervention do not talk about the U.S. or Frances role in promoting the conflict, or the horrendous conflicts also occurring in limited-resource countries neighboring Darfur. They do not mention profits that imperialist powers can gain from entering Sudan and breaking it apart. Instead, these progressive or human rights organizations fuel a demonization campaign to view the war as Arabs against Africans.

The main division in Darfur is economic: between migratory herders and sedentary farmers. The vast majority of all the people of Darfur are Muslims and all are Black. Recognizing and explaining the complicated economic and political issues there does not make for good propaganda; instead it is more convenient to portray the struggle as one of genocidal Arabs against defenseless Africans.

The well-connected people of Save Darfur have made gobs of money for the activist community and made millions of Americans feel good while actually doing squat to save people in Darfur. But, real people for peace reject the rhetoric. Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan labels Save Darfur actions imperialistic. Republican presidential candidate and Congressman Ron Paul criticized the coalition, calling its aims unconstitutional and claims it would be counterproductive to intervene in the war and would prolong it. Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter say that calling events in Darfur genocide is unhelpful. Former Senator, and U.S. Ambassador to the UN, John Danforth says claims of genocide are political.

African-Americans should involve themselves in ways to help and not hinder in Africa. The first step is to be about the business of getting the Darfur rebels to the peace table. Over past years, Sudans rebel factions have repeatedly walked away from peace talksencouraged by the anti-government campaign waged by the imperialist powerswhich only prolongs the fighting and expands the crisis.
