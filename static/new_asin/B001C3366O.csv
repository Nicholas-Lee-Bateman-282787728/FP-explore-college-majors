8285699,4,B001C3366O,It was a little slow starting but after about 3 or 4 episodes my wife and I were into it. It is just downright funny once you figure out where the story is heading. We have laughed our butts off. We're waiting on the second season now,1398729600,,234,4.0
8285700,5,B001C3366O,"Step away from the Sopranos. The Wests are more fun than the Corleones and grittier than those Jersey folks.  Who'd have thought New Zealand would give us one of the best crime families ever seen on the big or small screen.

When paterfamilias and career criminal Wolfgang West (Grant Bowler) gets sentenced to four years in the pokey for his last job (and has to serve 3 without possibility of parole), Mom Cheryl (Robyn Malcolm) decides it's time to take the family out of the petty crime game and go legit.  Her children by and large disagree, her attempts to find legitimate employment are just as difficult as they would be in real life, and the straight and narrow turns out to be kinda crooked in its own way.

The family is unabashed Trash.  Daughter Pascalle (Siobhan Marshall) dreams of becoming Rachel Hunter and thinks stripping in cheesy dives is a step in the right direction. There are two twin sons: Jethro is already on the straight and narrow, a fresh-from-passing-the-bar lawyer; his identical twin, Zack, is adorable but slow. Very, very slow...the possible result of being locked in a freezer when he was eight. Both twins are played by Antony Starr. Starr pulls of an incredible trick: he manages to look enough like himself to convince you he is twins, but not quite exactly like himself.  The different hair helps, but Starr masters a completely different physicality for both brothers, their facial expressions and body language are distinct and different, without being overdone.

Youngest daughter Loretta (Antonia Prebble)wants to be David Lynch/George Romero/Tim Burton when she grows up. She managed to miss a couple of years of school by blackmailing one of her teachers (and her attorney brother's long time lover). Loretta somehow manages to makes sociopathy cute and cuddly. We also have Grandpa West, a horny old devil, retired now, and spending his time cheating friends and family at friendly poker games...and despite Cheryl's retrieved family reformation, pulling the occasional heist.

Outside the family, the important players include Zack's best friend and partner in crime Munter, the only person on the planet who could make Zack look clever. Played Tammy Davis, he steals every scene he is in, which is high praise indeed because the whole ensemble is exceptional. Kirk Torrance plays Detective Wayne Judd, a cop who is very involved with the Wests in a number of interesting ways. I'm listing these cast members because they are so good in this show, they are worth tracking down and following in other films and series.

This is not your over-decorated, over-ormolued New Jersey Provincial crew in designer jeans. Cheryl Wolf is no acrylic-nailed Carmela. Her kitchen is strictly from formica, she relies on the salesgirl at Sears, not her personal stylist, for fashion advice, her eyelashes are weighed down by enough mascara to make Tammy Faye Baker blink, and animal prints are her new black. Cheryl's bosoms are hiked up to her neckline, her stomach is the stomach of a woman who's fast approaching 50 and with four kids to show for it, and we can see those little rolls of back fat..but don't think she's not sexy, because she is...very sexy in an appealing and earthy way.

Whoever does hair, make up and costumes for the show deserves an award.  They get it all right, down to the smallest details: A zipper on the back of Pascalle's bridemaid gown doesn't quite make it to the top; seams gape, bra straps slip, and the clothes look like they've been sourced from the Designer Collection at Target. Hair is working class wonderful...curled, teased and sprayed into submission.  And all the ladies wears blue or silver eyeshadow on special occasions. Sometimes blue and silver.

The casting is brilliant. Pascalle can look like your basic skank in one scene and in another, will show a purity of beauty that's dazzling.  Loretta looks innocent enough to get away with her disturbing list of offenses, Wolfgang sports a body sculpted by the Department of Corrections, and Cheryl -- with her dime store make up, strip mall beauty salon perm, and sagging body crammed into ill-fitting leopard skin frocks or tight jeans can look cheap, worn out and well used--and then a smile will light up her face, the years will fall off, and you can see why her husband and several other characters have the serious hots for her. This is not your average show where everyone looks as if they stepped out of a photo shoot for Elle.

The writing is wicked sharp, the humor delightfully dark. ""Outrageous Fortune"" joins my pantheon of Great Crime Family Shows (which includes The Straits and The Take).  If you like your humor slightly to the left of center and enjoy complex plots (and believe me, the plots, subplots, underlying story lines, evolving/devolving/revolving family relationships, adulteries, hook ups, divided loyalties, betrayals and broken promises make this a show you can watch on any number of levels), do not miss this show. I tend to be a somewhat generous reviewer and give five stars where others might have considered just four, but by any standards, this is a solid Five Star Show.

Australia is coming out with some exceptional programming. I understand an American version of Outrageous Fortune is planned, but I have a feeling once it gets dumbed down to levels our TV executives think are appropriate for U.S. viewers, it's not going to compare to the original.  Do yourself a favor and check this one out. instead. All the shows mentioned in this review are available on Hulu, Amazon/Amazon Prime and/or Netflix.",1371081600,,5578,4.934898612593383
8285701,5,B001C3366O,One of my best friends who is from New Zealand introduced me to this show.  Hopefully the US remake will force a region 1 release of the awesome kiwi original. It's my favorite kind of show...one that can make you laugh and cry. Truly one of a kind.,1249862400,,249,4.1875
8285702,5,B001C3366O,"Having lived in New Zealand for a couple years, I didn't expect much from this series. Being such a small country, home grown television tends to be done on the cheap and usually very forgettable.

But this is a brilliant drama-comedy about a criminal family trying to play it straight, and realizing that those on the right side of the law are every bit as amoral as they are.

The characters are well-developed and have their endearing flaws and quirks; the dialogue is witty (Learn a bit of Kiwi slang and Maori references for the full effect.), and the plot twists are unexpected and will leave a smile on your face. Clips from New Zealand rock bands are featured throughout the series.

It has a bit of an ""Arrested Development"" meets ""Desperate Housewives"" feel to it, but it is its own brand of drama and humour and not a copy of either show by any means.

New Zealand broadcast TV is much more risqu&eacute; than broadcast TV in the U.S., so you'll see a fair bit of unedited swearing and partial nudity. This merely adds to the silliness and absurdity of the characters and plots.

ABC is doing a remake of the show for U.S. audiences, but given broadcast standards in the U.S. it will probably be as watered down as some of the Britcom remakes. Get the original. It's worth it.

This is a Region 4 PAL-format DVD but can be watched on a PC with a DVD drive (that must be set to Region 4) or a ""region-free code-free"" DVD player (which you can get on Amazon for $40-50) like this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PHILIPS-DVP3140-ALL-REGION-CODEFREE-MULTI-SYSTEM-DVD-PLAYER-WITH-DivX-PLAYS-PAL-NTSC-DVDS-FROM-ANY-COUNTRY-ON-NTSC-TV-REMOTE-INCLUDED/dp/B000Q0NDSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PHILIPS DVP3140 - ALL REGION CODEFREE MULTI SYSTEM DVD PLAYER WITH DivX.
