8179812,5,B000NO2FTM,"Not much to say about this DVD other than it is the complete CBS broadcast of the 1982 NCAA Basketball Championship between North Carolina and Georgetown.  There are no extras, if that's what you're wondering, and there is no coverage of the pre-game, halftime, or post-game.  The game has chapter stops at the beginning, midway through the first half, halftime, and midway through the second half.  The audio and video are very good, and the commercials have been edited out.  The game itself is great, featuring players like Worthy, Jordan, Perkins, Floyd, and Ewing.",1181088000,2,569,5.0212765957446805
