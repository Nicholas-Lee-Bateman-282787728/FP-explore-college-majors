8046882,2,B0007D4MAE,"I found the show to be badly marketed, and the use of CGI instead of miniatures stole some of the watchability.  Gimme Star Trek or Firefly anyday, a good sci-fi show should mimic westerns.  I wonder if reviewers of this show enjoyed Godzilla movies...",1180396800,,252,4.704545454545454
8046883,4,B0007D4MAE,"Andromeda, back in its final season with a bang! Sure the show lost a chunk of the budget that they have had with previous seasons but that doesn't stop the writers from coming up with a nice season long story arc which delivers! Any sci-fi fan with a love of action should add this volume to their collection. Andromeda just plain ROCKS! (4 stars because we should be on collection 5 by NOW!)",1140652800,3,393,4.397260273972603
8046884,4,B0007D4MAE,"I never got the chance to watch this series during its original run on cable and my first experience of this series was on DVD and after watching this series in its entirety (through Season 4) I must say that the ending to Season 4 was much too negative for a series to end like that.

I don't plan on wasting my time picking up the Season 5 DVD's because the whole premise of Season 5 about a darker universe and being trapped within a single solar system is too absurd for a science fiction series too remain too limited to a single plot thread.

While this has been an enjoyable series I think there should have been some resolution during the last episode but it was a very nice ending to the series considering that with Season 5, the directors, producers and creative team seem to run out of story ideas much like what happened with Season 5 of Babylon 5.

All in all, Andromeda (Season 1-4) deserves one of my best recommendations, if you're looking for a new series to get into. If you're looking for an original science fiction series to watch that doesn't contrain itself to the norm (i.e., Star Trek) than I'd suggest such shows as Andromeda, Farscape, Stargate SG-1, Firefly, Roswell, Dark Angel and Babylon 5 (Season 1-4). These are highly recommendable shows and deserve a special look.",1111276800,3,1300,4.547008547008547
8046885,3,B0007D4MAE,"Again, a great set quality wise. Top video and sound as usual.

Season one is still the best in my eyes and season three following that. Season four has been mainly lacklustre and has lost much of my interest with only a few good episodes. It became plodding and unfocused for many episodes. However, the last two final episodes are pretty good, if a bit Babylon 5-eque in some ways (B5 is still he best show out there BTW). We have lots of action and feel for the characters, especially Dillon.

Spoiler warning - so don't read after this if you don't want to!

I still can't help but wonder why Trance didn't just do what she did far sooner, even seasons ago! And why does the final episode have to be so tragic? Many needless deaths I feel. I was hoping for Tier to come back after surviving his fall somehow, to create a nice three-way battle, but no. When he left is when things went slowly downhill. This looks like a definite ending to me... I wonder what this studio will be up to next.",1109894400,,994,4.304812834224599
