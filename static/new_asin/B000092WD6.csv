This takes place in 1941 Libya. Australian soldiers protected Tobruk against the German Army, which bypassed them on the way to Cairo and the Suez Canal. They were to hold their defense position for two months. The British General explains his plan: stop the infantry, allow the tanks to advance alone before they were attacked. Artillery shells explode. Machine guns and mortars repel attacking Germans. A lone enemy tank advances until it is stopped by a shell. Any decision by a line officer has consequences. They want volunteers on the front lines to stage attack raids at night. On July 9, 1941 they attacked an ammunition dump using captured enemy trucks. Grenades neutralize enemy machine gun nests. The explosive charges are set off to destroy the enemys supplies.

But some are caught. A doctor treats the Lt. Colonels wounds. The Field Marshall says his forces are nearing Alexandria and will arrive at Cairo. The Colonel says Tobruk prevents their advance. Airplanes machine gun enemy trucks; two prisoners escape. They must travel by night to return to Tobruk. Tobruk was attacked again and again by the Germans. The best and most experienced must hold a defense position. But they are running out of ammunition and soldiers. What will this company do? The enemy shells their positions. Later the sound of bagpipes identify the relief columns approach. They held out for 242 days, much longer than two months.

Personal conflicts are used for added drama. To best appreciate this movie read a history of the war in North Africa. In January 1943 the American Army invaded in the west and advanced. The German Army retreated. The Allies invaded Sicily and advanced north. Rommel could win against superior forces because he concentrated them against a diffused enemy. He had a better source of information from his spies but was limited by a lack of supplies. The appointment of Montgomery changed that.",1454371200,,2130,4.96078431372549
