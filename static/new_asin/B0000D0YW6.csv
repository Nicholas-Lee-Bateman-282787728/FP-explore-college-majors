8000261,5,B0000D0YW6,"The special effects are awful -- think early Power Rangers episodes but with more lasers.  The dubbing doesn't make sense and the subtitles seem to have been procured from an automatic translator with a bad glitch.  The description on the cover bears no discernible resemblance to what takes place in the film.  The costuming reminds me of a junior high theatre performance.  The DVD appears to have been recorded off a damaged VHS tape.  I don't understand why the vampires can't walk but instead have to hop with their arms held out in front of them -- but also they can fly, yet they still choose to hop about awkwardly.  Nothing about this movie makes sense, which explains why it is my favorite kung fu flick of all time ever and I was thrilled to find it offered on Amazon.",1437955200,,779,4.5285714285714285
