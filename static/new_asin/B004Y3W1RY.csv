This is the driving story line behind the scenes of this movie. Jean gives a brilliant performance as a talented writer who, like so many, have lost their talent (and everything else they held close) to the bottom of a bottle. And Albert is uproarious as his disease (cancer in this case) that has come to visit OUTSIDE the body.

It shows how your priorities can change when you know time is limited & you see what has been right under your nose... all too visible had it not been buried in a glass. Love is found again, ties renewed & cancer frightened away... yes, I said frightened away... it's one of the most comedic scenes in this drama.

You will laugh and also think... everybody leaves here sometime... the question is: will you go happy or full of regrets of what might have been?",1369958400,,862,4.375
