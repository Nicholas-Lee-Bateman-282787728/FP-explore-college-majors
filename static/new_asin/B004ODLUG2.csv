8437122,2,B004ODLUG2,"This ditty was extremely enjoyable.  The plot was well played out and the acting was great.  However, why the creators of this film added this zany, drunken singer as the Ferguson's next-door-neighbor I'll never know.  He was disgusting and added nothing to the thread of this film.  He must have been a friend or financier to someone on this project.  I took away three points for this fatal mistake.",1384560000,3,401,4.753623188405797
