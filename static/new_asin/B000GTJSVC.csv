2618163,5,B000GTJSVC,"This video has 6 sections: legs, chest, back, shoulders, triceps, and biceps. Each section is 2 or 3 (for legs it is 4!) exercises that last 5 about minutes each which really wear each muscle down until you can barely lift any weight at all. By the time you are done working out a body part, you are really glad to be moving on. I consider that a good thing in an exercise video, because it pushes me harder than I would push myself.

There isn't really any cardio, though. However, if I want cardio I can do the Get Ripped 1000 workout. This one is great for all around strength and endurace.",1198540800,27,593,4.247787610619469
2618164,3,B000GTJSVC,"This is a good workout and I love Jari too but I prefer all of Jari's other workouts over this one.  I guess supersetting is just not for me. Also, in the lunge section near the beginning you hold your feet in the same place for a long time (in a lunge position).  I found this really irritated my ankle and foot while holding in back in that position for so long.  I have only done this video once and it will probably be a long time before I pull it out again (when I forget how much I did not care for it).  It is really HARD though.  Personally, I would highly recommend Get Ripped to the Core or even the original Get Ripped.  Those 2 are my faves..",1198195200,23,654,3.9923076923076923
2618165,5,B000GTJSVC,"I own all of Jari's video--and recommend them--but this one is my favorite!  This workout really focuses on the upper body (by the end my arms feel like spaghetti noodles), but there is enough lower body work to get your legs burning as well.  Both Jari (in her 40s) & Gaylene (in her 50s) will motivate you to stick with it...I am seeing increased definition after 3 weeks.",1197590400,4,374,4.485294117647059
2618166,5,B000GTJSVC,"All of Jari's workouts are great. In this one she adds more variety of exercises for each body part. I love this workout. It's fun, and it's very effective. Her sequencing and her style are great.",1197590400,14,196,4.472222222222222
2618167,5,B000GTJSVC,"Excellent, just like the first 3 DVDs I bought.
Makes you work harder than doing it on your own and even when you don't feel like working out, you don't want to let Jari down and then you really enjoy it.",1197504000,4,204,4.0
2618168,5,B000GTJSVC,"Jari is a fantastic instructor.  She may not be as vibrant and outgoing as a Christi Taylor or a Kari Anderson, but she is straight to business, get results instructor.  She could whip ANYONE into shape.
This is another brilliant workout.  I have all her other workouts and this is up there with them.  You really fatigue your muscles here.  Free weights and high repetition to get the maximum burn.  If you are going through a plateau or such, then this will push you beyond it.  It's really helpful to get your metabolism up because there is so much intensity for your muscles.  The first time I did this, I could barely move the next day and in fact I still felt the effects of this for almost half a week.  All you need is weights, maybe a dumbell if you want and you can use a step as your weight bench.
I thoroughly enjoyed this workout (yes, even through the fatigue and pain) because I know it's going to tone up almost any trouble spot and also because she is a good clear instructor who cues well.  I would only suggest doing this three times a week maximum, but as always, consistensy is key and do this with cardio.  I love it.",1196380800,33,1139,4.300469483568075
2618169,5,B000GTJSVC,"I LOVE Jari Love!  She seems so sincere.  My first (and favorite workout) of hers is Get Ripped 1000 'cause it has cardio with the muscle toning.  I recently got Slim & Lean and the new Get Chiseled.  This Chiseled one works every muscle good, but I find it really is more challenging for my upper body.  I was worked to failure on many of the upper body tracks and had to lighten my weight or stop for a few reps.  Remember the butt cramps from the original Buns of Steel with Greg Smithy?  Well, that is what this is for your arms, back, and upper body.  You will be sore!",1192752000,19,574,4.108108108108108
2618170,5,B000GTJSVC,"I'm fairly new to Jari's workouts but have really been enjoying them--I love how she pushes you to work hard yet doesn't kill you.  I was thrilled to be able to preview her newest video, Ripped & Chiseled.  I found it to be most similar to her Get Ripped Slim & Lean in that it is a long workout (just over an hour) which really challenges your endurance.  However, Ripped & Chiseled is different in that Jari uses 2-3 consecutive exercises per muscle group, so each area really gets hit hard!

Jari's background exercisers here include Gaylene from Ripped 1000 (who amazingly is 57 years old!), Judy, and Mike.  As with the other Ripped workouts, you have your choice of using different types of equipment, including dumbbells, a barbell, and weight plates.  Also, the weight loads for each exerciser are shown (this time BEFORE the exercise starts, which is great because it gives you time to set up) as well as the total number of repetitions.

Again Jari uses a high number of repetitions with varied counts (singles, 2-2, 4-4, 3-1, 1-3, and pulses), but she adds some new twists here, such as high/low pulses on the squats and 1-7/7-1 counts on the triceps work.  There are a total of 15 exercise tracks as follows:
1.  Warm-Up
2.  Lunges
3.  Squats
4.  Stiff Leg Deadlift/Bent Knee Deadlift
5.  Chest Press
6.  Push Ups
7.  Chest Fly
8.  Back Track
9.  Triceps Dips
10. Skull Crushers
11. Pull Overs
12. Overhead Press
13. Biceps
14. Hammer Curls
15. Cool Down

With the exception of the triceps dips, which is a bit shorter, each track averages around 4.5-5 minutes.  As you can see, there is no abs work, but the abs section from Slim & Lean (a nice quick abs routine consisting of 4 exercises performed in 2 sets), is included as a bonus.  The DVD Bonus features are as follows:  Abs Workout-Talking Nutrition-Healthy Recipes-Other Programs-Previews.

Although this workout is similar to Slim & Lean, I enjoyed it much more; it just seemed to flow more smoothly, making the time, although lengthy, go by more quickly.  Although not as intense overall as Ripped 1000, which includes cardio, I believe that Ripped & Chiseled is Jari's most intense endurance workout to date.  Since you are working each muscle group several times before moving on, you will probably need to use lighter weights than with Jari's other workouts--even Jari & crew dropped to lower weights during the biceps section!  Therefore, this would not be a good workout to use as part of a heavy lifting routine.

The best thing about this workout was that I felt great after I was done!  Definitely an excellent endurance workout for intermediate to advanced exercisers; highly recommended.",1190764800,180,2669,4.758169934640523

2618192,4,B000GTJSVC,"I don't have a gym membership and rely on my collection of at home DVDs to stay fit.  Jari's DVD does not disappoint. This is different from everything else In my collection (I'm a big Jillian fan) and I like that I can use this for at home weight training with dumbbells.  Seriously Jari will work you to the core. I use this DVD after doing one of my Jillian or other cardio workouts, and have yet to complete the entire workout all at once. I only use a set of 2lb weights and think it will be awhile before I make it to my set of 5lb-ers if even.  But that is the nice thing, just add more weight if it gets easy.  Jari is encouraging without being too peppy or mean.  Some people may not like it but she gives An inspirational/motivational quote at the end of every mini segment and I love that.  One complaint is that they do heavy leg work in the first half and then arms only In the second half.  I'd like if they alternated to avoid fatigue... I think I would be more consistent with my performance too.  The cool down lacked some direction.. But I liked how Jari casually was talking to her ""assistants"" who are normal people who take her class.  And yes, also in awe like others that Gaylene is 57!

Also in the background are 3 people working out with Jeri and during the cool down she says they are just people from her class - not instructors and then asks the brunette how old she is and she says 57!

2618203,3,B000GTJSVC,"I bought Ripped last year, around the same time I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-No-More-Trouble-Zones/dp/B001NFNFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones</a>, but only pulled it out to try it last night.  I've been doing the Jillian Michaels DVD for the last month and wanted to try this one to possibly target my muscles in a different way. The video DEFINITELY targets your muscles in a profound way, but the main reason I only gave it 3 stars is that, out of all 15 circuits, there is NO abs workout!

Jari does sheepishly mention about 4/5ths of the way through the video that ""we've been working our abs the whole time"" (indirectly, I guess), but that sounded to me like a pretty lame excuse for not delivering on one of the MOST ESSENTIAL elements of any circuit training workout.  Anyway, the video starts with a pretty decent warm-up and ends with a cool down that is rather inadequate given the level of intensity of the exercises.  The work out is very heavy on the upper body (arms) and by comparison only minimally targets the lower body (glutes, quads, and hammies).  In order to get some balance, I had to basically substitute some of the ab and glute exercises I learned from Jillian Michaels' DVD during the last 4 segments (rather than keep hammering away at my poor arms!).

Also, the women in this video, including Jari, look truly frightening!  I think they might be body builders or something by trade.  But it also looks like they've had a LOT of plastic surgery done (I mean, natural human skin just ain't that tight and shiny...especially not at their age!).  I spent the first half of the workout preoccupied with the fear that I might actually end up LOOKING like these women, which was kinda distracting.  The music was also annoying, though not overly intrusive. Jari tries to be encouraging throughout the workout, but clearly isn't a natural at this, so instead she just keeps reminding us over and over again that the buildup of lactic acid in our muscles will break us out of our plateau.

I would recommend this video for folks who want to spend an hour targeting their arms and don't mind a shallow, phony LA vibe.  For those who want a more balanced workout that is equally (or more) challenging, try Jillian Michaels or someone else. Good luck!",1283644800,3,2378,4.947236180904523

I have Ripped, Ripped to the Core, Ripped 1000, and Ripped Slim & Lean.  Ripped & Chiseled is my favorite one.  It is more challenging than the others, with more reps and, it feels like, more different exercises.  I do this one when I really want to get a hard workout in.",1282694400,,469,3.905263157894737

2618206,5,B000GTJSVC,"This is a strength training workout that I do once a week.  This is a pretty challenging workout, but I normally do it on my lazy days since there isn't much cardio to it.

2618207,5,B000GTJSVC,"Ok, here are a few recconmendations if you are contemplating buying this... first off, you will need a set of dumbbells in your weight range (I personally use anything from 2-10lbs, hoping to increase and need heavier weight soon), a step, a mat, and just about a 6"" by 6"" area to move I would say.  Great if you live in small quarters.  I know I do.  It will help if you are familiar with her exercises, but it is not necessary... you can learn as you go.  I would say beginners to advanced can use this because of the built in modifications and the ability for you to vary your weights.  Also, it would be best if you are not already sore before doing this!  It's pretty tough if you truly challenge yourself.

You will see a good bit of repeat exercises from previous DVDs, it's true, but there was enough variety to keep me interested and going.  Skull crushers for instance I had never done before, and now love them because they certainly make you feel the burn in the triceps (a trouble spot for me).  I wish there had been a little bit more lower body work, but that was ok with me... I think she hits you hard enough with the squats and lunges in the beginning to make up for it.  Jari has a very good personality to me in this one... she just seems to have hit that right balance of being friendly, motivating and just a little chatty at times.  She is very relaxed in this one even though the workout is hard and that helps me keep my cool.  During the stretching segment she chats a lot with Gaylene and Mike.  I liked hearing other people's takes on Jari's workouts.  I was amazed and impressed to hear that Gaylene (who is also featured in Ripped 1000) is 57 and does not too carefully watch what she eats.  That made it seem more real to me that I can actually have Ripped results without totally giving up every yummy food I love!  No seriously, I do watch what I eat, but unlike Jari, I do have a treat once or twice a week such as ice cream or a small bowl of chips.  I doubt Jari has seen these foods since childhood.  Anyway, the stretching segment does get gyped a little because of this... you may just want to do your own stretching while you listen.

There is no Abs workout on this, except for the Bonus Feature which is the Abs workout from Slim and Lean... which by the way is only about 5 minutes and is not the best, but it's ok if you want a quick fix for your abs.  I personally always do extra ab workouts after doing her DVDs... that's where all my fat seems to settle.

Other bonus features include some nutritional informationa about portion sizes and some tips on what to eat, when to eat etc.  GREAT INFO!  Make sure you check this out.  Also, some delicous and healthy recipes included.  Get out some pen and paper to copy those down.

One little gripe I had about this video was her selection of ""Judy"" to participate.  Judy hardly smiled and had a mean look on her face most of the time, but more than that, her form was sloppy in some exercises.  During the bicep track, I found myself yelling at her.  She was definetely swinging the barbell up using momentum and then smooshing herself in the boobs with it, releasing the contraction on the bicep. A good bicep curl requires that you control the movements up and down and you don't come up quite all the way... I know that's tough on 120 reps, but maybe she should have had lighter weight then!  It was just dissapointing because I have enjoyed seeing all the other Rippers and found them motivating.  Gaylene was great and knowing her age makes it even more admirable!

Bottom line... great strength training here... small annoyances throughout should not impede you.  Seriously, Jari has a good thing going.  If you're questioning her methods or not sure if you wanna buy this or hang with her workouts, Please do so for at least a few weeks.  Believe me, when I first tried Slim and Lean a long time ago, I didn't like it, but I stuck with it... and for the first time in my life I have muscle definition instead of that soft pudgy look.

This is what I needed to kick start my exercising again.

I did go out and buy myself the original exercise step, about $80, because this is what they use on the DVD when they are doing the weight lifting portion.

Work up to doing the entire program over a period of two to three weeks and you'll feel good and be pleasantly surprised with the results.  Even though it's impossible to use really heavy weights due to the high number of repetitions, remember that this is REAL weightlifting with the intensity coming for the high number of reps and that it's important to follow the weightlifting principle that says to NOT exercise the same body part two-days in a row with weights.  Even though the weights are fairly light, this is serious exercise and it's urgent to allow your muscles a day of recovery after each workout.

2618235,5,B000GTJSVC,"Get ripped & chiseled is an excellent pure weight training.

The warm up starts already with squats, biceps curls and all that stuff with light weights. No aerobic moves, no big inhales or shoulder rolls, just a simple start with weights, but all moves just the half way.

After the warm up, you start working your legs and glutes with squats and lunges, your back with deadlifts, pullovers and rows, your chest with chest presses, flies and push-ups, your triceps with dips and skull crushers, your shoulders with overhaed presses and a combination of front and side lifts and your biceps with biceps curls and hammer curls.
All routines change the movements from 4 and 4 counts to 3 and 1, 2 and 2 and single counts. So for me it is never boring and I have the impression that my muscles can better keep at the workout.
After every single unit (you can chose to do the whole workout (60 minutes) or pick some special exercises), there is a small stretch for the muscles, which is a very good thing.

Finally, there is the cool down, where you get some informations about the participants of the workout, but you have to watch closely, what everybody is doing.

As a special feature between nutrition information and publicity for other workouts you find an ab workout (10 minutes) from an older DVD.

All in all, this is a good one for me and my boyfriend with no aerobic moves.

This workout, though deemed strength training, can also be used as cardio assuming you put enough into it. I find that when I truly challenge myself and really put my heart into this workout that it gets my pulse up and keeps it up through a majority of the DVD. That said, this workout is definitely very challenging and by the end of each track I find that each muscle group being worked is trembling. Jari has a great personality and really does well to encourage without being annoying. I like the way she explains and teaches throughout the DVD.

Jari shows you modified moves for the beginner and more difficult moves for the advanced fitness buff. I am most certainly the former, as I did my pushups against the wall and used 3 pound weights (they use 10-16 pound weights! HOW??).  In fact, during the shoulder track, I had to drop to 2 pound weights...then one pound weights....then just the weight of my arms. Oh, the burn.
And they are jelly today.  My legs are useless. :)  But not for long!!  This DVD is sure to bring good results with dedicated use, 2-3 times a week.  And I am pleased that I will be able to use it as I get stronger---just by increasing the weight.
The only thing that bugged me about this DVD (and I am still giving it 5 stars, as I feel the DVD review should be about the *workout*) is the bonus nutrition segment.  The interaction between Jari and her ditzy nutrionist is super annoying.  I could not watch the whole thing as her voice was really grating and she seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera.  I am sure the information itself was important, but I would rather listen to someone like Susan Powter (who has an intense deep voice and speaks with authority and confidence) discuss nutrition.

2618251,5,B000GTJSVC,"More Jari!!!  Yay!!!  I just recently bought the ""ripped 1000"" video which i didn't have yet and also this new ""ripped & chiseled"" video.  Now my collection is complete!  woo-hoo!

There are some new moves in this one & your muscles will feel it.  i know mine sure did!  I guess after months & months of the same moves i got kind of used to the workouts. (i was rotating slim & lean & ripped to the core)  Well I just did ripped & chiseled for the 1st time 2 days ago & am still sore.  man did i feel it!  I am glad i got ripped & chiseled to add to my rotation, i am sure it's going to be a great addition.  Now i can't wait to test out ripped 1000 (which i watched part of the way through.  it has cardio mixed in with the weight training. Nice!)

I guess the ripped & chiseled is most similar to slim & lean in the type of format, being highest reps with no cardio or tough compound moves.  I noticed afterwards that i didn't sweat as much as i thought i would.  I seem to sweat profusely through ripped to the core & sweat a bit through slim & lean.  After this workout i was basically dry.  but my muscles were fatigued, especially my upper body.  i noticed more arm/chest/back exercizes, and i feel soreness mostly in the upper body.  I wanted some more arm toning so that's fine with me!  i'll just do ripped 1000 next since she mixes in cardio.

A Downfall is that there is no abs.  As others have stated, she threw in the slim & lean abs segment as an extra.  You have the option to do that after the workout is over.  I just wish it was tacked on before the stretching instead of having to play it afterwards but that is my only gripe.

Overall i really like all her videos, they are all different & it's good to have variety to mix it up.  but i must say i am a huge ripped to the core fan because of the compound moves.  They really get my heart-rate up & i feel it in my whole body going up & down off the step (you can do it without a step but it's not as effective. trying to stay balanced going up & down off the step works your abs the whole time. Actually i use a BOSU instead of step & that makes it even more challenging.) So I really hope her next video has some new compound moves in it.  :)",1203811200,6,2213,3.9569160997732427
2618252,5,B000GTJSVC,"This workout is definitely challenging enough for an advanced exerciser like myself, and it is also good for beginners. The only thing is, do not use weights or the step on the lunges because off the step they are quite challenging at first. Be sure to use your own body weight starting out, and build up from there. The first two exercises are for you lower body (lunges off the step and squats). Both tracks are very hard, so you are working hard right at the beginning. The rest of the tracks are for your upper body and back. I love the back track becuase you are really working your back muscle throughout. The last three tracks are by far the hardest, all working your upper body into ripped and chisled muscles. The shoulder presses fried my biceps and shoulders! Overall, a great workout. I was disappointed that an abs workout was missing, but the one from ""Slim and Lean"" is included in the bonus menu.",1203552000,5,912,4.5
2618253,4,B000GTJSVC,"I used Jari's ""Slim and Lean"" DVD before. ""Ripped and Chiseled"" is the second DVD I have of her. I have to say, I like the Slim and Lean DVD better. My goal is to find an exercise routine that burns calories while weight training. There is limited amount of time to exercise everyday, I wanted more bang for my effort so to speak. This particular DVD does not really keep my heart rate elevated throughout. Looking at the exercise breakdown, the exercises that incorporate lower body muscles are all in the front of the DVD. The lower body lounges and squats get my heart rate going in the beginning, but after that, there is hardly anything for the lower body at all. The upper body exercises doesn't use large enough muscles to maintain my heart rate in the 80% range.

Overall, this is a good workout video. I like the fact that the workout involves controlled movement, Jari is not overly hyper, bouncing off the walls, like some other aerobic videos. The back workout is new, and very necessary for me.

Update (2 months later):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've been using Jari's ""Ripped 1000"" and ""ripped to the core"" with ""Chiseled"". I realized that the three DVDs have slightly different focus.

- Ripped 1000's focus is mixing cardio with weight reps, your heart rate is elevated throughout because of the cardio portions. On average I consume 20 oz of water during this video and seems to sweat them all out.

- ""Ripped to the Core"" is slightly less cardio than 1000, but lots of compound exercises that involve both upper and lower body at the same time. Heart rate is elevated but not nearly as much as 1000. I can get away with drinking 15oz of water.

- ""Chiseled"" is less bouncy. More focus on each muscle group. Especially the back, arms, shoulders and chest. Because of the large amount of upper body work, my heart rate is not as high as the other two, but the upper body muscles do get more work. Because of the lower cardio, I perspire a lot less, and can get away with drinking 8oz of water.

My arms and shoulders were all sore after using ""Chiseled"" even after I've been working with ""1000"" for a few weeks. So I guess it depends on what your focus is. I had limited amount of time to work, and I wanted every minute to count. So I chose 1000 more thinking that I can work Cardio as well as weight at the same time by keeping the heart rate high. But I think ""1000"" does not do as well when it comes to train the upper body muscles as the ""Chiseled"". So my new plan is to use this video once a week.

One drawback, the break between segments in this video is extremely short, I had to pause the DVD after most of the segments. I suppose this could be viewed as a good thing, you get as much material as you can, crammed into the alloted time. Keep the remote close though.",1203465600,56,2784,4.373307543520309
2618254,5,B000GTJSVC,"Jari Love's Ripped & Chiseled workout DVD is awesome!  If you are familar with Body Pump at your gym, this is very similar.  She does lots of reps with light weights, so no need to worry about bulking up--for us ladies!  Good addition to your workout collection!",1203033600,2,262,4.531914893617022
2618255,5,B000GTJSVC,This is a great workout.  It can be modified for beginners but definitely will give an intermediate to advanced person a great workout.  I have become stronger and more toned since doing this workout in the last month.  Jari is good about reminding you about body alignment during the exercises which is good for me.  I really like the superset for the triceps and the shoulder workout.  This is a workout that has taken me out of my plateau.  I am a runner and would occasionaly lift weights but not to the extent that Jari pushes you to go.  She motivates you to continue even though you want to quit which is what I need when lifting weights.  I feel much stronger after only about 4 weeks of doing this DVD twice a week.  I also do her Ripped 1000 once a week as well as run 3 times a week. This DVD focuses more on upper body than lower body which is what I was looking for anyway.,1202860800,3,886,4.195266272189349
2618256,5,B000GTJSVC,"I thought I had the best Jari Love Ripped workout then this one arrived.  This is the hardest and most complete Ripped to date.  You find yourself doing several sets per muscle group and you see why it's called ripped and chiseled.  As per usual this has excellent cueing and you can follow the moves without having to feel ackward.  Jari makes sure to hit all the muscles groups not once, but twice and sometimes three times throughout this workout.  You find yourself doing moves she hasn't introduced in other workout for the ripped series which makes this a complete workout.  You get your heartrate up through out the workout and know before the day is over that you worked you body in a great way.  I like the segments on this and never found myself clock watching like I've done in the past with other workouts.  I've read where someone compared this to her slim and lean workout, I think this is the advanced version if anything.  Great workout one that will get you results and will help you build muscle and get tone all over.  Great head to toe workout.",1201219200,3,1064,4.494791666666667
2618257,5,B000GTJSVC,"I have purchased quite a few excercise DVDs in the past, and I have to say, Jari Love's ""Get Ripped and Chiseled"" is by far THE best. The way that she staggers the reps not only gets quick results, but it also completely helps in staving off boredom. Instead of dreading my workout, I actually look forward to it! I have been using this DVD for about 3 weeks now, and already I see that my arms are more muscular and my thighs and butt are toning up. My husband has noticed too! =0)
The only thing slightly negative that I would say about ""Get Ripped and Chiseled"" is the music. It's like the 'techno' dance-club music from the 90's. I honestly don't mind it, and it seems to work with the beat and reps., but some people might not appreciate it as much as Jari seems too.",1201046400,4,772,4.222972972972973
2618258,5,B000GTJSVC,"I am 56. I taught aerobics for 12 years and ruined my knee. I went into body building and LOVED it but got too bulky. I was doing 30 lb dumb bell bicep  curls and LOOKED like it. I had huge, bulky muscles. I just discovered Jeri a few weeks ago and LOVE her. I am losing bulk and weight.  Her bicep sequence with 5-7 pound weights is a killer. I have purchased 5 of her dvd's and love her so much  that I have sent my daughter, a Stanford athlete, the same dvds. Jeri is amazing. THNXS Jeri ! I am a HUGE fan.",1200787200,10,509,3.8285714285714287
2618259,4,B000GTJSVC,"Although the workout is very tough, Jari does not give very detailed instruction, just a lot of ""good job"" comments. For example, when doing squats, she does not explain how the knees should not extend beyond the toes. I only know this from other workout DVDs where the instructors point out the proper form.
During the cooldown, Jari talks too much. I prefer a more tranquil quiet time for stretching.",1200528000,4,402,4.757142857142857
2618260,5,B000GTJSVC,"This DVD was very challenging, I really love the way Jari pushes you.  You feel like she's right there with you for every exercise.  Her body is testimony that her program works!  Fantastic exercise video.",1200096000,,205,4.8
2618261,5,B000GTJSVC,"Jari Love is a great trainer.  This workout out is a non-stop killer workout; with lots of reps and no stopping.  I could barely walk the next day after all the lunges.  I like her training style; she mixes things up to confuse the muscles into working harder.  She has very good form and passes on good information, to keep the student from injuring themselves. I have all her DVD's and can honestly say; I am not disappointed with any of them.",1199577600,25,445,4.390243902439025
2618262,5,B000GTJSVC,I absolutely love this workout. It is tough and gets results. It is also fast paced and comprehensive. One body part is worked with different exercises until fatigued. I would recommend this dvd to the advanced exercisers.,1199577600,5,222,5.027027027027027
2618263,5,B000GTJSVC,She gives me hope!  I have all of her workouts and love them!  I've had 4 children and I can't believe how much my body has transformed already from her workouts.  I'm really sore but it's a good sore!,1199318400,8,201,4.102564102564102
2618264,5,B000GTJSVC,"My wife took a class known to many as ""Body Pump"".  It's an hour long, high intensity, high rep class that uses free weights and weighted bars to fatigue your muscles to the point of exhaustion.  We've been using this DVD for weeks now and it's great.  She says it's almost just like Body Pump, so if you're into that class, you can buy this dvd and do it at home.  This dvd takes you through a logical course of legwork and upper body work to hit all of your major muscle groups hard.  About the only thing she doesn't concentrate on is Abs, but by the time you're done, you're ready to be done.  If you want a high intensity dvd that really works your muscles in ways you never thought possible, try this!  I used to go to the gym and ""lift weights"".  This is far superior to anything you can put together yourself at the gym.",1198886400,21,828,4.163522012578617
2618265,5,B000GTJSVC,"I just purchased Jari's latest dvd Get Ripped and Chiseled and I must say Jari delivers a great workout once again.  Not the most challenging, but a great overall workout.  This dvd focuses more on the arms, but the leg section is good too.  The hardest part of the workout for me was the shoulder track.  I had to decrease my weight load as did Jari.  I still can't believe Gaylene is 57!",1198713600,9,389,4.273972602739726

The first one I bought was Slim & Lean. I found it at a book store and finally opened it 3 years later. Once I found the motivation to work out, I couldn't believe how good that workout was, so I googled for more videos and now have most of them. I love this workout.  It works every part of your body and you feel like you got the most efficient workout and did it the right way instead of going to a gym and trying to figure out what to do in the free weight area.",1514419200,,605,3.84
8134525,5,B000GTJSVC,"I've been working out with Jari on and off for more than a decade. I really like this DVD even with it's few shortcomings. After doing the work out several times, you have a pretty good idea what's coming up next even if you might have to hustle to get into position. My only real complaint is I feel like the cool down is lacking, but since I own several of her DVDs, I know what to do:) If you're a Ripped! fan and don't have this one yet, you should get it. You won't be sorry.",1502496000,,480,3.9587628865979383

8134532,4,B000GTJSVC,Challenging predominantly upper body workout. Three segments r lower body. Like the tricep segmenta the best. Lungea challenging due to isometric holds and four counts up and down. Pulsing squats are awesome. Some cues could be better. Abs are in the bonus section but only three four minutes.,1455235200,,293,5.125
