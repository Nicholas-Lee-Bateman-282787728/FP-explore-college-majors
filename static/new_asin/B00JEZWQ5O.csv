I can't believe that the DVD was cancelled!!!!!!  I can not express the depth of my disappointment.",1404777600,6,109,5.0
6356276,5,B00JEZWQ5O,Please bring out all 3 fully restored seasons. Can hardly wait!,1404518400,4,63,4.818181818181818
6356277,1,B00JEZWQ5O,"Excited to see that it's finally being released. Hopefully the proper credits order (where the lead for the episode is shown first, which hasn't always been done when they've shown the reruns in the last decade) will be restored, and I assume they'll be unedited. If you want to see how a truly beautiful, professional series restoration is done, check out the Search (1972) set from Warner Brothers. Will definitely be getting this.

UPDATE - 9/28/14

Amazon unlisted the DVD set a while back and cancelled all pre-orders. I Tweeted Shout Factory and they wrote back promptly and told me it was ""not on the schedule at this time"". HUGE disappointment, I was soooo gonna buy this.",1404432000,13,680,4.803418803418803
6356278,5,B00JEZWQ5O,Glad to see they are finally putting one of my favorite shows out on dvd however why did they decide to show a reverse image of the actors?  Not a big deal i suppose ---but still......it seems they could get it straight!,1404345600,5,220,4.238095238095238
6356279,2,B00JEZWQ5O,"though dated this is still a better than average show-the problem is thanks to shout factory not supplying sdh or English subtitles I won't be able to see it, and finally releasing it does me no good whatsoever-so this joins China Beach and others I would buy if they had subtitles. It's a shame companies like Shout , Warner Archives,Olive and others think so little of the customer base that nedd subtitles and would buy their product if they were supplied",1404345600,4,458,4.666666666666667
6356280,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"Thank you from myself and thousands more who don't but should take the time and write, now that there is such good news in the air!  The Name Of The Game is one of those coveted series that is high on the serious TV collectors wish list, and one of those shows that many assumed would continue to be lost.  I remember it as being way over my head as a child, but I am so looking forward to seeeing this with an adult mind!  I hope and pray that this is a first class restroration, and that plans are on the books to release all three seasons ASAP.  Let us all support this effort to bring such a quality show back and make this a best seller DVD set!",1404259200,23,650,3.976923076923077
6356281,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"obviously I'm not commenting on the dvd product (yet), and will update this when it's released, but just want to extend a pre-emptive thanks to TMG/Shout for hopefully bringing out the entire neglected series.

TVshowsondvd reported that a consumer was told by TMG/Shout that all 3 seasons would be released. Also Season One would include the earlier TVmovie pilot. However, TMG only confirmed that Season One was delayed, not cancelled, so the other info is more rumor than fact.",1404086400,18,480,5.075949367088608
8650380,4,B00JEZWQ5O,"Remember having watched this so many years ago. Did find a DVD-R copy of the tv movie,and liked it. Hope it does get released soon.",1528675200,,131,4.28
8650381,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"How sad that Timeless/Shout couldn't get a DVD release of the perpetually elusive ""The Name of the Game"" TV series across the line. I placed my order for series one when it first appeared on the Amazon site and was champing at the bit. Unlike occasional appearances on US cable TV from time to time, most recently with COZI TV apparently, it hasn't aired in Australia in over 42 years.

To my disappointment, the scheduled July 2014 release date passed, it was then postponed until late October before it was cancelled altogether in August. I'd love to know what happened.

In a modern world with virtually every other show we grew up with in the sixties and seventies available now on DVD, why such acute problems with ""The Name of the Game"", which received several Emmy nominations. It's becoming a bit like TV's equivalent of the Beach Boys' ""Smile"" album and even that was eventually released. Network TV's holy grail!!

It was a great show. I loved it and am dying to revisit it.",1407628800,6,984,4.64367816091954
8650382,5,B00JEZWQ5O,So sorry the release of this awesome show has been cancelled. I have been searching for this for years.,1407628800,5,103,4.473684210526316
8650383,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"Been waiting for this release for a long time!  Hopefully Steven Speilberg has given his OK to include ""L.A. 2017""- one of his earliest directorial efforts.  Can't wait!",1406505600,2,169,5.0
8650384,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"Finally! I loved this show when it premiered back in 1968.  It was an early example of a ""wheel"" program where the lead actors would rotate from week to week.  It all took place at Howard Publications, a magazine company run by Glenn Howard (Gene Barry).  Other actors included Robert Stack as Dan Farrell, editor of Crime Magazine, and Tony Franciosa as Jeff Dillon, editor of People Magazine (before there ever was a real-life People Magazine).  Susan St. James as Peggy Maxwell, an editorial assistant was a common thread in most all the episodes and sometimes Barry would make an appearance on the other actors' episodes to maintain continuity. Universal produced the high budget 90 minute series almost as if they were movies for television.  To recoup some of the high production costs each episode was actually released to theatres in Europe as a feature film.  The show was very topical as you would expect and that may be a drawback for some people who will find it outdated.  But the series was innovative in a lot of different ways which makes it worthwhile.  One of the episodes features a modern, greek chorus that would appear between scenes.  Another episode was directed by future superstar director Steven Spielberg and takes place (via dream sequence) in the future.  The stories were all well written and many behind the scenes people (Steven Bochco for example) went on to future success in other shows.  All the episodes featured familiar actors from Universal's stable of contract players at the time.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this show again and I hope seasons two and three are not far behind.",1405987200,9,1630,4.865942028985507
8650385,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"UPDATE: - Per the facebook page 'Remembering The Name of The Game' a guy has posted on 18 November stating he contacted Shout Factory and got a reply advising The First season DVD set has been postponed until 2015 so hopefully we SHOULD see this show on DVD sometime  in the new year !

An expensively made ambitious show by Universal with the 'alternating lead' style -  Gene Barry, Tony Franciosa, and Robert Stack each effortlessly carried the show giving it more depth than the average show with it's 70-75 minute episodes

Hopefully the original 'rotating' opening graphic will be restored which put the featured lead up first on their respective segment episodes (not done in recent TV reruns)

A ground breaking show re the work of the Howard Publications empire and it's two top magazines 'People' and 'Crime',  that featured mainly  'current affairs' stories (Tony Franciosa), crime capers (Robert Stack) and political intrigue / big business tales plus a few surreal 'offbeat' episodes (Gene Barry) as the usual rotation -  In seasons two and three special guest leads were in a few episodes; Darren McGavin, Peter Falk, Robert Wagner, Robert Culp (two episodes) and Vera Miles as other reporters working for / with Howard Publications.

Susan Saint James often appeared as support to all three leads & the occasional guest lead, and look out for a  pre 'Alias Smith and Jones' Ben Murphy in some Robert Stack episodes playing exec asst 'Joe Sample'

Many top guest stars appeared with production work by; Leslie Stevens, Gene L.Coon, Dean Hargrove, Richard Irving, David J. O'Connell ,and a young Steven Bochco, etc, while the third season episode; 'LA. 2017' was directed by the rising talent Steven Spielberg.
Dave Grusin composed the terrific theme tune with music by Dominic Frontiere.

Boris Karloff gave his final acting performance in 'The White Birch' (season one) while Orson Welles narrated 'The Enemy Before Us' (season three)

it seems from the latest info that the second and third seasons WILL follow, plus the 1966 pilot TV Movie; 'Fame is The Name of The Game' starring Tony Franciosa & introducing Susan Saint James

A classic show at long last coming to DVD - hopefully very soon !!!",1405728000,6,2212,4.959349593495935
8650386,5,B00JEZWQ5O,"The greatest thanks for bringing back this fast-moving, interesting series that involves plots to capture you.",1405382400,4,110,5.9375
8650387,5,B00JEZWQ5O,A VERY PLEASANT SURPRISE! I HAD WRITTEN TO BOTH UNIVERSAL AND SHOUT FACTORY A FEW MONTHS AGO AND BOTH SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT SCHEDULE FOR RELEASE ANYTIME SOON. COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THEY WERE WRONG! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS OUTSTANDING SERIES FOR MANY YEARS NOW. I JUST HOPE THAT HOPE THAT THE RELEASE BETWEEN SEASONS ISN'T VERY LONG!!!,1405296000,5,336,4.711864406779661
8650388,3,B00JEZWQ5O,how are they going to put 1950 mins on 1 dvd has to be a big error hope so.,1405123200,2,75,3.0
8650389,5,B00JEZWQ5O,It will be awesome!  I remember watching this show every week while I was in HS.  I loved the drama and how they dressed!  Will the new release DVD be closed-captioned.  My hearing is not as good as I used to have.  I'd appreciate a reply from those producing the new DVD.,1404950400,3,272,4.153846153846154
