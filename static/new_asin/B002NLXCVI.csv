8375131,5,B002NLXCVI,"The Nazis Strike is the second of seven documentaries from the Why We Fight series directed by Frank Capra.  Released between 1942 and 1945, these films were shown to American military personnel for instructional purposes; they also served as American propaganda during World War II.  With the use of animated maps and combat footage, this film is a good overview of how Germany sought to control the world by first controlling the land areas.  Once the natural resources and population of the land areas of the world were controlled, world conquest would be complete.  We also see how Germany re-militarized the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, consumed the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938, and invaded Poland in 1939.  At about forty-two minutes in length this film is ideal for middle or high school teachers looking for a concise but informative overview of the events leading to World War II.  However, it does contain some disturbing images (dead bodies, emotionally distraught people, and wounded children) so teachers may want to prepare their students ahead of time before showing.  Still, despite its age, The Nazis Strike is an effective teaching tool.",1519689600,,1180,5.146596858638744
8375132,3,B002NLXCVI,"This program is very good at zeroing in on the Nazis to show how ordinary people did terrible things within the framework of the larger state. It also does an excellent job of explaining the Nazi world view. I have always been a history person and have started to watch more Nazi programs. Part of Frank Capra's """"Why We Fight"""" series.",1292630400,2,336,4.524590163934426
8375133,5,B002NLXCVI,"Really nice footage, and explanations for the quick, fast paced actions of the Nazi's. This film shows the speed and fury of the Nazi Blitzkreig War Machine. The Picture in this footage has been upgraded, but still not up to HD standards.

Great film, very educational. My Class loved it.",1276473600,,288,4.76
