8457779,3,B0055CAISM,"As of this writing, Uwe Boll has slid from spotlight. It's been about seven years since one of his movies received anything resembling a wide theatrical release in America, and in general, it seems as though the quality of his films has improved. Watching this documentary now constitutes a trip back in time to when Boll was the internet's public enemy and the biggest fear of video game fans was that he would direct a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metroid/dp/B00004SVYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metroid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metal-Gear-Solid/dp/B00001X50M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metal Gear Solid</a>&nbsp;adaptation. Anyone who remembers that time would probably find interest in seeing this. ""Raging Boll"" is an intimate albeit one-sided and ultimately tragic examination of one of the least-expected pop culture phenomena of the new millennium, and a pretty decent film despite its eventual depressing tone.

The movie chronicles a period in the life of Boll - approximately most of 2006 - wherein the pressures of limited Hollywood success and nonstop harassment from online commentators drives the filmmaker to issue his infamous boxing challenge to a handful of detractors. Basically, there's an overview of the online situation, followed by a review of his upbringing and history with film, his attempts to release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Name-of-the-King-A-Dungeon-Siege-Tale/dp/B00140PK82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale</a>&nbsp;through a major studio, a buildup to and eventual montage of the fights themselves, and a quick glance at the struggle of releasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Postal/dp/B0019F02UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Postal</a>.

How much a viewer enjoys this film may be reliant on one's ability to empathize. Boll consistently labels himself as an outsider - a claim based on his inability to integrate himself into the Hollywood system and become more than an independent filmmaker - and much of the documentary chronicles him fighting an uphill battle to have his movies shown on a large scale. It genuinely seems that making a film is a cakewalk compared to getting it into theaters for Boll, and the production does a fantastic job of capturing the stress and apprehension that he experiences while trying to convince studio representatives to take on his finished product. The scenes of him attempting to sell ""In the Name of the King"" are my favorite part of the film, being arguably the most dramatically-charged portion. His frustration is apparent: I kept waiting for a scene wherein agents rush past Boll and step on his feet in a frenzy to secure&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000NTPDT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;ahead of his film, but even though this doesn't happen, it's probably an accurate representation of how Boll feels snubbed by the studio system.

The movie implies that this is what leads to the matches: with limited professional success to keep him occupied, Boll shifts his focus to and grants credence to his online detractors. This is the selling point of the documentary, and it shows both the worst of Boll and of the online entities in general. What Uwe experienced in the form of attacks on his character comes very close to mobbing, and his virtual critics come across as malicious and immature jerks. The group that eventually shows up to box is a more subdued bunch, clearly intimidated by Boll as he spars in front of them and they realize how extreme this stunt is (one of the guys literally shakes as he's taped up before his fight). Boll beats his detractors bloody, causing one to vomit. This is such a sad climax because absolutely nobody comes across as a winner; even Boll looks uncomfortable and dejected as he walks from the ring. His commentary takes a noticeable turn for the worse, and the last substantial portion of the film is a repetitious, profane bluster in which he assigns blame for his situation to everybody but himself. The well-educated, passionate doctor degenerates into an angry, delusional man who's resorted to violence out of desperation.

The movie makes me wonder about the transition from ""underdog"" to ""victim"" and how much frustration and hardship one can reasonably be expected to endure before turning cynical. Boll reaches that point, and boy does it get ugly. What we have here is a no-win situation in which moral superiority becomes a non-issue in favor of name-calling and pugilism. I appreciate Boll receiving a platform to tell his side of the tale, but while it succeeds in making his detractors look bad, it certainly doesn't make him look good. ""Raging Boll"" is an interesting movie, but at best, it's a pessimistic cautionary tale that doesn't make you feel good for watching.",1430870400,2,5042,5.791105121293801
8457780,4,B0055CAISM,"I'm not a Boll hater, or a Boll fan boy. But after seeing the venom that's been spewed at this man, I wanted to hear his side of the story, and this film delivered. I recommend this documentary to those who are curious about Uwe Boll, how he became a filmmaker, his views on the business, and how he deals with the constant criticism. There were only two things I didn't like about this DVD.

First, the audio was WAY too soft. In order to hear dialogue clearly, I had to triple the volume I normally use.

Second, I was hoping for participation from those who had worked with Boll, such as actors, film crew, script writers, or investors. There is a brief appearance by some of his family (father, mother, and aunt), as well as some comments from those he faced during the boxing match. Besides that, it's just Boll talking, and it becomes repetitive. My understanding is that this documentary was filmed over a three year period. They couldn't find anyone else to interview?

Herr Boll did appear defensive at times, but if I had been struck by a tsunami of vitriol, I'd probably be defensive as well. The only film of his that I've watched (and liked) was the unrated cut of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Name-of-the-King-A-Dungeon-Siege-Tale-Blu-ray/dp/B001EZE5AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale [Blu-ray</a>], and that was because of its unintentional comedic value. Gotta love Matthew Lillard: ""Hip-hip huzzah!"" ""One would imagine that he farms!"", etc. I may not enjoy Boll's movies, or agree with his opinions. But I do respect his drive and determination.

Video quality of this 16x9 transfer was good. Audio left something to be desired (see comment above). Bonus Features are weak. They consist of trailers for six films: Raging Boll, Bloodrayne 3, Blubberella, Haunting at the Beacon, Jack Said, and Max Schmeling. After three years of filming, I expected some bonus footage, but there wasn't any.",1393459200,2,2001,5.147692307692307
8457781,2,B0055CAISM,"I don't know what the two positive raters saw but either we saw different movies, they're friends/family with the filmmakers, or they worked on it themselves.  I saw this little ""documentary"" after listening to Boll consistently boast during the commentary on his Director's Cut of Alone In the Dark how he challenged his harshest critics to a boxing match (yeah because boxing someone will really change the fact you can't direct).  After a promising start (hence the 2 star rating), the film then becomes Boll's Hour where he basically uses it to rant against the Hollywood machine.  After awhile it becomes painfully obvious that he's bitter and he has only himself to blame by now.  He makes junk and by junk I mean movies that aren't even fun junk.  See it for what it is but don't be surprised if you've already forgotten it before the final credits roll.",1376784000,,861,4.751677852348993
8457782,1,B0055CAISM,"It's quite simple. The man is incredibly defensive about his crap movies and whilst the most logical path would be to direct a masterpiece to silence your critics, he decides to challenge them to a boxing match. I was hoping the boxing would be the focal point just so I could have a bit of a chuckle at nerds getting the crap beaten out of them by a crazy German but instead ~90% of the film is Uwe Boll playing the victim and how he goes on these incoherent diatribes of how people don't understand his art. I would not recommend this 'documentary' to anyone.",1368576000,,561,4.352380952380952
8457783,5,B0055CAISM,"In short I loved this movie and would recommend it to any filmmaker or aspiring filmmaker. The reason is simple, while you may or may not like Uwe Boll's movies, when it comes to the movie business he is in a league of his own. At the time this movie was made, Uwe had through his Boll KG raised over $250 million US to finance his movies. The number one thing I hear movie-makers whine about is that they struggle to raise financing for their projects. They could learn a lot from Uwe Boll in that regard. Since watching this I have watched several of Uwe's movies and clearly the man does not get the respect he deserves. But clearly this is a man to learn from when it comes to the business side of film-making.",1364774400,4,714,4.257352941176471
8457784,4,B0055CAISM,"This film was a real eye opener for me. I knew Uwe Boll was hated, but I had no idea it had gotten that out of control. This film really humanizes Uwe Boll and quite literally puts his critics to rest. This is a must see to understand the man and a legacy that he is all too aware of. Great narrative.",1323820800,8,301,3.870967741935484
