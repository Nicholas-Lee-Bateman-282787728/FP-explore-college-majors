8285857,4,B001C4CADS,"In 2002, director Ryuhei Kitamura was challenged to to do something very usual -- make a full-length movie made with one week's shooting time. One setting. Two actors. A fight.

The result... is kind of like a rock'n'roll samurai version of ""My Dinner With Andre,"" where two men contemplate the meaning of life and death, and the value of either when a person is immortal. But with more booze, swords, guns, severed limbs and the occasional upgrade to godhood. ""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" is a weird, wild movie with a slow-burning fuse... right before it explodes into sparking, sword-swinging action.

A wounded samurai (Takao Ohsawa) drags his dying friend (Hideo Sakaki) into a shrine during a thunderstorm. When he wakes up, he finds that his wounds have healed, his friend is dead and cremated, and he's the guest of a very peculiar man (Masaya Kat) and a silent woman (Kanae Uotani). Since it's not yet safe to go outside, the samurai reluctantly agrees to stay and drink with his host, who has a collection of alcohol and weapons from all across the world.

But he soon discovers that something very weird is up with this man. The man claims to be a war god -- an ""aragami"" -- who and he has done something horrifying to turn the samurai into a nearly-invincible immortal.

What is the aragami's reason for doing all of this? He's tired of living an immortal life... and cue Queen's ""Who Wants To Live Forever?"" But as a war-god, he can't die except by being defeated by someone in one-on-one combat. He's also one of Japan's most famous historical figures, who was famous for... being incredibly good at fighting and killing people. Despite that, the samurai finds himself forced into the ultimate sword battle that will decide both their destinies.

""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" is a very odd movie. At least eighty percent of it is just two guys sitting in a single small room, drinking and talking. And at first, it's not particularly scary -- the silence and sudden appearances of the Aragami and the Woman are offputting, but not necessarily unnatural. But he drops subtle hints at the unnatural qualities of these people, through careful lighting (which often makes the Aragami look strangely undead) and peculiar evasions.

After the Aragami reveals his nature, Kitamura slowly unravels the conversation into a discussion about life, death, suicide, immortality and divinity. He occasionally livens things up with some humor (the Samurai throws back a whole glass of vodka... and regrets it) and action (severed limbs, impalement), but it's fundamentally a very philosophical film. The battle and the conflict are not ones of hatred and hostility, but of some deep primal inclination to fight.

For instance, one of the most intriguing scenes is when the Aragami offers the Samurai his choice of various weapons, including a broadsword, a very modern pistol, Wolverine claws and throwing stars. In another movie, this would be a tense scene, but it's oddly relaxed as the two men prepare to kill each other, and the Aragami pleasantly offers his opinions about the virtues of different weapons.

And despite the medieval setting, the director also gives the whole experience a strangely rock'n'roll, modern flavor -- especially since the Aragami somehow has access to vodka, French wine and a bunch of weapons from different times and places. The rock soundtrack doesn't hurt either.

This is a movie that relies heavily on its actors, and both of them are absolutely perfect. Kat plays his character with almost inhuman coolness and casualness -- he seems like a very cool, interesting guy who would be fun to hang out with... except he's also a war-god who seems to be missing some compassion chips. He even seems to change physically through the movie, looking more solid and grand at the climax, with a mane of red-tinged hair.

Ohsawa balances him out nicely -- he IS just an ordinary guy at the start, and he reacts to the various shocking revelations in exactly the way you'd expect. Fear, horror, puking, hysterical laughter, and even a bit of grinning crazy. But his character transforms into something colder and deadlier as the movie wears on, as if he were being refined down to his purest form of self. Ohsawa handles the transition beautifully.

With only two speaking actors and a single room to play out their battle, ""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" could have been a really boring movie. Instead, it's a fascinating little movie about battling with words and swords.",1428278400,,4518,4.908256880733945
8285858,5,B001C4CADS,"Made as part of the DUEL project along with Yukihiki Tsutsumi`s 2LDK, the famed project had certain limiting rules that applied to both films:
1) Both films will only be shot, edited, in a measly 7 days, under a very small budget.
2) Both films would be limited to an enclosed space with a limited running time--one room, one setting.
3) There will be a Limit of three major characters. (onscreen)
4) One character has to die.

Ryuhei Kitamura's highly entertaining experimental film; ""ARAGAMI"" was produced together with Tsutsumi's film under those rules. The famed director responsible for such acclaimed hits such as ""Versus"" and the award-winning film ""Azumi"". Aragami and 2LDK are films very different and also very similar. They both have a witty, simplistic charm that revolves around a claustrophobic feel and exciting action. Kitamura was said to have written this film while he was filming ""Azumi""--the resulting film further cements his claim to be one of Japan's foremost director's in samurai action films.

Two samurai warriors end up outside a creepy temple in the woods and are met by a very beautiful woman (Kanae Uotani, The Messenger). Both are badly wounded because of a great battle. One of them would awaken (Takao Osawa) and find all his wounds healed. Greeted by his supposed ""savior"" (Masaya Kato, Fighter in the Wind) and his female companion, the surviving samurai is now forced to repay his debt by engaging the man who had saved his life in a battle to the death. His ""savior"" is a supposed warrior who had lived for a long time, and he is longing to be defeated in battle. But only the greatest warrior may overcome this ""tengu"" in battle....

Those familiar with Ktamura's work will no doubt be pleased with this film. ""Aragami"" may have a very different atmosphere and the familiar approach of the acclaimed director is so visible in the film's screenplay. As such, the film almost generates a feeling of nostalgia for his fans--the sword used by one of the main combatants in ""Versus"" is even used by our mysterious character and even cult favorite Tak Sakaguchi (Death Trance) makes a cameo appearance. ""Aragami"" is so full of momentum, and unbelievably simple--mindless entertainment can be a real treat when done right. The film has two elements that work well: its dialogue and action--made to mesh real well in pace, it succeeds in taking the viewer to a mythical and almost enchanted world.

It is to be duly noted that it was wise for Kitamura to utilize the services of his usual film crew. The very cool camerawork by Takumi Furuya is impressively executed with his usual familiar signature shots. I was impressed as to how Kitamura and company managed to make the temple a character in itself--the colors were restrained but the grayish earthly colors gave the setting a lot of personality and mood. I do believe that this was done intentionally to give emphasis to the costumes worn by our characters; which were very simple but elaborate. It was nice to see the two conversing characters wearing similar colors with the mysterious woman who wore a very nice purple and white kimono. It gave the threesome an almost mythic persona that borders on being magical and mysteriously seductive--almost like the ""Twilight Zone"". The musical score by Nobuhiko Morino adds and complements the film's energetic atmosphere; it sounded like a wild blend of Japanese traditional music and almost techno-like beat. The atmosphere just feels so suitable for a duel to the death.

""Aragami"" has a lot of dialogue but not one scene is wasted. It practices a simple pace: sit, eat, fight, drink, drink again, fight--but it doesn't feel repetitive. The film is short at 80 minutes but honestly it felt a little longer because of the touches of humor, an interesting script that serves to develop the characters and attained a needed stroke of maturity. After all, any fight fest will have to have a great set-up otherwise it would feel unnecessary. I loved the part when our ""tengu"" gave hints to our mysterious woman's background (Kanae Uotani is so beautiful). The sequence when they looked at their possible weapons were also a stroke of clever calculation on Kitamura`s part--it exuded an almost child-like playful scenario. The needed dialogue established the groundwork as to why, who, and how our characters are related. It gives a needed amount of credibility as to why they need to fight.

Our two actors don't really have a martial arts background so Kitamura had to pull some editing tricks to make them look good and makes them look convincing that the two are real samurai warriors well-versed in the workings of the swordplay. The fight scenes are kept compact with the shot following the action with some use of ""shaky"" camera work but fortunately, it didn`t look sloppy or overdone. The fight sequences looked very cool, with the posturing exuding pure machismo. It had the dangerous potential to be overly flashy but Kitamura manages to keep the fight scenes grounded; the results looked very precise, stylish and full of finesse. Lighting effects and atmosphere played a vital part in the film's fight sequences which I've read that it may have been nominated for ""fight scene of the year"".

Ryuhei Kitamura's ""Aragami"" may not be wholly original--but given the fact that the film was shot and edited in a measly seven days with a very small budget, damn, the man is one awesome director to pull off this kind of quality filmmaking. ""Aragami"" wins over the darkly satirical ""2LDK"" hands down although I do equally like both films. This film will no doubt entertain and engage its audience; with its well-rounded script, cool atmosphere and excellently edited fight sequence--its main reward is the journey.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]
 Anyone wants me to review ""2LDK""?
