1831970,2,B0000897AD,"Back in the early 1970s someone (producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, I believe) got the bright idea to mix the genres of blaxploitation and horror, the result being the film Blacula (1972), which did well enough commercially to warrant a sequel titled Scream Blacula Scream (1973).  Neither film was particularly favored by critics, but audiences enjoyed them, as they soon developed cult followings.  This prompted others to try their hand at the newly formed hybrid genre, including producer Frank R. Saletri with his release of Blackenstein (1973), which he also wrote.  Directed by William A. Levey (Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman, Skatetown, U.S.A.), the film stars John Hart (""The Lone Ranger"", ""Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans"") and Ivory Stone, in her only silver screen appearance.  Also appearing is Joe De Sue, Roosevelt Jackson (China Heat), Andrea King (The Lemon Drop Kid), and a list of others really not worth mentioning (after watching the film last night I'm betting those that were mentioned probably wish they weren't).

As the film begins we see an African American woman named Dr. Winifred Walker (Stone) arriving in California by plane, renting a car, and driving to a large house in the hills owned by her former teacher named Dr. Stein (Hart), who, as we learn later, has recently won the Nobel prize for solving the human genetic code, no less.  Oh brother...anyway, seems Winifred's boyfriend, one Eddie Turner (De Sue), has recently returned from service overseas sans his arms and legs (he had an unfortunate incident with a landmine), and Winifred's hoping Dr. Stein can make him whole again.  Stein agrees to help, and has Eddie transferred to his home, which actually doubles as a pseudo research facility where the doctor performs his wacky experimental testing (Dr, Stein has a whole lot of electrical gizmos whose only purpose seems to be in creating electricity arcs).  As Winifred and Dr. Stein surgically graft some limbs on Eddie (which isn't shown) and begin juicing him up with DNA injections, Malcolm (Jackson), Stein's monosyllabic assistant, falls hard for Winifred, but she turns him out (she's in love with Eddie), to which Malcolm decides to tinker with Eddie's injection formula, enough so to turn him into a hulking, hideous, homicidal brute complete with his very own uni-brow who wears Beetle boots.  While Winifred and Dr. Stein try to figure out the cause of Eddie's de-evolution (Dr. Stein's solution is to up the injection dosage), monster Eddie begins sneaking out at night, at first taking revenge on those who wronged him (like the idiotic, sadistic orderly at the VA hospital), but eventually killing anyone (or anything) that comes across his path.  This, of course, draws the attention of the authorities, eventually leading up to a confrontational sequence hardly worth sticking around for...

First off I must say I wasn't expecting much coming into this film as I was resigned to it being a novelty at best.  Problem was, once the novelty wore off, about a third of the way in, it turned into something akin to Chinese water torture, but, being the tenacious movie viewer I am, I plowed ever forward...hey, I figure if I could sit through Jerry Warren's abysmal Frankenstein Island (1981), I could sit through anything (I won't kid you, as Blackenstein did put that notion to the test).  What Blackenstein lacked in competency, it made up for in an overall sense of suck.  You know, I've always admired those renegade filmmakers who don't constrain themselves in terms of such antiquated ideas like a coherent plot, something which others would consider a fundamental aspect of a feature.  To be fair, there is something of a plot here, all of about ten minutes worth (the movie runs about 87 minutes).  I guess one doesn't need a lengthy plot when one has something like 982 establishing shots.  For those not familiar, an establishing shot is one which gives the viewer an idea where parts of a movie are taking place, an example being if a film is set in California, we might see a character flying into a Los Angeles airport.  For some reason director Levey decided it was necessary to show endless exterior shots of Dr. Stein's house, even though it had been established numerous times previously that's where we were at...I guessing this was an effort to pad out the running time, but it could have been a result of lousy direction.  Regardless, if this were the only problem with the movie, I could have let it slide, but there was so much more...the continuity was out of whack (there were many sequences that were supposed to take place at night, except it was obviously shot during the daytime, and vice versa), the pacing was disjointed, due primarily to awkward cut away shots, the film was poorly lit, and the fact whomever placed the music within the film had little idea how to do so appropriately.  There were a number of times some ominous piece of music would start playing, even though the scene didn't call for it...there was also a good dose of soul music included, which didn't really fit in all that well (at least the music chosen), but I half expected that given the blaxploitation elements of the feature.  As far as the actors go, there were two types here...those who've had a viable career in the past, but have found themselves stuck appearing in films like this, and those who've never appeared in a film prior (or since) this feature (the actor who played Eddie had the personality of a two by four).  There was some blood and unnecessary gore (monster Eddie seemed to enjoy pulling peoples faux spaghetti guts from their mutilated corpses), along with a bit of welcomed nekkidness (there's one decent topless scene).  As I said, there's not much of a story, but that's okay because the film is padded out with stupid crapola like a crummy comic (sadly monster Eddie never catches up to this guy) performing in a sleazy nightclub (his material is most definitely rank), followed by an African American woman belting out a soulful tune.  I'm sure if we spoke to the makers of this film today they'd probably make the claim Blackenstein was intended as a parody, but I'll call it what it is, a soulless, craptastic piece of flotsam, one created with the hopes of cashing in on the Blacula films, and failing miserably.  I'm going to give this two stars rather than one for the following reasons...

1. It gave me the opportunity to see Frankenstein's monster with an afro.

2. The topless girl outside the nightclub.

3. It was good for a few laughs.

4. The DVD artwork is entertaining.

5. Despite the film's overall dismalness, it was still better than Frankenstein Island.

The picture, presented in fullscreen, on this Xenon Pictures DVD release, comes across okay, and the audio is clear (there was no mention of the actual format of the latter).  There are chapter stops, but not much in the way of extras except preview trailers of other Xenon DVD releases including Dolemite: The Human Tornado (1976), Durdy Game (2002), Fubar (2002), Tar (1997), Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake (2001), and Welcome to Death Row (2001).

Most of the acting is atrocious, the sets in conjunction with the cameras are pretty good, and it features the  Frankenstein equipment from the original film (Strickfaden dragged it out for this film and also Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein).  The plot is time capsule relevant- a black man comes back from Vietnam with no limbs, and his scientist girlfriend contacts her old professor who has a background in cellular regrowth (RNA, DNA mumbo jumbo for plot purposes... now, if RNA causes people to freak out, wouldn't they just stick with the DNA... oh well, it's all for the good of the monster).  Kudos go to this film for portraying a black woman as a take control doctor/scientist and also for portraying VA hospitals as a little subpar (this was the early 70s).  Well, the Basket Case boyfriend has some new limbs thrown on, and a lab assistant with the hots for the girl scientist winds up pulling an Rna switcheroo, causing confusion and disemboweling to abound, (or unbound, depending on how you tie your bellybutton).  Throw in some bad standup, some mediocre Liz Renay, and some great attack dogs and you're in for a weird time.

Unfortunately, the experiment goes awry, and Eddie suddenly develops a square afro, takes to wearing ankle boots, and sneaks out at night... and one of his first victims is an ugly white woman with a really bad hair-do and bad taste in pink nighties.
On the surface, BLACKENSTEIN would seem everything a cult-movie fan could ever wish.  And it is true, there are about six ""howlers"" per minute in this film--actors who can't act, ridiculous dialogue, bad cinematography, awful special effects, extremely silly make-up, you name it, this flick has it.  Trouble is, BLACKENSTEIN is also incredibly, unspeakably dull.  In fact, it is so dull that after about ten minutes its dullness overpowers the giggle factor and you are left to sit in slack-jawed exhaustion.  The DVD offers nothing in the way of extras and the print is bad to boot--not that it makes any difference where this film is concerned.  If you have to buy a gift for some you don't much like, this would be a perfect choice.  Otherwise, steer clear.

John Hart also was involved in the production of the tv series ""Quincy."" I enjoyed this movie immensely, and though John would probably admit that this is not his favorite movie, he does yeomanlike work within the limitations of a weak script and low budget set. There are some unexpectedly hilarious moments in the film. An athletic and impressively swift young lady is nevertheless caught in a race with the lumbering monster.

This is my first review of an Xenon Picures DVD release. As normal I tend to focus and award stars on the product and not the movie.

Firstly it must be noted that Blackenstein is a low budget movie not expected to make big DVD revenue so I wasn't expecting a fully remastered product with loads of extras however what I got was below par.

Most obvious is the 4:3 aspect ratio on the DVD compared to the original 1.85.1 AR in which it was produced (IMDB).  The lack of subtitles is also a big negative. The transfer is a bit below average and it looks like it has been taken off a VHS which might expalin the 4:3 aspect ratio.
On the plus side the movie is pretty close to the original run time and also has the complete intro and credits that poor quality DVDs often lack. It does have a limited main menu with scene selection.

I would have given this 3 stars but for the hefty price tag of $17. I picked up mine on discount for $4.55 which is closer to what it's worth.  It gets 2 stars.

Unfortunately this is the only DVD copy out there so I would suggest fans of this movie wait until this release hits the bargain bins.",1362787200,3,1268,4.6891891891891895

1831995,1,B0000897AD,"This is a crazy film with only one prime goal in mind - to make blacks look like fools and cash in on black box office hits like Superfly and Shaft!  This is film has the usual black stereotypes: A black sidekick cop named ""Jackson,"" black women always taking their clothes off (the whites ones DID NOT!), a foolish looking square afro, black men who are only concerned with sex even if they have to take it.  If they could have thrown in pimping and drug dealing, they would have.

This is one of the few blaxploitation films that I saw that was written and produced by an Italian.  Most were at least produced and/or directed by Jews, while the best of the best were written and directed by blacks.  The writer's (if you can call him that) clear goal was to just make a black version of Frankenstein, even though I never thought of Frankenstein as a race.  I suppose he began his thought processes with curiosities about blacks.  Blackenstein could have had a low hair cut since the guy who turned into him did.  No, he had to make him have a big square afro!

The director seemed to have made his plan by assuming that dark scenes means scary!  It could also mean that it was a means to compensate for weak 'special effects.' He also felt that women having their shirts ripped off ala Jerry Springer would be exciting!  It adds nothing to the film and only shows how low some hoes would stoop for a film - a very low budget one at that. I would bet that they got no more than $300 for their parts.

Amazon has this film as 1973, but at the end it says 1972.  The source that I got it from said 1974, but it is 1972.  So, Blackenstein can deflect bullets, blows to the head, he can rip arms off without even trying, but in the end, he get's eaten up by dogs?  Who thought about this?  Oh yeah, someone who did not care about blacks but was only trying to make a quick buck and make blacks look stupid at the same time.  I say damn the black ""actors"" who played in this film.  Is a check THAT important? I guess so since they keep doing it. This is a sad film on all levels.  Stick with quality like Shaft or Superfly.

Oh yeah, the only thing good about this was the comdeian on stage with his jokes and his interview by the cops.  HE was the only thing good.  I wish I knew his name...",1284768000,,2288,4.164009111617312

""Blackenstein"" has it all--including a flawlessly scratched and grainy print transferred right onto the DVD.

You want bad acting?  You got it.  Factual/continuity/technical errors?  Yep.  Plot holes that an 18-wheeler could be driven through?  Sure.  REALLY bad dialogue (""since the doctor won the Nobel Peace Prize for medicine...."")?  It abounds.  Scenes in which someone appears to have forgotten the camera running and, for no apparent reason, decided to include the resulting footage in the film?  You bet.

Some things are truly so bad they're good, and ""Blackenstein"" fits the bill as well as any other cinematic oopsie I've ever seen.

Blackenstein: The Black Frankenstein is an awful, awful movie.  Quite possibly the worst ever made.

Longer version:

It's a shame that Blackenstein isn't widely known.  If it had the cult following that it ""deserves,"" then it would appear on a lot more ""Worst Movies Ever Made"" lists.  I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but Blackenstein certainly gives&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manos-the-Hands-of-Fate/dp/B0000AGWMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manos, the Hands of Fate</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-from-Outer-Space/dp/B000FAOCCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>&nbsp;a run for their money at the top of my list as the very worst.

Where do you start to describe a movie that makes Ed Wood look like a near-genius?  This movie was edited with all the grace and subtlety of a meat cleaver.  The dialogue (when there is dialogue) is laughable.  The premise of the movie itself is ridiculous (A man steps on a landmine, loses all of his limbs, but otherwise survives unscathed?  Shouldn't he at least be missing his lower jaw, or an eye, or his hearing, or SOMETHING???)

The movie's continuity defies the laws of time and space in ways I haven't seen since ""Plan 9.""  There's an entrance to the Veteran's Hospital that appears to be located in an abandoned factory/warehouse.  The factory/warehouse itself may or may not be right next door to the mansion.  Time shifts from day to night to dusk to night to dusk without any sense of whether or not an actual day has gone by.  After a while, you just have to stop trying to figure it out, and let them take you along for the ride.

The music is the most poorly selected and poorly placed that I've ever encountered in a movie.  Who knew that an 8-track cassette of ""Good King Wenceslas"" was a primo choice for makeout music?  Not to mention the moments that the music suddenly fades out in the middle of a scene.  And, if this is a blaxploitation horror movie, shouldn't there be less classical music and more whahkuh-chickuh-whahkuh-chickuh guitars?

And then there's the scene where Blackenstein is aimlessly wandering around FOR FOUR STRAIGHT MINUTES.  There's a man without any arms or legs, whose limbs are clearly visible under the sheets as he's being removed from an ambulance.  There are DNA genetic codes being cracked by a ""doctor"" who is using some of the same equipment that was used in the lab of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;movie.  They're injecting liquid DNA into their patients!  I could go on and on, but ultimately, this movie must be seen to be believed.

There are so many questions left unanswered.  But it sure is entertaining to watch it again and come up with more questions, such as: Why didn't Mystery Science Theater 3000 get their hands on this one?  Why do all of those cops show up at the end of the movie, and where on Earth do they go?  Why doesn't the DVD box's tagline (""To stop this mutha takes one bad brutha"") have ANYTHING to do with the movie?

I'm pretty sure that watching Blackenstein is the very definition of the phrase ""hurts so good...""",1178323200,5,3328,5.3687258687258685

Several films immediately come to mind for me, and interestingly enough, most of them are exploitation films.  Such is the case for todays movie, BLACKENSTEIN.  I knew from the start what I was going in to with this one, and I still had a great time with it.  You just cant help yourself.  The film is definitely so bad, its good.  If you like schlocky, C-grade horror comedy, then youve come to the right place.  BLACKENSTEIN is the film for you.

I had heard of films like BLACKULA and whatnot, but I confess BLACKENSTEIN was new to me.  When I first got the press release, I was immediately interested, though.  The concept was simply too rich to pass up.  And sure enough, I got exactly what I was expecting.

BLACKENSTEIN looks pretty good onscreen for the most part.  The HD transfer appears to have done the source material a lot of good, although I do have to say there are still many grainy scenes.  Im assuming this is due to a lack of quality in the original negative, although I cannot say for sure.  The second version of the film (the directors cut, with additional footage) has a disclaimer that states the source material could not be upgraded, therefore the additions do not have the same quality as the original film.  I watched both versions of the film, and the additional footage doesnt really add much to the story, therefore you're not missing out if you only watch the original theatrical release (Im glad they put the disclaimer up there, though!).

The acting in BLACKENSTEIN is downright awful, but it is exactly what a film like this should have.  This movie does not (and should not) take itself seriously, therefore the actors shouldnt either.  Actress Ivory Stone (whose sole IMDB credit is this film) is pretty much the main character, but her acting is wooden and lifeless.  I would swear I could sometimes see her eyes flick to a cue card as she read her dialogue, much like guests have to do on Saturday Night Live.  John Hart, who portrays Dr. Stein, gives a better performance, but even he is restricted by a flat and nonsensical script.

The special effects are lacking, however they seem to be the only part of this film that was taken seriously.  A decent effort was put into making them look real (particularly the gore), however they still come across as laughable in some aspects.  Still, I do have to commend the production team on trying.

BLACKENSTEIN is a great flick to make fun of, and despite how bad it is, I did enjoy myself while watching it.  You obviously cannot take it seriously, therefore make sure you have the proper mindset going into it.  If you do, you're in for a real treat.  BLACKENSTEIN is available now.",1497484800,,2759,4.586912065439673
7980822,1,B0000897AD,Amazon really needs to add a ZERO stars. This was just terrible in every way possible. Definitely one of the worst Blaxploitation movies I've ever seen.,1487203200,,152,4.884615384615385
7980823,5,B0000897AD,"Five stars for this hilariously campy spin on the Frankenstein legend. The tag line says it all: ""To stop this mutha takes one bad brutha."" Acting is horrible at times, but innocently forgivable (what notable thespian could deliver some of these lines anyway?). Production values are weak, and ever technical department is substandard by Hollywood standards. But no one in LaLa Land is making movies like BLACKENSTEIN, so the judging criteria must be adjusted!",1481846400,,460,5.22972972972973
7980824,1,B0000897AD,"I love films of the 70s, certainly those of the exploitation genre. So when I saw that Blackenstein was going to be on one of the channels I got I was so excited.

Boy was that dumb.

Being that this is a Blaxploitation film, one would think this would have some kind of thrill or fun about it but Blackenstein is the most boring and bland Frankenstein film that you could ever imagine. Only willing to waste one hour instead of the two it asked of me, I watched without a doubt the slowest paced lifeless adaptation of Frankenstein.

For the hour I was willing to sit through it mainly consisted of a woman talking to a doctor, asking for him to work on her boyfriend who lost his arms and legs in Vietnam. Now, it wouldve been interesting to perhaps explore that backstory. Maybe hearing from the guy and hearing his anger over losing his limbs in a war he maybe didn't even want to fight in or the sacrifices he made and he arrived home only to people angry at him for fighting in Vietnam..but no.

The guy who plays Blackenstein has either never acted in his entire life or was going through a serious bout of depression at the time because I think a rotting corpse on the strings of an amateur puppeteer wouldve had more to offer.

If you really want Blackenstein, just read the original story and imagine that its the corpse of a black man, because this movie will bore you to the point where no psychotic doctor could ever resurrect your soul.",1480982400,,1450,4.37546468401487
