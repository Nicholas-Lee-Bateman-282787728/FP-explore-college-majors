A suave but down-and-out would-be concert violinist on his way to an audition, is mistaken for a waiter and discovers a new, if not terribly legal or honest, source of income. I won't say anything more, I don't want to spoil the fun.

Good writing, creative gags, a fine sense of irony, and a refreshing respect for the audience's intelligence.

Sadly, the ironic punchline ending (a scrolling text epilogue) from the U.S. release was conspicuously absent from the Czech-release DVD I managed to obtain, but the film is otherwise intact and entertaining.

I can't recommend this highly enough!",1515456000,,757,4.8984375
7900832,5,8024730073,"This is a wonderful and charming Czech flick, full of the charm and innocence that the Czech filmmakers are so famous for. If you have seen Kolya, Autumn Spring or Three Veterans it will love it for its comedy, humor and great acting. Here again, Libue afrnkov and Zdenk Svrk both give a marvelous acting performance and Jaroslav Uhl's music and singing hit it right on to complete the picture.",1488844800,,394,4.642857142857143
