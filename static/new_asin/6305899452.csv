Very good story - sticks with the real story line of the book.
Would recommend for this time of year -- October - and Halloween.

1085141,2,6305899452,"This made for TV Canadian adaptation of the Washington Irving story is more faithful than the Tim Burton movie. (Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version.",1173225600,3,701,4.616
1085142,2,6305899452,"It's not as bad as the version done by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, but close enough. I did find it intriguing as it started off with a conversation with the author Washington Irving. I love this story, but there were some things brought out here that I wasn't quite ready for, and that was the truth the lovely Katrina actually despised Ichabod, and turned him down for marriage. I guess it's because I can identify with this rejection as I've been rejected before. It also showed a stern Ichabod, and one who tried to show how spiritual he was by singing loudly, and impressively in the church to the point where he was able to sweet-talk the minister into letting him be choir director, and for what may have been immoral motives. A far cry from the Ichabod that I remember reading about, and hearing about as he had a humble nature about him. I've heard many versions of this story, and some were more memorable than others, but it's a story that you'll never forget, but when it comes to this version I just rather soon forget it. It's a version that just tried to be too truthful, and for those of us who still see the romantic side of Ichabod and Katrina we tend to not want to know that Katrina actually didn't love him at all. At least there was no laughing when the Headless Horseman showed himself.",1161820800,4,1313,4.429752066115703
1085143,5,6305899452,"Sorry, but I strongly disagree with the other reviews here about this version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". Tim Burton's version, whilst midly entertaining, is a travesty of an adaption of the original story by Washington Irving. As a historian, I highly recommend this version, given it's faithfulness to the original story, and it's overall authentic portrayal of life in 1790's America. There are a few details that they get wrong, such as Squire Van Tassel's statement that the Battle of Sleepy Hollow was in 1774, a year before the Revolution began, but overall, someone did some research for this version. The costumes, material culture displayed, the portrayal of the Dutch ""Yorkers"" and their contempt for ""Yankees"" and taxes -- I would use this in my history class.

In short, if ""it ain't broke, don't fix it"".

Burton's version is just another historical, inauthentic and inaccurate mess that history teachers, librarians and museum folks have to clean up.

This one is on my shelf, right next to ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"", another classic of American folklore and literature.",1153699200,53,1096,5.0777777777777775
1085144,2,6305899452,"Read S. Medeiros's review below.  I don't mind saying s/he pretty much nailed it.  I had to watch this movie in installments because I just couldn't sit there for the entire duration.  Tim Burton's version has its own share of problems, the biggest being making Washington Irving's tale pretty much an action/adventure movie that is seriously lacking in script writing -- as other reviewers have said.  Still, Burton's effort is a long way better than Hallmark's.  I really didn't feel a thing with this movie, not fear, not wonder, not delighted or tickled.  Maybe just relieved when it was over.  Indeed, the Headless Horseman was pretty much laughable, and only appeared at the very end.  You almost felt lucky though that you hadn't seen him earlier because he was just as daft as Brent Carver's Ichabod.

That is, contrary to S. Medeiros, I was not especially impressed with Brent Carver's portrayal.  Maybe it was indeed the Ichabod from the novel to a tee.  However, if that's the case maybe Burton had it at least partly right when he adapted Ichabod to be one that the viewer can have at least the remotest affinity with -- perhaps the difference between something you are to read and something you are to watch, I'm not sure.

Watch it if you catch it on TV, and you're a big fan of the tale.  Otherwise, really, do yourself a favour and stay away.  And I say this as a big fan of the tale, and it does pain me to be critical of C-grade actors that are trying so hard and truly have more acting skill than I would ever have if I were to study drama for 10 years.  That said, again, this movie is just not fun.  You don't feel glad to have watched it despite its flaws, as sometimes happens.",1129593600,2,1700,4.470779220779221
1085145,1,6305899452,"The Hallmark version is not faithful to Washington Irving's text.

1085146,3,6305899452,"This version is pretty much what author Washington Irving had originally written. It is the exact opposite of the Tim Burton film. This film, while niely made, looks and feels like a cheap PBS production. It's great fun for families, that's for sure, but far from being a classic or gripping. I think, after seeing Burton's film, we sorta want that gothic horror film feel that he created. Not here. What this is is a faithful adaption of Irving's story. I love the story and every shape and form it comes in, but I prefer Tim Burton. Still, a very faithful adaption of the story.",1000339200,4,580,4.533333333333333

1085203,5,6305899452,"I absolutely loved this rendition!  I have viewed other versions as well, such as the one starring Jeff Goldblum, and none of them strike a chord so true to the original story as this.  The atmosphere retains that gentle pulse of American lore that has been so endearing to Irving's readers throughout the years, while casting a perfect Ichabod Crane.  Brent Carver's interpretation of the character is on point, while his costars, though not of the same caliber of acting, complement his role superbly.  It is humorous, brilliantly executed, and manages to include a fair amount of new interpretation while still remaining faithful to the tale.  I highly recommend it!",1369180800,,669,5.045454545454546

1085205,5,6305899452,"I have to admit. I do love sleepy Hollow by Tim Burton. But, I still favor this version which is very close to how it was written. I loved the book so much that I decided, two years ago, on my 40th Birthday, to make a trip to Tarrytown, NY, sleepy hollow & learn it's history of that time period & the book. I even walked the trail that icabod took when he was running from the horseman. I loved it so much that now I make a trip there every October. It's my birthday month & of course Halloween season (which is the best time to go there) The reason for that little story is that this movie version really gives you the feel of that time period & the people that lived it! I find myslf reading the book & watching this movie every Halloween season. People should not even compare this to Tim Burton's version. His movie is called ""Sleepy Hollow"" NOT ""the Legend of sleepy Hollow"" He based it on the book. That's all! I love both movies. If you're looking for more action, suspence & a little gore, by all means, buy ""Sleepy Hollow"" by Tim Burton. If you're looking to watch a nice family movie based on the facts of the book, get this movie! Only the very ending is a little different from the book, but all & all it still holds true. Never try to fix a classic! For those of you who have only seen both versions of the movie, READ THE BOOK! & then watch this movie. You will then know why so many people love it!",1314144000,5,1414,4.108303249097473
1085206,5,6305899452,"I rented this movie from ""NetFlix"", during the Halloween season, and we really enjoyed it. So, we decided to add it to our ""Halloween movie/cartoon collection"", than after I purchased it, here on Amazon, I received word in two days, from Amazon, that the seller had cancelled my order.(I've had this happen before, especially after a movie has ""gone out of print"", and the sellers start to raise the price on the ""out of Print"" DVD's). It was than that I noticed that both the sellers on Amazon & Half.com began to sell this little gem had these ridiculous high prices, ranging anywhere from the high ""seventies"" to even ""$96.00"" on Half.com!!! What in the world is going on!?!?!? No tape or DVD is worth all that much money!

Though this is a wonderful little gem of a movie, it's not worth any of those ""high"" prices. I have tried to find out if it has gone ""out of print"", but to no avail. Though, why would it be ""out of print"" as people like, and enjoy, watching it during the Halloween season.

Concerning the movie, itself, it has been done, true to the period which it portrays.

Ichabod Crane is not very likeable and by the end of the film you are anxiously awaiting the Headless Horseman.  Brahm Bones is portrayed as a very likeable fellow which is a contrast of other versions of the legend.  The ending was a bit of a let down, but overall the movie is worth a watch.

Just because there aren't any drop-dead gorgeous A-list movie stars, tons of computer generated graphics or blood & guts---they think it's ""boring?"" Unbelievable. The headless horseman takes some imagination, the legend is to play tricks on your head as you walk through the woods alone at night ... this movie is SUPERB and stays true to Irving's tale of small-town superstition and the quirky character in Ichabod Crane.",1243555200,4,478,5.063291139240507
1085222,4,6305899452,"I'm a great fan of Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. However, I'm also familiar with the original story by Washington Irving and aware that the Burton movie took many liberties with the plot.

In ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" [1999], the story remains for the most part faithful to the original story, and has Brent Carver playing the title role of bumbling, ambitious schoolmaster Ichabod Crane. He is perfect in this role and I truly felt entertained by his eccentricities and clumsy gestures. His object of affection, the wealthy farmer's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel is ably portrayed by the pretty Rachelle Lefevre, who plays an intelligent young woman with dreams of travelling the world. Paul Lemelin plays Abraham Bones, the impoverished farmer who loves Katrina yet is frustrated by her reluctance to leave her parents for a new life elsewhere. As the story is stretched to about 1.5 hrs in length, the main focus of the story is the love' triangle' between Ichabod, Katrina and Abraham.

I felt the movie dragged in some parts, possibly because the director felt certain scenes were necessary to 'pad' the story. It's difficult when the source story itself is just a short story, hence the resort to padding the storyline whilst staying faithful to the essence of the story.

""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is a family-friendly movie as there are no gory parts [unlike Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" which had truly scary parts and some disturbing themes] and the language is ""clean"". This makes a great Halloween movie for the family, and will also appeal to fans of Irving's short story.",1242259200,,1629,4.981617647058823

1085226,5,6305899452,"I like this version of Sleepy Hollow very much.  This one was true to the original Washington Irving and paid much attention to detail.  Brent Carver was convincing as the bumbling Ichabod Crane, and the other main characters were appealing as well. Rachelle Lefevre and Paul Lemelin has chemistry and were beautiful together as a young couple.  Not to mention that Paul Lemlin is very good looking. Anyway, this version has no outstanding special effects and Hollywood nonsense, and does not go on for two and a half hours with some far-fetched story line just to draw in the crowds. It is the classic story just how I remember it from when I was a little girl.  This will always be my favorite Halloween story and I believe they did it justice.  Otherwise I wouldn't purchase it!",1224547200,3,781,4.671532846715328
1085227,5,6305899452,"I recently watched The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and give it a 5 star rating.

I grew up just North of Tarrytown, NY where Sleepy Hollow is located. In the Fall The Hollow is often shrouded in fog in early mornings and early evenings. The area, which extends along the Hudson River, lends itself to imaginings of ghosts and goblins, which the early Dutch were very good at doing: The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Rip Van Winkle, as well as other stories put down in writing by Washington Irving.

I grew up with these stories and look forward to hearing or seeing them again at this time of year. I have also passed the tradition along to my children.

I think I have seen and heard just about every adaptation from Ed Begley's re-telling of the story on tape, reading it from an old printing of the story, and, of course, Disney's cartoon version.

I think this adaptation is the best I have seen. It captures the mysterious and haunting feeling of the region in Fall, the looks, traditions, dress, and speech of the early Dutch settlers, and the story as it was told to Washington Irving.

Tim Burton's movie Sleepy Hollow is a good film for what it is, but it is not an accurate re-telling of the classic.

Sincerely,

Maureen Kearney",1223510400,8,1231,4.493273542600897
1085228,1,6305899452,"Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed with this movie.  The movie was EXTREMELY boring and although the character of Ichabod Crane was more in keeping with Washington Irving's story, the movie as a whole lacked any real life (no pun intended).  The Disney cartoon was far more entertaining and a lot scarier too.  The characterization of Brom Van Brunt is totally innacurate as he is supposed to be a ""roughian"".  The portrayal of this role turned him into an overall nice guy and the actor was too much of a pretty boy to portray Brom Bones anyway.  Brom Bones was a lot more likeable than Ichabod in this movie.

In terms of pace and suspense, this is at the  opposite spectrum of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow.  Although I think Tim Burton totally Burtonized Sleepy Hollow completely and went to the extreme, at least ""Sleepy Hollow"" kept the audience's attention.  I agree that it had way too much gore and Burton also rewrote the entire mythology (Blasphemy). The soundtrack for this movie was absolutely AWFUL too.  Danny Elfman's Sleepy Hollow score (I recommend it) was an absolute masterpiece compared to this.  Also, in this movie the Headless Horseman shows up for all about 1 minute and does NOTHING except scare Ichabod as he tries to put a pumpkin where his head should be and then vanishes... YAAAAAAWN

The historical accuracy of this movie was flawed too and unfortunately the writers felt the need to change the history of the Battle of White Plains (which they renamed also) and said that not only did the Colonials drive the British away, but the Headless Horseman helped them do it in exchange for a bag of gold coins.  FYI:  The Battle of White Plains was a DEFEAT, BUT because General Howe let Washington withdraw, they regrouped and shortly thereafter won their first decisive victory against the British that turned the course of the Revolutionary War.

If you are looking for a movie of Sleepy Hollow that you can show at an elementary school to first or second graders and fill 90 minutes of time look no further.  If you want to have an entertaining movie, that is historically accurate, is as spooky as the Legend of Sleepy Hollow should be, AND will keep your attention, THIS ISN'T IT.  In fact there isn't one... YET

I wish somebody would make a ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" movie that is in keeping with Washington Irving's vision, historically accurate, but still has an interesting plot, suspense, and has more of the Headless Horseman in it.  Maybe I should write one myself.  Hmmmmm...",1216166400,10,2517,4.76905311778291
1085229,3,6305899452,"If there is one good thing about this made-for-TV ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (produced by Canadian company Muse Entertainment and presented by Hallmark Entertainment), it is Brent Carver and his authentic portrayal of Ichabod Crane. From the very first moment when he appears on the deserted hill standing still like a scarecrow, Brent Carver becomes Ichabod Crane, lanky schoolmaster who has just arrived in secluded Sleepy Hollow.

This Muse/Hallmark version is more faithful to Washington Irving's original short story than Tim Burton's Gothic horror adaptation. Probably some viewers would welcome the film's faithfulness while others might complain for the same reason. Though the production designs are convincing and photography is decent, the flat storytelling about the fate of hapless Ichabod and his romance is rather dull, lacking mood and nuance. Scenes of Headless Horseman are acceptable, but not outstanding.

After watching Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod, you may find the snobbish character of Ichabod a little off-putting at first, but Carver's fine performance and his nice comic touch makes him very human just like the counterpart in Irving's original. I think Katrina Van Tassel by Rachelle Lefevre is just OK, but sadly Paul Lemelin, who plays Brom Bones, is awfully miscast. He just doesn't look like the character from Irving's book and his acting needs much improvement.

You may show this TV version in class (no beheading is included), but students might find it boring. Not a totally bad adaptation, but still uninspired, except Carver's superb performance as Ichabod Crane.",1203724800,16,1613,5.418326693227091

I have read the story by Washington Irving several time, and this follows the story very close. Because the original story was a short story, this movie has dialogue and situations that could have happened in the reader's mind, but were only briefly alluded to in the story. However, this adaptation was very well acted, and the scenery was New England in fall, what more could one ask for? One thing I will say, is this is more of a love story, than a horror story, which is true to the book. If you want blood and gore, then you will be very disappointed. This movie is rated NR, however it could easily be rated PG. Perhaps even G, except for the legendary chase scene at the end of the movie which might frighten a small child. There is no foul language, nudity or sexual innuendos. This is a good, clean, very entertaining picture that, in my opinion, is perfect for the whole family. The end of the book does mention a possible Ichabod sighting, which could explain his whereabouts that this version doesn't allow for.
