8633187,2,B00HK5QSG8,"Puerile soap opera that tries to pass as conscious cinema (and flunks). Many stale platitudes and mantras retell the politically-correct version about the Tlatelolco massacre, but the movie is worth seeing for its above-average production. 1968 Mexico City is recreated up to the last detail, including Olympic Games stewardess uniforms, old Orange Crush bottles, and  those now-extinct Borward cars public officials used to drive back then. Unfortunately, Mexican Cinema lacks the resources for sophisticated CGI's to recreate Tlatelolco Square as it looked in those days, but the producers did walk the extra mile to bring back the city of my childhood -perhaps the only reason I endured the entire flick.

Roberto Sosa and Ricardo Kleinbaum, though, make outstanding performances as President Gustavo Daz Ordaz and Secretary Luis Echeverra, his second-in-command and successor. It's not every day you see recent Mexican presidents depicted as villains in Mexican movies.",1430784000,,973,5.612244897959184
8633188,5,B00HK5QSG8,"This is an excellent film that follows the life of two college students - of two different social classes - throughout the whole university movement in Mexico in 1968 that culminated in the massacre at Tlatelolco.  This film really makes you feel like you were there.

I do believe they could have gone a bit more into the ""pliegue petitorio"" that was at the center of the whole conflict (or WAS it at the center of the whole conflict?  perhaps not).  That would be my only light criticism.

Highly recommended for anyone interested!  Very relevant in connection to this tragedy that has occurred in Guerrero, Mexico with the 43 university students who, ironically, were on their way to an event commemorating the events of Tlatelolco '68.",1422835200,,739,4.825396825396825
