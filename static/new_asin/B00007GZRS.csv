1810032,5,B00007GZRS,"This picture opened in theaters on August 21 1980 in New York City starring Susan Saint James as Jane, Jane Curtain as Elaine and Jessica Lange as Louise. Jane and Robert waking up in the back of Jane's station wagon. The reason there sleeping in the station wagon is the Jane's kids think that Robert is there Uncle and how do you explaining sleeping with the kids uncle. Jane states to Robert that she wants to talk to him about getting married. Robert replies that he can't get married until old man Willard dies and he gets the store. Meanwhile Louise shows up at here husbands veterinarian office looking for her husband. Louise and Albert have been married for nine years and she needs Albert to write her a check for one thousand dollars for the merchandise that she bought for here antique store. Meanwhile Jane has arrived at her home with bags of clothes that she bought and takes them upstairs to the bedroom. While she starts to undress, she turns on the answering machine where she hears a message from her husband. On the machine is her husband trying to explain to her that he's leaving her. Elaine goes to the closet to find his things gone so she smashes the machine and throws her wedding ring outside. Elaine goes to the bank and finds out that her husband beat her there, by cleaning out there account selling all her jewelry and leaving Elaine with just $480.00 dollars in her Christmas fund. The next day Albert is in his office with the IRS and after going over his books, Albert is told that the IRS owes him $11.19. However, the IRS wants to know about the 36,000 dollars that he gave Louise for her antique store. Albert states the antique store is a business but the IRS states that it's a hobby so now unless Albert can prove it's a business he will owe the IRS taxes on the $36,000 plus penalties. Meanwhile Jane's ex comes to pickup the kids and she hits him up for more child support in which her ex replies that he can't. Meanwhile after having a few drinks at the local tavern Elaine gets into car to leave. She pulls out crossing lanes and then goes right through a stop sign. Sitting at that stop sign is a police officer who turns his lights on and goes after her and finally pulling her over. Elaine is talking to the officer and finds out that he's married. So Elaine starts hitting the officer with her purse and the officers tells her that if she hits him once more he'll arrest her. She states that if he does the first phone call she makes will bee to his wife. Now some thoughts of my own on this movie. I love this movie because it caught my attention through the entire picture. I give Jane Curtin 6 stars because she wasn't bad in her movie debut. I thought that Jessica Lange was even better in her role as the doctor's wife. However, I bought this movie for two reasons. The first was Susan Saint James who looked great in jeans and everything else she wore. The second reason, Sybil Danning who was Albert receptionist and was excellent at it. Because of those two reasons, I give this movie 10 weasel stars.",1233014400,2,3057,4.412389380530973
1810033,4,B00007GZRS,"Since 1976, when I was a small kid until now, I've lived in Eugene, Oregon on and off. For some reason back in the early '80s I was not made aware of How to Beat the High Cost of Living. I think a lot of reasons for that was another movie filmed in Eugene back in 1978 was much more successful and received much more attention, I'm referring to National Lampoon's Animal House. And I would have imagined seeing this film on television back in the 1980s, but I never did.

This is a great little time capsule from 1980 (actually 1979, it was filmed in 1979, not released until mid 1980), showing places like the Valley River Center (the mall the movie was set) and other places were like before they were remodeled beyond recognition. Seeing the interior of Valley River Center really took me back since me and my family would go there from time to time back then (back in 1980, me and my family lived within walking distance from Valley River Center, thanks to a bicycle footbridge crossing the Willamette River to VRC). The movie proudly shows the Meier & Frank (complete with that late '60s logo and rotunda - you have to bear in mind Valley River Center opened up in 1969, and so did its Meier & Frank), as well as all the other (real) shops that existed in Valley River Center at the time. I was a bit bewildered why they didn't show the Montgomery Ward's, which was opposite from Fredrick & Nelson. Outside of Valley River Center, there's a scene at an Albertson's, a store I've been in personally, at that time, and still go to now (although, like most everything else, remodeled and expanded beyond recognition since), and Taco Time, a taco joint (not unlike Taco Bell) that was established here in Eugene. There's even a scene at Skinner's Butte at night. I can go on about the changes since (how the mall and those establishments went through many remodels), but I have to say that How to Beat the High Cost of Living is just about the only Hollywood movie that I have personally visited many of those locations that were filmed, and had so even just very recently, even if they're now practically unrecognizable from the film. Not to mention that by 2006 the Meier & Frank was no more, replaced by an already existing Macy's (since the May Co. which owned Meier & Frank since 1966, was bought out by Federated Department Stores, and they decided to change all the stores they bought out into Macy's). At least I was happy that the Valley River Center's Meier & Frank kept the old logo and old look right until its early 2006 demise.

Most of the film is quite accurate of Eugene, although there's one scene where Jane Curtin gets pulled over by Dabney Coleman for running a stop sign, it occurred at Main St. Now, unless she happened to wander off to neighboring Springfield, there is no Main St. in Eugene (Main Street in Springfield heads from downtown eastward out of town off Hwy. 126).

The movie consists of three ladies, Jane Curtin, Susan St. James, and Jessica Lange who, due to divorce and poor business decisions, leaves them bankrupt and desperate. So you have to watch this film to see what happens next. Just that I tell you involves a money ball in the middle of Valley River Center.

I don't claim it to be the greatest movie out there, and I can do without some of the acting, but I still like it. Plus it's set in a town I live in, where I have personally been to many of the locations the film were shot at (though I never personally witnessed the film being shot). I am so happy they didn't use Eugene as a backdrop, and then use Hollywood locations with totally fictitious landmarks and businesses, this is the real Eugene in and out, at least as it was in 1980.

If you're a Eugene native, and have lived here as long as I have, you owe it to yourself to check out this film. If you're new to Eugene, then seen this film, you're looking at Eugene as it was at the end of the '70s/turn of the '80s.",1207267200,5,3929,4.40633608815427
1810034,5,B00007GZRS,"This overlooked comedy from 1980 was shot in 1979 and is really a 70s styled movie. You really root for these three  suburban woman, all of whom have been screwed over by men, as they fight against the economic climate of the late 1970s. Its great for seeing the sometimes ugly styles of the time, especially the shopping mall. Evidently shot on location in Eugene Oregon, featuring a great jazz score by Patrick Williams (Hubert Laws on flute), this movie shows that in the 1970s they didn't just make movies about teens but instead average women trying to cope with daily life with wit and grit.",1198886400,2,597,4.632075471698113
1810035,5,B00007GZRS,"This movie is fun, different.  I have liked since the very first time I saw it on HBO all those years ago.  I haven't seen it in a long time and am thrilled to find it again. Total entertainment.  Love this.  Donna",1187913600,4,214,4.023809523809524
1810036,4,B00007GZRS,"I remember seeing this in the theaters as a kid way back in 1980 (OK, now I officially feel OLD!)...anyway, this is a small, slight, yet hysterically funny and very smart comedy that somehow has fallen off the radar for most audiences - similar to Dolly, Jane, and Lily in ""9 to 5,"" Jane, Jessica, and Susan make a terrific trio of would-be thieves trying to steal a load of cash from the ""money ball"" in a Pacific Northwest Mall.  With cameos from Fred Willard, Eddie Albert, Richard Benjamin, and Dabney Coleman, the entire cast, the screenplay, the direction, and the tacky details of late 70s/early 80s middle-class America are all dead-on hilarious!  If they can go ahead and ruin ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" by doing a remake, why hasn't anyone thought of remaking this underrated comedic gem? Seriously, if you love light, frothy, yet still-topical comedies, give HOW TO BEAT a whirl!",1142035200,12,888,4.759740259740259
1810037,4,B00007GZRS,"Although the details are dated, _How To Beat The High Co$t Of Living_ is freshly topical, with the economy in a bad way again.  The three heroines' problems are, IMO, partly their own fault---but one has to root for their spunky, ingenious heist.
Jane Curtin improvising a striptease to cover her chums' getaway is a real highlight of the disc.  She's game, sexy, and believable in her role---a really talented actress.  And, for the record, the power is cut off only in _part_ of the mall, not the whole thing---I saw a review of the movie when it came out that didn't understand this point.",1047168000,5,592,4.619047619047619
1810038,4,B00007GZRS,"I can't believe this is finally coming to DVD!!  I taped it a couple of years ago off of cable, have loved this movie since I saw it in a theater when I was 18.
I skim Amazon.com all the time, looking to see what's coming out on DVD, and nearly jumped out of my seat when I saw this - if you like ""9 to 5"" and movies like it, this is a gem!  Susan St. James, Jessie Lange, and Jane Curtin play women desperate for money for one reason or another - St. James wants to get married to her boyfriend and become respectable; Lange needs the money to keep her from losing her shop, a business that's been steadily losing money that her husband bought for her but now has to get rid of or he's in tax trouble; and Curtin is a divorcee just trying to survive.
The three women, struggling to beat the high cost of living, come across a brilliant idea - their local mall is having a contest, a huge plastic ball in the center of the mall will be filled with money, and you have to figure how much is in it.  What the ladies come up with is a plan to enter to ball from underneath, cut through it and use a vacuum cleaner hose to suck out a good chunk of the money out for themelves.
The planning and execution of this caper - using only what resources the ladies can muster up on their own (which includes getting the tools for their crime by stealing them from St. James's boyfriend's hardware store, in a hilarious scene where the kids come along for the ride because St. James's character couldn't get a babysitter) - does not exactly go smoothly.
Of course in this movie, as in ""9 to 5"" and others like it, the execution of the crime does NOT come off without its share of glitches.  But wow, is it fun to watch, enjoyable and light entertainment that will put a smile on your face long after you've seen it, just thinking about your favorite scenes.",1042588800,32,1844,4.1568627450980395
1810039,4,B00007GZRS,"...The movie includes Jane Curtin, Susan St. James, and Jessica Lange who are feeling the crunch of the cost of living getting higher, while their paychecks stay the same.  They notice a promotion at the mall which is holding Thousands of dollars and plan to steal the money.  Very entertaining to watch how they plan to pull it off.  The movie was first released in 1980, but you could easily remake the movie again today, as once again the high cost of living keeps on rising.",1039996800,4,478,4.534883720930233

Jane Curtin hatches the scheme but the more logical Jessica Lange is the step by step planner.  There are funny stories attached to each women's financial needs.  Eddie Albert as Saint James father has some good moments and Dabney Coleman as Curtin's love ineterest is a policeman who is blinded by his honest love for her.  Richard Benjamin as Lange's Vetenarian husband almost steals the show. This is a feel good movie.,1420761600,3,526,4.494736842105263

1810093,5,B00007GZRS,"I owned a VHS copy I taped from a free weekend of HBO 25+  years ago. I kept waiting for this to come onto streaming to get a clear, full copy. This is Jane Curtin, Susan St. James and Jessica Lange as young women trying to stay afloat in the days of high inflation and gas rationing of 1979. How to get more money? Steal it! From testing themselves by stealing from a grocery store and not being noticed to planning their moves by moving fridge magnets shaped like veggies, this is pure comedy without gratuitous swearing or violence. Richard Benjamin is continually trying to get his wife into bed. Garrett Morris has a cameo appearance as a powerful company employee who has heard all the excuses. Jane Curtain does a strip tease when plans go wrong! If you never saw Saturday Night Live before John Belushi died and wonder what his co-stars were like, rent this one.

Again, it surprisingly holds up after all this time, not everything does, but despite the change in gas prices and interest rates some things like financial woes never go out of style.

It avoids being too light like a forgettable TV movie or too dark so that it makes you uncomfortable. There's one amazing assemblage of talented familiar faces such as Richard Benjamin, Cathryn Damon, Ronnie Schell, Dabney Coleman, Susan Tolsky, Sybil Danning, Garrett Morris, Eddie Albert and Fred Willard.

The plot's implausible, sure, but it makes for great comedy--and as another reviewer stated, it certainly resonates with the state of today's economy. Lots of great one-liners and for such an implausible plot, due to the skill of the actors it really doesn't seem as outlandish. A classic, in my book!",1363478400,,564,4.53921568627451

1810140,4,B00007GZRS,"St. James, Lange, & Curtain co-star as 3 ladies who find themselves looking for a way to survive in the tough economic times of the late 1970's. Their solution? Steal a cash jackpot from a shopping mall's ""guess how much money"" contest.  And, oh yeah, the money is being displayed for all to see in the center of the mall in a giant glass ball.  (Insert comic hijinks here.) From their criminal practice runs to see if they really have the guts to commit a crime to their less than perfect attempts to get away with the cash, this movie is great fun. You'll find yourself rooting for these characters to steal the dough and make their getaway. There's not a lot of substance here but that's what makes it so enjoyable. Can't wait until my copy arrives!",1253577600,2,752,4.442028985507246

7976426,5,B00007GZRS,"I love this movie, it brings back memories of the times. In mid seventies I remember that's when ""Uncle Sam"" saw 2 people working and were able to afford, RV's ect... and it became hard to live on a 1 income family, so in essence the prices of everything went up, and 2 people had to work, and
the unfortunate thing is the ""children"", because they had to be looked after by baby-sitters or preschools. So for me it's kinda like a milestone movie for the times.",1522281600,,460,4.2988505747126435

7976429,2,B00007GZRS,"Wow i remember this movie from when i was younger.  great movie, so when i saw i could get this on DVD i thought why not.  when i received the movie i played it.  what a blast from the past love it until i got to the middle of the movie when it locked up.  it would not play.  I tried to fast forward it to the next section, would not work.  Tried to rewind back a frame and it did but seemed it would play to the same place in the movie and lock up.  Tried to see if it would play if i fast forward to section 9 to finish the movie and it would not work.  I tried to contact Amazon about this but the only email listed does not work,  so i guess i have to eat it as it was opened and i can't get ahold of anyone at amazon to discuss the problem.",1509235200,,746,3.641509433962264
7976430,1,B00007GZRS,Took delivery of DVD and attempted to play it on a Sony Bluray / DVD player...experienced DVD freeze about chapter five or six. I restarted my player thinking it was the player...same issue. Checked disk...not dirty or scratched. Attempted to play on a different DVD player and it stopped at same point. Attempted playback on computer DVD player and it skips and freezes...random....not sure what the problem is...but it is being sent back to Amazon for refund. All DVD players are less than two year old! Don't buy this!,1508630400,,521,4.865168539325842

7976432,5,B00007GZRS,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. love finding good older movies on dvd.,1505174400,,83,4.25
7976433,5,B00007GZRS,"I bought the dvd version of this movie instead of the Blu-Ray because the studio didn't do any restoration work to the old prints used for making this DVD. Typically, older movies like this don't look good on Blu-ray unless they have been restored. That being said, I think the picture and audio quality are quite good for a movie this old. The movie itself is fantastic, and although it hasn't aged particularly well, I still think it is a great movie.",1504310400,,453,4.536585365853658
