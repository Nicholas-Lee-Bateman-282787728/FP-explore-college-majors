8451820,3,B00068S3T6,This movie is a good example of how fishing for tuna was done in South Australia.  Nowadays the tuna is held in floating pens off the coast.  This film can be slow in places but if you are interested in the old style of fishing with steel sqid jigs then you might enjoy it.  More of a rent for the night film.,1141257600,5,309,3.9516129032258065
