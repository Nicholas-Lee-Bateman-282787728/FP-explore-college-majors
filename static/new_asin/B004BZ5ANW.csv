4320749,1,B004BZ5ANW,"This movie cannot be considered horror by any deffinition unless you count torture.  The production quality looks like it was shot by community college film class.  The acting is beyond bad and honestly I feel bad for the actors for even taking part in this movie.  The murder scenes are a bad ""attempt"" and I want to emphasize ""attempt"" at being gory.  There is a lot of blood but no actual visible wounds on any of the victims.  One of the first victims can even be seen breathing after he is supposed to be dead, although he really just looks like he was covered in red liquid because not even his clothes had damage from the axe that had supposedly chopped him to death.
How I managed to sit through this abomination is beyond my comprehension but I have to say at the end I wished I had been one of the murder victims to put me out of my misery.  If any of the cast or crew read this review please take my advice and leave acting to the professionals and go back to working behind the counter of a fast food joint.",1300492800,22,1019,4.22680412371134

I recently saw a 1.9/10 rating for this movie, but I don't think the people rating this movie understood its purpose from a source like Amazon Prime. If you're cleaning around the house, doing homework, etc., this is a really great film to be playing (in the background, and even to just watch) if you're into the camp horror genre; that's why I was thinking of 4 stars originally. There are movies that have received rave reviews with acting no better then what's in Alice in Murderland; e.g., most of the movies in the Star Wars series.",1450828800,,681,4.3700787401574805

4320771,4,B004BZ5ANW,"So here's the thing, anyone who goes into this movie expecting anything other than a super low budget, poorly acted horror film, has obviously ignored a lot of things. Like for one, the title should be more than enough of a hint. Second, seriously, just look at the rating this movie has anywhere. That being said, I will likely watch this movie again a few times. This is one of those movies that it's so hard to hate because it is so bad it's laughable. I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in years. Obviously, this is meant to be a horror/thriller, but if you don't go into it with any expectations and you might find yourself actually enjoying this for all the wrong reasons.",1433289600,3,682,4.420634920634921

I like watching movies like this for the shear awe-fullness of the plot, and the acting. Not everyone in here over acts, but you can tell those who are trying too hard. The special effects are just as bad, but cheesy effects are fun sometimes too!

This is one of those movies that you do wonder, why did I start watching this. And when you are done watching it you are like, wow did i really just watch that whole thing. This is why I say that these kinds of movies are what you do when your doing homework, or cleaning, or something where you don't have to watch the whole thing and miss pivotal plot points.",1430352000,,776,4.132450331125828

4320778,2,B004BZ5ANW,"I knew it was a B movie going in but still it was pretty bad. The dialogue comes across like it was the first draft with no revisions at all, some sounds so unnatural it was painful. Acting is typical for this type of movie, but the poor writing makes it worse. It's like they were just counting on the college age girls in skimpy costumes to carry the whole movie, like that's enough for us.... Plot isn't all that bad, and is the ONLY reason for the second star.

Somebody needs a math lesson, but the greatest part is that it has all the worste parts of the genre, junky place, college girls, 21st birthday, pranks gone wrong but totally misses the mark.  I probably wouldn't rent if it wasn't part of Prime but don't regret the viewing, production was better than other B lists think the budget was just non existent.",1423267200,,620,4.517857142857143

4320797,3,B004BZ5ANW,"I've seen much worse.  Acting isn't horrible from everyone.  I'd say the best actress was Alice's burnette friend or the mother.  There was some goofy acting in this though and goofy dialouge, but I've seen so much worse before to the point where it failed across the board.  I was dreading watching this, but being a fan of Alice in Wonderland, decided to give it a chance.  It wasn't all that bad.  It's ok. I'd never watch it again, but it's all right for a first time watch.  To some people it doesn't matter how attractive people are in movies, to others it does, especially in horror movies so for the people that it does matter to:  Half of the girls are attractive the others aren't.  There are some very pretty girls in here to watch for.  As for the dialouge/the story is would have been much better if they would have cut down some of it that just want on and on.  Ordinarily, a movie is much more fast paced than this so they can get all this information in.  This sort of dragged out and just seemed to tell us things we already knew over and over.  Also, instead of the girls having a party they just sit around and whine about each other.  Don't even attempt to try and have a good time.

The fight scenes were laughable in a bad way and so was the very ending.  It just seemed to repeat things we already knew and therefore wasted time we could have been seeing something else played out.  If this would have been more fast paced and even a little more complex it would have been a decent movie.  Good idea, poor execution.",1411084800,3,1539,4.284722222222222

4320801,1,B004BZ5ANW,"Alice in Murderland (Dennis Devine, 2010)

""I have never approved of your selection of young mates, Mallory.""

I will say this right up front: Alice in Murderland, a ridiculous attempt at making a themed slasher film, is one of the single worst movies I have ever actually sat all the way through. It comes in at much less than an hour and a half, but it feels like twice that length. The only reason I'm giving it half a star is that I finished watching it, and it's not patently offensive in its theme or content. It is the rare film that makes me with I had that hour and change of my life back, but Alice in Murderland falls squarely into that category. If you are one of the short-attention-span crowd, I will tell you now that you should flee screaming in terror rather than subjecting yourself to this waste of celluloid. But if you are the type of masochist who insists on knowing why you should flee screaming in terror rather than subjecting yourself to this waste of celluloid, then by all means read on.

Plot: twenty-one years ago, Alice's mother was murdered on her own twenty-first birthday. Now Alice (Fame's Maleria Grady), her own twenty-first birthday approaching, is trying to find something to take her mind off her own mortality. Her sorority sisters plan an Alice in Wonderland-themed twenty-first birthday party to take place at the newly-purchased performance space of Mr. White (Rush Hour's Christopher Senger), uncle of sorority sister Malory (Sawblade's Marlene Mc'Cohen)...which just happens to be the house where Alice's mother was murdered. True to form, once the sorority sisters and Mr. White are not-so-safely ensconced in the space, a serial killer begins preying on the crew.

In short: the script is ludicrous, the acting is terrible across the board, the cinematography (especially the lighting in the indoor scenes, which is most of the movie) is well below the standards of competence, the choreography (in the catfight scene) is laughable... I could go on, but honestly, I can't see a reason to. There is not a single redeeming quality to this movie, and I'm including the fact that the majority of the cast is made up of young, hot women who all got their costumes from the generic-sexy-costume shop. Yes, everything about this movie is so bad I couldn't even concentrate on the hot young things in skimpy outfits. Now that's bad. ",1364342400,4,2373,4.820638820638821

4320803,2,B004BZ5ANW,I cannot believe I made it through the whole movie. This was a very low budget. I should have taken the advice of the other reviews and not wasted my time.,1363564800,,155,4.032258064516129
4320804,1,B004BZ5ANW,"You do not know true pain until you have sat through this entire film. It is absolutely the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. Staring at a blank wall for an hour and a half would be more entertaining, because while it would give you little, it would take away nothing. I feel dirty after watching this movie. Not one scene shot, not one line spoken, not a single cut or edit in this movie was made without the express intent to cause deep mental anguish for the viewer. This is the sort of film they would force Alex DeLarge to watch in order to break his spirit. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. If you are a masochist who despises fun, happiness and the art of filmmaking, maybe you'll get a few moments enjoyment out of this abomination. As for myself, I need to go drink a gallon of bleach to try to wash some of the memories of this experience away.",1363392000,,882,4.194117647058824

I wouldn't pay the price here on amazon to see it, but if you catch it really cheap, it could be worth it for the entertainment!",1322611200,4,407,3.744186046511628
4320806,1,B004BZ5ANW,"First the PRO:
The movie was poorly acted with little inference to the theme suggested. Weak storyline. Horrible effects. A garage movie with a great dvd cover and potential, given the script's (unused) idea. Trust me when I tell you - you shouldn't watch it if you are paid handsomely to do so. An embarrassment to the genre'.
Now the CON:
A maggot in the shape of a disc. It smells when you crack open the case. It ruins your dvd player. Your TV will never recover and will not forgive you for this travesty. If a dvd player could scream in pain, your ears would bleed.
Finally the CONCLUSION:
Even if taken in the light of ""campy"" you would beg for large bears to ravage the camp and rip out your eyes and ears in a primordial act of mercy.",1300579200,29,743,4.276595744680851

I can, and you should consider resisting as well.
