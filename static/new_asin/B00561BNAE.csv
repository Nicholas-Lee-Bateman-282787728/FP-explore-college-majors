4582960,5,B00561BNAE,"I absolutely LOVE Kendra! Her show is amazing and she is absolutely down-to-earth and hilarious! I laugh non-stop while watching her show and can totally relate to her. She is the best! Also, I really enjoy following her and her family through all the ups and downs they encounter, but they just continue to grow stronger with each obstacle. She is an amazing mother to baby Hank. I love watching her with him.

Just met her in person today at her book signing for ""Being Kendra"", and she is the sweetest person in the world!",1317168000,4,525,4.526315789473684
4582961,5,B00561BNAE,"Hi Everyone, I'm a big Kendra fan.
I've only seen half of this dvd set (will explain further down)but what i seen of it i loved =)
I love that Kendra has come into her own & has become the women & mother we see today!!
Season 2 & 3 are sooooo very different to the 1st, its so obvious but somehow i still feel connected to the show. I've read both of Kendra's books which gave me a lot more understanding of the show & why she is & why things are the way that they are. I definitly recommend the books & all seasons of kendra!!!

However, i was not happy with the service i recieved from Amazon during my purchase of this dvd.
I ordered both this & Holly's World, recieved them both in great time only to find that Kendra had 2 copies of the 2nd Disc & no copies of the 3rd Disc =( VERY DISSAPPOINTING. I wrote to Amazon requesting the item be replaced...
Amazon made a replacement order but charged it to my credit card without notifying me, i automatically cancelled the order. I then wrote to Amazon requesting a refund for the cancelled order & a replace ment order free of charge be placed. They told me that no replacement order could be placed without charging my card & that they could not place another order because i had cancelled the original re-order.... hhmmm
So i had to re-order & pay for this dvd 3 times for a replacement to be sent out, only to find it have the same problem, two copies of disc 2 & none for disc 3.
Amazon finally issued all 3 refunds & after 3 weeks my account was back where it should have been. Only for me to be stuck with a perfectly fine copy of Holly's World & 2 dodgy copies of Kendra Season 2&3. Kendra Season 2&3 is released in Australia tomorrow (14th March 2012) I've pre-ordered it & Will be so excited to finally watch the last disc =)",1317081600,,1785,4.158959537572255
4582962,5,B00561BNAE,"Kendra was always my favorite Girl Next Door, and her reality too. The first season of Kendra was funny, and easy going, but I think things got more serious on seasons 2 and three (included in this DVD collection) and I just can say that this is probably the best E! Show.
They don't even have to try to make the show interesting, because if Kendra is on the show it will be good. I hope the DVD has special features like deleted scenes or interviews, because I can't get enough of this show, and Kendra and Hank are so cute together, and looking forward for season 4.
Go Kendra!",1311897600,8,579,4.2727272727272725
4583033,5,B00561BNAE,"I love this series because Kendra doesn't pretend to be someone she's not.  You get to see her and husband Hank Basket work through problems as well as share their obvious love for each other.  They both have a great sense of humor which makes the show fun to watch.  Put your sterotypes aside, watch a few episodes, and you will begin to understand why life is a little richer when Kendra is a part of it.",1383436800,,406,4.246753246753247
4583034,2,B00561BNAE,"as far as reality television, this is pretty bad.  kendra is dumber than a box of rocks and her pro football player husband isn't exactly a rocket scientist.  not sure if this came out before or after the kim kardashian-kris humphries reality show, but they're both extremely similar (a borderline mentally challenged woman paired up with a pro athlete, and we get to watch as HILARITY ENSUES in their daily life).  actually, not really.  no hilarity here.  no enjoyment, either.",1372118400,,479,4.9375
4583035,1,B00561BNAE,"I received this about a week ago and gave it to my fiance for her birthday gift.  Well, we opened it up and started going through it and noticed that we got disc 1, disc 2, and another copy of disc 2!  I just submitted a replacement request, and hopefully the replacement copy will not have the same issue.  Come on Amazon, make it right! (Though I blame the crappy quality control of the manufacturer more than Amazon!)

I will update my rating if/when this gets resolved...",1333756800,,475,4.425287356321839

4583037,1,B00561BNAE,I purchased this dvd to find out third disc was replaced with disc 2. So there is 2 disc #2 instead of having disc #3. What a fail.,1329004800,,131,3.7142857142857144
4583038,5,B00561BNAE,"My little boy loves Kendra, and when we come in he asks to see her.  He does the craziest dance and rolls his eyes as if he's in a trance.  I personally love the show.  She makes me laugh and they both remind me of what it was like to be young, and also my two year old and Little Hank look as if they could be brothers.  I relate to having a small child and trying to work, although my job is not as glamorous.  We who work with our small children are in a very exclusive club.  I can' wait to buy the next one.  This purchase is prompting me to buy Season 1.",1325548800,2,560,3.7758620689655173
4583039,5,B00561BNAE,"Just like Season 1 of Kendra, Seasons 2 and 3 didn't disappoint. There are 3 entire disks of episodes which is nice and the show is always good for a laugh! It's great to just ""have on in the background"" as there isn't much of a plot (it's reality Tv after all!) but always enjoyable. Go Kendra!",1321056000,4,295,4.192982456140351
4583040,5,B00561BNAE,"What could be more significant than saying can't wait to see season 4, I hope that there will be one!",1319414400,,101,4.1
4583041,4,B00561BNAE,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --As Season Two opens, Kendra is quite pregnant, and the season follows her progression right up to the delivery. She and husband Hank Baskett--the Indianapolis Colts star who earned some unfortunate infamy for taking a Super Bowl onside kick to the face--navigate the treacherous waters of gestation, hormonal imbalance, and whipping oneself back into Playboy shape.

We get 540 minutes of this and I could understand if, at first blush, you recoil in horror. But I'm a convert! It's not making my Top Discs of 2011 list or anything, but Kendra has dispensed with the goofy hokum and turned in a surprisingly genuine look at motherhood and the challenges that go with it.

Thumbs up to Kendra Wilkinson for letting the cameras capture her at her most vulnerable and non-airbrushed. She visibly struggles with her appearance, following the birth of the baby, with one episode devoted entirely to her angst over remaining attractive to her husband. Sure the culmination is a charming date night with Hank espousing his love for her, but Kendra is up-front about her insecurities (that she allows the cameras in dressing rooms capturing her nude and semi-bloated is even more jarring!).

Gone is the flighty ""You go, girl!"" corniness that embodied the first season, replaced by an authentic peek behind the make-up and glamour. Literally. Kendra barely wears any make-up. It's a small thing, I know, but anytime a celebrity is willing to let his or her guard down to this level it's noteworthy.

Not all the episodes are grueling treks through a wasteland of complex emotions and post-partum depression. There is still a decent dose of tomfoolery. It just all feels more grown-up.

The DVDs: 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen, Dolby 2.0 stereo, deleted scenes, outtakes, and uncensored versions of each episode.

4583042,5,B00561BNAE,"I'm a HUGE fan of Kendra, the two seasons are about Hank going to football team to football team and Kendra with H4 moving around the country with them. The different places they live and how Kendra handles being a ""NFL"" wife. I love it! I think if you loved the first season then you will fall in love with this one too.",1317945600,,321,4.111111111111111
