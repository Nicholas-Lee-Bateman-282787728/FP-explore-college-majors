Many of the contributors and their forebears are prominent in the Franco-American immigrant community.  Some are no longer with us making this production that much more important as an archive.  I intend to pass on copies of this video to my children and their non-French-Canadian spouses to help them recall and learn, respectively, the routes of our culture in the United States.  As an immigrant nation, it is important that each culture that helped form our American identity keep its marker in that history as a reminder not only of our cultural origins but of how each culture found its footing to become part of the cultural quilt that is America.",1409443200,,756,4.976190476190476
