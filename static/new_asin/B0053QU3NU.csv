8455612,1,B0053QU3NU,"I live in Ireland, and I'm a big fan of Voltron. I was looking for the whole collection and found this one on amazon.com. I was confident about ordering because I TRUSTED the 5 star review given by another user (and I just realized now that the seller and reviewer are the SAME PERSON!!!!! How can a seller review their own product???).

Well, the reason I'm giving this one star is that I'm very disappointed.

Everything is alright with my order apart from the collection one : blue lion! I have shared 4 pictures showing what I have received. Please look at the green lion collection. The content is a booklet with DVDs-set, and that's how it is with other collections (and how it should be!), but this was not the case for the blue lion! First thing that I didn't like is the scratches on the box... yes I'm a collector and care very much about quality and perfection. All boxes were great, why this was was like this??? Now, after I opened the blue lion box, I was in shock. There was a sealed DVD only! It has nothing to do with the rest of the collection. I'm very very very upset! And it's pointless returning this item to the USA because I'll be paying more money than the value of the item, especially if I post it registered (making sure the seller would receive it)...

Now I have to search for the authentic blue lion collection!!! I feel scammed!!

Beware before buying from 1stVideo, and check the pictures to know how your order will REALLY look like.",1334880000,19,1467,4.4222222222222225
