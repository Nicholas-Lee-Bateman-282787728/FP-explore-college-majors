8230891,1,B000Y2Q9O0,"I got several of these little movies for my 2 year old son and my nephew. Firstly, as an adult watching these, the voices are incredibly annoying and the storyline cheap and corny. Be that as it may, many children's movies are not geared for adult enjoyment - I can handle that. Unfortunately, the way they talk and the relationships between the cars is really geared more for teenagers. Cars talking about how hot they are and baby this and baby that - definitely not recommended to anyone. Oh yeah - the graphics are clunky and obviously not a lot of effort put into them.",1222646400,2,574,4.476190476190476
