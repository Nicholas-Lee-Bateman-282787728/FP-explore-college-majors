195949,3,1575233452,"Well, it's not one of the worst action flicks out there. But I was unfortunate to see it thinking it was the original movie I'd gotten my hands on... Bad idea. However, when the series later aired on TV, I started watching, and let me tell you; all that the pilot lacks, the episodes got. Wow! The sharp scripts, the sarcastic sense of humour, the almost absurd characters, the excellent actors (although it's hard to notice in the pilot for some reason), everything about it got me totally hooked. So, basically, my review's purpose is to complain about the fact that the one season the show aired isn't available on DVD. *g* Conclusion: actionscenes with HK written all over them, the inevitable wise-cracking hero played by Sergei who has the perfect smirk for his part, and the delightful cha-cha-sequence (are we sensing Bruce Lee homage here? ;P) all adds up to an entertaining evening... But the series and the (un-dubbed) Hong Kong movie are still much much better.",974764800,,973,4.7976190476190474
195950,2,1575233452,"Although John Woo is listed as the director for this film, one wonders how much involvement he really had.  With the exception of a few action sequences, this has ""made for TV"" written all over it and, in fact, in the US that's where it debuted.  It's a loose remake of his 1991 Hong Kong film and was produced, on the cheap, in Vancouver.  Nicholas Lea, best known for his character Krycek on the X-Files, must have done this between his appearances on that show which, at the time, was also filming in Vancouver.  The DVD case says it's rated ""R"" but it's more along the lines of a ""PG"" film . . . lots of shooting but no blood.  It's not a bad time waster, but it's just not very memorable.  The ending sets it up for a TV series.  This was originally a budget release from Simitar and now A-Pix.  Besides some chapter breaks, the only extra that you get is a single frame of production credits.  I paid just ... for this so I'm not complaining . . . too much.",973987200,,963,4.190217391304348
195951,4,1575233452,"Okay, so it's not the usual JW fare. On the other hand, it IS a fun, light  action-comedy with aesthetic leads and some good lines. Heat and tension  run throughout, as do enough stunts to keep me interested. I totally  enjoyed it, and came back for more. It won't provide DVD-esque blood  splattering over the screen, but then, if that's all you're after, why  bother reading this far?",969235200,3,386,4.617647058823529
195952,2,1575233452,The original movie under the same name was made back in Hong Kong  in 1991 staring Chow-Yun-Fat and directed by John Woo. That was a good movie depending on if you can understand the chinese language or you can get it  subtitled or dubbed but like always they make the dubbing sound like  garbage. Anyway this sorry remake of a good movie has cheap acting and the  movie overall itself I just didn't like. If you have seen the original then  you may understand what I'm talking about. Its basically a low budget  remake to try and bring in extra money. Spend your hard earned money  somewhere else.,964137600,,598,4.481481481481482
195953,2,1575233452,"The original ""Once a Thief"" was a movie starring Chow-Yun Fat back in 1991 directed by John Woo.  It was a wonderful movie and at the time ""Face Off"" and John Woo's name started to become popular in  the US (not just among HK movie buffs), the TV networks wanted a John Woo  movie they can show on television.
Of course, NBC couldn't show the HK  movies, so they redid the film with one notable HK actor, Michael Wong,  Ivan Sergei known for his TV appearances, Sandrine Holt known for her UK  films, Jennifer Dale who has done many movies but notably known for her  voice on X-Men: The Animated Series and Nicholas Lea known for his work on  X-Files.
Will, I'm sure anyone would jump in a chance to star in a John  Woo movie but since this was made for television, you are not going to see  the typical John Woo magic.  No million bullet shots or blood.
The movie  was definitely thinned out when it came to John Woo's violence.  No  particular attention to sounds such as the gun clicks but it did have a few  usual slow motion scenes that he's known for.
Of course, I recommend the  1991 version but those of us who watched this on television were either  hardcore John Woo fans, curious or first-time John Woo viewers or someone  who had nothing to watch that night.
I purchased this DVD because it is  lower priced than most DVD's and I'm a John Woo fan. Also, the movie has  this ""Director's Cut"" logo on the top and it's rated  R.
OK...I may not remember the TV version but what was the director's  cut...I don't know.  Why this got ""Rated R"" on it, I don't know  because there is hardly any blood.  Oh, well...there is violence (ala  people shooting at each other) but wasn't that on TV?  Maybe that's what  was cut from TV...I don't know. The video is pan & scan and the sound  is not 5.1 of course.  As for the extra's, there are none.  Movie  factoids...change that to ""factoid"".  Just one page mentioning  the cast, directed by John Woo and that's it. Pretty much what you should  expect is the typical movie of the night on DVD but in this case, directed  by John Woo.
You really have to be a John Woo fan to buy this DVD.  Otherwise, this DVD is not recommended.",959472000,6,2176,4.310173697270471

195974,3,1575233452,"Re-made for Canadian television, this movie did have potential.  It's got a lot of creativity, and some action-flick humor...but the chemistry between actors felt unnatural--too forced.  And worst of all, Michael Wong was cast into a leading role.  This dude CANNOT act.  He should change his name to Monotone Wong (or Wong Daan-Diu in Cantonese).",1106524800,,347,5.254545454545455

195980,4,1575233452,"I've watch original HongKong version, and I met this Canada version. oh, my god, it's so wonderful! Actually, this version has no connection with HongKong one. But who CARES? It's funny, weird, stunned, and amusing. Maybe some people think only fantastic ""Broken Arrow"", ""Face/Off"", ""Mi-2"".. and disappoint with Canada version ""Once a Thief"". Hey, Woo has also 'comic reliefs'. All characters are so fascinating, and makes me laugh. Vic is so adorable, Li Ann is attractive, Mac is cute, and the director over-whelms everybody - include me who watching. They make 'chemical reaction' ever I seen. Oh, don't forget - after you watch this movie, you should see TV series ""once a thief"". It presents you almost weird fun.",979776000,3,718,5.042016806722689
195981,2,1575233452,"I thought I was purchasing the original movie when I bought this. Wow, was I disappointed! I haven't felt this ripped-off since I was a kid and bought the Ronco amazing cocktail glass chiller. There are some funny lines, but not a drop of blood and it really irks me when people are constantly beating each other up and don't have a single mark on their face after getting smacked. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this piece of junk thinking it was the real thing. I don't know how Woo sleeps at night knowing that he lent his name to this. It even has his name as director right on the back cover, but obviously it is not. I lost a lot of respect for Woo after this one. Anyway, don't waste your time.",979344000,,712,4.166666666666667

7798863,5,1575233452,"""Once a Thief"" (1965) was based on a good novel by Zekial Marko who wrote the screenplay and was even given an important part in the film.  It told of the ambience of the time, the drugs and jazz and crime element, and although possibly considered dated today (there was even a different same titled John Woo movie more recently (1991)), then it was bold and daring.  Ann-Margret, at the height of her day as a sex kitten, was attempting to stretch her acting skills I'm sure and terribly overacts and her co-star, Alain Delon handles her expertly, but I don't see how the director, Ralph Nelson, let her get away with such histrionics.  Ralph Nelson, in a short documentary ""The Background Beat"" also included on the disc on the music by Lalo Schifrin, was a very competent director.  He directed Sidney Poitier in ""Lilies of the Field"" and also ""Soldier in the Rain"" and ""Father Goose"" to name a few.  It's rare that Warner Archive include extras as you are lucky to sometimes get a trailer which they also include here.  The documentary is both interesting and informative.  The film is in black and white which heightens the sense of doom to it all, with great cinematography by Robert Burks.  The film also features some great performances by Jack Palance and Van Heflin with Tony Musante.  It was exciting in its day and still packs a wallop.

I don't know if this is meant to be a serious movie, but if you need a good laugh, go for it.  It's got action, a botched up love story, and some good old fashioned goof balls.  Nick Lea and Ivan Sergei were a blast hanging off a chandelier.  The Director (Dale) is a hoot in a S&M suit! (hey that rhymed!)  The only bore was Sandrine Holt.  I'm just waiting for the TV series to come out on DVD, now that was good television!  (And the theme song was pretty good too).",1120780800,2,478,4.0212765957446805
