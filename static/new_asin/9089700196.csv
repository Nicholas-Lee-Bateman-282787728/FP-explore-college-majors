1172591,5,9089700196,"Video is sharp  and  lighting is good.  Sound is excellent.  Other reviewers  did not mention  flowers and birds.  I saw  three bird flights  in scenes  after the first two waterfalls.  As in real life  they are quick  and  at good distance.  Also one insect  in same
scene  the bird appears.  Also noticed a movement in vegetation  left of center of screen  that  I  think was  a person.  There were
a few flowers  near the running water.

1172593,4,9089700196,"I bought video of running water because I find it extremely comforting.  I have an anxiety disorder that can really detract from my quality of life, and things like this are a godsend.  It is calming, relaxing and beautiful.  I love it.  My only comment is that an overlaid sound of running water (with the music) would have made it perfect and 5 stars.  That of course is my taste, many might prefer just the music.  A good investment for anybody that likes enhanced ambiance!",1357603200,12,477,4.552941176470588
1172594,5,9089700196,I have several relaxation DVDs from The Ambient Collection. This is one of my absolute favorites. I wouldn't change a thing.,1329782400,5,124,4.9523809523809526
1172595,5,9089700196,"I have 38 Nature/Relaxation DVDs, including 8 from Tony Helsloot's Ambient Collection and this is my favorite. I have rated it 6/5.  If I had helped film or edit this DVD I wouldn't change a scene.  This is a Standard format DVD but the video quality is excellent to very good.  Color, exposure (brightness), focus are great.  So is the audio quality.
  The DVD is divided into 7 segments.  There are 3 films with longish individual shots and with a nice music background.  There is one film with even longer, 1-2 minutes per shot and with natural sounds.  There are also 3 scenes with nautral sounds where the camera is on and doesn't move for ten minutes, which is one reason I like Tony's DVDs.  The 7 segments can be played solo, or grouped into 3 or 4 segments.  I like to play all and for 85 minutes enjoy great scenes of European streams, cascades, and waterfalls in lush green woods, with a few autumn shots.  This DVD, coupled with Tony's ""A Day at the Beach"" has it all for great relaxation and pure nature scenes.",1235001600,47,1024,4.446236559139785

But there are also different waterfalls, which were recorded with the sounds of nature. Here you can hear the sound of water, which gives the feeling to really sit in nature. In some places, I also had the feeling of standing in the middle of the river which is shown and the water runs right and left past me. The DVD shows how beautiful nature is, some scenes seem very calm, but some scenes also appear very dramatic because of the music.",1445212800,,581,4.4392523364485985

The loop lasts about 10 minutes and immediately resets. The music used in the other videos is very calming and relaxing. There are many scenes to choose from and as such, you can switch depending upon your mood and allow it to either loop or combine with other videos as a montage. My students enjoy it to calm themselves down as well as to provide a backdrop for both writing projects and presentations for earth science. Very well made (although some scenes are not as sharp as others, but that is due to either your display or the weather being shown...fog, rain, etc)",1443484800,11,729,4.447761194029851

I started off wanting them to have combined the water sound and the music in the first track, and suddenly and quickly I slipped into a deep quiet space so...it worked!  I haven't really liked some of the other Ambient DVD's but this one was a keeper.  I have a TV in my kitchen where I also do other work, and this is wonderful to play throughout the day.  Everything on TV is revolting so this has been a great 'companion' for me and the dog!  He loves it too!
Keep trying DVD's until you find one that works for you- everyone needs an antidote for the harshness of the world today.  This DVD would be a great 'break' from work at lunch time too- like a reset button.

We run it durning the day on our big screen, not that big really, and it is a pleasure to glance over at it as we pass by durning the day.  There are many different tracks, some with music, a relaxing piano selection and some with the sounds of the waterfalls. There is just one problem however,  and it is the fact that it is so nice a DVD that it makes you stop and sit and watch it and Oh No....
Relax.  Really in this world, stop, sit and relax.  What were they thingk when they made this DVD.  Seriously it is a excellent, relaxing DVD.",1396051200,19,690,3.9565217391304346

There are soothing scenes of waterfalls and rivers with just the sound of the water - it really does take you away from the chaos that is life for a while. You feel like you're standing right in front of the water - it almost seems like you can feel the spray coming off the falls.  My favorite part is the Autumn Cascade as you get to enjoy the waterfalls, etc., along with the fall scenery. That is the best! The Red River has beautiful colored rocks as well as the the relaxing sound of water. While there is music on the DVD, I don't need it to just drift away. Awesome photography as usual.
