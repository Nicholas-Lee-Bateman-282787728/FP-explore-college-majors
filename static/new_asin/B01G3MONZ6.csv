8762268,3,B01G3MONZ6,"On the plus side, the soundtrack is by George Clinton which gives the film that ""Miami Vice"" feel. On the remote island nation of Blackbeard Island U.S. Marines who guard the embassy are disappearing...being kidnapped by ninjas who dress all in black and never stand out. Two Rangers are called in to replace the marines and find out what is going on, Curtis Jackson (Steve James) and Joe Armstrong (Michael Dudikoff) who contrary to his anme fights with his feet.

The movie is 80's corny. The fight scenes are over choreographed and done to music that makes the fighting ""light"" in nature. No one owns a gun so they all fight ninja style. I enjoyed the film as a campy look at the 1980's. As a stand alone film, it is passe.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1531612800,,755,4.5036496350364965

8762273,5,B01G3MONZ6,"I really like this movie, but the choreography isn't nearly as good as the first movie. Some of the shots should definitely have been redone. Still one of my favorites though.",1483833600,,175,4.67741935483871
8762274,3,B01G3MONZ6,I like action but the plot wasn't very good so the action is about the only thing to keep your attention. Three stars is probably a little generous.,1477958400,,148,4.321428571428571

8762276,5,B01G3MONZ6,"Blu-Ray: 5/5
Movie: 4/5

Blu Ray: This Blu Ray comes with a commentary with the director and some guy and a ""making of"". The video transfer is great with good video quality and sound.

Movie: This sequel is just as stupid and silly as the first with a dumb-*** plot, nit-witted acting and so forth but does improve on the action some. Liked the first American Ninja? This one is equally as good.",1472688000,4,395,4.397260273972603
