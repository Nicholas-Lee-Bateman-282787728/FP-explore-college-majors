8210648,5,B000TSS4ME,The kids love it and it's nice to have some more episodes for them to watch. Little Bear is such a sweet show b/c it is not at all annoying for the parents to listen to either.,1360108800,,176,3.7837837837837838
8210649,3,B000TSS4ME,"Unlike all the other Little Bear movies we own this one does not end after each episode or introduce the next episode with it's title when you choose play all.
