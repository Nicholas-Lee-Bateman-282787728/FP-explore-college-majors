He does an excellent job (pun intended) at showing the details of difficult, but necessary jobs, denigrating only his own efforts, never putting down or embarrassing the folks who actually scoop the poop or do the other Dirty Jobs they find to showcase.
A great gift for kids, and for the kid within us all.",1388966400,,434,4.576923076923077
