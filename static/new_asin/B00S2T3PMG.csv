8697079,5,B00S2T3PMG,"To fully understand the importance of fracking as a way to mining natural gas and oil lodged deep underground, and the impact of the Shale Rock Revolution, all Americans need to become as informed as possible about the process, the potential dangers and the multitude of benefits from fracking. Thats the intention and theme of a new video documentary, Breaking Free: The Shale Rock Revolution. This insightful and informative 60 minute exploration of fracking explores every possible aspect of this controversial practice to search miles underground for sources of energy and successfully proves the effectiveness and safety, game-changing source of energy independence. Its a colorful, multi-faceted source of vital information necessary to fully understand how American can truly Break Free from the constraints of the last half-century.

The documentary begins by revisiting 1973 -- a time when Americans first realized that we were, quite literally, running out of gas. Since then, it is noted that every American president has promised to make this country energy independent, yet somehow forty-plus years later, that goal has not been achieved. But with fracking, Breaking Free shows there there is new reason for hope. This documentary convincingly reveals how farming for natural gas and oil imbedded in the rock beneath the surface of American land, has allowed companies to begin to achieve that long-awaited goal. Scientists and engineers have discovered that by fracking  creating fractures deep within the earth by the innovative method of horizontal, hydraulic blasts of water and sand  they can analyze through seismic, three dimension imaging tributaries and seams of natural gas and oil. In 2015, some 10,000 fracking sites have been established with an emphasis on safety to the water aquifer

One after another, industry experts, environmental advocates and land owners who have benefited from this fracking, speak candidly about the Ingenuity, and genius of fracking. We hear from James Carroll, a Geophysicist from Dallas, Texas; Chris Faulkner, CEO of Breitling Energy; Dr. Ken Medlock III, a leading economist, Native American tribal leader Tex Red Tipped Arrow Hall and many others about how retrieving energy from underground shale rock is the safest, most cost effective method of mining natural gas and oil. The documentary fearlessly addresses highly controversial issues including the environmental impact (which one expert described as all hype) and the potential danger of causing earthquakes. Breaking Free also looks into alternative energy sources like wind and solar, which everyone seems to agree are safe, but unreliable, because they their intermittency and undependability..

One young, idealistic environmentalist, author Bjorn Lomberg, states that if we are honestly concerned about global climate change, we must focus on fracking, as well as switching from coal of oil and innovative and a long term commitment to green energies. The economic impact of fracking is overwhelmingly persuasive, as this documentary demonstrates again and again how this new industry has dramatically driven down the cost of other natural resources, created new jobs, rebuilt communities, and perhaps most importantly, decreased American dependence on oil from Middle Eastern countries.

While many will continue to oppose fracking, Breaking Free celebrates the ingenuity, research and development that make this scientific achievement a uniquely American revolution that, can lead America to a new energy independence and prove to be truly miraculous in its simplicity, security and safety.",1433203200,,3614,5.5978062157221204
