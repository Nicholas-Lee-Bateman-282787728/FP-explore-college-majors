4573033,1,B0055CP9S6,The first couple of reviews must have been written by folks involved in the production. What horrid and inept film making. In an era where lower budget Zombie flics can actually be GREAT there is no excuse for this sort of crap. AVOID IT.,1320105600,4,238,4.431818181818182
4573034,1,B0055CP9S6,"I'm a huge zombie fan.....HUGE! I've read almost all the zombie books, seen all the zombie movies, I have lots of zombie T-shirts, a zombie hunter permit on my truck, I LOVE ZOMBIE STUFF! And I could not sit through this DVD. It was HORRIBLE! The characters were cartoonishly bad, the editing was horrible and don't even get me started on the zombies. Zombies that growl and have fighting skills???? Not a chance. I can deal with slow zombies, ""28 Days Later"" fast zombies or ""The Walking Dead"" kinda quick zombies. But I can't deal with these. I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Save your money.",1319587200,10,599,4.555555555555555
4573035,5,B0055CP9S6,"this indie film is put together really well.  It is exceptional in special effects, music and setup. The characters are well put together.  If you like Walking Dead this is much better, as the characters are not cleaned up and ready to go. They are dirty and they do dirty things. Never a dull moment",1316736000,14,300,4.4363636363636365
4573036,5,B0055CP9S6,"Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption (2011), directed by Ryan Thompson, takes place years after the initial outbreak, with a diverse cast of characters. Governments of the world attempted to use nuclear weapons to fight the millions of undead, which had no effect, and screwed over the remaining survivors even more. Not surprisingly, the survivors form different groups and fight over what little resources are left.

The main character, Johnny Knox, falls in with a group led by a drug-addicted psycho named Rome. Knox has trouble following Rome's orders, and is sentenced to death. His brother takes him out to the desert, rather than watch Knox be burned at the stake. Knox is nearly killed by some zombies, when he is rescued by another group of survivors. They are led by a guy named Moses, played by none other than Hollywood B-movie legend Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson. When Rome finds out that Moses and his fellow survivors are harboring Knox, he orders his raiders to completely wipe out the camp, including the women and children.

There is no lack of action in this movie, and the special effects are better than what you often find in a SyFy weekend movie. The dialogue was pretty entertaining as well, with some great lines, and a talented cast that did not disappoint. As a matter of fact, ZA:R won ""Best Movie Made in Michigan"" at the 2011 Motor City Nightmares.",1311984000,41,1372,4.858974358974359

Alot of zombie movies are garbage, but this one deserves to be given a chance.  I actually plan to watch it a second time.

The plot is poorly written, but I'm not watching it for the plot.  I'm watching it for the action.  After the zombie apocalypse, there's a guy who leaves a gang of marauders and winds up joining a small group of survivors.  There's scavenging, fighting zombies, and fighting marauders.  That's what I'm looking for.

4573388,1,B0055CP9S6,"Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption (Ryan Thompson, 2011)

I loathed Zombie Apocalypse; in my review of that one, I said (and Amazon saw fit to quote), ""There is not a single thing about this movie that might make you want to watch it."" And yet I just found myself watching the sequel, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption, the lowest-rated movie on my Netflix queue. I was entirely unsurprised at how awful this movie was; it is, in fact, even worse than Zombie Apocalypse. What did surprise me, however, is the ways in which it was awful. Redemption has sweet FA to do with the original movie. Now, had Ryan Thompson learned a few things about how to make movies between filming the first one and filming the second, that might have been a good thing. Unfortunately, he didn't.

Plot: Redemption takes place in the same universe as the original film, at some point in the future, after someone (it is never explained who) has decided to bomb the planet in order to get rid of the zombie problem. As a side effect, this has turned most of the planet's surface into a desert wasteland where bands of survivors prey on one another for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding the zombies that remain. Knox (Whip It's Johnny Gel), a former military man and former raider, finds himself taken in by a band of survivors led by the enigmatic Moses (M*A*S*H's Fred Williamson, who looks damn good for being over seventy). Unfortunately, the leader of his former crew, Rome (The Spirit of Mumbai's Jerry Lynch), will stop at nothing to retrieve his former employee...and anyone who gets in the way can be considered collateral damage, living or undead.

There's really nothing to say about this movie other than ""it's godawful."" As with the first film, every last aspect of it--the acting, the direction, the lighting in the interior scenes, the soundtrack, anything else you would consider while thinking about making a movie--ranges from substandard to downright inept. I considered on a number of occasions simply turning this off while not intending to come back to it, something I have only done with a handful of movies over the course of my movie-watching career (my spreadsheet isn't complete by any means, but as of now it lists 3,507 movies; I have abandoned less than ten).

I didn't care for the story line and they left a few loose ends. I'm undecided if it was worth it or not. Some of it was expected and typical. I will let you decide your own review.

4573399,3,B0055CP9S6,"Ok , compared to most movies this is a one star dud. it's a typical very low budget movie made by first timers. And has the usaul type of mistakes , like where badguys blow up and noone notices etc. Still the whole enterprise does feature alot of gunfights as the evil raiders battle the good guys who live in some kind of camp. the whole thing is minus budget  stuff but it's still about what you would expect. If you don't expect much then you won't be unhappy. This is no worse than the endless drive in freatures of the seventies and it's similiar shlock all the way. But I like shlock and this is modern shlock. Clunky scenes and dialong abound  but that's what I expected. Of course most fans want too much , but I even like 'zombie lake' which makes this one look really good. If  you want a zombie movie mixed with a group of bad guys who shoot at everything and has a mixture of running and walking zombies; A first perhaps? then this one is good for a watch. If you hate shlock then don't bother , cuz to you it  will be a one star movie.",1357862400,,1048,4.122549019607843
4573400,5,B0055CP9S6,"People tend to forget, or just don't know how to enjoy a good B-movie. The fact of the matter is that all of these negative reviews are done by people who are movie snobs, and take movies waaay too seriously. *whispering* The secret is... just kick back, relax, and have a good time!

The acting was perfect for this movie. It's purposely overacted/underacted, and matches the over the top dialogue and action that goes along with it. Overall pacing was good, however, I will say that the pacing towards the end could have been done a little better (it gets a little slow in the last half hour or so). If you go into this thinking Space Odyssey 2001, looking around for all sorts of symbolism, life lessons, social commentary, or if you're looking for Oscar winning performances... look elsewhere...

4573401,5,B0055CP9S6,I like these kinds of movies when they're actually good and this one was done very well. It's mostly a post apocalyptic story with zombies but it has a great plot and even though it's a smaller budget it has a better story than some bigger budget movies. I will say it's not for people that don't have the patience to understand how to tell a good low budget movie from a bad one and throw them all into the same pot because they didn't have a 100 Million dollars to spend making the film. The acting was on par with what you'd expect from an action film. The Choreography was all right. I mostly find myself just enjoying the film for reminding me of those 80's action films that used to be over the top but still entertaining.,1356739200,,728,4.244604316546763

4573404,3,B0055CP9S6,"Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is about John Knox, a man who's left for dead yet finds himself rescued by members of a survivor camp. Knox must prove his worth and rise above suspicion before he is completely accepted by his rescuers. Peace is short lived, however, when an attack by a rival group of ex-military raiders leaves their camp devastated. It's up to Knox and those who survived the attack to gather their resources and launch a rescue mission on the raiders' fortress. All the while facing a land overrun by zombies.

As far as the movie, itself, is concerned; it's not that bad. However, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption tries too hard to be too many things. I think, that is the one thing that brings the movie down. I believe if things were more focused that the movie might have been alot more worthwhile.  Really the only redeeming quality to me, with this movie, is Fred Williamson.

As it stands, though, Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is your basic low-budget zombie movie with a high body count but with little else going for it. I wish I could give it more praise but it's just okay to me.",1345766400,,1106,4.661538461538462

4573417,4,B0055CP9S6,"Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is a bare bones, low budget movie made by folks who appear to be having fun with what was clearly a labor of love.  The basic synopsis of the plot is that John Knox, the main character, is condemned to death by the group of Apocalyptic Raiders he fell in with after the dead have risen and the world is overrun by zombies.  The reason for his sentence is that he no longer wants to follow the leader Rome, who like Knox is ex-military, but is a psychopath that slaughters for fun and for no other discernible reason.  Knox is allowed to escape by one of the other members of the group who apparently also doesn't like Rome much either (and gets executed for his troubles).  The escape isn't without hardships, since Knox is left handcuffed and is sent out into the desert.  He manages to avoid getting devoured by a zombie and gets rescued by a band that roams the wastelands doing their best to fend for themselves.  They are led by a man named Moses (Fred Williamson) who is likely the only member of the cast that the vast majority of the audience might know.  Knox does his best to help his new found friends, even though trust is hard to come by given the fact that they know of his raider past.  At the same time, his old nemesis, Rome, wants Knox found and executed, and so the hunt is on.  Of course, the two groups end up clashing and in the end this tale becomes a battle between good and evil, with a horde of the undead smack dab in the middle of it all.
I was provided this movie for review because I am essentially a zombie-fiend.  I review mainly zombie and other horror-type novels, but now and then I will review a movie.  Yes, this is a very low budget movie and is very much a b-grade flick.  Some of the dialog was a bit rough and every now and then unintentionally amusing.  Jerry Lynch, who plays the head bad guy, appears to be fond enough of chewing scenery that he probably got indigestion after he was done here.  Nope, this one won't win any major awards, but for me, it was a fun post apocalyptic zombie flick.  You sort of have to just go with it-accept the limitations of having minimal budget, no real known actors, and a simple apocalyptic premise.  If you can do that, this movie is fun to watch.  The concept is workable, with a bit of a Road Warrior type feel to the bad guys with their mishmash of armor and a deluded leader who craves power.  Fred Williamson might be a bit too old to be doing fight scenes (he is over 70, after all), but even watching him do that after having seen him in plenty of classic B-Grade action flicks of the past brought a smile to my face.  This is a simple, rock 'em, sock 'em zombie flick with a high body count and no hidden meanings.  Pick your side, grab a weapon, and kill both the undead as well as the living that would kill you first if they had the chance.  Go in knowing what to expect here and you will probably have some fun with this one.",1328313600,6,2949,4.249103942652329

8457881,3,B0055CP9S6,"""It is the year 12 AZ.  12 years ago in a last ditch effort to turn a losing war against the zombie apocalypse virus (Zav) the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to detonate their entire nuclear arsenals at tactical sites all over the globe.  The results were disastrous.  98% of the human population was destroyed en masse the numbers of the undead horde can no longer be calculated by current technology but their presence is pervasive.  Survival is existence and most of the greenland has turned to irradiated wastelands.  In a world where zombies outnumber humans 10,000 to 1, it can be impossible to tell the difference between the men and the monsters"".

We see a man out in the desert with a bag over his head.  Another man says ""Don't say I never did anything for ya!""  The man takes the bag off his head and the rag from around his mouth.  He pees on a red cloth and puts it on his head to keep his scalp moist.  Handcuffed, he walks across the lonely desert as 80's-style music plays.  He eventually falls down from the draining heat but manages to get up and continue walking.  At night he arrives to a fire.  He sees a man under a sleeping bag with blood dripping from his mouth as he says ""Help me"".  He sees the bloody guy where he came from.  The guy continues to say ""Help me"".  The man then beats the helpless guy with a frying pan!  I guess he helped the guy, but not how he wanted.  That's not what he meant to do man!

The man finds water in a bottle and thank goodness for that.  After a long day of walking in the hot desert that's exactly what the doctor ordered.  Just then a zombie walks by and tries to attack, but the man is able to grab a gun... without any bullets!  He smacks the zombie with a sword before stabbing him.  The zombie got a couple blows in.  We now see two men and a woman drive up to a sleeping zombie.  They blow his brains out.  We now see a tournament taking place involving an old man with gas being poured all over him.  The leader says this old man has been charged with treason and the penalty is death.  ""How do you plead?"" *old man spits in his face!*

The leader says he must confess.  If the old man defeats a man about to enter on stage he'll be granted the mercy of the blade and understand the purification of fire.  The old man is then set on fire.  The man in the desert is now in a tent and begging for water.  A man and woman are here.  The woman says this man could be a maniac like the rest of them.  The man tells him to get used to sharing and can't reveal where he is.  He can't be freed by his handcuffs either.  A man named Moses enters the tent and asks the handcuffed guy who he is.  We now see a man acting like a king in what appears to be a dungeon.  He's with a woman slave and says he's going to drain the blood of every single living mother in this wasteland and paint the sky with it.  A man enters and says he found the remnants of a man at a camp.  He says someone is dried up under 10 feet of sand.  The king says he wants someone named Knox's corpse.  The guy says if we sent out more scouts that means more gas and supplies but their stock pile is low enough as it is.

Back at the tent Moses says he found cigars at the same time he found the handcuffed man.  Doctor Potter and Sarah are introduced as the man and woman.  The handcuffed guy says his name is Knox.  Moses wants to know how he got those cuffs on him.  Knox says he made friends with the wrong people- a band of ex-military survivors.  When the war ended it's when people thought it would be a great idea to microwave the entire planet.  Knox says he's ex-military.  His brother was Special Ops.  When the military broke down there was nowhere to go so people did what they had to do to survive.  Knox had to get out of there.  Moses says if Knox screws him over he will leave Knox in the desert like his friends did.

The man who takes off Knox's handcuffs says he was into magic as a kid, particularly ones that involved escaping from locks.  Knox checks out the camp site.  Sarah says she doesn't believe anything Moses says and will be watching him.  Knox says ""Thank God- my guardian angel is on vacation"".  He stumbles into a couple men using their shooting skills to bet on cigarettes.  One man wants to go for 3 packs by shooting a zombie's head in the distance.  Knox gets into an argument with Sarah again.  She points a gun at him while Knox points his gun at a man riding a motorcycle in the distance.  What the!  He smacks the gun away from Sarah and runs to a red jeep, and Sarah jumps in willing to help.  She suddenly LIKES Knox instead of wanting to shoot him?  Okay...

Knox drives the red jeep since his motorcycle doesn't function anymore.  Knox shoots the guy on the motorcycle dead.  When Knox checks out the motorcycle suddenly Sarah kicks him in the side of the head.  She says she's going to beat answers out of him.  They wrestle each other.  She says she wants to know the truth.  He says he was a looter, murderer and part of a scout team just like this one.  As they're about to kiss Moses shows up.  She says ""You're lucky Moses got here.  I was about to finish you off!"" and Knox says ""That's the idea sweetheart!""  In a dark room we see a man beat up a zombie with karate moves before breaking his neck.  The man wants another man to search some area.  Moses introduces Knox to a gunman named Roberts.  Moses says he scouted out the locations they can travel.  Moses recommends they don't travel to the dangerous place they just came from.  Knox says these people look prepared and out for trouble.  Moses says he has to recon places like this in order to keep their supplies up.  Roberts says he needs to put the handcuffs back on Knox and dump him away from here.  Moses says ""I'm trusting you out there Knox!  Don't screw up or I'll make your pain legendary"".

Roberts, Knox and others drive somewhere.  Knox recommends parking the truck in the back to avoid contact but Roberts says it's easier to load in the front.  His friends disagree and mention they can be easily be spotted from the front.  Roberts says Knox used to run with these dangerous animals.  When they get out of the vehicle Knox smacks Roberts with his gun and knocks (no pun intended!) him out.  Roberts, Knox and company walk into the nearby building.  Knox mentions two recon units pulled up outside.  Knox says they're going to have to take the offensive.  Knox and company now have to face the opposition.  A woman exits the vehicle outside.  One man who's part of Knox's group says she's hot.  Knox recommends leveling the playing field.  Both groups fire guns at each other when suddenly all this noise alerts hundreds of zombies walking towards them down the street.  They stop shooting at each other and shoot at the zombies.  The woman pulls out a bazooka and fires.  Knox and company try to walk out the back door but that's where the zombies are.  They fend off the zombies and jump in their truck, but the woman with a bazooka pulls out a regular gun and shoots someone named Billy, who's Knox's partner in the passenger's seat.

Back at camp Moses punches Knox in the stomach for knocking Roberts out saying ""If you hadn't knocked him out you'd have another gun to fight!"" pertaining to the fight scene a moment earlier.  Moses thanks Knox for getting through to his men without using force.  That night as Knox stargazes Sarah walks up to him and says the sky is the one thing that saves the city.  She says she talked to Robert and he explained about the event that happened today.  She says ""Like Moses said, not everyone's going to come home"".  They mention how Billy took out a lot of zombies and raiders today.  That king back at the dungeon wants to know why his woman and his men couldn't take down Knox with 20 men and 2 heavily armed vehicles.  She says she tried and had Knox pinned down.  Back at camp Moses says there's been a change of plans.  He's uprooting east in the middle of nowhere.  It's dry and nothing.  Moses says he can't match the firepower of the enemy.  Knox wants to stay and fight.  Moses recommends Knox get as many supplies as he can and to be back in an hour.

They go over the plan.  Knox and Roberts will enter a building as another man will climb the roof.  When they enter they point their guns forward cautiously while hearing a baby crying in another room.  This next scene is REALLY graphic!  A zombie is munching on the poor baby's neck after ripping it from the mother'womb.  Ew!  Roberts and Knox shoot the zombie... and the baby.  Meanwhile the man on the roof sees the zombies roaming around on the ground outside.  He goes crazy shooting them but suddenly an alarmingly high number of zombies come up over the hills and head towards the building.  He radios Knox and Roberts by saying ""We have runners!""  The zombies get inside.  Roberts and Knox fight them off for a while but one zombie reaches the roof top and grabs the gunman by the ankle.  The man jumps up and karate kicks the zombies down.  He finds himself surrounded by zombies and eventually gets chewed apart.  The zombies take out his intestines and munch on it.  Knox says ""I hope we packed enough ammo"" but Roberts says ""I hope you don't miss any"".

Back at camp it's time for Moses and Sarah to leave.  Moses tells one man to hide the women and children.  The zombies invade the camp site.  Moses hides in a truck when... a black man bites him?  I guess.  We can't really see what the guy is doing while Moses hides in the truck.  Meanwhile the men shoot the zombies and the fight is on.  This is a pretty weak fight scene though.  The karate moves are lacking and the gunshots are few and far between.  Even then just the action itself is lame because I can't tell who's killing who due to the darkness all around camp.  I like when Moses bashes one man into the side of the truck!  That part's hilarious.  He wipes out the zombies with machine gun fire but by this point I'm not even sure they're zombies!  They might just be their enemies (that king guy and his group perhaps).

Roberts and Knox decide what to do in the building since they're alone now.  Knox says ""You don't think they'd leave without us?""  Roberts says ""Not unless they had to"".  They arrive to camp and see the murdered people and zombies lying around.  Come morning Knox tells one of his men that he wasn't able to find the body of Sarah or Moses.  A soldier named Lucas says ""They took them"".  Knox tells Lucas he did good.  Lucas says there were raiders with machine guns.  They tore this place apart.  In a dungeon a woman wakes up and asks where she is.  The king says ""In the palace of pleasure"".  Knox and Roberts discuss a plan to invade the dungeon.  Knox says there's check points at every entrance and they know his face.  It's Roberts and Lucas job to make sure he can get in.  Lucas tells the kids to be as quiet as they can while he Knox and Roberts get the others.

Knox comes up with an idea to drag one of his men from behind a moving truck while zombies run up to the dragging body.  Knox says the zombies are struggling to keep up but I dunno- that one zombie was inches away from gabbing the guy!  They tie up the man they were dragging and threaten him by saying ""You'll wish you were bit!""  Roberts gives instructions on where to go as the roped man says ""You're all dead man!"" Roberts and Lucas approach the dungeon or church (an armory actually!) with a box full of machine guns in hand.  Roberts and Lucas see Sarah while other members of this recon group see men and women dancing around weirdly.

A door greeter guy asks Roberts and Lucas to open the box.  He complains the inventory is messy and someone will have to sort through each item one by one.  Roberts and Lucas knock the man out and come up with a plan in a private back room as Knox jumps down from above somewhere.  They mention armed guards all over and that it'll take 15 minutes to get to the throne room.  They find C4 in the backroom.  Knox says if the men see his face he's dead but Roberts and Lucas have a better chance of escaping.  Roberts and Lucas wait in line in the cafeteria.  Meanwhile the man Knox and Roberts tied up after dragging his body across the road from the back of their truck is helpless as hundreds of zombies walk up to him sitting on the road and eat him up.  Lucas and Roberts pretend to get into a fight as a way to distract the men in the cafeteria as Knox sneaks up and almost stabs a man with a knife until said man gets word there's a fight that broke out in the cafeteria.  Knox then puts the knife away.

Knox nervously sets the C4 in a back room as Roberts and Lucas continue to beat on each other in the cafeteria.  Just then a man appears and says ""These two broke into the armory!""  They're escorted out.  Meanwhile the king has Sarah chained up and picks on her.  Knox suddenly enters much to the happiness of Sarah.  He asks where the girls are.  Sarah says they're in the dungeon.  The king says ""So these are the two who broke into my house!"" as Roberts and Lucas stand around defenseless.  The king wants to know what happened.  One guy says these men (Roberts and Lucas) broke in with guns in a trunk.  The king questions what's wrong with the man since Roberts and Lucas were here to supply them with weapons.

Knox is now in the same room with the king and Lucas and Roberts.  The king says ""I should've killed you a long time ago!"" before pointing a gun at Knox.  He says ""Say goodbye to each other!"" (Sarah and Knox) and shoots.  Roberts and the other guy get into an argument.  The big guy says ""It takes a big man to clock someone with their back turned"".  Roberts responds by saying ""Your back isn't turned now!"" and invites him to come into the cell so they can take care of this matter.  The man says ""Yeah right, open the cell so you can waltz right out of here?""  Just then Roberts bashes his head into the bars.

Lucas wants to know how much time they have left, but Roberts says ""Enough time to get out of here!""  As the king is about to finish off Knox in the other room Sarah defends Knox by attempting to smack the king with a metal pole.  This enables Knox to take control.  However just then the king gets up shooting at Knox.  The king stomps on Knox's head and grabs his throat, but Sarah intervenes.  He grabs both Knox and Sarah's throat.  Knox then punches the king and says ""Time to play hangman!"" as he wraps a chain around his neck, but the king is able to stand up and beat on Knox.  Knox moves out of the way and the king jumps off the balcony hanged by the chain around his neck, and to make matters worse a bomb explodes him to pieces.  Where did this bomb come from?

Knox recommends that he and Sarah head for the garage.  When Knox rings the bell the zombies outside wake up and head for the church or armory.  Sarah and that woman associated with the king get into a fight after Sarah dodges gunfire.  Roberts is backed into a corner as the zombies become too much.  He can't back up anymore but manages to shoot the zombies away as Knox frees all the women in a cage.  Knox snaps one soldier's neck, grabs his gun and shoots the zombies as they walk inside.  Sarah manages to sneak around and strangle the woman on the floor from behind.

Robert struggles to beat a zombie with a metal pole... and he gets bitten on the neck for his troubles.  Knox and Sarah ask Lucas where Moses and Roberts are.  Roberts wins the fight against the zombie and traps him in a cage but it's too late- his neck is bit.  Knox, Lucas and Sarah head outside.  They kick the zombies out of their way.  A man with a sword prevents them all from entering but someone shoots him so he falls, lol.  Roberts decides to blow himself up since he'll soon become a zombie anyway, which eventually blows up the entire armory.  Knox, Sarah and Lucas leave and head down the highway.  They return to the kids at the camp site to close out the story.

Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption is more of an action movie than a suspenseful or comical zombie film, but it works.  I recommend it.  It has lots of action!  Not so much zombie attacks, but lots of action between the good guys (and girls) verse the raiders.  The characters become decent after a while, but they're pretty forgettable for the first 30 minutes.  The story is cheesy but that's the nature of an action film.",1502928000,,16391,4.265472312703583

8457885,3,B0055CP9S6,"My initial take on this film was that somebody wanted to make a Mad Max type of film but couldn't get any financing, so they added some zombies to the mix so the movie would be made. But then I saw Ryan Thompson was the director, the same guy who directed Zombie Apocalypse, so I guess he had zombies in mind all along, even if they have a minimal role in the picture. Now just for clarification, this movie is not a sequel to Zombie Apocalypse, nor is it related to it in any way except by having the same director. It does have a hinted at back story as if there were an earlier picture, though there wasn't.

The word is that the ""Redemption"" in the title is meant by the director to refer to this film redeeming him after making the atrocious Zombie Apocalypse. But if that is true, he failed. The first film at least had the saving grace of casting a bunch of college students to run around an abandoned factory and the backwoods of Michigan playing Zombie. If you've seen any of the scores of Zombie short subjects on You Tube from all over the world,  you might find them rather fun as a spontaneous public phenomenon regardless of technical values. Some of them are actually fairly professional and some are made by gangs of kids. But here the cast is made up of actors and the film is supposed to be made for theatrical release, so you can't be as kind to it as to one of these homemade jobs.

The movie uses the zombies infrequently, and when they're not actually attacking, no one seems particularly concerned about them. So what you end up with here is a very low budget Mad Max like post-nuclear  setup where the hero is being pursued by an evil gang of survivors led by a master of overacting and joins a good group of survivors. You can pretty much guess what will happen from there.

The people who made the boxes for Thompson's two films are pretty good a making them look pretty gruesome. You would think this was a fairly awesome zombie flick from the box. But it's not at all and can best be appreciated for its many faults: the overacting, the silly fight scenes, the costumes, the perfectly coiffed hairstyles twelve years into the apocalypse, the intact buildings, the 80's style soundtrack. On that level it  has entertainment value but don't see it if you're looking for a real zombie movie.",1461369600,2,2316,4.424882629107981
