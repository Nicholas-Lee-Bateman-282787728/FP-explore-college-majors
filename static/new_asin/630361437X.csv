702897,1,630361437X,Movie was horrible and misrepresented to what I thought it was going to be. If I could I would get my money back. It was a mistake on my part for ordering it.,1498953600,,158,3.8181818181818183

702905,3,630361437X,Not one of Tupak Shakur best movies. The story is not as exciting as Poetic Justice or Bullet. I think this movie is better than Juice.,1485302400,,135,4.230769230769231

702982,5,630361437X,"Above the Rim is an excellent hood/basketball film that is very strangely obscure along with another excellent Tupac film Juice. Tupac gives outstanding performances in both films and shows what a great film actor he was. The rest of the cast is aces as well, especially a terrific and unexpected performance from Marlon Wayans. If you like hood films and are a fan of basketball films especially of the great White Men Can't Jump, Above the Rim is a must see. It's criminal and really bizarre that Above the Rim isn't on blu ray. Hopefully with the upcoming Tupac biopic, Warner will right that wrong.",1483747200,,602,4.742857142857143

703123,5,630361437X,"Without a doubt my favorite basketball movie of all time. Duane Martin does a tremendous job as the film's lead role, Kyle Watson, a young high school basketball star waiting on a scholarship from Georgetown. Also stars the brilliant Tupac Shakur as the local drug lord, Birdie, and Leon as his estranged brother and former basketball star. Marlon Wayans entertains as Kyle's best friend Bugaloo, and Bernie Mac steals the show as the homeless drug addict ""Flip"" Johnson. Tons of awesome basketball action and lots of great Tupac moments. A movie with a lot of heart that deserves more credit than it receives. Also features future star of HBO's ""The Wire"" Wood Harris as Tupac's number two gangster.",1453852800,,700,4.940677966101695

703762,4,630361437X,"Great Movie!  This movie defined an early era of sports in America.  Hollywood realized that there is a viable market for sports and minority actors.  Many people may not have the money to purchase a Pro or College ticket to a professional game.  However, a movie that inspires and creates a sense of oneness with the characters in a film can still lead a young person to greatness in other areas of his/her life.
In life, we all need to take a moment to reflect to determine who we are and what we will become within our society.  All the characters in this movie played their roles and it is up to us to define our own through their on screen depictions.",1411948800,,656,4.344262295081967

704092,4,630361437X,"Equal in quality to White Men Can't Jump and uses less profanity(and no nudity) in doing so! WMCJ is ""gd"" this and ""gd"" that throughout most scenes--if not all! Still, you don't want to watch this one with the kids. They have a medium amount of profanity and they make sexual, private parts references in certain areas.

Tupac was the comedian of the group; even though, Bernie Mac and Marlon Wayans have better resumes for comedy. You couldn't tell the difference. Tupac(Birdie) has this snide, dirty, narcissistic persona that has an incredibly hot temper that you may not ever know that you've crossed--ever! He is the best and gets 5 stars for his performance. Duane Martin(Watson) does a good job with the arrogant--not as good as he wants to be or hypes himself up to be--phenom athlete and gets 4.5 stars; this is the main character. Leon(Shep) is the ""NBA caliber"" player who is always running from his potential; brother and enemy of Birdie. He gets 4 stars. Marlon Wayans(Bugaloo) and Bernie Mac(Flip) also get 4.5 stars in limited roles and understand their roles well(don't try to do too much and blend into the background).  There is also the lead player of Birdie's dirty squad(Motar or Montar), who moonlights as Birdie's enforcer on and off the court. This movie merges the gang life with basketball and doing it the wrong way  or doing it the right way and how negative befalls you--if you do it the wrong way.  In most ways, that's life! Watson is tempted by Birdie(because Watson has a showboat mentality and his coach boldly confronts him about it; this messes with Watson's ego; Birdie does everything to manipulate his ego so that he'll play with the Birdmen over his coach's team) and recruited by Shep to see if he can gain enough of Watson's respect to guide him to doing it the right way. The actors also mesh together like old sitcom veterans. The basketball scenes are average to good with too much replaying of the same scenes at times. Leon being toppled on the concrete as if it were wood and getting up and playing on was over-the-top and not believable. The refs were also not believable; they let Birdie's men get away with murder and then they changed to Shep and Watson's side. They would have been believable if Birdie had bought them and they remained bad for Birdie's goons, but it made me wonder when they started giving the other side calls. Either you're a clean ref that misses a few calls, a clean ref not good enough to be a good ref, or you're dirty. These refs are worse than dirty or inept; they are indecisive about which calls-- that they can see as clear as day--they will make and they make none.

But elsewhere is where you'll have to focus for shots of entertainment. That's assuming you can get pass all the overacting and pointless violence.

704195,4,630361437X,"""Above the Rim"" is about the city game of basketball, played on asphalt in a rough, physical style, where the rewards are status and glory in the neighborhood. It was shot on location in Harlem, and especially at Rucker's Playground, a legendary court where, in the 1970s, visiting stars like Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving would drop by to play with the local heroes.

The movie moves the action up to the present and tells the story of a high school basketball whiz named Kyle (Duane Martin) who has attracted the attention of top college scouts. A Georgetown recruiter has been in the stands for several games. Kyle dreams of someday playing in the NBA and waits anxiously for a letter of intent from Georgetown, which doesn't come - maybe because, in an attempt to impress the scout, he's been hogging the ball and taking unwise shots.

Parallel to high school basketball, but in a world of its own, is the neighborhood Shoot-Out, a tournament held at Rucker's Playground with teams sponsored by local merchants, including drug dealers. Kyle plans to play for a team run by his school coach. But then his best friend, Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans), talks him into visiting a club run by the sinister Birdie (Tupac Shakur), and the kid is seduced by its shabby glamor into agreeing to play for Birdie's team.

This is not a wise move. Birdie is a drug dealer, and that's a fact well-known to the tall, silent Shep (Leon), a former Rucker's star who moved out of town but is now back as a security guard at the high school. Shep was once friendly with Kyle's mother (Tonya Pinkins), and now, as they begin to see each other again, he tries to guide Kyle in the direction of college, and away from the superficial glories of the Shoot-Out.

The movie climaxes, of course, with the big Shoot-Out game, and with a violent surprise that I found less than likely. But that's not really what it's about. It's more about the dreams of poor black kids to use their basketball skills as a ticket out of the inner city.

This is an elusive dream, as the brilliant Chicago-based documentary ""Hoop Dreams"" demonstrates. Only a tiny percentage of high school stars ever play in college, let alone in the NBA. But kids like Kyle can't help hoping. And both Shep and his mother point out that education, not the NBA ticket, is the real reason to go to school.

The movie lives easily on the streets where it is shot, and the performances - especially by Martin, Shakur and Pinkins - are convincing. We get a sense of the daily rhythm of the character's lives, and for a drama, the movie finds room for a surprising amount of humor, especially in the dialogue.

The movie, directed by Jeff Pollack, was co-written by Pollack and Barry Michael Cooper, who wrote the poetic and evocative Wesley Snipes drama ""Sugar Hill."" In both films Cooper has a strong interest in family, in how extended support networks can fill some of the gaps left by the disintegration of the traditional family unit.

Here Kyle is a kid in a lot of potential trouble, but also with a lot of good support.

My complaint about the movie is that the plot goes on automatic pilot in creating the character of Birdie. The neighborhood drug dealer is such a standard cliche by now that it's almost as if they plugged him into the movie as a shortcut to a villain. Shakur plays him well, and he makes a satisfactory bad guy, but the subliminal message is that drugs are where the money is. The movie could have come up with more original choices.",1159920000,,3498,4.584
704196,4,630361437X,"Well, here's a movie I didn't want to see at all (I loathe basketball), but I enjoyed it very much. Two actors to watch who are very charismatic - Leon and Tupac Shakur (whose murder robbed the screen of a very fine talent).  The former exudes a quiet power reminiscent of Lawrence Fishberne; the latter has amazing eyes with incredibly curly lashes.  Another note:  I haven't seen a movie that looked this sharp and clear, whose colors were crisp and bright, in many a year.  And the basketball shots during the ""tournament""!  Wow!  What editing!  Whoever did that really knew his stuff.  The story was fairly hokey - good guy, bad guy, competing for the young basketball whiz, and fairly predictable.  I did think his overblown jealousy of his mom dating Leon a little too too.  But Shakur's portrayal of the local king-pin was very effective.  He actually seemed friendly and OK, but the menace below was subtly done.  I have seen him before in ""Poetic Justice"".",1143676800,3,965,4.712574850299402
704301,4,630361437X,"The 1995 classic basketball movie ""Above The Rim"" is a great movie, even though it is going on ten years old. However, time can not erase the fact that this movie is spectacular. The cast of characters is good, the script is good, and overall this is an awesome movie if you're a fan of Tupac Shakur, or just a fan of basketball movies with more than just basketball in it.

The story is about Kyle Watson (Duane Martin) and Tommy ""Shep"" Sheppard (Leon). Kyle is really into basketball and he plays for the high school team, but he's a little self centered on the court. When his friend Bugaloo (Marlon Wayans) busts out of jail, he introduces Kyle to Birdie (Tupac Shakur), who wants to put Kyle on his annual Shoot Out Tournament team. Even though Kyle told his coach he was going to play for him in the shoot-out, he decides to play for Birdie, as he offers him somewhat of a better or good life. This part of the story is kinda cliche, either sell your soul for riches or do the right thing and go the better way out. Which one will Kyle choose when it's time? Shep has a story of his own. From what I could tell, Shep was a very good ballplayer when he was Kyle's age. Due to a certain tragedy, Shep threw it all away. Shep comes back from where he ran to, and ends up meeting Kyle's mother, and starts dating her. Kyle doesn't like Shep at all, due to a little bit of Birdie's influence, who is tied to Shep. Turns out, Shep helps Kyle throughout the movie.

There is not many extras on the DVD though. You could either get this on VHS or DVD and have the exact same thing. The movie has a great cast to back it up: Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans, Leon, Tupac Shakur, Tonya Pinkins, Bernie Mac, etc. They are all great in their roles. Despite being just about a decade old, this movie stands the test of time for me. It also has a great soundtrack, featuring hits such as ""Regulate"" by Nate Dogg and Warren G, and ""Pour Out A Little Liquor"" by 2Pac, and ""Pain"" by 2Pac and the Outlaws, which is one of my favorite songs. It really fits with the movie when they play it.

However cliche the storyline may be, this is still an excellent movie. The acting is tremendous, especially by Tupac and Marlon Wayans. This movie also established Leon and Marlon as 2 of my favorite actors. If you're looking for a great basketball movie with enough drama to keep you entertained, other than basketball, then this is the movie for you. This is also a good addition to your 2Pac collection (R.I.P.) Go ahead and buy Above the Rim now!",1116115200,,2524,4.298319327731092

704303,4,630361437X,"""Above the Rim"" is an entertaining street drama that focuses around Kyle Lee Watson, an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him.  He won't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game, as he thinks that he is the best player ever.  He's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout's attention, but he does catch Birdie's eyes when he plays.  Birdie is a well known gang leader who offers Kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a ""Shoot-Out"" basketball contest that means the world to him.  Kyle--being impatient as ever--agrees to join, not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him.  A high school security guard with a past knows the danger that Birdie presents, and he is the only who has a chance to get through to Kyle before it is too late.

Not only is this a very good basketball movie, but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life... and how we have to live with them in the long run.  The film has some great performances from Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans and the late Tupac Shakur.  Even though everybody is great in their roles, the showstopper is indeed Shakur.  He gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  My only complaint is the length of the movie.  It's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn't short, but I think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie.  I think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story.  Still, it is a really good movie that didn't disappoint me.

The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer.  You can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen, depending on your preference.  The movie looks and sounds very good.  The only special features that are offered are movie trailers, and those aren't even that great.  I would've loved it if they included the music video, ""Regulate"" by Warren G and Nate Dogg.  In fact, given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie, they could've included a couple of music videos.  It's not a great DVD, but at least it's not that expensive.

I really enjoyed ""Above the Rim.""  It may not be flawless, but it definitely does more right than wrong.  The characters are what really dominate the movie.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, it's still something to check out if you're a fan of character drama.  Exciting, intense, conflict-driven and full of heart, ""Above the Rim"" is a very well done film. -Michael Crane",1094169600,14,2684,4.439672801635992

704306,3,630361437X,"Playing like a big-screen version of MTV's ""Rock N' Jock Basketball"", ABOVE THE RIM is more flare than substance but that isn't neccessarily a bad thing. Not every urban film needs to provide the harsh narrative morals of films like ""Boyz N The Hood"". Those expecting a pull-no-punches commentary on young inner-city athletes may want to stick with ""He Got Game"". ""Rim"" has heart though. It's predictable and cliche at times but it's still a lot of fun. Having one of the very best soundtracks of the year didn't hurt things either.
""Rim"" follows Kyle Waston, one of the hottest high school basketball prospects as he must choose between playing for his overbearing coach or a charismatic local drug dealer in a tournament for city bragging rights. Along the way we learn that the devilish drug pusher is the younger brother of the school's security guard, a former high school star himself who fell from grace after a fatal accident involving one of his friends. Kyle is so manipulated by the money and women being thrown in his direction that he doesn't see that he may be flushing his opportunity down the toilet.
""Above The Rim"", much like ""Juice"" gains so much credibilty from the presence of Tupac Shakur. Pac takes what is in all honesty, a silly and very sterotypical villian and makes him seem so much more. Very few people have the energy and charisma to make it work but he does. The cast certainly holds up their end though as well. Unlike ""Juice"", the movie can survive without Pac on the screen. Wayans as the goofy Buggalo is a nice touch and Martin and Leon are solid leads.
ABTR is an entertaining film but it plays more like a ""very special episode"" of FRESH PRINCE than the urban equivallent of HOOSIERS that so many of its fans tend to label it as. The story is very paint-by-numbers and most of the dramatic elements are thrown in for advancement of the story rather than based on a concious decision to show the true consequences of its protaginist's choices. The script is simple and seems to pander to the audience far too much. Much like a TV show, there is conflict but by the end of it all, every character learns a valuable lesson.",1069804800,7,2159,4.6103896103896105

704518,4,630361437X,"With the Passing of Actor, Rapper, Tu Pac Shakur we may never know how great his acting could have gotten. In this 1994 memorable performance he puts in a chemistry that connects well to his story. This movie may have one  of the simplest storylines about basketball honor but it is really a  metaphor for deeper issues. Kyle played well by Duayne Martin is a high  school basketball great who needs more coaching than his coach can handle  because most of his needs are off the court. Shep (Leon) is a former high  school great who never made the big leagues beacause he was accused of  killing his brother during a one on one game on a roof. Shep taunted his  brother for not being near the player he was but obviously never intended  manslaughter. The interesting piece is that Shep has a mental block and  cannot move past this incident. He even seems to be in severe depression.  Kyle needs coaching and Shep needs to be needed. Seems simple. Not so fast!  In comes Birdie played by Tu Pac who is livid when his living big brother  Shep returns to bury their dead mother and wants no part of his underworld  ways. Birdies influence is more effective on Kyle than Shep, But that's  about to change! Good perfomances by Marlon Waynans,  Kyles friend Bugaloo  and Bernie Mac the bumb in the park, Flip. Good Soundtrack. The movie moves  fast but keys in on more than just jumpers and foul shots. This is not a  movie about basketball rather a basketball movie about people with zeal,  integrity, emptiness and anti social behavior. Some characters have more  than one trait. Some have more than one flaw. While watching this one  you'll want to see where everyone ends up.",955756800,30,1674,4.569023569023569
