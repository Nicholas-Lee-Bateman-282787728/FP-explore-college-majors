8240643,5,B000AV62TC,"Great obscure film about Gypsy jazz and the culture surrounding the music. Also suggest Latcho Drom and Vengo by same producer, Tony Gatlif. These are part ""Rockumentary"" in their style. Lots of handheld camera.",1356739200,,211,5.235294117647059
8240644,5,B000AV62TC,"This is a great intense film, saw it ten years ago in German, now can hear in French with English subtitles. what a way to go. '
That is appears to be an Australian product is even more interesting.",1355443200,,198,4.102564102564102

8240646,4,B000AV62TC,"This is a wonderful movie, I just did not realize I was ordering a French movie with Spanish subtitles! I thought it had English subtitles, at least as an option. Oh well.",1296345600,3,171,4.375
8240647,4,B000AV62TC,"In `Swing' Tony Gatlif gives a very passionate insight into Gypsy music making. The acting and plot are minimal and the movie is a vehicle for the stunning musical performances. Max is about thirteen and writes letters in exchange for Manouche jazz guitar lessons. Max also falls in love with a Gypsy girl named Swing, who is a feisty tom-boy. These young leads do an excellent job and very obviously have a lot of fun. The story line doesn't flow all that well but then standard musicals don't flow either. It is an insight into the importance and place of music in the Gypsy way of life. This is a wonderful movie that has great emotional impact.",1230336000,6,648,4.547008547008547
