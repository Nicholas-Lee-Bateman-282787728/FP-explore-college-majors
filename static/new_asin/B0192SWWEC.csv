7561973,3,B0192SWWEC,"The Beauty Inside is a Korean film about changing ones appearance. Woo-jin (Kim Dae-myung) is a young antiques restorer who finds himself in the bed of a one-night stand, suddenly transformed into a fat guy. Such change is nothing new to him, however, since from the moment he turned 18, he wakes up as a different person every day, of both sexes and all races. The only two people aware of this daily occurrence are his mother (Mun Suk) and best pal Song-beck (Lee Dong-hwi).

The gimmick of this comedy is that Woo-jin is played by 21 different actors but retains his straight-male perspective no matter who he becomes and every version of him is a twenty- or thirty-something, handsome Korean. Woo-jin finds his heart touched when he meets Hong Yi-soo (Han Hyo-ju). He staves off the transformation by forcing himself to stay awake for three days straight, and manages to spend much of that time with her, but when sleep finally overcomes him, he awakens to discover a middle-aged man in his reflection. Unwilling to let her go, Woo-jin tries to remain in her life even if she doesnt recognize him.

Billed as a body-hopping romantic comedy, The Beauty Inside is a clever commentary on appearances and how much we are judged by them.  However, the film plays it fairly safe in that Woo-jins assorted iterations are all good-looking, so we never get a chance to see how someone not blessed with a traditionally attractive appearance would be regarded not only by Hong Yi-soo, but by others as well.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release. The film is in Korean, with English subtitles.",1454112000,2,1619,4.792114695340501
7561974,4,B0192SWWEC,"A mans spirit generates a different human body everyday when he wakes up, but he finds himself in a major dilemma when he falls in love with a beautiful woman.  This mans condition is not in any way similar to something like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where he is taking a different persons body everyday.  Its almost like a brand new body is created every single day to house his soul.  So one day he might be a 25-year old man, another day he might be a 70-year-old woman, and yet another day he might be a 7-year-old boy.  It's easy to invest oneself in the protagonist's situation, because it would be very difficult to build any lasting personal relationships with other people.  In fact, his job is furniture design because he can work at home and communicate with customers via email.  The film not only fully develops his character, but it gives equal attention to his girlfriend and how a woman could possibly cope with being in a romantic relationship with someone whose appearances changes completely on a daily basis.  These two characters are chosen to anchor the entire film, and it works really well.

There's some very good, everyday humor too  which makes this more pleasant than one might expect.  Melodramaticism is tempered nicely, with a tone that is very realistic and romantic.  The bizarre premise allows for a number of different actors and actresses to contribute, because you need a different actor to play his character for every day that passes.  Because of this particular scenario, the girlfriend is in some ways the main character because she is played by the same actress from start to finish (her body doesnt change).  And most fortunately, she is played by the excellent Hyo-joo Han  who you may have seen in films such as Ad Lib Night (2006), Cold Eyes (2013), and Cest Si Bon (2015).  She also starred in the deliciously entertaining K-drama Brilliant Legacy (2009).  Im a big fan of this actress, and this is a very good introduction to her if you're not familiar with her other performances.

A few online reviewers have complained that discrimination and other social issues were not covered by the film (for example, at one point his body is that of a Japanese woman  so these critics would want the film to show how a Japanese woman is treated in South Korean culture), but I felt that the script benefited from maintaining a focus on the romantic relationship between the two main characters  and how the mans condition affects that relationship.  They spend a lot of time developing the main theme, and adding anything else may have resulted in a rushed, over-stuffed film.

In any case, I really enjoyed The Beauty Inside and would definitely recommend it.",1453593600,2,2706,4.763948497854077
7561975,4,B0192SWWEC,"Folks have been discussing the dearth of romantic comedies  and romances in general  lately; some even describe them as dying genres. Films such as this summers hit Trainwreck attempt  and to a certain degree succeed  to revitalize rom-coms by resorting to raunchiness, so prominent and hip nowadays. Others, like the deluge of Nicholas Sparks and John Green YA adaptations, wholeheartedly embrace the inherent sentimentality of the romantic genre, manipulating audiences into weeping by resorting to cheap cliches (e.g. Ryan Gosling proclaiming his love in the rain to Rachel McAdams in the much-beloved atrocity The Notebook).

Americas history of rom-coms seems too steeped in sappy sentiments and overtly forceful moralizing; so it doesnt come as a surprise that it took South Koreas film industry, known for its inventiveness and defiance of conventions, to come closest so far this decade to bringing us a well-made, funny, insightful and honest romance.

The Beauty Inside introduces a spectacularly assured talent to the world of cinema: director Baek Jong-Yeol, previously known for his work on commercials. Here, he elicits subtle performances, complementing them with elegant images and a smooth flow, barely resorting to maudlin, manipulative tactics to make his audiences feel deeply for the fate of his protagonists.

The film starts with a nifty montage, quickly depicting our heros  the 30-year-old Woo-jins  predicament: for the past 12 years, he has been waking up in a different persons body every morning, be it a child, woman and/or foreigner. The colorfully mournful prologue briskly establishes the overall, Charlie Kaufman-esque (yes, I am officially coining that term) tonal juxtaposition of lightheartedness and melancholy.

Woo-jin makes furniture in a spacious but desolate studio, where no one, save for his best friend and work partner, Sang-bek (Lee Dong-Hwi), has to interact with him. Sang-bek takes Woo-jin out to clubs and parties; when Woo-jin is in an attractive young girls body, Sang-bek proposes they make love, just once, for he would never be able to sleep with a girl like that (Woo-jin declines the offer). Whenever Woo-jin finds himself in a handsome mans body, he takes advantage and sleeps with women. Some hilarity ensues: what if you fell asleep with a charismatic stud and woke up with the same man, but in an old, wrinkly body? I can never fall in love, Woo-jin proclaims.

Only he does  with Yi-soo (Han Hyo-ju), a stunning young woman who works at a different furniture shop. Its love at first site, and Woo-sin patiently waits until he is in the body of a good-looking guy to ask her out. They click, and he stays up all night to see her again. People say true beauty lies inside, Woo-jin says dreamily, but first impressions are equally important. After a few nights, his exhausted body caves inHis struggle to stay up for the girl he loves, while maintaining his sanity, functions beautifully as a metaphor for our strive to be as charming on a second  and third, and fourth  date, to live up to established, fragile expectations, as the initial mystery begins to subside. How he explains his dilemma to Yi-soo, and the consequent blossoming  and possibly disintegrating  romance, Ill let you discover.

A variety of international actors play Woo-jin, which may sound confusing, but it all gels surprisingly well; the sparse, lyrical narration, for one, holds it together seamlessly  you never, for a minute, doubt its him, and its all in the little gestures and mannerisms and vocal intonations of the impressive cast. The lead actress, Han Hyo-ju, gives an incredibly memorable performance, by turns subtle and funny and touching. The chemistry between the leads truly sparks.

The Beauty Inside consists of almost-unbearably heartrending moments, such as when Woo-jin comes to his mother after his first transformation, and she recognizes her son almost instantly; or when Woo-jin states longingly about Yi-soo, Shes the only person that understands me, a well-worn phrase that takes a whole new meaning; or the lovely sequence where he taunts her to find him in a crowded square; or even something as simple as a description of a chair  Once a tree, then a ship, and now a chair  which reiterates the films theme of the passage of timeI loved how the custom-made furniture, carefully carved to fit individual postures, mirrored so brilliantly our tendency to customize ourselves to fit expectations.

Thats not to say its all philosophical musings  this rom-com surely lives up to its com element; the film is sprinkled with great, bizarre moments of humor, such as when Woo-jin turns into a young boy. Yi-soo takes him on a somewhat-uncomfortable date  but he gets drunk quickly (The body doesnt lie), and then, completely inebriated and hanging off her neck, insists on picking up the check, confusing the waitress.

Upon closer scrutiny, certain questions do arise. Whose bodies does he take, exactly? Are they real people? If so, do they keep leading their lives, while hes in their bodies? What if he met his counterpart? Would it be a Back to the Future, Armageddon-type scenario? What about allergies? A bit of a passport issue there? The film is also a little too long, and never really delves into the psychological toll frequent transformations like that would have on a body and mindbut then again, that would be too heavy for an allegorical romantic comedy.

If you buy into this admittedly far-fetched premise, youll find a moving parable about alienation, loneliness, friendship, identity, sexuality, societal expectations and, well, the meaning of beauty. What the film truly nails is the wrenching heartache of being in love. Forget your Sparkses and Greens and go see The Beauty Inside. Ill be honest, I was never a fan of romance as a film genre. But this one got to me.",1453334400,2,5848,5.09738219895288

7561982,5,B0192SWWEC,"quirky - charming - romantic film - with the wondrous Han Hyo Joo as a young woman who is the object of affection for a young man who physically changes whenever he wakes up - he might be a man his real age - or an ancient one - or a prepubescent boy - or a woman of any age - or a foreigner who speaks another language (this gives the lovely talented Japanese actress Ueno Juri a pivotal role) - or occasionally - a handsome young man

wisely - no attempt at a scientific explanation is given - any effort to do so would have shattered its fragile premise - so i suggest you don't analyze too much

the title of the film seems to be aiming at a moral which it doesn't convincingly support - outside virile beauty seems to count for more with this girl

this is a languid film with the usual Korean focus on characterization - (it's not for people who need heavy plotting to get them thru a film) - and a thought provoking film in a ""what-if"" sort of way - and while the atmosphere is poignant - it shuns the maudlin

a must see for Han Hyo Joo fans who already know she is one of those magical actresses who is instantly and deeply sympathetic - it's easy to fall in love with her - and hard to fall out of love (tho she has taken on roles that make the viewer do just that) - if you've never experienced her warmly glowing persona - try this film - or the equally watchable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALWAYS/dp/B008ULEIKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALWAYS</a>&nbsp;(with one leading man - So Ji Sub - who she's unable to see cuz she's blind)",1483920000,,1591,4.475862068965517

7561992,5,B0192SWWEC,"I should note that we saw this at an Asian film festival, not here on Amazon.

This is thoughtful, moving, and in moments very funny film. The central plot idea, that someone wakes up each day in a new body (older, younger, man, woman, white, black, Asian, etc.) provides a interesting way to look at how we react and judge based on people's external selves, and also makes for a fun foil for romance. Having a new main character appear every few minutes makes for a very different experience, and there is some fun as several well known Korean actors (male and female) make their appearance as the protagonist. The film does not beat you over the head w/its own judgement about the issues it raises, leaving it to the viewer to decide how far their thoughts and feelings take them after the film.  I believe that is the best approach - otherwise the film risks becoming a pamphlet, rather than what it is - an engaging romance with a thoughtful and though-provoking twist.",1473984000,,973,4.586206896551724

One day she loves the thrill of being with different people and enjoying their company the next she is confused and on medication and blaming her mental instability on this one person's transformations and alas on another day she realizes the error of her thoughts and feelings and is chasing her transforming mate from Korea to Czech in order to reunite.

7562005,5,B0192SWWEC,"THE BEAUTY INSIDE is a welcome digression from the traditional Korean romantic dramas that all too often harp on the stereotyped nuances of family versus love and society versus the individual. Here director Jong-Yeol Baek takes the viewer into a world that deftly combines the pangs of love with the whimsy of the supernatural. Think of GROUNDHOG DAY morphing in and out the shape shifting of various STAR TREK episodes. We learn of a weird phenomenon that defies rationality. In Korea, there is a vanishingly rare genetic trait that literally changes the face and body of a person. Each time that person awakes, he (or she) is a new person, outwardly different but inwardly the same. One morning he (the pronouns become obtrusive) might be an old man, the next day an attractive woman, and the next a little boy. This daily swapping of bodies inevitably leads to a great deal of confusion on a myriad of levels, but wisely director Baek does not make this confusion the moral center of the film. Instead, he focuses on the day to day struggles of the hero (played by no less than a dozen actors) to maintain his mental status quo.

  This changeling is Woo-jin, a dedicated furniture designer, who has long since accepted what to him is the inevitability of a life alone. How could anyone commit to him when a new human being rolls out of bed each morning? One day, however, he snaps out of his isolation when he meets E-Soo (Hyu-ju Han) who also works in the furniture trade. They click and Woo-jin must decide what to tell her of his condition. The first half of THE BEAUTY INSIDE suggests more by indirection than by direction the travails of one who needs to reconcile human need for intimacy with the difficulty of achieving it. The second half delves slightly into melodrama as both lovers grapple with issues that counterbalance a variety of competing human traits: male/female, youth/old age, acceptance/resistance and trust/suspicion. One might think that the large number of actors playing Woo-jin would dilute audience interest, but startlingly, each Woo-jin retains the essential moral compass and verbal tics of the original. Even Woo-jin as a little boy or as a non-Korean speaking woman remains in character. THE BEAUTY INSIDE is not a comedy although it has more than a few humorous moments. In its compelling unveiling of what it means for one human being to love another, the orthodox focus on looks and materialism fades away to be replaced by what ticks in the human heart.",1460764800,7,2495,4.824766355140187

This is about a young man named Woo Jin. On his 18 th birthday he wakes up a different person. Not mentally, mentally he's still the same but physically he is now in a strangers body. This is now how he will have to live the rest of his life. Only two people know about the changes that happen to him when he wakes up every morning. One person is his mother and the other person is his male best friend. His appearance in the morning is always a different body. They will know him because he wears a special bracelet.  There are no set bodies that he changes into. He can change into anyone of any age and of any sex. He can even wake up speaking a language from another country in the body of a person from there. Since this has now happened for many years, his closet is filled with shoes, clothes and glasses in every shape and size. Occasionally, he will get drunk and end up with someone in bed and he has to sneak out before they see him. These transformations are triggered by sleeping. But even as mysterious as his condition is, he has always been in love with E Soo and wants to have a relationship with her. He goes to her work everyday to see her. But she doesn't know him, except as a new customer. One day he gets lucky and has the body of a good looking man and asks her out and decides to not sleep. They spend several days together successfully. Can she accept a boyfriend who is always different everyday ? What will others think about her? Can love last under these extreme conditions? What is the mystery of his father? Why did he just leave? You will be amazed at the answers to these questions. This is one movie that will make you think about what happiness is really.  This does have a very good ending. I didn't even see part of this ending coming. I highly recommend this movie. I'm sure it will be one you will watch over and over again. I seemed to find new things in it every time I watch it.

These are my most trusted sellers. They have the best customer service and communication. Ask a lot of questions. I have had a lot of bad sellers. So, let's keep you away from them. A good seller will answer questions. A seller to avoid is the one who says that they can't look at the set to answer your questions. Such as they sell to many things. When I used these types of sellers, I end up with the wrong item, no item, lied to about it being sent- then cancelled days later. The frustration is not worth it. Ask questions like what  region is it and what country it is made in. Sets made in Malaysia are edited due to their censor board. Because of that, when they have sensitive issues they will edit out kiss scenes, blur knives, and images on walls etc.  I contacted Malaysia to question them about a missing ending for the Chinese drama Bromance that did not have the real ending. That is how I found out. I will go the extra mile, to try to find out information for everyone. As for that drama Bromance, they are the only choice to buy from. I frequently don't watch shows and buy them with the companies I like best, then I don't notice the cuts. But I'm going to be  really picky when Jealousy Incarnate is sold. I have watched this drama. That show is powered by all the kiss scenes and jealousy. None of that is optional, as it is the foundation of the whole show. If you haven't seen it, it's on DRAMA FEVER. I will do my best to give you as much information as possible. Even soundtracks at times. I review dramas and CDs from Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan.  I hope that this review is helpful to you. I started doing this when I was frustrated at Amazon for mixing up the Korean dramas with the American movies. Nope, it's still not fixed. But I did review the Korean drama PHEONIX and not the American movie.

8743731,5,B0192SWWEC,"I liked it. First time seeing this kind of plot/story line. It was really well done, it felt real. I usually don't care for romantic movies, but I found myself really rooting for the two of them to be together.

I was really glad to find that it was not the dubbed version - worried about that with some of the Amazon videos as oftentimes the description will say English subtitles, but still end up being the English dub.
The only problem I had with the Amazon video specifically is that half-way through the subtitles stopped matching up with the dialogue. A couple to several seconds of delay in subtitles showing up throughout once it started. Pausing, skipping and even refreshing the video didn't seem to do anything. Really awkward having entire conversations finish before getting the translation... But that's a technical issue and nothing to do with the film itself so I'll leave at 5-stars.",1519516800,,901,4.7756410256410255
8743732,5,B0192SWWEC,"Seen this film twice now and I just love it even more. It still trips my mind to imagine waking up everyday with a partner whose body changes to a different person daily.  Could I handle it? Then, again, as the title reminds us, it's THE BEAUTY INSIDE that is most important in a loving, respectful and healthy relationship. Well done Han Hyo-joo.... thank you for making this amazing movie!",1516752000,,391,4.585714285714285

8743734,5,B0192SWWEC,"PROS:  Well acted, directed, written.  Best unique romantic comedy I've seen in decades. Deserves 6 stars.

CONS:  A little long, but still captivating the whole way. Worth every minute.",1509321600,,186,5.310344827586207
