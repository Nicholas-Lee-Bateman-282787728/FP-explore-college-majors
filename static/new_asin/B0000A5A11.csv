1903778,5,B0000A5A11,This film was beautiful!! Anne Rice is amazing and this movie followed the book very well! Its is an amazing video and I would love to get it for keeps!,1031356800,3,152,4.1
1903779,5,B0000A5A11,PLEASE release this film. It is the BEST film with an EXCELLENT cast. I must add it to my movie collection. I'm Creole and wasn't aware of this part of our history. Another part of our history African American history that was kept from us.,1028764800,6,240,4.355555555555555
1903780,5,B0000A5A11,"When I saw the movie ""The Feast of All Saints"", I was truly mistified by the information the movie released and also the extraordinary acting.  I was always curious about the Black people from New Orleans and how they became termed as
""Creole"".  The drama was a story of Love, Betrayal, Romance, Finance, Family and Forgiveness. The acting by Jennifer Beal and many of the noted actors and actress' really helped one to understand what was going on in New Orleans in that time period and how Black People chose to survive without having to endure the anals of slavery, yet through the lighter skinned blacks, oppressing the darker blacks still continued the same oppression as their White counter parts.  This movie is a must have for any video library.  Please release soon!",1028592000,6,775,4.804511278195489
1903781,5,B0000A5A11,"This movie is excellent.  The theme is historically insightfull, with regards to African Americans.  It presented a twist on our American past and experience which I had not been exposed to before.  The cinematography is also well done.  The clothes of the characters and language were authenic.  It is a must see for anybody and everyone.  After watching the movie, I was so moved.",1023321600,2,382,4.890625
1903782,5,B0000A5A11,"My daughter and I thought that Feast of all Saints was an excellent dipiciton of history.  The tales of those women lives should be shared with all women of color.  We were truly touched by their stories and look forward to seeing it again. It is sure to be a new classic, it posesses the quality of histrionic art a true comparison of quality to other films such as, Roots, Queen and Beloved.",1019520000,2,393,4.36986301369863
1903783,5,B0000A5A11,"This Showtime Original Movie should have been released on the big screen.  The actors were as convincing as the cast of Gone With The Wind, and most performances were Oscar worthy. I'm not a a free person of color, but I love stories relating to other peoples' history.  The only drawback was casting Peter Gallagher asPhillipe.  I would have chosen someone with blond hair and fair skin, since both Marcel and Marie's coloring would not have been so fair if they had Peter Gallagher and Cecile's skin chemistry and hair color.  I watch the video whenever I can relax on a rainy weekend day.  If you want to check out the whole background, read Ann Rice's book first, it explains everything.",1012262400,3,691,4.677685950413223
1903784,5,B0000A5A11,"I can't wait for the relase of this Mini-series on Video. I, too, am interested in the world of the Free People of Color. It is a part of History that is seldom explored or told. Though Anne Rice's work is fiction, it does have ""secondary"" historical significance.",1009843200,2,264,4.520833333333333
1903785,5,B0000A5A11,"I thought this was a great movie and the book was even better. I think the reason i liked it so much was because, in history they tell the horrible story about slavery all the time. Never letting people know that there was people of color with riches and lived just like the white man. That's why i like the story of gens de couleur - the free people of color so much. It brings a fresh opening to a great history of people.",1007596800,2,424,4.059523809523809

1903787,5,B0000A5A11,"I love this movie - saw it before I read the book, it's better than the tragedy that is Queen of the Damned, but since it was a miniseries they had time to go dropped. Dolly Rose is made a contemporary of Cecile instead of Kristopher, and they make up her tragic marriage story the reason she is resigned to the life of supporting plaage. It must be to take the place of Cecile's relationship to her ""aunt's"" who are aging in the book but love frivolously off the gifts of suitors and await the fruits of Marie's introduction to society and a wealthy plaage match.  In my opinion the could've cut Dolly out and left the aunts. The movie could've touched on the hot bed of racial tension in New Orleans at the time, as it was becoming a US territory and backdrop of the familial and cultural issues. The movie omits Mr. Lermontant's legal dispute with an American Southerner who attacks him at his house, as well as delve deeper into the flight of Creole men to France who remain and  ""passe Blanc"" if they can or just make a better life.",1503705600,,1037,4.34020618556701

1903789,5,B0000A5A11,"This is a great mini series.  I saw this on SHO years ago and taped it.  I am glad it is on DVD. This is the type of series that you can watch over and over again.  The clothes and sets are wonderful, and it has many famous actors.  There are stories within stories.  This is about a part of history that most people do not know about. This set comes with two discs and it is about four hours long.",1498435200,2,398,3.8641975308641974

1903795,2,B0000A5A11,"What a disappointment.  Having enjoyed the book many years ago, I ran across the reviews of this television mini-series now on DVD and purchased it.  In a word...horrible! It is a two DVD set and my husband and I agreed to stop watching after the first disc.  Such a waste of what could have been a fascinating tale of a moment in our country's sordid history of slavery. Some of our greatest black actors were just wasted.  Maybe time to try it again?  It makes me wonder if maybe Anne Rice's book wasn't as good as I remember.  But my recommendation is, don't waste your time or money on this cheesy mess.",1482364800,,607,4.375

1903801,5,B0000A5A11,"As a longtime fan of Anne Rice novels I was pleasantly pleased by this adaption to film. The characters are true to the novels portrayals. The story is set as a juxtaposition of differing classes of French Creole black and white races and the mixing between. Some are given freedoms that others are denied which allows a story of love, Sorrow and greed to play out to great effect. An amazing film.",1472947200,,398,4.541666666666667

1903808,4,B0000A5A11,"Well-acted TV movie with great production values. It's on two discs, so I'm not sur of the running time, but suffice it say that it is over the typical 90-105 minute running times. It is well-paced and doesn't seem overly long. My only quibble is the accents. That may be what a Creole accent is supposed to sound like, but it it is difficult to understand the dialogue sometimes.",1451260800,,380,4.521739130434782

I would recommend this to anyone that wants to know more about history, the true history of what life was like. Though the characters are fictional, actions, lifestyles, and behaviors of those characters are very true to life for the early to mid 1800's in New Orleans.",1441670400,,471,4.552941176470588

1903821,3,B0000A5A11,I read the book and really liked it despite it being a very detailed and not easy read. I had high hopes for the movie. It's based on an excellent story and had big actors. Problem is it seemed a little over acted and melodramatic. Almost cartoonish.  It's good if you're a big fan of the book. If you haven't read the book don't judge it on this.,1431907200,,347,4.102941176470588

This movie if taken not just for entertainment value could help reshape our self view as a people and bring a cultural sense of pride and comradery to African Americans.

1903884,5,B0000A5A11,"...And as that is the limit of my middle school French, the rest of this review will have to be in English!  ;-)

""The Feast of All Saints"" is a very solid adaptation of the novel of the same name, by Anne Rice.  I was already a huge fan of Ms. Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches novels when I discovered TFOAS.  As a young ""Yankee"" African-American girl, I was immediately surprised and fascinated by the discovery of the 'gens de couleur libres,' or 'free people of color,' a large, prosperous Creole population descended from the French and their African slaves in antebellum New Orleans.  Though it took me a few tries to make it all the way through the heavy book (I was about 12 when I first tried), I ultimately fell in love not only with Ms. Rice's gorgeous prose, but the strange, privledged, oppressed, beautiful and tragic world of the gens de couleur libres.  I would now rate this novel as one of my top 5 favorites books ever.

TFOAS takes place in 1840s New Orleans and primarily centers around the teenaged Marcel Ste. Marie, the son of a wealthy French planter and his elegant Creole mistress of African and French descent.  Though clearly illegitimate, Marcel and his sister are provided for very generously by their father.  In fact, Marcel is very dependent on this man for everything and believes that he is entitled, particularly to the Holy Grail of well-to-do American men of color: a Paris education, which he dreams of day and night.  In Paris, a Negro man is just a man, with no racist laws or crippling prejudices to stop him from seizing the world.

This story tells of Marcel's coming-of-age, what he is taught of the world as a child of priviledge, and what he (often painfully) learns as Truth as the blinders of wealth and entitlement are slowly ripped away.

The whole film is beautifully done.  The costumes and hair alone are DAZZLING!!  It is all very historically accurate and really transports you to 1820s and 1840s New Orleans and its countryside.  It's true that for a Showtime presentation, it may now be considered a bit sub par.  This is most evident in the opening battle scene that depicts the Haitian Revolution of 1804. Though it is pretty impressive, it seems a little cartoonish compared to what Showtime can now do. Production values have come a long, long way since then!

The actors are wonderful.  The casting in this film is amazing!  As far as big names go, we have Ben Vereen, Peter Gallagher, Gloria Reuben, Jasmine Guy, Eartha Kitt, Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Beals, Ruby Dee, James Earl Jones and the incomparable Ossie Davis, just for starters! The younger actor and actresses also do well.  Yes, some are better than others.  This film also uses accents, and, well, some actors do their accent well, some absolutely nail it, and others are pretty terrible.  But hey kudos to all of them for trying, especially the younger ones.

Robert Ri'chard was wonderful in the role of Marcel. Not only was he exactly a physical manifestation of what I imagined him to be (honey skin, blue eyes, African-textured blond hair) but he did a very good job of expressing Marcel's exuberance, moodiness and intellectual curiosity.

Bianca Lawson was also wonderful in the role of Annabella Monroe.  She is a beautiful actress who did a great job at expressing Annabella's sensible, sweet, down-to-earth nature as well as her quiet, dignified strength and defiance against society's expectation of her.

Though I enjoyed Daniel Sunjata's depiction of Christophe Mercier (Daniel is absolutely gorgeous to look at..that helps!), I didn't think it was complete.  This is most likely the fault of the writers, but on film we get plenty of Christophe's intellectual,gentleman-to-his-fingertips image, but we do not get to see the darker, slightly unhinged, non-conformist side to Christophe's nature that was so evident in the novel.  Christophe was very much a part of the gens de couleur society, but at the same time he saw through the facade and was equally depressed and amused by what he saw.  We don't really see this in the film, unfortunately.

Gloria Reuben was great as Marcel's mother, the beautiful yet internally ugly Cecile Ste. Marie.  As her carefully crafted financial support starts to unravel, Ms. Reuben does a great job at expressing Cecile's self-righteous anger and selfish sacrifice of her own children's happiness.

And the late, great Ossie Davis IS Jean Jacques.  It is such a thrill to see this fine actor perform.  Mr. Davis's character has a small but a very important role, describing his 1st person account of the Haitian Revolution...and, for the first time, causing young Marcel to question things that he's been told.

As an African-American woman, I love to see other women of African descent portrayed beautifully, and this film  is full of dark beauty! The actresses glow in this film, representing all hues from ivory to deep walnut.  They truly do justice to the legendary power of seduction that the free women of color possessed!  :-)

As you can tell by my ridiculously long review, I really enjoy this film!  I am so glad it was made!  I would have liked some of my favorite scenes from the novel included in the film (the funeral of Dolly Rose's child; the first conversation of Marcel and Christophe, where Christophe is in a tree and Marcel in a cemetery; the beautiful, mad Juliet Mercier cursing out a carriage driver and hurling her cat into his face!), but it is still a pretty faithful adaptation of an important book, in my mind.

Highly recommended!  :-)

1903888,5,B0000A5A11,"I first saw this movie some years back. I think it was in 2003 when it first came out and I was like Whoa! Me being a light skinned black male myself, it was really interesting because a lot of what these people went through I've had to go through. Not considered white but not completely being accepted by some black people either. It was an eye opener because I never knew this sub-culture existed. And certainly not back in the 1800's. I love timepieces anyway so any movie that takes place in the past (from the 1980's on back) is instantly gonna grab my attention. Not to mention there were some really hot girls in this movie. I never knew there were a group of free blacks that lived during that time, and quite a large number of them from what the movie portrayed. In a way they still weren't free. They had the illusion of freedom and they weren't treated the same as the dark skinned blacks but they were still slaves just the same. Their whole existence was dependent on their acceptance by white men. The women had to do degrading acts with men they wouldn't even give a second look at in today's time. Some of those women would do anything to please the white men that ""took care of them"". I guess to them it was a means of survival. It was all they knew and if these men didn't financially support them they'd be poor and destitute. The fact that the whole thing was accepted was sickening to me. These white men could do things with these Creole women they could never do with white women. It was accepted as long as he ""provided"" for her. But he would never have the guts to cross the line and marry her. He took great care to make sure white society at large didn't know about his ""secret"" relationship with a black woman. The Creole men were free in the sense that they had enough pride not to depend on white men. Many of them went to school or learned trades to support themselves. They were groomed from an early age to be independent because the're families knew they obviously couldn't be consorts for white men unless the white man was gay. And what real man would want to depend on another man to take care of him and be bound to do sexual acts for him. They also knew they had no chance of marrying a wealthy white woman because white women at that time wouldn't be seen with a black man. At least not openly. So for them the independent route was the only option and the best route for any real man in my opinion. It was still unfair that dark skinned males were doomed from birth to a life of back breaking labor and servitude. They had no chance for an education or a chance to fullfill their own dreams and live their lives the way they wanted. Many of these men simply wanted freedom. A lot of them had no desire for having a white woman or even a Creole woman because they loved the black women who they were already bonded with. Some white and Creole women resented this because they felt they were entitled to have liberties with any black man they wanted especially dark skinned men because they were at the bottom of society. For him to choose his African woman over them infuriated them. Some of them would use their power or influence to try and separate the man from his black woman or even go so far as to have the woman whipped or killed to eliminate the competition and try to have him for themselves or just for revenge. Most of these dark skinned black men simply wanted freedom and a lot of them were content with starting their own families and living off the land as free men. Many would pick isolated locations as far from whites as they could get where they could grow their own food and live in harmony with their families and with the land. I respect both the light skinned men who went out in the world and learned skills and trades to support themselves and the dark skinned black men who earned their freedom and lived an independent life with their families as farmers of the land. Neither of them wanted to be dependent on the white man but sadly a lot of these men both light and dark skinned were met with cruelty and hatred. Especially if they became more successful than their white counterparts. Some of these Creole women were smart and chose to be with a black man rather live a life in the shadows waiting for some white man. I think many people should see this movie to know the other side of slavery.",1338595200,,4366,4.325609756097561

1903893,5,B0000A5A11,"My journey to find out about my black heritage started when I was working as an enumerator for the census in 2010, I came across this woman who kindly invited me into her home and when I started asking her about race, she laughed as she informed me of her many ethnicities. She did not want to be labeled as just a black woman, but a woman of color. This woman came into my area because she was an evacuee from  Hurricane Katrina. She was still very bitter and angry at how she, her family, and her fellow neighbors were horribly treated by our government. Her testimony nearly brought me to tears. This woman was of Creole descent, and she lived in the area where the story took place. New Orleans was a melting pot of rich culture. Unfortunately, Hurricane Katrina also washed this history away. Because the people, the root of the city are no longer there, can't back there, or don't want to return especially since they were treated so horribly and still are. The New Orleans of today is no longer how it was preKatrina just a commercial area for tourism. Anyway, this free woman of color was the one who told me about the free people of color, the Creoles, the quadroon balls where white men met women of color. Out of everything I learnt from her that day, she told me about the book by Anne Rice and the movie.
The books was great and big like most of Anne Rice's books are. For a white woman, Rice did an excellent job of protraying this period of time without being judgmental.
Even though the movie was not as detailed as the book for obvious reasons, I still give it five stars because it was an excellent ensemble of some of our greatest black actors like James Earl Jones, Rudy Dee, the late Eartha Kitt, the late Ossie Davis, Gloria Ruben, Jasmine Guy, Jennifer Beals, Pam Grierand the list goes on. Even the white actors like Peter Gallegher and Jenny Cooper did a good job. It was a great movie, great story, great cast and beautiful music. My only problem is that they did not make Christophe character as badass as he was in the book. Yet, anyway, it was a great movie that I love to watch every once in a while when I have four hours to spare. It would make you laugh, cry, think, smile, angry, and feel so many other emotions. It is a complex story with a great message.",1320278400,4,2290,4.350467289719626

1903895,5,B0000A5A11,"The first time I saw this movie, I was spellbound.  It was premiered on Showtime about ten years ago, and the memory of the production remained in my head for years.  And I always vowed I would get a copy of the dvd whenever it was released.  Recently finding out on Amazon.com that it was released, I didn't waste any time ordering my own copy.  I am an avid movie watcher and I am in the process of collecting every movie I love.  I know this arduous task is gonna take years to do, but ""Feast Of All Saints"" is on my personalized ""Favorite Top 400 Movies"" list.  It actually ranks number 10.........after such favorites as ""Driving Miss. Daisy"", ""Mahogany,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""the Notbeook,"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"" (in that order). And after seeing ""Feast Of All Saints"" after so many years, I'm beginning to wonder if it shouldn't be higher on my list.

Ann Rice did a superb job of telling this unforgettable story.  I have not read the book, but I was totally familiar with her partiality to the Creole lifestyle and language.  I have always enjoyed time-pieces in movies and ""Feast Of All Saints"" ranks right up there with the very best like ""Roots"" and the multi Oscar-nominated ""The Color Purple.""  It's a shame how movies come and go right before our eyes.  As soon as a movie is premiered these days, there are soon locked away on a shelf, especially if it wasn't a hit.  Or even if it were a hit, sometimes the movie is over-exposed and still get lost in the past.  I wish there was a mini-series channel on cable where all the great mini-series could be viewed, just by checking your local listings.  And although I now own the dvd, I would still watch ""Feast Of All Saints"" on the Mini-Series Channel just for the commarderie.

The cast of the movie was excellent.  I found it a joy to have the amazing and late Eartha Kitt apart of this ensemble.  I'm pretty sure this was probably one of her last major performances before her death. And I'm sorrowed that we've lost her when she was still a major force and one of the last pioneers of black cinema and Hollywood as a whole.  The film also includes the performing expertise of Oscar-nominee, Rudy Dee, and her late husband, Ossie Davis.  Their paths did not cross in the film.  But just to see them together again for the umpteenth time in a film was a joy also.  It's a shame that Miss. Dee's role was pretty quick and concise. An immediate smile comes to my face whenever she comes on screen.

Another one of my favorites was the star himself: Richard Ri'chard. He did an excellent job portraying the innocent, often-times unlearned main character. I could go on about this movie.  There were so many superb moments that are embedded in my heart. Another one of my favorites was Jasmine Guy from the ""A Different World"" comedy series. It was nice seeing her in another genre different from which she made popular.  I've always enjoyed a good drama piece and ""Feast Of All Saints"" does that in a superb way.  Some of the storylines are a little nerving to some who may not be used to strong subject matter.  But, nonetheless, it adds to the in-dept look of the past and the taboo subject of the other world of voodoo-ism.  If you are thinking of buying this dvd, you will not be disappointed.  It's a full 3 1/2 hours of good fun and a history lesson about another world that we may not be accustomed to. Thank you, Ann Rice!!!!!!",1313798400,4,3421,4.474193548387097

1903897,4,B0000A5A11,"I had never heard of this movie but after reading some really positive reviews I decided to check it out. When I first started the movie, within 15 minutes I wanted to turn it off. I was so annoyed and disgusted with some of the comments made by the Creole characters concerning the black slaves. But I'm actually glad I didn't turn it off. Once you get into the background of the characters, you realize that what you see at first glance is not really who they are.

Under the system of placage, Cecile St. Marie gives birth to two children, Marcel and Marie, with her white caretaker Philippe. Marcel and Marie grow up with a seemingly privileged existence. However, viewers will soon realize that their privileged existence is littered with the same heartbreak, suffering, and dehumanization experienced by the black slaves. The story chronicles 3 generations of ""colored"" Creoles. While Cecile is dependent on placage for her livelihood, her daughter Marie is determined to not be subjected to such a system and to marry for love, regardless of the consequences. Marcel grows up with dreams of being educated in Paris where he will become a ""true gentleman"" but he is soon hit with the harsh reality that even though his family is not being sold on the auction block, there is actually very little that separates him from the slaves that his family always told him were beneath him and he must learn to find his identity not only in his Creole heritage, but in his African ancestry as well.

The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because I felt that the writers didn't take advantage of the talent of this truly superior cast. Also, some of the scenes are really poorly shot especially the love scene with Anna Bella and the gentleman that she was promised to. I just wish that the movie dug deeper into the stories of these characters and was not so focused on Marcel because even though Robert Ri'chard did a decent job of portraying the character, he was often overshadowed by the other actors whose talents were simply superior.

1903903,3,B0000A5A11,"I recently saw this movie and I actually was entertained. I think the movie leaves you with more questions than answers. More importantly as a viewer you are lulled into complacency regarding a rather evil epoch of history in this country. As a African American man I was actually offended by the "" Gens de Couleur Libre "" Free Men Of Color. Imagine, mixed race Black men and women in 1822 , who lived in this limbo world where they were 2nd class citizens on one hand (to white folks) but better than Black folks. Kind of like the colored people of South Africa during apartheid.
  The interesting point that must be made is that this movie is really about "" insanity "" and the levels of insaneness that people of color adjust and adapt , in order to live in an insane world.
  Imagine a society where mixed race mothers dressed up and contractually sold their daughters to white men for property, money and fake social status, in order to be a mistresses. The definition of this was called "" Placage "" This is amazing and unfanthomable, but it's real history. These events were very similiar to the debutante balls of modern times.
This movie is worth viewing, but make sure and take a shower after watching it and make yourself a  stiff drink.
  Last point, I do think the author Anne Rice ( of the vampire fame ) made a unnecessary and very flawed decision in depicting Vodoun or VooDoo religion as inherently evil. In light of the world these folks lived , I thought practicing a traditional African religion might be the only slice of reality these people ever experienced.",1261872000,3,1579,4.5583038869257955

When I first saw this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana. It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too technical. All the principle characters  all had straight teeth and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong. It wasn't even French

No live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern Louisiana. The supporting actors and actresses were quite good. Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white master would leave them property and money. Not so in other southern states. The more beautiful the woman, the more she would receive from the white man.

Although most of the actors are very good-looking, their delivery is wooden, and the dialog they are given is wooden, and plotwise it looks like they exist only to jump into bed with each other.

1903938,5,B0000A5A11,"My take on Anne Rice's Feast of All Saints

A beautiful movie about America's least known group of People in Antebellum Louisiana, Gens de Colour. As a woman of African, American Indian, and White ancestry, I've always been fascinated by those people in New Orleans who formed an aristocracy unto themselves and were free. They have their rituals, customs, and amusements such as the famous Quadroon Balls. They have rights and freedoms that most blacks and multiracials, slave and free, in antebellum America didn't have, yet they were not completely free because the power elite of that time didn't want to share power with the free people of color. They may conduct business with them, but refuse to invite them to their houses for dinner or social function.

Anne Rice has done an excellent job telling the story through the eyes of young Marcel, who came of age at 17, was promised by his absentee father an education abroad. However, because of the racism and jealousy of the Ferronaire family as well as the economic troubles at Bontemps, he was denied his lifelong dream of going there to pursue his prestigious education at the Sorbonne. He took matters in his own hands and went to the plantation where his father lives and was forbidden by his father to visit there. It was there where Marcel was brutally whipped and kicked by his own his father, in the presence of his estranged wife and children. What man would abuse his own flesh and blood? It has to be motivated by race and class: Marcel must learn his place in the white world of 19th-Century Louisiana. He learned it the hard way through the denial of privileges his absentee father enjoy as well as his humiliation and abuse by M. Ferronaire. He now learned that he must cast his allegience to people of color, whose lives have been shaped by society's limitations and its racist, classist behavior and ritual. Also, Marcel learned more about slavery, the war in Saint Domingne(Now Haiti), the limitations placed upon free people of color, the slave status of his half sister Lisette, who has the same father as he:  she was the product of a liaison between Ferronaire and Zazu, a very handsome black slave woman from the Ferronaire plantation.  He was upset at his mother for being ignorant of history, for her adopted mother brought her from Saint Domingue during the war of independence from France and like Lisette, a product of a liaison between a rich white planter and a beautiful black slave mother who is unnamed in both novel and film adaptation.

His mother's insane devotion to her absentee protector didn't help Marcel's recent problems, yet he must leave his family to live at his schoolteacher's house or else they lose monetary and material support from M. Ferronaire. Humiliated and hurt, Marcel offer himself to him, but Mercier refuses, citing his childish dependency upon others, especially by those whom didn't truly love him. His father was a prime example.

The free multiracial women of New Orleans were in a very precarious position. While they were praised for their ""exotic"" beauty, they weren't allow to marry white men. Pernicious class prejudices made it difficult to marry free multiracial men for that meant lower social status. Some of the women chose convent life, but even that is out of the question for most of them. So they settle into a lifestyle of their mothers: That being a well-kept mistress of a white man. Only certain white men qualify. He has to be wealthy, refined, educated, and of the upper class. Those women wouldn't settle for less. Case in point: The argument between Cecile Ste Marie and her daughter over her daughter's position. When Cecile's daughter Marie chose to be married to Monsieur de Lemontant's son, she was very furious at her  choice, for she is expected to follow her mother in the tradition of having a wealthy, refined white man as her protector. She recently lost her lover in death who didn't bother to leave her family any provision in the event of his passing. Marcel's exile in San Souci and her daughter's pursuit of Richard Lemontant didn't help her current financial woes. She summon her long-neglected daughter to discuss about the situation and for her to accept placage, which her daughter consider it another form of slavery in a gilded cage without the benefits of marriage. They had a very heated argument over it that caused her mom to summon her less than respectable friend, Dolly Rose to her house to help Marie to see that her decision of marrying Richard isn't in her mom's best interest. She steadfast held to her position which led to disasterous consequences afterwards.

I couldn't forgive Cecile St. Marie for the neglect of her daughter, indifferent to the suffering her son had at the hands of his callous and insensitive father, the brutal rape of her daughter, and the suicide of their half-sister Lisette after the incident at the voodoo brothel. He finally found peace with his people, gens de colour libre at the end of the movie. He decides to become a photographer and to work with the people in his hometown instead of studying abroad. He also found renewed love from Anna Bella Monroe played by Bianca Lawson from ""Save the Last Dance."" Anna Bella emerge as the stronger character in all of this and much more, even with the placage with Aglae's brother and eventual abandonment by him. He didn't left her in poverty, for he left her the house along with all the possessions as well as lifelong monetary support which Philippe didn't do for the Ste. Marie family.

I wish Americans know more of this least-known group of people andstop the unnecessary divisions among the human race. America needs to acknowlege their ties to one another, that racial/ethnic category terms such as ""blacks"" and ""whites"" are just artificial social categories design to keep people apart and resentful of one another. We are one people regardless of our various racial and ethnic origins.

I recommend this movie to those who want to know the whole truth about American history instead of the doctored version parroted by the media and educational system.",1100736000,38,6116,4.838432122370937

I've read several books about the subject and seen (I thought) all the movies about slavery in America.  I'm glad that Anne Rice wrote the novel and allowed the movie to be made from her book, otherwise, I wouldn't have known about this part of American history.  This movie moved me so much because I could identify with the characters of mixed heritage and I think every American of all races should see this movie.

In America we still have problems, but not like the ones that existed during Slave time.  I've seen this movie 6 times during 2003.  It's one that I know I will be watching again and again.

1903941,4,B0000A5A11,"Anne Rice has had a troubled history with her books turning into films.  Unrecognizable adaptations of EXIT TO EDEN and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED are more frequent than quality films such as INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE.  Here you have a half and half treatment of a novel that dealt with people who were half black and half white!  Parts of it are true to the novel and its characters, and then parts will leave you scratching your head wondering where they got something.  Anne Rice should step in more often and make sure these things are done right, but alas ... this one is close!
Pretty pretty sets, costumes, and actors bring to life a story of racial identity crisis in the South of the 1800s.  New Orleans before the slaves were free had a third race of people who were neither black and slaves nor white and truly free.  They lived on a fringe of society, and had to arrange their lives carefully or pay for the consequences.  Educated bohemians they became the basis for the creoles!
It's an oft ignored subject of American history, and a beautiful story told in rich detail.  The book has the luxury of its own pacing, and here the movie has to step quickly to keep up!  So some of this feels rushed.  But they got the right people!  Famous black actors mix with unknowns, and they all come out fine and noble.

After reading this book about 6 years ago, I became very passionate about it being made into a film. When I heard finally that they were going make the film and how perfectly they cast the roles I became obsessed with seeing it. Yesterday when I finally saw it (I did not have Showtime when it came out), I felt they rushed it like a bad pornography. We learned too early in the film what Lisette's relationship to Marcel was or why Richard needed Marcel to ""be a brother"" to Anna Bella. They definitely did not capture the importance of Christophe to the entire society .I personally felt that they only needed the talented James Earl Jones at the very end and perhaps in the beginning.
EVERY actor in this film has proven thier talent over and over again in other films yet I think with the rushed dialouge they were not given the opportunity to show the talent they usually have. Each actor , later in the movie, had moments where they shone, but only Eartha Kitt , as usual, stood out from the moment that you saw her.
It amazes me to this day that Americans of all backgrounds still pretend that people of color, no matter how light they are, have no connection with the ""white"" people of this country. I had hoped that this movie would be so powerful that it would make all of us think. I think this was a good movie, but not as great as it could be.

1903947,5,B0000A5A11,"This movie was soooooo accurate ! I definately enjoyed it. I actually saw the movie first and THEN i bought the book. Man, when i tell you they stuck to the script to the ""T"". Most movies will improvise & add things that weren't in the original book. This movie didn't do that. The casting was perfect as well. All the charectors portrayed in the movie were the exact visuals i pictured when i read the book.....well, with the exception of Gloria Reuben as Cecile, who's charector was supposed to be more petite. Minor descrepencies like that were far over looked and i thought the cast was great, the story line was splendid and i thoroughly enjoyed both the book & the movie. I had the pleasure of taping the movie but part of it was erased on accident, which is another incentive for the movie being a retailed item. I would be unable to over tape it ! I loved the costumes and the way the cast held their accents with such grace. It was awesome.
A definate must see if you like historic facts about African Americans in the US. This story uncovers a lot of unknown truths about our people and is extremely entertaining. I give it 2 thumbs up !!!!",1037664000,5,1150,4.378504672897196
