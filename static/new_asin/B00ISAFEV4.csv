6290641,5,B00ISAFEV4,"It's more about honor and vales than it is about Spain. The dialogue is a little stilted and pretentious, but these are very minor faults compared to the message of the film. I highly recommend it.",1402272000,7,197,4.5
6290642,4,B00ISAFEV4,"This probably will speak more to a generation that is now leaving the scene, but for whom the Civil War in Spain and fascism were life and death matters. Peck is ok, and so is Quinn: serviceable performances. I liked Omar Sharif here, who really seemed to convey some emotion, as opposed to sneering or growling, which Peck and Quinn do a lot of. Still, it's a good evening's entertainment if you're of a certain age. Probably not if you below a Gen X'er.",1402099200,6,455,4.428571428571429

8644960,4,B00ISAFEV4,"The film gives some insight into the scars left by the Spanish Civil War.  I found it entrancing because I lived in the area where the action takes place, at the time the action takes place.  It could have been a lot better, though.",1453766400,,232,4.25
