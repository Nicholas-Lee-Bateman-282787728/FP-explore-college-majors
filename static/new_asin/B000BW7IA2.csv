8561920,3,B000BW7IA2,"I did not learn that much new from this DVD, apart from some useful moves during the cool-down (called here ""warm-down""). There is about 55 minutes of workout (including warm-up and cool-down) and quite a lot of utterly disposable bonus features, like ""Behind the Scenes"" or ""Team Profiles"" (where one of the instructors is showing her kitchen and another is going through her collection of hip scarves). The music is really boring. And what is ""Oz Style""? I think it means that all the demonstration takes place on the beach, somewhere in Australia I presume. I quite like that -- you almost expect a great white shark or something among the bathers on the background -- although the camerawork is not that great. Apparently, the cameraman is rather fond of Dutch angles, which, according to Wikipedia, are ""often used to portray the psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed"". Not the best choice for a dance fitness or, for that matter, any instructional video (unless it is the one on Dutch angle techniques). As much as I enjoy looking at the girls with very little clothes on, it would be better if the camera stayed focused on the instructors. Also, as the DVD is aimed at the beginner, one would expect a bit more of basic movement breakdown.",1325635200,,1272,4.786363636363636
