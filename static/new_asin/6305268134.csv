1006744,5,6305268134,I AM FAN OF STEVE VAI. HE IS THE BEST GUITARIST OF THE WORLD LOSING ONLY FOR JOE SATRIANI.,955065600,,90,3.789473684210526
1006745,5,6305268134,"Like all great ideas this DVD concept is both simple and effective.  It contains all seven songs from the corresponding CD and features Steve mimicking his live performance for the cameras.  A variety of different  clothes, guitars, and skin colours (!) all help to sustain visual  interest.
The picture quality is average, but the sound is so great  you'll soon have the neighbors banging on your walls!  The DVD also  contains a few extra gubbins and as well as Steve's audio commentary also  includes multiple camera angles, a short interview and a useful  programmable playing order.
Although some people have criticised this as  an MTV style performance, it is very representative of Steve's live show  and ultimately shows many close ups of his unfeasibly dextrous digits  performing dazzling fretboard gymnastics!
The DVD itself is only 40  minutes long, although cheap in the first place, and is worthy of many  repeated plays.
As stated above the concept of this DVD is startling  effective and obviously cheap to produce, and yet still makes good use of  the DVD as a platform.  The gauntlet has now been thrown down to the likes  of Satriani, Gilbert, and Petrucci, so don't be shy boys, just go for it!",953942400,,1214,4.896551724137931
1006746,3,6305268134,"There is no mistaking that Vai is the best guitarist out there - hands down. There is also no mistaking MTV has ruined any video presentation of today's music. Vai could have easily plugged in and played it live, instead  of playing along with the playback. Believe me - he could do it. I find it  fustrating when capable artists coast; when a magnificent visual production  could've been a reality. And what a marketing concept; buy the CD and hear  it polished & perfect, buy the video and see it live, raw and playable  - as opposed to merely a studio product.",940032000,5,563,4.480392156862745
1006747,3,6305268134,"When I ordered this dvd I was expecting more than just 3 guys mimicking all the songs. It looked to me it was done in some local bar minus the audience. The video angle was nothing great, but another boring shot of  steve. No doubt Steve Vai is a awesome guitar player but you won't miss  anything but just buying the CD.",936144000,6,321,4.161290322580645
1006748,5,6305268134,"Vai is wicked. I have always loved him because he never ceases to be original. The man can do some serious fingerwork. He gave me his autograph at the Rose Bowl when I was around twelve years old and visiting  California. I will NEVER forget that. That was extremely cool of him. The  silver getup is strange, and the song with his little boy is endearing. The  DVD was clean and crisp visually, and the sound was great. There are extra  features, such as the ability to program the song order, a mini-interview,  short but concise biography, a complete discography, and different angles  for four songs. In other words, this DVD should have costed well over the  price I paid for it. His undulating sexy body wrapped around that guitar  sure was worth my $15!
SONGS INCLUDE: Bad Horsie/ Juice/ Die to Live/ The  Boy From Seattle/ Ya-Yo Gak/ Kill the Guy With the Ball/ Tender Surrender",934675200,4,886,4.592356687898089
1006749,4,6305268134,"If you like Vai it is well worth the money even with the poor quality of the video transfer.  Basically a collection of performance videos for all the songs.  DVD also contains an audio track with Steve explaining each of  the songs (inspirations, etc.) along with some other cool features.  I just  wish they would have spent a little more time and money to get a killer  video track to go along with the killer audio.",918000000,2,419,4.447368421052632

1006823,3,6305268134,"I don't know what Steve Vai was thinking with this collection of video performances of each of the songs from Alien Love Secrets. Tthe album is one of my favorites, possibly his best but this video is a huge disappointment.  The picture quality is grainy at best and looks like an old seventies porn film.  Steve Vai and the band wear the blue/silver make-up he wears on the cover of the album.  They looked silly.  The lighting and sets are dismal.  There isn't a set to speak of they just perform in front of black cloth backgrounds.
I saw the G3 concert after Eric Johnson left and Kenny Wayne Sheppard had joined them.  Steve was by far the most dynamic on stage and this video captures that which is a plus, although some of the faces he makes are pretty goofy.  The performances are entertaining though.
The extras weren't bad and the sound quality was as good as the CD.  The band is obviously playing to dubbed music which was really distracting and felt a little phony, but Steve uses quit a few instruments and over dubs on the albums so it's probably hard to perform the songs live.
This isn't a bad DVD but it isn't up to Steve Vai's usually perfectionist standards.  I would only recommend it to Steve Vai fans who want a complete collection.  I'm looking forward to seeing something with better production qualities.",990316800,6,1330,4.550420168067227
1006824,4,6305268134,I can't complain about this one. Why? Because of how cheap it is. The audio is great and the video (something no CD has) gives you the chance to see Steve at work. So what if he's only guitar-synching.,986688000,,201,4.17948717948718
1006825,3,6305268134,"I will start this by saying that I am a huge Steve Vai fan. I own all of his CDs and have been listening to his music since 1986. That being said, I would caution anyone to preview a copy of this DVD before you purchase it.
The high points for me were the sound quality, and more importantly, hearing Steve describe his inspiration behind the songs. I would have liked to see more of this type of thing in the future. More of this information would have made the DVD longer and helped increase it's viewability over time.
The low points were the image quality, and the performance itself. Much of the time, the picture was slightly fuzzier than I have seen on other DVDs. It may have been a transfer problem, and it really surprised me knowing how Steve can be about production. The performance was mediocre at best. Many times I felt that they weren't really playing the songs when they were being video taped. The performance seemed a little fake and forced.
All in all, it's an average DVD. I know that Steve Vai is capable of better production than this. Hopefully his next production will be either a filmed concert or a strictly instructional one, rather than this type of studio DVD.",978480000,2,1190,4.488479262672811
1006826,4,6305268134,"This DVD was originaly designed so transcribers could see what he was actually doing with his fingers on certain parts. So it just sort-of evolved into a DVD. If you are interested in 'live' type of video, get the G-3 concert video. If however you want to see what his fingers are doing on very complicated solo's, well this DVD should do the trick. If you were going to buy the CD then this is a 'no brainer', since DVD's play as normal CD's as well.",976579200,,451,4.255813953488372

I am absolutely breathless watching this video! Yes the other reviewers are right about the fact that it isn't a live show. But check it closely, watch his fingers--he is playing in perfect synchronization to the music! Great cinematography! Great music! Great expression of PASSION AND PERSONALITY!!! Steve's the MAN!
All of the video clips are awesome but TENDER SURRENDER will knock any woman with blood running through her veins flat!! The man is hot! Pam is one lucky woman!
I would recommend to the major fans getting the DVD because it has interviews of Steve; the VHS does not. Also, watch this (either version VHS or DVD), until the end. There is a personal note from Steve.
I think he is awesome in this! I truly believe you will NOT be disappointed! Trust me please! Also, you have to get his newest CD, 7th Song: Enchanting Guitar as well as G-3 Live in Concert!

But I was a little upset by the fact that there was no warning whatsoever that the performances captured on this DVD were not live recordings. Three guys  making the motions whilst a CD is playing in the background is hardly fair  to fans who appreciate real music played on real instruments by real  people.  I know a lot of fans will jump on me hard for this but I consider  it an abomination for an artist who has yet been spoiled by the trappings  of the plastic pop world to produce such an effort. I only hope it was an  oversight and will never happen again.  Over the video release the DVD does  have the added optional feature of Vai's commentry over the tracks which is  sometimes insightful, but overall you are really not getting more than the  CD (which, by the way, is great)",963532800,4,857,4.196319018404908

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Love-Secrets/dp/B000JJSJMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Love Secrets</a>

I don't understand the guy that posts a 3 stars saying he is disappointed in the DVD. To balance his critique, I thought I'd share my view of it.

Steve is so on-point with his fingering, you will be hard-pressed to say he's not playing live; certainly only the most technical of guitarists can tell. The only beef I have there is that many of the licks I'd like to see him play are not always visible in at least one of the two video angles. But, that would be true of a REAL live performance as well; maybe even MORE so.

After reading this critique, I watched the drummer and bassist. They are on-point, too. Only a drummer or bassist, respectively, may find any discrepancy worth noting between the recorded tracks and their performance. None of the video performance is lacking to the point of distraction.

The reason I like this DVD so much is Vai is TOTALLY free to convey the mood of the songs with his expressions, his movements, his dancing, every aspect of these songs. Also, all of the licks are clean only as a studio can render them. The only thing I didn't like was knowing he did not use the exact guitars he played for each song in the studio in this video. I like visually equating the guitar with the sound I'm hearing.

Now, I'm no metalist ... my favorite was always Ernie Isley of The Isley Brothers. But, Steve Vai is so remarkable a player, I can't help but get into him, albeit, not so much the thrash as the more melodic and bluesey numbers he performs. I am suitably impressed by the metal virtuosity. However, my favorite tracks on this DVD/CD, in approximate order, are:

1. Boy From Seattle

I LOVE this piece! To me, the epitome of rhythm/lead comping throughout, then a straight-up pop-blues solo, moving into a melodic distorted/delayed pyro-solo, and wrapping up with a beautiful chord-laced ending. I just can't get enough of it!

2. Die to Live

A musical piece that makes the phrase ""music to my ears"" have poetic meaning! The other track I simply can't get enough! Though the whole thing uses distortion, the combination of lead resolving into rhythmic chords at just the right times makes my skin dance and my fingers roil! It's hard not to move and sway to this song as you imagine playing it as Steve does, with such intense feeling. This is another example of where his expressiveness takes the songs he plays to additional heights!

3. Tender Surrender

I know others probably like this song better than my first two choices, and understandably so! The Benson-style octave phrasing is off the chain! He finger-picks and swells each riff so perfectly and it is amazing! The bridge is a wonderful departure from the basic melody (as with Die to Live) and brings you back around to the main cliche in a very satisfying way. His ending is so apt to the title of the song and I can imagine the emotional collapse of two lovers at the end of having drunk deeply from each others ecstasy. Steve is phenomenal on this piece!

4. Bad Horsie

What can I say?! Metal for real, but funky and melodic, still. This has got to be a pick-squeal standard, here. The horse whinnying, the locomotive chugging along ... Steve reproduces it all in perfect rhythm. Truly amazing!

I am convinced and converted! Steve Vai will go down as one of the greatest guitarists of all time! I can't help but mention one other song that is a top pick I wish were in this collection: 'For the Love of God'. I know it's not included here, but this song is just as satisfying to me as the above four I've critiqued.

Many metalists will enjoy the other songs more, I'm sure. And I am duly impressed with Steve's performance on songs like Juice and Kill the Guy with the Ball/The God Eaters. Ya-Yo Gakk was a fun insert based on how he created it, but I don't listen to those over and over as I do the four I mentioned.

This CD and DVD are MUST-HAVES. I've bought them both for myself and even for a friend or two. TOTALLY AWESOME!!!",1261353600,,4160,4.616531165311653
7887193,5,6305268134,"ive watched the vhs version so many times now and still cant see that this was not a live show. (was it a live show? did steve actually split into 3 versions of himself on one of the songs?).
the sound quality is superb and the choreography is perfectly matched with the songs.

7887194,3,6305268134,"Steve Vai is untouchable, I love his playing and I consider Vayguy a true artist, one of the few in music biz. I'm a bit disappointed about this dvd because it is cheapily produced. The music is great, but if it was for the music we were talking about a cd. We're talking about a dvd instead so it's the video part that matters to me. It's cheap. And moreover the fact that it's not a live recording left me with a sort of bad taste. So they are videos and cheapily produced. In my opinion, you should buy this dvd only if you are in one of those moments when you want to buy something from the artist and you already have all the music he has recorded. As I did. It's funny in a certain sense but it's not the dvd you would expect from Steve. The three stars are only for the music which is caught between good and excellent. The dvd is really a lost opportunity to publish something really good and memorable. What a shame. Steve, I'll wait you next time with a lot better product. In a range from 1 to 10 I'd give Steve 10, music 7/8, dvd 4.",1052524800,4,1044,4.072815533980583
7887195,5,6305268134,"This is essentially the ""Alien Love Secrets"" album, which was recorded around 1994, with Steve Vai and his group lip/finger synching along with the music. Mr. Vai accurately and quite interestingly synchs along, as precisely as you'd expect from someone of his perfectionist qualities. Needless to say, while it's not an authentic performance of the songs, but rather a recording of the guys synching along with a prior recording, it's the next best thing.
  Not much else to comment on, as far as the performance is concerned. It takes place on one set, with Steve changing suits/skin colors (!!) between several of the tracks. His children even show up on ""Ya Yo Gakk"" and do silly things for the camera. The video transfer is pristine, and I have absolutely no qualms with it.
  Now, the extras. The commentary track with Mr. Steve Vai is quite entertaining, although there are dead points here and there where he gets caught up in the movie and doesn't say much. His stories and description of things are always good....you get the feeling that he's sitting there, talking to you specifically about the songs. There are also alternate angles for a couple of tracks, which is nice, but probably won't be accessed more than once or twice. A featurette made as a promotion for his 1996 Epic Records recording, ""Fire Garden"", lasts about roughly 7-8 minutes, and is fun to watch. A discography, pictures, and other small things round it all up.
  Although released pretty early on in the life of DVD technology, it remains one of the more fascinating and worth-while purchases of the musically-related DVD's that have been released up to this point in time. Steve Vai fans, guitar fans....I can't imagine you turning this one away.",1042329600,12,1731,4.870748299319728
