8229534,4,B000XSKDSS,"In a devastated world overrun by monstrous bugs and outlaws, Honoka is the protector of the innocent. She has a 6th sense for danger, sword skills that rock, and an A.I. tank that acts as her partner and home. She is ready to take on any job that her clients are willing to pay her for. While crossing the desert, she finds a man wandering alone. This man has a secret, and a mission that will change her life forever. Her skills are about to be tested like never before.

This anime is a lot better than I expected. I has good animation, voice acting, a unique story, and a pretty good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, adventure, and some pretty interesting characters & plot twists. There isn't another anime out there that I can really compare this to. It's pretty original, despite that, I still found it lacking a little something that would make it a 5 star show. It's hard to put my finger on what it is, but The Third is comes just shy of being incredible. Even so, it's still really good, and definitely worth watching. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1353974400,,1082,4.383084577114428
8229535,3,B000XSKDSS,"Technically, this volume wasn't entirely bad. It had a decent story, the characters were put into a strong struggle and two of the female characters were given screen time to mend a relationship and connect with the audience a little more. Sadly though, what the audience should be looking for is a primary plot and some kind of sign that their heroine is gearing up towards something climatic and exciting. With only two volumes left in the series, it's hard to imagine what this series is possibly going to come up for the final third of the series. With only eight episodes remaining in the series, it's difficult to think that the staff is going to come up with a story that will be introduced and ended within that time period while still having a maxiumum lasting impact with it's audience.

  I'm starting to grow really disappointed with the direction of this series but I'm going to continue to give it a recommendation in hopes that the final third (no pun intended) of the series really steps it up a notch.",1214092800,,1018,4.613259668508287
