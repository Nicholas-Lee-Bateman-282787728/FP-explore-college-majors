2130855,5,B0002WZTQQ,"Ok, this is even more extreme than Uncle Mel ever intended to be.

If you do not like satirical humour, directed at *everyone*, DO NOT buy or view this movie.

If you loved Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"", ""Meaning of Life"", or Mel Brooks triumphs such as the ""The Inquisition"" and ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical numbers, and other such wonderful potshots at people who take themselves WAY too seriously, then this is a movie for you.

I am very very happy that this is finally being released, just in time for some celebratory viewing during Hanukkah.",1096502400,41,552,4.729166666666667
2130856,4,B0002WZTQQ,"Tasteless in the tradition of Monty Python and Mel Brooks, a logical companion to ""Bad Santa"", this is one seriously funny film. If you are easily offended, just pass on this one. If you can stand everyone -- and I do mean everyone -- being mocked and insulted, then you are in for a side-splitting time.",1094169600,11,304,4.446428571428571
2130857,4,B0002WZTQQ,"This is quite probably the most offensive and vile movie I have ever seen, but I still loved it. The story follows a Jew on a mission to save Hanukkah from the evil Santa Claus, with the help of the Black Panthers (Defending Kwanza with extreme prejudice...), his mother, and his girlfriend (secretly in cohoots with his mother). Along the way he also manages to tangle with Nazi's and christmas movies (A Wonderful Life) trying to subvert young jews.

If you have a sense of humor and are willing to laugh at yourself, this will be a great movie you cant afford to miss. If you are easily offended, and have no room to laugh at blatant stereotypes and religious matters, this movie probably isn't for you. It also helps if you at least understand the Jewish Religion, as alot of the offensive/funny jokes are ""in jokes"" that only Jews will get.",1093824000,17,845,4.559210526315789

2130905,4,B0002WZTQQ,"It's camp! It's crazy! It's a must for people who love Jewish humor and especially for those who treasure Chanukah, even if it isn't a ""high holiday"" as the Hebrew Hammer's mother kvetches. The plot is simple and goofy, an attempt to save the holiday from a madman who would wipe out both Chanukah and Kwanzaa. The simplicity of the plot allows every Jewish joke in the book to star, so overdone, it is hilarious. (Think Mel Brooks's Spaceballs with an ethnic twist.) The ongoing gag that actually almost gagged me from laughter is the attempt of so many people in the film to properly pronounce the gutteral ""ch"" in Chanukah. My kind of movie--and frankly, much better than I expected after reading the blurb.",1462665600,3,710,4.688
2130906,4,B0002WZTQQ,"Perfectly Silly in the tradition of Mel Brooks.  Lots of ethnic jokes made in the spirit of good friends making fun of each other or Phyllis Diller making fun of herself.  It's rated R, but we really saw it as more of a PG13.  One scene had blood splatter.  There was no more nudity than you would see at the beach, but there was foreplay which faded to black and mention of a specific sexual act.  Words you might hear from Chris Rock, Samuel L Jackson or George Carlin were used moderately. Characters said some words that are offensive if used by a person outside the specific group: ""Gimp,"" ""K---,"" ""N---,"" usually affectionately, except when the clear villain used them.  Characters are largely one-dimensional, but this is not intended to be literature; it's goofy comedy.",1462492800,2,778,4.725925925925926

A shameless parody of the low-budget blaxplotation films of the 70s, this is one of the few films in which Judaism and, to a lesser extent, Pan-African faiths are presented as being more than just 'foreign religions' in the U.S.  Full of crude tropes and stereotypes, this playful movie ultimately advocates both intra-community strength and inter-community cooperation.

2130974,5,B0002WZTQQ,"Movies so stupid they're hilarious: ""The Hebrew Hammer"" is at the top of the list.  Aside from a few very vulgar moments with the Hammer's mother (note to Hollywood script writers:  it's possible to satirize a Jewish mother without being quite that gross), this movie is bound to make you giggle.  Hammer (in Hebrew, ""Maccabee"") is drafted, more or less against his will, to take on Santa Claus's evil son who is out to stamp out both Hanukkah and Kwanzaa so that Christmas will reign supreme as THE winter holiday.  To achieve his plan, the Evil Son starts by making some of the reindeer kill his father, Santa, so he can take over the North Pole.

An emergency meeting of a top level secret  and screamingly funny Jewish organization decides the only remedy to saving Hanukkah is to get the Hammer back in action.  The meeting chairman (""General Bloomenbergensteinenthal"") is a side-splitting version of Israeli General Moshe Dayan, eye patch and all, played superbly by Peter Coyote.  But this chairman has a beautiful daughter, predictably named Esther (Judy Greer).  She will help the Hammer save Hanukkah, along with Mario Van Peebles, who plays Kwanzaa's main man.  Why is help even needed?  Well, the Hammer goes into an anxiety attack every time somebody tries to tell him how important this mission is.  Then there's Evil Santa's secret weapon, which he plans to unleash upon The Hammer.  But I won't give it away, except to say that it's outrageously funny, even if occasionally the humor descends into unneeded vulgarity.  Most Americans know enough generally about Judaism to be able to get most of the amusing references in the film, but even if you don't, this one's a Don't Miss.

While it is full of stereotypes, it is done in a way to get laughs, and it is very much an homage to ""Shaft"" and other films of the 70s of the genre.  The Hebrew Hammer is a Jewish PI; he was bullied as a child when he went to a Catholic public school, and when he grew up, he dedicated himself to making life better for other Jews and doing what he could to help Jews be proud of who they are.  When a new Santa Clause takes over, one who is set on destroying Hanukkah, The Hammer joins forces with the Jewish Justice League and the Kwanzaa Liberation Force in order to save Hanukkah.

2131037,1,B0002WZTQQ,"Few truly clever and/or original jokes turns this film into a pointless parade of Jewish stereotypes.  Save your money and catch this stinker on Comedy Central - if you must, and only if you don't mind ""Girls Gone Wild"" commercials during each break.  Better yet, avoid altogether and catch the real laughs on South Park.  Mr. Hanke is far superior than anything found on this film!  Our Hebrew friends deserved better.",1104019200,8,419,4.859154929577465
2131038,5,B0002WZTQQ,"Let me be absolutely clear, this movie is HYS-TER-IC-AL!  In a world where the same three holiday movies are played over, and over, and over again in a complex form of brainwashing by our local networks, it was a pure delight to see something fresh, funny, and outstandingly original in the holiday film circuit.  Director Jonathan Kesselman has done his homework with this project.  By homework I mean watching ""cult"" classics like Hot Shots! and Airplane! while using a similar structure to develop his own unique blend of humor and satire.  While watching this you will be surprised at how little you see coming.  That is due to the fresh feel of this film.  We have not seen many films like it lately, it on all levels it worked.  It left me wanting more, oh so much more.

You can only credit the director for so much, it takes the talent from in front of the camera to really pull a film together.  The feeling that actors have when doing a project definitely comes through the screen and onto the audience.  Take Stepford Wives for example.  You could tell that Kidman had no excitement on doing this project, and it consequently was horrible.  I was never interested in Kidman's character because if she didn't care, why should I bother.  This was not the case with The Hebrew Hammer.  Goldberg was having a blast playing this zany yet kind character that cares more about his faith than anyone in the entire world.  His eyes told the story, and allowed us to really follow this ""leader"" blindly into uncharted territory.  I am an enormous fan of Andy Dick, not only does he carry my name, but he also bring to the screen his one style of comedy.  He is notorious for being who he is, and while others may find him annoying, I only see him as comic genius a la Robin Williams.  He is destined to be one of the greats and if he keeps with these films he will surely do well.  The rest of the cast is superb, they really transport you into this world unlike our own.  They really do define themselves and take this film to a new level.  Adam Goldberg and Andy Dick are the staples of this film, while the rest assist in holding the film together.

I would also like to take this time to say that I watched this film with my Jewish friends, and they thought it was hysterical as well.  I have trouble seeing where offense could be taken from this film.  This was a humorous story about the uneducated nature of our culture towards the Hanukkah holiday.  It comes at a time when consumerism is up and family values are at an all time low.  This was no Oscar film, but it did bring to the spotlight a holiday and culture that is normally left on the doorstep.  I applaud Kesselman's hard work and excitement behind this picture.  This could have easily been something that fell through the cracks, but instead it will be something I show to friends time and time again.

Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  The quality of the story, the witty and knowledgeable humor made me laugh as well as use my mind (which is a plus), and the honesty behind the characters was something other films should use more often.  There was just a sense of fun with this picture, and it blasted through my television with the greatest of ease.  This is our new Holiday film in our house.  I am skipping the ""classics"" and creating new ones of my own.  How impressive this film was!

As a simple Buddhist ""Goy-Boy"", I thought this movie was a wonderful twist on the usual movie satires! It should bring all religous persuations to an even playing field and allow all people to just relax for a moment in joining your minds for just some simple laughter!",1101686400,7,466,4.482352941176471

First, I should say that anything that makes fun of stereotypes is for me.  You know the plot so this is for those who aren't sure of they should buy this.  Buy it!  The poor people who made it are already filled with guilt.  Don't make it worse for them.  Give a little.  Send it to a Jewish friend for Chanukah (the correct spelling).  Don't have a Jewish friend?  Shame on you!  Go find one and then send this movie to them.  They'll love it.",1099958400,8,606,4.02542372881356

This film pulls no punches and is equal-opportunity when it comes to poking fun. So if you're ready for some political incorrectness and a lot of laughter, this is the movie to see!",1099526400,11,428,4.487179487179487

2131043,5,B0002WZTQQ,"This is one of the funniest independent films I have ever seen in my life.  Our favorite modern day Jewish hero is not Ariel Sharon or Joseph Lieberman, but none other than the Hebrew Hammer, a Chasidic Jewish bad boy character from Brooklyn.  The Hebrew Hammer, the new Macabee of gen X, is a satirical character, playing up on the Jewish stereotypes of the last 10 Centuries.  When the good ol' Israeli Uzi doesn't do the job, an uber-dose of the dreaded Jewish guilt saves the day.  Just don't pick up that penny...",1098662400,9,518,4.537634408602151
