8241664,1,B0011FL0WU,This movie is a fake. Judging from the title you would think that this is the third movie of the series. You could not be more wrong. This has a completely different storyline and completely different characters. I am not impressed at all. If it is not the same thing than the jerk manufacturer should not give it the same title name.,1369526400,2,334,4.403225806451613
