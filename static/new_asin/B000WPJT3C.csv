8224897,5,B000WPJT3C,"This couple isn't Nick and Nora Charles, but everyone and everything can't be ""the thin man"".  Also, this couple are ""spies""/""detectives: (amateur, and she's sometimes got a bit more on the ball than he, though he's a mystery magazine editor and thinks he's brilliant) an they're fun and somtimes funny.  Remember the times and censorship, and the style of this series quickly sets in and becomes unnoticeable. other than as a cooperating character in the story lines.

I LIKE oldies, and this stuf predates when I got to see a lot of movies that even adventurous young people and adults found entertaining.  My parents took me to British films when I was 3-1/2 to 4 in 1952, and I saw but didn't fully appreciate films from England and Pinetree studfios, comedies mostly, that I've since purchased and collected.  So often I fell asleep in the theater to laughter and hijinks.  My dreams were very happy as a child because of that.  The Norths are sleuths living in Greenwhich Village, NY.

The series is dated but it's fun.  , Barbara Briton andn Riuchard Denning do not ""try too hard"" so the series remained fun.

These things were all a bit ""growm up"" for the age I was when they came out (I was born in 1948).  These are delightful!  I recommend them for the dated bibelots which they are.",1389139200,4,1294,4.62719298245614
8224898,2,B000WPJT3C,The quality is not very good and there is at least one episode which is titled incorrectly.  This particular manufacturer did not do a very good job of cleaning up the old films nor of verifying the correctness of the material.,1377388800,5,227,4.536585365853658
8224899,5,B000WPJT3C,"I don't remeber ever seeing this show on tv back in the 50's or any other time until about 2 months ago I saw a couple of episodes on tv and thought it was a cute series, so I purchased the box set. Mr. and Mrs. North are a cute couple and everywhere they go you can count on somebody committing a crime, but don't worry, they along with the police always come out on top!!!",1374105600,3,374,3.9342105263157894
