8495452,3,B0069RWKXS,"Not a bad film. Like most French films, it has a lot of talking and it would have been better if there was English subtitles. Unless you understand French, I wouldn't recommend this film. It would be nice if a new DVD of this film were to be released with English subtitles in the near future.",1433289600,,293,4.25
8495453,3,B0069RWKXS,"A fascinating, comic, touching account of a family gathering. I found it heart-warming particularly because i have never had a large family. There is much coarseness but i suppose that this may be true to the reality of such gatherings.",1421712000,,236,4.925
8495454,3,B0069RWKXS,"A directing effort by French actress Julie Delpy. Set in the summer of 1979, the slender plot deals basically with her childhood memories, as the ten year old daughter of progressive parents going to Brittany for a family reunion.

One reason I was intrigued to see this movie is that I'm just a year older than Delpy and I remember the worldwide fears about the impending fall of the Skylab space station, from which the movie takes its title (despite the fears, it ended up crashing in an uninhabited part of the Australian desert). Delpy's parents as shown here (she plays her own mother), are, perhaps unintentionally, pretty obnoxious, post 1968 hippies belonging to the self righteous left and always ready to parade their moral superiority. They see themselves as super tolerant and yet they are willing to be totally judgmental toward those who do not share their beliefs. When the film has them argue politics with their conservative relatives (who are of course, portrayed as fat, ugly and vulgar), the couple is naturally given the best lines.

An amusing and risqu scene has Albertine, the young daughter (the alter ego of Delpy) going with her father to a nudist beach, and feeling very uncomfortable there, while her parent is totally blas about the situation. Also with Bernadette Lafont, Emmanuelle Riva and Karin Viard, among others.",1413072000,,1350,4.969026548672566
8495455,4,B0069RWKXS,"Skylab or Le Skylab to give it the original French title is a semi autobiographical film from French film maker Julie Delpy (2 Days in Paris and Before Midnight). She takes us back to the laconic summer of 1979 when she, portrayed as Albertine, enjoys a family reunion in Brittany; this is to celebrate the 67th birthday of her grandmother. The disparate wings of the family gather at a picturesque farmhouse for partying, drinking and making merry, as well as the obligatory family tussles.

The title comes from the events that were unfolding in outer space when the US Skylab space probe was descending to Earth and was allegedly destined to land somewhere in their vicinity. The children have their rivalry as do the parents and themes of imminent destruction are discussed as well as the angst of growing up and the emotions that the onset of the teenage years can bring. This is though billed as a comedy and whilst there are moments of humour albeit mostly the awkward kind, no-one is going to burst a blood vessel actually laughing at this. There is some well observed seventies sexism, some clichd politico stances and lots of people smoking. The period detail is really good with yellow head lights, the legendary Renault 4 and flares.

The plot though does seem to meander and it almost has the feel of a home video in places as the dialogue is so free flowing as to appear almost unscripted  which I am sure was intentional. My favourite part was the kids disco where we have a heady mix of music that included Gilbert OSullivan, one hit wonder Patrick Hernandez and the onset of punk with the Dead Kennedys doing their lovely ditty about the effects of manhood on the libido. So a fair amount to like but not enough to be able to rave about in this film. It is though well above average and I found it quite enjoyable hence my rating.",1391817600,3,1847,4.590909090909091
