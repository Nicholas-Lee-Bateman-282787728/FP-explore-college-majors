The 4 DVDs are a piece of collection. The art on boxes and covers is well designed and the content of the DVDs is superb.
You have both movies on DVD and the resolution is excellent (you do not need a flat screen TV set to start appreciating it) plus you get 2 DVDs with behind the scenes, deleted parts, featurettes, extra information and many many other useful and nice to have data.

1779986,3,B00006JE6T,"First, the movies themselves: Episode I retained the old school mystic feel of the originals, and takes the viewer back to when it all began. It suffers however, from idiotic droids and Jar Jar Binks (who posseses the most annoying voice since C3PO). It's a four star movie at least.
  Episode II tells its story well, but the story is unfortunately unconvincing. Anakin is nothing but an obnoxious teenager for some reason...is the viewer expected to believe that the distinguished order of the Jedi would not educate one of its own disciples on the rudiments of life? Then there's the romance between Senator Amidala and Anakin; even given the circumstances, it's hardly believable due to Anakin's generally creepy nature.  Great special effects though, a decent villian, and we finally get to see Yoda do some fighting which was simply awesome. Even though it's got some great points, it's at best a three star movie. It does require, however, a substantial amount of 'suspension of disbelief' to view and enjoy.
  Now a word about formats: Put simply, if it's not widescreen, it's not worth the money.",1048982400,3,1105,4.951351351351351
1779987,1,B00006JE6T,"All those reviewers who feel compeled to attribute five stars to either of these episodes have their collective heads stuck in a vacuum.  I would give these zero stars, except Amazon won't allow that. After a few viewings, the story line gets thin, the action stale, and the romance, if there is any, is weak.

On top of the poor dramantics, the image we are expected to watch is cropped to full screen; what happens on the sides? how much of the top and bottom is removed by our over scanning TVs.

I refuse to buy full screen versions of any movie filmed in wide screen, period.  Some day, I will have a high definition display and see no reason to waste money for something that will not reap the benifits of that new technology.  In the mean time, my 27 inch system with SVHS input displays the picture window image very nicely and I can always zoom, pan and scan if I feel a need to.

I think George and his cronies are ripping off the public by attempting to foist this mediocre product at an exorbitant price.
Rent it, you will save a large chunk of change, and maybe in eight years or so George will release a widescreen version with all the cuts restored.",1039910400,7,1164,4.341013824884793
1779988,2,B00006JE6T,"I caught bits and piece of Episode I in Full Screen on television last week, and it was chop and cut job, a [relatively] good one, but still lots of things are lost: character's voices heard without them being on screen (or at least half seen) and noises of objects or characters that are no longer seen.
Plus the scope of the cities and the worlds that were created are reduced considerably. The battles and Pod Races, for which these movies get their most of their thrills from are horribly truncated with much of the surrounding action completley deleted.
On the other hand, why are widescreen faithfuls being so extreme? These films ARE INDEED available in Widescreen for those who choose to get the filmaker's prefered format. And you will be better off when full screen buyers end up with Black Bars on the side of their screens in the end when widescreen televisions become dominant, so what's the fuss on our part?

1779991,5,B00006JE6T,"For a Director who claims not to cater to the whims of his franchise's expectation-heavy fanbase, George Lucas certainly appears to be in ""putting wrongs right"" mode with ""Attack of the Clones"".  In truth, ""The Phantom Menace"" could never have lived up to the hype built from 17 years on the back-burner, but few were prepared for what is easily the most disappointing entry into the ""Star Wars"" saga.  For the sequel, to his prequel, Lucas has given the people more of what they wanted (epic galactic upheavals, witty and involving characters) and less of what they didn't like (piddling taxation disputes, Jar Jar Binks), and suddenly all seems back on track again.  So, maybe the geeks will inherit the world after all !
Packaging both prequels together is a pretty canny move to boot.  ""Episode I"" plays far better as an introductory, scene-setting precursor to the grander action of ""Episode II"" than it ever did as a stand-alone mini-epic.  Admittedly, it takes about three hours of watching these back-to-back before much of any real significance happens, but when ""Clones"" kicks in, it does so in mega-Saturday-matinee style.
Okay, so the Anakin-Padme love angle doesn't really gel, but ""Clones"" mostly succeeds in being an interstellar ""Gone With The Wind"" (or ""Titanic"" in space for you of the Y Generation).  It's all there - the doomed romance set against a backdrop of disaster, the extraordinary visual set-pieces, and even a sweeping new John Williams love theme.  ""Clones"" flat-out demands attention, and although far from perfect, the light-year improvement from ""Episode I"" can only mean the concluding chapter (due in 2005) will silence even the staunchest nay-sayers once and for all.",1031184000,7,1704,5.086021505376344

Great CG animation, great story line, and loved by critics, and fans alike!

Unlike what many people think, only the older star wars eps (4 and 5) look a bit outdated (mainly thanks to few CGI, and Chubaka, the ape-like hairy fella in the movie).

EP 1, 2 and 3 have way better animated characters.

You don't have to be a fan, or nerd running around with fake 'light sabers' or 'laser swords' to like the movie!
It really is a great leap in imagination, and wonderful story of the colonial wars in a jacket of the universe (on a larger scale).

A great recommender!

1780018,4,B00006JE6T,"I remember reading all of the horrible reviews of The Phantom Menace and my disappointment upon first seeing the film. Admittedly, it's not the greatest Star Wars film and a lot of the criticisms are valid. However, I recently rewatched it with my wife and started to see some value in it. It is an adventure movie with some pretty cool scenes (the Darth Maul duel in particular). But more importantly, it isn't supposed to focus on character and plot development - that's for Episodes II and III. Rather, TPM is just an adventure story to introduce the world of Star Wars (think the Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings). It isn't a great movie, but it's also not so horrible as to cast it out of the Star Wars saga. Overall, a 3.75 star movie.

In terms of acting, plot, dialogue, and special effects, Attack of the Clones is light years beyond The Phantom Menace. Much of the movie focuses on the mystery of the clone army. It ends with a spectacular battle scene - still one of the best sci-fi battles out there.

I like a lot about Attack of the Clones, but at the end of the day it just seems like the plot still needed to be worked out. There is a whole mystery about who built the clone army, but this is never fully explained. Also, it's not really clear why the Separatists were building a Death Star. I'm a Star Wars geek and it took me a while to figure these plot twists out. It's certainly not going to appeal to casual fans. Also, while the main actors are fine, the extras are sometimes a bit corny - particularly the Jedi at the end of the movie and the other Separatist leaders. Good, but not quite up to par with Episodes IV and V.",1263772800,,1649,4.29903536977492

1780021,1,B00006JE6T,"It puzzles me why Fox only chose to offer a PAN-AND-SCAN box of the first two Star Wars prequels.

If you're a fan of these films, it's much better to buy the separate widescreen releases of each.  You won't get the pretty slipcase, but at least you're getting the whole movie and not a butchered pan-and-scan version.

It is rumored that when Episode III comes out on DVD this November, Fox will release a box set of all three prequels in their proper Widescreen Anamorphic format.  Hopefully that rumor is true.  (Though, since I already own the WS versions of Episodes I and II, I'll forgo the box and pick up the regular release of III.)",1118188800,5,641,4.491379310344827
1780032,1,B00006JE6T,"The Phantom Menace suffers from a horrendous script,but it actually has a couple of scenes that are genuinely entertaining. On the other hand,Attack of the Clones is quite possibly the worst big budget motion picture ever made. The script is even worse than Phantom Menace (and by a long way),and the movie is tedious,almost beyond belief. There is no 'acting',to speak of,rather just lame pronouncements from the various actors. I borrowed a friend's dvd,just to give it a viewing,and I wanted to walk out,even while in my own living room. These movies illustrate,if there was any remaining doubt,that Lucas has lost whatever talent he may have once had. I'm of the opinion that he had very little to begin with.",1106870400,2,713,4.95
1780033,1,B00006JE6T,"There are many words that came to my mind when I first saw these two movies: overblown, pointless, cruel, boring, disappointing, the list goes on and on.

So many things are horribly wrong with this cartoony mess, that it doesn't bear any resemblance to the (brilliant) original trilogy anymore.

In that respect, Episode I isn't nearly as atrocious as Episode II, and that's already saying a lot.

First of all, I don't know how long it took George Lucas to write the scripts for these films, and, actually, it doesn't really matter because IF he put any effort into them, it didn't show on screen, but the dialogues are so wooden that you might as well turn off the sound and read the subtitles only.

Now that we've established that the lines every actor was forced to say are horrendous, it can't look good for the characters either, can it? You can't blame the actors if you consider that they virtually had nothing to work with.

Not a single character in these sorry efforts looks convincing, except for Natalie Portman.

Christiansen's helpless attempts at ""doing some acting"", Jar Jar Binks' infantile jumping around (in one of the many ""all time low"" scenes on Tatooine, he steps into some dog poo), Young-Ani's witty ""Oops"", ""Let's get out of here"" and ""Yeah"" lines ... not a single minute passes without a cringe- worthy moment.

After four hours of pure nonsense and some of the worst ""going through puberty"" moments, a wacky CGI Yoda who bounces off walls doesn't even hurt anymore.

Even some of Christopher Lee's horror flicks are on a higher niveau.

And when I noticed that the chemistry between Portman and the kid who plays young Anakin Skywalker is better than the chemistry between her and Hayden Christiansen, then I finally realised that these films have no saving grace to speak of whatsoever.

And I mean NO saving grace. It's just aching in my stomach when legendary composer John Williams has to step down to this level and underline the worst clich&eacute;s with some stomach- wrenching Hollywood B- movie love and action music.

Now the effects. Hailed by so many people out there who call them fantastic or a work of art.

Now, this may be my personal point of view, but CGI is there to enhance the movie, to put something on screen that you couldn't have done in any other way.

The gigantomany Lucas put on screen is no art.

The art is to make it look real, touchable.

That's what made the original trilogy, or Lord Of The Rings, tick: that the viewer can indulge into this world.

And CGI is not the only tool; miniatures can look great, good make-up and costumes, animatronics, and so on.

CGI is not the solution of everything.

You need some skills to make this world look real, which Lucas seemingly doesn't have.

Everything is so smooth and flawless that it just looks artificial.

Look at the Clone army and compare it to the Uruk- Hai army in The Two Towers.

See now why Lord of the Rings got the Oscar and not Episode II?

And the depressing thing is that after seeing the trailer for Episode III, it seems like we're getting another flick of the same pattern.

With Hayden Christiansen! Hooray!

Get out the earmuffs, here it comes!

I could give it an additional star because there's unintentional amusement value in these flicks.",1104969600,6,3278,4.668989547038327
1780034,1,B00006JE6T,"I remember watching these two films at the theater.  After the movies finished, I had a sudden desire to go take a shower.

1780035,2,B00006JE6T,"Phantom Penice and Attack of the Boners lack the spirit and greatness that the original Star Wars had. George Lucas has gone completly overboard with the special FX. I think they say that 96% of the movie's have a SFX shot in them somewhere. And watching the behind the scenes as actors are doing nothing but jumping around infront of green screens is a complete and utter bore.
The original Star Wars movies had somthing special about them, but it wasn't just the SFX. I think George has lost it by thinking the FX will carry these movies. In the original it had a new excitment about what was happening? and what was a Jedi? and it was filled with action and adventure... then Umpire Strikes back continued that, with alot of newer great action seaqunces, but also adding that Vader is Lukes father, and in Return of the Jedi, Luke and Leia are brother and sister... and many more things added to the charactors and plot of the films.... which is where these 2 new ones fail. Going monsterous over board with computers and FX and not concintrating hard enough on plot ideas, and originality has brought these 2 to screw up the Star Wars saga. The FX can be ok in some parts of the films, but there is just too much of it, enough to make me sick. Film makers these days should be concintrating on making the best film they can, not worrying about how to do somthing on a computer, putting it on screen, and then at the end of the day just before knock off time, think about a plot to go around the FX for a minute, and go with whatever is off the top of your head?
George needs to rethink his statagy and worry about the FX of these things after making a great movie, not just slapping a few actors together and then seeing what great things the computer can do these days. It seems that Lucas knew he had a billion devoted fans who think apon him as a god, and knew that if he put 2 stick figures on the screen, blasted the intro, and showed an Ewok shave his underarms for over 2 hours, he'd make million sof it. What is sorely missed in these movies is the beleivable models used in the originals. This whole CGI thing has gone WAY overboard, and made things look too unrealistic.... to the person who said they wouldnt be suprised to see Shrek and Donkey waving in the background... good call... I agree with you 100%!
The CGI is too much in these films and rueins them",1085184000,5,2374,4.313199105145414

  Now...call me a purist....call me old fashioned etc....Im still trying to get used to all the computer special effects in Star Wars.  Im used to puppets....now we get computerized monsters.  Ill have to grow to like them hehe.

1780038,2,B00006JE6T,"The Phantom Menace-Hated by Star Wars purists everywhere, TPM fails because it's not consistently entertaining.  That's most unfortunate because the movie gets off to a hell of a rousing start, with our two heroic Jedis, Qui-Gonn Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, fending off robotic assailants.  And the movie actually gets better, with some visually amazing sights, particularly the underwater cities of Naboo.  The point the movie collapses is when the characters land on Tatooine and are introduced to Anakin Skywalker, played atrociously by Jake Lloyd.  From the point on, the story just dwindles its potential, dragging endlessly without any relief in sight.  Well, relief finally comes, almost 70 minutes later!  The movie picks up significantly in the climax, with a two-on-one lightsaber battle that's simply magnificent.  Call it a case of too little too late for me, but at least the film ends on a high note.  TPM boasts a cast of fine actors: Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, and Samuel L. Jackson.  But aside from Neeson, everyone is wooden, an oddity considering that the original Star Wars boasted almost no proven talents (at the time) but were still superior to the cast on hand here.
** 1/2/*****
Attack of the Clones-This sequel to Phantom Menace is, in the end, not really better or worse than its predecessor.  The dialogue is just as awful as before and there's an insipid love story that's not the slightest bit romantic or believable.  The cast is about on the same level as before, with Ewan Mcgregor impressing me a bit more with his almost dead-on Alec Guinness impression.  Unfortunately, the political backdrop is boring and a little confusing, and most of the action sequences are surprisingly dull, the only true exception being the knockout colosseum battle sequence.  The climactic lightsaber duel is a huge step backward from Episode I, there's no Ray Park/Darth Maul here to display versatile athleticism.  The fact that Anakin Skywalker is a whiny teen doesn't bother me, that's the way he should be, but the fact that it's all noticeably acting on the part of Hayden Christensen is completely damning.  Anyone under the age of fifteen will greatly enjoy the picture.  Everyone else, well, that's a little tougher to tell.",1066521600,3,2262,5.056603773584905
