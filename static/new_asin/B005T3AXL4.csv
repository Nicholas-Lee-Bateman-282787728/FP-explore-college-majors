8485726,5,B005T3AXL4,"""Beyond Man And Time"" is an amazing studio recording by RPWL in its own right, so imagine my surprise (and joy!!!) when I discovered that this DVD was being released to somewhat accompany that album!  This is a wonderful performance by a band that I truly admire and love listening to ... plain and simple.  Highly highly highly recommended!",1419897600,,341,4.762711864406779
8485727,3,B005T3AXL4,Great music as expected. The video quality however is not so good. The group should get a better DVD in the future.,1403308800,,115,4.2727272727272725
8485728,5,B005T3AXL4,"This DVD captures RPWL in true live fashion. All the songs performed are from their album, ""Beyond Man and Time"", as the title suggests. The encore is ""ROSES"". Done in true fashion, along with a special guest appearance by Ray Wilson doing the vocals with Yogi.  The talent in this band is amazing. I have seen them perform ""live"", and this ""live"" performance is an excellent show. Yogi is always a true performer. Here he dresses in assorted different costumes to depict the story being told in the songs.(Ala ,Peter Gabriel). All the songs in this concert are outstanding.  I also have their other live DVD (The RPWL ""Live"" Experience), another great DVD.
If you know this band, you may already own this DVD if not you should get it ASAP.
For those of you who are not familiar with RPWL. Take a very talent group of musicians with creative talents and cross it with the music of Pink Floyd, and you have an amazing combination. Purchase this DVD and you will be turning all your friends onto this band. I can not get enough of RPWL.",1398816000,,1034,4.524064171122995
8485729,5,B005T3AXL4,"This is not my first experience with RPWL but I had never heard the new release on CD so my first experience of it was from this incredible video.
Why couldn't Rush have made a video like this for Clockwork Angels instead of the eye-jarring mess they made?

This was so well produced in every aspect. The surround mix is very well done.
And the music is their best yet. They just keep getting better and better.
Looking forward to hearing and seeing Wanted.
Sure wish they'd tour the US.

If you like the mellower music of Riverside (from Poland), Steve Hackett, older Genesis/Peter Gabriel, the mellower music of Porcupine Tree, or any other similar music, you'll like this. There are even shades of late 70s Manfred Mann.",1393718400,2,723,4.640625
8485730,5,B005T3AXL4,"When I was in my twenties I was raised on the concept album. The Lamb Lies Down being my favorite of all time. Several years ago we saw The Musical Box perform it in it's entirety and was happy for my wife to finally see it.
And most recently we purchased Marillion's live performance of Brave in it's entirety.
I must say, concept albums are great for the music but in my opinion to do a whole show is quite draining on the viewer. With Brave and now this concert I feel drained by the end of the show.
A regular concert performing a catalog of archived material from many albums is much more fun, and enjoyable, at least to me.
That is why following viewing this concert my wife and I looked at each other and said we liked the RPWL Experience DVD better.

That being said, this is an important and very well performed concert for RPWL and I still highly recommend it. Like a Porcupine Tree concert it has valleys and peaks. The musicianship and vocal performance by Yogi is excellent. If you're a fan of the Moog Voyager you won't be disappointed. It's used quite a bit and it's analog sound adds a lot of character to the music.(I have one and love it).

Visually there are places I find annoying, and after several viewings I still find a few things distracting AND annoying.
The shadow of the dancer is distracting and I found myself wishing he would go away, but the dance just went on and on.
Also I found many of the costume changes to be unnecessary. It is the music that makes RPWL special, so I personally didn't need all this other stuff.
As it was we eventually turned of the visual and just listened to the music, and without the distractions it was more enjoyable.
We turned it back on for the closing song Roses performed with Ray Wilson.
What a great voice, makes you wonder what could've been had Genesis done another album with him.

It seems like the mix is off a bit for the first half of the show, and then after that it sweetens up really nicely.

UPDATE 3/14/14: After further viewings, this concert is rapidly becoming one of our favorites.
Not having had the album first, the costumes seemed overdone. But after watching it numerous times, they now make sense and are enjoyable.
I still find the shadow dance a bit too busy in the beginning, but am now able to tune it out and enjoy the overall performance.

Musically and visually this concert is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it.
The music is exceptional and you'll find after repeated listens, bits of songs magically appearing in your head throughout the day.

5 stars Highly recommended.",1389052800,,2576,4.470212765957447
8485731,5,B005T3AXL4,"I am a HUGE fan of RPWL.  It is so wonderful to know there is a current, relatively new band that is keeping the wonder of progressive music alive and well.",1384473600,,156,4.032258064516129
8485732,4,B005T3AXL4,"The video portion of the SHOW is really good, considering it's NOT Blu-ray.  The screens behind the band were also very good and entertaining.  The music sounded oh so close to the CD BEYOND MAN AND TIME.  After performing the entire album, they then brought out SPECIAL guest Ray Wilson (OUTSTANDING voice) and performed ROSES for their ""Swan Song"" (close to a 90 minute show)!  The only negative thing I MUST add is that it is NOT Dolby Digital 5.1; it's 5.0!!!!  All of the bass came through the Front Left & Right and Center speakers.  Yogi, I'm sorry but I NEVER got a signal to my sub-woofer at anytime during the SHOW!  AND I listen to 5.1 music every day!!!!!!!!!!!!  I then loaded LIVE experience into my OPPO and the .1 was great on that concert!  I guess I've been spoiled by SW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF there would have been a .1, I would have rated this DVD 5 stars PLUS!",1381449600,7,878,4.43125
