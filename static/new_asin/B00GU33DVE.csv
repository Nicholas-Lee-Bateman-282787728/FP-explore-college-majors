8627569,5,B00GU33DVE,"I have been using Sabrina Mesko's DVDs for years and they are terrific.  This DVD is beautiful and well organized.  There are many mudras to choose from to design your own practice.  This is the second half of the mudras, covering chakras 4, 5, 6 and 7.  I cannot say enough good about Dr. Mesko and her teachings.",1476057600,,314,4.362068965517241
8627570,4,B00GU33DVE,"This DVD has high quality production values, good video quality and good background music.  The mudras shown are generous in number, and they have quite specific intentions.  To increase their effect, they are paired with mantras, or specific sounds.  Everything appears fully exotic to the western eye.  Ms. Mesko could be from the far east or, perhaps, from New Jersey, but it all appears fully exotic.  While the DVD shows how to form the mudras, it omits telling us how long the mudra needs to be held to have effect.  This timing information would be both for the mudra holding at one session and for the number of sessions required to get an effect.  The idea that three minutes will get it done may be slightly misleading.  So, there will be western people who try for too short a time (either way), and just conclude that this doesn't work.  I was trying this out under the notion that it might be a helpful exercise, something like a push up or a pull up.  That seems to be naive.  Even in short trying, it became clear that this is a spiritual practice associated with an eastern religion.  For people of a religious bent, it is probably not desirable to mix religious traditions.  This derives from a Hindu context.",1470528000,,1226,4.594470046082949
