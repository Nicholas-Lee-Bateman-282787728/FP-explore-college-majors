6355885,5,B00JENCAFC,"""Space Trucker Bruce"" is a sci fi comedy about a hog fat trucker.  It's low budget, but that just seems to make it all that more entertaining.  If you like ""Red Dwarf"" or the older ""Dr. Who"" episodes, you will probably like ""Bruce.""  The animation and plot are excellent, and there are plenty of funny moments.  Another plus is, it's family friendly.  No nudity or sex.  A great homespun movie to kick back and relax with after a difficult day!",1402704000,2,444,4.4875
6355886,4,B00JENCAFC,"Laughably low budget, but the film embraces this.  It wasn't a great piece of filmaking, but it was way better than I expected and very very funny in places.  I will never look at sour cream in the same way again.  Also, Nessie rocks!",1400544000,2,234,4.2727272727272725

For such a low budget this guy made great sets, some of which I still can't figure out how he made them. The people in the film did a good acting job as well! I especially liked the guy that played the titular space trucker, he was great. This film had a style and pacing that reminds us a little bit of John Carpenter's DARK STAR, which is cool! This low budget gem I found to be light years funnier than the foul mouthed trash Hollywood mega budget comedies of Seth Rogen and Kevin Smith. Watch this film with an open mind, you won't be disappointed. You're in for one hilarious ride.

8650290,3,B00JENCAFC,"Okay I fell asleep watching this but I was tired and started to watch it when I needed to sleep.  So this is not a review of the full movie.  This movie is like a sequel to the movie Space Truckers which is available elsewhere and can be bought online from Amazon Prime for a lot less than the Blue Ray copy of Space Truckers.  I'm a prime member so I watched this movie for free.  There is a nice bit of low budget brilliance in the approach of this film maker.  Some may criticize this as low budget and bad acting.  Well this certainly isn't high budget, but for a low budget movie this shows you what can be done with a low budget and actually it's quite good.  Now it's a kind of off beat remake of Space Truckers in some way. It's mixing themes of space and trucking which to some will make this seem to be unique and genius, but I'm sure the person who made this had to watch Space Truckers and decide to do a lower budget remake of it.  If you're shooting with very limited funds kind of like the Rodreguez style of film making, this is what you might hope to be able to create.  This of course is no ""shoot the guitar player"" but it's certainly entertaining for those who can appreciate the humor of a truck driver in space.

With a larger budget this might be a better stinker which people can laugh at but it still offers some laughs.  I'm defiinately going to queue it up and watch it.  I actually wanted to get Space Truckers and watch that first and decided to buy the Space Trucker movie and watch that before waking up enough to watch this full movie.  The reason I wanted to watch the other movie was I wanted to find out how much this one borrowed from the ealier movie.  I'm hoping this is more like a sequel to Space Truckers or a different view and not a low budget rip off remake.  I will have to watch the entire movie to know if it is a sequel or a remake.",1531440000,,1880,4.098360655737705

The cast and crew obviously had a good time making it but it falls short of most peoples entertainment expectations.  The actors are likeable enough even though the performances are very Jr high but that goes with this genre so met with my own expectations.  The script would have done well with the Bruce Campbell stamp on it and I am a little surprised they weren't able to sell it to his group.
