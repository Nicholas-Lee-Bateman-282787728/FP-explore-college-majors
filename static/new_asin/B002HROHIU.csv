8370504,5,B002HROHIU,"These releases by Kino DVD is eye opening perfect for the lover of retro, vintage and old-school reality. I laughed and roared with humor seeing these old films. Priceless product. Worth ever red cent. Hilarious and most of all a great trip into the past.",1433116800,,255,4.688888888888889
8370505,4,B002HROHIU,funny but it does say something,1409961600,,31,4.333333333333333
8370506,4,B002HROHIU,This is just too funny to watch.  I forgot how repressed we all were.,1285113600,,69,3.9285714285714284
8370507,5,B002HROHIU,"Yes , there are a lot of funny things from previous decades in these educational films . I would think this would be an excellent disc to play at a large gathering or party . It's a very stimulating conversation prompter . As a huge fan of fiction films from previous decades i feel this is an absolutely fascinating glimpse at clothing , hairstyles , posture , conduct , screen writing and so on from these times past . I don't know if it'll be you're thing but you certainly owe yourself at least a rental if curious . Strongly recommended .",1272758400,8,543,4.333333333333333
8370508,4,B002HROHIU,"This collection of old educational films can be funny and bothersome at the same time. In some cases I found I was learning WAY more than I really needed to. Still, a good product and well worth watching.",1268956800,5,204,4.394736842105263
8370509,5,B002HROHIU,I have not heard it but I gave it to friends for Christmas and they think it is very very funny. I first saw it recommended on a TV morning show.,1265500800,2,145,3.7096774193548385
8370510,4,B002HROHIU,"These ""health"" films from my childhood were a blast from the past, to say the least. It is amazing how much women have progressed in their lifestyles and roll in the family. This was totally enjoyed as well by my daughter, who is 28. It was a real cultural eyeopener for her. I recommend the companion films on ""How to be a Man"", especially to compare the differences between how boys and girls were raised. Good for a laugh and a peek at how things were. I highly recommend these to anyone with a penchant for nostalgia!",1264809600,5,521,4.381443298969073
8370511,3,B002HROHIU,"When I first saw this collection, I thought the shorts were all from 1948, and was surprised when they started discussing waiting for sex, and more adult themes from the 60s-80s.

""Wonders of Reproduction"" is basically a guy talking about how his fish reproduce (which has nothing to do with humans, and is kind of a let-down from the title). ""Why Study Economics?"" ""Lets Make a Sandwich"" ""Growing Girls"" (which actually does get into human reproduction, and the way women in the 40s/50s dealt with menstruation is pretty interesting)and ""Pattern for Smartness"" are probably the best on the disc. Notice how the Home Economics Teacher keeps showing up with her wise and womanly advice (an old maid at 26!).

The more contemporary ones are just flashy and weird. ""Redbook 18-34"" gave me a headache, and ""Girls are Better Than Ever"" was just stupid. ""Attack"" is worth a watch, just to see the Brown Belt 5'5"" 100lb instructor with her heels and cat-eye glasses pummel the attacking man. It's especially satisfying when she finally gives him a kick to the groin.

Overall, I'd say it's worth watching, but not owning.",1255478400,17,1114,4.883597883597884
