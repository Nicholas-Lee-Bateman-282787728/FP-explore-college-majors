8114244,4,B000EU1LEK,"if one sees a cover picture with Kevin in early eighties dungarees style on a DVD called ""It was like this"", one might expect a DVD of a concert from the early eighties. Nowhere in the description is it made clear that this DVD is from a concert from 1993 with Kevin in yet another guise, a pinstripe-suited balding middle-aged soul crooner, with a band that doesn't exactly consist of young soul rebels either.

The music isn't bad at all, but is more in the vein of ""Don't stand me down"" than ""Geno"". I quite like it, although the excitement of the earlier incarnations of the Dexy's seems te be lacking a bit.",1172102400,6,612,4.415929203539823
