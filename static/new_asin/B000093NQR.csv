7989030,5,B000093NQR,"This DVD is above and beyond 5 stars, I would say no less than 10 stars. There's also a very good reason why I bought two instead of one...",1171843200,3,139,3.8275862068965516
7989031,5,B000093NQR,"The music is fantastic, the perfomers are first rate and the technical aspects of the video production are excellent.  Buy this DVD, pop it into a large screen TV hooked up to a big sound system and crank it up.

Henry Butler on the piano makes magic.  Amadee Castanell on sax is a virtuoso.  Deacon is a charismatic performer who makes you smile while you soak up the music.  Mac is great and Wardell's charts and conducting is tight and rockin'.

You will love this DVD.  I promise.",1126569600,7,484,4.431818181818182
7989032,5,B000093NQR,"I've always been a big fan of fifties swing era and big band jazz, but didn't really know much about the New Orleans scene of that day.  I'd also never heard of Deacon John Moore until I turned on the television late one evening and was mesmerized by this powerful music.

I immediately wrote down the name of this wonderful performer and the title of his concert film (Deacon John's Jump Blues) so I could research him on the web the very next morning.  When I discoverd that I could get this concert on DVD I was thrilled.

Deacon's voice is hauntingly strong and he hit notes that sent chills down my spine.  The music is truly infectious and will make you want to jump up and shake a leg. All the musicians involved, young and old alike had such a great time, it's hard not to feel the joy for your very own.

The high calibre musicianship and massively entertaining stage show were more than I could fathom. I felt like somebody had thrown me into Mr. Peabody's time machine and I wished I could stay and bask in this era forever.

If you are tired of the soulless trite music that today's corporations cram into your ears, consider re-visiting the music that was there when blues was king and rock and roll was just learning to walk.  Deacon John Moore is truly a magical entertainer, you will not be dissapointed.",1109376000,6,1320,4.425619834710743
7989033,5,B000093NQR,"This was a tremendous CD marking the debut of a New Orleans legend, Deacon John.  I love all the songs and the film gave a tremendous view of all the fun that took place that night on and off stage.  Great job...I thoroughly enjoyed it. You Go Deacon!!! It's about time someone showcased your talent.. you deserved it.",1056844800,10,318,4.4655172413793105
