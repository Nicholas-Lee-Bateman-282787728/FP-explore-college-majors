7943873,4,B00005LC64,"In one word, this movie is about the effect, especially the psychosexual effects, of pederasty.  In this case, it is incestuous pederasty.  [Check one of the on-line dictionaries if you are unfamiliar with this word.]  When the father tried to cover up his past, all sorts of things backfire on him and, even worse, for his son.

This is a very psychological movie, if you understand it.  It must have been written by a victim, now grown, to have such a strong impact.",1155427200,,468,4.590361445783133
7943874,5,B00005LC64,"I first rented this movie years ago and was impressed.  This film pulls back the stops, it has the great music score, excellent acting, a deep, gritty story, and a slam dunk ending.  I love film and I may be going out on a limb, but of the 300 + DVDs I own, this is probably my favorite.  The entire film keeps you interested, but that ending, some would say predictable, but I was not expecting this.  I was expecting a typical hollywood ending that would take a little away from the raw story, but that did not happen.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I would be hard pressed to find a better ending of any movie.  This film should be seen by a large audience.  You will not find a hollywood film today that has the b*lls to make an ending like this.  Take for example John Q a pretty good film, but the ending was highly dissapointing.  The film John Q was trying to make a point:  health care is too damn expensive and should be affordable to everyone.  But in the end they chickened out.  If you really want to make that point, John Q would have really blown his brains out and his son would have died, because that in reality is probably what would have happened.  But that would be too much of a downer for the masses, they don't want reality, they want happy feel good endings, and sometimes so do I.  But if you want to see a movie that does not have a happy ending, but a just ending, watch Sweet Thing.",1148774400,2,1410,4.189591078066915
7943875,3,B00005LC64,"A low-budget film with relatively high production values, ""Sweet Thing"" is a fine first feature, loaded with flaws.  The story follows a young artist whose bizarre, controversial artwork raises questions of the boy's sexuality--further upsetting his father's failing political career.  The music and imagery of the film are supurb and effictively chilling and creepy, even if the film's twists are predictable and unsatisfying.  On a short, throw-away featurette, the director describes the film as a movie he'd want to see, which is understanable.  It's a film I'd want to see--melodramatic, creepy, raw, without a real happy ending.  And while most of the elements of the film kept me interested throughout, the flaws were unmistakable.  I look forward to seeing future releases of this filmmaker.",1009238400,6,799,5.403225806451613
