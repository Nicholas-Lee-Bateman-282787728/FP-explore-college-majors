7898940,4,6305930937,Great episodes and fun stories! Don't miss this title if you are a collector or a fan. Very sweet message wrapped up in classic Teletubbie cuteness.,1357516800,,148,4.730769230769231
7898941,5,6305930937,I ordered these for a birthday of an Autistic child.  He is even comforted just carrying the cover around and loves to watch them as well.,1356393600,,138,4.3076923076923075
7898942,3,6305930937,"This is one of our favorite Teletubbies videos! You won't be able to get ""Wake Up Wake Up"" out of your head. It's an adorable segment where children wake up their drowsy caregiver. Another memorable number has a live swing band singing ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" out in the field while children dance around. Your little ones will love it!",1206835200,,332,4.6440677966101696
7898943,4,6305930937,He has watched some or all of this at least once a day for several months.  It actually has a couple of funny scenes for adults (like when they are crunching their tubby toast too loud while Dipsy is sleeping).,1078876800,3,210,4.25
7898944,4,6305930937,"The Teletubbies are gentle and caring. I realize there was some controversy over the Teletubbies. However, I found them to teach sweet lessons of caring, watching over each other, gentleness and so on.
This video is about going to bed and having sweet dreams. There are lullaby songs, short little segments that are typical of the other Teletubbies vidoes make this a good video to watch for five to ten minutes before turning off the TV. Manners for when someone is sleeping are demonstrated in one segment. Nothing is repeated which makes this a much more engaging video than the other Teletubbies videos.
Enjoy.",1029628800,13,614,4.913461538461538
7898945,5,6305930937,"Bright colors, slow pace, nice transitions, fun jazz band. Encourages napping,  going to bed, and teaches manners when somebody else is sleeping. Shows a preschooler how to help care for a sibling. Great diversity. Good parent guide. Familiar music is a big hit. The kids loved singing along, doing the actions and dancing. They shouted when they saw their favorite characters. ""It was fun to look at."" ""Teletubbies treat each other right."" Repeating the live characters was a plus. Best for ages 0 to 2.",1000425600,9,504,4.929411764705883
7898946,1,6305930937,I am not sure why they say this is not published yet because I purchased this for my 2 yr.old son for Christmas 2000.  I do not recommend this video at all.  It only makes my son wilder at bedtime.  There is no routine for bedtime and it is always daylight during the video and the other teletubbies just laugh.  I laughed at myself for buying it.,979430400,7,347,4.134328358208955
7898947,5,6305930937,"If you have seen Teletubbies before, its the same edge of the seat heart thumping excitement (not!).  But from my 10 month old daughter's  perspective, this is great stuff.
The Teletubbies speak a little more  than usual, and the seventy minutes of video has no repeats (prefaced by  the famous ""Again!  Again!"").
A delightful adventure for anyone  learning to watch television.",965174400,22,378,5.114754098360656
