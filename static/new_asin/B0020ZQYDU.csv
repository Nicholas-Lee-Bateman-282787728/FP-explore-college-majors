8348727,5,B0020ZQYDU,"For those interested in the Continuation War in particular or in WW2 history in general, this film depicts the events leading up to the cessation of hostilities after the Battle of Tali-Ihantala. Movie comes with a variety of language options (audio in German or Finnish) with a selection of sub-titles (English, Dutch, etc.).",1504915200,,326,5.169811320754717
8348728,5,B0020ZQYDU,Great movie as far as the combat scenes. The uniforms and equipment are excellent. Great movie of the gallant Finns doing all they can to stop the Soviet Red Army from steamrolling through Finland.,1483142400,,197,4.823529411764706
8348729,3,B0020ZQYDU,"How can you not root for the Finns in WWII.

Entertaining movie, though each time I got interested in a character they seemed to get killed.  Fortunately they took a larger number of Russians with them.

Ambush and the Winter War were much better, but it kept my interest.",1482796800,3,272,4.510204081632653

8348733,2,B0020ZQYDU,"I already had the DVD version of this movie and liked it a lot. I bought the Blu-ray thinking it would look much better in HD. WRONG!
They must have done a direct DVD-to-Blu-ray transfer of the movie. It looks EXACTLY like the DVD version. No improvement in color, sharpness, or audio. Save your money and get the DVD version. There is no benefit to the Blu-ray version",1405814400,20,369,4.4411764705882355
8348734,2,B0020ZQYDU,"The director attempts to recreate a documentary like effect. In the process, the underlying plot becomes disjointed and the movie becomes a collection of unrelated vignettes. Unless you are tank buff (great shots, including some interior ones of properly painted and marked T-34/76, T-34/85, KV-1, Sturmgeschutz III, SU-152 and T-26) you will be disappointed. At times it is even boring (even though I am a war movie fan and will put up with almost anything!). The only thing going for this movie is the painstaking attention to historical accuracy in uniforms and military equipment. It is a shame for what it could have been.",1257552000,11,627,5.038461538461538
