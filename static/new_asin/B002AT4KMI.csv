8360325,5,B002AT4KMI,"This is a masterfully done DVD.  Artistically, it stands above so many DVDs and CDs on the market.
I rate it as tops, with no quibbling in my mind.",1418860800,,147,4.068965517241379
8360326,5,B002AT4KMI,"I bought this because of Tabackin, and he does NOT disappoint!  BIG tenor sound, and he's equally monstrous on the flute!  Fun DVD!",1362614400,,131,4.6521739130434785
8360327,5,B002AT4KMI,"I came across this DVD of the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra by sheer chance. As the happy owner of most of this brilliant band's albums recorded between 1974 and 2001 (either the West Coast version with West Coast musicians up to 1984 or the later East Coast version) I wondered whether anything of its work was available on film. The present concert program provides us with a ringside seat at a Chicago nightclub and to judge from the personnel (given at the end of the concert), it is the East Coast version from around 1987. Apart from Toshiko's husband, Lew Tabackin, a highly underrated tenor player in the Sonny Rollins mould, and a brilliant flute player as well, we also get to see and hear solos from Brian Lynch (trumpet), Hart Smith (trombone), Frank Wess (alto) and Jim Snidero (tenor). Of course, Toshiko's Bud Powell style piano is frequently featured and her astute conducting of the band is a highlight in itself. The rhythm section of Dennis Irwin and Jeff Hirshfield ensure the band swings at all times. There are also brief snippets of Toshiko offering her reflections on big band arranging and composing, and her similarity to Duke Ellington is striking, with her interesting and original arrangements tailored to individual players.
My only complaint is that whereas the DVD claims to have 60 minutes of music, in fact the real time is closer to 48 minutes, and this includes a repeat of ""Strive for Jive"". But for the lover of modern big bands, and Toshiko's in particular, this all-too-brief concert is manna from heaven. The sound and vision are of an acceptable standard, even if the lighting of the bandstand is uneven, with some players in virtual darkness at times.
Jazz has always been male-dominated, with a few distinguished exceptions. Hence, for a Japanese woman, born in China, to have created such a remarkable jazz orchestra which almost exclusively plays her own compositions and arrangements is to border on the miraculous. Grab this DVD while it is still available.",1293926400,8,2007,4.905882352941177
