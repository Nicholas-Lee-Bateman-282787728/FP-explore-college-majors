8229961,5,B000XVA9DY,"I have over 500 martial arts movies in my collection and this is quite possibly my favorite martial arts movie of all time.  It is certainly in my Top 10!  Conan Lee is outstanding and I only wish he'd made more movies.  Hiroyuki Sanada is another very talented martial artist and in my opinion this is perhaps his best performance as he matches up with Conan Lee.  The fights are superb and the acrobatics are amazing!  Even the acting is decent.  The Director, Corey Yuen, has some fine movies to his credit (Above the Law, Hero, Secret Rivals 2).  But this one's his masterpiece.  If you are a fan of this genre, don't miss this one!  You will not be disappointed!  Doesn't get any better than this!!!",1435881600,,704,4.47244094488189

8229963,5,B000XVA9DY,I am very much into Chinese theatre and watching the old Kung Fu films. This film was a riot to watch. Even the scenes that were meant to be serious brought a chuckle. The fight scenes were well done and the actors are skillful to pull them. A real fun film to watch.,1356393600,,267,4.056603773584905
8229964,5,B000XVA9DY,"I watched this movie when I was 6 years old, back in 1982.  Back then, I must have watched this movie for 100 times no exaggeration.  I've recently watch the movie again, after like after 27 years.  Hand down this is the best Ninja movie ever made!!!!!",1340668800,,252,4.319148936170213
8229965,5,B000XVA9DY,"If you enjoy quality action, authentic weaponry of the shinobi, and kick butt fighting scenes, then pick up this movie.  The story if solid, and the script has some quality humor written in.  Definitely a must title to add to your quality ninja movie library.  Kamui Gaiden should be the next movie you buy.  Enjoy one of the best ninja movies made.",1330646400,2,349,4.580645161290323
8229966,5,B000XVA9DY,"Ninja in the Dragon's Den is an awesome kung fu/ ninja film. Hiroyuki Sanada plays the Ninja, who is killing government officials and who has MAD ninja skills, while Conan Lee plays the student of a ninja. Both are at each other's throats, constantly one-upping one another, and they finally settle their differences just in time to face the spiritual boxer played by Hwang Jang Lee, who seeks out Conan Lee because Conan belittles the spiritual boxer's student early in the film.

I own the Red Sun dvd version of Ninja is the Dragon's Den (aka Long zhi ten she), 1982, directed by Corey Yuen, produced by Ng See Yuen (Snake in the Eagle's Shadow). The film is 96 minutes long, with English dubbing, and the box says 2.35: 1, which is a nice widescreen version on my HDTV. No subtitles available. DVD gets 3.5 stars for quality, since its WS and a reasonably good picture.

Overall, one of the best kung fu/ martial arts films out there. The dvd quality leaves a little something to be desired, but the story is great, the fighting is amazing, and it was extremely entertaining, especially any part involving ninja Hiroyuki Sanada. Top 20 favorite kung fu flick of mine.

4.5 out of 5 stars.",1323820800,,1192,4.613207547169812
8229967,5,B000XVA9DY,"A classic from day past. We see the debut of Conan Lee paired up with Hiroyuki Sanada.  Lots of action, fighting sequences and funny moments. Recommended for those who like martial arts.",1298332800,,186,4.8125
8229968,5,B000XVA9DY,"This movie was one I saw 20+years ago.

8229969,5,B000XVA9DY,"I'LL  KEEP IT SHORT & SWEET.
I HAVE OVER 50 KUNG-FU DVD'S IN MY COLLECTION & HAVE WATCHED MANY MORE TITLES.

IN MY OPINION, THIS IS SOME OF THE MOST KICK A** NINJA (JAPAN)~vs~ KUNG FU (CHINA) ACTION YOU WILL SEE..

~THERE ARE ONLY TWO OTHERS THAT ARE IN THE SAME LEAUGE THEY ARE:
Chinese Super Ninja & Fist of Legend (JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTS W/ NO NINJAS).

~THE NEXT BEST TITLES ARE: NINJA IN THE DEADLY TRAP, SHAOLIN CHALLENGES NINJA.

YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THE TITLES LISTED, BUT GET THE TITLES @ THE TOP FIRTS THER ARE SUPERIOR.

ENJOY,, MASTER LEE CHI",1222560000,7,563,4.314285714285714
