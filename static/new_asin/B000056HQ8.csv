1397464,2,B000056HQ8,"This movie had WONDERFUL acting; you would be hard pressed to find better acting from EVERY actor in a family movie.  The problem lies in the story...  While the idea was cute and perfect for a family film, it was just too pathetic for anyone, including kids, to relate to.  Even if a kid was to take over the world, grown adults wouldn't think of serving his every whim.  This movie should definatly be seen once by every family with young kids, but once is enough, trust me...  Parts are very funny, and others very touching but the story is the scum of movie making.",1076198400,3,569,4.380952380952381

1397466,3,B000056HQ8,"You have to see this movie to see macho man Bruce Willis in a bunny suit.  Beyond Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood plays North, a young boy whose parents live the yuppie stereotype.  It seems they never have time for him, though he's every parent's ""perfect child"".  Because North is so unhappy, he decides to find new parents.  There is a small plot twist here that I leave the viewer to find for themselves.  During North's travels he meets all sorts of strange people, including one relatively normal family.
Perhaps the strangest and funniest of North's potential parents are Dan Ackroyd and Reba McEntire as over-the-top Texans.  Everything on their ranch is big, and everything they do has a sense of exaggeration about it.  It's campy and funny and corny.  North also gets to go to Hawaii and Alaska among a couple of other places.  There was one place where I felt a bit uncomfortable during his stopover in Alaska, though, as Grandpa (Abe Vigoda) was getting set to sail off into the sunset.  While there may be some truth in the custom, I felt the portrayal was a bit disturbing.
Some reviewers have faulted this movie as being terrible or awful.  While this movie was unlikely to win any awards, Elijah's performance was good.  Further, I felt that this movie was suitable for children.  The reaction I've seen from children thus far has been positive.
Many adults will likely not appreciate this movie as there are too many clich&eacute;s.  Furthermore, some aspects of the movie have been previously done.  Lastly, the corny way in which some vignettes are done can be distracting.  However, you need to remember the source of the vignettes, and realize that the camp and corn are appropriate to the source.  Enough said.
I thought the movie was interesting and watchable.  Admittedly portions are weak, but I found a number of funny points.  The first time I watched I wasn't paying as close attention, and lost how North transitioned from being in the mall to looking for new parents, and thus I lost part of the point.  The second time I watched, the movie made much more sense and I understood why everything was so corny.  Give this one a shot if you like children's movies.",1055116800,14,2185,4.712401055408971
1397467,1,B000056HQ8,"There is no other way to express it, other than to say that ""North"" is a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.  This movie is so patently awful that it can't even be classified in the category of 'so bad it's good'.  For it to be in that category, it should at the very least have amusing moments and laughable dialogue.  Everything about this movie is just cringe-inducing.  Respected film critic, Roger Ebert, summed this movie up best when he said, ""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it.""  Those are his exact words(!), and I whole-heartedly agree.  The truly sad thing is, given the (in some cases, alleged) pedigree of all parties involved, this movie should be much better than it is.  Rob Reiner is a gifted director who has crafted such remarkable hits as ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""The American President"", and ""The Princess Bride"".  Why he would attach his name and agree to direct such dreck is beyond me.  In celebrity roast for Reiner a couple of years ago, he was chided often for this movie.  The actors should have also known better.  Names like Dan Akroyd, Kathy Bates, Bruce Willis (though still in his obnoxious ""Moonlighting"" frame of mind), Jason Alexander, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss should all add up to a better product.  The actor who plays the title character, Elijah Wood, is the worst part about this movie.  His acting can best be described as a horrible combination of whining, yelling, and sulking.  This was one of my earliest exposures to Elijah Wood and this movie was so awful that I have not cared for him as an actor since then.  It's a spectacular accomplishment for a movie to be this bad.
  The alleged plot of this movie focuses on a child prodigy named North (Wood).  He is supposed to representation of everything every parent wants their sons to be like.  He's the perfect kid.  Yet, all is not perfect in North's life.  He is a bit annoyed that his parents (Alexander and Dreyfuss) don't pay more attention to him than they already do.  So, he decides that, since every other set of parents in the world would love to have him as their kid, he should divorce his own parents (who are conveniently put in suspended animation after this) and go on a world-wide search for new parents.  Already makes you love the kid, eh?  Along the way, he 'auditions' new families from Texas, Alaska, and the Amish country (to name a few).  Each time, he finds some sort of imperfection with them and ends up throwing a whiny tantrum and sulking about it before moving on to the next 'candidate'.  During these scenes, the movie gets particularly insulting.  For each of these potential families, the script takes existing stereotypes about that particular demographic and amplifies tenfold.  There is some incomprehensible sub-plot about a megalomaniacal kid who seems to be using North's situation to further some plan to take over the world (at least that's what it seems like.  It really didn't make any sense).  In the end, North decides that he really IS happy with his own parents and returns to them.  I suppose the message is ""there's no place like home"", but 5 minutes of ""Wizard of Oz"" expressed it better than the whole of this movie.
  It is a monumental accomplishment for a movie to be this bad.  Do not even waste time watching it if it should appear on TV.  Even if my opinion doesn't sway, just remember the words of Roger Ebert.",1025827200,5,3396,4.631490787269682
1397468,1,B000056HQ8,"You know, people talk about bad movies. When seeing Bruce Willis as The Easter Bunny is the highlight of a movie...P>To say this movie is the worst I ever saw doesn't do it justice. I would be tempted to watch Mondo Trasho, a movie which caused me to need therapy, before I would watch this again (ok, that's an exaggeration... I didn;t need therapy, but I felt soiled after watching it).
Take a talented director, and tell him to remove all semblance of a real plot, good dialog, and good acting, and North would get an A+++++.... This has to be used as a movie to teach others how not to make a movie.
To this day, I can't take Elijah Wood seriously as an actor. It was only after I made that connection that I started to enjoy ""Lord of the Rings"".
On second thought, burn every copy of this film and remove it from human memory. This would be the kindest act that could be blessed upon humanity.",1013299200,10,898,4.288235294117647

1397472,3,B000056HQ8,"after having have watched it again this evening on television, i must say that complete and total honesty that YES this is not a great film, i do not wish to purchase this film - for family, relatives, friends, or any people i am acquainted with. but that's as far as i go. it's a bad film (in my opinion). nothing more, nothing less. there are plenty of tedious, monotonous, boring and awful films. there's probably more bad movies that have been made that are in circulation than there are good ones. am i to believe that people sincerely think that this one is the worst of a bad bunch? i cant argue personal opinion, i cannot disagree with individual preferrence...however... i also wholeheartedly believe that, at the same token, this movie is met with such harsh critisism and negative conotations purely because they have jumped straight onto the Roger Ebert (the most well known and respected movie review critic to exist) bandwagon. i have even read people quoting his wikipedia entry throughout all the comments.

i don't think the movie was great - it's heavily contrived. i think it's a disappointment to have such a star studded cast appear along side each other (John Lovitz, Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander and Dan Akroyd) only to produce a mediocre film. i think with actors and comical greats like that, the only thing that can be blamed for its failure is the script. the recipe for success was right there. the story of a child who goes globetrotting after divorcing his parents to find the perfect mother and father i think is very original. novel, but brilliant.
you must remember, this movie is targetted at kids. children around the age bracket of 12 and under. while i found seeing Bruce Willis sporting a bunny suit instead of a sub machine gun random and nonsensical, i think a childs response would be quite different.
i probably wouldn't reccomend this movie over any Disney animation films in existence. having said that i don't think an adolescent or toddler child would object to watching it either. extremely exaggerated reviews. hopefully Amazon filters them out.",1444780800,,2094,4.832869080779944

1397476,5,B000056HQ8,"NORTH is an 82 minute color movie, starring Elijah Wood as a ten year old boy named, ""North"" and Bruce Willis as character who appears in various scenes in this movie.  The plot can be revealed, in part, by disclosing the various characters played by Bruce Willis.

GENERAL THOUGHTS.  ""North"" is a work of comedic genius, with clever non-sequiturs and oddball references to popular culture.  These oddball references include:  (1) The Coppertone Girl, from an advertisement by Schering-Plough; (2) The whistled tune from the Andy Griffith show, where Ronnie Howard and Andy Griffith go fishing; and (3) The stereotype of the French to adore the movies of Jerry Lewis.  ""North"" also has some rude comedic points, such as: (1) The brief reference to the inability of Governor Ho's wife to have children; (2) The ritual of Eskimos of sending the elderly off to die on an ice floe, and; (3) Bruce Willis' comments about hot weather in Miami.  The cinematography throughout is excellent.  Most of the scenes are drenching with bright colors, for example, the Hawaiian dance scene, and the cowboy costumes of Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd (potential foster parents in Texas) and of the troupe of singing cowboy and cowgirl dancers.

The plot makes use of transitions, as the main character ""North"" travels to various parts of the world to interview with perspective foster parents.  North travels, in his dream, from his home in New York (apparently not far from the garment district in Manhattan), to Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, Amish farm, China, Kenya, France, and another town in New York (Bedford).  In between these transitions, the plot has episodes showing a growing political movement of children in America to become dominant over their parents.  All of the transitions are coherent and they are done with superlative timing, consistency, and all contribute intelligently to the  development of the plot.

CHARACTERS PLAYED BY BRUCE WILLIS.  Willis first appears in an Easter bunny suit, where he has a seasonal job in a department store.  While in the department star, North falls asleep on a large leather recliner chair and has a dream.  Most of the film concerns the activities in this dream.  The dream takes place in North's home town, and then in Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, an Amish community, China, a tribal village in Kenya, Paris, in an upper class neighborhood in Bedford, New York, and finally in Greenwich Village and Central Park in New York City.

After appearing in the guise of an Easter bunny, Willis appears as a ranch hand at a large ranch in Texas, where he practices shooting tin cans.  Then, Willis appears as a beach bum on Kauai, where is explores the beaches with a metal detector.  And then, in an Eskimo village near Juneau, Alaska, Willis appears as the driver in a sleigh pulled by horses.  Eventually, at a convention of National Association of Smoke Alarms (NASA), Willis appears as a comedian on stage.  And finally, Willis appears as a Fed Ex driver, who drives North back home, thus concluding North's quest for an optimal set of parents on a happy note.  The film concludes when North wakes up from his dream, and Willis appears one last time with his Easter bunny suit, and drives North back home to his real parents' house at 35 Maple Street.

OPENING SCENES.  We see a boy's room, with various toys, e.g., train, walking penguin, Eskimo igloo with water-filled chamber with snow.  These toys represent actual scenes that occur later on in the movie.  At the dinner table, we see North's father (Jason Alexander) and mother at the table, ignoring North.  North tries to draw attention to himself by feigning a heart attack, but his parents still ignore him.  Then, the comedic aspects of this movie shoot up to a ten (ten on a scale of ten), and generally stay at this high level until the concluding moments of the movie.  North's father is a clothing inspector (a very humble job).  At the dinner table, he proclaims, ""Pants, that's what I know, I know pants . . . I grew up on jeans . . . let me remind you who I am, I'm NUMBER SIX.""  Here the father explains that he is the one who puts a tag of paper reading ""6"" in all of the pants that he inspects, and he says, ""I was inspecting pants before you were even wearing them,"" he brags to his son.

NORTH'S DOWNFALL.  The film shows North's track record as an over achiever at his school, in academics and in sports.  But because of being ignored by his parents, we then see his downfall.  He enters a science project, which is a weather vane that points in the opposite direcation of the wind.  A boy observes, ""Maybe its supposed to show us where the wind was.""  Then, a girl observes with sarcasm, ""What are we supposed to do with that information?""  North also fails in baseball.  Then, to seek solace, North escapes to his ""secret spot.""  We see him running through the woods, climbing over a log that bridges a stream, running past a treehouse, and finally arriving at a modern shopping mall, where he plants himself in a leather lounge chair.  Bruce Willis, employed as an Easter bunny by the shopping mall, befriends North and asks his name.  ""I'm North,"" he replies.  ""Willis says, ""I see your name on maps, very impressive!""

NORTH DISCLOSES HIS PROBLEMS.  North tells Willis that his big problem is not being appreciated by his parents.  During this discussion, North gets the idea of becoming a ""free agent,"" and getting adopted by a more suitable set of parents.  Then, North falls asleep in the leather chair, and for the next hour, what happens in the film is North's dream (though at this point, the movie does not tell us that it is a dream).

COMEDY IN THE PANTS TESTING FACILITY.  North wants to call his father at work, and this gives the film an opportunity to show how things operate.  We see a man in a golf suit, swinging a golf club, and testing golf pants.  In the next office, we see a man in a lumberjack suit, testing blue jeans, while swinging an axe.  In the next office, we see a man dressed as a German, testing short pants while doing a polka dance.  In the next office, we see North's father, dressed in a formal tuxedo.  While North speaks with his father on the phone, we see in the next office, a man in a Rabbi suit busily praying while swaying back and forth.  Truly, this type of comedy has only been matched by Monty Python's skit about paying money to have an argument.

CONNECTING WITH A LAWYER (AN AMBULANCE CHASER).  To set his plan in motion, North contacts a lawyer (Jon Lovitz).  Lovitz is shown driving a shabby automobile, in rapid pursuit of an ambulance.  This is a very clever pun on the metaphor ""ambulance chaser.""  Those in the know, will remember that John Travolta was an ""ambulance chaser"" in the movie, CIVIL ACTION.  Lovitz talks to North, saying, ""You do what I tell you to do . . . and before you know it, you'll have the best parents in the world.  What do you say kid?!?!""  By saying this, Lovitz explains most of the premise of the entire plot line.

Then, Lovitz adds extra humor to the ambulance chaser metaphor.  He explains, ""That's nothing, I just use it to beat the traffic.""  North's plan is eventually described in a newspaper.  The film shows various families in turmoil, battling it out when their own children threaten to become ""free agents.""  In one family, the film provides the dialogue, ""Come on Andy, his folks are going to fight it,"" says the father to his son Andy.  Here, the father is referring to North's parents attempting to fight North's plan to be a free agent.  Andy's mother agrees with the father, and Andy's mother says, ""They're not going to take it lying down.""  But then the film shows a great sight-gag, where North's parents faint dead away, collapsing, and lie down on the floor in an irreversible coma.  (Get it??? They're not going to take it lying down!  Get it???)  North's parents remain paralyzed during most of Noah's dream, including during an episode where there is a trial in a courtroom.  The judge proclaims that North must find a new set of parents by noon on Labor Day, or return to his real parents, and that if North fails he must go to an orphange

TEXAS RANCH.  The first set of prospective foster parents own a huge ranch in Texas.  A problem was that the couple's son had been killed in a stampede, and so that is why they want to adopt North.  During supper time, a dance troupe of 20 male and female dancers suddenly materialize in fancy cowboy costumes, and perform a glitzy song and dance routine, dancing on the floor and on the supper table.  A pretty cowgirl in a glitzy cowgirls suit, about ten years old, materializes on the table and gives North a cute, wholesome smile.  North and the two prospective parents are dressed in full cowboy regalia.  In the next scene, North sits on a fence with Bruce Willis (cowhand), discussing North's problems.  Willis give the advice, ""Sometimes when you're panning for gold, you try more than one stream.""

HAWAII.  North then travels to Kauai to interview with another set of prospective parents, Governor Ho and his wife.  We see the trademark coastline of Kauai, and the viewer is treated to a gorgeous rainbow over the north shore of Kauai.  The wife has been unable to bear any children.  They explain that ""aloha"" is used to say goodbye and hello.  ""Doesn't that get confusing,"" asks North.  ""Only when you're firing someone,"" replies Governor Ho.  We see North enjoying himself with his prospective family, swimming among tropical fish just off shore of Kauai.  Governor Ho explains, ""When you live in Hawaii, it is much easier to get into college.""  ""How's that,"" asks North.  ""Here in the islands, we have only 12 letters in the alphabet . . . since we don't use the letters B, C, D, E, and F, you are pretty much guaranteed to get straight As,"" replies Governor Ho.  (This is yet another example of the never-let-up comedy in this movie.)  Governor Ho explains the bountiful agriculture in Hawaii.  He explains, ""In fact there is only one barren area on the entire island, unfortunately it is Mrs. Ho.  But if all goes right, you will be our first child!""  (This is yet another example of the ingenious comedy in this movie, though married parents who are not able to conceive will not like this joke.)  Although Mrs. Ho is briefly downcast and sad for a moment, she recovers instantly, and exclaims to North, ""You will be our first child!""

COPPERTONE BOY IN THE IMAGE OF NORTH.  There is a colorful luau with many dancers in colorful costumes.  But then, to the crowd, Governor Ho announces a new marketing plan to encourage tourism.  It is a scheme to post billboards throughout the State of Hawaii, showing a picture of North in swimming trunks with a mechanical octopus (part of the billboard) repeatedly tugging down the rear section of the swimming trunks.  (This is a parody of the Coppertone girl, where a small dog pulls down the swimming trunks of the girl, only with Elijah Wood, it is an octopus.). North protests, and decides that he does not want to stay in Hawaii.  In the next scene, taking place on a beach, Willis materializes again.  North greets him with the name, ""Gabby!  What are you doing here,"" because in Texas it was the case that Bruce Willis was a ranch hand named Gabby.  But Willis, who is now a beach bum, replies, ""Who's Gabby.""  North explains his predicament with his parents.  ""Hang in kid, you'll get what you're looking for,"" replies Willis.

GROWING POLITICAL MOVEMENT.  Between episodes taking place in Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, and China, the movie shows the growing political movement amongst America's children, in their efforts to become free agents, and to gain control over their parents.  In these parts of the movie, what is charming is adult jingo regarding politics and legalese being ""put into the mouths of babes.""  But I do not describe this (not enough space).

ALASKA.  The scene in Alaska is just as astonishing and funny as those in Texas and Hawaii.  A team of ten dogs pulls a dogsled, bearing North and his prospective mother (Kathy Bates) and father.  The father presses a button on a garage door opener, and one of the walls made of snow in the family igloo raises up.  (This is a great sight gag.)  The dogsled enters the igloo.  The father opens a manhole cover in the center of the living room, revealing salmon swimming below.  Then comes a minute of astonishing comedy.  North holds a fishing pole.  The father holds a fishing pole.  As they fish, they both whistle the theme from Andy Griffith Show.  This is the tune where Ronnie Howard and Andy Griffith are going fishing.  Kathy Bates whistles the same tune.  (This is pure comedic genius!)  Kathy Bates is busy making a needlepoint weaving of penguins.  ""Ahh, this is the life!  Right son?"" exclaims the Eskimo father as they fish.  ""You'll be a source of great pride to the entire Eskimo community for many years to come,"" exclaims Kathy Bates with a broad smile.

But then something happens that makes North decide that these are not the right parents for him.  The grandfather comes down from his room in the igloo, and he is ready for his death ceremony.  This is for Eskimos who (as explained by Kathy Bates) are too old to contribute to society.  The family with North walk across the snow to the ice floe facility, where there is a line of a dozen old people, all waiting for their own ice floe, where they will be set adrift to eventually die alone.  We see one old man climbing on to his ice floe, where there is an easy chair and a color television.  He drifts away alone on the ice floe.  Then, the grandfather climbs on to his own ice floe, and drifts away.

On the sleigh ride back, pulled by two horses, Bruce Willis happens to be the sleigh driver.  ""Hey, its you,"" exclaims North.  Willis replies that he recognized North from recent stories on the news, and North and Willis discuss the impending deadline (noon on Labor Day).

AMISH.  The next family to visit is an Amish family in rural Pennsylvania.  North only needs a minute to decide that this is not the right place for him.  He is disgusted by the Amish, and politely says, ""I seem to have left my butter churn in the overhead compartment.""  And so, he turns and his airplane zooms off.

PARIS, FRANCE.  Then, North travels to China, Kenya, and Paris to meet other perspective parents.  The Parisian parents are busy watching a Jerry Lewis movie.  North realizes that the Jerry Lewis comedy IS JUST NOT FUNNY.  And so, he switches the channel, but it has a different Jerry Lewis movie.  Again, North turns the channel, only to get yet another Jerry Lewis movie.  And yet again, North switches the channel and gets yet a different Jerry Lewis movie.  (This is another great sight gag, making use of a well established stereotype.)

ENDING (SPOILER ALERT).  Finally, as part of his dream, North returns home.  North wakes up in the leather recliner chair in the department store, realizes that it was all a dream.  Then, he races home (to his real home) on 35 Maple Drive, and his parents are distraught because North had been away all afternoon for that day.  They all hug each other, and all is well.",1421712000,2,15161,4.640842421963144

1397483,1,B000056HQ8,"Maybe one of the reasons ""North"" ranks as a minor catastrophe on the level of the Titanic or the Hindenburg is the people involved are some of the standouts of the movie industry. Bruce Willis, Dan Ackroyd, Jason Alexander, Jon Lovitz, John Ritter, Annette Bening, and of course the director Rob Reiner are all involved in this film, which tells you this was not some of sort of cheap indie film made with lemonade stand money. Willis in particular keeps popping up as a different character, of course recognized by North, but never explained why he's there, other than to be cute. He keeps insisting he's someone different every time. At first, the movie didn't seem terrible, only just stupid, until Willis first appears--in a bunny suit. And then it goes downhill from there, plunging into the depths where many Ed Wood and similar fair are sitting on the proverbial ocean floor of bad cinema.

The premise is the idea of a kid wishing to divorce his parents. He then travels to more parts of the world than all the Indiana Jones movies combined. I guess what people found offensive in this film is the stereotypes of the many potential parents North meets on his quest for the right parents, both foreign and domestic. Over-the-top oil Texans, vain Hawiians, drab Amish, bead-wearing Africans, and the creme-de-la-creme, French enamored with Jerry Lewis. But the award for the most offensive part has to be the heartless Eskimos who send poor dear old gramps onto a piece of ice to float into oblivion. When North asks about why they are doing this, they reply it's his time. Sort of reminded me of the ""bring out your dead"" bit from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" where are an older man is being brought to the cart insisting ""But I'm not dead yet!""

Back at home, to pile on absurdity to more absurdity, North's parents have fallen into comas. But that's not the absurd part. They are on display in the Smithsonian Institute as the longest simultaneous coma in medical history. At the same time, kids all over the country are forcing their parents to be slaves lest they get a court injunction to divorce their parents like North. Starts making Ed Wood seem a little more intellectual.

I read that Reiner at one point thought that Ebert's review of this film was not as harsh if you ""read between the lines"", I know this is not true based on him saying that unseen demons took over his fingers as he wrote the review making his say he ""hated hated hated this movie."" While Roger Ebert deplored this movie as being offensive (and possibly ranking it lower than ""Plan Nine from Outer Space""), I found the resulting product how I would imagine if Ed Wood had been given a budget to direct a comedy. Some of the jokes are so bad they are funny, but funny for the wrong reasons. The jokes are so over-the-top which makes them sort of obviously sarcastic which is what makes it funny. Kind of in the same way lines from ""Plan Nine"" are funny, make you sort of half-life because of the sheer absurdity of it. The only line I found slightly original was the idea that adults could only go to R-Rated films if accompanied by a kid.

But you know, I think every great film talent has to be in and/or make a truly God-awful movie, or you really aren't a heavy hitter in the industry. Spielberg made ""1941"".

I didn't find anything offensive with the main plot of a boy finding new parents. North felt as many children feel that they are not given enough attention from their parents, and they were selfish. It's not like North is a brat or trouble maker, he's a typical high achieving, intelligent kid. So, where is the problem? Especially when the whole point and message of the plot comes out with the ending, it didn't intend or succeed in provoking children to want new parents. It was a great idea, great premise. It just wasn't written nearly as well as it could have been. It was a little all over the place - first it has a couple qualities of a mockumentary (like Reiner's 'This Is Spinal Tap'), then it's a storybook fantasy (like Reiner's 'Princess Bride'), then it has elements of a political melodrama with kids instead of adults. I think it should have stuck with the mockumentary style throughout. Also, many of the jokes are in very bad taste and some of the dialogue is hokey at best. Every other character here is seen as characatures so that North is the only normal character in the entire film.

Here is a movie so wrong-headed, wrong-hearted, wrong-made... so worng, you'd think the old axiom of a broken clock that's right twice a day would prove. But nope. It doesn't. Not by a long shot.

One of my most depressing experiences as a child was seeing Rob Reiner's ""North."" In fact, as extensive internet research has shown me, it was a painful experience for many as children and stayed with him throughout adulthood.

One of the worst movies of the year. One of the worst movies of the decade. One of the worst movies ever made. One of the worst ever. And when I say ""worst"", I'm comparing it to thinks like the Black Plague, the Holocaust, World Hunger, AIDS and Leperocy.

Elijah Wood is a wonderboy who is constantly ignored by his parents despite his best intentions and efforts that make most parents beam like the sun with pride. He spends a lot of time feeling ignored and sits in a chair in a furniture store at the mall to think. He decides he deserves better parents than the ones he's got (who doesn't?) and divorces them.

His folks are comatose from shock, but who cares? He's already in search of better ones.

He travels all over the globe and finds surrogate folks which are not right for him. Not loving, caring, nuturing... or very funny or interesting.

His best friend from school is enthusiastic about the divorce and gets the word out to all parents that children deserve better and thing better change or else.

I was actually in physical pain watching how badly the film's plot is handled.

While it is a thrill to see Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus together as a married couple and action legend Bruce Willis in an easter bunny suit... believe me, it doesn't last. The bad outweighs the good. Oh, HOW the bad outweights the good.

The big-name celebrity bit-players are many: Dan Aykroyd, Reba McEntire, Jon Lovitz, Bruce Willis, Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda, Richard Belzer, Ben Stein, Alexander Godunov, Kelly McGillis, John Ritter, Scarlett Johansson, Lauren Tom and Alan Arkin. Films with a big-name cast doing walk-ons is kind of tricky. Often this leads to a bunch of actors embarassing themselves in bit throwaway roles for a quickie paycheck and ""the sake of work."" It all really depends on the film itself--the screenplay and the director.

When a film with such a high pedigree of actors and filmmaker, Mr. Rob Reiner, you have to wonder why this whole damn thing went so incredibly wrong. And then kept going. And going and going. I am reminded of the legendary quote, ""Only those who dare to fail greatly, can achieve greatly."" And just about all who flaunt this picture have achieved greatly at one time or another. So... there you go. The ying to the yang.

The result can be ""Traffic"" or ""Gosford Park."" And the result can be ""Even Cowgirls Get The Blues"" of ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.""

You know, it's funny. When I first saw the trailer for ""North,"" I thought to myself, ""Wow. This looks like a good movie. I'm gonna see this one."" And yes, the trailer damn well made this look like a good one. It just goes to show you... advertisements can make anything look appealing. Hey, remember ""Babe: Pig In The City?"" The ads didn't make the movie look like much. But the movie was... wow.

Hey, come to think of it-- I would like to advise to eveyone who was unfortunate enough to see any more of this one that what they used for the trailers (so much as a frame more) to go out and rent ""Babe II."" It's an ideal antidote.

Of course, you may need a few days of bed rest and antibiotics right after seeing ""North,"" but after that... please... don't let this one put you off movies. Or any of the truly gifted people who were associated with this abomination.

Wood is one of the most talented actors ever to grace the business and the man seems unable to do a bad job on screen. Just check out ""Radio Flyer"" or "" for evidence. But hey, like I need to tell you, right?

But while his acting is on-par with Brando, Guiness, Hopkins and Kilmer, not every movie to come his way compliments his talents. Just after the disastrous misfire ""The Good Son,"" this one floated it's way into theaters like a chunky, nutty, crooked turd after a whole year of improper diet. Adding further insult to injury.

It is perplexing--to the point of going cross-eyed and your whole head exploding ""Scanners""-style--trying to figure out what in God's name the filmmakers were thinking.

Seriously, I actually picture Jesus H. Christ himself on the cross, thinking to himself, ""I died for this... ? If I'd known, I wouldn't have bothered.""

We all make mistakes, even collosal ones. Even the best of us.

Hell, especially the best of us!

Walt Disney was an anti-Semite. L. Ron Hubbard was a pedophile. R. Crumb is a racist and misogynistic sycophant. And I myself...

Well, I could go on, but you get the idea. Honestly, avoid this one about as much as you hepatitis A-through-Z. A sulfur plant leaves he aroma of an autumn meadow perfume compared to this one.

In summary, ""North"" is a childhood trauma that refuses to be repressed. For many, including myself. Don't let it be yours.

Still, we are all mortal. We are all human. We all make mistakes, we stumble, we falter.

No one of us are infallible. Rob Reiner has delivered us ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""The Sure Thing,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride"" and ""The American President."" Surely, we can forgive ""North."" Can't we?

""Only those who dare to fail greatly can achieve greatly.""

And Reiner has clearly done both. Let us at this as one of humanity's greatest follies... and try to find laughter in it. Not at the movie itself, which is clearly impossible, but at the movie's expense.

Like many Jewish comedians have done with WWII, the Holocaust and the years of slavery they were subjected to in Egypt, this is just one more thing we have to learn to laugh at. Not with, AT.

OK, Mr. Reiner. You are officially forgiven. Good luck... and let's hope another abomination like this isn't in the works.

Peace...

I know that the critics gave it poor reviews, but everyone that I know that has watched it loves it. I definitely recommend it to families. It is a classic 90's movie.",1192579200,,259,4.0
1397510,5,B000056HQ8,"I first saw this film when it came out in 1994, but was fighting health issues which made it impossible to get out and buy a VHS copy of the film.  Nice to see it available on Amazon.

It's hard not to love Elijah Wood in any role he plays. I knew when I first saw this film, this kid was destined to do something great in Hollywood: So guess who wasn't surprised when he got casted to play Frotto in the series of films entitled; ""Lord of the Rings"".  The books were great to read when I was in my teens, but I always had wondered who would play Frotto one day, when the books were made into films. Well, though Elijah had not been born yet back in those days of my youth, he makes a perfect Frotto in my view with the Trilogy of films.

I loved this film for a few odd reasons: Having grown up in a disfunctional, abusive family, like many in my generation experienced out of the 1960's; I had often wished I could have done what Hugh North (played by Elijah Wood) did in this film and that's divorce his parents. Hugh North is a bright wiz kid; great at scholastics, sports and anything he puts his hand to, whose parents don't seem to even have a clue what a great kid they got from heaven as a son.  Except in my case, I would have not gone back to my original parents if I had divorced them.  I think I might have settled for the family Hugh finds that had John Ritter as the father.  That would have been more my speed.

The film is certainly a light comedy with a profound message: ""As bad as anyone's parents might be, apparently, God in His wisdom picked the ones best suited for us"".  However, this does not mean the best laid plans of God don't go eschew when it comes to free will.  So it has been my long experience with life and living anyway; a message this film tries to also drive home it seems.

This film sort of has a happy ending, as Hugh's adventure, we find in the end, culiminates with him almost being murdered to save the cause to free all kids from their overbearing, controlling parents.  But instead of being shot, he wakes up and finds his entire adventure has been nothing more than a dream and that his parents really do love him. Otherwise, Hugh's adventures to find a different family are funny and fun to watch.  Elijah is adorable in this. This kid has one of the most pretty young male faces I've ever seen in kid actors.  What ashame no one thought to do a series of Astro Boy movies back in this time period.  Hollywood was staring at the perfect kid to play Astro Boy back then in my opinion. He looks just like the old 1963 anime character, both as Tobio and as Astro.

Bruce Willis, as I recall, first appeared on the Hollywood scene in the TV series ""Moonlighting"", long ago, when I was much younger. He plays Hugh's angel or conscience in all of this, while constantly appearing as different characters thoughout the story. Willis's characters play a Godly type presence, the part of unconditional love watching over Hugh North, never judging Hugh, but helping him to see what he has in the end ain't so bad.

John Lovitz plays Hugh's attorney.  Lovitz obviously had fun with the role; an easy role to play I might add.

Hugh's parents; played by Jason Alexander and Julia Louise Dreyfus are histerical as Hugh's parents, who, for the most part, stay in a comatose state throughout the majority of the film after they learn their son wants to divorce them.  In fact, the opening scene where Hugh North (Elijah Wood) is found sitting at the dining room table with his parents, listening to his parents not listen to each other, finds Hugh about to have a total anxiety attack he thinks is a heart attack, which only made me laugh histerically: The poor kid!

I could not help but think back to my own parents when they would talk and not listen to each other before they divorced each other when I was age 10, while fighting for each others attention and how I was constantly in the middle feeling I was being suffocated by their fighting to be heard.  I could equate in other words with Hugh North, except my scenario was not funny.  In fact, my generation came from allot of families like this, which is why my generation had such a high divorce rate as I grew up.

While I realize this film did not do well at the box office, it did well on TV simply for those of us who could equate to this type of scenario as kids.  One of the reason's why it did not do well at the box office might be because those from my own generation were only all too well reminded of the disfunctional home they grew up in and didn't want to be reminded.  Those who grew up in loving homes, I would think, would have trouble with this film, simply becaues it would look unreal to them.  For me, the reverse is true, looking at families that get along looks unreal to my own childhood, simlpy because I did not grow up in a family that got along all that well. So I suppose it depends on what side of the fence you are coming from in your experiences growing up, that make this film appealing or not appealing.

I was allot like Hugh North in this movie when I was growing up; extremely bright, a good kid, a prodigy, wanting to do right, but getting crucified by the family I grew up in.  Wish I might have had the option to make North's choice as a boy, which is why I like this film so much. It's a good fantasy for anyone who can equate to a family they wish they had not been born into.

For those of you who have children and order this film, you shouldn't think this film will give them any ideas if you are a family that respects and loves each other, however if you are not, it might give your kids ideas with the way our legal system is these days.  These days kids can divorce their parents if they want to.  Just know this stroy is fiction and actually allot of fun to watch.  Lots of top named stars were in this film and oddly enough the whole chemistry of the thing works for me.

The VHS tape came in surprisingly great shape.  No defects on the video tape or the box.  Delivery was on time.  No real complaints.  I'm so glad this was at least on VHS.  I've so wanted this in my library for years.  Thanks Amazon for making it available and now in my home library.",1181174400,2,6203,4.232597623089983

I mean even though Elijah Wood is the star, McCurley's acting was wonderful, so natural and just plain hilarious! He was the geek who made it big, the boy who gave North the idea.

1397513,3,B000056HQ8,"This movie is not intended to be taken seriously, and to watch it, you have to remember what it was like to be a kid. Kids are a little egocentric(some more than others) and that is where the humor comes in. The stereotypes of all the places North visits are a dead giveaway that this is how these places are percieved in a child's mind. Typical things most people hear about a place, such as the french people being obsessed with Jerry Lewis. I must reiterate, you cannot take it seriously. Those people that find it offensive completly miss the point. The point was that North is a typical kid who doesn't appreciate his parents. The fact that he sees his parents as not appreciative of him is what is typical of children, and what makes him so amusing and adorable. He is not unreasonable in expecting acknowledgement of all his acheievements, and his baffled expression when he tells his coach his problem is just so believable. I think any kid can relate. ""A child is born. He is given a life. And he is appreciated by everyone but the parents who gave him that life."" That's pretty close if not an exact quote. He doesn't whine when he says this. Just looks confused. And when you see the opening scene of his parents rambling on about their work problems not even listening to each other while North feins a heart attack, you have to agree there is a problem. But it's obvious that they do care, because they finally acknowledge him when he falls out of his chair onto the floor yelling dramatically. The point is parents aren't perfect, although this is an exaggeration of that point. This is one of the things North realizes at the end of the movie, and he is all the wiser for his outrageous adventures. I thought this movie was charming, but not the best family film I ever saw. It could've done without the inappropriate adult humor in some scenes, although most would go over young viewers heads. Like the scene where Bruce Willis is doing stand up and tells a tacky joke about sex, which is one of the more noticable examples. Otherwise, it's worth at least a rental if you have a light-hearted silly side and can relate to kids and their troubles. The celebrity cameos are very entertaining.",1111017600,24,2206,4.531328320802005
1397514,4,B000056HQ8,"I actually bought this movie by mistake, thinking that I had picked up Mr. North, the film adaptation of Thornton Wilder's book of the same name. The video lay around my house unviewed for some time after I bought it, and by the time I realized my error, it was too late to return it. So, I decided just to watch it and see what I had actually gotten.

Well, what I got was an enjoyable little fantasy/comedy directed by Rob Reiner. It centers around a terrific eleven year old kid named North (Elijah Wood)  who feels that, despite his scholastic, athletic, and thespian achievements, his parents just ignore him. So, he does the unthinkable. He gets himself an attorney. He gets a legal separation from his parents. He then travels the world, searching for the perfect parents. In doing so, he inadvertently causes a mini-revolution that puts kids in the driver's seat, as parents scramble to remain the parents of record.

There are some very funny moments throughout this film, which boasts a stellar cast. Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are well paired  as North's self-absorbed parents. Jon Lovitz plays the role of North's sleazy attorney. Bruce Willis is the sage that mysteriously appears in every vignette in which North is trying out new parents for size.  Probably the funniest potential new parents are those played by Reba McEntire and Dan Ackroyd. Moreover, one of the bonuses of having Reba McEntire in the film is that she sings in it and is simply terrific, as is the rest of the cast. This is definitely a funny little film that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.",1108944000,25,1594,4.740072202166065

I'm guessing it would work just fine in a dvd player but I can't be certain as I don't own one. If I'm honest, I don't  feel like that's the sellers fault but it's still an inconvenience.",1525651200,,288,3.8
