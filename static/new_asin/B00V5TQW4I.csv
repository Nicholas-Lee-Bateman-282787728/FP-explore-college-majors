8709387,5,B00V5TQW4I,AMAZING! I'm truly amazed the level of craftsmanship of the camera angles and the meticulous footage that they undertook to record this insanely event! WOW! East coast crowd was just as crazy as the West Coast crowd back from the 2011 event. The quality is phenomenal 5 stars plus! Thank you for this DVD!,1463443200,,305,4.666666666666667
8709388,4,B00V5TQW4I,"This concert was full of energy and gorgeous lighting. The colors are vivid and Hatsune and friends look excellent with their new projector leading to a much more solid look and better animation. The choreography is great and the overall performance was very good. I actually went to this concert in real life and it was as I remembered it. So why not a perfect score? Little things. When they go into a closeup of Miku and friends, the camera tends to lose a little bit of sharpness and focus. It's only a second or two but it is noticable. The song selection is limited to very popular songs or trendy stuff. There was not anything for hardened Miku fans. Sorry. Another thing was the lack of costume changes. If you have watched the Kansai concert from 2011, you get a lot of outfits. Here, you will get 3 outfits. This is something that Miku fans really like so it was probably a decision by the producers to market the Miku image.
Overall, this was an excellent nonstop concert, it is a single disk and the packaging is quality. Aside from the above complaints, the overall enjoyment of the program should be high. Sharing the world people. If Miku says it, you better do it.",1439856000,,1180,4.493023255813953
