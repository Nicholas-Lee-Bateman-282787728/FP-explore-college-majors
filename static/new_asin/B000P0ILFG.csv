8187960,3,B000P0ILFG,"This video was very well put together for a conference type format. I feel that conferences could be very interesting or boring but the speakers have powerpoint displays and slide shows which made it interesting. I took this dvd set to work and viewed it during lunch breaks (I viewed one speaker per break). I didn't know what to expect but I can say that I wasn't disappointed with it. The price was a bit high but then again there are 3 dvd's. If your looking for dramatic footage like on tv specials, this is not for you, but if your looking to see about what goes on at these conferences than this is a good representation.",1224288000,,628,4.3760683760683765
8187961,5,B000P0ILFG,"This 3-Disc set is chock-full of terrific presentations from top Bigfoot and Paranormal researchers, some from Pennsylvania, others from as far away as California. Eric Altman, the Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society Chairman, starts off the set with an overview of recent (at that time) activity in the Keystone State, featuring sightings and footprint finds, some of which are deemed hoaxes. Next, Daniel Perez gives an excellent presentation on the Patterson/Gimlin Movie, even inviting a 6'4"" man up to attempt to duplicate ""Patty's"" walk (which the man attempts rather clumsily but does not measure up to the creature in the film). Rounding out Disc 1 are two short interviews with Perez and Altman, as well as a photo presentation of investigations by the PBS and Pennsylvania Researchers Organization (PRO) into different hotspots of activity. Disc 2 has two excellent presentations, first one by Bigfoot/Paranormal researcher Travis McHenry, who explains that he is not of the opinion that Bigfoot is paranormal, but believes people may be seeing ghosts of Bigfoot in SOME cases, and also that Bigfoot is not necessarily connected to UFOs just because a person sees a BF coming out of a spacecraft. Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project gives an excellent presentation on some investigations he and his group conducted into activity in New Jersey and Georgia, the Georgia activity taking place over 40 years ago. William Dranginis is shown next giving a tour of his Bigfoot RV and the equipment he uses in the field. Disc 2 rounds out with interviews with McHenry and Frizzell and a photo gallery of the Conference. Disc 3 has two excellent presentations on ghosts by Rick Fisher and Rosemary Ellen Guiley, interviews with the two of them and the trailer for the DVD. The entire set is professionally done from top to bottom, absolutely top-notch, and all the speakers are clear and concise. Craig Hines did an absolutely excellent job on this entire set, and should be commended. EXCELSIOR!!!!!!",1205193600,2,1995,5.122699386503068
