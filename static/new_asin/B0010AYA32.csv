8237549,5,B0010AYA32,"I was expecting a little more insight on the daily life of a true hermit but interestingly this man was not a hermit in the true sense. Robert was a man with his own problems like everyone else but he was not so secluded and he didn't hate people. He was living in an abandoned bunker along a popular beach in North Carolina where he became more of a tourist attraction and had much attention from people...maybe too much...but it was clear he seemed to like the attention. Otherwise, a short (60 min) but great documentary of a man who was leading what I would call a pseudohermitic life in the spotlight with a sad ending. I would recommend it for those interested in learning about what this so called hermit has endured and experienced and for those wanting to know what could happen to a hermit who chooses the ""wrong"" place to be one.",1224028800,3,840,4.425806451612903
