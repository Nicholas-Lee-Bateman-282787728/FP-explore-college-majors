2958375,1,B00005QJJK,"Why was this movie so terrible? It started at first glance; the title. A Shogun is Japanese, whereas a Ninja is Chinese. A Shogun would never associate with a ninja, as ninja are without honor. A Shogun would only associate with Samurai.
Now we can get past this glaring error to the cheesy schlock that was the rest of this movie. From the soundtrack reminiscent of lower quality 70's porno flicks, to the unentertaining, poorly choreographed battles, poor acting, etc... do not waste precious minutes of your life watching this movie. After watching this movie I am honor-bound to commit Seppuku. Goodbye, cruel world.",1076544000,5,620,4.971153846153846
2958376,1,B00005QJJK,"The elevator music they play throughout the movie is unbearable.
The fight sequences were slow and corny. The leading character
looks like a doofus *not sonny*. Don't bother even looking for it at blockbuster.",1043539200,3,209,5.176470588235294
2958377,4,B00005QJJK,"This is one of those over-looked classic Ninja movies. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the picture transfer could have been much better. One of the  things that makes this movie great is the 70's music set to the fighting scenes, it fits perfectly. One thing is the realistic period costumes of the ninja (in other words they are not all dressed in black as today's Hollywood likes to portray but colors that would have been realistic for the environments they were working in), for example they wear camouflage, lite gray, and period dress, which is what they really wore. And the variety of the ninja is nice too, spider-ninja, monk-ninja, samurai-ninja, etc. also three different ninja clans battling each other. the action is on par with today's standards.  This is edge of your seat action!",1035072000,,802,4.762589928057554

Seriously, it wouldn't have been that hard to actually pronounce famous names and places like Hattori Hanzo, Tokugawa Ieyasu etc. They are after all, important figures in World and Japanese history. The action is poor, looks like a badly scripted ballet. There's almost no effects and you can tell that most of the actors didn't know anything about martial arts. There are attempts at comedy but poorly voiced dubs and mispronounced words makes it simply unwatchable most of the time. When you pronounce Kung Fu as Kung Fo in the movie you know it's just bad...even the most poorly written movies from the Hong Kong action cinema can get that right.",1371254400,,938,5.019230769230769

2958403,5,B00005QJJK,"Ok, so people are going to think I'm nuts for giving this 5 stars. Too bad. This movie is part of what I like about older Japanese samurai movies. No matter how you feel about the Cheesy dubbed voices, laughable dialogue cheap special effects, but still interesting none the less. The action is great, Hiroyuki Sanada (Last Samurai), the gorgeous Japanese actor was a surprise extra (actually the star along with Sonny Chiba)I didn't expect. He's about 21 yrs old in this and just beautiful(although I like his older face better). I didn't realize he was such a super athlete - a real revelation!

Further, the dubbing was terrible, reminded me of those cheaply made kung-fu movies of the 70's where the actors mouthing of the words are not in sync with what they are supposed to be saying.",1125964800,9,356,4.634920634920635
2958406,1,B00005QJJK,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!

Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it ""digital transfer"" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.

I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.

The first movie(there's 3)is Shogan's Ninja, a shogun is sent to wipe out the last members of a family. Hiroyuki is the protagonist whose parents were killed. He was sent into exile in China where he learns kung fu. He returns to avenge his family. There's swinging through trees and plenty of good sound effects, lots of intentional and unintentional humor. I really enjoyed it! The second is The Bodyguard where Sonny is an anti-drug vigilante who becomes a bodyguard to a mysterious woman.

Lots of action but pretty much run of the mill stuff. The third movie is The Legend of the 8 Samurai. About(again)the last survivor of a clan who is being hunted by the undead. The queen of the undead needs Shizu's blood to survive and stay young and beautiful. Lots of fantastical elements, great martial action, black magic and good laughs, also, a tiny little bit of nudity when Lady Tomasuza takes a bath in blood.

Considering this DVD is only 6 bucks or so, it's a good investment and a great addition if you are interested in the evolution of Samurai movies. Seeing Hiroyuki is a plus, it's really entertaining.",1096675200,11,1678,4.736301369863014
