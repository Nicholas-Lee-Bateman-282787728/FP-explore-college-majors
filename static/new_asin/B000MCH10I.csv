8283705,1,B000MCH10I,"Poor script, poor direction, insane music with ridiculous choreography.  The actress is extremely annoying.  The plot is not bad however poorly executed.  The only thing that deserves the praise is Bobby Deol's role and his performance. He is convincing as the thug, handles his character well.",1457222400,,294,5.3478260869565215
