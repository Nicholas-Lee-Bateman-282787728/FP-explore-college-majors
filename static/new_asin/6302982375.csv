My parents give this movie 5/5 stars, and they found Liv Ullman's directing to be moving and brilliantly done. They greatly enjoyed this movie (duh, they named me after it,) and once I see this movie, I will write my own review with my own opinions. Anyways, this review is for my parents! Oh, and I am 18 by the way, and I was born in 1993.",1316131200,,471,3.968421052631579
7835046,5,6302982375,"Sofie is a stunning piece of work that portrays the unresolved love a  Jewish woman has towards a Christian man, whom she chose not to marry. As  the story unfolds, the humanizing elements of Sofie's character become the  focalpoint. Empathy towards her struggle to accept the cards life has dealt  her is easily accomplished as Liv Ullmann brilliantly and sensitively  directs this fabulous work of art. Movies like this are a rare gem in the  world of high-budget, glitzy Hollywood action. It is so often forgotten  that a solid story line with richly established characters can be more  affectatious than a $100 million dollar budget. Five stars+! Don't be  intimidated by the subtitles. This drama will touch your heart. I share the  sentiments of the previous reviewer... this movie is hauntingly moving and  gripping!",969235200,13,823,5.067164179104478
