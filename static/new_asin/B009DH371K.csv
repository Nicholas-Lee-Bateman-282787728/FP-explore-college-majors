5319909,5,B009DH371K,"I could not believe how nice the picture was, it was better than the theatre!  I had to drive to a larger city to see this at the theater and apparantly their equipment is lacking because it looks BETTER  on my TV.  Anyone who is afraid of the quality of this blu-ray can buy without worry, the picture is fantastic.  I don't have a theater sound set up so I can't comment on that part of the disc, I was happy with the sound from my TV speaker but I know many people are more particular about their sound setups.  The concert  was the same content as the version they showed at the theater,  it contains the four breakaways with the four band members, which was not as annoying as I thought it would be.  Obviously I would have preferred an edit with the breakaways as an ""extra"", but with the original unedited film gone I am grateful we still had this.  The only extra on the disc is the documentary. I am very happy to have this concert on blu-ray.",1352592000,4,952,4.2154696132596685
5319910,5,B009DH371K,"The people who criticised  this Blu-ray disc for not including the full show as presented on the accompanying 2-CD set(I bought the Blu-ray + 2-CD set) have failed to read the booklet. The raw, uncut camera negative no longer exists. For ""Another One Bites The Dust"", ""Hello Mary Lou"" & ""(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care"" (if they were filmed), the film footage no longer exists.

My question concerns a new variation of DTS-HD Master Audio that is used on this disc. It is ""DTS-HD High Res Audio"". When played on my Oppo BDP-83 disc player(playing through an Integra DHC 9.9 A/V Processor), the audio is played as 4.0 audio(the subwoofer & center channel are silent). Has anyone else experienced this issue?",1352505600,13,712,4.780487804878049
5319911,5,B009DH371K,"This is a commanding Queen performance. The footage really captures each band member's enormous contribution to this epic concert. Freddie is in awesome form - his voice, his showmanship, his costume changes, his rapport with the audience, his bit with the flags - just all around undeniably incredible. Brian shines as usual with his tremendously talented playing and energized performance. Roger plays the drums with his intense immediacy and tenacity, thus earning the privilege of (almost) wearing Freddie's crown at the end. John's fierce performance and captivating bass lines add a complete exclamation point to the show. The personal moments with each band member throughout the performance are quite enchanting. The editing and vivid color and lighting of the footage is completely spectacular and does the concert total justice. This is indeed a very special capture of what makes Queen such an amazing, legendary band. Love it!",1352505600,19,938,5.387755102040816
5319912,3,B009DH371K,"I had this concert on VHS many years ago. I recall thinking it was okay, but Wembley was better. I was looking forward to the blu-ray release in hi-def since it was shot on 35mm film just like Queen Rock Montreal. The picture quality isn't nearly as good as Montreal.",1352332800,2,267,4.36
5319913,5,B009DH371K,"I owned this on VHS and LD back in the day... so I was curious as to how it would transfer to BR... and also the 16x9 crop as both previous editions were 4x3.
RESULTS?  it LOOKS GREAT!
Of course reading the liner notes in the lovely booklet enclosed reveal that this show was indeed filmed by Hungary's leading cinematographer/director who used every 35mm camera in the country and shot it on FILM not video.
As they say in the notes ""This is the last complete concert shot entirely on film. So junk that old laserdisc, throw the VHS in the bin and burn the bootleg.

HIGHLY Recommended!

PS...the repurposed nearly half hour documentary is fun and I particularly enjoy the large interview chunks with the retired John Deacon.",1352160000,43,726,4.612403100775194
5319914,5,B009DH371K,"Saw the concert in Sep at the Egytion Theatre in
Hollywood. Great concert. I would have to say Freddie's voice is the best I have heard him live.
Very good sound mix with Freddie's voice out front.  The camera as usual loves Freddie and he gets the bulk of screen time which is fine as this  show is a tribute to his greatness. On Blu Ray with a good home stereo system should sound even better",1352073600,,394,4.171052631578948
5319915,5,B009DH371K,"This is a terrific concert film of Queen's 1986 gig in Budapest. Although the shots/camera angles of drummer Roger Taylor onstage are frustrating during the first song or two - it's as if the camera crew struggled to get Taylor's face/head in the frame, clear of cymbals, tom-toms, etc. (Taylor is seen at better camera angles from song three or four on.) Be sure and get to the theater early (Sept. 27) or at least on time to see some 1986/85 in-studio footage and 1986-era interviews with all four members. There are at least three subtle hints by Mercury and the band during interviews that hint at Mercury's illness with HIV and, eventually, AIDs. When asked if Queen will return to Budapest to play another concert in the future, Mercury says, ""Well, I'll tell you what. If I'm alive, I'll come back."" Queen never did. 1986 was the last year they toured with Mercury - Mercury already was ill at the time. Another interesting comment in the film during the interview portion has Mercury saying, ""I want to make sure we're healthy to go out on the road again. I don't want to just go out there and do it."" There's excellent takes of ""Under Pressure,"" ""I Want to Break Free"" and ""It's A Kind of Magic"" included in the concert portion. Actually, all of the concert footage is good, and even the two or three mistakes have charm (Mercury's voice cracks once, but hey, it's live music, and he was already feeling the effects of cigarettes and HIV by the time they hit the road in 1986.) Leaving the theater, the viewer will agree that Queen easily is among the top five rock bands of all time, and Mercury's voice, preserved on Queen's albums and in their concert films, remains music's greatest male voice ever.",1348358400,55,1712,4.598039215686274
5319916,5,B009DH371K,"I saw this on at the movie theatre last night, and WOW! I was blown away. I adore the Wembly concert, but I think this one is at least as good, and perhaps better. Freddie's voice just soars, and i love hearing his choices, to harmonize a particular line, or punch another one. He's wonderful to watch, too, of course. Seeing him singing the folk tune in context was great. The video and audio quality were fabulous.
There are cut-aways to the four of them periodically, doing interviews, publicity events, and just hanging out. It was fun to see them in those contexts, too, and added to the movie.
It's more than just a concert. It's an event.
Sometimes after a really rough day, I'll watch Wembly, just to help cheer myself up, and soon I'll have a choice. Can't wait!
Enjoy, everyone!",1348185600,63,788,4.5174825174825175
5319917,5,B009DH371K,I am a big Queen fan and this is the best produced live concert of Queen I have seen. I have a number of their live performances on dvd. The is outstanding and Freddie is st his best. There are perhaps a few songs missing but this will be my go to queen video.,1499990400,,260,3.8333333333333335
5319918,4,B009DH371K,"I don't know if they are done cleaning out the queen archive yet.  This was a nice edition,  especially having it in HD.  Unfortunately,  I don't think they can do the same wonders to the wembley concert, which to me was just a tad superior.  The concert's great and there is a mini archival documentary entitled ""A Magic Year,"" which I think comes from the long OOP Magic Years collection.  It's a fun nostalgic piece.  Sound os great and video is great.  My only gripe is that a couple songs do get cut to the band in Budapest pre-show.  They're neat bits, but it does take from the joy of watching the concert straight through.  Minor gripe on an otherwise good disc, but for my money, the wembley show is a bit better.",1498262400,3,722,4.360902255639098

5319926,5,B009DH371K,"Queen's most successful tour and what sadly was to be their last with Freddie.  This concert showcases the band at the height of their power.  The way Freddie Mercury commands the audience and his vocal range will awe you as they belt out one hit after another.

This was the first rock concert that was allowed in Hungary and the government went all out to document the event.  Queen truly were the Champions!",1474848000,,410,4.575342465753424

5319941,5,B009DH371K,"Another great example of Queen in their glorious prime!
This isn't one concert shot in its entirety; instead it was put together using the footage that still existed.
Yet when you watch it, it doesn't feel like a cut and paste job, or sound like it.
As a Queen fan, for me this ranks up there with their 1981 concert in Montreal Blu-Ray.
My hat is off to all the folks who sought out the existing footage and presented it so well!
I play it with my home theater system...a Yamaha home theater receiver and Polk audio speakers and it sounds great!
I never had a chance to see Queen live while Freddie was still with us, so for me I love having the opportunity to see some of their greatest shows that still exist on film. MUST HAVE for Queen fans!",1440288000,,746,4.26056338028169

In my opinion this show is superior to Wembley, not only in technical presentation but in terms of the editing. The small vignettes showing the band offstage are left intact from the vhs version (albeit in a much higher quality), which provides a cool little ""behind the scenes"" view of the band during their downtime in Budapest. About as atmospheric as a concert movie can get. Highly recommended.",1429315200,,524,4.898876404494382

Real Queen fans will buy them all.  The performance leaves you wanting it to go on all night.  Freddie Mercury was a real showman.  This DVD was recorded and put together by a team in Hungary.  It came out fine with the performance 120 minutes long containing 24 songs.  The introduction shows the setup in fast motion and parts of Hungary.  The music and sound are in sync.  The DVD housing has a list of the songs on the back and a sizable booklet inside.  The music will test your stereo system.  There are no serious technical or performance defects here.

I think this particular dvd might be my favorite live show, however I'm SUCH a novice at this point that it's just too soon for me to choose a favorite.  I can only say that, at this juncture,  in 2014, at the age of 57, I'm a HUGE fan of all things Freddie and Queen.  Thanks to Amazon,  I have now purchased every dvd available, and I have absolutely no regrets about ANY of my purchases:  definitely money well spent.",1405728000,6,717,4.5390625

Freddy was all over the place--up and down stairs through the whole show. Amazing energy considering he was already sick. Of course, they were all brilliant and Freddy played well to the crowd of 80,000 people and they loved them/him. I loved them, but especially, him.
The special features were really great, as well. This DVD is highly recommended. If you're a Queen fan, this is a must.",1404864000,,555,4.791666666666667

When I ordered it, I had an estimated arrival date a week later, but that was changed and prolonged.  My only complaint is with the shipping and length of time.

Thankfully, the songs they do show are top-notch performances. I would recommend ""Live in Montreal"" for a bluray, and ""Queen on Fire"", the 1982 show from Milton Keynes for sheer performance quality-Hope they put that on bluray at some point.",1385164800,4,982,4.88622754491018

So after a long wait, here comes the Blu-ray version that closely resemble the Live at Wembley Stadium. You must forgive the picture quality a bit as it's transferred from the film in the 80's. Audio quality is good but I think the Wembley Stadium DVD sounded better (weird...I hope someone can testify and explain this finding).

I don't understand why the tracks ""Another One Bites The Dust"", ""Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart)"" have been lifted as compare to the Live at Wembley Stadium DVD. In any case, it's still a best buy and you should be happy to put it in your library. Enjoy!",1373068800,,774,4.443661971830986

5320043,5,B009DH371K,"Queen's newest 2-CD/DVD and/or 2-CD/Blu Ray package Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest '86 is a must for Queen fans.
This CD and DVD package was recorded and filmed on Queen's final tour with its classic lineup at Nepstadion in Budapest, Hungary on July 26, 1986 (a few weeks after the more famous shows from the demolished old Wembley Stadium in London on July 12, 1986). Unlike Wembley, this is singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass player John Deacon, drummer Roger Taylor and keyboard player Spike Edney warts and all live.
This is a killer show featuring a good mix of (then) new songs (The pulsing opener ""One Vision"", a killer ""A Kind of Magic"", a stunning ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" and a great but short ""Friends Will Be Friends"") and classic ones (""Tie Your Mother Down"" (in full on the CD), ""In the Lap of the Gods (Revisited)"", a short ""Seven Seas of Rhye"", ""Tear it Up (with a teaser of Liar)"", ""Under Pressure"", ""Another One Bites the Dust"" (only on the CD), the pulsing ""I Want to Break Free"", ""Now I'm Here"", the acoustic ""Love of My Life"" and ""Is This the World We Created"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Hammer to Fall"" (in full on the CD), ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" (in full on CD), ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"") and the band were playing with a fire that lacked on Wembley IMHO.
Also, there was a little jam called ""Looks Like Tonight's Gonna Be a Great Night"" (which is only on the CD) which showcased Freddie's dynamic vocal range and is better than the ""Impromptu"" that appeared on Wembley two weeks earlier and Brian May's 8 minute ""Guitar Solo"" (in full on the CD) which is one of his best guitar solo spots.
Also, the band decided to incorporate several 50's-era tunes into one medley (""You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)"" (only on the CD), ""Hello Mary Lou"" (also on the CD) and ""Tutti Fruitti"" (I believe extended on the CD as well) and also the traditional Hungarian folk song ""Tavasi Szel Vizet Arast"". Out of the three recorded documents of the Magic Tour (Live Magic, Live at Wembley Stadium and Hungarian Rhapsody), this is the best of the bunch IMHO.
Justin Shirley Smith and Joshua MacRae have done a great job restoring and remixing the entire show.
Also during the show, you get some footage of the band hanging out in Budapest (especially when Freddie asked how much the house of government was and if it was for sale).
Also on the DVD and Blu-Ray you get a bonus documentary on the Magic Tour which leads up to the shows in Budapest. Hungarian Rhapsody Live in Budapest is the peak of Queen on their Magic Tour.
This live album/DVD/Blu Ray is recommended!",1359936000,2,2640,4.571729957805907

5320053,5,B009DH371K,"As a lifelong fan of the band, I am bound to be biased in my review, but I was very excited to see a concert from the last tour in '86 (as a complete band) on Blu-Ray.
Whereas I liked Montreal, my favorite has always been the Wembley set - which is almost identical here.
The picture is as clear as I have ever seen footage of the band, and the sound was crisp.

I wasn't particularly fond of the inter cutting scenes on each band member wondering around Budapest, having a ""moment"".
I would have rather this had been an optional feature on the disc, not played in the middle of a song, but that's just me.
With regard to the Wembley concert&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Live-at-Wembley-Stadium/dp/B005EVVPUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium</a>&nbsp;I live in hope that this will be given the restoration treatment and put onto Blu Ray - I'm sure it would certainly sell well.
Comparing that concert to this is not difficult, but for me the audience are flatter here, whether it's the camera work (which is great of the band) focusing on the band members more, and the crowd participation and reactions less I can't tell, but Wembley feels more immersive.

Another minor gripe, I don't know why Another One Bites the dust was left off the Blu Ray, or why Crazy little thing called love was heavily trimmed in the edit??
The impromptu bits, Brian's solo, and the very touching Hungarian song Freddie sings, are going to change depending on the location, obviously - but as for the song set, can't we have it all and complete?

Shelling out for this set will also give you two CD's of the gig, the less said about the crappy cardboard gate-fold sleeve the better.

Obviously a must for fans, for people new to Queen's music, I would recommend Wembley over this.",1357689600,,1837,4.878205128205129
5320054,5,B009DH371K,"First let me get my one gripe out of the way. Why do record labels insist on this eco-friendly packaging crap? Give me a sturdy/standard case (a 3 disc case is easy to put out) I do not plan on throwing away my cd/dvd cases so why make them eco friendly or biodegradable, make them strong and I'll be happy. This isn't anything that can take away from the five stars though. I will admit I love Queen and Freedie's vocals has to be one of the greatest vocalists of all time. That being said, I'm sure most of you probably agree to some degree otherwise you would not be reading further.

The blu ray looks and sounds great. I have never seen this on dvd or in any other incarnation so my opinion is just based on what I have in front of me. And trust me, if there was anything to gripe about I'd gripe lol. Because I hold Queen in such high esteem I'd want them presented in the best possible way.  Also anyone who has the Wembley dvd, do not worry, though most of the tracks are the same, the sound/performance is difference. It's like a totally new feeling. And I wish they'd come out with Wembley as well on Blu Ray. So if you are worried about it just being a duplicate of that one, do not worry this is a definite must have.

The songs themselves sound great and are well chosesn, as this is part of the Magic tour, it makes sense that it mirrors the Wembley arena one. The two cds are also great to have as well. I did not see the discs available seperate from the dvd, if it is ti's not remastered etc, so This was the best way to go. Though I like the cases like a standard blu ray comes in, they could have added a few little trays in the middle. I'm sorry but I just hate the packaging lol. The book/cover art is great though do not get me wrong..and I am not disappointed with my purchase (as there isn't a better alternative). Though it was a bit pricey, I can't see any real Queen fan really caring about that.

I could go on and on about the songs, but we all know them and they sound great live. I will add a point or two about Freddie, as this was the last tour he had with Queen. He simply owns his audience. Getting that huge of a stadium to clap rhythmically as a single entity is no small fete. He has them eating out of the palms of his hands. There is no air of arrogance mind you, just control. The audience loves Freddie and he loves them. It's like magic (pardon the pun) when he's on stage and they are so in tune with him. He looks comfortable on the stage and energized. He feeds off their love as if it's adrenaline.

The small documentary is a bit short at 27 minutes, and I believe I've seen bits of it in the behind the scenes of the Wembley DVD and/or Queen BBC documentary (another must have for fans). But it's still great to have. for the value of this Blu Ray and two cd set, I can't put a price on it, aside from the choice of cases I can't complain about anything. So if you love Queen or just good old fashioned Live rock 'n roll bands then you need this. Not just want, need. To many artists lip synch these days, this is a band at the top. Queen has never been a band of unequal players (think Wham!) Everyone contributes and everyone supports each other. Both in the music and the songwriting, that's probably why Queen is still so popular. No one can deny their talent, not after seeing this.",1357603200,,3336,4.126153846153846
5320055,5,B009DH371K,Fabulous concert.  Highlight is Freddie singing one of their folk songs for sure.  A must have for ANY Queen fan.  The out takes and excerpts are superb.,1356739200,,153,4.592592592592593
5320056,4,B009DH371K,"Excellent Blu-ray.  The set list is not much different from ""Wembley"", but it's still full of surprises.  The fact that this was shot on film, not video sets it apart from other Queen concert videos with it's amazing picture.  The cutaways of the band members rattling around Budapest was an interesting little addition.  We also get to hear John Deacon speak, which is a fun bonus.

  I'd recommend this to any Queen fan, or any fan of live music for that matter.  Queen prove that they're the best live act that's ever performed without inflatable pigs or giant video screens.  This is a perfect for fans of the band or for anyone looking to explore Queen's music.",1356652800,,666,4.6239316239316235
5320057,5,B009DH371K,"one of many memorable performances and in true Queen form, a must see performance, true Freddie Mercury performance, very memorable",1356652800,,131,5.6
5320058,5,B009DH371K,"Yes, it was basically the song list from Wembley, but don't let that prevent you from getting this. The Blu-ray picture and sound are both outstanding, and the band never sounded better. Freddy is in excellent voice here, maybe even a bit better than at Wembley. For me, the performance was beyond expectation. I look forward to watching it again and again!",1356393600,,357,4.774193548387097
5320059,4,B009DH371K,Great reprise of the essence of Queen at their best. The 35mm footage is special. A good trip down Memory Lane.,1356307200,,111,4.333333333333333

5320066,5,B009DH371K,"Well, I had seen this concert many times before and I actually had the vhs converted version on my compute for a long time!
Obviously finding out that this new release does not contain the entire unedited concert was a little disappointing but you have to be realistic! if the original full video does not exist, then what can you do? you gotta be happy with what is available! After all you have to appreciate their work on improving the picture quality which is very nicely done and the results is an enjoyable experience! I personally bought this to have in my collection to show to my new friends who are not very familiar with Queen and the amazing-ness of Freddie Mercury!

I would like to ask (beg) the Queen production team to now focus on officially releasing some of the great live performance of Queen in 70's! One of my favorite ones is Live at Hammersmith 1979 which is probably just sitting somewhere in the archives
You can add to the list Rainbow '74, Hammersmith '75, Hyde Park '76 and off course Houston'77 which I and a lot of fans believe deserve an official release!",1355270400,,1087,4.545918367346939
5320067,4,B009DH371K,"Yes, please!  Hungarian Rhapsody - Queen Live in Budapest may be the same songs you're used to from Queen's Live at Wembley and Live Magic albums, but it's still fantastic!

I'm a little disappointed in the actual Blu-Ray of the concert because it's actuallly missing songs that are on the CD's.  Four songs to be exact - Another One Bites the Dust, Looks Like It's Gonna Be A Good Night - Improv, You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care), and Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart).  While the last three are reasonable losses, how on Earth can you cut Another One Bites the Dust?!?

Still, if you bought this mainly for the CD's like I did, then you're going to get your monies worth just from them, and the Blu-Ray is just an added bonus.

I really wish that Queen would release more live albums from the past.  There have got to be a ton of them shelved somewhere.",1355184000,8,856,4.379746835443038

5320070,3,B009DH371K,It seems no matter what setting I have it on when I play it on my receiver it looks like Fred is lip syncing? There is a slight delay in the audio track? It seems to be ok when I use just the TV speakers. And I tried other concert blu rays like the new scorpions and it plays fine just like other blu ray movies? Anyone else having this problem or did I just get a bad copy?,1354838400,,374,3.7468354430379747

5320075,5,B009DH371K,"MORE QUEEN!! At their best, this concert is definately phenominal.. Especially when Freddie sings the old Hungarian folksong. That's pretty impressive that a star would go to that much trouble learning the song in Hungarian ( even if he looked at his palm a couple of times). I think after Live Aid and Montreal this is right up there.",1353542400,,335,4.694915254237288
