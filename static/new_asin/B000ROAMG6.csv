8202010,4,B000ROAMG6,"I like Alejandra very much and I'm glad that finally we have the option of having part of her videography, but I have to say that I would give without hesitation 5 stars, but the DVD set is kinda poor.
First of all, some very successful videos such as ""HACER EL AMOR CON OTRO"" or ""LA CIUDAD ARDIO"" are missing, there are no special features and they should have remastered with more quality her videos from the early 90's and finally I think that for some big hits that maybe didn't have videos , I think that live performances would have made this DVD production much more impressive. That's my negative opinion but not everything is negative. The videos are very good. As the DVD rolls you'll find more production and a much better performancer in Alejandra. In my opinion the best videos are her latest. The one with the best production is ""TU ERES MI LUZ"" from her 2004 release ""LIPSTICK"", the #1 hit ""VOLVERTE A AMAR"" has a very good video as also from her 2006 album ""INDELEBLE"", ""QUIERO ESTAR CONTIGO"".
I really recommend this DVD, you won't be sorry at all. Alejandra is a very good singer.",1188604800,4,1098,4.495
8202011,5,B000ROAMG6,"Alejandra Guzman, with her gutsy, gritty voice, and her wild and raunchy performance style, is one of the best rock vocalists today. She is the recipient of a 2002 Latin Grammy Award for her album ""Soy,"" as well as numerous other awards, including 2 from Premios Oye! Born in the D.F. in 1968, Guzman is a stunningly attractive woman, with an enviable figure and a face that recalls the beauty of her mother, actress Silvia Pinal. This collection of videos is in chronological order (except for tracks 4 and 5), starting with her mega hit ""Eternamente Bella,"" from 1991. The last 3 tracks are my favorites, and show that Guzman is definitely not getting older, but better. They show her with less of the excessive sexuality, and more sensual sophistication, and also less make-up, which accentuates her good looks.  The production of these videos (especially the early ones) uses every trick in the book, with lots of fast edits and clever costuming. My choice for best video and song is ""Volverte a Amar,"" which was a huge hit for Guzman in 2006, and is filmed in b&w. The DVD is approximately 43 minutes long, and the track list is:
1: ""Eternamente Bella"" (1991)
2: ""Reina de Corazones"" (1991)
3: ""Mala Hierba"" (1993)
4: ""Mirala, Miralo"" (1997)
5: ""Toda la Mitad"" (1996)
6: ""Enemigos"" (1999)
7: ""Diablo"" (2001)
8: ""De Verdad"" (2001)
9: ""Lipstick"" (2004)
10: ""Tu Eres Mi Luz"" (2004)
11: ""Volverte a Amar"" (2006)
12: ""Quiero Estar Contigo"" (2006)",1187136000,,1446,4.784
