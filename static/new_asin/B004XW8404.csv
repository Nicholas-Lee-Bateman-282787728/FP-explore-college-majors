4497700,5,B004XW8404,"I enjoy there Interview type video recordings, because they allow us, (the audience), to get acquainted with the artist. The Martins are one of the best trios around.",1380672000,,166,4.964285714285714
4497701,5,B004XW8404,A great overview of the Martin's music ministry as well as glimpses into their personalities. I like their versatility and they exhibit a wide range of it here on this DVD. I wouldn't consider the Martins southern gospel as their sound is more contemporary but they have a love of the Lord and that comes across strong in their work and their lives. I recommend this DVD highly.,1375056000,,378,4.573529411764706

4497703,5,B004XW8404,"The Martins' harmony has 'wowed' from the first time I heard them. On this dvd I was able to see the ease of their music is also who they are.

Thanks for the music",1355875200,3,227,4.022222222222222

8447504,4,B004XW8404,"First, as other have stated, the harmonies are excellent; Joyce, Jonathan, and Judy have a marvelous sound.  The a cappella numbers are some of the highlights of this DVD.  However, I cannot give it five stars -- this is primarily due to the overbearing interview of Bill Gaither.  Why Gaither needs to insert himself into all of these videos is beyond me.  I would much rather hear more music than all of the interviews -- especially Gaither's unnecessary commentary.",1425945600,2,468,4.886075949367089
