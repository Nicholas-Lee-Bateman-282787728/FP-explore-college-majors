4949290,5,B0064EGNO8,"When Buckley tells the Monsignor in all seriousness, that as a practicing Catholic he finds Mass on Sunday to be an aesthetic ordeal, he's speaking for millions of us who wonder where their Church went.  A serious and well argued discussion from all sides, and considering this episode aired some 34 years ago, amazingly current.  I highly recommend it.",1399680000,4,353,4.966101694915254
4949291,5,B0064EGNO8,"It was excellent - but too short!  LOL.  Davies had all his facts and citations on the tip of his tongue in his debate with Msgr Champlin, diocese of Syracuse, who seemed overwhelmed by Davies.  Davies is soooooo knowledgeable.  I hope someone writes his biography some day. (He died of prostate cancer.)  I was surprised that near the end of the 60 minute video former Jesuit priest Malachi Martin asked them both questions. I think it is well worth the $10 I paid.",1393718400,,466,4.566265060240964
4949292,5,B0064EGNO8,"Talk about an eye opener! Michael Davies is my new hero. He is a hero of our times. This is what Pope Benedict the XVI said about him on Davies passing.

I have been profoundly touched by the news of the death of Michael Davies. I had the good fortune to meet him several times and I found him as a man of deep faith and ready to embrace suffering. Ever since the Council he put all his energy into the service of the Faith and left us important publications especially about the Sacred Liturgy. Even though he suffered from the Church in many ways in his time, he always truly remained a man of the Church. He knew that the Lord founded His Church on the rock of St Peter and that the Faith can find its fullness and maturity only in union with the successor of St Peter. Therefore we can be confident that the Lord opened wide for him the gates of heaven. We commend his soul to the Lords mercy.

I highly recommend watching. Great stuff!",1380412800,4,967,4.273224043715847
4949293,5,B0064EGNO8,"I have been amazed with Davies for years now and I only wish I had been a traditionalist earlier in life so that I could have met the man.  Fr. Champlin, a supporter and facilitator of liturgical dance and a deliberately misleading proponent of the (at the time) illicit practice of communion in the hand is swiftly defeated and put to shame by Michael Davies.  Davies also takes Fr. Champlin to task in Chapter 11 of his book Pope Paul's New Mass for those interested.

This is a must view for every catholic and an absolute blessing to have on video seeing as not much Davies stuff is available on video these days (if anyone knows of more please leave a comment and tell me where to go).  Big thanks to the folks at the Hoover archives involved in getting this digitized and put online.

Pope Benedict XVI on Davies:

""I have been profoundly touched by the news of the death of Michael Davies. I had the good fortune to meet him several times and I found him as a man of deep faith and ready to embrace suffering. Ever since the Council he put all his energy into the service of the Faith and left us important publications especially about the Sacred Liturgy.

4949294,5,B0064EGNO8,"Four heavyweights in Catholic current events discuss the consequences of John Paul II's suspension of Hans Kung's canonical license to teach Catholic theology and the merits of Paul VI's ""New Mass"" which, by this time, has been in use in the USA for approximately ten years.  Malachi Martin and Michael Davies demonstrate complete understanding of the crisis facing the Catholic world in 1980, something that very few of their contemporaries did.
A convert to Catholicism at 21, Davies is 44 and is delightfully young in this interview.  He's at the pinnacle of his intellectual life, having already written groundbreaking books.  He's dripping in hard facts.  He offers the most cogent defense of Marcel Lefebvre and the Tridentine Rite that anyone had heard at the time becase these were years of great confusion.  Long before the rest of us had any idea of what we would confront by 2000, he offers listeners a precise analysis of the dangerous Liturgical Revolution unleashed by Pope John XXII's Council and Pope Paul VI's New Mass.  Likewise, he offers a clear cut understanding of the true nature of the Catholic priesthood.
Malachi Martin with two incisive questions makes his point.  He's scholarly, eminent and entirely above the fray.  Bill Buckley, always the intellectual, is the inquiring Catholic layman and journalist.
By contrast, in his Roman collar at a time when the Catholic hierarchy still enjoyed the tremendous respect and esteem of the laity, Msgr. Joseph Champlin is a ""liturgist"" and priest of the diocese of Syracuse.  He is a loyal son of the Council and represents all of the positions the other three participants find so questionable.  His defense of his position, always charitable, deferential, and gentle.... is never very convincing.
All four gentlemen are deceased.  Except for Msgr. Champlin, I followed them closely over the years and miss their brilliant insights very much.",1327190400,19,1913,5.158576051779935
8492510,5,B0064EGNO8,"God bless Michael Davies. The Catholic Church is going thru its Passion, Crucifixion and very dark times. It will soon be the 100 yr anniversary of Fatima and 500 yrs of Luther.

8492513,5,B0064EGNO8,"Fascinating to see the old stars of the traditional movement once more.  Many of the issues are the same today such as whether strict adherence to the Second Vatican Council is binding on Catholics.  The priest of the new rite was outgunned intellectually but did not really care since he had his  local bishop behind him. I wonder if he would make the same arguments today. Anyway, thanks so much for making it possible to refresh our memories and see these old timers in their more or less youthful days.",1439769600,2,506,4.6
8492514,5,B0064EGNO8,"This was the most historically insightful discussion I have ever encountered between the ""traditionalists"" and the ""reformers"".  Having encountered this struggle within the Church throughout my life, I can see the real confusion in hindsight.  Mr. Buckley talks about the privacy of the latin mass and his experience between God and himself.  He says that you can have a mass by yourself and that a congregation is not required.  At that point the Monsignor chimed in to the crux of the matter, but left me more than wanting in theological terms.  You are NEVER alone in a mass, even if the priest says Mass seemingly alone; The mass is the meeting of heaven and Earth- Christ is actually there present in body soul and divinity, and guess what HE brings along with him -all of heaven, ie all the Saints.  ""We wish to see Jesus"" and we do, and the mass is always a communal event.  Yes, the Father so loved the world that he sent down his Son as a sacrifice for our sins, but he did so that He may bring all together in his life.  The Father the Son AND the Holy Spirit.  It is so interesting to see how right a group of men can be without being righteous.

8492516,5,B0064EGNO8,"Muy bueno,
I am not very familiar with the firing line or its format, I wonder if it is normal for people ""to gang up"" on one person. It seems that the Msgr. was outgunned from the get-go. Mr. Davies, perhaps with a few too many smirks, makes some very, very thoughtful points that I will need to write down and research more into. Mr. Davies perhaps smirks, not so much out of arrogance, but rather, out of enjoying a good debate and winning. Dr. Martin is somebody I do not know enough about, seems to be intelligent but obviously not a neutral questioner (regular Firing Line format?).

Any-who, excellent and thought provoking.",1419811200,,631,4.584070796460177
