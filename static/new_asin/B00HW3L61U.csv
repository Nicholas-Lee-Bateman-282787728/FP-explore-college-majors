6230372,2,B00HW3L61U,"I'm a big William Holden fan, and lost westerns of the 70's but this film is a 'turkey'. Holden's family gets killed at the start of the film so he assembles a ""Magnificent 7"" group of killers he recruits from a Mexican prison. From there we get a long, ridiculous 'chase' film broken up by some gun battles and Holden getting nursed back to health by Susan Hayward (in her last theatrical film) doing a poor imitation of an Irish accent. Holden isn't bad in this while Ernest Borgnine who I also like--is terrible. Its a waste of time & money.",1405209600,2,544,4.396039603960396
6230373,4,B00HW3L61U,"Paramount and CBS DVD finally release this rare film to video. If I'm right, this movie never got a VHS release in The United States as I know of. I don't know why there giving it a chance on DVD? But I'm glad CBS and Paramount are giving it a chance.
The last time and the first that I saw The Revengers was on the cable channel TBS in the early to mid 1990s. And that is the only time that I remember it being shown. As years passed I always hoped it would be released to video so I could see it again. When I was at a store yesterday and browsing through the DVDs and Blu-rays to my surprise I seen this movie on the shelf for $12.98 on DVD. I was hoping for a Blu-Ray of it but as I found out later Paramount and CBS DVD didn't release it on Blu-Ray. No problem, I happy with The DVD. The Picture looks good and in Widescreen with a mono Audio track that sounds good. It's better than I thought it would be.
  Although this was a flop at the box office in 1972 and received mixed reviews from critics... It is still a good western movie to watch. One of William Holden's better later western's. Ranks will with The Wild Bunch (1969) and is better than Wild Rovers (1972). Two of Holden's later western's. Out of all three of these films, The Revengers would be considered the forgotten William Holden western. It reteams Holden with Wild Bunch costar Ernest Borgnine. Holden plays a Civil War veteran-turned-rancher that loses his family to renegades. Bent on revenge he hires six dangerous prisoners to even the odds a little on his hunt to take down the men that murdered his family. (Film takes ideas from The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Dirty Dozen (1967) you could say.) Also stars Woody Strode as one of the six prisoners, and Susan Hayward in her last film not long before she died. William Holden would have been in his early 50s when he did this film. But looks older. The hard drinking and smoking were catching up with him.
  This is a good movie to check out if you like westerns on the level with Magnificent Seven and The Wild Bunch. Rated PG for western violence and some language. If rerated my The MPAA, it would be PG-13 since that rating didn't exist in 1972. The violence can be bloody but it's not bloody like The Wild Bunch was.

6230438,3,B00HW3L61U,"How could this go wrong!? The cast is rad! Here's how..

The story meanders and repeats itself, which adds nothing but time to the movie and it's already tedious. They try out some goofy morality plays in it that simply don't work. The characters are very poorly developed.

The movie is close to 2, but I will give it one more try. But this is no hidden gem / unknown classic.

Also, if you like bad westerns that have no excuse for being bad, watch ""The Meanest Men in the West"", which stars Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin - one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1480377600,,566,4.271028037383178

William Holden as a rancher out to avenge the attack on his family. he has to go to Mexico to get those responsible so American law can't go. He hires 6 prisoners to help him get his revenge and there is part of the problem....convicts! Can they be trusted, relied on? Wonderful cast....they knew how to cast a movie back in the day. William Holden, superb, Ernest Borgnine, superb, Woody Strode, Superb the rest of the hunting party....SUPERB. WE also have a time with Susan Hayward at her very best! As westerns go this is at the top of my list and John Wayne is nowhere to be found!

6230497,4,B00HW3L61U,"I had never seen this movie, ""Revengers"", before; saw that it was now on DVD; I really like William Holden so I took a chance and purchased it.  It was a very good, action packed, western movie that had a good supporting cast.  Rancher Holden's family is massacred while he was away; is able to recruit from a Mexican prison six condemned men, including Ernest Borgnine and Woody Strode, to help him exact fatal revenge (sorta like Dirty Dozen).  Along the way there are many obstacles to overcome which makes this a very entertaining movie...not as good as the Wild Bunch, but if you want a good old, hard to find western movie staring Wm. Holden, this is your chance.  I recommend the movie.",1406505600,14,693,4.564516129032258
6230498,3,B00HW3L61U,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This is a highly lacking western that strays from any common sense.  It begins with an absurd and contrived ""attack"" on William Holden's ranch.  He sets off to Mexico where he picks up the most venomous and unlikeable convicts, mostly foreigners, for the big ""Revenge"".  Why they would help him is unknowable.  They are indecisive, swerving between following him and shooting him and leaving him for dead, which makes little sense.

Next they bust him out of the same prison they were in.

William Holden, and everyone else for that matter, have no redeeming qualities that make the viewer side with them at all.  They are riffraff and murderous, lecherous and loathsome.

One pointless action scene has Kiowa or Comanche Indians attacking an armed regiment of U.S. Cavalry in broad daylight.  William Holden and his bunch put sticks of TNT in the ground and by some means, are able to ""shoot"" them to explode.  Most Indians are killed off (about 100) and only one of William Holden's bunch is shot dead.  Why Kiowa or Comanche Indians would attack in such a manner is susceptible, because they would wait until dark.

A lot of ""horse tripping"" (Horse tripping is the practice of roping the front or hind legs of a galloping horse) is to be found here, most likely breaking a lot of horse  legs.  It is hard to watch.

By the weak ending, William Holden doesn't follow up on his big ""Revenge"" so the whole film is entirely pointless.

The only commendable quality of the film is the scenery, which is beautiful.  Filmed around Mexico, there's an old abandoned mining town with a rope-stayed foot/horse suspension bridge.  The town is ""Puente de Ojuela"" in the Chihuahuan Desert, of eastern Durango, Mexico.",1405468800,,1748,4.805369127516778
