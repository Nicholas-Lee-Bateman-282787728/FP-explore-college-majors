2639122,5,B000HLDDFG,"I definitely enjoyed this movie even though (spoiler alert) there is no happy ending.  It is unfortunate that so many people in our nation have such a distorted outlook on what the founding principles of our nation were.  I fear in 50 years, historians will be saying 'what the hell were they thinking back then' and they will look back on this film and get a glimpse into the minds of the people that took us over the cliff.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1160611200,9,446,4.481481481481482
2639123,5,B000HLDDFG,"Michael Shea and his crew have put together a disturbing and thought provoking film about the so called blue state/red state divide. Having traveled extensively in the USA myself and having many fundamentalist Christian relatives I can totally relate to this film. I have to agree with the depressing conclusion that Michael leaves us with at the end of the film; that many of these ""red state"" folks truly want to remake the United States into a weird capitalist theocracy based on the ""10 commandments"" from the old testament of the Christian bible. They use the Christian bible to justify torture, wars and racism.

If you ever wonder where the 30% who approve of George W Bush come from this movie will show you in spades their mindset and agenda.

Fundamentalism hasn't worked out too well for the Muslims, I don't think it will work out very well for the American Christians either.",1160352000,8,888,4.7973856209150325
2639124,5,B000HLDDFG,"Concept:  Excellent.  Purposeful, selfless, maintains the viewer's interest as the film unfolds both for the viewer and the filmmaker.  A pure documentary, the viewer gets the distinct impression that the filmmaker is truly interested in the topic, and that his outlook is subject to change if the process dictates.

Visuals:  Excellent.  Not only in terms of the beauty of the locations, but in the soothing movement across the frame.  It makes the viewer feel as if he/she is along for the ride.  The shots from the passenger seat while the filmmaker narrates at regular intervals moves the film forward very nicely.

Content:  Excellent.  Thoughtful content throughout.  Great Q and A.  Presented in a soothing conversational style with humor and sincerity.  The filmmaker asks sincerely and respectfully and then lets the subjects speak for themselves.  This is a film that will become more valuable as the years progress as a snapshot of a distinctly disturbing period in our country's history.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""Red States"".  The filmmaker's frustration with the points of view the subjects expressed is evident and disarming in its frankness.  I felt his discomfort with the subjects' nearly naked ignorance and hate.  Michael Shea proves himself a worthy documentarian, and reveals to the  public a truly balanced treatment of American political differences.",1160265600,17,1371,5.317757009345795

8140385,5,B000HLDDFG,"An interesting journey across America by a California Liberal in search of understanding what makes a ""Red State"" voter. While at times it seems that bias may be creeping into the interviews and the interstitial thoughts of the narrator, I think that the film actually uncovers the true beliefs and feelings of a large number of Americans...ones that they won't explicitly admit to, but are foremost in their values that shape beliefs.

Whether it is caused by lack of diversity in their lives, deep, unshakable Christian faith, or simple ignorance, the film paints a very different portrait of what a ""conservative"" is from the main stream media. This film is worth watching if for nothing more than getting a set of data points that are more personal and intimate than statistics and analysis can provide.",1446163200,,807,4.977777777777778

8140387,4,B000HLDDFG,"This film is a documentary about religion,  a liberal trying to understand the beliefs of the extreme religious right. Unfortunately, the only aspect of the political spectrum that was explored was abortion and gay rights.  I'm a conservative but the issues that are important to me are economic and social. These aspects of the Blue State, Red State issue are not addressed.

8140388,1,B000HLDDFG,"Wow, can blue state thinkers be more myopic than we think they already are. Typical of the approach to debate and discussions by the left in this country, you find all kinds of straw men here to protray the opposing point of view.

Instead, let's look at the facts: under President George W. Bush - the United States leads one of the more successful global coalitions - one that even includes declared enemies.  He's rolled back Al-Qaeda worldwide, defeated attempts to continue attacks on the US homeland.  Al Qaeda now admits that Iraq was the central front (and that they're losing it).  And - oh yeah - he's liberated 43 million Muslims and he's strengthened NATO and now more and more European governments (Britain, France, Germany, Italy) want a closer relationship to America. The entire anti-war argument is based on one thing - it's messy.  That alone illustrates how out of touch the left is.  He's given us the booming economy which will give us the ability to address any number of economic equity issues - regardless of who wins in 2008.  He's put judges in place who won't legislate from the bench, and have restored respect for the constitution.  And he's done all this while protecting our civil liberties (unfounded charges notwithstanding).  In fact, under this administration, civil liberties have been restored to Americans that were beginning to erode under the previous administration.

But none of that is addressed here is it.  Instead, we get a discussion that pre-supposes that blue state thinking is more truthful, as if the last 30 years of history didn't happen.  Typically, liberals when confronted with their own incoherence, simply declare facts that challenge their world view as ""erroneous"" (see a previous reviewer).  Again, as if the last 30 years of history didn't happen.  Interestingly enough, this movie supports the now open liberal elite's agenda, which is we should all stop thinking, and hand power over to them, an unelected (not as smart as they think they are) intellectual elite.  Yeah, right.  Wow, how myopic can they be?  If liberals lose the 2008 election - what will they blame it on this time?  And if they win, can it survive the inevitable backlash of the US public in 2012

Thank God for the rational and realistic good sense of the American people.  It will eventually overcome the Red-Blue divide.",1214179200,4,2356,4.916455696202532
8140389,4,B000HLDDFG,"This was entertaining and eye opening. He interviewed people in a non confrontational manner which let these people tell their opinions without it turning into a shouting match. It definitely scares the heck out of me what many of the subjects in the film view as what kind of nation we are. They certainly must have missed all those history and social studies classes when they were in school. Maybe more frightening, is if they do remember what they were taught. This is recommended viewing.",1168819200,3,493,4.811764705882353
8140390,5,B000HLDDFG,"In this film, Michael Shea explores the thinking of 'Red Staters', that are still Bush supporters.

He takes the position of an interested observer and gives the people he is interviewing, the time and opportunity to express themselves, as they see themselves.

From my perspective as a long time resident of a 'Red State', I saw the mannerisms and heard the views of the sort of people that I have known all of my life. Though some may feel that Michael is painting these people and the South in a bad light through his choice of venue, its my experience that the views and beliefs expressed in the film are heartfelt. They are a true representation of many people that live in the Red States. I've known too many people, even in my own family, that will freely and openly state the views heard in the film, to see this film as an attack on Southern Culture.

My biggest surprise was in Michael Shea's personal journey. In the film he clearly comes to understand a world that he never knew existed. As he journeys in the film, he admits that his own prejudices changed as he meets with people face to face. Its a phenomenom that all of us that have travelled more than a little in our lives are familiar with, as we begin to see people of other cultures as caring and loving human beings.

It should be noted that Michael has shown us only a slice of the 'Red State' view. The film is not intended to be a survey of Southern Culture or beliefs.

My hope is that Blue Staters and Red Staters alike will find something in the film to help them find some common ground. Whether its a re-examination of our own beliefs or the understanding that we can cross the divide, through conversation and understanding.

It is difficult to see people as 'things', when you find yourself face to face with them.",1167609600,3,1797,4.446808510638298
8140391,4,B000HLDDFG,"It was an excellent movie. Michael Shea did a very good job.

It is scary to see and hear actual people that think so, extreme right here in the U.S. These people are Christian Al-Qaeda.  They are so extreme and so blind to the rest of the country/world. It's mind boggling. WOW!  Way to go Michael...",1165968000,5,301,4.339285714285714
8140392,5,B000HLDDFG,If you ever wondered if we were really living in two america wonder no more.  This movie shines the light on how differently red and blue america really see things.  If we are going to come back together we need to know where we stand and this film is a great starting place!,1161734400,13,275,4.169811320754717
8140393,4,B000HLDDFG,"I can't help but admire Michael Shea's courage and determination to go out there and try to understand the mindset of Americans who inhabit our ""red states."" The conclusion that he comes to is pretty depressing, though.

I also found it frustrating that he seemed to be getting some pretty good insight into the minds of red staters, but most of them probably walked away from the experience still completely clueless about the inner workings of blue state voters (although I doubt many of them actually possessed any curiosity about that to begin with). I guess I had hoped to see more of a two-way discussion, but it was mostly Michael just listening and gritting his teeth (I'd imagine) while they rattled off erroneous ""facts"" and gross stereotypes of liberals.

I certainly don't have any concrete answers to mend the red/blue chasm, but I think they may lie somewhere in the fact that liberals tend to inhabit crowded places that are populated with people of many different colors, religions, lifestyles and philosophies. We can't help but empathize with people who are quite different because we're exposed to their warmth and humanity on a regular basis. They're our friends, neighbors and even members of our own families.

In the film, Michael comments--when forced to confront red staters face-to-face--how difficult it is to continue to think of them simply as objects or obstacles that stand in the way of equal rights for everyone. Well, in my opinion, that's the key to it all. It seems to me that people automatically become more accepting of each other and their differences when they must exist side-by-side and constantly deal with each other. When they're allowed to isolate themselves and shut diversity out of their lives, that's when fear and intolerance tend to take over.",1160611200,11,1796,4.98
