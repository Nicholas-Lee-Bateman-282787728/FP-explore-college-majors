5312347,1,B009B82F3M,"I canceled my pre-order, because this is a wast of money for me, sence I already have season 1 and it is totally awsome. I recommend that you skip the movie and just buy season 1.",1357516800,,179,4.0
5312348,5,B009B82F3M,"Well i'll just put it out for all you ""Shana Fans"" ^^ The last time I saw the Shakugan No Shana movie I believe was 2006 and that was a looooooong time ago!! xD Reason I could still remember this title cause I watch very few animes!! ""I do watch anime but only the good one :D Getting off topic right now!! The reason I'm commenting on this product cause a.k.a ''Shana'' is not your typical school girl anime!! You could say ''Shana'' is from a world were Flame Haze's were born and raise. ''Shana'' is also been giving special powers to hunt down all the crimson denizens!! ""WARNING"" If you haven't seen the whole first season of Shakugan No Shana season 1 you should definitely ""WATCH IT!"" The Shana movie has like ""40 minutes"" clip scene from Season 1, but what you guys didn't realize that the remaining ""25 minutes"" of the movie is completely different. You could say its a retelling from the original first season-""BUT BETTER"" ^^",1348012800,7,935,4.5058823529411764

5312365,4,B009B82F3M,This movie is a rehash from season 1. There are many differences though. The fight with FRIAGNE is from season 1 in season 1 Shana does not get shot by him. One should see for yourself.,1413072000,,185,4.166666666666667
5312366,5,B009B82F3M,"This one good. But it has the part of the season one.  The opening act for this Anime.
I thought I made a mistake when I started the movie but I was wong!",1408147200,,154,3.6666666666666665
5312367,4,B009B82F3M,"Just about anyone who is a manga/anime fan knows this series- whether its because of Noizi Ito's character designs (known for work on many things, such as Haruhi Suzumiya), the light novels, the manga, or the TV series- every big anime fan has heard or seen this series that thrives on a combination of action, fantasy, surrealism, romance, and the concept of one's existence and purpose that surrounds it's well told tale.
With the movie adaptation, many who were only exposed to the TV series will be surprised to not only learn it all started with a novel series, but also that the movie is an adaptation that mixes elements and major plot points from the first three light novels, as well as some minor changes from the anime TV series, and some fresh reinterpretations and additions, as well as improved animation. (Whereas the manga is a straight up visual version of the events depicted from the novels alone).
If you enjoy Shakugan No Shana, and want a version of the story that follows the novels more accurately, this is for you. If you prefer the Friagne Arc as it was told in the anime, not for you. But if you're a strong fan of the series, makes a great addition to the collection.",1386028800,,1195,4.588785046728972
5312368,5,B009B82F3M,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,2,103,3.9523809523809526
5312369,5,B009B82F3M,"Some of the television show was cut down, but it goes into so much more detail up to the 1st battle. . .awesome.  Some movies is just cut, and cut.  This one concentrates on the 1st battle.  I like it.  Characters are more realistic in the movie. And it shows some of the other characters in the show with little tidbits. . .that was interesting.

Great battle scenes even though the background of the story is kind of sad where the main character is dead. . .but he's not really dead.",1378684800,,485,4.285714285714286
5312370,5,B009B82F3M,"So addicting, pulls you into a world that's unlike any other. Movie is a mash  up of the first season so not everything is there. Buy the first season of you want the full story.",1366156800,,178,4.085714285714285
5312371,3,B009B82F3M,"The Shakugan no Shana movie is a condensed retelling of the Friagne Arc from Season 1. It actually clarifies the villain's goals better than the tv series, and works as a nice transition in to the new voice actors. Unfortunately, the movie is very, very short and wastes what could have been a nice opportunity to develop the story arc a bit differently.

It isn't the most amazing anime movie out there, but it hardly qualifies as terrible. It is worth purchase, provided you understand it isn't an original feature film.",1363132800,5,522,4.736263736263736
5312372,1,B009B82F3M,"Very disappointed in this release. It's basically the first story arc of Shakugan no Shana Season One with some added scenes. Added scenes include: more explosions to the point of the anime becoming boring and redundant, some oddly shoehorned fan-service, and just nothing new to keep the viewer interested in continuing. I'm definitely hoping that Season 3 will help wash this awful taste away.",1362960000,3,395,5.1875
