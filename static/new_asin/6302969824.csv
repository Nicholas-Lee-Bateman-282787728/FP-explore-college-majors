7833599,5,6302969824,I remember seeing this film when I was young.  Ive been looking for it for years.  Unfortunatly I can only watch it on my computer as it is Region 2 format.  I did not know when I bought it that Region 2 is European format.  Now I know!,1388707200,,236,3.8541666666666665
7833600,4,6302969824,"Fancy a good heist movie? If you can dig up 1960's LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN from under whichever rock it's languishing, you are in for a fine time. It's available as a VHS copy or a Region 2 DVD. For Yanks, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN is one of the films in this Region 1 DVD collected set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eclipse-Series-25-Basil-Dearden-s-London-Underground-Sapphire-The-League-of-Gentlemen-Victim-All-Night-Long-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0047P5FTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eclipse Series 25: Basil Dearden's London Underground (Sapphire / The League of Gentlemen / Victim / All Night Long) (The Criterion Collection)</a>. Else, you may have to wait until it pops up on TCM's play rotation. But it's very much worth a peek.

It's a crackling yarn and a fine emissary of its genre. There's something about a heist film that allows the movie audience to sympathize with the crooks. Maybe it's got something to do with our innate blue collar distaste for them officious banking establishments. Anyway, we right away roll with Colonel Hyde (Jack Hawkins), an officer forced into retirement from the British Army and not too keen about it. It's not certain how much of the Colonel's turn to crime is motivated by his craving for a challenge versus his need for money. Hyde obviously relishes an exercise in problem solving. He applies his meticulous mind. He recruits seven disgraced soldiers to his venture, theorizing that no civilian entity stands a chance against the discipline and precise execution of the military trained. And he's right. That bank had no chance.

Any heist movie worth a damn gratifies its audience with a detailed approach to the mechanics of the crime. THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN walks us thru each step of the robbery. Reminiscent of that classic ""silent"" scene in RIFIFI, the bank robbery is initially executed without dialogue, until someone asks for a match, at which point things proceed to get loud and chaotic.

The ensemble cast - these crooks - is comprised of some of the UK's best character actors. Truly exceptional are the unctuous Nigel Patrick who naturally falls into the role of Hyde's second-in-command, Richard Attenborough as the unrepentant womanizer, and Roger Livesey as the mild-mannered pretend reverend. Livesey's hilarious standout scene has him - as outlined by Hyde - posing as a highly critical officer out to inspect a military base's kitchen. We meet each of these shady, neglected gents whom Hyde recruits thru his own sad introductory segment. Eight men in all, eight damaged goods. There's a sense of satisfaction derived from seeing these disparate personalities mesh and become a well-oiled machine. Almost palpable is this mournful undercurrent that exposes the somber, sometimes humiliating reality of a discarded soldier inhabiting a post-war England. War may be terrible, but it elevates certain men, after which the ensuing peace tosses them aside like so much detritus.

Often go awry the plans of mice and men and exact British hooligans. From jump, one glaring flaw in Col. Hyde's plan is the mettle of his men, their many foibles and weaknesses. Heist pictures made during this period often ended with either a collapse in the execution or a falling out among the crooks or the happenstance of sheer awful luck. We're led on a string up 'til the very end. It's a bit ironic that their inevitable ruination comes at the unwitting hands of he who ""synchronizes the watches.""",1359936000,,3494,5.347272727272728
7833601,5,6302969824,"This B&W gem from 1960 had a cast of UK actors who were either well known or became famous in the 1960's. The plot of de-mobbed British army officers applying their WWII military expertise to rob a bank has been covered by reviews elsewhere, but the film is well crafted and its understated English humour is amusingly delivered throughout. Very enjoyable.",1293148800,3,356,4.852459016393443
7833602,5,6302969824,"This movie might appear to be old fashioned, but it is a work of art from a bygone age when film making was a cherished art. Scripts were crafted and a story honed before fine actors took their places on the set. These were the days, in the UK at least, when there were no 'stars'. The actors all acted the part - and acted supremely well in whatever part they were given.

So it is with 'League of Gentlemen'. The cast ALL fit their parts admirably, to make a first class story come alive and very plausible.

This truly is a Classic although, being British, it is unlikely to gain the plaudits it truly deserves.",1246320000,,614,4.2844827586206895
7833603,4,6302969824,"Basil Dearden's seldom seen 1960 heist film The League of Gentlemen has provided the template for almost every significant heist film which has followed it from Oceans 11 to the Italian Job and others.

The film follows the exploits of Hyde (Jack Hawkins) an ex British military officer who has been forced into mandatory retirement as he plans and executes a major British bank robbery. Gathering around him a group of exmilitary experts he puts together a methodical robbery plan that he feels is gauranteed not to fail. The excellent ensemble cast includes Nigel Patrick (Race), Roger Livesey (Mycroft) and Richard Attenborough (Lexy).

The film starts rather slowly as the plan is hatched but then moves into overdrive as the actual planning of the robbery is organized. This is droll British comedy and takes some patience to get into but careful viewers will be rewarded. The film is a satire of British life as it moved from the rather rigid 1950's into the more freewheeling 1960's.

The comedy works because of the mood Dearden creates. Look for an especially funny arms depot robbery in the center of the film that successfully skewers British army life at the time. There is also a moral message that crime doesn't pay but I won't give away the details of how the robbery goes astray.

All in all a pleasurable viewing experience if one takes his time watching it. The film is only available on video from Homevision in Region 1 but there are no problems to speak of with the tape. The print is slightly faded but is not difficult to watch. The dialogue is crisp and clear even though slightly complex. This is a film to see if given the chance and if it can be found.

Highly recommended.",1187568000,2,1700,4.71043771043771
7833604,5,6302969824,"The movie's plot is well-described by other reviews. Look also for the scene where
Mr. Hawkins walks up the stairs in his house, past the portrait of his former wife,
and his reply to the inquiry re her status.  This VHS is about the only format readily available, except for DVD's which are Region 2 and therefore require a special player.
Even better than the picture is the book of the same title, published in 1958, by John Boland; the story is much the same,although the ending is darker.  It has taken some doing to find this book and it is pricey when found, but appears lately to be more on the market. (I read it when it was republished, right after the movie was made, but somehow was not inspired to a life of crime). The Gentlemen Reform (1961) and The Gentlemen at Large (1962) are sequels, also by Mr. Boland.",1095206400,,823,4.407894736842105
