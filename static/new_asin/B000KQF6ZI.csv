2696983,5,B000KQF6ZI,"I love 24, and have the box sets to Seasons 1-5.  Obviously I'm going to get Season 6 when it comes out, but now Fox has thrown this 'Premiere Set' of the first 4 Episodes of Season 6 into the mix.  Now, I would normally blow this off and wait for the complete box set, but at a local retailer I saw that if you bought this 'Premiere Set' for $9.99, you get  a $10.00 coupon off any season of 24, including the Season 6 box set when it comes out (the coupon doesn't expire until the end of February, 2008).  Well, seeing how I am gonna buy the Season 6 box set anyways, and between the 'Premiere Set' and the coupon you break even, it's a pretty sweet deal! If you're a die hard J.B. fan like my wife and I, I say go for it......",1168992000,14,729,3.938775510204082
2696984,4,B000KQF6ZI,"It's January.  Must be time for 24 to be off to another heart pounding start.

For the past 11 weeks, terrorists have been randomly attacking cities all over America with random suicide attacks.  President Wayne Palmer (DB Woodside) is desperate, so when a man calls and claims he can turn in the mastermind behind the terror, he'll agree to anything, including turning Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) over to be killed.

As so Jack's return from a Chinese prison camp is arranged, and a very broken Jack is turned over to the terrorist.  But if you think that this spells the end for our hero, you don't know Jack.

So far, this season seems to be a bit less exciting then the previous ones.  Of course, part of that may be because I saw most of the plot points coming before they happened.  There were one or two that took me by surprise, however.  I'm not sure I like the civil rights storyline either.  Kiefer's acting is amazing so far.  I believed he was a very different man in the first episode.  Of course, that changes far too quickly to be realistic.  But the show wouldn't be fun if it were realistic.

For those wondering about the DVD, you get the first four episodes of season six.  As a bonus, you get the first 12 minutes of episode five - basically until the first commercial break.  And there's a coupon good through February 2008 for ten dollars off any season set of 24, including season six.

Whether you buy this disc now or wait until the full season comes out is up to you.  All I know is I'll be tuning in Monday night to find out what happens next to Jack.",1168905600,13,1582,4.378006872852234
2696985,5,B000KQF6ZI,"24 is still #1 with me.  We've all heard it before...how many bad days can one man have.  The writers and directors are just incredible.  Of course the show wouldn't be what it is without the leading man, Kiefer Sutherland.  I loved watching the first 4 hours of this season 6.  The twist with Jack starting out from a down position is creativity in the writing.  Mixing it up is good.  For me it is all about the anticipation.  With Jack it has been pretty predictable of his style as an agent in the field.  Now we have to watch him bring himself back up to the level we know him best.  I have to say they pick some really excellent actors to join the cast and it is all good.  Thanks 24!!!",1168905600,4,692,4.12781954887218
2696986,4,B000KQF6ZI,"I've watched all 5 seasons- and still find this to be exciting TV. The first 5 hours of season 1 were in real time- with time it takes to drive across LA taking the same amount of time.

The last few seasons- the ""real time"" component has gone away- and if you can suspend belief- it's still a great show.

This season has Jack working with a ""reformed Islamic terrorist"" - because the shows creators can't keep casting Muslims as all bad guys. However, as any seasoned viewer knows- 24 can have more plot twists than a pretzel factory.

If you missed the first 4 episodes- or don't have the bandwidth to download the shows on the net- this DVD is the answer.

However- one must think that the boxed set at the end of the season will be cheaper. One must applaud FOX for trying this new way to distribute television programming. Now, if only HBO would do this for the Sopranos.",1168905600,3,877,4.361963190184049
2696987,4,B000KQF6ZI,"I like the idea of releasing the premiere on DVD but I don't know how much money it will make.  I don't think I will be buying it but I could see a niche market for it.

The first 4 hours of Day 6 didn't have the same level of excitement and action as Day 5, but I get the feeling they are building up to something bigger.  Also, there is a shocker at the end of the 4th hour.  All in all, it makes me want to watch more of the best show on Network TV.",1168905600,4,452,3.6288659793814433
2696988,5,B000KQF6ZI,These first 4 episodes may have more action in them than any of the first 4 episodes of any season of 24.  Jack's vulnerablity is also something fresh.  Best show on TV remains on top!,1168905600,7,184,4.228571428571429
2696989,2,B000KQF6ZI,"I just finished watching the first four episodes of 24 and I must admit...it is nowhere near as good as the previous 5 seasons. Four hours into the day I should be fully invested and so far I really could care less. Regina King is awful. She is a legalistic attorney who values civil rights over the lives of citizens. Oh and she happens to be the President's sister. (just when you thought the Kim Bauer type character was gone she comes back an rears her ugly head)! Oh and the only thing that really shocked me is that Jack had to kill someone. Well, usually that isn't a surprise but when you see who it is it will be.",1168905600,2,622,4.191666666666666

2696991,5,B000KQF6ZI,"Another great series! The DVD contains the first 4 episodes and part of the fifth. Can't wait to receive the full 6th Season.

2696992,4,B000KQF6ZI,"I must say that the idea of releasing just a few episodes of 24 so that people who missed the shows and didn't record them is a great $$$ idea.

Once again suspention of disbelief is the key to enjoying this series.  I like how Jack is tortured for two years and in two hours is all right.  My uncle was in Hanoi Hilton for six months, and I honestly don't know if he has fully recovered.  It certainly took him longer than a couple of hours.  I certainly wouldn't give a man like that a gun and put him on a high security job.  Oops, I lapsed into rational thought.

Aside from that, the rest of the eipsodes are great.  It is going to be hard for me to like Jack now or think that he is a 'hero' for killing Curtis.  I have to agree that the Yasser Arafat wannabe deserved a bullet from the man who's men he killed.  I guess there's not enough room on the show for two black men.  The new President better watch his back and make sure that CTU only hires white guys.

Since I have to wait until the rest of the DVD's are out to watch the other episodes, my hope is that Kim will return to the show only to be killed.  I would have given this 5 stars if it had happened in the first 4 hours!",1184803200,3,1192,3.937238493723849

2697003,5,B000KQF6ZI,"Major ice storm had our power out during the season premier. I was so glad to get this DVD! I'm not believing Wayne Palmer as the POTUS. He's too young, and lacks experience. And Jack Bauer desperately needs a vacation!",1172016000,4,219,4.5
2697004,5,B000KQF6ZI,"After being kidnapped, tortured and locked away in some far-off Chinese jail, I wondered how he could ever manage to get back. Here he is now! A special deal by the new black president (the late President Palmer's brother) made it possible. The price paid for his release must have been high and I bet, we'll hear about that later. A series of suicide-bombing attacks in major US-cities and (of course) in L.A., carried out by a new ruthless islamic super-terrorist and his fanatic followers, shakes the nation and forces the new President Palmer to harsh and nearly illegal reactions, proposed by the new presidential chief of staff. No wonder, the President's fair sister, a busy civil rights lawyer, pushes hard on her presidential brother to re-establish constitutional rights also for muslims held in special concentration camps by the government.

Jack is back to CTU to help stopping the terrorist threat. He soon discovers, that the so believed terrorist chief wants to quit terrorism and is therefore chased and compromised by the real super-baddie. Jack manages to contact the former terrorist who is willing to cooperate with the US authorities. CTU has to learn, that there are 5 small nuclear devices in the terrorists hand and all they need to use them against US-citizens is some electronic device to encode the trigger...and they really manage to get one.......BOOOOOM!!!!

It's really hard stuff being offered in the first four episodes of season 6! The tragic but inevitable death of agent Curtis brings Jack to his knees in sheer distress. Thank God, Chloe, the wonderful Chloe, is back and coveres Jack's operations. If you think, season 6 is just the same stuff like the seasons before, your dead-wrong!

2697009,5,B000KQF6ZI,"In our house, we watched this just a week after finishing season five.  Let me just summarize up front...excellent.  No wasted time here, the action starts immediately and doesn't let up.

There is a caution, as with all episodes of 24.  If you can't take the sight of blood, stay out.  Blood is the color of terrorism and  anti-terrorism.  The Islamofacists want ours, and Jack is eager to spill theirs.

Yes, in season 6 the writers have awoken from their dreams and remembered that the Islamofacists are the enemy.  The prize is western civilization and the tools are nukes.  This show is about today's reality.  If you are a Kosputin leftist, you will hate this show, and especially this season.  That's OK, we know where you cower and grovel.  Everyone else in America needs to see this.  They need to wake up from the MSM-induced lethargy they have been lulled into over the last three years.  I suggest you tie up your soccer-mom friends and force them to watch this against their wills until they give up the location of their apathy and stupidity.

Back to the DVD, it's bare bones.  No subtitles, no navigation tools.  It doesn't matter.  Jack's back.

As far as Meridith Viera, Katie Couric and Kieth Olberman are concerned, they should actually watch it, instead of reading the DNC talking points memo, then blasting it.",1171324800,2,1332,4.7336244541484715
2697010,5,B000KQF6ZI,"Up until season 6, I had never seen an episode of 24. For the past couple of years I've had to hear friends, family, and others rave about it, but I just wasn't willing to dedicate time to keeping up with a weekly tv show. This year, though, I caved in and I couldn't be more impressed.

When I hear someone say ""such and such is a good tv show"", the first thing that comes to mind is ""it may be good, but it's tv...how good can it really be?"". In the case of 24, good is an understatement. The show is well acted, well written, and the storylines and subplots keep you wanting more. Basically, a season of 24 is a 22 hour action movie with about a zillion twists and turns.

After the first 4 episodes of season 6, I was hooked. In fact, I happened to see season 1 on sale for $18 at a local Walmart, bought it, and I've already finished watching all 24 episodes! It's addicting! I just ordered season 2 the other day and am planning on getting the other seasons in the future so that I can catch up on what I've missed.

In the end, 24 is definitely worth sitting down and watching every Monday at 8:00pm.  If you havn't watched any of season 6 yet, you can buy this DVD to get caught up and only be a little bit behind...I think the upcoming episode will be the 7th of the season? You won't regret spending the $10.

As a side note, I will add that 24 isn't for everyone. The show is very intense to say the least (especially the 4 episodes on this DVD), and may end up being to much for some viewers.",1170979200,5,1504,4.0675675675675675
2697011,5,B000KQF6ZI,"Okay, I'll weigh in on this one on a couple fronts. I haven't bought this item, nor do I plan on buying it. That brings me to the first front.

Double-dipping. I hate studio double-dipping. For that reason I won't ever buy a ""preview"" or ""partial"" or ""single-disc volumatic"" set. I'm squarely in the camp that thing should be released complete or not at all. They did almost the same thing with the new Battlestar Galactica when they broke up the second season release into season 2.0 and 2.5 (releasing season 2.0 right after the first half season concluded and before the second half of the season started). This may be good for the die-hard DVD fan who wants everything ""right now"" and is willing to pay a premium for it. But to the rest of us it's double-dipping. What did we get for our money? Half a season's worth of episodes for the price we'd normally pay for a full season. That seems to be overkill on price and under-performance on price-to-content grounds.

Sorry, didn't mean to get off track there. But I feel much the same way about the ""teaser"" release as I do about other ""partial season"" sets. It's maybe nice for those who are willing to pay extra to get a sneak peek or get it before everyone else. For the rest of us, it's double-dipping. It'll be on the season set, probably with more features, so why buy it?

That said, I've watched the first few episodes on Broadcast TV, and it looks like this season will be in some regards a lot different from the first 5 seasons. It's moved into contemporary times, and deals with current issues of ""war-on-terror,"" free-speech, freedom-of-association, civil liberties, racial profiling, unjust imprisonment in ""detention centers"" (can we call them ""concentration camps?"") on religious/ethnic grounds. It looks like it'll be just as compelling and gritty, if no more so than previous seasons. So, I look forward to seeing the rest of the season play out. I'll probably wait until the complete season is released sometime late this year/early next year before buying it though. I won't encourage studios' double-dipping efforts.",1170288000,4,2091,4.786703601108033
2697012,5,B000KQF6ZI,"The stunning popularity of this DVD proves one thing: people are very worried about Islamofascist bad guys. They want to see them portrayed on the small screen as evil and cruel, want to see their patterns of wickedness and deception exposed, and want to see them defeated by patriotic Americans. This is very much the same way Nazi Germans and Imperialist Japanese were portrayed in movies during World War II, when Americans were looking for protectors and heroes to save them from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.

I think the big questions Fox had after Season 4, which was the last season when ""24"" pitted CTU against Muslim bad guys, was whether or not the public still wanted to see Islamic jihadists portrayed unsympathetically as villains, and whether or not Fox's studios would get blown up by an Islamic suicide bomber, if Fox dared to go ahead with such a portrayal. So far, the answer to the first question has been a resounding ""yes"", and the answer to the second question seems to be ""no"".

Packaging the first 4 episodes of Season 6 in a DVD probably was Fox's way of determining what the public wanted, and was 24's way of convincing the network corporate types that it would be profitable to launch such a politically incorrect season storyline (especially given the outcome of the recent mid-term elections). It's actually quite satisfying to note that ""politically incorrect"" has become increasingly synonymous with ""accurate"", ""meaningful"", and ""popular"".

There will doubtless be a major protest from CAIR, and from other pro-Muslim organizations, all claiming that Fox isn't being fair or balanced, that Fox is making life hard for American Muslims, and a bunch of allegations will be trotted out claiming that somebody's rights are being violated. It would be brilliant for Fox to counter by incorporating these well-known Islamist rhetorical strategies into the writing for later episodes in Season 6.

Here is the bottom line, folks: In the series ""24"", CTU is a US counter-terrorism unit based in LA. There is nobody who gets up before noon and eats safely with a pointed utensil who has failed to notice that the biggest terrorist threat to the USA and the Free World comes from Muslim extremists. If the series ""24"" pitted CTU against non-Muslim terrorists, it would look like the writers were bending over backwards to be politically correct, and the show would appeal to far fewer people by fading into irrelevance.",1170115200,8,2446,4.973105134474328
2697013,5,B000KQF6ZI,"This DVD is a great idea and a lifesaver.  Because of a blackout, we missed the first two hours of 24 and I thought we would have to wait until the boxed set.  We have done that before.

24 is one of my favorite shows.  I always wait for the twists and turns in the actions and the messages.  Nothing is politically correct on this show and I like it that way.",1170028800,9,360,3.9444444444444446
2697014,5,B000KQF6ZI,"Caution: some serious SPOILERS follow.

I've said it before, I'll say it again: There's a reason 24 won the Emmy as best dramatic TV show and Kiefer Sutherland won the best actor Emmy in 2006. 24 remains at the pinnacle of what's currently on the television airwaves, and, for my money, is the best out there at consistently crafting nail-biting suspense. This Season 6 (or Day 6) opener finds the forceful Wayne Palmer (D.B. Woodhouse) now as our United States President. It hasn't been an easy administration for him as, for the past eleven weeks and in ten different cities, a horrific barrage of terrorist acts has crippled our nation, acts which have been layed at the feet of one Hamri Al-Assad (Alexander Siddig, STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9). As Day 6 begins (at 6:00am), Counter Terrorist Unit agents believe they have a lead on Al-Assad, but their source, a man named Abu Fayed, will only divulge Al-Assad's location in exchange for Jack Bauer, against whom he harbors a serious grudge.

Accordingly, President Palmer negotiates with the Chinese, who had been holding Bauer captive and under interrogative torture for the past 20 months. Jack Bauer is promptly released, but CTU officers Bill Buchanan (James Morrison) and Curtis Manning (Roger R. Cross) are quick to note that their erstwhile top agent is now less than himself, seemingly hesitant and out of sorts. They also catch a glimpse of Jack's horribly scarred body. Nevertheless, they ask Jack to sacrifice his life for the greater good. Jack agrees.

Meanwhile, supporting subplots include Thomas Lennox (Peter MacNicol), a crucial member of the Presidential Staff, attempting to introduce certain mandates which, ostensibly, will aid the country's war against terrorism, but which, in actuality, might negatively impact our civil rights. On the civilian side, a young man of Middle-Eastern descent, Ahmed Amar (Kal Penn), watches as his father is arrested by the police on suspicion of terrorism. Immediately after, he finds himself being harassed by his frightened neighbors. Also, the Islamic-American Alliance finds itself under investigation as the FBI seeks to seize certain personnel files. However, Sandra Palmer (Regina King), an attorney who happens to be the President's sister, attempts to protect the Alliance.

Whew! I've already managed to catch the first four episodes, and, I have to say, all those events I've just jotted down are just the tip of the iceberg. In four hours, so much crap has already happened that the spoilers above are already old hat. I don't know how this show keeps doing it, keeps maintaining such a high level of suspense. Each successive episode only serves to make a complicated situation even more intricate.

And Jack Bauer has never been more vulnerable. 20 months in captivity has left him in a personal mess and unsure of himself. There are devastating moments in the show where you can sense him second-guessing himself, and the ending of the fourth episode left me utterly shocked.

The acting, as usual, is very key to making the viewer invest in the characters as well as buy into the premise, which, sorry to say, may not be so far-fetched as it seems. The actors, excepting one, are across-the-board superb. Let's start at the top. Kiefer Sutherland, who can put on expressions of bleakness and intensity like no one's business, is predictably magnificent. He effectively uses a certain stillness and an icy calmness to convey a gamut of emotions being held in check,and, yet, when the moment calls for it, he becomes a visceral actor as he lets loose with a ferocity that makes you aware Jack Bauer is someone to be reckoned with. I have to mention that, in the four episodes I've seen of Season 6, he reveals more stark emotion than in any prior season. In the first five seasons, he's managed to mostly publicly hold on to his detached demeanor in order to serve the bigger picture. Here, in his current vulnerable state, his personal feelings threaten to overcome him.

Having Wayne Palmer as our nation's leader is a nice twist and makes for a big change from the sneaky and cowardly former President Logan, while James Morrison, Mary Lynn Rajskub (as Chloe), and relative newcomers Carlo Rota (as Morris O'Brian) and Jayne Atkinson (Karen Hayes) provide excellent acting support. New arrivals lovely Marisol Nichol, the ferret-like Peter MacNicol, and Regina King are allegedly on the side of the good. Time will tell. With this show, I don't trust anybody, other than Jack. Alex Siddig is heartless and competently brutal as the suspected cause of the recent rash of terrorism, and he actually causes doubt to surface within Jack. Meanwhile, Kal Penn is about as far away from his Kumar character as he can get. Meanwhile, James Cromwell, Rena Sofer, Ricky Schroder, Kim Raver, and William Devane still await in the wings. By the way, the one actor who I feel doesn't pull his own weight is the very bland Eric Balfour, who plays CTU officer Milo Pressman.

Along with MONK and VERONICA MARS, 24 is one of my favorite shows. For sheer intensity, migraine-inducing plot twists, fierce action, and a resourceful, blood-and-guts hero who you can't help but root for, there really is nothing like 24. I understand why folks would rather wait for the complete Season Six instead of purchasing this dvd, which only contains the first four episodes (6am - 10am), but I'm seriously considering getting this, as well as the complete season, when it releases. It's that addictive.",1169251200,6,5497,4.973884657236126
2697015,5,B000KQF6ZI,"This is a great promotion for the series. Sure, FOX could have taken the high road like CBS, NBC or ABC and just offered the reruns free on their web site, but in the end this DVD serves a useful purpose. At least we don't have to sit through those horrible non-fast forwardable commercials on-line at the network web sites. And the $9.99 cost of the DVD is completely offset by a $10 coupon included with the set that can be applied to any full season of ""24"" including the eventual release of Season 6. So it's a wash. Plus you get the first 12 minutes of episode 5!

It is not unreasonable to believe that hundreds of thousands of people may have missed the premiere due to TiVo or VHS recorder errors or just plain forgetfulness. No one is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to purchase this DVD.

The fact that this DVD was sold out at my local Target, K-Mart and Wal-Mart stores and as I type this is ranked #7 on the Amazon DVD sales charts, proves there is indeed an audience wanting this DVD.",1169164800,18,1009,4.25

But, this DVD has no purpose other than to make extra $$$ for FOX.  Come on, just 4 episodes that was on TV the same week?  Why would anyone buy this?  Just enjoy the show on Monday nights and buy the full-season DVD in a few months.",1169078400,4,308,4.0
2697017,4,B000KQF6ZI,"For a suspense-driven TV show that attracts fans as polarizing as Dick Cheney and Barbra Streisand, ""24"" has sustained an impressive amount of momentum for the past five seasons based on its timely, post-9/11 premise of covering 24 hours in the derring-do life of federal agent Jack Bauer in his constant attempt to avert terrorist attacks in Los Angeles. The just-aired sixth-season premiere carries the same propulsive creative energy forward, and 20th Century Fox smartly seized a marketing opportunity to release the first four hours on DVD this week.

The action picks up twenty months after the end of season five when Jack was kidnapped and tortured by the Chinese for his role in killing the consulate dramatized in the prior season. A bedraggled Jack, looking like a palsied, late-period Howard Hughes, emerges from a plane looking and acting most fragile. An interesting plot development that has been dismissed for now, this vulnerability lasts roughly ten minutes as the old Jack comes back to form when it becomes clear that the country is being bombarded by small-scale terrorist attacks. As the key negotiating pawn, Jack has been freed to be the sacrificial lamb to terrorist Abu Fayed in return for mastermind al-Assad. After the departure of dastardly Charles Logan last season, the new U.S. President is David Palmer's callow young brother Wayne, who has haltingly brokered the deal. Meanwhile, complications occur when Jack finds out that al-Assad has decided to forsake terrorism for a pivotal role in his country's new government.

The first two hours are better than the next two, primarily because the set-up is so intriguingly far-fetched that the execution can't help but get somewhat perfunctory. The most egregious storyline involves a suburban family who get caught up in the day's activity through their connection with their seemingly innocent Islamic-American neighbor. Part of the problem is casting actor Kal Penn, star of ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"", as the poker-faced neighbor. The White House meetings also have a bit of a by-the-numbers feel to them, though a new character, White House Chief-of-Staff Thomas Lennox, livens the proceedings with his aggressive moves toward racial profiling, a most timely and controversial topic for the show to cover.

Familiar characters return - Bill Buchanan now officially heads up the CTU and is married to National Security Adviser Karen Hayes; and CTU analyst Chloe O'Brian, glammed up a bit more, is surrounded by a new supervisor and a co-worker who happens to be his ex-husband. New characters look promising, such as Lennox (an ideal part for Peter MacNichol's weasel-like persona) and Palmer's self-righteous sister Sandra, a civil rights attorney partnered with the head of the legal counselor for the Islamic-American Alliance. There is also a new CTU second-in-command, Nadia Yassir, who is helpfully fluent in Arabic. None of the actors particularly stand out, but Kiefer Sutherland's otherwise stoic turn is leavened by peeks into a more complex ambiguity this season. The rest of season looks promising especially with the sudden detonation at the climax.  The DVD's sole extra is an extended preview of the fifth episode.",1169078400,13,3221,5.236434108527132

Amazon should take this listing down!  The only people who will waste their money on this are those who don't read what it is they're getting and mistakenly order it believing they are buying the full season.

And who are those 3 idiots selling the supposed ""collectable"" versions?  What are they autographed by Kiefer Southerland himself?  Whats collectable about them?  They way they are listed its just same as the others, the only difference is they are trying to rip people off at a 1000% mark up!",1267315200,,735,4.473684210526316
