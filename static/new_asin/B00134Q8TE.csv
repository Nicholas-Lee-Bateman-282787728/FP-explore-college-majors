3101974,5,B00134Q8TE,"The documentary was great but there is more to tell.  After WW2, Guy got married and moved to Mexico where he was active in a  anti-communist campaign sponsored by the Mexican government called DCAA.  He got his private pilot's license and flew into variuos rural areas of Mexico where communist groups were most active in trying to organizie a Cuban style revolution.  From there, he moved back to the US and ran for Congress as a Republican in the Eastside of Los Angeles.  I was the Town Chairman of the Republican Party for Pico Rivera at the time and it was my job to keep his car in repair and walk precints with him.  Unfortunately for all of us, he didn't win.  In the late 60s, while I was in law school, I saw his name in a newspaper and wrote to him.  He was living in Ensenada, Mexico at the time and was piloting a fishing boat.  I lost track of him again until I found that he was appearing at an American Legion Hall in Boyle Heights CA and went to see him.  He had moved to Saipan, remarried, aged considerably, but was still flying.

The thing that struck me the most about the man was that he was sincere in everything he did and was not afraid to speak his mind.  They just don't make them like Guy anymore.",1290211200,8,1226,4.237068965517241

8249162,5,B00134Q8TE,Outstanding DVD on a valiant American hero.  PFC Gabaldon deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on Saipan during WWII.  Capturing over 1000 Japanese Marine single-handed is one of the greatest exploits in USMC history.  Producer Rubin did a wonderful job in using many clips of his life and lost interviews. Mr. Prinze narration is done with great respect and honor. I have ordered six and gifted four to veteran in the family. This DVD is very popular with friends and family.  I'm glad his gallantry on Saipan has made into a well- received motion picture.,1498003200,,578,4.86734693877551
8249163,5,B00134Q8TE,"Guy Gabaldon was this little tiny kid from East L.A., California who, at age 18, singlehandedly captured or persuaded over 2000 Japanese soldiers to surrender in WWII.  What's not to love about this true-to-life war hero documentary?  Real actual footage from WWII and from when he was in the news from the 1950's forward.

It's a great documentary.  I like it and I only wish I had known about this before he died in 2006.  His ancestors were colonizing New Mexico before there were settlers in New England.

Good price on Amazon.",1497916800,,531,4.717391304347826

8249165,5,B00134Q8TE,This is an amazing true story about a real American man of Mexican descent from East Los Angeles who single-handedly captured hundreds of Japanese in the Pacific theater during WWII.
