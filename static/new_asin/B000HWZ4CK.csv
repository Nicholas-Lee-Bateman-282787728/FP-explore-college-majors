2643860,2,B000HWZ4CK,"Although it's a great idea to feature both of these films as a 2-fer DVD, each one suffers from bad transfers. The worse of the two being ""In Hollywood"". There is a strange blue/gray blemmish at the top of the film that lasts throught the entire movie. While the films are not the best made by Abbott & Costello- thanks to MGM who never knew how to make comedies, they are still fun to watch and are a must for completist geeks like myself.",1167350400,18,440,4.25
2643861,2,B000HWZ4CK,"In my opinion this DVD release is a total slap in the face to Abbott & Costello fans. Warner home video should be ashamed of themselves with this release, the video transfer quality is absolutely terrible. After watching this double feature, it's evident that no amount of restoration went into this DVD release from Warner. While Abbott and Costello fans will find the movies funny, they won't be laughing over the video quality.

DVD Features:
Abbott and Costello in Hollywood theatrical trailer

2643946,3,B000HWZ4CK,"I enjoyed these films, but they are not the same as the others.  These are the films that were made much later on in their career, it seemed to me they did not have the same kind of connection as in the previous films, may have been a different director or something else, the bond between them just felt different some how, which didn't make it as hilarious.  It still had funny points and was still a great piece in to these two gentleman's lives from days ago.",1449446400,,463,4.25

This is my 1st DVD purhcase of an A&C film (all films I own are on VHS).  This is a great copy of both movies. I do have an upscaling DVD player so not sure if that makes a difference.  Anyway, for both movies, you can't beat this price.  The picture and sound is clear and would be a great addition to your A&C collection.",1332460800,,467,4.144444444444445
2644088,4,B000HWZ4CK,"I honestly only bought this 2-pk to get A&C in Hollywood.  My dad and I watch these together and he is the collector and needed that one.
The plot is the story mostly of a young man who gets his chance to make it big and get the girl, but is sabotaged by a rival.  A&C are 'helping' the young man.  There are good songs, romance, and of course great comedic routines.
I highly recommend this for your A&C collection.",1318723200,,416,4.175
2644089,5,B000HWZ4CK,2 films in one disc. Hard to find movies. Happy to see they made it to DVD finally. Love A n C. They don't make classics like these anymore.,1264809600,,140,3.8620689655172415

2644091,4,B000HWZ4CK,"The picture for both movies look fine. This is not a flipper disc. Both movies are on the same side of the disc. Both have English and French audio. Both have English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Abbott and Costello in Hollywood has a theatrical trailer. Lost in a Harem does not.",1234137600,19,283,4.568627450980392
2644092,4,B000HWZ4CK,"These 2 films were made for MGM (outside of their home studio of Universal). I remember spending weekend afternoons watching these 2 comedies on T.V. as a kid, and loving them.
""Lost In A Harem"" seems pretty by-the-numbers for an Arabian spoof. However, it's brightened by, of course, Bud & Lou's hilarious routines as they tangle with an evil sultan. There's even an outrageously surreal moment in which a hypnotizing ploy goes awry and the boys believe they are termites (!!); they both begin eating the furniture!
My personal pick is ""Abbott & Costello in Hollywood"", a fun romp in which the boys are set loose in Tinseltown. This gives bumbling Lou plenty of opportunities to harass the likes of Rags Ragland, Lucille Ball, etc. Playing Hollywood barbers who become agents for an up-and-coming young actor, they run afoul of an established (and very jealous) actor who will stop at nothing to stay at the top of the heap. Highlights include Bud teaching Lou how to shave a customer (done with lather, a balloon & a blade--you can just envision the results!); Lou posing as a prop dummy in a Western saloon scene ( I laughed until I cried here!); Lou the ""teacher"" getting outwitted by a class of Hollywood kids; and a rousing slapstick rollercoaster finale.
I gave the set only four stars because the distributors never bothered to clean up the prints--they still look scratched & blurred in places. Nor are there any featurettes, etc., about the boys or the making of the films.
However, I'm just glad they finally made it to DVD for their fans to enjoy!",1204675200,9,1559,4.756457564575646
2644093,3,B000HWZ4CK,Not their best or most memorable work but certainly solid entertainment for A & C fans.,1185840000,,87,4.5
2644094,5,B000HWZ4CK,"First, the issue of quality.  The only quality defect I noticed on my copy were vertical white lines and specks due to scratches on the film throughout parts of the ""Harem"". As far as I could tell, the quality of the transfer of ""In Hollywood"" is flawless. I already had these two movies on DVD-R burnt from laser disc, and the quality of these releases is no worse than that of the laser disc.  ""Lost In A Harem"" and ""In Hollywood"" are two movies Abbott & Costello did with MGM movies studios.  The boys almost sign with MGM before their lucrative deal with Universal, so to appease MGM for their near-miss, Universal allowed Abbott & Costello to film three movies with for MGM.  The other two being ""In Hollywood"", available on this disc, and "" Rio Rita"", mysteriously absent from this disc.  The twenty-eight movies Abbott & Costello released under Universal can be found on four separate volumes available just about anywhere.

Lost In A Harem has the boys as Vaudeville performers stranded and looking for any kind of work in a faraway Arabian land, accompanied by beautiful blonde singer Hazel Moon, played by Marilyn Maxwell.  All three are offered safe passage back home by Prince Ramo if they help him regain his thrown which was usurped by his villainous uncle Namativ. Throughout the movie, the boys dodge and evade all kinds of sandies and dunies who are threatening to kill them.  In one instance the boys even pretend to be Hollywood talent scouts to gain safe entry into the palace.  Twice the boys are captured and put in jail, where they run into a derelict with dementia, who goes crazy after hearing the word Pokomoko. While this is an unoriginal heist of The Three Stooges ""Niagara Falls"" routine, it contains enough discrepancies so as not to be a total rip-off.  In most if not all Abbott & Costello movies, politically incorrect humor, which sadly lacks in today's films, is very abundant. ""Lost In A Harem"" is no exception.  One classic scene between the boys and the villainous uncle, Natmativ question Costello's eyesight. The dialogue goes as follows:

Namativ: Eyes Bad?
Costello:  Is you?

Scenes such as the preceding make ""Harem"" a very enjoyable classic.

""In Hollywood"" has the boys working in a Hollywood barbershop. When an aspiring young actor/singer leaves his home town of Des Moines to search for fame in Hollywood, Abbott & Costello give up their hair-cutting gig to become his agents.  The fast-flowing plot culminates in an amusement park movie set, including a chaotic chase scene atop a roller coaster, leading to an explosive ending.  As is the case in all A&C movies, ""In Hollywood"" involves a romantic sub-plot, in this case between the aspiring youngster and a former beauty salon worker and friend of the boys who has ""caught her break"" in the movie industry.  Skits here include Costello's first barbershop customer, Rags Raglan, who is in desperate need of a shave. That has disaster written all over it. Another hilarious skit features Costello being mistaken for a movie prop dummy by a director shooting an old West bar room brawl, and getting tossed all over the room! The obligatory (and much appreciated) politically incorrect scene has Costello disguised as an islamobaddie cab driver, equipped with a turban and beard, to avoid being detected. Why was he trying to avoid detection? I won't give that away. Watch the movie and find out.

There never has been another comedy duo quite like Abbott & Costello. These two movies confirm it! ""Lost In A Harem"" and ""In Hollywood"" will have you laughing for hours.  Now if only someone will release their third (actually first in chronological order) MGM film ""Rio Rita"", another classic!",1184716800,5,3689,4.862619808306709
