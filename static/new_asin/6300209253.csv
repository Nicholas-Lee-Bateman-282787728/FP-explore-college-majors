235484,2,6300209253,"You need to know that this is NOT a professionally produced DVD. Rather it is a burned (copied) DVD using a DVD-R. (Another reviewer questions the ""legality"" of this DVD but I don't know anything about this.) The DVD label and case insert are poorly done. The quality of the actual movie is fine and compares to other old B&W movies of the time that have been released on DVD. This is a good (not great) early John Wayne movie. My only concern is about the quality of the DVD that was used to burn this movie. Is it a high quality DVD or not? I don't know. So, how long will this DVD actually last. That remains to be seen. But, alas, this is apparently the only way to get War of the Wildcats (aka In Old Oklahoma). So, I would give the movie at least 3 stars, but the DVD only 2.",1298851200,9,781,4.077922077922078

235487,5,6300209253,"This a John Wayne film like no other. Take it from a huge fan that's seen most of his movies. Although this is not classified as a comedy, the Duke's turns in a sly performance full of great one-liners and facial expressions that had me rolling. Its action adventure in the oil fields and it's very entertaining and fun. Wayne is Cowboy Dan Somers and he competes with oilman Jim Gardner for oil lease rights on Indian land in Oklahoma, as well as for the favors of schoolteacher Cathy Allen. It has a good supporting cast including George ""Gabby"" Hayes.
  You will never see the Duke quite like this in any other role. If you're a fan of the Duke, this film is a must so track down a copy while you can. It was originally titled ""In Old Oklahoma"" and then reissued as ""War of the Wildcats"" If we cross our fingers, maybe this will be re-released on DVD as it deserves to be.",1069286400,33,875,4.296969696969697

235489,4,6300209253,"This movie was a pleasant surprise.  A great movie with all the elements of a Duke classic:  fist fights, Indians, love affairs, drunken debacle and tom foolery.  Duke is at his best with his one liners and Joe cool attitude.  Wayne's character in the movie (Dan) has shades of Wayne's characters in ""Red River"" and ""The Searchers""  Dan is so intent on getting 10,000 gallons of oil to Oklahoma, that he'll do it at any price.  He'll starve his men and forgo their dinners.  It takes the reason of a woman, Cathy (Martha Scott) to help Dan to not only think of a means to an end, but others' well being as well.
I highly recommend this movie.  Ranks right up there with my favorites, ""Red River"" ""El Dorado"" ""The Comancheros"" and ""Hondo""
Simply a classic....",986601600,17,758,4.522058823529412

235583,5,6300209253,"Full Disclosure: Anyone considering this personal recommendation for ""War of the Wildcats"", must consider that John Wayne was role model to our father growing up and by default us brothers grew up watching his movies, and JW has been a de facto role model to us brothers long after our father and JW had passed.

About every 18-24 months now, I'll go through what my wife calls the annual John Wayne movie phase, which means binge watching every John Wayne movie post John Ford's 'Stagecoach' going forward, virtually every other night for months.  War of the Wildcats is one of those older John Wayne movies that, I never bothered watching until around middle age (45), but in the spirit of traditional John Wayne movie, this movie is just as great as any other of JW's work.

Personally, movies like these seem to be falling by the wayside w today's younger generation(s) - (age 20ish to age 30ish).  But regardless what the younger generation may think, this promises to be an exceptional movie to watch, for any remote John Wayne fan (and his leading ladies were always spot on too).

235626,4,6300209253,"If you're a Duke fan this will be very enjoyable. While it is a Western, it's not a particularly grim reaper shoot'em up. It has some very light moments that a much younger Wayne pulls off very well in a sort of western romantic vein.

While I thought I had seen every John Wayne movie multiple times, this one seemed to have slipped by me somehow.  It's basically about a young beauty heading out on her own, meets a slightly villainous rich guy who's trying to take over the territory in Oklahoma's wildcatter oil rush days in the early 1900's.  The oil baron, with his own private railroad is about sweep the young lady off her feet when a young, charming Wayne steps into the scene.

As things progress, the young, down on his luck, cowboy becomes not only a romantic rival for the young lady's attention, but also a challenge to the rich oil baron's quest to monopolize the oil fields.

Gabby Hayes is also a welcome face in these old westerns, and you might want to pay attention to a young Dale Evans (before her Roy Rodgers' days) doing a stage bit of entertaining as a dance hall girl.

Some good old action here with some nice train scenes, oil well gushers, a saloon fight, and even some shooting.  If you like old-style westerns, this is a good watch.",1459209600,,1263,4.441558441558442
235627,3,6300209253,Pretty good early Wayne film. Fits in humor with the stereotype of the oil tycoon. Fun to watch the back and forth between them.  The school marm who wrote the racy book is a fun add on and the ensuing love triangle.,1459209600,,216,4.142857142857143

235859,3,6300209253,"This is a little better than the average John Wayne Western, lying somewhere in between his B Western past and feature films, to which he had been elevated in Stagecoach four years before. Set during the early 20th century Oklahoma oil boom, Wayne is a 19th century cowboy, not unlike the Ringo Kid, pushed into adapting towards the more technological world of the 20th century. Unfortunately, the landscape is straight out of the Southwest, but the plot, while predictable, offers enough dramatic tension to keep the story moving. Perceptive viewers might recognize Dale Evans as the lead saloon stage singer, her only scene. Gabby Hayes plays his familiar side-kick role.",1425254400,,673,5.127272727272727
