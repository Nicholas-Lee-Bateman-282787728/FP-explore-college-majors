4830499,3,B005LVIOYM,"I found the DVD set to be very good in quality. The problem is that the overall shows was not as good as the great Virginian shows were when the Virginian was at its peak. This shows needed to have some episodes with the enitre cast, most shows are with one of the stars which detracts from the series. I am glad I made the purchase but I can see why the show ended.",1325030400,9,366,3.9594594594594597
4830500,2,B005LVIOYM,"I was very disappointed.  I love the show ""The Virginian"" and this was nothing like it.  The first show was somewhat about the ranch and the owner and the next ones had nothing to do with the ranch and the people on it.

I returned it and was only given 1/2 of my money back.  Very dissatisfied!!!",1322956800,7,297,4.157894736842105
4830501,5,B005LVIOYM,"This was the final season of ""The Virginian"". They had changed the title and had moved the series on about 10 years. There was a new owner in Stewart Granger and James Drury had a new set of clothes and had grown his sideburns. Doug McClure was sporting a mustache as well as new get up. Lee Majors would also join the cast. There was also a new theme song by Ennio Morricone. This season would be different from the rest. They would rotate the stars each week so you would only see one of the main characters appear. They would mostly be away from the Shiloh Ranch on one adventure or another. This may be why the series ended as it didn't have the same feel about it and there was no family ambience to it. It could also be that the western was coming to an end and people were looking for something new. But this is still a great series sorely missed today.",1321747200,43,860,4.186746987951807
4830502,2,B005LVIOYM,"I so looked forward to the DVD release of this season. Having already purchased seasons 1 to 4 of The Virginian and simultainously pre ordered to release of Oct 25th 2011 season 5. I must say i am a little disapointed with this purchase. Why ? Well the standard of remastering just doesn't seem to be as good as the Virginian reissues. In episode nos 22, 23 and 24 the audio snync seems to be ever so slightly off with the video. Also the embossed tin seemed to be dented inwards, but this probably happened in transit. The opening theme seems to have alot of old film type sparkle in it on virtually all episodes.(maybe all, as I haven't checked all yet) I went straight to episode 22 (Town Killer) to check that it was in color as there was some doubt about this as it was shown more than once on tv in black and white. I was glad to see that it was indeed in color, but was very disapointed in the audio sync which I already mentioned. I have to say the standard of this set it way behind that of seasons 1 to 5. Plus the fact that the package took 3 wks to come to ireland from the US. Had i ordered from Amazon UK I would have recieved it much sooner and cheaper as i had to pay the Postman an extra 23.91 customs duty on top of what i paid already to pre order item. Also it seems to have come down in price since it's release date. So much for preordering! I'll be wiser in future.",1321315200,15,1388,4.069343065693431
4830503,5,B005LVIOYM,"Having seen nearly every episode of The Virginian and The Men From Shiloh, when they were originally broadcast (yes, I am that old), I would like to correct a minor point in Amazon's Editorial Review.  The timeline for The Men From Shiloh would have been, at the very least, the first decade of the 20th Century.  In the first season of The Virginian, he (the Virginian), Trampas and Steve joined Col. Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and fought in Cuba during The Spanish American War.  The year was 1898.  Several later episodes, in following years, referred to their combat experience.  To be chronologically correct, The Men from Shiloh should have taken place some time around 1908.  But, to be perfectly honest, I don't care what year they show on a calendar or the cornerstone of a building when watching an episode.  This is still one of the best series every created, based on a classic of American literature.  The Virginian, written by Owen Wister, was the first true ""cowboy"" story, a new genre that captured the country's Heart.  And now, in a time when it's becoming more and more difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys, and when the heroes have more character flaws than the villains, it's good to pop in a DVD and watch another morality play, and be reminded of some old fashioned values, such as duty and honor and truth; the same values that, sadly, are mocked and ridiculed today.  It's good to remember that some of the strongest, most devoted families aren't always related by blood.  It's good to remember that doing the right thing isn't always popular, isn't always rewarded, and may cost nearly everything you have, but you do it anyway, simply because it's the right thing to do.  And, after watching ""The Town Killer"" again, after forty years, I am still reminded of Ambrose Redmoon's words, ""Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.""  So...

Here's to the cowboy.  Long may he live.  Among us.",1317427200,127,1998,4.73121387283237
4830504,5,B005LVIOYM,"I am so excited that Men From Shiloh will be out on DVD.  I just loved this final season since Lee Majors was added to the cast, along with Stewart Granger.  Annette O'Toole is the first guest star, and the chemistry between her and Lee is pure magic.  I just finished reading Stewart Granger's biography, and it seems he didn't like many people including James Drury and Doug McClure. The only person he liked from MFS is Lee Majors, which explains why most of his episode are with Lee and not the other two.  He felt that doing a TV western was beneath him since he use to be a movie star for MGM.",1317168000,19,599,4.228070175438597
4830505,4,B005LVIOYM,"The Men From Shiloh is a greatly underrated series. It has been running on TV here (Australia) recently....after not being seen for nearly 40 years.

Different in style to its predecessor, The Virginian...as it it is set 10 years after the original series. Its ""star"", Stewart Granger, tries hard in the role of Col. McKenzie but the show really belongs to James Drury and Doug McClure. Surprisingly, even Lee Majors (not generally regarded as a ""great"" actor)has some memorable moments in the series.

One thing puzzles me...episode #22 ""The Town Killer"" has been broadcast in B&W both here and in the UK recently. I wonder if the color negative will be used for the DVD release? Or, is it another victim of the Untiversal Studios fire?",1315612800,27,737,4.841269841269841

4830511,2,B005LVIOYM,"This review is not about the dramatic quality of the original show content.

Basically, do NOT say it comes in an embossed tin when it doesn't.  That's not why I bought this set but false advertising is false advertising.  So do everyone a favor and remove all of that embossed tin hype from the description and change the image!

Visually, I got what I expected.  Not the best transfer quality but ... adequate.  It's watchable.  Don't expect anything resembling hi-def.  I only watched one episode and didn't experience the sound or sync problems someone else mentioned in a review.  Perhaps some episodes have problems but I couldn't say.

I know the quality is not perfect, they have a disclaimer at the beginning of their DVD's, so I don't expect HD but watchable quality, and that is here.

4830531,1,B005LVIOYM,"I really wish I could find something good to say about this set.  Lets see if I can 

TMFS begins with an intro that should have been a warning of what the show was to become.  I thought I was sliding into a bad version of the already bad spaghetti western genre.  This was reinforced by the theme orchestrated by Ennio Morrisone who produced some of music of Clint Eastwoods work in the area (only not as good).  For TV westerns you simply cant beat the ride in intros for The Virginian and Bonanza and others or the gunfight intros of Gunsmoke and The Rifleman.

Then, when I actually got into the first episodes, the settings and scenes were such that I expected anytime to hear Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head.  Ugh!  Although that may work with Butch Cassidy & Co., it is nauseating here.
TMFS series features some of the worst acting (by both the principals and guests) I have ever seen on TV westerns.  As bad as the acting is, it is surpassed by awful production and sets, terrible editing, scripts, music and sound.  It is painful to watch.  There are a few bright spots: good acting by Vera Miles (I am bias as she is a personal favorite of mine, therefore she can do no wrong); Burgess Meridith; the beautiful Brenda Benet (another personal favorite); Pernell Roberts; John Astin; Julie Harris; and a minor, but memorable appearance by Rex Allen.  The series showed some signs of improvement towards the end of the season, but it wasn't enough because all aspects of the show remained substandard.

I know the prior season had slipped in the ratings, however TMFS was not fitting way to end its run.  If this is the best the producers could do, The Virginian should have ended the prior year.  Overall, the years produced a fine series with good acting, especially by the principal actors.  With TMFS, the series did not end on a high note.  The best thing about TMFS I can say is: Thank goodness it wasn't renewed for another season.  I guess it was time",1404172800,6,1967,4.505649717514125

4830534,3,B005LVIOYM,I didn't like this season as well as the rest.  I think it was because they all seemed to be going their own way.  I felt like Shiloh was just not a priority.  I was glad to see Lee Majors in the show and I think he could have been a good addition in the other seasons but this one didn't work for me.,1398816000,4,301,3.671875

I debated buying it, but found it was done by the same company that did The Virginian. I do like this set. Love Stewart Granger in it. Once you get used to the new clothes and horses that James Drury and Doug McClure use you will like the show. The only thing I didn't like were the graphics at the beginning and that Shiloh itself wasn't used much.",1398816000,4,514,4.099009900990099
4830536,5,B005LVIOYM,"I have to admit I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should order it or not.  The ""Virginian"" was changed to ""The Men from Shiloh"" in order to attempt to improve the ratings and obtain a premium return on commercials.  I was surprised how really good it is. Stuart Granger, a retired English Colonel,  does a fine job of the lead role as the new owner of Shiloh ranch.  Lee Majors steps in as a new ranch hand and his episodes are the best of the 24 made.  James Drury and Doug McClure are still with the series and turn in great performances as always.  The episodes now focus on each of the individual characters and although the jovial interaction between the old crew is gone it works just as well.  I genuinely liked the show and can recommend the DVD.  I really do not understand the complaints about it not being pure ""Virginian"".  Oh, the musical theme has changed but the new one is awesome too.",1396656000,11,907,4.319526627218935

4830538,4,B005LVIOYM,"Picture is fine. Many fine stories as well. One episode was clearly based on an episode from Season 7, with minor changes (in an interesting coincidence Robert Fuller plays the villain in this episode while his Laramie costar John Smith played the same role in the Season 7 episode). Writers were rebounding a little bit from the intense pressure placed on them in Season 8 to not shoot down the villains, which hamstrung that season.

I miss the Graingers, and particularly miss Elizabeth (Sara Lane), and disappointingly no woman takes her place. But what I REALLY miss this season is the classic Virginian theme song by Percy Faith. This theme they use for 'Men From Shiloh' is not even comparable in quality, it's just not memorable. Why couldn't they at least have kept the theme? Oh well...",1392854400,6,796,4.810218978102189

4830559,3,B005LVIOYM,"...happens to be the oft-mentioned episode #22, ""The Town Killer.""  Ironically, that episode's b/w history in non-domestic markets might be the key to understanding why Timeless' release of MEN FROM SHILOH is literally a pale imitation of VIRGINIAN's vibrant mastering.  My guess is that U released this series for TV broadcasts in Australia and Europe ages ago when transfer quality was far less of an issue.  For some unknown reason, color elements for ""Town Killer"" were temporarily lost, so a b/w print was included in that generally sub-par syndication package.  But once a deal was made in 2011 to release the series on DVD in America with ""every episode in color,"" U felt obliged to replace that old b/w ""Town Killer"" with a color version, which obviously resurfaced.  And guess what?  ""Town Killer"" is complete, has no forced fades, cuts to black for commercial breaks just as it should, and looks absolutely superb -- just as good as THE VIRGINIAN episodes.  Simply compare ""Killer"" to the other shows in the Timeless set and the difference is dramatically apparent...  No whited-out faces or bleached landscapes, no pitch black day-for-night scenes.  Just gorgeous looking, first generation material.  I realize one reviewer mentioned that the sync in this particular episode may be off somewhat, an unfortunate Timeless glitch, if true; but the luminous 35mm negative used for the transfer is the real important news here.  It proves that U still has beautiful original elements on THE MEN FROM SHILOH, that Timeless' mostly disappointing DVD collection only represents what non-domestic markets have been stuck with in syndication all these years (except for the new, polished-up ""Town Killer"").  But you can be sure that if Encore Westerns decides to run this series at some point in the future, and they most likely will, it won't be the bleached, edited, and optically-doctored foreign syndie version we'll be seeing...  but a season's worth of shows taken from the same first generation negative source as ""Town Killer,"" which should be breathtaking.  So enjoy the watchable DVDs we have now, fans and TV historians, knowing that ""the real thing"" isn't lost and may come our way somewhere down the line...

4830560,4,B005LVIOYM,I grew up watching the Virginian and dearly loved the series.  Was not impressed with what the studio did with show.  I was not impressed with characters as written except for James Drury as the Virginian.  At least James Drury went out in style and stayed true to the image of the Virginian character. I have collected all of the series as it was released and will collect the last seasons as released.  The series is well worth having to watch and learn from.,1333584000,7,461,4.4523809523809526
4830561,4,B005LVIOYM,"I have been a big fan of the Virginian since I watched it with my family as a kid. I have purchased the first two seasons and the last season The Men from Shiloh. So far I have watched half of the TMFS shows and there is a big difference in the way the show was produced. Glenn A. Larson, I believe took the reins of producing the series and it just looks different from the original. The first run of the Virginian had great cinema photograghy and it looked fantastic with every show. Larson's production seems to have considered cost as a factor. In my opinion its not up to Frank Price's version. Any way I still love watching The men from Shiloh and the addition of Lee Majors as Tate was interesting since he just came off ABC's The Big Valley. If your a BIG fan of the Virginian and James Drury and the rest of the cast buy it! Four Stars from me.

4830563,2,B005LVIOYM,"What's missing from this DVD set?  About six minutes of footage on many of the episodes.  Also missing is broadcast quality picture and sound.  Also missing are bonus tracks.  The biggest problem of the three listed is the inexcusable practice of presenting 70-minute, edited copies instead of 76-minute, full-length network prints.  The artificial act breaks are amateurish.  The jumps into and out of black are awkward.  Re the second point, some of the transfers are horrible, especially when ""day-for-night"" scenes are included.  Images appear much too dark.  And yet some episodes' day scenes appear too bright, where portions of the screen turn bleached white.  The brightness problem is evident in many of the end titles.  Good sound is inconsistent.  In ""The Mysterious Mister Tate"" more than half of the episode occurs on a moving train, yet with no sound (effect) of the moving train.  Obviously Timeless is dealing with decent masters on some episodes and not-fit-for-broadcast masters of others.  Hey Timeless, thoroughly search the vaults -- not a half-assed effort -- and give us the best there is.  That's what we're paying for.  It's not like other DVD distributors are going to be putting ""The Men from Shiloh"" on the market and consumers can then choose the best.  This is our only shot, and you blew it.  The Universal logo appears at the conclusion of end titles on a few episodes (as it should), and not on others.  A bonus track with James Drury and Lee Majors or others discussing the much-anticipated re-tooling of ""The Virginian"" is sorely missing.  And have a knowledgable interviewer lead the discussion; don't let the stars ramble on and on with the result being minimal useful information.  How about having an assistant director, writer, studio/network executive or producer provide purchasers some ""Men from Shiloh"" insight?  How about including the 24 episodic trailers and some NBC promos?  Perhaps a better product box photo than the one of Drury, McClure and Granger with a ""cut-and-paste"" Majors.  So, what I want and expect from Timeless is NO edited prints, a higher standard of picture and audio mastering/duplication and bonus tracks.  Without that, the product warrants (only) two stars.  Haven't yet screened all the episodes, but I did enjoy ""Jenny"" with guest star Janet Leigh.  Compelling story and excellent location work in the desert.  A goof is obvious in the flashback where we see Drury and Leigh many years earlier as lovers.  Drury's dressed in the same shirt (or one very similar) to the one he's wearing throughout the episode! (and throughout ""The Men from Shiloh"").  And speaking of wardrobe, he looks better with a vest.  But a vest he doesn't wear in ""Shiloh,"" unlike ""The Virginian.""  A shame Drury didn't have as good a hair piece as John McIntire and Lee J. Cobb.  His toupee is embarrassing.  I was a big fan of ""The Virginian"" in its first run.  This DVD was a requested (highly-anticipated) Christmas present.  While there's some merit to ""The Men from Shiloh,"" the camaraderie and family feel of the Shiloh Ranch owners and their loved ones and employees and familiarity of the town of Medicine Bow evident throughout eight years of ""The Virginian"" are sorely missed.",1325116800,28,3233,5.011278195488722
4830564,3,B005LVIOYM,"The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh has okay episodes (including the outstanding Lady At The Bar, starring Greer Garson, E.G. Marshall, and James Whitmore, Jr.) but lacks the cohesiveness of having regular interaction between the main characters, especially Trampas and The Virginian. Other returning characters from earlier seasons include Sheriff Mark Abbott, who first appeared in 1962, and ranch hand Belden, who became a semi-regular beginning in 1963.

The laid back soundtrack, and, in one episode, background audio of a slow singing guitar player, both of which also appeared in Alias Smith and Jones and McCloud during that season, are misplaced here. The earlier seasons of The Virginian all look pristene on Encore Westerns cable channel, which will air them through the end of 2011, and are even more vivid on DVD season sets released by Timeless Media. The 24 episodes of The Men From Shiloh are seperated in syndication from the rest of The Virginian, which is a mistake. Because season 9 of The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh, was not optioned by Encore for broadcast, it has not been restored or remastered, as the package wrongly indicates, and is bleached out, like many Universal shows of the past 50 years (excepting color Wagon Trains and Laredo, which though unrestored seem marvelously intact). Sound quality is also unrestored and sometimes comes across muffled and harsh; in some later shows sound/picture are out of synchronization.

Despite all these complaints, it was worthwhile buying this season set, if just to see how The Virginian (1962-1971) ended it's 9 season run in one timeslot on NBC. Including a 1958 black and white half-hour pilot I saw on-line, The Virginian had 250 episodes in total. I hope Timeless will release a complete series box set including the pilot and a (this time) remastered The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh.",1325116800,19,1868,5.101307189542483
