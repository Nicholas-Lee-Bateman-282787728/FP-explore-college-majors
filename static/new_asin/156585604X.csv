It was clear this was probably his first video recorded presentation for Great Courses and it took him the first couple of lectures to relax and get used to shifting his eyes to the correct video cameras during transitions; but, he is a very fast learner and once he settled down his talks were nicely organized and articulately presented. This course is very fairly priced and in my opinion worth every cent.",1492560000,,436,4.75
7796525,1,156585604X,"Unfortunately, the instructor violates his own academic methodology by rambling on about his personal opinions (not necessarily religious) rather than addressing the topic of the lecture.  As a result, the lectures become mostly baby boomer reminisces, frequently citing obscure TV commercials from that era.  If his stated objective was to teach students how to think clearly about the subject of religion, it fails miserably.",1492041600,,427,5.65625
7796526,1,156585604X,This is not a broad view. It is very Christian with no real awareness of Judaism.,1489536000,,81,4.125

7796528,5,156585604X,"Zarathustra doesn't get it. To discuss if one can know anything of a supreme being, the attributes of supremacy must be an agreed given. I have never enjoyed a course more.",1421539200,3,172,4.580645161290323
7796529,1,156585604X,"This is the most biased Great Course I have seen yet. He calls God the greatest being without even taking the time to investigate his or her existence. If you don't agree with him, he calls you a fool.",1386892800,3,201,4.17948717948718
