3075147,5,B00123PTNW,"Energetic Miley Cyrus is a dynamo in this bubbly concert film. The likable, ever-smiling 15-year-old positively shimmers with charm. Her sunny personality bubbles out both backstage and during performances.

The concert -- and the whole Hannah/Miley story -- is a celebration of girlhood, of sisterhood, of the power of positive thought. A girl can be whatever she wants to be. It's a powerful message.

This two-disc set has both 2-D and 3-D viewing options, a Dolby 5.1 track and both fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen formats. Bonus features include extra behind-the-scenes footage and a sing-along mode.

As for the movie itself, it begins backstage before the concert, and then you see Hannah sing ""Rock Star."" What hits you right away is the joy from the girls in the audience. They are thrilled to be there, singing along, screaming and waving their arms. The electricity from the crowd is matched onstage. No one seems happier or more excited to be there than Hannah/Miley herself.

Disney heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers come onstage to sing with the star, and by themselves. While they are performing, Hannah goes backstage and switches to Miley (i.e., she takes off the blonde wig). Miley's songs are a little edgier, slightly sexier, as she sings the sisterhood anthem ""Girl's Night Out,"" and the flamenco-inspired ""Let's Dance."" She sits down to sing and play guitar to ""I Miss You,"" a tribute to her late grandfather.

Interspersed are rehearsal segments, Miley and her dad traveling together to the studio and later singing a duet at home, Miley's mom describing how she helps her daughter change clothes backstage, and fans and their dads saying why they like Hannah/Miley -- often wearing long blonde wigs. A funny contest shows dedicated dads duct-taping high heels to their big feet to enter a race to win tickets to the concert for their daughters.

The 3D effects are mild, mostly serving to make you feel more immersed in the concert. There are a few obvious 3D moments -- a flicked guitar pick, a jabbed microphone stand, drum sticks flying through the air -- but mostly the depth comes from objects and people receding away from you, leaving Miley up close and personal.

As a parent watching this young open-faced girl, I remembered seeing Britney Spears perform at the peak of her stardom. Both had a crowd of screaming, adoring preteen girls. Both were pretty and stylish. Miley has the benefit of engaged parents, plus the protective power of Disney. Here's hoping she is spared Britney's sad and ugly road.",1207785600,5,2537,4.983451536643026
3075148,5,B00123PTNW,"My name is Brittany (zach's sister) I'm 16 and I loved this movie.  It was so good and I couldn't get a smile off my face.  This movie is perfect for any girl who loves Hannah/Miley but couldn't snag tickets for the concert(like me) and for all the lucky ones who did, but want to relive the moment.  This movie makes you feel like you are there in the front and she is singing only to you.  It shows Hannah singing about 5 songs and then Miley sings about 5.  Also it has backstage extras throughout the film with 3 songs preformed by the Jonas Brothers(who are now on tour by themselves).  This is a great buy for any Hannah/Miley lover!!!",1207094400,7,641,4.256198347107438
3075149,5,B00123PTNW,"I'm one of the many who didn't get to see Miley's concert in person, so I jumped at the chance to get a ticket to the concert movie.  I thought $15 was a bit high for a movie, but it was better than paying over $100 for a ticket to the real concert.  Anyway, I really enjoyed seeing the movie, and the fact that it was 3-D was really cool, because it made it seem more like I was at a real concert.  It also had a few behind-the-scenes segments, which I thought was pretty cool.  I just wish it had been longer, because I love all of Miley's songs.  I hope they'll put out this movie on DVD, because it'd be fun to see it again.",1202601600,11,628,3.9133858267716537
3075150,4,B00123PTNW,I went to the Hannah Montana concert I was one of the lucky ones to see Hannah Montana in concert live I liked the movie but when I upset when I left the movie theatre because they didn't saw when the Jonas Brothers were on stage before Hannah Montana came on so didn't saw more of the Jonas Brothers and they didn't have all the songs that the Hannah Montana did like Pump up the party and also Old Blue Jeans and also If we were a movie but I am hoping that they saw them on the Bonus Features so I can all of the songs that she did so I can have memories when I saw Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus in concert,1202342400,3,610,3.888
3075151,5,B00123PTNW,"Energetic Miley Cyrus is a dynamo in this bubbly concert film, a celebration of girlhood, of sisterhood, of the power of positive thought. The likable, ever-smiling 15-year-old positively shimmers with charm. Her sunny personality takes over both backstage and during performances. Sure it's slick, and on the surface about as light as cotton candy. But its underlining, and everpresent, message -- that a girl can be whatever, and whoever, she wants -- is powerful, and I think important for young girls to hear as often as they can.

The 74-minute movie begins backstage, but before long the show begins as Hannah sings ""Rock Star."" What hits you right away is the joy from the girls in the audience -- both onscreen and, at least in my case, in the movie theater. They scream, wave their waves and sing along to every word. The electricity is matched onstage, as no one seems more excited to be there than Hannah/Miley herself.

Disney heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers (or, as the young girls around me referred to them, ""THE JONAS BROTHERS!!!!!!"") soon join Hannah onstage, and then perform by themselves. During this time we follow Hannah as she heads backstage, takes off her wig, and becomes Miley. When she returns, the songs are a little edgier and at times a little sexy. Miley works the stage like a pro during the sisterhood anthem ""Girl's Night Out"" and the flamenco-inspired ""Let's Dance,"" then sits down to sing, and play guitar to, ""I Miss You,"" a tribute to her late grandfather.

Interspersed with the show are rehearsal segments -- Miley and her dad traveling together to the studio and later singing a duet at home, Miley's mom describing how she helps her daughter change clothes backstage, and fans and their dads (often wearing long blonde wigs themselves) saying why they like Hannah/Miley. A funny contest segment shows dedicated dads duct-taping high heels to their big feet to enter a race to win tickets to the concert.

For the most part the 3D effects are mild, and simply serve to immerse you in the show. Though some things come at you (including a flicked guitar pick, a jabbed microphone stand and some flying drum sticks), the real illusion of depth comes from people and objects receding away from the screen, a technique which appears to bring Hannah/Miley slightly closer.

As a parent watching this young open-faced girl, I remembered seeing Britney Spears perform at the peak of her stardom. She also had a screaming, adoring crowd of preteen girls, and was equally pretty, stylish and talented. Miley, though, has more to work with. She has the benefit of engaged parents, as well as the protective power of Disney, the latter not just at the beginning of her career, but also as it explodes. Here's hoping they help spare her Britney's sad and ugly road.",1202083200,26,2794,4.849056603773585

3075246,3,B00123PTNW,"We were so excited to play this DVD, but when I started it I actually thought something was wrong with our home theater system. Turns out the audio recording is just plain awfull, probably would be fine if you still watch things on a box TV, but not if you have good speakers and a really good sound system. Very disappointing and annoying for me, but of course my six year old can't tell the difference at all, and I bought it for her. She loves it and dances in her costumes when she watches it.",1282089600,,497,4.1875
3075247,4,B00123PTNW,"With this set you get two dvds. One regular version and one 3D one. I bought this for my little cousin who is 4 and big fan.

The regular dvd, we put it on for my little cousin and she really liked it. She danced and sang along with it. The dvd keeps her entertained and she asks to watch it all the time. I think she would watch it everyday. It's what I would expect from a concert DVD.

The 3D one, I think a four year old is too young to understand this. The 3D glass are the red and blue ones. The don't stay on when she is dancing around or she pulls them off. Then when the glasses are off the image has the 3D blur. I think it would take a couple of years for her to understand and enjoy it.",1264204800,2,698,3.7739726027397262

I would say it's Miley at her best but I've been to two of her concerts on the Wonder World tour and she's definitely giving this concert a run for its money. However, I was SO SO SO dissapointed at the 3D graphics. Nothing appeared to be 3D and trust me I spent an hour trying to convince myself that I was seeing something in 3D. It all appeared blurry even with the glasses on! The one I purchased was the regular DVD not Blu-Ray and I read a review on here that says the Blu-Ray one was excellent. I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I'm tempted to go buy one so that I can experience this concert in true 3D fashion.

3075251,1,B00123PTNW,"Here we have a great example of highly polished, easily packaged, pre-teen manufactured musical product. ""Hey kids, wanna be cool but keep Mommy and Daddy happy? Buy this!"" - But there is more to this McMusic than just pedestrian synthetic pop.

  The marketers of this product have managed to sell sex to pre-teens, along with the shoes, toys, clothes and CDs. Using a light touch, skimming the surface of seduction, the music and personas of these ""pop stars"" have been carefully crafted to stir pre-teens into a frenzy. The innuendos in the lyrics combined with the costumes and the stage acts activate deeply buried pre-teen emotions that translate into a fervor of consumerism. ""Buy-buy-buy"", their little minds scream this message, while their parents think ""Its so wholesome and sweet"" - nothing could be further from the truth.

  Real music stirs the soul and elevates the mind into a higher state. The  dervative, artificial sounds and platic visuals of Hannah Montana and the Jonas Bros. do the opposite; turning the pre-teens into purchasing units in a mass marketing grid. This ""music"" is not just bad, its a corrosive substance that will burn away the souls of your kids and turn them into mindless sheep.

 Resist purchasing this emotionless dreck.",1249344000,6,1263,5.033653846153846

3075257,3,B00123PTNW,"When I was asked to review the Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus Best of Both Worlds Concert film I really didn't know what to expect. I thought that this would be a show that only young children who had hopped onto the Hannah Montana marketing train would enjoy. I was wrong. This is a slickly produced concert film that has enough going for it that most adults will also enjoy it. Its not the Rolling Stones but it can be quite entertaining.

Starting with some backstage footage and going through the rehearsal period the film moves into concert footage shot at four shows during the sold out world tour. There are also some interview moments with Cyrus and her father and some backstage segments as the show goes on.

The Blu Ray disc presents a perfect picture with sound that it quite good. If there is a misstep here its that Disney has failed to include very much bonus material. There are two extra songs, a sing along mode and some more backstage footage.

This one is quite good even for an oldster like me.",1237680000,,1015,4.475675675675675
3075258,5,B00123PTNW,I really didn't want to watch this since I think Billy Ray is really pimping out his daughter but lately got custody of the daughter I never knew I had and she had to have this. I have to give a nod to Disney. Great use of Anaglyph 3d. Anaglyph was never meant for out of screen effects and this DVD shows it. Terrific 3D as it shows the venue and crowd at a great distance and doesn't try to hard to impress. Not impressed with the girl since she can't sing but am impressed with the 3D. Good job Disney. Hope they release more 3D movies like this.,1236470400,,549,4.045871559633028
3075259,4,B00123PTNW,I bought this Concert in the hope that the 3D would be so much better than the DVD version. After viewing the DVD version it was your usual ok Red & blue 3D but the blu-Ray 3D version is fantastic the depth of the picture is sensational and even the 3D gimmicks like when Miley Cyrus puts the microphone at your face is much better than I have ever seen in home versions of 3D before. I was not really into Miley's Hannah Montana music set but I really enjoyed her set as herself with songs such as See you again & I miss you which is just a fantastic song. It's nice to see a young girl sing a song like that with such passion but I guess with a great singing father like Billy Ray Cyrus the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. So to sum up my review I have given the 3D 5 Stars and for the Concert itself I have given the Hannah Montana set 3 Stars and the Miley Cyrus set 5 stars and an overall rating of 4 Stars.,1233446400,,922,3.9095744680851063

Miley's even telling us the meaning of one of her songs, dedicated to her late grandfather.

The overall impression is of a well-balanced, loved by her daddy good girl who is not likely to turn bad or weird, the way some other teen idols did as they aged.

As for the 3-D experience, it's the old red-blue technology. You don't need any special hardware other than the cardboard 3-D glasses but you lose a most of the colors, sacrificing colors for depth. On a hi-res TV it's a pretty good experience.

I can't understand what all the hype about Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus is about.

My kids get headaches watching the 3D version on TV, but are just as excited watching it with it off. If your kids have any affection for Hannah Montana they will love this. As much as I hate to promote the commercialism of Hannah Montana, the reality is there are many negative influences out there in the entertainment world and Hannah is good, clean entertainment.

3075317,5,B00123PTNW,"Imagine pre-teen fans shrieking at a concert making a sound that one parent concert goer described as ""Getting behind a jet.""

And is all the fuss worth it?

I'd like to say a hearty, 'Yes'.  Hannah Montana has such natural exuberance and charm to go with her positive power pop voice, she's an all-around entertainer.  Sporting the moves of a cheerleader, her happy-go-lucky spirit is energetic, but never seems forced.

Backed up by synchronized dancers, kaleidoscopic colors and costumes, and a spunky back up band, and you have a venue that draws on Broadway, but touches the ground again when it needs to be a rock concert.

Surely she's inherited talent from dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, who offers, ""She writes what she lives...It's real.""  Miley's own explanation of songwriting taps into what even geniuses draw from, lyrics that mean one story to the writer, but is laid down with a broad enough brush to touch millions of lives in each of their stories.

'Hannah Montana:  Best of Both Worlds' is an infectious G-rated venue.  It's simple in many ways and not all flashy, yet the camera goes exactly where it should.  Director Bruce Hendrick and editor Michael Tronick are steady enough to take us in all the right directions.  We see choreographed rehearsals, one on-stage flub gets corrected, and a perfect series of preconcert fan outtakes of kiddie enthusiasm and even a hilarious (if not dangerous) race for fathers to win tickets for their families.

With music that is propulsive like the Go-Gos and an entertainer with such a good disposition, how can anyone resist?  (If you doubt Hannah Montana's (Miley Cyrus's) draw, then you've missed out on the biggest merchandise extravaganza for pre-teen kids in memory.)

3075319,4,B00123PTNW,"Those of us who grew up with phenomenon of The Monkees can smile with recognition at the Tiger Beat-fueled frenzy surrounding today tween sensations. Not long ago it was Lizzie McGuire. Now a young girl barely knows who that is. Most recently it's been the powerhouse that is Hannah Montana, a franchise very much like The Monkees in that the records and the TV series nurture each other.

Miley Cyrus is remarkably talented and self-assured in her performances. Despite some bumps in the road in the last year, we can only hope she can weather the challenges ahead. She's maturing as a ""product"" and is approaching a crossroads. According to my daughter and her tween crowd, she's being eclipsed by the Jonas Brothers (or just ""Jonas Brothers"" as they are insistently called in official and scripted material).

These two DVD packages capture both entities at two very different career points. Miley ""Hannah"" period seems to have reached its fever pitch with the theatrical 3-D Best of Both Worlds Concert. Tickets sold out and histrionics ensued, both around her live concert tour and the movie. The whole thing was brilliantly orchestrated from a marketing point of view.

The second DVD disc in the ""2-Disc Extended Edition"" package contains the 3-D version of the movie. Four sets of 3-D glasses are included along with a way to order more if necessary (I usually keep all my various 3-D glasses for handy re-use). The effect on TV is not nearly as impressive as in the film because the polarization technique cannot be done on TV, as far as I know, so this uses the old red-and-blue lens trick. It's still fun.

The first disc has the concert film in 2-D and some extra features like a sing-along, extra Jonas songs and a nice little ""Ultimate Personal Tour"" similar to the backstage footage in the film, and perhaps culled from the same footage. It's interesting to see Miley talk about shoes and shopping like a typical teen rather than a corporate entity.",1219795200,3,1964,4.8017751479289945

Like most concert tours, it shows the behind the scenes look at the concert. Some very cute for the Disney Tweens who love the Montana show. Some of the behind the scenes look like childish pranks, but then I remember Miley is only fifteen herself.

The concert is entertaining and lively. The Jonas Brothers on the bill, this concert film cant miss

However, the intercutting between the concert and the rehearsal/behind the scenes gets on my nerves. I would rather the full concert, without the behind the scenes footage.

I can not wait until November when Disney releases The whole first season of Hannah Montana. I know my niece Julia will love it for Christmas (like she loves this DVD) and I will again her a GREAT uncle in her eyes for a few more minutes

""Right Here,"" ""SOS,"" ""Good & Broken,"" & ""Pumpin' Up The Party,"" were on the disc w/ the middle 2 songs included as bonuses while the 1st & last song were edited back into the concert itself.

3075335,3,B00123PTNW,"I saw this in theaters and it was quite entertaining. I have a few complaints though...My first one is that it was much too short, there was no need to edit out any songs, although it seems like they added them back as bonus features on this DVD.

My second, and biggest complaint is the Jonas brothers....they are awful, totally talentless hacks that have no place in the music industry, needless to say at these concerts and this DVD. They're segment of the concert is brief, but still entirely too long. A collaboration with Miley was all that would be needed, since they wrote one of her songs. There are hundreds of better ways to buy time for Miley than to have the Jonas brothers perform. But once you get past the nasal section (Jonas brothers) of the show, it goes smoothly.

My third complaint, about the DVD version specifically, is the 3-D effect seems to have been downgraded. I believe they have gone from the outstanding new technology implemented in theaters to the very old and crappy red and blue glasses. This negates all of the awesome visuals in the concert, and makes the entire experience far less enjoyable. I was fully expecting to buy this DVD, but I am not so sure I want to spend $25 for a crappy 3-D version.  Why can't they just use the same 3-D technology they used in theaters? There MUST be better ways to have the same effects in your house without resorting to the old red and blue.  I still don't quite understand what they need 2 discs for. The concert is just over an hour long, and the features are probably about 30 minutes. Unless they are also including a non 3-D version of the concert on the second disc, which would make it more desirable.",1218326400,,1684,4.47557003257329

3075339,5,B00123PTNW,"As a 16 year old male, I recieved far more than several strange looks upon entering the theatre to see this movie. There was one girl in particular who sat in front of me and managed to turn around and look at me with a rather pathetic lack of comprehension somewhere between 10 to 20 times before the movie started. I could just see in her eyes that she, like many of the other close-minded immature tweens whom surrounded me, was thoroughly considering either my sanity or my sexual orientation. It really is incredibly unsettling that our society is as bigoted and incapable as it is. Target demographic, shmarget demographic; Miley/Hannah's music is incredibly entertaining, well composed, and, at times, moving, regardless of age or gender.

BUT anyway, on with the review...

Miley's voice is amazing. It's even better live than on her CD's, and this film presents absolutely no exception. Her control and range are darn impressive, while at the same time her voice maintains an innocence and untapped potential that makes it satisfyingly difficult to stop listenting to her. I have to say that I love the unique controlled vocal crack that seems to be her signature during extended segments of vocal influctuation. She's also absolutely fearless; how many 15 year olds could keep their composure in front of 15,000+ people nearly every night with the comfort and facility that she does?
And on top off all her talent, she is, to put it incredibly frankly, pretty darn hott.

The instrumentation throughout the concert was superb. Her lead guitarist and drummer especially were outstanding in my opinion. One thing that I love about concert experiences is that the music itself is always far better than it is on the recording, since record companies and such can't put restrictions on spantaneous improvisations by the musicians. It was also a treat to listen to Miley play an acoustic guitar during ""I Miss You.""

Perhaps the best part of the film was the 3D effect. The glasses, thank God, weren't the blue and red sort that leave your color perception ruined and your head aching for hours, but were much better quality plastic ones.
I happen to be an aspiring filmmaker, so coming from a cinematographic point of view, this movie left nothing to be desired. Sweeping camera shots, pleasantly unexpected close ups, and creatively fun visual tricks in post production made the absolute best use of the 3D effect possible. At one point during viewing, I almost subconsciously convinced myself that I actually WAS right there, front row at her performance. You literally feel like you could reach out and touch her at any time.
The vibrant use/balance of color was in no way distorted by the glasses [if anything, the 3D effect enhanced them] and the very well designed stage setup and enormous venue could've made even the smallest theatre seem wonderfully spacious.

One of my personal favorite moments of the experience was the period of time in which the incomparable Jonas Brothers played a few songs while Miley changed. Their dramatic music, rich instrumentation, and dependably deep and passionate performances/vocals alone were worth the $15, and one can only hope that they will release a filmed concert as well... Haha, but I digress.

My only complaint would have to be that the entire concert is not included. There were numerous songs that I was looking forward to, but that didn't make it past the cutting room floor. I suppose they had to pick and choose between performances though since they had to fit behind-the-scenes action as well.

All in all, this movie is incontrovertably entertaining and simply bursting with refreshing talent. People can tell me I'm ""not supposed"" to enjoy what Miley has to offer all they want, but the fact of the matter is that she is a quality entertainer and to refuse fandom based merely on social expectation is ridiculous and pathetic. I cannot wait until this DVD comes out, and you can bet that it'll be in my DVD player before the day it becomes available is through.",1208304000,65,4031,4.89311859443631
3075340,5,B00123PTNW,"I am really glad this movie is coming to DVD!  I thought it was or is one of the best movies.  It was brilliantly filmed with absolutely great sound mixing, film editing and super color. I thought it was cool that everything from the 3-D Cameras to the elevator operators got in on the act.  The technical background shots were fascinating.  The buildup footage to the actual concert of Miley, Hannah and her family were a definite plus and when Hannah came on, the whole thing took off like a rocket.  She was mixed perfectly with her band and visually with her dancers and band as was Miley. The audience noise was mixed in perfectly also.  If you were at the actual concert down front, you could not hear the music for the crowd noise.  Hannah is definitely ""America's Rock Star!"" and Destiny Hope's dream.  What a wonderful combination in one concert and movie.

After having received the 3D DVD, I am disappointed because it is not a quality job.  THe container also contains a 2D DVD and that is very good.  To watch the 3D DVD, the viewer is provided with those little cardboard red and green glasses and they are about useless if you wear glasses.  I quite liked the actual movie in theaters in 3D, but they gave out quality lenses that do not work with the DVD.  Disney did such a great job on the movie, why couldn't they at least approximate that feat on the DVD?",1208217600,2,1374,4.426294820717131
3309644,5,B00123PTNW,"Energetic Miley Cyrus is a dynamo in this bubbly concert film. The likable, ever-smiling 15-year-old positively shimmers with charm. Her sunny personality bubbles out both backstage and during performances.

The concert -- and the whole Hannah/Miley story -- is a celebration of girlhood, of sisterhood, of the power of positive thought. A girl can be whatever she wants to be. It's a powerful message.

This two-disc set has both 2-D and 3-D viewing options, a Dolby 5.1 track and both fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen formats. Bonus features include extra behind-the-scenes footage and a sing-along mode.

As for the movie itself, it begins backstage before the concert, and then you see Hannah sing ""Rock Star."" What hits you right away is the joy from the girls in the audience. They are thrilled to be there, singing along, screaming and waving their arms. The electricity from the crowd is matched onstage. No one seems happier or more excited to be there than Hannah/Miley herself.

Disney heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers come onstage to sing with the star, and by themselves. While they are performing, Hannah goes backstage and switches to Miley (i.e., she takes off the blonde wig). Miley's songs are a little edgier, slightly sexier, as she sings the sisterhood anthem ""Girl's Night Out,"" and the flamenco-inspired ""Let's Dance."" She sits down to sing and play guitar to ""I Miss You,"" a tribute to her late grandfather.

Interspersed are rehearsal segments, Miley and her dad traveling together to the studio and later singing a duet at home, Miley's mom describing how she helps her daughter change clothes backstage, and fans and their dads saying why they like Hannah/Miley -- often wearing long blonde wigs. A funny contest shows dedicated dads duct-taping high heels to their big feet to enter a race to win tickets to the concert for their daughters.

The 3D effects are mild, mostly serving to make you feel more immersed in the concert. There are a few obvious 3D moments -- a flicked guitar pick, a jabbed microphone stand, drum sticks flying through the air -- but mostly the depth comes from objects and people receding away from you, leaving Miley up close and personal.

As a parent watching this young open-faced girl, I remembered seeing Britney Spears perform at the peak of her stardom. Both had a crowd of screaming, adoring preteen girls. Both were pretty and stylish. Miley has the benefit of engaged parents, plus the protective power of Disney. Here's hoping she is spared Britney's sad and ugly road.",1207785600,5,2537,4.983451536643026

This movie makes you feel like you are there in the front and she is singing only to you.  It shows Hannah singing about 5 songs and then Miley sings about 5.

Sure it's slick, and on the surface about as light as cotton candy. But its underlining, and everpresent, message -- that a girl can be whatever, and whoever, she wants -- is powerful, and I think important for young girls to hear as often as they can.

The 74-minute movie begins backstage, but before long the show begins as Hannah sings ""Rock Star."" What hits you right away is the joy from the girls in the audience -- both onscreen and, at least in my case, in the movie theater. They scream, wave their waves and sing along to every word. The electricity is matched onstage, as no one seems more excited to be there than Hannah/Miley herself.

Disney heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers (or, as the young girls around me referred to them, ""THE JONAS BROTHERS!!!!!!"") soon join Hannah onstage, and then perform by themselves. During this time we follow Hannah as she heads backstage, takes off her wig, and becomes Miley. When she returns, the songs are a little edgier and at times a little sexy. Miley works the stage like a pro during the sisterhood anthem ""Girl's Night Out"" and the flamenco-inspired ""Let's Dance,"" then sits down to sing, and play guitar to, ""I Miss You,"" a tribute to her late grandfather.

The regular dvd, we put it on for my little cousin and she really liked it. She danced and sang along with it. The dvd keeps her entertained and she asks to watch it all the time. I think she would watch it everyday. It's what I would expect from a concert DVD.

The 3D one, I think a four year old is too young to understand this. The 3D glass are the red and blue ones. The don't stay on when she is dancing around or she pulls them off. Then when the glasses are off the image has the 3D blur. I think it would take a couple of years for her to understand and enjoy it.",1264204800,2,698,3.7739726027397262

It all appeared blurry even with the glasses on! The one I purchased was the regular DVD not Blu-Ray and I read a review on here that says the Blu-Ray one was excellent. I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I'm tempted to go buy one so that I can experience this concert in true 3D fashion.

  The marketers of this product have managed to sell sex to pre-teens, along with the shoes, toys, clothes and CDs. Using a light touch, skimming the surface of seduction, the music and personas of these ""pop stars"" have been carefully crafted to stir pre-teens into a frenzy. The innuendos in the lyrics combined with the costumes and the stage acts activate deeply buried pre-teen emotions that translate into a fervor of consumerism. ""Buy-buy-buy"", their little minds scream this message, while their parents think ""Its so wholesome and sweet"" - nothing could be further from the truth.

  Real music stirs the soul and elevates the mind into a higher state. The  dervative, artificial sounds and platic visuals of Hannah Montana and the Jonas Bros. do the opposite; turning the pre-teens into purchasing units in a mass marketing grid. This ""music"" is not just bad, its a corrosive substance that will burn away the souls of your kids and turn them into mindless sheep.

3309754,3,B00123PTNW,"When I was asked to review the Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus Best of Both Worlds Concert film I really didn't know what to expect. I thought that this would be a show that only young children who had hopped onto the Hannah Montana marketing train would enjoy. I was wrong. This is a slickly produced concert film that has enough going for it that most adults will also enjoy it. Its not the Rolling Stones but it can be quite entertaining.

Starting with some backstage footage and going through the rehearsal period the film moves into concert footage shot at four shows during the sold out world tour. There are also some interview moments with Cyrus and her father and some backstage segments as the show goes on.

The Blu Ray disc presents a perfect picture with sound that it quite good. If there is a misstep here its that Disney has failed to include very much bonus material. There are two extra songs, a sing along mode and some more backstage footage.

This one is quite good even for an oldster like me.",1237680000,,1015,4.475675675675675

I have to give a nod to Disney. Great use of Anaglyph 3d. Anaglyph was never meant for out of screen effects and this DVD shows it. Terrific 3D as it shows the venue and crowd at a great distance and doesn't try to hard to impress. Not impressed with the girl since she can't sing but am impressed with the 3D. Good job Disney.

After viewing the DVD version it was your usual ok Red & blue 3D but the blu-Ray 3D version is fantastic the depth of the picture is sensational and even the 3D gimmicks like when Miley Cyrus puts the microphone at your face is much better than I have ever seen in home versions of 3D before. I was not really into Miley's Hannah Montana music set but I really enjoyed her set as herself with songs such as See you again & I miss you which is just a fantastic song. It's nice to see a young girl sing a song like that with such passion but I guess with a great singing father like Billy Ray Cyrus the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. So to sum up my review I have given the 3D 5 Stars and for the Concert itself I have given the Hannah Montana set 3 Stars and the Miley Cyrus set 5 stars and an overall rating of 4 Stars.,1233446400,,922,3.9095744680851063

Miley's even telling us the meaning of one of her songs, dedicated to her late grandfather.

The overall impression is of a well-balanced, loved by her daddy good girl who is not likely to turn bad or weird, the way some other teen idols did as they aged.

As for the 3-D experience, it's the old red-blue technology. You don't need any special hardware other than the cardboard 3-D glasses but you lose a most of the colors, sacrificing colors for depth. On a hi-res TV it's a pretty good experience.

3309814,5,B00123PTNW,"Imagine pre-teen fans shrieking at a concert making a sound that one parent concert goer described as ""Getting behind a jet.""

And is all the fuss worth it?

I'd like to say a hearty, 'Yes'.  Hannah Montana has such natural exuberance and charm to go with her positive power pop voice, she's an all-around entertainer.  Sporting the moves of a cheerleader, her happy-go-lucky spirit is energetic, but never seems forced.

Backed up by synchronized dancers, kaleidoscopic colors and costumes, and a spunky back up band, and you have a venue that draws on Broadway, but touches the ground again when it needs to be a rock concert.

Surely she's inherited talent from dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, who offers, ""She writes what she lives...It's real.""  Miley's own explanation of songwriting taps into what even geniuses draw from, lyrics that mean one story to the writer, but is laid down with a broad enough brush to touch millions of lives in each of their stories.

'Hannah Montana:  Best of Both Worlds' is an infectious G-rated venue.  It's simple in many ways and not all flashy, yet the camera goes exactly where it should.  Director Bruce Hendrick and editor Michael Tronick are steady enough to take us in all the right directions.  We see choreographed rehearsals, one on-stage flub gets corrected, and a perfect series of preconcert fan outtakes of kiddie enthusiasm and even a hilarious (if not dangerous) race for fathers to win tickets for their families.

With music that is propulsive like the Go-Gos and an entertainer with such a good disposition, how can anyone resist?  (If you doubt Hannah Montana's (Miley Cyrus's) draw, then you've missed out on the biggest merchandise extravaganza for pre-teen kids in memory.)

3309816,4,B00123PTNW,"Those of us who grew up with phenomenon of The Monkees can smile with recognition at the Tiger Beat-fueled frenzy surrounding today tween sensations. Not long ago it was Lizzie McGuire. Now a young girl barely knows who that is. Most recently it's been the powerhouse that is Hannah Montana, a franchise very much like The Monkees in that the records and the TV series nurture each other.

Miley Cyrus is remarkably talented and self-assured in her performances. Despite some bumps in the road in the last year, we can only hope she can weather the challenges ahead. She's maturing as a ""product"" and is approaching a crossroads. According to my daughter and her tween crowd, she's being eclipsed by the Jonas Brothers (or just ""Jonas Brothers"" as they are insistently called in official and scripted material).

These two DVD packages capture both entities at two very different career points. Miley ""Hannah"" period seems to have reached its fever pitch with the theatrical 3-D Best of Both Worlds Concert. Tickets sold out and histrionics ensued, both around her live concert tour and the movie. The whole thing was brilliantly orchestrated from a marketing point of view.

The second DVD disc in the ""2-Disc Extended Edition"" package contains the 3-D version of the movie. Four sets of 3-D glasses are included along with a way to order more if necessary (I usually keep all my various 3-D glasses for handy re-use). The effect on TV is not nearly as impressive as in the film because the polarization technique cannot be done on TV, as far as I know, so this uses the old red-and-blue lens trick. It's still fun.

The first disc has the concert film in 2-D and some extra features like a sing-along, extra Jonas songs and a nice little ""Ultimate Personal Tour"" similar to the backstage footage in the film, and perhaps culled from the same footage. It's interesting to see Miley talk about shoes and shopping like a typical teen rather than a corporate entity.",1219795200,3,1964,4.8017751479289945

Like most concert tours, it shows the behind the scenes look at the concert. Some very cute for the Disney Tweens who love the Montana show. Some of the behind the scenes look like childish pranks, but then I remember Miley is only fifteen herself.

The concert is entertaining and lively. The Jonas Brothers on the bill, this concert film cant miss

However, the intercutting between the concert and the rehearsal/behind the scenes gets on my nerves. I would rather the full concert, without the behind the scenes footage.

I can not wait until November when Disney releases The whole first season of Hannah Montana. I know my niece Julia will love it for Christmas (like she loves this DVD) and I will again her a GREAT uncle in her eyes for a few more minutes

3309829,2,B00123PTNW,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be great to watch because Miley Cyrus is a great singer and performer, but when I opened it to watch the 3D version there was nothing 3D about it. It came with four red and blue 3D glasses . It made me feel nauseated (well, not really) but I could not watch anymore of the 3D version. You can even watch it without the glasses because it looks like the 2D version except with a little blur. It is horrible like watching VHS version. It was a disappointment. I might return it if i can. I wonder if other 3D glasses will work. For me, I don't like concert versions of songs.",1219276800,6,609,4.126050420168068
3309830,2,B00123PTNW,"I bought it for my young daughter and we sat down to watch it only to learn that the whole time Miley was singing on stage, it was not closed captioned so I had no idea what she was singing about. The only time it was closed captioned was when she was rehearsing for the show or talking between songs.  This isn't right and I expected the entire songs to be closed captioned.  Also wearing the 3-D glasses really started to hurt my eyes as they were of poor quality so I had to take it off.  I am not pleased with the whole thing.",1219190400,4,530,4.0285714285714285

I am a little peeved to see that 4 out of the 6 deleted songs were included on the dvd, but the one that I would have really liked to see, ""East Northumberland High,"" was not included in any of the special features. ""Right Here,"" ""SOS,"" ""Good & Broken,"" & ""Pumpin' Up The Party,"" were on the disc w/ the middle 2 songs included as bonuses while the 1st & last song were edited back into the concert itself. I have tried looking to see if the songs were easter eggs, but no such luck. The DVD itself is great w/ its typical Disney DVD features, but I would have liked to see ""East Northumberland High,"" in the concert. Oh well, can't win them all.",1219017600,,752,4.087837837837838
3309832,3,B00123PTNW,"I saw this in theaters and it was quite entertaining. I have a few complaints though...My first one is that it was much too short, there was no need to edit out any songs, although it seems like they added them back as bonus features on this DVD.

My second, and biggest complaint is the Jonas brothers....they are awful, totally talentless hacks that have no place in the music industry, needless to say at these concerts and this DVD. They're segment of the concert is brief, but still entirely too long. A collaboration with Miley was all that would be needed, since they wrote one of her songs. There are hundreds of better ways to buy time for Miley than to have the Jonas brothers perform. But once you get past the nasal section (Jonas brothers) of the show, it goes smoothly.

My third complaint, about the DVD version specifically, is the 3-D effect seems to have been downgraded. I believe they have gone from the outstanding new technology implemented in theaters to the very old and crappy red and blue glasses. This negates all of the awesome visuals in the concert, and makes the entire experience far less enjoyable. I was fully expecting to buy this DVD, but I am not so sure I want to spend $25 for a crappy 3-D version.  Why can't they just use the same 3-D technology they used in theaters? There MUST be better ways to have the same effects in your house without resorting to the old red and blue.  I still don't quite understand what they need 2 discs for. The concert is just over an hour long, and the features are probably about 30 minutes. Unless they are also including a non 3-D version of the concert on the second disc, which would make it more desirable.",1218326400,,1684,4.47557003257329
3309833,2,B00123PTNW,"this was cool in the theater, becuase it was realistic and looked nice, in this version the only 2 colors you can see are shades of blue and red and it makes it like a whole different video, it was a movie I remembered as the best 3D movie I had ever seen, and on this version, it is just like anything else, its not worth the money to get this DVD, just wait til someone uploads it on thepiratebay or demonoid and get it free.",1217116800,,427,3.9767441860465116

My cousins said it felt like you were really there, but it just felt like I was watching regular TV. Don't buy it, its a waste of money.",1217030400,,538,3.8125

3309836,5,B00123PTNW,"As a 16 year old male, I recieved far more than several strange looks upon entering the theatre to see this movie. There was one girl in particular who sat in front of me and managed to turn around and look at me with a rather pathetic lack of comprehension somewhere between 10 to 20 times before the movie started. I could just see in her eyes that she, like many of the other close-minded immature tweens whom surrounded me, was thoroughly considering either my sanity or my sexual orientation. It really is incredibly unsettling that our society is as bigoted and incapable as it is. Target demographic, shmarget demographic; Miley/Hannah's music is incredibly entertaining, well composed, and, at times, moving, regardless of age or gender.

BUT anyway, on with the review...

Miley's voice is amazing. It's even better live than on her CD's, and this film presents absolutely no exception. Her control and range are darn impressive, while at the same time her voice maintains an innocence and untapped potential that makes it satisfyingly difficult to stop listenting to her. I have to say that I love the unique controlled vocal crack that seems to be her signature during extended segments of vocal influctuation. She's also absolutely fearless; how many 15 year olds could keep their composure in front of 15,000+ people nearly every night with the comfort and facility that she does?
And on top off all her talent, she is, to put it incredibly frankly, pretty darn hott.

The instrumentation throughout the concert was superb. Her lead guitarist and drummer especially were outstanding in my opinion. One thing that I love about concert experiences is that the music itself is always far better than it is on the recording, since record companies and such can't put restrictions on spantaneous improvisations by the musicians. It was also a treat to listen to Miley play an acoustic guitar during ""I Miss You.""

Perhaps the best part of the film was the 3D effect. The glasses, thank God, weren't the blue and red sort that leave your color perception ruined and your head aching for hours, but were much better quality plastic ones.
I happen to be an aspiring filmmaker, so coming from a cinematographic point of view, this movie left nothing to be desired. Sweeping camera shots, pleasantly unexpected close ups, and creatively fun visual tricks in post production made the absolute best use of the 3D effect possible. At one point during viewing, I almost subconsciously convinced myself that I actually WAS right there, front row at her performance. You literally feel like you could reach out and touch her at any time.
The vibrant use/balance of color was in no way distorted by the glasses [if anything, the 3D effect enhanced them] and the very well designed stage setup and enormous venue could've made even the smallest theatre seem wonderfully spacious.

One of my personal favorite moments of the experience was the period of time in which the incomparable Jonas Brothers played a few songs while Miley changed. Their dramatic music, rich instrumentation, and dependably deep and passionate performances/vocals alone were worth the $15, and one can only hope that they will release a filmed concert as well... Haha, but I digress.

My only complaint would have to be that the entire concert is not included. There were numerous songs that I was looking forward to, but that didn't make it past the cutting room floor. I suppose they had to pick and choose between performances though since they had to fit behind-the-scenes action as well.

All in all, this movie is incontrovertably entertaining and simply bursting with refreshing talent. People can tell me I'm ""not supposed"" to enjoy what Miley has to offer all they want, but the fact of the matter is that she is a quality entertainer and to refuse fandom based merely on social expectation is ridiculous and pathetic. I cannot wait until this DVD comes out, and you can bet that it'll be in my DVD player before the day it becomes available is through.",1208304000,65,4031,4.89311859443631
3309837,5,B00123PTNW,"I am really glad this movie is coming to DVD!  I thought it was or is one of the best movies.  It was brilliantly filmed with absolutely great sound mixing, film editing and super color. I thought it was cool that everything from the 3-D Cameras to the elevator operators got in on the act.  The technical background shots were fascinating.  The buildup footage to the actual concert of Miley, Hannah and her family were a definite plus and when Hannah came on, the whole thing took off like a rocket.  She was mixed perfectly with her band and visually with her dancers and band as was Miley. The audience noise was mixed in perfectly also.  If you were at the actual concert down front, you could not hear the music for the crowd noise.  Hannah is definitely ""America's Rock Star!"" and Destiny Hope's dream.  What a wonderful combination in one concert and movie.

After having received the 3D DVD, I am disappointed because it is not a quality job.  THe container also contains a 2D DVD and that is very good.  To watch the 3D DVD, the viewer is provided with those little cardboard red and green glasses and they are about useless if you wear glasses.  I quite liked the actual movie in theaters in 3D, but they gave out quality lenses that do not work with the DVD.  Disney did such a great job on the movie, why couldn't they at least approximate that feat on the DVD?",1208217600,2,1374,4.426294820717131
