1878494,4,B000094FFC,"""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is a documentary about four southern comedians who put on a one night show in Phoenix to finish off their four year tour.  I must say, I did not have extremely high expectations of the film.  I was moderately familiar with Foxworthy's stuff, but did not know much about the other three comedians.  I was pleasantly suprised by this film, and found it to be, for the most part, side-splittingly funny.
The film stars off with Ron White, who has a cigarette in one hand, and a drink in the other.  White scores big with some jokes on tubing, and the plane he took on the way to the show.
What's intresting about the film is that between acts, it shows the guys earlier when they went to a mall.  They go into stores, such as Victoria's Secret, Spencer's Gifts, and a few others.  This footage is humorous, yet it seems to be staged.  For instance, the Victoria's Secret woman looks as if she know's what's goin on, and plays along without ever a second thought.
Next, is Larry the Cable Guy, my personal favorite.  There is something about his accent and the way he tells his jokes that are just hard not to laugh at.
Then, Bill Engvall comes on stage.  I found him funny, however not as much so as the other three.  He mostly tried to get laughs telling stories about his 16 year old daughter, and I found that to be sort of boring for a little bit.  However, he did pick up the pace towards the end of his act.
Then comes the main event, Jeff Foxworthy.  He is most famous for his ""You might be a redneck"" jokes.  Foxworthy delivers, with jokes about airport security, and an out-of-body experience for a fish.
Then at the end, all four come on stage, and tell stories and some more jokes to finish off the show.
""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is a must-see for comedy fans, or just anyone in the mood for a good time.",1056153600,,1839,4.326530612244898

My wife and I sat down and wathced the three dvds end to end and enjoyed them immensely. Quite often the American comedians that we see craft their jokes around american happenings which don't always resonate with audiences outside of America and I suspect that American's would find humour from some other countries just as baffling. But, these guys pitch their humour and everyday events etc that you just can't help but laugh at. I am now trying to track down other dvds for these guys.",1349740800,,669,4.583333333333333

1878834,4,B000094FFC,"I resisted watching these Blue Collar comedy videos for a long time on the basis of the title alone. (I'm a Nichols & May, Monty Python, MST3K kinda guy.) But I always liked Bill Engvall back in the old ""Evening at the Improv"" shows (and snickered against my own judgment at Foxworthy's You-Might-Be-a-Redneck schtick), so took a flyer on 'em on cable... and damn, they are funny!!

I think, though, that a main element of the secret of their success is the ORDER of their act: Engvall, White, Foxworthy, Larry. They start with the most (relatively) intelligent of the four (Engvall)--and gradually ""devolve"" to Larry's Charlie-Weaver-redux grossout humor. Not to say they're not ALL hilarious, but it's like their whole act follows what must be the audience's growing level of inebriation.  Reverse the order, I don't think it would work nearly as well.

(By the way, Larry the Cable Guy actually makes a reference to John Cleese's ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" ...what does that tell you?)

The end bit, when they're all on stage together, is sheer brilliance: not only is it funnier than anything that comes before, but it points up brilliantly the respect and affection they have for each other and their work, to the point of actually being touching.",1289520000,,1251,4.886792452830188

However, that is a great way to bring the audience into the whole presentation.  As Jeff Foxworthy points out, he can observe the connection with the audience, and that is HUGE.

This movie is simply fantastic - and shame on me for not watching it sooner.  It took my now-wife to sit me down in front of it years ago, and I've seen it a dozen-plus times since.

Blue Collar Comedy Tour is a ""movie"" following some of the antics of Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and ""Larry the Cable Guy.""  These segments are relatively brief, comedic filler between hilarious stand-up routines from each of these comics from the same show, shot in Denver, CO.  It ends with the four sharing the stage together for some unforgetable laughs and stories.

1878877,5,B000094FFC,"Absolutely hilarious stand-up comedy film from well-known southern comic Jeff Foxworthy (probably most famous for his ""You might be a redneck if..."" jokes that have reluctantly become a part of the so-called American lexicon in the past 16 or 17 years) and his three longtime best buddies and fellow comedians Bill Engval, Ron ""Tatersalad"" White and Larry The Cable Guy. Out of all the performers in the film I thought Foxworthy, Engval and White probably had the best and most entertaining material. Although I did chuckle at some of Larry's bits but just not as much as I did at the other guys. This was largely due in part to his reliance upon decidedly more crude and juvenile-styled jokes that in my opinion a little bit of goes quite a long way. My absolute favorite part of the film though came in the final 20 or 30 minutes when all four guys brought stools out on stage and joined one another in a final ""impromptued"" (if that's even a word) routine that quite literally had me simply rolling with laughter long after the film ended.

In my opinion, Foxworthy and Bill Engvall are filler. Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy are very funny, I don't care who you are! There is a reason why Larry is the number 1 comedian in the country right now. He's funny. Who cares if he's a fake? It's entertainment, folks!

The contrived scenes between acts were silly and unncessary.

I found Bill Engvall to be especially unfunny. Foxworthy's ""you might be a redneck"" schtick has gotten really lame and stale, just like his act.

Forget Engvall and Foxworthy. The laughs come from the two dudes at the beginning of the DVD.",1167523200,,714,4.590551181102362

All four comedians are different from one another.  Refreshingly, none of them resort to foul language or overt crudity in these films (although there is innuendo and some talk about sex).

My girlfriend and I both agree that Bill Engvall is consistently our favourite comedian out of the four.  Jeff Foxworthy is also very funny.  Ron White and Larry I'm not quite so keen on, but they certainly have their moments.  The final segments in each film with the four of them together are very funny - especially the one where they are showing photographs of each other in their younger years.

Of the three films in this pack, one has fullscreen and widescreen version while the other two are fullscreen-only.  All three films were originally filmed in widescreen, so it's a shame that this boxed set doesn't include the widescreen versions of the other two films.",1166486400,46,1127,4.675126903553299

1878886,4,B000094FFC,"This is a very funny movie and I honestly laughed so hard I was crying.  had never even heard of any of the comedians except for Jeff Foxworthy, and I had only heard some of his ""You might be a redneck..."" jokes.  Ron White is just plain down and out funny. His timing is wonderful, and you don't get what you expect. You do laugh a lot, and you need to put down your beer before he starts talking, lest you blow it out your nose!

Bill Engval is the funniest comedian in this line up. If you don't know Bill's work, watch the movie. You will become a fan. His 'Here's your Sign' stuff is funny, but has gotten like Foxworthy's 'You might be a redneck...' However, Bill shines in that he can talk about anything at home, and have you rolling on the floor.

I've already heard almost all of the jokes in the movie. Ron White and Larry the cable guy basically do the same jokes they did on the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" CD that came out at the end of 2000. Also, almost all of Bill Engvalls jokes were on that CD or his new comedy CD that came out late last year (""Cheap Drunk: An Autobiography""). Most of Jeff Foxworthys jokes are not on a CD, but if you've seen him live sometime during the last couple of years you've heard almost all of them. Actually, you can say that about all 4 guys.

However, if you've never heard of the 4 guys before or if you've heard of them but never seen them live or heard any of their CD's, then definitely go see this movie. The jokes are hysterical. Then you can go and pick up the comedy CD's and see them live. They have new jokes when you see them live.

These guys, as a group and as individuals, are not stupid. You don't get to where they are by being idiots, only by portraying them. They know what they are doing.

This video is about laughing, about laughing really hard because they talk about things that have happened to us, things we have felt. Life is sweet, life is beautiful, life can be ugly and hard, and, often, life, real life, is hilarious.

1878907,5,B000094FFC,"Among all the comedies available today, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD ranks number one in the ""must see"" category. Few comedians can find an audience among a broad range of demographic groups, and with varying tastes among individuals, it's quite difficult to find universally entertaining people. But Blue Collar Comedy Tour showcases four stand-up comics of such ability. The stand-up routines are filmed in Phoenix with intermittent features on the exploits of each of the men as they travel the country on their popular comedy tour. Opening up with all four men fishing in a lake, amazingly even the conversations between these men are hilarious and entertaining. What then could we expect when they take the stage? Only the best of modern redneck, working man comedy...

One of the rising stars of stand-up, Ron White brandishes his liquor and tobacco drenched persona along with a loveable sarcasm to produce one of the better comic routines of the decade. White chronicles his 9-minute plane ride to Phoenix which almost ended in tragedy when the plane was forced to turn around in mid-flight due to equipment trouble. But the event didn't phase the alcohol-induced outlook of White who advises the passenger next to him (a man who has something to live for, unlike White) that if one engine goes out, the other will take them right to the scene of the crash. And to top it off, they'll beat the paramedics by thirty minutes...

White's act is well followed by Larry The Cable Guy, a redneck's redneck who lives by the catchphrase ""Get 'r done!"" Speaking in a redneck dialect that borders on another language, Larry The Cable Guy is a barrel of laughs for any American who loves apple pie. Providing unique insight into the world at large, his audience is presented with the great conundrum of the dog dish water purifier (among other things). Why should he buy a water purifier for an animal that eats its own crap? If you're unfamiliar with this guy's routine, you need to pick up a copy of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD just for him alone (or for that matter - any of these comics merit a full-length DVD by themselves).

Beginning the second half of the movie is Bill Engvall, a comic who takes a more well-spoken, family man approach to his routine. I first saw Bill on The Tonight Show when I was ten years old. He delivered the best stand-up routine I've ever seen, and I still remember much of it word-for-word to this day... Central to the routine was his trademark tagline ""Here's your sign"" (referring to a ""stupid sign"" handed out to people who make dumb remarks). Just like his colleague Jeff Foxworthy, Engvall has managed to keep that tagline not only going, but while inventing a hilarious treasure trove of new material. This guy is just plain funny...

Rounding out the final one-man routine is Jeff Foxworthy, perhaps the most famous of the crowd due to his widely promoted ""you might be a redneck if..."" jokes. Foxworthy starts off with a standard routine that's really funny (this part of his career has been widely overlooked), but then he naturally moves into the part of the routine that people love to hear - the redneck jokes. My favorite of the whole Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is his line ""If a beaver bites off your nipple, you might be a redneck"". Based on a true story, you simply have to watch Blue Collar Comedy Tour in order to understand just how hilarious that one is...

But the funniest part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is when all the comics are finished with their individual routines and they gather together on stage to tell personal stories to the audience. Each story keeps the belly laughs rolling, and each comic has his moments, but Ron White steals this part of the show with his ""tater salad"" story. Recounting the story of his recent drunk in public arrest (he was actually drunk in the bar - they threw him into public), White tells the tale of his rise from a small town in Texas to a life replete with criminal aliases such ""tater salad"" and his fathering of a child named ""tater tot"". You just have to it to really enjoy it!

With a host of talented funnymen, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is grade-A entertainment. Certain to be an enduring classic for years to come, this is one comedy film you don't want to miss...

The DVD Report",1113782400,5,4309,4.639580602883355
1878908,3,B000094FFC,"Of the four featured comics, I was only familiar with Foxworthy (hard to miss him on TV).  I only gave this dvd a mildly supportive rating, since the first two comics, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy were really quite funny and easily held up their end of the foursome.  However, the other two were noticeable drop-offs.  Foxworthy was especially disappointing.  He did not do his regular routine of ""Ya know yur a redneck if...""  A few of these jokes were only done by audience members waiting to enter the theatre.  Those redneck jokes told by the audience were funnier than Foxworthy's set.  I also noticed that he was the least funny one of the four when on camera for the improvisational sections of the movie (at a mall, at a health spa, etc.).  I'm guessing that since he has other videos on his redneck jokes, he was not allowed by contract to those other productions to perform the jokes on this movie.  So the audience might have heard the jokes, but that part was cut from the movie.",1113350400,,997,4.4944444444444445

This DVD shines a light on the ignorant bliss of certain southerners lives.,1111276800,4,389,4.342465753424658
1878911,4,B000094FFC,"Friendship is essential to making a troupe like this work, and from the short clips intermingled between their stand-up it is obvious that these four comedians have been around for a very long time.  They have been telling each other jokes as well as building off each other in hopes to better themselves and provide quality entertainment for their audiences.  This is shown with the last couple of minutes of their performances when they all come out and interact with each other and the audiences.  This provides for some of the funnier moments of the film.  Just to see them talking to each other, laughing at their jokes, and building a continual friendship makes the audience laugh more, Jen and I laugh more, as well as showing us this human side to these soothsayers of day-to-day activities.

This was a very entertaining program to watch on a night where comedy was definitely needed to lighten the spirits.  These four guys are masters of their domain, and while Bill Engvall is our least favorite of them (he just delivers too quickly and less redneck), we still find ourselves laughing all together.  We cannot wait to get our hands on more of Larry the Cable Guy's material and see where he finds the humor in our lives.  Speaking of Larry the Cable Guy, my wife and I were talking about how we think his entire act is just an act.  He is not as redneck as he talks, but instead is building his reputation on it.  If this is true, I am very impressed.  Here he is building his bank account using a voice that is not uncommon here in the Mountains of Virginny.  Also, we were very impressed with Ron White, whom we had never heard before.  His humor is sharp and dark at the same time.  He had my wife rolling on the floor with laughter during 95% of his act.  That is very impressive.  I cannot knock Foxworthy, but if you have ever heard any of his stand-up, you have heard his stand-up.  It hasn't changed that much from when I heard him several years ago.  While I still laughed at his jokes, I did think that he may need to revamp some of his material ... especially his ultra-classic ""You Might Be A Redneck If..."" material.

Overall, we were very impressed with this program and immediately ran out the next night to get the sequel to hear ourselves laugh again and again.  Whether you are a redneck, hate rednecks, or just need something to laugh at, this is for you.  It was a very impressive outing for these guys, and an enjoyable evening for the house.  We loved it.

1878912,4,B000094FFC,"This is one of the best stand-up comedy shows I've ever seen.  The Blue Collar Comedy Tour features well known ""redneck comedians"" Ron White, Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and the headliner, Jeff Foxworthy.

Ron White's alcoholic, chain smoking routine is short, funny, and pokes a lot of fun at drunks.  Larry the Cable Guy has a great shtick with a very heavy, exaggerated southern drawl and really dumb jokes that are hilarious.  Bill Engvall's routine is a little more highbrow and is more of an everyman or ""everyfamily"" comedy routine.  And of course Jeff Foxworthy is well known or his redneck jokes.  All four give very funny performances.

The best part of the show, however, was when all four sit down together after each has done their stand-up routine and start telling jokes and stories.  Some of the material is clearly improvised on stage and when all four are together I was practically on the floor laughing.

This one is definitely worth several laughs.",1108425600,3,976,4.831325301204819
1878913,1,B000094FFC,"ah, the blue collar comedy tour. barring one performer, this is a zero star stinker for the ages. but, for the clever and surprisingly fresh performance that ron white delivers i guess this criminally moronic piece of junk deserves one star.

as i mentioned before, ron white provides the only genuinely funny moments in this entire movie. his stand-up routine, although largely recycled from his other performances, is actually pretty hilarious in some spots. the now infamous ""they call me tater salad"" story of course ends up later in the movie and, as expected, ron white doesn't fail when he kicks his perfect comedic timing into gear. something about mr. white seems surprisingly gritty and authentic when compared to the cardboard-cutout personas of the other headliners. sadly, it only goes downhill from here.

as for larry the cable guy, i'd like to make it known that i live in the south, first of all. and i know for a fact that there is no one, NO ONE, as stupid as larry the cable guy living in the united states. period. he is quite possibly the most annoying comedian to have ever lived, and that's not a joke or an exaggeration. the man's act is an overblown, moronic caricature of every single ""redneck"" stereotype that exists. no subtlety or wit, just groaner after groaner after groaner. it's not that i can't deal with dumb or low-brow comedy (i'm a devotee of south park and beavis and butthead), but larry the cable guy's performance in this movie takes gratingly stupid to the outer reaches of the cosmos. since this guy is basically a religious icon here in north carolina it only makes sense that i can't stand him, seeing as to how every waking moment of my life is filled with dimwits infatuated with him. i hated him even before this movie hit comedy central and gave acne-scarred 15 year olds something to quote once they maxed out their extremely grating and terrible lil' jon and rick james imitations. hearing a chorus of cracking, pre-pubescent voices shouting ""git 'er done!"" every fifteen minutes is a veritable performance piece from hell. i just know this man is going to land me in a shrink's office some day.

poor old bill engvall is sandwiched somewhere in this carnival of retardation at some point and delivers a relatively lame, lethargic performance detailing his life as a suburban dad with a daughter. *yawn*. he is by far the most ""normal"" of any of the other performers and as such, he is rather boring in this format. given the choice of nodding off on the couch or covering my ears and banging my head on the coffee table (a condition induced by a certain flannel wearing cable technician) i'll take engvall's sleeping pill any day.

up next is the definate creme de la crap, jeff foxworthy. honestly i don't understand why this one trick troglodyte is still around but this performance didn't change my mind one bit except that my desire to see this guy give up on the whole comedy thing and take up snake handling is much more embossed on my consciousness. it's just the same typically asinine jeff foxworthy we've all grown to loathe here, folks. he's second only to larry the cable guy in terms of relying on far-overdone exaggerations of southern culture.

if you can make it this far without gouging your eyes out then you're ""treated"" to about 20 minutes of the four comedians bouncing bad jokes off each other. the only reason to stick around for this part is the re-telling of ron white's now famous ""they call me tater salad"" story. otherwise, have fun with your new $18 frisbee. this one is only for people who either huff paint fumes or own toby keith cds.",1107216000,4,3620,4.685534591194968

Redneck comedy needs to curl up and die. The only thing this had going for it is that it was at least better then Rodney Carrington...WORST COMEDIAN EVER!

Best is Ron White. Simplistic look at a moronic society.  Of course, the scotch-drunk smoking act is superb. (`How far will that one remaining plane engine take us?...About as far as the crash sight...) And the infamous ""I was THROWN out of a bar one night..."" scenerio. Excellent.

Larry the Cable Guy. Well, I STILL can't figure out the signature phrase ""Git 'er Done..."" but I have to love the ""Dear Lord Bless the poor pigmies in New Zealand..."" phrase everytime he says something not Politically Correct. And the condensed version of his act is much faster paced than the full HBO version.

Bob Engvill...absolutely great. Have to say, his full 1 1/2 hour HBO special exposes much more of his talent than his 15 minutes here.

Then the guys take a trip through the mall, and the prize is the remote-controlled gizmo that Larry the Cable Guy uses on unsuspecting shoppers, and Larry is the one who is up next, with some really down-home stories in his stand-up.
After the four take a trip to a fancy spa, it's Bill Engvall, the ""here's your sign"" guy's turn, and then it's Jeff Foxworthy, who I think is a totally brilliant, unique comedian.
Best of all, is when the four finish the show together; this is where you're in danger of choking from too much laughter, as the stories zing by you.

Considering the language is PG13 most people might want to pass on renting this...DON'T DO THAT just buy it believe me",1083801600,,558,4.175925925925926
1878966,5,B000094FFC,"Whether you're a redneck or not, there's no doubt in my mind that you'll be rolling on the floor laughing at this movie. It's not like other stand-up comedy movies. There's hardly any swearing, and for the most part the topics of the show (marriage, kids, traveling, etc.) are appropriate. Plus, it's not just stand-up comedy. There's behind-the-scenes footage of the four comedians (Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron 'Tater Salad' White, and Larry The Cable Guy) goofing off in places like a mall, a diner, a spa, and on a lake fishing. And even when the comedy takes place on stage it's still interesting - for about half the show the four comedians are sharing the stage together, with plenty of ""Here's your sign"" stories and other stories, as well as ways to tell if you might be a redneck and various other comedy bits. My personal favorite scene is Ron White's 'drunk in public' story - I've watched it about five times. By the way, if you're wondering about bonus features, there's the typical interactive menus, scene access, and subtitles (English, French, and Spanish), as well as brief biographies of the four comedians.

Although at times it can be repetitive, The Blue Collar Comedy Tour is easily one of the funniest stand-up movies I've ever seen.  Larry the Cable Guy and Ron White mine the more bachelor oriented humor and Engvall and Foxworthy go for the family man routines.  But even though their routines are familiar to people who know these comedians, its still laugh out loud funny!

I like the fact that these guys can make you laugh without cursing at you every 4 seconds.  The DVD has a few minutes of comedy as well as some scenes in the mall and Waffle House that the CD does not have, but when you see these guys perform the joke, the gestures and facial expressions.....it certainly makes the DVD a must have.  The CD is great but the DVD adds that little extra that you need to help get the joke better.  The best part of this DVD is that if you are southern or are from the country, then you will be able to relate to what is said.  That is another aspect of this DVD....these guys are realistic and down to earth, what you see is what you get.  Go get this DVD, you will not be disappointed.",1080691200,,819,3.98159509202454

We really like Larry the Cable Guy and hope for more of his stuff to be on DVD. Of course, everyone knows Jeff ""Redneck"" Foxworthy. This is done at a more laid-back pace, which makes it more realistic. Some of the humor is sexual, but it is done so that youngsters may not grasp it unless they know about sexual innuendo.

Larry the Cable Guy has a style all his own, and it is a riot.  Bill Engval and Jeff Foxworthy are very family oriented and it comes with great insight into family/marriage and is delivered with hilarity.

There are almost no curses, certainly none of the big ones, which is a nice thing to hear today when most comedy revolves around swearing to the point where it is no longer funny.  My personal favorite was Ron White, who is a sight to behold.  Giving his routine with a cigarette and a glass of scotch on the rocks he had me laughing to the point of tears.  This isn't to say that the other three didn't have me laughing equally hard, but Ron's was the best, hands down.  I work in a videostore and bought this the day it came out on DVD.

I was introduced to Jeff Foxworthy long before I ever bought or viewed this item and I had heard of Bill Engvall, a.k.a. the ""Here's Your Sign"" guy.  So I thought I'd take a chance on this, especially after watching the version they played on Comedy Central.  If I may pat myself on the back, this was a good decision.
It's chock full of humor from learning how to tell if your a redneck to learning about the families these guys have been raised in or married into and the daily things that they have found humor in.
However, be warned that, although there is not a lot of profanity from these comics, some of their material may not be suitable for children under 13.  But for the most part the humor displayed on this DVD is pretty family friendly I would say and very, very funny.

The closing scene on stage is the best part.  They all sit around and just kinda talk and it is hilarious!  Bill Engvall does great jokes about his family.  Jeff Foxworthy is funny as usual.  The Cable Guy is a little crude, but something about him reminds me of someone that I used to know.  And of course Ron White is just the bomb.  I love it when he was talking about going to the lady at the front desk and asking for a wake up call at 8:00.  ""It's already 9:00am, sir""  ""I mean 8:00pm...

1879044,5,B000094FFC,"""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is like a gathering of your funniest relatives telling you stories. Even if you don't know these relatives from a hole in the ground, you can identify with the stories they tell and the points they make. The goofy cousins from the great Southern United States are Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. While this isn't a typical family reunion (most of those don't take place in Phoenix, Arizona's Celebrity Theater) these guys have such a connection with their audience that they might as well be talking right to you from across a table.
Ron White opens the show with his drunken sarcastic musings that range from televangelist Robert Tilton (a.k.a. the Farting Preacher) to a Texan's views on the death penalty, all the while sipping on a glass of scotch and puffing on a Marlboro. This guy is so funny he'll have you in tears within the first five minutes he's on stage. He has a delivery style that thrives on pitch-perfect pauses in speech that increase the anticipation of and the eventual impact of the punch-line. He's the best of the bunch.
Larry the Cable Guy, a relative newcomer on the scene within the last three years, strolls on stage looking like the guy who would secretly live in the camping section of Bass Pro Shops. A flannel shirt with cut off sleeves and a camouflage hat adorned with a fish hook are an outfit only upstaged by a thick Southern accent that you could take a chainsaw to. Larry is not topical, nor are his transitions between subjects smooth, but his jumpy personality keeps him one step ahead of his audience, and he's that much funnier as a result. If you've heard his album ""Lord, I Apologize,"" you'd already know that.
Bill Engvall is widely known as the ""Here's Your Sign"" guy. If you don't know him by name, you know him by reputation. He pretty much strikes me as your girlfriend's funny dad. Engvall is a father figure on and off stage. The majority of his comedy revolves around his family. Driving on the road with his sixteen year old daughter, hilarious sexual shenanigans with his wife, and having ""the talk"" with his son.... The list goes on. This is one funny guy.
Jeff Foxworthy was the headliner for the tour, and watching him here, more than a decade after ""You Might be a Redneck"" became a household phrase, you can see why. This is a guy who, like Bill Cosby, was made a better comedian by becoming a father. His language never steps out of the bounds of PG and he's twice as funny as he was back when he was cursing like a sailor in truck stops. As much as I love George Carlin, he could learn a few things from Fox, who talks to his audience in such a conversationalist way that he gets you truly involved in his comedy. He plays off his audience's reactions to specific points and expands them back into his material. He is a born comedian, a funny family man with a gift for storytelling, sure to be remembered as one of the all-time great comedians.
The true heart of this concert DVD lies in the final encore, when all four comedians perch themselves side by side on stools to tell stories that has made each of them laugh through the years. Larry's sister is covered with moles, they call Ron White ""Tater Salad"" (if you can make it through this story without laughing to the point of tears, you have no sense of humor), Bill Engvall's run ins with stupid lost luggage clerks, and Jeff Foxworthy takes no prisoners with redneck jokes inspired by himself and his three colleagues (on all sides, Ron, Larry, and Bill raise their hands to take credit for their redneck heritage).
""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is just a flat out terrific time. It's good-hearted and consistently hilarious comedy that's clean enough to watch with your kids, your grandparents, and your funny Southern cousins you only see once a year. Keep this family reunion piece on your movie shelf.",1071100800,8,3882,4.58705035971223

1879046,5,B000094FFC,"I watched this and within 24 hours I had told all of my friends and family they had to see this. Jeff Foxworthy may be the more popular name, and his skit is great, but.....Larry, The Cable Guy had it all wrapped up by the time he left the stage. I had never heard of this guy until I saw this and I would say he ranks with early Robin Williams, Bernie Mack and Bill Cosby. If not better. Being single and a country boy adds up to non-stop laughs. If you get this you'd better wear some bladder protection or atleast put newspaper on the chair. Remarks on Victoria's Secret, ""Eatin' Britches"" and his dentist, The Proctologist are just a bare minimum of the topics he covers. His other stand up ""Lord, I Apologize"" is even better!!!!! Bill Engvall and Ron White put on some excellent tales as well. At the end of the set all four get on stage and compare stories and that is the ultimate climax of comedy. If you don't buy it...atleast see it! Whether you are NY uppercrust, LA elite, FL retirees or NC backwoods, like myself, you will be able to relate in one way or.....all ways. Definately a must have for the stand up comic in your family.",1070150400,4,1143,4.296296296296297

Don't miss out on his new CD - ""Drunk in Public"".  Some of the material is the same as on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, but there's enough new material and you won't mind hearing Drunk in Public again.  There is an Osama Bin Laden bit that I found disgusting, but your kids won't be listening to this one anyway.
Jeff F., Bill E. and Larry the Cable Guy were all good, but Ron White steals the show!",1069804800,,561,4.314285714285714

One of the things that really impressed me was that all four comedians were not only able to have the entire auditorium laughing as hard as I was, they were able to do it without resorting to profanity or gross-out/shock humor.  A true rarity these days.
If you like to laugh...check this one out!  I can't imagine anyone not loving it (I just ordered a copy for my 76 year old father).",1069632000,2,589,4.288288288288288

1879053,5,B000094FFC,"This is definitely the funniest stabnd up DVD ever. Also,there are no swear words,so almost any English-speaking person can watch this! There is very mild crude humor,but not enough to not let a kid watch this. Here is my review of each comedian here:
Ron White starts this show. he jokes about advertising,tubing,and advertising. He is my third favorite on here.
Larry The Cable Guy continues this show. He has a very thick Southern accent. Most of his routine is about women. Here is is funniest joke:
""I once dated a girl who had nine earrings in this ear,seven in this ear,a ring in her nose and a bolt in her tongue. It felt like making love and working on my truck at the same time. I didn't know if I should kiss her or adjust the torque in her buttcrack. He is deinitely my second favorite on here.
Bill Engvall is next. He is nowhere near as funny as the other three. Most of his routine is about his family,mainly his sixteen year old daughter. I thought his routine was too long.
Jeff Foxworthy closes this show. He talks about the words rednecks use,women and tells a story about a guy he met in Atlanta whose wife's brother got his nipple bitten off by a live beaver.(""That mus have been the first time that the words ""Beaver"" and ""Nipple"" could be said in the same headline without offending anybody"".)He is defintely my favorite on here. At the end,they all get together. Ron White and Larry The Cable Guy tell stories,Bill Engvall tells some ""Here's your Sign"" jokes,(""My car started overheating and a guy asked me ""Did your car breakdown""?I said,""It wanted a cigarette,so I gave it one"".),and Jeff Foxworthy tells some ""You Might Be A Redneck If... jokes. The funniest one is:
""If you've ever stared at a bottle of orange juice because it said concentrate,you might be a redneck.",1069113600,,1796,4.598130841121495
1879054,5,B000094FFC,My husband and I could not stop laughing.  Tears were coming down our faces and we could hardly breathe.  Highly recommend this for anyone who just wants to laugh for two hours,1069113600,,176,4.46875
1879055,5,B000094FFC,"Remember the Rat Pack?  A group of guys that entertain better than anyone else and also enjoy each other's company?
Well, now we have the 'Possum Pack.  These 4 guys are so funny it hurts.  They work the audience better than any group of entertainers I have ever seen.  Toward the end of the show, it's just like you might see in daily life - the guys get together to discuss life and hammer each other.  The stories are funny because they are (mostly) true.  You might come away from some of the bits thinking ""Hey, I went to school with a guy that did the same thing.""
One of the funniest lines (no spoiler, only a teaser): ""It's a good thing those things don't come in biscuits & gravy flavor.""
The coverage of humor is not so much southern humor, but good ole boy humor which applies to every state in the U.S.
Holy Moley - this video is already a classic.",1069113600,,860,4.245398773006135

Contrary to the title, the real star of this show is Ron White -- a borderline psychotic in the mold of Jonathan Winters, Robin Will and Hunter Thompson.
The only downside was Larry the Cable Guy's accent, real Deep South White Trash. I could not understand 3/4 of what he said.",1068940800,,415,4.2

Needless to say, I laughed my butt off! From Larry's ""Git 'er dun!"" to Ron's manager not owning a globe, to Bill's ""Here's Your Sign,"" and with the great man himself, Jeff Foxworthy's ""Redneck jokes, they are all just too funny!

1879060,5,B000094FFC,I laughed and laughed during Ron White's performance.  I laughed until my Coca-Cola sprayed out of my nose while watching Larry the Cable Guy. And it only got funnier! This IS the funniest video I have seen in a while.,1066694400,2,218,4.45
1879061,5,B000094FFC,"This is good clean humor (maybe a dusty line or two but nothing offensive).  We enjoyed it so much we ordered 10 copies for friends.  I'm from the hills of Kentucky before relocating to Detroit and I'm also a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan.  All of the featured artists on this tape are highly entertaining.  This is money and time well spent for a good time.

1879062,5,B000094FFC,"The Blue Collar Comedy Tour isn't just for rednecks or blue collar workers- this is fun and laughter for everyone. There are no cusswords or adult content to cut out so even teenagers can watch this. Funny comedian Ron White is like a 21st century country-style Dean Martin. The other 3 comedians ( Ron White included ) along with Jeff Foxworthy also serve up their fair share of comic lines and laughs. Most people have only heard of Jeff Foxworthy due to his name & longetivity( including me until this ) but once you've seen & heard this you will want to enjoy it over & over. Great that these four comedians decided to tour together,film it & release it on video & dvd for us to enjoy.
Even you are alone you may be laughing out loud. The Blue Collar Comedy Tour was recommended to me by an African-American so it wasn't offensive to him either as he thought it funny-This is definitely not just for rednecks but for everyone. This is not just southern humor-the comedy is universally appealing. Buy it,rent it,don't miss out. You don't have to have a job with a nametag on it to enjoy this one. It doesn't matter who you are- this one's funny. It't not covered in moles. No one will literally throw you out of a place. There's your sign-You might be a redneck but you don't have to be one to laugh at this comedy.",1065744000,109,1318,4.383673469387755

So I went and  got the red neck tape for him, he being a Red Neck and all. (Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The movie). We just laught at eachothers jokes.

I was totally unprepared. This is the funniest thing I've watched in a long, long time.
The format is that each of the comics takes the stage individually, with a little comical short between. I could take or leave the shorts, but the stage comedy was hilarious. After each comic takes the stage, all four come out and joke around, joke on each other, and play off of each others' routines.
I just can't say any more. My wife and I laughed for the whole hour and a half, and the jokes are still running through my head. This is a definite must-see.",1063584000,,739,4.24822695035461

Ron and Larry were relatively new to me, but I tell you, they had me rolling on the floor just as much as Jeff and Bill!  The in-between scenes were just classic!  They reminded me of stuff that my husband and his friends would do, so it was nice to know that there are other people out there just as demented as my husband!

These four have great on-stage chemistry!  The ending of the DVD is the best, where they are all onstage together tellng their stories.  You can see how well they get along, and how much of a riot they must be to hang out with!  Larry's backwoods, none-too-bright act is a side-splitter, and Ron White defenitely fullfills his role as the ""bad boy"" of the bunch.  Bill Engvall delivers with some of his hilarious trademark ""Here's Your Sign"" jokes, and the others get in on the act too.  Though we all love Jeff Foxworthy, I think we are all getting a little tired of the Redneck jokes, but Jeff comes through with some absolutely terrific new  material that will leave you wiping tears of laughter for hours!
