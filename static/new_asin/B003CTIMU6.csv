It is informative & does a very good job of breaking down into categories, Your Reds & whites and everything from wine production to grape types & regions. I would also suggest ""An Introductory guide to wine"" & ""Wine for dummies"". Both surprisingly informative as well.",1368403200,,402,4.597222222222222
