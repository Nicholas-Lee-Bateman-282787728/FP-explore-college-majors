Is possible that in 5 days,( including the end of the year!) ,a package can be shipping so fast?!...
The movie is a jewel for all devotees who want to know more about this amazing place where Baba give his darshan. Very good quality. I offer in first place my Gratitude to the all-knowing Lord Bhagavan Baba Who cares for all  living things always.
I thanks and congratulated the Prashanti team and Amazon for their incredible job  , . Than You Swami.  Sai Ram",1423008000,,734,4.587786259541985

If you have heard of him that means there has been a reason for you to know about him. Follow up on that lead. Namaste. Sairam.",1343520000,,278,3.982142857142857

8414003,5,B0042YC652,"It sounds as if Sam Sandweiss is the narrator of this video footage all from Whitefield/Brindavan of Baba in the early '70's and late '60's.  This is essentially early darshan footage with added soundtrack, mostly bhajans.  The footage is rare and wonderful to see.  You won't learn anything new but seeing Baba during this time period is amazing, well worth the price.",1310947200,,369,4.919354838709677
