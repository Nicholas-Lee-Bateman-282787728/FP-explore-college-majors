8496060,1,B006BGHOLK,Save your money.  I have problems with an 08 Cummins with a Holset turbo. This provided little. way to 1 0 1 and the format is horrible. Its like 12 micro documentaries where you have to watch the credits over and over again for very little information,1411948800,,252,4.361702127659575
8496061,1,B006BGHOLK,Boooooooooooooooooooring audio is poor and seems to be read from a text. The visual is good. Do not purchase this DVD. JD,1368316800,2,121,4.545454545454546
