8085148,4,B000BCLUB0,"While I didn't enjoy this dvd as much as the 1st one, it is still really great. Captain Nemo ( a blonde Adam West type) goes on more adventures with his friends Kris and Robbie. (There is a tad of danger now and then to keep it interesting.)

Episode 1 teaches us about tuna fish; 2 shows us a dangerous and illegal way to fish; in 3, we see how an island can be formed; 4 is arguably the strongest episode. They explore coral caves, learn about the parrot fish, get trapped in a cavein, but then get rescued by a turtle who needs to go up for air.

5 teaches us about metal that forms underneath the sea. We later see how the food cycle can cause a silvery effect. We also meet dolphins who work with people. In one episode we learn about life on icebergs and how polar bears 'never learned to be afraid of man.'

The final episode shows how a battle between whales, killer whales, and sharks can start and end in an instant.

This is a great dvd. If you have any affection for the study of sea life, you MUST see it!",1210118400,,1018,4.100502512562814
