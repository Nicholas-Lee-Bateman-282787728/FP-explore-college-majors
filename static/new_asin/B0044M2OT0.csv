4261393,5,B0044M2OT0,"This cat from Maryland spends EIGHT years on one drawing of Marilyn Monroe. Eight! Once complete, he sets out to show the piece to artist David Hockney, who, the artist believes, will recognize his genius and make him famous. The film is about art, obsession and determination, with wonderfully stranger than fiction characters. Full review on Fell Witness: [...]",1308355200,,363,5.169491525423729
4261394,5,B0044M2OT0,"This film should be part of the curriculum for every undergraduate and graduate art program in the nation -- including writing programs. For high schools it's the perfect instrument to ignite discussion and writing. It's such an important film! Anyone who works in the arts or appreciates them--any of them--should see this documentary. It's magnificently made and crucial viewing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Hockney/dp/B0044M2OT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Hockney</a>",1298764800,4,535,7.375

8416173,4,B0044M2OT0,"In the absence of true talent, techniques along with marketing strategy are attempted as ways to obtain false success. This sad and comical documentary is really about the lies that uninspired people tell themselves (and each other) in order to lift up their mundane existences. A large percentage of todays art world is all about promoting this kind of lying - it starts in the schools and spreads out from there. An incredibly false and moronic (yet surprisingly moneyed) marketplace has been built on this deceptive foundation. It is sure to become another page in the history of human folly, similar to the tulip mania of Holland in the early 1600s  the art mania of the early 21st century. True talent is about inspired vision that subdues the body to create its wonders. It is rare and unique, and therefore, beautiful.",1492905600,3,825,4.851063829787234
8416174,3,B0044M2OT0,disappointing - I'd say this wasn't what I'd expect it to have been. But we did watch it through and actually felt the message came across in the end...hope this starving artist is getting real.,1485820800,,194,4.571428571428571
8416175,5,B0044M2OT0,"I really enjoyed learning about Billy, his technique and his determination.  He has a true gift.  I can't wait to see the next chapter.  It's a tough lesson to learn as an artist, that not everyone is going to love what you have to offer, especially when you put your everything into it.  I wish him the best of luck!",1471910400,,317,4.233333333333333
8416176,4,B0044M2OT0,"It's always interesting to see how quickly many people dismiss a great technical achievement in the arts. There is certainly validity to the criticism that it can lack creative expression if used as an end in of itself. But there also seems to be an eagerness to dismiss any potential threat to the critic's ego. As a musician, I can still admire a spectacular display of technical ability even if it may be artistically lacking. It doesn't necessarily make for great music but it can be significant in its own way. To deny that or immediately dismiss it is too often a convenient way for others to obscure their own shortcomings.",1471305600,,630,4.684684684684685
8416177,3,B0044M2OT0,"It was inspiring, but also grueling to watch. When the movie finally ended, I wondered why this documentary was even created. At best, it was mildly entertaining and insightful.",1466121600,,177,5.137931034482759
8416178,3,B0044M2OT0,A Baltimore artist works for eight years on a very detailed drawing of Marilyn Monroe and then contacts an  art critic to get his thoughts. Surreal. Insightful. Some swearing.,1451779200,,175,5.0344827586206895
8416179,4,B0044M2OT0,"what a waste of 8 years. but, it's his life to waste.",1435881600,2,53,3.5
8416180,5,B0044M2OT0,"So is this the story of an obsession ,a passion or a 10 year neurosis?  That is the question.
I would say the film reveals a very focused artist who wants to turn the art world on it's ear.

And he succeeds....",1364515200,,210,3.9761904761904763
8416181,4,B0044M2OT0,"This movie is not about David Hockney -- he appears only in some still shots and snapshots made in his home during the filming.  What the film is about is that you do no one a service and may end up looking like a dope by encouraging a person's unrealistic delusions.  I doubt that's the message the filmmakers meant to deliver, but when you deal with reality, things may not turn out as you hope.  The protagonist in this film is a young man who has produced a pencil sketch of a photo of Marilyn Monroe that he claims exhibits a degree of detail heretofore not achieved by an artist's hand.  We are told he worked every day, full time, for 10 years on it.  His technique involved using a needle-sharp drafting pencil to build the image a dot at a time.  But since the sketch is only about 14 x 17 inches, we still may wonder what he was actually doing for all those hours.  Apparently, at some point along the way, perhaps after the drawing was done, one of the artist's advisors planted the idea that the painter David Hockney was the very person to pass judgment on the sketch.  It then became everyone's hope that Hockney would be so blown away as to become the young man's mentor and open doors to a great career in art.  One might note that making ultra-realisitc sketches from photos seems about 180 degrees from what Hockney does, so he seems rather miscast in the role of benefactor, and this proves to be the case.

But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the number of grown-up people who abetted this young man all along the way.  These include his parents and various others who should know better.  One would think that surely someone with some knowledge of how you make a living in the art business would have happened along and pointed out that doing the world's most detailed sketch might be fun, but it is not the way to earn a steady income.",1362700800,4,1864,4.402332361516035
