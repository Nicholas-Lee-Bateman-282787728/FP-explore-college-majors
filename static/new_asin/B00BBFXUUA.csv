5570136,4,B00BBFXUUA,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

At some point during the 1800's, the descendents of Nordic Gods decided that they needed to be under the radar. Where better to emigrate to than the sparsely populated NZ.

In the modern day, God like powers are assigned on ones 21st birthday. It is also important to note that the level (strength) of powers has diminished over the years.

Enter modern day and the 4-Brothers Johnson: (on the eve of youngest brother Axl's 21st birthday):

Mike (AKA the God of Chance/Games) - the oldest who essentially raised his younger brothers. Mike lives a relatively normal life, married and working as a building contractor while rarely using his powers

Anders (AKA God of Poetry and the Spoken Word) - runs a PR Company and frequently uses his powers to secure business and personally to separate females from their ""clothing""

Ty - (AKA God of Cold and Darkness) - he is low key and runs a refrigeration business

Axl - (AKA Odin, the King of all Gods)

There is both excitement and trepidation when it is learned that Axl is the reincarnate of Odin. If Odin can reunite with his beloved Frigg (and consummate said reunion), all of the reincarnated Gods will have their powers restored to an unadulterated form!

There are assorted other characters, including Thor (War God), Loki (Fire God) and their Grandfather Olaf (an Oracle that ages slowly and is 92-years old, despite appearing to be in his 30's). Not to mention the Goddesses (included the super hot Michele - the Goddess of Love and apparently hooking up)

The overriding premise of the series is to help Axl find his Frigg (yet to be revealed).

On the surface the show is a comedy. There are many comedic moments along the way, though I would define as more of a fantasy drama in the same vein as Lost Girl (though not as dark). There is also a fair amount of swearing, nudity and ""hooking up"".

If I were to offer a small criticism, it would be that I would have liked to get a better sense of what makes NZ unique (the backdrop).

It may take a few episodes to become accustomed to the ""Kiwi"" accent.

The best news is that there will be a season 3!",1370563200,4,2130,4.556430446194225

5570181,5,B00BBFXUUA,"I discovered this show on Netflix (season 1), but season 2 isn't available yet. Thank goodness for amazon downloading. It's hard enough getting DVDs for shows that originate in the US, but these take longer. In any case, I really like all of the characters and I'll even forgive that pig of a Norse god, usually called Anders. I really like that the characters seem quite real (cars that barely start, money here, now gone, powers gone when needed, etc.). I think that my favorite episode so far is A Damn Fine Woman. When I first read the description, I cringed a bit internally. Would they just throw some clothes an a wig on Axl or would they replace him? I got my wish and thought that it was done very nicely. Too bad this was cancelled again after only 3 seasons.

5570197,4,B00BBFXUUA,"So don't expect depth or complexity, but you may find yourself happily sucked in to this well written tongue-in-cheek series, which offers a fresh comedic take on the theme of gods who walk among us.

5570199,4,B00BBFXUUA,"I gave this series a try though I didn't know anyone who  knew anything about it....and the verdict is I really like it!  People, this show is for grown-ups and not at all for kids!  Plenty of sex and direct talk, drinking and smoking the magic herb, but also a funny and engaging plot about some colorful brothers who just happen to be reincarnated Norse Gods on a quest to get their waning powers back.  Though they speak English, the actors have a serious Kiwi twang that sometimes requires a quick rewind to figure out what was said for this North American guy, but it's lot a really big problem.  This show seems to be maybe 70% aimed at guys and 30% aimed at women, but some women may enjoy it anyway...there are many varied female characters who motivate much of the storyline.  My personal favorite?  Olaf the family oracle who's answer to most questions is ""I don't know...you should really know that!""",1418860800,,911,4.552147239263804
5570200,5,B00BBFXUUA,I've enjoyed the two episodes I watched on Amazon Instant Video. The Show is a mixture of drama & comedy set in New Zealand. You have four brothers and a grandfather who are gods. The story centers on the youngest Johnson brother Axl who is becoming a god and has to deal with all the perks & pitfalls it entails. There are other wonderful  characters that make the show  interesting too.,1418860800,,388,4.450704225352113

5570211,5,B00BBFXUUA,"This is an amazing series.

There is the background with the Norse gods - so, yes, they do occasionally exhibit powers.  But the story is about the characters.  It is complex and surprising at times.  There are characters you just want to write off, but then the story twists and you find yourself understanding their flaws in a different way.

Highly recommend to almost everyone.  There is a lot of sexual situations, but (and maybe this is the New Zealand standards) I found it refreshing to have some of the overt nudity covered up.  A hand in the way or a camera angle doesn't detract from the what was happening in the story - but neither does keeping some secrets.  I am also sure that in New Zealand their language would have a much bigger impact on the viewers than it does in the US.  My husband and I found it rather refreshing that we could understand the slang references but the surprise kid from the bedroom didn't understand the context while we put the video on pause.

But it is the writing that is keeping us watching for each new episode.  We often laugh out loud, and find ourselves talking about what might happen next while we wait for the episode.",1418256000,,1171,4.476415094339623
