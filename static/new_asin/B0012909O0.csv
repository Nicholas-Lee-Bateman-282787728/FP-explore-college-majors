There are Lucha Libre action scenes sprinkled throughout as he talks, but mostly it is just him talking (of course with his mask on).  If you want to actually see Lucha Libre in action this is not the film for you, and I wouldn't spend more than $5 on it.",1371340800,,409,4.575342465753424

8244866,2,B0012909O0,"I bought this DVD hoping to see at least a few of Mistico's matches, what I got was 40 minutes of ego stroking. Oh sure they have a few clips of his matches but that's all they are clips, most of the DVD is spent answering innane questions. I would have liked to see at least one complete match, but all you'll see is the same moves over and over. The clips don't even contain the original commentary by the announcers, so it's great if you like uncomfortable silences.
The people who put this out seem more concerned with singing Mistico's praises than with displaying good Lucha Libre. All in all if you're a diehard Mistico fan go ahead and get this, but Lucha Libre fans should avoid this.",1211587200,9,693,4.37984496124031
