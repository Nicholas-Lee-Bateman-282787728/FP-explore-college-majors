8021668,5,B00023XW3C,Lucky for Freddie Fender today is opposite day. 5 srats.,1511481600,,56,4.7
8021669,3,B00023XW3C,This movie was the lowest budget movie I have ever seen.  The least they could have done was to shoot most of the film during daylight hours instead of in the dark.  It was well worth it though just to be able to see Scott Glenn.,1510012800,,229,3.9565217391304346
8021670,5,B00023XW3C,This is definitely nice and great! I was able to enjoy watching this with some of my friends. Thumbs up!,1489536000,,104,4.25
8021671,2,B00023XW3C,"After having read the book, the movie was just a muddle.  I really liked the book but the movie just didn't follow the book and was disappointing to me.",1402099200,2,152,4.241379310344827
8021672,1,B00023XW3C,"The quality of the film that was used was extremely poor.  I had to strain to watch it,  The story did not follow the book to my liking, in other words, I was disappointed.",1377561600,,172,4.029411764705882
8021673,5,B00023XW3C,"The service provider, Single2Boys has provided me with a Gem of a hard to find film.  This movie has touched the hearts of everyone involved in it, including my father, who has distributed the film, while it was in theatres.  Thank goodness for honest and good merchants such as Single2Boys.",1363910400,,291,4.8
8021674,1,B00023XW3C,"I was IN this movie, and YES, it was AWFUL.  One of the worst I have ever seen.  Only good part was Freddy Fender playing Pancho Villa.  He was really funny, but don't think they wanted him to be.  I'd buy it just because I was in it, but won't watch it for entertainment value.  Goes to show, with Academy Award winning stars, and what started out as a fairly good story, can end up with awful results.  It has been cut, recut, rearranged and re-released with the title ""Texas In Flames"", though I can't imagine why anyone bothered.  I seriously doubt the rehash is any better.",1240531200,3,578,4.345794392523365
8021675,1,B00023XW3C,I purchased this because I have a home in the area it was filmed and I thought it would be fun to see if I recognized any of the locations.  I only watched about 10 minutes of this and couldn't take any more.  I've made better movies with my video camera.  The quality is atrocious.,1211846400,,282,4.090909090909091
