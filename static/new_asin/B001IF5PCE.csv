3648379,5,B001IF5PCE,"I found the film to be very informative, regardless of pre-conceived notions of the 2012 phenomenon. The arguments presented here are not all doom and gloom OR new agey. The panel of interviewees is sensible and well balanced, especially in regards to the astronomical phenomenon and Mayan history. Certainly a thought-provoking piece in an age where change is inevitable.",1233187200,25,372,5.322033898305085
3648380,1,B001IF5PCE,"This ""documentary"" is indicative of what's wrong with our culture lately: the inability to differentiate superstition from science.  People are far too willing to equate anecdotes and coincidence with proof and evidence.

When I was a kid, I would watch things like ""Chariots of the Gods"" and think about how cool it would be if it were true.

But then I grew up.  And I educated myself.  And I learned about science and testing.

The world has been ""almost ending"" pretty much every generation that humans have been around.  Yes, sooner or later one of them will probably be right, but only because humans have finally destroyed themselves or the planet with no help from ancient prophecies.

The bottom line is this: if you're the kind of person who thinks crystals have mystical properties and shoe inserts can withdraw unspecified ""toxins"" from your system, you'll probably like this.

If you're an educated person who's grounded in reality, you'll find this amusing and frustrating.

Of course, when the world DOESN'T end in 2012, we know who'll have the last laugh!",1232755200,22,1071,4.932960893854749

You can check out the trailer on Amazon's VOD section (where you can also download the film) and on youtube, google video, myspace, etc. You'll see that it is sort of the anti-History Channel documentary, where we actually give the experts time to develop their thoughts and keep narration to a bare minimum. I hope you enjoy it!",1226620800,7,535,4.6421052631578945
3648382,5,B001IF5PCE,"I had the pleasure of viewing an early screening of this documentary with a couple of its stars and I was very pleased how the film makers took no sides to the debate of what, if anything, will happen on December 21st, 2012. For every theory there was a counter theory. It even touched on the theory of a consciousness shift. It was a real objective approach to the subject that will be in everyone's mind very soon. The array of experts in this documentary was second to none. The Disinformation Company did a fine job on the production of this video.

The commentaries from all the(credible)experts seemed very well balanced and each gave great contribution and insight.

3648421,1,B001IF5PCE,"Too shallow -- touching upon a potentially serious issue in a very superficial, mass-interest evoking manner. The interviews with marvelous individuals present their perspectives on the topic in a too disorganized, random, out-of-context manner, resembling some sensational news when a reporter interviews witnesses/experts, inserting for the all-believing public the most unimportant and un-revealing  sentences taken out of the larger context, thus intentionally blurring the essence of the concept/ideas those people try to convey. Nothing is really developed in-depth. Thus the DVD becomes ""a sound and a fury signifying nothing.""",1252022400,8,634,6.123595505617978
3648422,5,B001IF5PCE,"Spectacular and beautiful is the photography and illustrations of the movements of the heavenly bodies, and this film contains  outstanding discussions about the Galactic Alignment and end of the Mayan Calendar which was known to other civilizations such as the Incans, Egyptians and referred to in the Vedas apparently. The speakers are esteemed and astute authors, researchers and scientists. They seem very open, candid and unbiased and articulate. Esoteric information is discussed which is very compelling. They also add their personal views and hopes for the next age. Obviously this cycle has occurred before. There is much speculation about what can happen, all unknown. The peak of the sunspots/solar activity is expected to be in 2012. So i also suspect that the intense solar activity and global warming is also a natural consequence of the 26,000 year cycles. I believe the ice at the poles begins re-forming 15 years later, and that these also occur at the end of ea 26,000 year cycle. Also that a polar shift occurs at the end of each cycle, not a physical shift, but a magnetic pole shift which is merely a temporary interruption in man's activities, but can serve as an interum opportunity to reconsider lifestyle, Homo Luminous as told of by the Incas, or  Homo Spiritus spoken of by Dr. David R. Hawkins, which is actually some years in progress now, or the Golden Rule and or Spirituality but that man continues to live in free choice. Great Presentation.",1251590400,13,1474,4.963562753036437

3648424,1,B001IF5PCE,"This documentary is the perfect case of manipulation and twisting of some scientific facts, very creative and clever extrapolation of the Mayan astronomical knowledge, with just the right dose of mysticism and new age to give the impression of truly scientific skepticism. Not a single renowned scientist was interviewed, do you wonder why?  Did any bells ring after the brief mention of the current global warming being caused by the events related to the 2012 prophecy?

This documentary is a perfect example of taking advantage of the ubiquitous gullibility and prevailing lack of rational thinking that is becoming a shameful landmark of our modern western society. The Wikipedia article ""2012 doomsday prediction"" perfectly summarizes the historical and scientific flaws/lies regarding the theories behind this documentary, so I will not waste time on debunking them.

Nevertheless, I was really impressed with the effort to deceive the general public, though it is not as masterful as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and definitively this documentary presents an excellent story for a science fiction/doomsday/action movie. Any resemblance with the 2009 science fiction flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knowing/dp/B001GCUO02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knowing</a>&nbsp;is just a coincidence.

There will be plenty of tsunamis and earthquakes.

For those readers with a genuine interest in debunking this kind of myths or superstitious beliefs I do recommend the reading of the good old Carl Sagan antidote against gullibility,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-as-a-Candle-in-the-Dark/dp/0345409469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</a>.

Our real timeline/deadline could actually be around December 21, 2012.  Alot of us are wasting our time in combat, instead of promoting peace on earth, and not doing enough to protect our planet. Many people may be more concerned about making more money, instead of taking care of the real issues, which is again proctecting our planet, & to live in peace.

What a joke, Every plank second is a new, and the effect of chaos will always undermine such long foretold calculations. The idea of the connection to the alignment of the Universe, the false constellations, all are playing on ideas of fantasy, not acknowledging many other factors of known science.

There have been cries of ""....the world is going to end"", before, of course.  (It often happens every April 15th in the US, just after people finish paying their income taxes.  Maybe the WHOLE world isn't ending....but when they look at their bank accounts AFTER paying taxes....!)  ""End of the World"" theory -- called ""Echatology"", has a long history, and has shown up in MANY religions.  Will this be the FINAL ""End of the World"" time?  Check this video and see!

The Good News:

A very religious Christian lady of my acquaintance has said that 2012 will NOT be the end of the world.  That 2016 will be the end of the world.  She says that 2012 will only mark the absolute SITING of the ""Earth-killer"", asteroid and the absolute CERTAINTY of Earth's axis-shifting.  Then we will have four years to prepare.....

If you know ANYONE contemplating suicide, PLEASE tell them to at LEAST wait for 2012.  Or 2016!  And, also, to remember the very, very wise words of Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld, in his book, ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Health But Were Afraid To Ask.""  (Title approximate.  It's been a lont time since I've read this book, and can't seem to find another copy anywhere -- not even on Amazon, although many other fine books by Dr. Rosenfeld are here.

Anyway, ehre is what wise Dr. Rosenfeld said about suicide, (and not even mentioning 2012).  He said that most people commit suicide because other people are unfair, cruel, or totally nasty to them.  If you commit suicide -- you are proving these people right!  : )

Everyuone has good and bad days!  One way to get more good days is to get more rest and sleep!  (Remember, always, that lack of sleep is one form of torture!  So -- rest as much as possible!  And, shen not resting, get as much excercise and fresh air as possible!  : )

After 2012, we will need the talents of all the good and freedom-loving people we can get.  I believe that most people who are interesdted in 2012 are that sort of people!  So -- listen to this video, and read some books on 2012.  And be prepared!",1305849600,4,2162,4.54025974025974

The video features an array of self-styled experts telling us about the Mayans, the allignment of the heavens, and doomsday.  But there is nothing that remotely passes for empirical evidence.  The Mayans were a primitive people without knowledge of the wheel. a primitive people who sacrificed humans to please a series of angry gods.  And then the Mayans abandoned their cities in the jungle of Yucatan.  And we are supposed to believe their doomsday prediction that ""scientists"" have interpreted to be coming on December 21, 2012.

There were a number of different opinions, but I found very few debunking, though the simple thought of ""What qualifies the Aztecs and other cultures as having any ability to see into the future?
