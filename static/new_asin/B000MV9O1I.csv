2750537,5,B000MV9O1I,"These are classics no doubt.  Can barely remember some of the episodes and I will probably purchase more of these series.  Innocent, funny, simple, corney, but that's how life was in that era growing up. . . innocent",1312675200,,216,4.657894736842105
2750538,3,B000MV9O1I,"Episodes from two fondly-remembered sitcoms of the 1950's, THE LIFE OF RILEY and OUR MISS BROOKS.  Presumably these are the only public domain episodes from either show that were obtainable by Alpha Video; one wishes that there were more volumes of OUR MISS BROOKS especially, but collectors of classic TV series will appreciate them all the same.

THE LIFE OF RILEY:
William Bendix is the affable star of this charming domestic comedy that ran on NBC between 1953-58; in which he plays aircraft riveter Chester A. Riley.  Chester isn't the usual ""Fifties sitcom dad"" with a crisp business suit and briefcase.  Instead, you'll normally find him in his work overalls and a crumpled hat.  Former B-movie leading lady Marjorie Reynolds is his wife Peggy; with Lugene Sanders playing teen daughter Babs, and Wesley Morgan as young son Junior.

Episodes:

""Babs' School Election"" - Chester tries to help Babs to win her campaign to become Class President by ""rigging"" the vote, but instead causes a huge rift between the two.  This was the official first episode; Alpha has incorrectly-labeled it as ""Babs' School Reunion"".

""Riley's Operation"" - A routine tonsillectomy is completely blown out of proportion by Riley, who has a pathelogical fear of hospitals.

OUR MISS BROOKS:
The role of schoolteacher Connie Brooks was one which Eve Arden had the unique honour of playing in three different mediums - radio, film and television.  The TV series of OUR MISS BROOKS was a natural extension from the long-running radio serial, featuring Arden as the wisecracking Miss Brooks; it ran for four seasons on CBS, ending in 1956, at which point Arden starred in a movie version before finally putting the character to rest.  Produced by Desilu, OUR MISS BROOKS was the ideal vehicle for Eve Arden's dry, snappy comedy style.  She'd later go onto the short-lived ""Eve Arden Show"" in 1957, before Desi Arnaz coaxed her back into situation comedy in 1967 with the cult favourite ""The Mothers-in-Law"".  OUR MISS BROOKS also features two more longtime Desilu players - Gale Gordon as Principal Osgood Conklin, and Mary Jane Croft as Miss Enright.

Episodes:

""The Big Jump"" - Connie is asked by Principal Conklin to replace him for a fundraising stunt in which he must jump off the Madison Highschool building whilst wearing a parachute.

""Home Cooked Meal"" - Whilst Connie flirts with Mr. Boynton (Robert Rockwell), Principal Conklin is accidentally locked in the school freezer.

Sound and picture quality is acceptable (""Home Cooked Meal"" is probably the poorest episode of the four in terms of quality); but more than nice for the price.",1287100800,9,2625,5.037037037037037
2750539,3,B000MV9O1I,"My Mom used to always watch both of these shows, so I have sweet memories of not only the TV shows, but of time spent with my Mom. The quality of the film is somewhat degraded, but you are still able to enjoy the shows.  I just wish there were more episodes available.  I would buy them.",1272240000,4,287,4.017543859649122

2750542,1,B000MV9O1I,Terrible video quality. These videos could have been enhanced like the I Love Lucy series. They should be ashamed to sell this product with this type of quality.,1225584000,59,161,4.785714285714286
2750543,1,B000MV9O1I,The sound on the second part of this DVD (Our Miss Brooks) is hardly audible and should never have been released in that condition.  Turning the volume up as loud as possible the audio on the DVD can still hardly be heard.  There are only 4 episodes on this DVD not really making it worth the price of the item. Very disappointing. I am disappointed also in that this item would be sold by anyone being so poorly reproduced.,1194652800,107,424,4.3544303797468356

 the seller was dependable, delivered quickly, and the dvd was in great shape and very audible.
 would recommend this seller to others;  this is a great comedy; Bentley is a lovable character.
Eve Arden is similar to some of the Lucy skits.

8173083,4,B000MV9O1I,"This review concerns the show Our Miss Brooks, and is 4 stars because I'm not reviewing the other show. Just as I judge a movie by how many times I check my watch in the theatre (more than once is mediocre, more than twice is poor), I judge a show I DVR by which one I turn to first after getting home from work. Our Miss Brooks beats The Big Valley, Flipper, Bob Newhart, The Jack Benny Program, the Honeymooners, and The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (the former winners). I was the absolute perfect age, for TV appreciation/addiction during the golden age of TV in the 60's and for shows thereafter extending to this very day, but not born or old enough to watch the earlier golden age of TV starting in the early 50's. But Our Miss Brooks transcends all that, and has shorter commercials and seems to run shorter overall. It's always good with Eve Arden. She seems to be the original career woman on TV and also the inspiration for the sardonic type of woman for decades afterwards. It took awhile to get used to the fake voices put on by Richard Crenna and Miss Brook's landlady, but RC is superb in this show and you get used to it. And the old landlady grows on you too. This is a well written show and the cast can do anything and be great. The tops!",1477094400,,1263,4.266666666666667

I see others complaining about the quality of the reproduction, but it's as good as you could possibly ask for considering the age and state of the art when these were first recorded. It's just fine for watching with no problems. And the sound is fine too. I heartily endorse buying this!",1447286400,,376,4.712121212121212
