3685236,4,B001LM64UG,"At last, season 5 lands, albeit volume 1.

Thankfully, CBS DVD are having a change of heart with Melrose and are getting it back on dvd after abandoning it last year in the u.s., and in 2007 in europe... due to poor sales, i believe.

(although, as of feb 09, melrose season 3 has been again delayed in europe...it didn't arrive feb 9th, instead now due late may, but i for one gave up on waiting for these releases and am thankful for the region 1 releases i can get)

THE DVDS:
On this set, you get part one of season 5 on a 4 disc set- episodes 1-20 of 34. (As i recall, episode 18 (Great Sexpectations) is a two parter, which aired as a 2 hour episode during the february sweeps season of 97, subsequently this was split into 2 separate episodes in other countries. on the case, it's named as just one episode of 19 on the set... but i believe we are getting 20 episodes). regardless, we are getting slighlty more than half the season, 17 would have been half..

volume 2 will probably be a 3 disc set of the 14 episodes left (i hope this will come in april or may, Dynasty had volume 1 in august, volume 2 in october last year of season 3, so i hope we're given a simliarly short gap between volumes).

The set includes:
Disc 1: Living With Disaster (Sept. 9, 1996)
Over Dlck's Dead Body (Sept. 16, 1996)
Moving Violations (Sept. 23, 1996)

THE SEASON:
As for the show itself, season 5 was great for me... a lot of changes occurred during the season, particularly cast changes but the show still didn't lose it's momentum, it's ability to shock, it's strong plots and stories and characters that we cared about... at least not until the finale of the season ... season 6 never took off, the show couldn't recover from the mass exodus by the end of season 5. So, this was it really, the last enjoyable season, in years 6 and 7, fans didn't really connect with the new characters or care about them..
But this is a very satisfying season, because the characters we all knew and loved bowed out with strong stories.
There was Kimmy's cancer battle and battle to hold onto Michael's affections once Megan and him became serious,
Sydney finally got to be her own person this year... and not just Michael's lapdog....in season 4, she became nothing but a comical extra to other people's plots.. this year she found love, first with Carter and then with Craig... and wasn't the finale build-up great... Syd taking on Amanda and putting her and D&D out of business!
Alison and Jake seemed to settle down and were ready to start a family, but Alison got cold feet in the end and ruined it all....
Jane, well jane just lost it for the first part of this season! It was nice to see her get back that nasty streak we saw in her early in season 4 before Richard wore her down... I hated Jane the victim, so I was rooting for her crazy stalking of jake and alsion! Plus, it was nice to have a nut in action since Kimmy was mellowed out this year!

Other pluses this year..
Amanda got her spine back, season 4 and the parezi brothers saga made her such a victim too. She lost her edge... But this year, she was back to her bitchy self trying to assume control of d&d.
Taylor was a nice addition to the cast. Her devotion to Peter by the end of the season was shocking, hitting herself with a door to make him think he was abusing her! Genius, just what Kimmy would have done!

Of course, we did get lots of duds/ copies in the cast this year in anticipation of the exodus: kyle was a copy of jake (the macho hothead stereotype), Sam was the new Alison (starting off a nice girl), Jennifer was meant to be the new Syd (fat chance!) Taylor was the new Kimmy etc.

Somehow, the copying of characters didn't really effect the show this year... it was only when the characters we loved had gone in season 6 that it was clear the producers had made big mistakes in allowing so many central character's leave although most had run their course truthfully.

The Split Season Problem:
It isn't ideal to have seasons split but i see amazon are today offering it for $26.99, and that is half what i paid for seasons 3 and 4 on amazon on their release date so maybe volumes 1 and 2 of this season will work out similar to what we paid for complete seasons in the past (before sales, reductions). ultimately, fans have to accept that we are a niche market- it's the old supply and demand scenario--not enough people are interested in buying this series to make it profitable, so we have to be prepared to pay some premium to make it viable to release the show any more... and split seasons is this premium.

In short, it is a a pain, it isn't truly necessary BUT I for one am simply glad that season five (the last truly enjoyable season) is making its way to dvd at ALL.

We have a choice: accept what we are getting and be grateful for small mercies and just accept that Paramount could easily do without the hassle and effort of releasing a series that has to date not been very profitable. Paramount can and will make more money, easily and quickly with other titles like CSI etc which have mass and current appeal, Melrose on the other hand won't make them much.

I don't like siding with Paramount ... I know it would be fairer for us as consumers to get complete seasons ... but the past year has taught me to be happy with what we get.

3685245,3,B001LM64UG,"Seasons 2 &3 were the best. Season 4 started to slow down. Season 5 was very dull, but I paid enough for it so I watched it, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  It was still entertaining, but if I would have started watching the show in season 5 I would not have continued.  The actors were all fine, but the writing didn't have much life. You see this in most shows...the last few seasons start to become boring.  Dallas in my opinion is the perfect example of this. It was the greatest show, but the last season was horrible and dryer than my hair.

I do remember liking the last season of Melrose Place when it was on the air, but I was young and easily entertained, but going on season five I will not be buying seasons six and seven unless I find them at goodwill for cheap.",1388793600,,783,4.098039215686274

3685258,5,B001LM64UG,"This season was a lot better than I remember.  When it aired originally I was starting my freshman year in college and didn't have time to be in front of the television every Monday night so I saw less than half of the season.  I do remember being not so impressed with this season because of the sudden thrust of new characters.

Longtime series regular Daphne Zuniga (Jo Reynolds) said goodbye in the season four finale.  The fourth season bid farewell to short-term cast member Kristin Davis (Brooke Armstrong).  Although Kristin Davis' presence was never really missed after she left Melrose (the character just didn't fit), Zuniga's absence left a huge void in the character dynamics of many of the series regulars.  Missing was the sometimes-messy friendship between Jo and Alison (Courtney Thorne-Smith).  Alison's friendship with Jane never seemed quite as legitimate without Jo around.  Also, the character of Jake (Grant Show) suffered in Jo's absence.  While he certainly had more chemistry with Alison than he did with Jane, Jake never really quite fit with Alison either.

Early in the season, long time regular guest star Patrick Muldoon (Melrose Place's longest running guest star, pretty much an unbilled series regular in the fourth season) got his pink slip when his good-guy-turned-creep Richard Hart was justifiably gunned down.  In episode 15 of the season, series regular Josie Bissett (Jane) departed the series after suffering a miscarriage.  It's interesting to wonder what would have become of Jane had Bissett not left the series, considering what the writers threw at her this season.  As contracts came to an end, season five saw the departures of four more series regulars.  Marcia Cross (Kimberly) left in episode 27.  Grant Show (Jake), Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Laura Leighton (Sydney) departed in the fifth season finale, six episodes after Cross' departure.

To compensate for the rash of departures, Melrose introduced a swath of new characters.  Brooke Langton (who first appeared at the very end of the fourth season) joined the cast as Samantha Riley, a new love interest for Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue) and Craig Field (David Charvet), also new to the cast.  Charvet's character would also serve as one of the foils to Amanda's marriage to Peter.  Lisa Rinna and Rob Estes joined the cast as Taylor and Kyle McBride, a married couple from Boston who would provide a constant source of drama for Amanda and Peter.  Taylor has a deep connection to Peter's past and manipulates Kyle, Amanda, Peter and almost everyone else she comes into contact with.  Kyle had a promising connection to Sydney but that is cut short.  Kelly Rutherford came aboard as Megan Lewis, a prostitute who falls in love with Michael (Thomas Calabro) and has a very surprising friendship with Kimberly (Marcia Cross);  Though Rutherford was heavily featured in the first half of the season, she is not billed in the opening credits until the 16th episode of the season, immediately following Josie Bissett's departure.

The storylines and writing in season five are just as sharp and edgy as the previous two seasons, suffering only slightly from cast/character rotation.  Fitting (and even shocking) send-offs are given to departing cast members.  Doug Savant (Matt Fielding) does appear and is billed in the opening credits for the sixth season premiere, though he departs in that very episode, so essentially season five was Savant's last.  One of my biggest complaints is the final scene between Alison and Billy (it felt rushed) and the lack of final scene between Alison and Amanda (Heather Locklear).  As longtime foes who sometimes tried to be friends, Alison and Amanda deserved a final scene together.",1326240000,,3724,5.110743801652893

3685261,4,B001LM64UG,"Season 5 (at least the first half, presented in this DVD release, continues the drama, theatrical personalities and action of the series. This season introduces a few new characters to the fold, such as Kyle and Taylor and one of the character's birth mothers played by Donna Mills while offering an exit for some characters including Richard and Jane. In many ways, the first half of season 5 is really all about Jane; the season starts off with her and Sydney trying to deal with Richard and this set ends with Jane leaving Melrose Place after a lot of drama and twists, including stalking Allison, breaking up with Jake and attempting to disown Sydney and her family. Season 5 also deals with Peter's past, Amanda being under the gun at work and Kimberly getting a bad diagnosis that has her preparing for her death.

Plot: Season 5 was good, but it still felt a bit off to me in terms of characterization. Jane seems completely over the top and psychotic, while Sydney is tamer and  (though she has her moments). Allison is one character that seems really lost this season and as if the writers had no idea what to do with her other than get her involved  with yet another resident at the apartment. Billy also seems lost in the fold this season, getting involve with a new character who really is boring and unappealing as a character. In all, season 5 felt like a somewhat unsteady season with the producers not being sure where the characters, or their plot lines, were going. A lot of the character's actions seemed random, confusing and motivated only by the producer's desire to keep up with the show's reputation of being dramatic, racy and surprising. Still, it was a lot of fun watching the craziness that occurred and I thought the one thing the season did do really well was attempt to shake up the character's relationships: we got to see Allison and Billy really support one another as friends and get beyond their romantic issues, Jane basically turn on Allison and Jake out of spite and jealousy, Sydney put aside her usual scheming to be a real sister Jane, Jake and Billy were on the outs, Peter began standing up for Matt and Kimberly and not just for Amanda and Kimberly and Michael reconcile. Seeing these relationships change and dynamics change is what made this season really stand out.

DVD: I really had no issue with the transfer of the video or audio to DVD. What I did have issue with, and what caused me to take away a star when considering this season, was Paramount's decision to suddenly break up each season into volumes. They've done this with other shows, including 'Dynasty', and it seems ridiculous and nothing more than a marketing ploy to squeeze out more money from sales. This far into the series, I feel cheated as a consumer in having to not only spend more money for an entire season but now I have to wait even longer for just half a season to be released. It'd be one thing if they cut the price in half to compensate for only offering up half a season but that's not the case. So we're left with an incomplete product and no extras of any sort on top of that.

In all, 3.5 for the content itself but not at all a fan of the release format (half a season, lack of extras). Get it for the sake of having the episodes on DVD but face the fact that you'll have to purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-Place-Season-Five-Vol-2/dp/B00168ML34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose Place: Season Five, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;to complete the entire season.

Jane deals with quite a bit this season.  Richard doesn't die and comes back for her and Syd.  Jake and Allison hook up and Jane starts stalking them and acting crazy.  Jane also found out she was adopted (Syd is her parents ""real"" kid) and she finds her birth mother.  Overall, Jane's story this season was a little annoying, so when she left to go make a fresh start, it was sort of a sigh of relief.

The Good>>>
The Jane/Sidney/Richard subplot is wrapped up
Peter is cleared of killing Bobby
Matt gets help for his addiction
Kimberly lives
Sexy Megan gets introduced
 Brooke Langton was just sooo fine
Donna Mills as Jane's birth mother was a nice touch

Now for the bad>>>>

Lisa Rinna & Rob Estes,
Don't get me wrong I really liked Rob Estes on ""Silk Stalkings"", & he was at the time married to Josie Bissett(Jane), but here his talents get wasted, him & Rinna had absolutely NO CHEMISTRY!!! None, zero, zilch!!!
Hunter Tylo who was fired for getting pregnant(& later sued) would have been Taylor(Rinna's character) & would have had much better chemistry with Estes no doubt

David Charvet was o.k. as Amanda's rival, but not that intimidating as he should have been

Megan(Kelly Rutherford) got a good introduction as Michael's new love interest, but it seemed the writers just didn't know how to make her more interesting

Alison & Jake are given a romance that fails miserably, I mean did making these two romantic make sense, they had nothing in common, talk about wasting two good characters

Apparently the writers didn't really know what to do with Peter & Billy
They just seem to be going through the motions

& Sydney is given a new romance with a Bill Gates type character, but again the writers could not make it interesting

& then there is Kimberly is also just going through the motions

& finally Matt gets involved with an abusive guy (Greg Evigan in a thankless role) that goes nowhere!

It is clear that creator Darren Starr was gone, he had left in Season 4, but had pretty much laid out the groundwork for Season 4, but it is clear that his successor Frank South had no clue what to do with these characters in this Season,

but this one is still watchable, reasons to get the second half>>>

Alysia Milano as Mancini's conniving sister
Sydney's attempt to expose a fraudgulent woman who falls in the Boutique
Sydney & Craig(Charvet) taking down Amanda toward the end
Jake finally accepting his job as a parent to the son he gave up in the first season.

Although a poor season, it is nowhere near as bad as Season 6 & 7!!!",1236643200,2,2526,4.545253863134658

3685295,2,B001LM64UG,"'Melrose' was a guilty pleasure of mine when it originally aired, and I've been rewatching the seasons on DVD as they've been released.  Seasons 2 and 3 are campy fun, and quite entertaining.  By season 4, the quality of the show had significantly dropped, but at least there were a couple of interesting subplots going on to make it worth watching.

That brings us to season 5.  Virtually all of the cast remains from season 4, with the exception of Daphne Zuniga.  New actors include Lisa Rinna, Rob Estes, Brooke Langton (introduced late in season 4), Kelly Rutherford and Greg Evigan.

On my original viewing in the 90's, this was the season that finally convinced me to stop watching 'Melrose'.  It's not that it's awful; it's just painfully, painfully dull.  I'm through 13 of the 19 episodes, and I literally can not name a single interesting subplot.  It's not even that any of the new actors are as bad as Andrew Shue, it's just that the writers have run out of interesting ideas.  It's somewhat similar to the first season, actually, and believe me when I say that's not a compliment.

Marcia Cross and Laura Leighton, who IMHO carried this show during its peak, are given nothing interesting to do during season 5, which is just a crime.  This whole season is really a shame, considering the campy peaks of previous seasons.

If seasons 2 and 3 are 4.5 stars, and season 4 is 3.5 stars, I'd give season 5 2.5 stars, and that's only because I know (actually, i don't know this for a fact, but it seems to be consensus) season 6 is even worse.  However, it gets docked half a star because of this ridiculous half-season business, which means that there isn't even closure on most of the subplots unless you buy/rent another set of DVD's which may or may not come out in a year.

The nostalgia factor for me is the only thing keeping this season higher than 1.5 stars, because for me, it really has been roughly as entertaining as watching paint dry.  Very disappointing.",1236297600,2,1979,4.595441595441596

3685306,5,B001LM64UG,"I was all excited to get the fifth season in the mail today until I opened the box and realized it was only for the first half of the season.  I found it a little crappy since we as consumers have been waiting for almost a year for this.  Anyway, GREAT season a must have!",1235692800,,272,3.9272727272727272
3685307,5,B001LM64UG,This season was great. The only part my daughter was unhappy about was when Syd got ran down in her Wedding Dress at her Wedding. Does anyone know when Vol. 2 of this season will be out? my daughter can't wait.,1234742400,,210,4.146341463414634
3685308,5,B001LM64UG,"I  just received this in the mail today!!! Can't wait to pop it in. I LOVE this show! Also, it contains 19 episodes, not 17 or 15 as stated in previous posts.",1234137600,,158,3.9375
3685309,5,B001LM64UG,It shouldn't matter If the seasons are split up at all as long as this series continues to be released. I just strongly hope it continues to be released pleaseee  continue to release.,1233619200,,183,4.545454545454546
3685310,5,B001LM64UG,"I've heard the remaining seasons have been split into parts ones and part twos as the previous seasons haven't sold well at all and from now on will be done on a previous sets sales!!! So please buy Melrose place! It was great!!!!!! It's already bad enough the boxsets don't match after season 3s case style, but to not have the full series and to leave it half way through a season would be heartbreaking!!!",1232064000,,408,4.453333333333333
3685311,2,B001LM64UG,"I was getting scared that they DID abandon the series and stopped releasing Seasons on DVD!
They WERE coming out simultaneously with 90210,then Season 4 or 5 of 90210 came out-and no Melrose....
And the last Melrose packaging got a little less ""boxset-ish""...
I was hoping that if they abandoned releasing Seasons,that they would just release The Complete Series for an affordable price,ie:Knight Rider,News Radio,I Love Lucy,I DReam Of Jeannie,etc...
I mean there's only 2 Seasons left...just release them,and don't make as many!
I know MADTV got ""left in the dust"" with getting Seasons released on DVD-Season 1 came out,and then like a year later a lousy Best of Seasons 8,9,& 10 was released...and you can get Season 13 on iTUNES?
That's it!
I want the Will Sasso Seasons!
Anyways....off subject!
I'm just glad to see Season 5 of Melrose is FINALLY coming-even though it's split up,I'll still buy it!",1231113600,,903,5.026666666666666
3685312,5,B001LM64UG,"Melrose Place was the perfect prime-time soap in the mid-90's and I am little surprised season five isn't going to be fully released like the other seasons. Apparently, season 4 didn't sell well and so the studio is only putting half of season five's episodes on this DVD, what the hell? I am so disappointed but hey this show was amazing, all the backstabbing, all the sex, and the fake deaths, what more could you want? Buy this today!",1230854400,,437,4.544303797468355
3685313,5,B001LM64UG,I can't wait until this season comes out. I remember it being one of the better years of MP. BTW..the cover looks great!,1230595200,,120,4.260869565217392
3685314,5,B001LM64UG,"This is dedicated to all of the diehard MP fans and anyone else who appreciates drama, theatrics and humor.

This is a 4-disc set which will include the first 15 eps of Season 5. The reason why Season 5 is coming out in volumes is twofold. The fourth season didn't sell as well as expected and last summer CBS Video canceled the release of the full season boxed set. Because of an intense grassroots effort from fans the studio has decided to roll out the season in volumes, starting with this set, hitting stores in Feb. '09. If this sells well they will continue to release it (MP was on for 7 full seasons). The second reason why this is being released in volumes is because this season (like every MP season) was incredibly long. More than 30 full eps (some of which were 2 hours long). There was no other series in American primetime television that produced more eps in such a short period of time.

Watching Season 5 is like watching p0rno minus the really bad acting (well, mostly) and incredibly fugly chicks! It's cheap and vulgar and obscene and I love it!!! On one ep Amanda could be having a drunken roll in the sack with Craig on another she could be running into Kyle's cockpit! And, when sex-crazy Michael wasn't getting it at home (everyone's favorite kook Kimberly was suffering from a severe case of frigidity) he simply found a hooker (courtesy of his wife!) who satisfied all of his needs. Wasn't it so funny when Amanda made that pathetic celibacy vow? It only lasted about as long as it took her to slip out of her micro-mini! Just about everyone is getting their mojo strung. Except, of course for poor old Hilda Morris! Although, I seriously think that if Syd had fixed Hilda up with one of the resident-hotties (Jake, Billy or Matt, although he doesn't swing that way) Hilda would have dropped her ludicrous lawsuit quicker than you can say ""G-Spot."" Speaking of g-spots, didn't Taylor look like she was always getting it on with herself. It looked like she was always in this extreme heat of passion, like she was having an intense o-r-g@-s-m all the time! And when Peter came buzzing around her Taylor simply couldn't wait to jump his bones! Surprisingly, always-hungry-for-sloppy-seconds, Alison, only plays leap-frog with Jake during this Season! Although, Jake is enough man to satisify any woman! He's like a big, juicy, meaty, steak; you just can't wait to wrap your lips around it...! ...Like a Virgina Slim, it always fills your mouth with flavor! ...I tend to think that Samantha Riley used her sex as a weapon to control Billy. She was more shameless than Taylor and Megan. How else can all of those idiotic things that Billy did for her (he took her in after only knowing her for like what a month? took in her jail-bird daddy and supported them both!) be explained, otherwise? ...Even Arthur Field got into the act. Although Amanda made another one of her asinine threats to him, ""I'll sue your pants off you."" Field quickly replied, ""you don't have to sue me to get my pants off."" Yuuuuck!! That ugly, old thing looks like Mr. Burns! But I'm sure Amanda would have jumped on his soul-train if she needed help advancing at D&D!

These are the Season 5 Usual Suspects, Guests, Recurring Stars & Various Nobodys:

** Thomas Calabro / Dr. Michael h-o-r-n-y-as-a-toad-Mancini (he was the only character who was on the entire Series, without leaving; on entire Season)
** Heather The Star Locklear / Amanda ""Queen of the Jungle"" Woodward (on entire Season, after all she's the Star, although by now, she is getting very overdone)
** Andrew Shue / Billy boring-boring-boring Campbell (regrettably, he was on the entire Season)
** Josie Bissett / Jane Mancini (on up until the middle of Season 5 when she left the Series; she came back just over a year latter in Season 6)
** Courtney Thorne-Smith / Allison Parker (Allison's name has been spelled with both 1 ""L"" and 2, for this review, I'm spelling it with 2.) (on the entire Season too, thankfully it was her last)
** Grant Show / Jake the-sexiest-man-in-the-world Hanson (Jake was my kind of man, young and dumb and eager to please; on the entire Season; but this would be his last, sadly!)
** Doug Savant / Matt the-token-g-a-y Fielding (almost as boring as Billy, on the entire Season)
** Jack Wagner / Dr. Peter Burns (aka Dr. Feelgood or Dr. Jungle-Fever) (entire Season)
** Laura Leighton / Sydney Andrews (entire Season, this would also be Syd's last!)
** Marcia Cross / Dr. Kimberly (the most desperate housewife there is!) Shaw (left during the middle of Season 5, sadly because she was my favorite kook!)
** Rob Estes / Kyle (the Jake-wannabe) McBride (entire Season)
** Kelly Rutherford / Megan the-happy-hooker Mancini (originally Lewis) (started after the Season began in a small part that flourished into recurring status, similar to what happened to Lexi (aka ""Mood Hair"") in Season 6)
** Brooke Langton / Samantha Reilly (I hated this one more than even Allison, on entire Season, unfortunately)
** Lisa Rinna / Victoria ""Vicki"" Taylor McBride (I love Taylor & her big lips, on entire Season)
** David Charvet / Craig Field (after Jake, Craig was the hottest man in the building, started after the Season began, but was on the rest of the Season)
** Alyssa Milano / Jennifer Mancini (only had a small recurring role, towards the end of the Season, although she'd be back in Season 6)
** Patrick Muldoon / Richard Hart (left towards the beginning of the Season after like the 2nd ep, BTW, did get you a load of Richard's hirsute? Very sexy!)
** Dey Young / Dr. Irene Shulman otherwise known as ""that Shulman Creature"" by Taylor (only had a small recurring role, but she always managed to make a big splash (pardon the pun) when she was on)
** Katie Wright / Chelsea Fielding (only had a small & boring recurring role)
** Greg Evigan / Dr. Dan Hathaway (in the only, and I mean Only time in the entire history of ""Melrose,"" Matt was involved in an interesting storyline, thanks to Dan, only on part of the Season in a recurring role)
** The late Scott Plank (he passed away in 2002) / Nick Reardon (not on entire Season, just had a recurring role)
** Edie McClurg / Hilda Morris (only on 3 eps, but this big-mama always managed to snatch the spotlight from Syd)

These are the Season 5 eps:
Living With Disaster (Sept. 9, 1996)
Richard starts playing with Jane's mind. Amanda travels out of town to gather information on her new husband, who's still in the slammer. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman in Boston (Taylor) reads of Peter's incarceration in the society papers and takes the red-eye to LA!

Over Dlck's Dead Body (Sept. 16, 1996)
Fist of all, don't you love the title of this ep? So ""Melrose Place!!"" Jane and Syd are still being tormented by Richard (YAWN!) Meanwhile, Taylor sets up shop at The Building and even rents Jo's old apartment.

Moving Violations (Sept. 23, 1996)
Syd and Jane get away from Richard's hairball scheme to entrap them. Jane's dumbbell roommate, Samantha comes to pick them up. Taylor brings Kyle by to see their new apartment. By the way, did you notice how incredibly nasty and sarcastic Amanda was to her? I mean, she was even mean-spirited by her own standards. Amanda's claws really came out when Taylor sashayed by. What was up with that?

Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love (Sept. 30, 1996)
Peter fires Sydney for selling his house while he was in jail and she threatens him with a sexual harassment suit. I love what Peter says to her: Lady, I was in jail for murder, a sex-charge would be a walk in the park! Speaking of fires, Jane accidently ignites a fire at Allison's new pad, just as sexy Jake is removing his shirt!

Un-Janed Melody (Oct. 28, 1996)
Pretty-boi Billy thinks he's too good for Jane when she tires to jump his bones, in an apparent scheme to win Jake back and make Allison envious. ...Taylor overhears Kimberly (who, after being investigated by the Medical Review Board gives up her medial license, is now Peter & Michael's receptionist) state that Peter is out of town on his honeymoon and just so happens to show up with Kyle! Amanda is less than thrilled to see them, especially Taylor. Field shows up at D&D and makes some waves with his eager-to-please son. And, in her ""Melrose"" debut, we meet everyone's favorite happy hooker. BTW, did you get a load of Megan as she was doing her little jogging routine on the beach? Things were moving in all different directions, like a bowl of jiggley jello; it reminded me of Tanya Harding in a spandex.

Jane's Addiction (Nov. 4, 1996)
Jane's still up to her (getting old) tricks as far as Allison and Jake are concerned. The malice (or should I say dementia) continues when she slashes Jake's tires. Meanwhile, Dan helps Matt with his dependency issues.

Young Doctors in Heat (Nov. 11, 1996)
Amanda is especially critical with Peter and they both fight like cats and dogs. (BTW, have you ever noticed that Amanda enjoys the chase even more than actually being caught? It's like once she's caught and has her man she's no longer happy and tries to ruin it.) Later in the ep, a very inebriated Peter ""sleeps it off"" on Kyle & Taylor's sofa while Taylor licks her lips as she stares him up and down. Michael is seeing a mystery woman who he's trying to learn about. Megan theatrically opens up her robe (to reveal her undressed body) and says to Michael: everything you need to know about me is right here. Also in this ep, Allison confronts Jane, regarding her loony antics.

Mission: Interpersonal (Nov. 11, 1996)
Note: both this ep & the one prior aired on the same date, however this is not a 2-hour show, it's 2 different eps. Taylor tells Peter who she really is and tries to ingratiate herself in his life. After an over-the-top breakdown Jane finally realizes that she was misdirecting her rage towards kind-hearted Jake (it was really Richard who she wanted to hurt.)

Farewell Mike's Concubine (Nov. 18, 1996)
Michael gets more serious about Megan, however Kimberly wants the relationship to end. And as we've learned in the past, what Kimberly wants Kimberly usually gets! Samantha (the little ice-princess) is put off when Craig tries to hop in the sack with her (what was she waiting for an engraved announcement on Wedgeford Crystal?)

Nice Work if You Can Get It (Nov. 25, 1996)
Craig pulls off a hostage take-over of D&D. Field makes allies with Amanda saying: unusual times call for unusual bedfellows. Meanwhile, Kyle beds Syd. And this is why I really didn't like Kyle. OK, yes his wife was huge hore, but he was really no better! And besides, what's good for the goose is good for the gander! Later, Jane goes home to visit her parents, because as she put it: I just don't know who I am anymore. I always liked Jane & Syd's mom, Katherine Andrews (Gail Strickland.) (Wasn't she somewhat of a drama-queen?) Anywho, Jane finds out that she was actually adopted and runs back to LA in search of her biological parent. Also on this ep Dan has a little scuffle with Jake who wants to know why Matt quit without giving him notice. (Matt was too scared to speak to Jake so he told Allison.) When Jake finally confronts Matt at Shooters, Dan says, ""he doesn't have to give you notice."" Jake replies, ""what are you his lawyer."" Dan, ""No, I'm his lover.""

Sole Sister (Dec. 2, 1996)
Kyle pushes Sydney away (you should know by now Syd's never been afraid of a wedding ring.) Craig is still hot for Samantha and even rents her a working studio. Dan is confronted by a former lover who makes a scene while Matt looks on in shock.

Quest for Mother (Dec. 9, 1996)
Kimberly no longer wants anything to do with Michael after finding out that her condition is terminal (she has a brain tumor!) Peter and Taylor light a candle in Beth's remembrance. And, Amanda is getting more and more peeved by Big-Peter's behavior. (I bet Taylor wouldn't mind getting her hands on Big-Peter!) Meanwhile, Jane finally meets Sherry (Donna Mills) her long-lost birth parent.

Crazy Love (Dec. 16, 1996)
Jane gets closer to Sherry, however the relationship is strained. Samantha acts like a big baby over her stupid paintings and even gets Billy involved. Billy gets the ""board"" at D&D to get Craig to take down her paining. OK, this is another hairball subplot. Hello, did the writers forget that Craig was the owner of the company? Billy said something like: Oh, I just sent an email to the ""art review committee"" telling them that it did not meet standards. Gimme a break, guy! You're so full of yourself!

The Accidental Doctor (Jan. 6, 1997)
Both Kyle and Michael play matchmaker as far as Amanda and Peter are concerned. Dan becomes physically abusive with Matt. I dunno about you, but I think it's pretty hot watching 2 g-a-y men fight. They should make a sport of it. G-a-y boxing?

Escape From L.A. (Jan. 13, 1997)
In another dramatic ep, Jane leaves LA for the safety of her parents' home, back in Chicago. (This will be Josie's last ep for more than a year!) I love how Katherine goes running after Sherry to ""thank her."" Meanwhile, Dan's able to convince his little leap-frog partner, Matt, to be his new permanent bunk-mate. However, after the move is nearly completed Dan attacks him. This time the usually docile Matt grows a backbone and fights back, giving Dan a much-deserved clock in the face!

Eyes of the Storm (Jan. 20, 1997)
Michael feels beholden to Kimberly (God knows why?) Amanda blackmails loose-lips Craig with the info that he spilled about his father. Dan and Matt exchange words in the courtyard, but being the perpetual good-guy that he always is, Matt refuses to allow Dan to ""leave in that condition."" Dan spends the night at Matt's (but not in the same bed.)

Better Homes and Condos (Jan. 27, 1997)
Kimberly is able to save Michael (after he and Megan went chasing after her in another one of her attention-seeking tricks) in enough time. Syd takes Jane's old apartment and Samantha (who isn't even paying rent!) puts up a foolish fight. (Did I tell you I can't stand this girl?) Sydney also gets more serious with Carter (Chad Lowe) in San Francisco. Also during this ep, Kyle's old bosom-buddy Nick comes for an extended-visit! Everyone seems to enjoy the presence of Nick. Everyone except for Taylor McBride! BTW, I love it when Nick says to Tayler (in a couple of eps later:) look, you little hore, I want you to be a wife to Kyle.

Great S-e-x-pectations (Feb. 3, 1997)
Note: this is a 2-part ep. Megan starts getting jealous of all the time that Michael is spending with Kimberly. (I suppose breaking up their marriage wasn't enough for her?) Taylor finds out that the new hospital chief-of-staff got the position because he was getting into his own weird positions with Dr. Shulman. (Talk about working hard for your money! My goodness, I bet even Shulman's snatch has teeth!) And, Taylor gladly relays the info to Peter who uses the gossip to his advantage. Never one to pass up an opportunity, Peter walks into the lady's lockeroom (@ Wilshire Memorial) while Shulman is changing and says to her: I know he's a married man and you're having s-e-x with him. And surprise, surprise! Peter soon becomes the new big chief at the hospital! In the second part of the ep, Kimberly begs Michael to sleep next to her for ""old times sake."" Craig is thinking with his other head when Amanda manages to get him to sign over half his portion of D&D to her! Speaking of Amanda, she dramatically chases after Allison when she decides to go and visit Meredith (after a fight with Jake and realizing that she was pregnant.) And upon her return, Allison stays with Amanda instead of going back to Jake's. Did I miss something? Doesn't these 2 hate each other?

Catch Her in the Lie (Feb. 10, 1997)
Michael sleeps with Kimberly and Megan is very upset. (It wasn't fully established, but this is a rare ep when I believe ""sleep"" just means sleep, not s-e-x.) Also, Kyle gives Carter a job. After bungling a bunch of tasks, Taylor sarcastically tells him that she's gonna have him wash dishes. And Carter says (and honestly means it, this isn't said sarcastically,:) Oh wow, I am so lucky. Taylor then turns to Syd and says: Oh you got a real winner there. LOL!! So funny!! Meanwhile, Craig pays Nick to dig up proof that these 2 animals (Peter & Taylor, who else?) are enjoying their own s-e-x sessions!

Men Are From Melrose (Feb. 17, 1997)
This is one of my favorite eps, because it's all about the lewd behavior of Peter and Taylor! Nick is following them and witnesses everything! He even catches them on a golf course; talk about a hole in one! Carter and Syd breakup because he overhears her talking about him.

Frames 'R' Us (Feb. 24, 1997)
Nick is dropping hints to Taylor that he has proof. Later in the ep, Peter and Taylor pull off an elaborate s-c-a-m to s-t-e-a-l the pictures back! It was so funny when Taylor actually ripped her halter-top to make it look like Nick attacked her! After Kyle throws him out (BTW, how exactly is that possible since it isn't his building?) Nick records a secret conversation between Peter and Taylor. It was so dramatic when he called Craig and played the tape for him saying ""listen to the coming attractions."" The following morning, Craig and Amanda show up at Peter's condo because as Craig said to Amanda, ""I have to show you something."" And they see Peter and Taylor going at it like rabbits in heat! It was almost d-e-v-i-o-u-s watching Peter, because he looked up, made eye contact with Amanda, and then went back to his business without even flinching! OMG, so Melrose! I love it, I love it, I love it!!! You think that's good? Later on, Amanda shows up at ""Kyle's Restaurant"" unannounced and Taylor sarcastically says to her: Amanda, what can I do for you? Amanda then s-u-c-k-e-r-punches her in the face, with a big, closed, fist!!!! It cannot get better than this!! This is just as good as Crystal Carrington and Alexis Colby!!!!!!!!! Oh before I forget, as the ep ends, Amanda, in a drunken stupor, decides to have s-ex- with Craig. Dare I say, the girl could do much worse? Roll on big-mama!

Screams From a Marriage (March 3, 1997)
This' another favorite of mine!! Amanda wants nothing further to do with Peter (or Craig, for that matter.) Meanwhile, things are just as salacious for the McBride's when jar-head Kyle starts putting 2 & 2 together. He goes to visit Nick who reluctantly plays the tape of Taylor & Peter's little chit-chat session. Kyle then goes berserk, smashes the tape player, and punches Nick in the face. (Keep in mind, during Season 7 Kyle goes waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off the deep end (not unlike Kimberly) so this may just be a prelude of what's in store, 2 years later!) ... Anyway, later on in the ep, Kyle packs up Taylor's things and throws her out. OK, this is my favorite scene in the Entire History of ""Melrose"" ~ After being thrown out, Taylor takes her cute little designer suitcase and starts walking through the courtyard to leave. En route to the building exit (you know right where the mailboxes are, through the archway, but before those 2 double-doors,) who should show up, but Amanda! YES, YES, YES!!!! Amanda says to her: Taking a trip, somewhere? So sorry to see you go. Taylor: Your husband's condo, actually!! OK, this is even better than the punch in the face!!! I love it!!! Amanda retorts: Well good for you, all you had to do was break up 2 marriages. But who's counting. (BTW, Amanda's ""comeback"" was nowhere near as good as Taylor's remark.)

101 Damnations (March 10, 1997)
After returning to the streets, Michael takes Megan back. ...Amanda and Kyle also learn of Peter & Taylor's familial background. Kyle also confronts Taylor, grabbing her arm in a somewhat abusive way. Peter comes running out saying: take your hands off her. Kyle: I just wanted to hear it straight from the horses, I mean hore's mouth!! Later on, Matt has problems to deal with when his troublesome niece, Chelsea, is left in his care. BORING! (Why couldn't they have kept with the Dan storyline for Matt? Oh wait, I know why, the honchos at Fox were way too h-o-m-o-phobic for any really good stories for Matt.)

From Here to Maternity (March 17, 1997)
Syd tries to negotiate with Hilda's lawyer who only has dollar signs in his eyes. In perhaps her only smart-remark ever, Samantha says to Sydney: just for the record, I hope Hilda cleans your clock. Who's Hilda? She's this cute redhead who comes to Syd's boutique. I love how Sydney says to her, ""just so you know we don't have a very large selection of sizes"" (emphasis on the word ""large."") And Hilda then takes a nasty spill. Poor Hildegard!

Last Exit to Ohio (March 31, 1997)
Everyone's favorite mother-in-law, Marion Shaw (Janet Carroll) resurfaces to take Kimberly home. Get a load of the dinner between Kimberly, Marion, Michael and Megan. Does anyone else find that incredibly inappropriate? Anyway, this is a very sad ep, Kimberly is gone. Kimberly is no more. In honor of Kimberly's death I have a little song: Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old Witch? The Wicked Witch! Ding Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead. Wake up - sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed. Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead. She's gone where the goblins go, below - Below - below. Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out. Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low. Let them know The Wicked Witch is dead! (P.S. feel free replace the word ""witch"" with that word that starts with a capital ""B"" I'm sure you know which one!)

The Dead Wives Club (April 7, 1997)
Oh, before I forget, lemme tell you that Syd looses all of her assets to Hilda (this actually happened in the prior ep, but I was so enamored with Kimberly's situation that I plumb forgot about it.) I loved how Hilda was dramatically dressed in that ludicrous-looking neck-brace. The poor-thing was even in a wheel chair, too. Hilda makes herself fall down a flight of concrete stairs (making it look like Syd pushed her, remember Hilda was an old stunt girl.) Their presiding judge (where'd he come from, remember, this little stunt took place outside?) just so happens to witness this & everyone's holed back into court. (I sure bet if Syd set up a private liaison with perhaps Billy or Jake or even timid Matt, Hildegard would have dropped her bogus suit!) OK, on this ep, Syd finally decides to go to ""work for Harry"" (Markus Flanagan,) Hilda's unscrupulous lawyer; and she throws herself down Amanda's steps at a cocktail party she was hosting in honor of Kyle.

Deja Vu All Over Again (April 14, 1997)
Sydney is hurt worse than she thought she'd be. Harry advises her to keep her distance from Amanda and Craig, who tells Amanda that he will try to seduce Syd into dropping the suit. Later on, Kyle and Amanda discuss opening up a jazz club. Meanwhile, Michael's little sis Jennifer shows up unannounced. Michael gets her an interview at D&D because as he puts it ""Amanda owes me one"" (what exactly could Amanda ""owe"" Michael for??) Anyway, during the interview, Jennifer's behavior was beyond rude. Truth be told, I have never witnessed such a rude display of bad manners in my entire life. However, as the Season progresses, we all see the real Jennifer; she's a very sweet girl, that's a little rough around the edges; but very likable.

All Beths Are Off (April 14, 1997)
Jennifer bumps into Kyle at his restaurant and gives him a slap then runs off. It's later revealed that she was the girl who he had the affair with back in Boston! Michael-the-jack! ss throws his sister out, after that incident. Meanwhile, Allison (the other jack! ss) is hitting the bottle again. Her drinking gets so out-of-control that Amanda fires her (what is this like the 10th time she's been fired?) Also, Craig and Sydney get closer and this long-time viewer is elated to see that Syd is finally (getting) satisfied!

Ultimatums and the Single Guy (April 28, 1997)
The McBride's & Burns' discuss divorce at the restaurant. Taylor's taking to wearing some new ultra-conservative attire to peak her new live-in-lover's interest. I love when Amanda says to Taylor that her clothes are ""ugly."" It reminds me of the Season 6 ep, when on her wedding day (actually wedding evening) Taylor shows up unannounced and says to Amanda: Oh, by the way, your dress is hideous! Also in this ep, Syd starts working as a ""consultant"" at D&D. I love how Craig fights for his lady's honor and gets Harry to bug off!

Going Places (May 5, 1997)
With Michael's help, Taylor schemes to drug Peter and convince him that he has ""rage epilepsy."" It was so sick when Taylor egged Michael on to punch her so Peter would think she was really hurt! And then after she hits herself, did you see how she crawled up to Peter and starts kissing him. What a total deranged kook!

Secrets and Lies and More Lies (May 12, 1997)
Sydney undermines Amanda every chance she gets at D&D. Meanwhile, the Jazz club opens. And after seeing that Jennifer's working for Kyle, Amanda pushes him away. At the grand opening, Amanda throws herself onto Craig to make Syd jealous. This was done after Syd sarcastically said to Amanda: it's so sad watching the old lioness lose her teeth. (Another great line!)

Who's Afraid of Amanda Woodward? (May 12, 1997)
Note: this is a 2-part ep. In the first part, Syd and Craig decide to leave D&D and take all of Amanda's clients and employees with them! (I love Sydney but what makes her think that she's any match for Amanda in the business dept.?) When her assets are undermined, Amanda tries to back out of the jazz club deal. Meanwhile, Michael gets Taylor to make a spectacle out of herself so that Peter will cause a scene and Megan will report the ""abuse"" to Shulman. Later on, never-happy Allison stages a little show for Jake; she gets drunk with a friend so she can chase Jake away because the woman is never happy because she doesn't want to be happy! Good Riddance, Allison! You will not be missed! ...In the second part of the ep, Amanda suffers a breakdown over her agency. Jake gets his son and Colleen to move with him to Ojai. (It's sad that he's gone, but I am happy that at least Jake finally found happiness and was finally reunited with his son after all those years.) Peter realizes that Michael was behind his fall and attacks him at the office. Sydney finally finds love. She finally finds a man who will accept her for who she is. This is one of my favorite times for her, because in the 5 years that she was on the show she never really found unconditional love until she met Craig. It was very bittersweet when she was plowed down in her wedding dress, right after getting married!

Season 5 is the defining season of the trashiest, sleaziest, sexiest series that popularized (and polarized) casual affairs with multiple sex-partners! ""Melrose"" totally reminds me of Ms. Charly McClain's signature song: Who's cheatin' who an' who's bein' true? Who don't even care anymore...! That's so Melrose...!",1228089600,8,26914,4.640713536201469

I miss the 90s because today we are flooded with reality TV no good scripted dramas like these from the late Aaron Spelling.",1459036800,2,276,4.8936170212765955

8318427,3,B001LM64UG,"I watched every episode of course, as Beverly Hills 90210 was my favorite TV show! The acting is not good, the story lines predictable and unbelievable, but still a 90's classic that is loved by many, I won't watch the series again as I would watch reruns of 90210 any and every time, but different strokes for different folks I guess....",1441152000,,338,4.557377049180328
