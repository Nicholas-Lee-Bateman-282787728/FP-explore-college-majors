1981184,5,B0001971R0,"This movie won the 1984 French equilivant to the Oscar for best picture and deserves to be seen!
The Beta copy I just saw this evening had me laughing and smiling at the situations created by these two policemen working their Paris beat. Having known several policemen and hearing their stories - none of this is far fetched at all. An excellent story, well acted, and a steady pace of action suspended real time as I followed the change in the 'freshman' cop straight from the academy. His experienced partner definitely had his routines upset but the two did find a common ground and began to enjoy working with each other.
Although the Beta tape I saw this evening was subtitled - none of the humor was lost and was easy to read. The tape is old and starting to deteriorate in the beginning -- don't let this movie (the original inspiration for the American cop and rookie/bad guy movies in the 80s-90s)fade away! Bring it out on DVD, please!!",1086220800,3,946,4.570588235294117
1981185,5,B0001971R0,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've had it so long that I own it on Beta!
The story: a veteran ""flic"" (Paris cop) teaches his new partner all the tricks of the cop's trade -- and a few other tricks as well. The new partner, by-the-book and wet behind the ears, finds out why he has to toss the book out the window.
The development of their friendship and their romances with the ""professional"" women they love is amusing throughout and the movie turns out to be heartwarming at the end, as well.
This movie turned me into a BIG fan of Philippe Noiret's, but the rookie, Thierry Lhermitte, the actress who plays his Russian girlfriend (I couldn't find her name), and the legendary Regine, as the veteran's girlfriend, are all first rate and unforgettable. Lhermitte deserves particular applause for his slap-stick straightman portrayal of the new partner.",1075334400,,870,4.69281045751634
8008433,5,B0001971R0,"I first saw this movie when it first came to America back in the early 80's is when it came out.  It was one of my first French movies and one of my first foreign film movies.  I fell in love with foreign flicks after this movie.  Great flick.  I have tried to buy it several times, but could not find a subtitled version.  Now I have it and have watched several times since receiving it.",1523145600,,388,4.052631578947368

8008440,5,B0001971R0,"I had been looking for this rare movie for twenty years! Imagine my suprise when 'surfing' Ebay to come across a copy. I was quite prepared to have a long wait for delivery, after all, I had been looking for this film for twenty years. ""My New Partner"" is a French film made in 1985. The story revolves around a detective about to retire who is saddled with a 'rookie' who wants to do everything by the book and arrest any law breaker. This 'New Partner' creates many headaches for the poor old guy who does his best to educate the rookie. The climax comes, when the retiring detective plots to add to his pension income, in a very unusual twist at the end of the movie.",1231200000,,670,4.283464566929134
8008441,5,B0001971R0,"""Les Ripoux,"" here under the guise of ""My New Partner,"" does not break any new ground.  In fact, it abounds in cliches.  The virtue of this brilliant French comedy is not to be found in its innovation but in its perfection.  Actors Philippe Noiret, Thierry Lhermitte, Rgine, Grace De Capitani and director Claude Zidi take the moves right out of the standard playbook and execute them with exquisite grace and precision.

Noiret serves as the heart of the film.  Not since W. C. Fields has such an unmitigated reprobate been so hilariously portrayed.  He is not only a bent cop living the down-at-the-heels good life on the cuff, in his shaggy, baggy-eyed way, he is the Cary Grant of bent cops living the down-at-the-heels good life on the cuff.

The film deals with the fate of Noiret's raffish, crooked, Parisian Eden when a serpent enters into it.  The serpent is a young, intense and, alas, deplorably honest cop who becomes Noiret's new partner.

The best parts of the film are the sly attempts of the older man, who makes it a point of honor not to arrest anybody, to corrupt the youthful straight arrow.  The third act of the movie is by turns a bit too melodramatic and than too sentimental, but that is of no consequence.  What you will remember is the continually evolving relationship of the two men.

They are skillfully aided by the presence of two fine actresses, Rgine and Grace di Capitani as courtesans--in the best sense of the word--at differing stages of their respective careers.

This is a genuine winner.  Why it has not been issued in DVD form for North America is a mystery to me.

Five stars, but of course.",1186790400,,1634,4.644599303135888
8008442,5,B0001971R0,"Some films become dated, some lose their humor, and then there are others that are just as wonderful to watch as the day they were released.
This is one of those films.  The story sounds straightforeward.  A currupt cop at the start of the movie is seen getting his partner to take the fall for some of their above the law scams.  He is rewarded for this by recieving a new partner.  Theirry Lhermitte, a recent graduate from the acadamy who is very by the book and straight laced,  How the two partners affect each other and the women in their lives is an enjoyable story, but the side jokes in this French farce will have your stomache hurting, whether it is the older police officer giving his boss a special nasal spray to help with his hayfever ""Mixed with cocaine from a drug bust"" or setting up the younger straightlaced policeman with a woman who turns out to be a prostitute and then becoming surprised when they actually fall for each other, this movie will keep you laughing all the way up to its...dare I say it?  Decidedly un-French optimistic ending.  This movie is not out on DVD, and it was one of the reasons I waited so long to get rid of my VCR player.  Nobody could watch this film and not finish in a cheerful mood.",1086825600,3,1236,4.366812227074236
