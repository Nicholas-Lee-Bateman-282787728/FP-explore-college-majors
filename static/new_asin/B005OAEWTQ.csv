4851665,3,B005OAEWTQ,"I thought I was buying a DVD replacement for my VHS version of Walt Disney's ""The African Lion"".  I should have read the product description more carefully.  This film is actually a series of videos that are roughly an hour long, with considerable attention paid to other species that share territory with lions.  There is also considerable ""sharing"" of video; example: the same shot of a maneless lion rushing a herd of wildebeests is used to illustrate a lioness having difficulty feeding her cubs, an adolescent lion learning to hunt for himself, and a random lion failing to make a kill (which happens quite often, we are told).  This is an okay film, but it is NOT the Disney masterpiece.",1404950400,3,693,4.75
4851666,4,B005OAEWTQ,"Lion awesomeness done with a the typical flat British narration, but still worth watching. Good documentaries well worth the price you won't be disappointed. Some if the older films took me back to thinking of watching wild kingdom with my grandad. Good material on lions doesn't gloss over too much of the harshness of life probably a result of it being British had Discovery channel done the Zebras and Lions would have skipped into the sunset at the end",1398729600,2,456,4.784810126582278
4851667,2,B005OAEWTQ,"It's ok.
It seems one filming was recycled into 4 dvds.
Picture is eh, ok at best.
Of 8 dvds, I would say 3 of them are decent.....The other 5 are pretty much a waste.",1388016000,4,167,3.8
4851668,5,B005OAEWTQ,Wow! This is a REAL DEAL! This offering contains a good number of complete African Lion films in a nice collector box for a very modest price.,1378771200,,142,4.296296296296297
4851669,5,B005OAEWTQ,"This is a box set of 10 dvds and because I love lions, I love this set.  I just ordered it and already I've watched 6 or 7.  At a point on the Lions and Hyenas dvd in this set something is shared about hyenas that's never been shared before and has changed my whole outlook on hyenas because before watching this dvd, I did not like them - no spoiler over here! If you're a true lion lover, you will enjoy this addition to your collection.  Also, if you're a true lion lover then you've seen a lot of what's out there.  What I love best about this set is at least 98% of the footage has never before been seen, which made this an excellent purchase.  This set is put together very nicely.  Inside the packaging shown is two nice sized dvd jackets with 5 dvds each inside.  I had bought ""Lions - Deluxe Box Set"" along with this set which is a 4 dvd set but I returned it because those 4 were inclusive of this 10 dvd set.",1371513600,9,920,4.021978021978022
4851670,2,B005OAEWTQ,"The service was prompt and efficient, but the content of the DVD is quite poor. It appears to be recycled and repackaged older footage from 1999. In the days of BBC quality of photography this leaves much to be desired. Also, what's with this old shirtless man walking around, talking and taking a shower naked? My interest is primarily the animals, not people talking and wasting time.  So much more could be done with the life of lions themselves. Also, this outer box where it is packaged is such a waste as it cannot fit in any standard DVD  library. It appears to be ""amateurish"". Sorry, although the price is good, I am disappointed.",1357084800,9,639,4.5964912280701755
4851671,4,B005OAEWTQ,"While some of the newer BBC films are unbeatable, this set is certainly worth the investment. I was pleasantly surprised. There are eight discs and they are separated into two groups of four films.

From the first set here are my rankings:

4 Dangerous Companions- Interesting but more of an educational documentary about zoologist Kevin Richardson and his work with lions and hyenas.
3 Lions and Hyenas- A good look at hyenas with a some lions mixed in.
2- Monkey Hunters- Again with lions mixed in, but a great look at baboons if you love them like I do. Great footage on this one.
1- The African King- In my opinion, this one is the best of the entire set with excellent close ups and sound.

From the second set:
4- Lord of the Lions- Educational and more about George Adamson.
3-Taranyre- More about location, lots of other animals featured though.
2- The Lioness- The shortest but still a moving film about the role of the female.
1- Lions of the...- Great look at the pride.

Packaging and film quality is great.",1325376000,36,1019,4.582417582417582

4851677,2,B005OAEWTQ,Take one of the DVD's and call it pretty good.  Take the balance and recognize that a good portion of the material seems to have been just edited in from other 'Lion' DVD's already published under different names.  This was so true for 1 of the DVD's that I actually had to check and see if they had put 2 copies of the same one in by mistake.  I'm still not positive that isn't what they did.,1420243200,3,393,4.077922077922078

4851681,5,B005OAEWTQ,These were good nature films.  I supposed this would be a single DVD but it was a package of 8 discs playing approximately 50 minutes.  I enjoyed watching them.,1405728000,,160,4.482758620689655

8481070,1,B005OAEWTQ,Old footage. I have watched 2 DVDs so far and have only seen about 10 minutes of lion footage. The rest has been all about baboons and hyenas. Lesson learned. I'm going to stick with National Geographic. Probably not even going to finish watching the rest of them.,1473033600,,264,4.520833333333333

8481073,4,B005OAEWTQ,"We used it to set an African theme in a den on a new, large HD tv.  It was great for that purpose, but be forewarned--it does show lions taking down and consuming their prey, and is probably too intense for young kids and the unsuspecting.  Preview before sharing.",1461196800,,264,4.36734693877551
