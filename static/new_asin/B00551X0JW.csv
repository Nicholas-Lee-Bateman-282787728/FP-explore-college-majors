8457306,5,B00551X0JW,"What a unique and unusual film. Wow! They filmed a Native American wandering around NYC before, during and after 9/11 but the cool angle of the director is he shot it with a silent film era camera. Your sense of time is blurred. Events of the recent past seem to be surreal and maybe they are. I noticed it won the Tribeca Film Festival best documentary award and it makes sense. In a nutshell, this film captures the festival's mission to rise from the ashes and become revitalized. I won't give away the ending only to say moving from black & white film to color is symbolic of moving from a dream state to reality. Who knew that these cameras took color film back in the 20s. It just wasn't invented yet!",1416873600,,707,4.363636363636363
