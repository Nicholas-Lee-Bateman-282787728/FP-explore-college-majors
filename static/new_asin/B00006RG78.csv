1787672,5,B00006RG78,"You have never seen a movie like The Fast Runner. You've likely avoided movies like The Fast Runner, but it would be an injustice to avoid this masterpiece of cinema art. There's no other way to refer to this unique film. Visually it showers the viewer with images never before seen in a movie, never even imagined. Surreal sunsets, rippling vistas of snow that look like the ocean, amazing faces, bizarre rituals, ancient tools, instructions on building an ice house, and more shades of white than you ever knew existed. If this were a documentary on a three-thousand-year old culture, it could not have been more well-researched and faithful to the smallest details.
Be prepared for what is initially a confusing and slow experience in storytelling. The faces look alike, and the family relationships are not immediately easy to grasp, made even more confusing by the leaps in time at the beginning. But take your time and let the story come to you. It's worth it. It all makes sense eventually. This is an ancient story of evil corrupting man and the eradication of evil through love and forgiveness; a love story of jealousy, revenge, survival, tragedy and finally, justice and redemption. The characters become like personal friends before the film is over, as we are completey caught up in the complex nature of the relationships.
There is a reason stories like these survive for thousands of years, because there is so much universal truth inherent in them that they always have something to teach us, despite what at first seems so alien. We recognize ourselves in these people. The utterly simple, straightforward and honest style of storytelling here, in the final analysis, overleaps the boundaries of language and race.
And for a really cool finale, during the closing credits we see behind-the-scenes footage of the actors and crew in their leather jackets and walkmans joking around with each other, working the equipment, and shivering in the snow, just like we would be doing, reminding us how little distance there really is from there to here.",1044921600,6,2061,4.959537572254336
1787673,5,B00006RG78,"""Atanarjuat - The Fast Runner,"" the first-ever film done entirely in the Inuit language, is a three-hour-long epic, ultimately rewarding if you're willing to indulge in it. Done on digital video and filmed by actors from the native tribe near regions of the Arctic, the filmmakers capture images onscreen that were impossible to do before this technology became available. Because digital video doesn't use tape that wouldn't have survived the harsh temperatures of the region, we are able to see things like a group of Inuits on the hunt or a man running completely naked across entirely frozen regions of land. For that alone, the film is fascinating, a landmark in film history.
The story the film portrays, though, is equally as compelling, for it's a tragedy as twisty as anything Shakespeare wrote. Set in a time shortly after the Ice Age, it tells a story that has passed down as folklore.
A tribe becomes infected by evil when a curse hits them. The ruling family of the tribe is particularly corrupt. One member of the tribe, though not a great hunter himself, has two sons of promise, and, when the two grow into men, they hold the fate of the tribe in their hands.
Atanarjuat, the younger son who grows into the fastest runner and best hunter in the tribe, is the object of envy and scorn from the son of the ruling family. Atanarjuat's even in love with that son's intended bride, whom he wins after a tribal duel. Resentment grows within the ruling family as a result of this. And Puta, the daughter from the ruling family, is also in love with Atanarjuat, and she's capable of schemes and machinations.
As time passes, trouble brews, and ""Atanarjuat"" becomes a sort of Eskimo ""Melrose Place."" (You're not going to BELIEVE how Puta tries to commit adultery with one brother while the other's sleeping next to her in the same teepee. That was one of the best scenes I saw last year.) It's always compelling, and it works as effective soap opera. But the ambition surrounding the film makes it far greater than that.
Though I don't speak Inuit and likely will never see another Inuit film, I feel as though this was well-acted, well-written and a labor of love for all involved in its making. (The difficulty of the filming is exhibited over the film's end credits, showing how exactly ""Atanarjuat"" was done.)
It's an interesting, important film, compelling because of its story and significant because it even exists.",1044230400,22,2429,4.771971496437055

1787773,5,B00006RG78,"This is an excellent movie about the people who occupy some of the remotest wilderness in the climate of the far North. For a low budget production it is remarkably well presented. It has a good story line, and the cinematography is good. The technology looks very much like video, but the story is intriguing. I liked it because it is representative of how people live in such a inhospitable climate. Indeed, it is spectacular. It is a story about survival, family, individual competition and even a little regulation nudity. All these things combine to make an interesting viewing experience.",1372723200,,594,4.95

I was reminded of growing up in Ontario, cold winters, going north to winter camps, the feeling of strength in the people. The no nonsense attitude to life. I liked the film for many reasons, primarily because it was made with Native actors, with consideration for the culture being portrayed, and focus on a story that was rich in the telling of the culture not only the story points the filmmakers wanted to communicate to the audience.

1787798,4,B00006RG78,"An epic story of sex/lust/murdering is unfolded in the far north of Canada, in a timeless freeze-bitten location where natives' every step is a fight to simply survive physically.

I feel this work somehow teaming with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Canoes/dp/B000S8CLSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Canoes</a>"":  no wonder, folks differ for ethnics and customs as human nature is the same wherever.",1334793600,,783,7.775280898876405
1787799,3,B00006RG78,"It's two hours and forty minutes long, folks.

I would say the first hour is not so good:  it's confusing and the most outstanding thing is that it's filmed on video.  Sure, it may have all Innu actors and crew and so forth, but that doesn't mean it's any good.  During the first hour, you're gonna start thinking it was a slog.  But hang in there.  After all, this filmed was considered by the Toronto International Film Festival to be one ""Canada's Top Ten Films of All Time"" (in 2004).

The second hour or so is well worth it.  There's a gripping chase scene and the plot is brought together nicely.

Here are some reasons while I feel this film is worth sitting through:

1.  Interesting to see a culture acting out a mythic story of their own distant past.
2.  Interesting to see that, even in modern-day Canada, there are some people in serious need of dental work.
3.  Interesting to see that, even in societies where women are often regarded as having secondary status, they hold the ultimate trump card.

Not that I agree with the judgment of the Toronto International Film Festival, but it is nice to see an Eskimo movie whose principal theme isn't ""all of our problems have been brought on by Whitie.""",1328140800,2,1212,4.5
1787800,5,B00006RG78,"I bought this years ago when it was released.  It is still among my favorites, so unique, quite out of place in the general films released to the buyers.

Most viewers would be startled to go back a thousand years and far into the arctic.  A world few modern city folks would understand.

I like the pace and the great effort to show pre-european life.

I wish we viewers were treated to a caribou hunt, a walrus hunt, fishing, but those events would have been added production expense and time.  More of the ancient life would be welcome.

We modern people are very seldom in touch with our real and ancient past.  Ice Age life in Europe comes to mind as well as post Ice Age time.

We need to be reminded of this past and there are a few films out there but nothing so carefully done as this film.

Of course, there are some folks who cannot make the thoughtful and emotional journey to our deep past.  Such people have hearts more frozen than arctic ice perhaps?

Common human life we know here and now is in this film.  A lesson to us if we care to see it.  Vanity is vanity no matter where or when or why.  Tragedy is the usual result of such self interest.  Consideration for others is still difficult for us.",1325980800,2,1215,4.2631578947368425
1787801,5,B00006RG78,"From a Inuit legend about Fast Runner, named Atanarjuat, a young man who wants Atuat.  But she has been promised to Oki, son of the leader.  Atuat decides to become Atanarjuat's wife, of her own free will, which at first seems to work well.  But Oki is jealous and anger and allows his feelings to take over.  What follows is pain and death.
The film is simple and feels like somebody's homevideo.  But a well made one, full of scenes from daily life - family life, tribal life, hunting, loving, the relationships between wife and husband, brother and brother, parents and children.  Survivial in a different culture.  Yet somehow still understandable.
These are adult themes, filmed in the harsh landscape of the North - snow and ice as far as you can see or run.  Not for kids or people who are easily bored.  I loved the film because I love dog sleds and Inuit stories and survival in winter climates.  It hooked me and kept my interest the whole two plus hours.  It made me want to drink hot coco and sleep by a warm fire - but for me that's a good thing.  It made me react to it.
If you read the other reviews you will notice either people hate it or love it.  In the end, I don't think there are any reasons why people love it or hate it.  It just depends on your interests.

1787828,5,B00006RG78,"Fast Runner (Atanarjuat) is one of the greatest movies made. Period. Yet it is a shame that such a gem is a victim of cultural and corporate marginalization. It's a small budget film from the edges of Canadian cinema. There are no white actors in Atanarjuat, so cultural racism is also a reason few have seen it. I was lucky enough to see it in a theatre when it first came out - it played for a few weeks at one or two cinemas in Montreal where I live, then disappeared. Some films must be seen in a theatre with a big screen and full sound system - films that have great visuals and sound. This is one.

Antanarjuat has all the features of a great movie: transcendental script of the human condition employing novelty, humor, morality and tragedy; fantastic cinematography of the Artic; terrific acting; absorbing characters; and creative sound. I still remember the breathing of the naked runner in the frozen snow.

If you see Antanarjuat on a dvd, use a big screen and crank up the sound. Enjoy.",1242950400,5,1000,4.519337016574585
1787829,4,B00006RG78,"this movie was kind of slow paced, but once you kind of set yourself to that pace, it was pretty good. i think at one point they said the story is pretty universal among the inuit, in the credits or the 'how it was made' part. it's basically about this guy named atanarjuat, the fast runner, and it takes us through his life. the way it's told, now that i look back on it, has many of the same aspects as some of the less fantastical legends i've heard. the plot had a kind of 'epic' feel to it i guess.

it was a very... real movie. there was no hollywood drama or special effects, you felt like you were right there with them. it was a fascinating look at inuit life and culture, and was pretty well done.",1221782400,,707,4.086330935251799

Let's not forget that Canada does not call its aboriginal peoples American (Canadian) Indians or Native Americans (Canadians), rather the PC numbingly (& ultimately meaningless) First Nations; although the increasing evidence that these `First Nations' actually conquered & slaughtered the actual 1st Americans (represented by Kennewick Man & similar archaeological findings) will doubtlessly lead to an even more meaningless appellation in a decade or 2. Accordingly, the Eskimo culture has been re-termed Inuit, after 1 of several languages spoken in the Canadian Arctic- a bit of Inuit cultural imperialism, eh? I don't play those games- I'll call an Eskimo an Eskimo- a term derived from yet another Native lingo. Do I call myself a gringo because Mexicans do? Do I say I live in the EU (Estados Unidos) because a Spaniard would associate that acronym with the USA, rather than the European Union? Did we call the USSR the CCCP? Of course not- to hell with semantics!....
The characters are utterly clueless of any depth to life, the director has no sense of narrative nor editing skills, nor any ability to transcend stereotypes (just compare this dreck to the delightful Native American comedy of a few years back- Smoke Signals- with a strong script & well-developed characters by Sherman Alexie), the visuals are poorly constructed & dull, & the score is predictably laced with mind-numbingly obvious chants & gutturals.
  While not the worst film I've ever seen, given its indie-artsy buildup (generally more credible than flat-out Hollywood Oscar buzz), I have to term Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner the most disappointing film in a very long time. About the only positive thing about Eskimo culture that can be discerned from this film is that they will not have to be subjected to it- at least not for a few more centuries!",1220745600,,2025,4.9705014749262535
1787831,5,B00006RG78,"Forget its awards and honours, the Camera d'or from Cannes and that raft of Genies and a bagful of other festival citations. For now, there are only three things you need to know about Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner: (1) It is a superb film; (2) It is both intriguingly exotic and uniquely Canadian; (3) Although based on an ancient myth, and set on a distant shore a thousand years ago, it speaks eloquent volumes about the way we live now. The abiding myths are like that, of course, but few movies have managed to harness their timeless power -- this movie does.

The setting is the far north, that white expanse embedded in today's consciousness as a totem of all that's virginal and solitary and silent, a romantic escape from the hubbub of modernity.

Well, think again. Even at the dawn of the first millennium, the Inuit lived there, and they lived through a matrix of social and political tensions that will seem hauntingly familiar -- tensions that the subsequent centuries of apparent advances and creature comforts have done nothing to change or resolve.

This enduring dialectic is the subject of the re-enacted myth. Actually, the filmmakers prefer the term ""relived,"" and with good reason. That's because, shooting on location with native actors talking in the Inuktitut language, director Zacharias Kunuk has contrived simultaneously to give the picture the realistic look of a documentary and the dream-like feel of a fable. So we're plunged directly into the daily minutiae of this other world -- its frozen geography and its igloo dwellings, its food and utensils and weapons and clothing, its little jokes and its chronic rigours. However, as the narrative gathers momentum, as the myth unfolds, its themes seep out of the recreated past and into our smug present.

Consequently, viewers are treated to an extraordinary experience, a sort of double vision. Stylistically, the film blends the anthropological with the epic -- Nanook of the North with Ran.

Substantively, there's an identical fusion of the then-and-there with the here-and-now -- we seem to be inside this ancient realm looking outward at our own existence, and being struck as much by the similarities as the differences.

Certainly, the story's initial note will ring a bell. The first sequence depicts the fall of this icy Eden. If the opening appears a bit confusing, even disorienting, so be it -- what can be more perplexing than original sin? Or as the script (by the late Paul Apak Angilirq) puts it: ""Evil came to us like death -- we never knew how it happened."" Yes, evil -- a word that isn't exactly underemployed these days; and a concept that the myths of religion were invented to explain, and to control.

This myth is no exception: How to deal with evil, and the terror it spreads, is our topic (our very current affair) for the next two hours and 52 minutes. Not surprisingly, the time races by.

Indeed, as the story-line develops, classical and Christian scholars will easily recognize their favourite tropes -- like patricide; like brotherly enmity; like scarlet women and jealous wives and murderous villains and sacred animals; like the wounded hero who is exiled on a long journey, yet fated to return to cleanse the kingdom of its hatred and restore the souls of its sinners.

Here he's known as Atanarjuat; other cultures might call him the Fisher King; still others would crown him with thorns.

However -- and this is crucial to the movie's hold on us -- all of these symbolic figures and patterns are dramatized with the utmost realism.

The picture is mythic in content but never in presentation. These people aren't just icons in an old saga; they're living, breathing folks who belch and break wind, who giggle and flirt, who strut and posture and, between bites from a caribou steak, sing bawdy songs that embrace timely truths. (Sample lyric: ""Even a big man can't bring home enough food/ If what's hanging between his legs gets too stiff."")

This brand of realism is no accident. Instead, it's the long-practised method of Kunuk and his cinematographer Norman Cohn, who share an extensive background in video art, the slow-paced kind that emphasizes watching over telling. Alternating from sweeping panoramas to stark close-ups, from hunters mushing a sled over crevassed ice to a woman's gnarled hand holding a bone needle, their camera is keenly observant to both sights and sounds. It hears rhythms in the winter at its harshest (the incessant crack of footfalls on rock-hard snow); it sees beauty when the seasons change and the harshness briefly relents (a lone kayaker paddling over still waters glinting in the midnight sun).

That's not to say these guys can't shift into a kinetic gear when action is called. In fact, they have the skill to animate cinematic clichs. There's a chase sequence here that's as good as any I've seen in a decade. And there's a ritualistic punch-up, black and bruised, that puts any studio western to shame. Also, as with every paradise-lost myth, the violence is paired with an ample helping of sex -- sometimes brutish, often loving and, on more than one occasion, wonderfully erotic.

Naturally, a film with such a broad range demands a lot from its actors. They respond impeccably, professionals and amateurs alike. Natar Ungalaaq in the heroic title role, Pakkak Innukshuk as the resident villain, are both playing nicely rounded characters -- the one has his flaws, the other has his merits, and the performances reflect these duelling sides of the moral equation. With her flashing smile, Lucy Tulugarjuk is a delightfully designing woman, the kind of born drama queen who can somehow make even the most selfish act seem ingenuous. Finally, poignantly, Sylvia Ivalu weeps real tears as the beleaguered wife, streaming rivulets that bisect the tattooed lines on her swollen cheeks.

Too often, our Western response to aboriginal culture carries a strong whiff of the sentimental, of the patronizing and the politically correct. But Atanarjuat steadfastly resists that. Rather, it demands both to be heard in its own voice and to be appreciated on its own terms -- not as a quaint native artifact, but as a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film.

That pertinence is no more apparent than during the resolution, where the myth offers up its answer to the troubling riddle of evil. Only when the Fast Runnner slows down can he reach, and understand, his epiphany. Significantly, it comes before the practical matters -- and this is a practical society -- of meting out punishment and tempering justice with mercy. More important still, it comes from a man wielding power at the business end of a knife, and it wells up as a cry from the depths of his anguished heart. Bold, brave, direct, decisive, the cry doubles as an assertion, cutting through the clamour of the centuries and their cycles of violence, cutting through all the unholy dins in all the holy lands. Shouted in an ancient tongue, his four words speak to every age, none more forcibly than our own: ""THE KILLING STOPS HERE."" Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216598400,,7100,4.928870292887029

Its epic sweep ia as far removed from Campbell's directorial acolyte, George Lucas, as one could imagine. Not its story content,which Campbell well knew, but in its touch of authentic telling. Its mythic narrative has no resemblance to,'The Ring','Harry Potter' and their ilk. It bursts spontaneously upon its audience, free from Hollywood, box-office self-consciousness, endowed with scale, patience, pace and nuance of place, and NO pedantry. The camera takes us us up close, smelling, in touching reach of fur, flesh, piss and blood, the fumes of arctic life, and by contrasting these with the vast and barren surrounds, speaks eloquently of how this country impacts on these people, and how such myths came into being and continue their relevance. In this context, the struggle of adultery, revenge and shamanistic powers glove together seamlessly, explicably, but without a trace of moral grandstanding. It's a superb model for film-makers, a brilliant piece for jaded viewers, and probably impossible to conceive, even granted a wish to emulate(artistic envy) stirred in the hearts of Hollywood filmakers.",1161993600,5,1223,5.51063829787234

In fact, this is one of the most visually striking movies I have ever watched.  Many scenes are world-class, and a few are among the most remarkable ever recorded: not just the arctic scenery, which is strange and sublime, but the igloo interiors, the now-famous run accross the ice, the many lingering close-ups in which no acting is evident, the low sun seen through and off of snow... Suspend disbelief and watch this movie.

Beyond the visuals, I have to say that the acting, which achieves a very enviable transparency and un-self-conscious immediacy, drew me to these characters like no other movie since Derzu Uzala.  When the screen went black at the end I felt truly disoriented, as though stepping from one universe to another.  The movie is utterly transporting.  Hardly a moment wasn't completely convincing.

I rented it and after 15 minutes I had no idea who was who in the movie.  The film is not a film at all, but a work shot on prosumer video equipment in the middle of some icy nowhere.  I thought he had just played a joke on me.

Yet at the end of the movie I was speechless.  Other reviewers have talked about the content.  What amazes me is how much this filmmaker did with so little.  I mean, this is Art with a capital A.  Every filmmaker who thinks they can't do a film without the best equipment should watch this film.  I'd put this film in my top 100 easily (no matter what the technology used).

I was reluctant to put 3 hours aside to watch this movie.  I was ready to turn it off after 15 minutes.  But I didn't and I was rewarded in a way that helps explain why people went to the trouble to transcribe the Odyssy, Iliad and Bible for thousands of years.

One problem I am ashamed to admit, but I had a hard time telling who was who. I've never had that problem before with non-Caucasians. And the names being so foreign, names Westerners never heard of, made it more difficult. But I finally sorted them out. If I couldn't, I would have had to quit watching.

I also couldn't decide (and still haven't) if it was poor acting by some of the people in the film (they were all non-professional) or that I'm used to American extroverted nature and because of that, they sounded flat to my ears. Emotionless. Once the story picked up the pace, it was a good story and even the actors seemed more into it.

I liked seeing the tundra and watching how the Inuits lived. One scene they were having a religious ceremony and I couldn't help but think of Pentecostal Christians. I guess humans want to change how they feel and experience life. Some do it with drugs, booze and other possibly destructive means, and some people use prayer, meditation and other religious means (which when abused can be destructive too).

I didn't like how they showed them kicking the dog, and yes, they were actually abusing the animals. I understand that in different cultures what we consider pets other may not, but still, did they have to display that in the film? Couldn't they work around that where it's just implied?

This film isn't for everyone. People who like lots of action will be bored. And anyone under 18, unless they are mature, will become fidgety.

At 2hr & 45min I found every scene was essential to the story and invested with authentic daily activity. For the uninitiated this film will show you enough as it goes along to understand and relate, but different points might jump out at someone who shares in their knowledge. In scanning other people's reviews I noted some found it hard to grasp Native spirituality, whereas I guess, having read many Native tales, this made perfect sense to me. Here's three hints: 1)The guy in the beginning from up North with the creepy laugh is the physical representation of an evil spirit/curse. 2)Whenever you're in trouble you call out to your ancestors for help. 3)Sometimes a rabbit isn't really a rabbit.
I loved the attention to little details like, the talk of game being scarce and ""not fat enough"". This is a reference to the fact that the Inuit diet consists predominantly of meat and fat (blows your diet theories huh?); hence the mystical rabbit is very fat. This is due to a condition known in pioneer America as ""Rabbit Starvation"", which results from the fact that you can eat as much lean rabbit as you want and still starve to death. You must have a certain ratio of fat to meat to live off meat, and most rabbits are too lean to subsist on.
The images are just BEAUTIFUL! The acting is fantastic and will hook you. There's so many things I could say about this film, but none higher than; it made me reach a greater understanding of my Native roots.",1145664000,2,1578,4.559859154929577

1787874,5,B00006RG78,"The Fast Runner satisfies our need to be taken to faraway places and experience what life is like for people very different from ourselves.  With that said, we will not be surpised when we don't completely understand the motivation and behavior of the various characters in the story.  The Inuit people of the far north live in a harsh and desolate world.  Their survival depends on their ability to work cooperatively with one another for the good of the tribe.  To be cast out from the group is tantamount to a sentence of death.

For many of us in the United States spirit and nature are separate realities and we are uncomfortable when spirituality is spoken of as something real.  In The Fast Runner it is immediately apparent that the spirit is a living entity for the Inuit in this story and we are challenged to suspend our prejudices and disbelief and allow the story to unfold on its own terms, not ours.

For the Inuit, evil is not an abstract concept, but a living reality, and the tribe in our story must confront and overcome dark forces which threaten their survival.

Once we have let go of our prejudices, the long story of Atanarjuat's struggle to escape from the killers who murder his brother and chase him out of his camp over the frozen landscape makes sense.  Atanarjuat does escape from his persuers and hides with an elderly man, his wife, and daughter.  Atanarjuat, the fast runner, has injured his feet badly in his escape and needs time for his wounds to heal.  Eventually, he is ready to return to his wife and child and when the elderly man receives a spiritual summons, the group breaks camp and returns to confront the evil men who threaten to destroy the tribe.

When the DVD was over I went back and viewed it again to see what I had missed in my understanding of the story.  I replayed the introductory twenty minutes several times trying to force Inuit thinking and behaving into my logical American world view.

1787876,5,B00006RG78,"I saw this movie last night and made it all the way to bedtime without words. After having a chance to sleep on it, it is now starting to sink in how truly amazing this movie is. You will be first blown away by the fact that this movie even exists. It is truly unprecedented in every sense of the word. I don't remember seeing anything like it.  the only movie remotely close is ""Nanook of the North"", which is a huge stretch. Unlike ""Nanook"", this movie is shot from the Inuit perspective, by the Inuit themselves (90% of the participants in this production were full-blooded Inuit. This is a first), and the characters are not looked upon as anthropological specimens. They are real people living in a fragile existence, where any wrong move could mean sure death.

The actors are astonishing, and it must have been so terribly cold up there. You know this must have been a huge labor of love for the production team.  (According to the end credits, two crewmen died making this movie) The scenery is astonishing. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that exists on many different levels and subplots, etc. All told on the frozen tundra without ANY indication given about the timeframe, or even the century, in which it was set.

I am just astonished at the painstaking attention to historical detail. I have read many books on Inuit culture, and most everything I have read was visualized in this movie, the social structure, the power of the patriarch, the constant looming of starvation, the role of the hunter/husband, the insubordination of women (pre-arranged marriages), the obsession with taboo and curses, the fine art of building igloos and staying warm in -60 temps, and yet, through all the hardships, there was so much happiness. They even showed how the dogs were handled and treated, even down to the way the Inuit would slicken their sledge rails by spitting small amounts of water on them until a layer of slick frozen ice formed, which makes the sledges slide easier over the pack ice.

One aspect I noticed was how the movie was TOTALLY devoid of the influence of the white man. Their knives were made from caribou horns; they had no metal tools or metal cookware, which indicates that the movie was purposely based on a time before the Inuit's first contact with the white man.

It has a slow start, it's only fault. You will be a bit confused at first, trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening, but then it starts to really suck you in, you begin to love the protagonists, who are physically beautiful people, and then you will grow to hate the antagonists, who are mean and undesirable.  Afterwards, you will realize again that almost all of these people, cast and crew, were full-blooded Inuit. You will then want to immediately see it again and demand a documentary on the making of this film. You will want to know who these people are, what they do in their normal lives, because most of these actors are making their big screen debut. The end of the movie gives you a quick behind-the-scenes peek, but it serves as only a small appetizer to a bigger feast. Most importantly, your respect for their pride and perseverance of their culture will increase ten-fold.  This movie is worth owning and watching repeatedly and recommending it to a good friend or two.  I don't know the people who made this film, but I am proud of them for pulling this off, and doing it so astonishingly well.  There is nothing else like it.",1107388800,49,3482,4.637987012987013

There have been some great remarks about the ""nature shots"". What nature? Ice and snow do qualify I suppose, but let's face it, the frozen Arctic is no nature wonderland. So no kudos on that end either.

I gave this thing 2 stars because it was kinda neat, for the first 20 minutes at least, to see how life in an Inuit village was conducted in the old days...and perhaps today even.
Beyond that, there isn't anything that warrants the lavish praises bestowed upon this mess.
It's too long, too boring, too predictable, the acting too amateurish, the production too lacking in even the most rudamentary of styles and the characters too unattractive....as in every last one of them, to pass for a legitimate film.

The story is straight forward, but what I liked the most are the insights and cinematography on how people have adapted to life in the Arctic. Also the portrayal of real life situations. I have read that murder is more common than though, especially over women.

The ""non big screen film"" look of the movie (Use of DV), while at first I thought would be a negative, turned out to be a positive. It often gave me the feeling as if I was right there witnessing their lives being played out first hand.

(Perhaps this is more of a cultural condition of our relatively faster paced lives and expectations - alot of movies in the past and in some places of the world still have intermissions at theatres, nothing wrong with that) Yes, it is confusing in some parts - better transitions or simple text on screen when time periods changed would have been helpful.

But, all in all an excellent effort. Highly recommended. I really want to give it 4.5 stars if I could, but will be happy with 4, in hopes that another movie with a story from the Arctic Inuit will be made that I can give a 5!! Perhaps a different region of the Arctic too.",1093910400,4,1524,4.333333333333333

I am surprised how much I liked this film, despite I found it somewhat a little too slow during the first half.  However, I hope they could add more onto the 2nd Disc's Special Features.  I went through it within 15 mins or so.  The extra audio clips are awfully short, and the ""Behind the Scenes"" are exactly the same as the footage shown during the Ending Credits on the first disc.  So its quite a disappointment.
I'd say the DVD set is more of a 4 out of 5.  But the movie itself is definately worth-watching, despite its length.  I definately would love to see more Inuit films in the future.",1093737600,,806,4.2631578947368425

This is actually kind of a Shakespearean-type story.  It's interesting by virtue of being exposed to a completely different culture and way of life, but it got boring when it entered into it's THIRD HOUR.

 A powerful mythic story. Like a Greek tragedy, the world of this Inuit clan is disrupted and disharmony is introduced. Is it an evil spirit? Or selfish human choices made contrary to the social norms? The relucant hero is exiled but gains strength and returns to purge the evildoers and restore the natural order. [I suspect G. Bush might ""get"" the this movie.]

 A fascinating ethnographic study of a very different way of life. Dog sleds and survival depending on the dogs, seal hunting through the ice, blubber eating, igloo building, etc.

 Many wonderful, vivid scenes. Building the igloo. Then the fight inside on the icy floor. The hero hiding from his pursuers under a pile of sea weed, pee-ed on by the unknowing bad guy. And most memorably, the hero escaping murder, running naked across what looks like an endless, flat sheet of ice. I bet we'll never see Brad Pitt or Harrison Ford do something like that.

 And the ""poetic"", meditative cinematography. True, it's grainy digital video, but what an impression! The landscape looks Godforsaken, desolate and frightening but beautiful in its own way.",1091404800,3,1192,4.866336633663367

1787896,5,B00006RG78,"What have I gotten myself into? I'm watching valiant but impossible acting, undoubtedly by some amateurs, in a movie about modern tribal people in the Arctic Circle that is ... videotaped? Where's the Cinerama? This is slow-going. I'm checking the screen to insure I pressed the 'PLAY MOVIE' icon. Seems like an added feature. This is indeed, the movie. My eyes are getting bugged out by staring at the Arctic Circle on videotape. This is, I suppose what I would expect from people living in The Arctic Circle. A lot of sitting around in igloos. Hunting fresh meat. Cleaning fresh kill. You can't very well take people like this and expect them to act. A story begins to emerge, as if being told in a nightime story session igloo sit-around. I'm staring into the fire listening and watching the penetraing light and relieving shadows. It's a love story. Guy wants girl but girl's father not so sure. Ouch! Did that guy just kick that sled dog? Where's the injured animal disclaimer? That dog yelped in pain. This is ... too real. Another dog snarls and bites. Will somebody please wipe the snot off that baby's nose? Some of these performances start becoming sharply defined. I'm rooting for the hero and hissing at the villain. Let me review. I'm watching genuine Arctic tribal people acting in front of a camera in their own environment, outreaching the boundries of moviedom by claiming the story told and handed down through ages is the human possession of the heart, and the only reality. The sad, shocking revelation in the closing credits make it all too, too real. I'm all over the internet trying to find information about this wonderful movie.",1086134400,5,1653,4.783216783216783
1787897,4,B00006RG78,"This is one of those movies that start out really slow, but if you hang in there and make it through the first forty-five minutes, you will end up satisfied. In my opinion the creators of ""The Fast Runner"" use the slow pace in the movie as a reflection of the speed at which life moves in the Inuit tribe on which the story focuses.
The movie starts when a demon visits an Inuit group and curses them. At this time, Tulimag is having trouble to feed his family and already starts receiving a treatment that is not the ""usual"" this society gives to its members. Eskimos are known for their generosity and solidarity, but Tulimag becomes the object of ridicule and he is only given the leftovers from the food the others get. Years later, his two sons are well respected and some of the best hunters in the group. Atanarjuat and Amaqjuart have a good life and are very close to each other. Atanarjuat is in love with Atuat, but she is promised to Oki, who is willing to fight for her.  In the meantime, Oki's sister, Puja, is interested in Atanarjuat. The events develop and we get to see the special rules they use in their ""duels"" and their customs regarding marriages. When a severe tragedy knocks on the door, the adventure picks up in pace and the interest of the audience is grabbed until the end without letting go.
Except for the painfully slow pace at the beginning, this is a highly enjoyable movie. Nevertheless, you have to be in the mood to sit down for three hours and be patient until the events turn into something really interesting. Apart from the story in this particular case, I enjoyed learning about the uses and culture of this society, about which I knew very little. The other remarkable aspect is the photography, which is absolutely stunning! Overall, I think it is a creation worth seeing, but you have to carefully pick the moment to do so.",1082851200,13,1867,4.507374631268436
1787898,4,B00006RG78,"Well, I've just finished watching Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner, and my impressions are as follows:
Most of the time, the movie doesn't feel like it's shot by a professional.  I think the director has yet to break away from his  ""documentary"" style (his previous movies were all documentaries); much of the movie feels like it was shot in one take. Director Zacharias Kunuk shows a skill for shooting balanced landscape compositions (perhaps he should watch some of Russian director Tarkovsky's movies for further inspiration?), but the shots tend to be a bit awkward most of the time because of the aforementioned one-take shooting. He also shows remarkable restraint in using the zoom function of the camera, even in parts where it could have dramatically improved the look of certain scenes.
The very beginning of this movie is indeed, as many have mentioned, rather confusing. Perhaps it would have been better to have a narrator or some text telling the viewers what was happening, because as it was it was very difficult to understand. Kunuk makes the mistake of assuming the audience knows as much as he knows, and therefore doesn't explain what is happening as throughly as he should have.  For example, how are viewers supposed to know that the necklace made of bones is worn by the chief, and that what is shown in the beginning is the ceremony for the choosing of the chief?
Despite all of this however, the movie shines with what can best be described as a passion for the subject matter.  The director seems to truly feel for his culture and characters, and he shows it in the movie. He shows us all of the realities of the life of the Inuit with an understanding of someone who was born to it; the drudgery of chores, the sex life (this movie is NOT for children), life in the winter and in the summer.  Despite the distracting shooting style, I soon became drawn into the movie simply through the power of the scenarios and the actors (who seemed to get better as the movie progressed).
Even with some amateurish errors here and there (eg. how come Amaqjuat doesn't even scream when a spear is supposedly inserted into him through the tent?), this is a powerful movie. I hope it is not Zacharias Kunuk's last; he shows a lot of promise as a director.",1081728000,,2263,4.675879396984925
1787899,5,B00006RG78,"The beauty of this movie lies in its unique style that pulls viewers up close with the people and the action, allowing us to catch a glimpse of rich Inuit culture and their harsh yet life-sustaining beautiful homeland through seasons.  The material culture was meticulously researched and presented as beautiful clothing, ice architecture, and other personal belongings, which  are sometimes given hidden meanings for ""the Southern"" viewers.  Maybe our storyteller Zacharias Kunuk intentionally made them more eloquent than the spoken narrative, which is curiously kept minimal.  When I first saw it I was often confused about what is happening until I learned more about the legend much later.
I recommend the ""Deluxe"" DVD set available from www.amazon.ca, which comes with special features including the original legend, the production diary, cast bios, and family trees of Atanarjuat and Oki.  You can get the same information from [...]  Those materials are very helpful to appreciate the movie.

I was lucky to be in Canada last summer when I caught three episodes of ""Nunavut (Our Land)"" on Bravo!, produced by Igloolik Isuma Production in 1995, which tells tales of an Inuit community in 1940s with a style similar to Atanarjuat.

1787901,4,B00006RG78,"""The Fast Runner"" has many unique qualities.  Its story about the titular character Atanarjuat comes from the legend assorted from eight elder members of the Inuit people; its characters are played by mainly Inuit non-prodessionals; and their native  language is spoken in the film, respecting the oral tradition of their literature.
As the facts above suggest, the film makes you feel like watching an epic-scale tale that happened one thousand years ago, a kind of experience reading Homer.  The story is about Atanarjuat and his clan, who live in Igloolik, Nunavut (northern part of today's Canada).  After several generations stories (which include murders done off-screen), we meet young Atanarjuat and his elder brother Aamarjuaq.  Atanarjuat falls in love with a girl named Atuat, but it was decided that she should be the bride of Uqi, vulger and rude son of the chief.  They nevertheless marry, after Uqi's humiliating experience, and when Atanarjuat takes another wife Puja, who is frivolous, troubles ensue, which eventually bring misery, pain, and even death.
Though I admire the film's beauty and narrative strength, I should say the opening part is too confusing, filled with too many people's names.  It sounds like Homer.  If you have read ""Illiad,"" you feel dismayed seeing too many characters names.  ""The Fast Runner"" at first gives you similar feelings, but be patient.  Everything gradually starts to be interesting, if you just follow the main four characters.
In the middle of the film, where you see most realistic violence done, you will never stop watching the story of the Fast Runner, who in fact must run fast for his life, on the thin icefield, completely naked.  This is one of the most impressive chase scenes done on screen in the movie history.  You never forget it.
The clothes and customes of the characters of the Inuits long time ago are re-produced, and the film, I am afraid, shows too much of them, but maybe I just didn't understand some part of the customs they follow.  They are all interesting, but of course you know that the today's Inuits are not living the way the film depicts (their modern life can be inferred from the end credits, where you can see how they shot the film, using snow-mobiles).
The film is sometimes hard to follow -- for example, Atanarjuat taking two wives, the custom that is no longer among the Inuits.  The film is certainly too long (nearly 3 hours), but the beauty of the film is undeniable, and the natural presence of the characters is always fresh and engaging to see.  They are no actors, but that doesn't matter.  The film goes slowly, so you watch and enjoy it slowly too.",1067212800,7,2654,4.864444444444445

The end credits document how much the filmmakers (actors and production people) wanted to bring this story to us in a medium we could understand.  I was very cynical about my ability to like a movie this long in such a language.  After 3 hours, I felt at home, covered in seal skins and my belly full of seal meat. My curiosity about what I didn't grasp has me researching this film and story.  It is not for everybody, but, for the movie viewer who loves to seek truth from every culture and find another link in that human experience, 3 hours will almost seem too short.  I don't know how well I would survive that north in Canada, but I have a vague idea how to survive because of this film.  I will never complain about rolling blackouts again.

The eldest son must hunt for food and get along with other tribe's they meet.  But some tribes are called ""strangers"".  They try to steal someone's dog sled, food or kill for what they want.  The Fast Runner can keep it all together.  An evil tribe tries to kill by stabbing the tent he and another man is sleeping in.  Naked, he escapes and runs for his life and even appears to run on water while enemies fall through.  This film, shot on video, also deals with evil spirits, love, death and leadership.  But mostly, the family stays together no matter what.  There are scenes of full frontal male nudity, female nudity, sex and simulated violence.",1057881600,,751,4.66412213740458
1787936,4,B00006RG78,"Atanarjuat loves Atuat. His father was a bit of a tribal ne'er-do-well, and he is very close to  his brother, literally and figuratively, throughout the film, as he courts Atuat, fights for her, wins her, loses her, and returns to her despite the murderous machinations of Oki, son of the tribe's chief.
This film tells a classic tale, but the fact that it is Inuit makes it especially interesting; the pace is different and the light is more stark, a bit like Scent of Green Papaya for the northern climes. The first time the camera opens onto the snow-filled tundra, your eyes will be shocked.

The acting is very good, many things can be seen in a look or a smile, and the details of clothing and everyday life are incredible. For a technologized Westerner, it can be jarring to adapt to the pace of the film, but it is filled with drama, love, violence, life and death, and the experience is eminently worthwhile.

DVD features are abysmal, however.  I would have *loved* a behind-the-scenes documentary or commentary by the cast and crew, particularly since this is such a rarity -- an Inuit film, but the only extras are trailers for Lagaan, Lawrence of Arabia and Limbo.

The exact era that the story is taking place is very difficult to establish, because the Inuit do not use much metallic items or new technologies. It seems that every tool, clothes or transport means they use are hand made by them. It was a bit of a struggle to get into the film at the beginning and I found myself wondering just who was doing what to whom. It moves at a snail's pace (but that's part of its charm) and it goes on for nearly three hours but none of that time is wasted. It provides a stunning observation of Inuit culture and tradition, especially on how they deal with disputes and legal issues, with the core issue being that of the polygamy custom which is actually a matter of survival as women are provided only by their menfolk. The film only really takes off when the two sons of one of the families that has been cursed grow up. The film doesn't need any special effects because the Arctic backdrop provides them, and the spare and empty landscape gives this drama a mythic feel. It is worth hanging in there as it will captivate you soon enough. The film is VERY realistic and there are clear displays of cruelty towards animals, because beating dogs is obviously a part of everyday life in the Arctic and the director didn't want to hide it.
