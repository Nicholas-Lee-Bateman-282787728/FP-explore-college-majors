8305381,5,B000QCTG52,"A rare look into a forgotten and glossed over chapter of Los Angeles and American history.

This video should be required viewing in every middle and high school.",1455926400,,162,4.785714285714286
8305382,4,B000QCTG52,"This is an engrossing, well researched and well conceived documentary on the thriving Japanese-American community that developed in San Pedro, and especially East San Pedro--today's Terminal Island--in the decades before 1941.  Today, the canneries are gone, the fishing fleet is greatly diminished, and all traces of the former community have been built over and effectively erased.  This video should be of interest not just to local historians, but to a wider audience interested in Japanese-Americans, ethnic relations, the WWII internment policy, pre-WWII life, etc.",1346112000,,571,5.785714285714286
