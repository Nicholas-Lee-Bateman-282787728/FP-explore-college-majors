6300199,5,B00IVLR9OU,"You MUST own this film.  I don't care who you are, we all love watching the Japanese Snow Monkeys lolling in their heated pool in Winter!  This documentary is gentle, kind, sweet, educational and will truly soothe the ""savage breast"". The storyline is an added bonus!  My FAVORITE film.  Great for rowdy kids before bedtime!",1416873600,3,324,4.836363636363636
6300200,5,B00IVLR9OU,"Five stars are NOT enough.  This film is THERAPY. So, so beautiful and heartwarming. Saw it on TV and ordered it right away to use as a de-stresser and for  sheer enjoyment as a nature lover.  Plan to have movie night with it with my grandkids, though I will forewarn there are a couple harsh nature scenes involving violence and (spoiler alert) death. The relationships between the 'stars' of the show, and the scenery,  will melt your heart and provide a getaway from a fast paced life. Brings you back to the sanctity and peace of life stripping it of all superficial things and leaving only ....love.",1416182400,5,604,4.616822429906542

6300208,5,B00IVLR9OU,"I really liked this and learned a lot, loved the photography, and was pleasantly surprised at the nice little story that went along with it (think cute baby monkey & grumpy ""old man"" monkey).  =)  I don't watch nature programs all that often, only when something really catches my eye, and I'm glad I watched this one.  Another thing--they kept the traumas of being a snow monkey to a minimum, which I appreciated.  Definitely 5 stars from me.",1401753600,4,443,4.641025641025641
