7975371,1,B00007ELDO,"I love this movie. I saw it when it came out in the early 70's. So why only 1 star, the DVD reproduction is poor. Bad picture, too many clicks and clangs, and a whole part of the movie gone missing. Very disappointing.",1474243200,,218,4.093023255813954
7975372,4,B00007ELDO,"I haven't purchased this film yet. I watched it on youtube. If I can find it for a reasonable price, then I'll get it. This is a fabulous reinterpretation of the well-known Aristophanes play, Lysistrata. It is mainly set in caveman times and relies on caveman humor most of the time. But it is cute and hilarious. The cave-dwellers go to war against the lake-dwellers. Their wives withhold sex (making ding dong) until the men declare peace.

For those who were disappointed at the lack of nudity in this piece.... that's totally not what this flick is about. And although there may be a few brief moments, they are not the reason anyone should be interested in this flick.

However, I would imagine this is the kind of movie the ""Z"" Channel would air as a ""cult movie classic"" if they were still around.",1392076800,,804,4.576388888888889
7975373,1,B00007ELDO,"Stink, Stank, Stunk, unwatchable literally and figuratively.  The absolute worst film quality I've ever seen, and don't let the title fool you there is almost zero ""before no clothes""....",1294531200,4,187,5.448275862068965
7975374,1,B00007ELDO,"I bought this by mistake, I thought this movie was ""When women had tails"" which i thought was very funny when I first saw a while back.",1285113600,,135,4.037037037037037
7975375,4,B00007ELDO,"I saw this short on Comcast on Demand, and since cheesy, low quality films are so entertaining to me, I was inviting friends over to watch. With the oddball characters and hilariously flat dialogue...not to mention my favorite elements: crap props and random skips in the film, we found ourselves in stitches. If you're expecting cheesecake, there's about 10 seconds of it. But if you're a fan of bad film production and random situations, I highly recommend this film. I wish there were more like this! I have yet to see the other film, so I plan on purchasing this DVD asap!",1223769600,,576,4.6568627450980395
7975376,1,B00007ELDO,"From the title this sounds like its some good softcore sexy stuff. No sir. Boring, lame, NO NUDITY!!!! How can it have no Nudity? Why is it rated R, it could have been PG.

So lame, the caveman joke gets old after 5 minutes. The women are hot, but don't expect to seem them naked, even though the title says ""BC 'Before Clothes'"". they have no 'clothes' but plenty animal skin modestly covering all the goods.

A disappointment from something weird.",1150070400,29,449,4.530864197530864
