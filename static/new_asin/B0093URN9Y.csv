5256565,4,B0093URN9Y,I really like this dual dvd yoga set.  Each dvd has a variety of 20 minute programs to choose from w/ some additional 5-10 min area specific/mediatation programs.  You can select as many or as little programs as you like at one time.  Some of the moves are a little advanced for a beginer/intermediate yogi or someone who is not very flexable ie.me. It would be nice if on the more advanced moves Shiva would have provided alternative options for those less experinced.  However still a very good set for most any beginer/intermediate home yogi.,1386288000,15,545,4.705263157894737
5256566,4,B0093URN9Y,"She us the bat yoga instructor that I have come across. She is hard on beginners, but great after you are doing it for a while. The extra DVD, however, seems heartedly done. Like she did it in a hurry.",1376524800,2,201,4.05
5256567,5,B0093URN9Y,"Her flows are easy to follow with modifications and I love the matrix aspect.  Depending on your needs, such as mine, Core and strength, you can design your own Practice from her many offered selection.  I have been working out my lifetime and Yoga has had the greatest satisfying results.  Kudos to this DVD!",1373846400,,309,4.685185185185185
5256568,5,B0093URN9Y,I love the way that you can select your workouts and each one transitions nicely while your in pose. This is a more advanced DVD and in my opinion not really a beginner variety. Check out some of the Gaiam dvds with Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman. They ease you into poses and build you up to the next level well. I've done Yoga for many years so I'm not knew to it. The Daily Practice DVD is a great one to get started with; 5 days of workouts that are short and sweet.,1370217600,2,470,4.01063829787234
5256569,5,B0093URN9Y,I was having lots of lower back pain and decided to give yoga a try to help.  Shiva Rea's DVD is both challenging and soothing - a wonderful choice!,1364342400,6,148,4.103448275862069
5256570,5,B0093URN9Y,I love this set!! I had done a small part on demand of the more daily energy and HAD to buy it! It is challenging yet it can still be done by someone who is not a yoga professional. I really think this Dvd set makes a difference in my moods because it is calming as well as a full body workout!,1361923200,3,294,3.7580645161290325

5256574,3,B0093URN9Y,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm sure that for enthusiasts  of this form of yoga will like it, I tried this flow series and it just doesn't do it for me.  I started yoga in the kundalini  style and can't seem to get into any other forms.  Not the fault of Shiva--my own shortcomings  I guess in only liking the kundalini style which really seems to provide a more  aerobic experience along with moves related to the chakras.",1482710400,3,427,4.341772151898734
5256575,5,B0093URN9Y,"Oh this collection is so fantastically challenging.  I am an intermediate novice and I am always looking for something to push me into the next realm.  This is doing it.  I am not sure why other reviewers state that she did not do much ""teaching"", as I really enjoy her teaching style.  She is very calm.  She does offer you to remain in lead up poses if you cannot make it into the next more advanced poses, so I know I will get more out of this workout as I keep practicing it.  Really excellent workout!",1478649600,,506,4.21875

Workout is intense, I am a beginner and I am no where near as close to doing the things she does in the video but I have noticed improvement in areas. Worth every second, I just wish she used other words to describe what she is doing. It can be hard to understand if you are new to Yoga like I am.

5256584,2,B0093URN9Y,"Why is it so difficult to just find a good yoga DVD to do at home!?  First off, I really dislike programs that are voiced over because they don't always match up well and are more difficult to follow.  I don't like programs where I feel I have to watch the TV to find out what is going on, which this one I had to look up periodically to find out what was happening.  I only did a few of the ""matrix's"", however, when she started doing mountain climbers I was out.  This was not yoga, this was ""I'm gonna make this unique and interesting and different"" and it was a big old flop.

I just want to do yoga.  YOGA!",1459123200,4,611,4.008264462809917

5256588,5,B0093URN9Y,"I have many Shiva Rea disks, but this is my 'go-to' daily workout.  It love that you can mix and match sessions depending on your schedule.  The segments are the right balance of challenging workout and stretching.  Each pose lingers long enough to allow you to extend and find your edges.  Perhaps not suitable for a true beginner, but people from basic to advanced will find this a useful tool.  I only wish it was set in a more dramatic setting.  A yoga studio is not nearly as inviting as White Sands, Hawaii, or the beaches of India.",1453334400,3,538,4.438775510204081
5256589,5,B0093URN9Y,"I love that there are so many options for shorter workouts! I also love the flow of the practices. This is the first yoga video I've tried where I actually broke a light sweat (about 15 minutes in to the Water practice). Very refreshing, and I felt like I got a good workout in just a short time. Shiva Rea is very calming and does a great job describing what to envision (i.e. grounding yourself to the earth via specific points).",1452816000,,431,4.333333333333333
5256590,3,B0093URN9Y,"I am certified to teach prana flow through Shiva Rea's teacher training program. It is a style I love and have embodied in my practice for 6-7 years. After two knee surgeries and with a hectic work and life schedule I decided to explore more of her DVDs so that I could practice on my own time and get back into a daily practice (while rehabbing my second knee surgery I was unable to do yoga for year plus, so my personal practice has suffered and I have to rebuild what was lost in that time frame). For me the idea of 20 min daily routines that I could fit in daily and then combine for longer practices as time permitted was great and why I bought this set (NOTE this is a set and both of these DVDs are sold separately - I note this because I also bought ""More Daily Energy"" which I will now be returning as it is one of the two DVDs included).

Pros:
I love the style (hence getting certified in it)
There are 20 min segments or ""waves"" (though these are not complete sequences and are not the pre-set sequences which range form 37-55 mins) rather you can go in the matrix and select a 20 min segment
It has injected some variety into my personal practice, which because of my injury has become a bit stale.

Cons:
These are intermediate to advanced, and even as someone who is certified in Prana Flow I at times had trouble following (not all of the transitional cues are clear and it felt faster then a typical prana flow sequence/wave
There are few modifications or kramas offered - people with injuries, new to yoga, or new to this style may have trouble self modifying or using a krama (an foundational or less advanced pose that would provide the same energetic flow)
Because I am certified I know kramas and because of my injury I have and use props (blocks, straps, etc); however because of the pace set (which felt faster then a typical prana flow sequence/wave (typically a wave would be made up of 2-3 poses or kramas to build and prepare your body to reach the final pose) I was challenged to have time to incorporate modifications before she would move on to a new pose. For example, in the 20 min segment I did this morning over 8-12 poses versus a typical 3-5 that would be a part of a 20 min wave.

All in all I gave it a 3 because it is ok, for the intermediate to advanced (or those not rebuilding their practice post injury) it is probably great. For the new/beginner level or those rebuilding their practice it is challenging to follow; but does offer a great deal of variety and flexibility - so if you don't let the challenge overtake you, you have a lot of opportunity for growth. I would say if you are a beginner or newer to Prana flow you may want to watch the segments first then join in the practice. I know time consuming; but it will help you in following along. I would also say don't be put off because you can't do every pose she does immediately; take the stage/or pose you can while working towards full expression of the pose she is offering.",1452643200,21,2984,4.306049822064057
5256591,5,B0093URN9Y,"I had a hard time keeping up with her, I am a beginner, but it's a great video when I am able to. Very sore today! Lol.",1452211200,,119,3.4444444444444446
5256592,5,B0093URN9Y,"Excellent flows.  Love the make your own matrix.  Menu is blue on blue, it's a little hard to see sometimes.",1446854400,,108,4.35
5256593,4,B0093URN9Y,"I like how many options you have with this DVD.  There are 7 20 minute practices that can be done alone or together to make longer routines.  I like sticking to 20 minutes a day.  I know I can fit that into a hectic schedule.  And they do work.  You will help unwind and relax your body as well as tone your muscles and increase your flexibility.

I like that there is so much variety so I don't get bored with it.  I haven't tried all the routines yet but through the ones that I have done there is a good mix of beginner to intermediate.  I haven't seen too much advanced stuff yet, which is good because I'm not there yet.  It is vinyasa flow, which keeps you moving so you can get in a workout while you are relaxing with your yoga.

Shiva is a great instructor.  I have heard great things about her and wanted to try one of her DVDs.  She has good cuing and a soft gentle voice that helps relax you.  I have tried some of her other videos online and was not as impressed with them as I was with this.

I would recommed this video.  It is a great addition to a collection.",1445904000,4,1076,4.033175355450237
5256594,5,B0093URN9Y,"I am a beginner to mind-body healing yoga who sought it out as part of a wellness program while dealing with injuries sustained after years of irresponsible workouts (marathons, dance, teenage post-binge workouts, etc) had trashed my body and left me with several chronic pain issues and ongoing injuries.

This DVD has been the PERFECT workout for someone like me--unlike other yoga DVDs (which I could not do, because they basically just take yoga moves and use them as ""reps"" to try and work up a sweat and burn calories), this DVD actually taught me to use each yoga pose for wellness, breathing, centering, becoming more mindful, while slowly, gracefully, elongating, reaching, strengthening, toning etc as a lovely natural byproduct of that effort, but in a more slow and rhythmic manner, and not the fast-paced Jane Fonda manner on the other DVDs I have tried and tossed.

Shiva Rea's poses are challenging but doable for the beginner, then grow gradually more difficult, but the ""More"" DVD is the one beginners should start with, as her first DVD was actually harder. And a word to the wise: it hurt my neck to look up at the TV, so I actually bought the digital copy, too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiva-Rea-More-Daily-Energy/dp/B007PYFCGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiva Rea: More Daily Energy</a>&nbsp;so I could put my smartphone/tablet right there under me and learn the moves without craning my neck. Then once I had mastered the moves, I could play the DVD in the family room--but I really enjoy having both the DVD and digital copy, because I need the digital copy for when I travel and to help me mastering moves where I have to keep my head down, but I need the DVD copy when I'm mastering moves where I have to keep my head up! Best of both worlds, since they don't cost very much anyway! :)",1445817600,17,1861,5.038961038961039
5256595,5,B0093URN9Y,"I really enjoy these DVDs. You can exercise for as long or as short as you wish to thanks to the matrix. Sometimes it's hard to follow as she goes fast but with practice this goes away. Shiva is very calm, concentrated and determined. I look forward to exercising with these DVDs every time :-) I invited a yoga loving friend to exercise with me and she said that this is so different from everything she has tried in the past.",1442102400,,427,4.283950617283951

I love having the option of customizing my practice for calming before bed. I did this matrix for the first time and I felt so good when I went to bed and slept even better that night as a result of doing her practice. Shiva Rea is so good at her instruction and after you finish a routine with her you feel so good. She is thorough in her instruction, and she leaves you with the sense of, ""I cannot wait for my next practice!"" I highly recommend her yoga videos. You can definitely see her experience and skill with teaching hatha yoga.",1430784000,,704,4.1838235294117645

I would say that like in an advanced class (after not practicing for awhile), there are poses I ignore... nope! my body is not ready for that.  So I just pick and choose which means I can come back later and do the more advanced poses if I feel like it.  So, that's what you are getting here... she loves crow pose!!
