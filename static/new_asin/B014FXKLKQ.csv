8730568,5,B014FXKLKQ,"These movies are more enjoyable to watch on DVD rather than waiting to get back from the tons of ads that you're bombarded with. The only complaint that I have is: ""The case is very flimsy."" Most DVD's sold today come in a case that has a window. I'm sure this is called something else, but this weakens the structure. It would be stronger if the pattern was left inside, rather than removed. This is just a thought. Most of us store our movies in the cases and we hope they'll hold up.",1501977600,2,486,4.236559139784946
