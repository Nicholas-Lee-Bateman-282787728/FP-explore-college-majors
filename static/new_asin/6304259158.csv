818669,3,6304259158,"This is a very good action movie that seems to fall apart at the end and the script has a makeshift feeling to it in the last few scenes. Keanu Reeves gives a wonderful performance however...he has a heavier ""man  on the street"" look and a ""diamond in the rough"" quality in  this. A lot of hard work was put into this film (some of it in extremely  cold water !) and most of the action scenes are terrific, (the one on the  bridge is great !)so it's well worth it for those of us who appreciate  Keanu's talent.",961113600,5,511,4.121212121212121
818670,3,6304259158,"As far as action goes, it gets 5 stars; however, just great action sequences don't make up for a very confusing plot. Keanu's runaway from the explosion on his motorcycle, the drawbridge and hovercraft action sequences  were great!  These scenes and several others definitely save this  movie.
The acting was very good especially by Morgan Freeman and Keanu  Reeves.  Rachel Weisz was good but did not portray anywhere near as much  charisma as Freeman and Reeves.
The chemistry was there almost from the  beginning between Eddie (Reeves) and Lily (Weisz) but not even one kiss!  I  don't think the director, Andrew Davis watched ""The Terminator.""  I wish he had; then he would have discovered that a love scene could have  been implemented successfully.
If you are a Morgan Freeman or Keanu  Reeves fan you will enjoy to rent this out and watch it twice.  I wouldn't  recommend buying it.  (If you want to see Morgan Freeman at his best, go  buy ""Shawshank Redemption.""  If you want Keanu Reeves at his  best, go buy ""The Matrix"" and ""A Walk in the  Clouds."")
Chain Reaction is good but not anywhere close to ""The  Fugitive.""",960940800,19,1126,4.765625
818671,2,6304259158,"If you can believe Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist (as in ""The World is Not Enough""), then you can buy Keannu Reeves as the savior of the world with his scientific knowledge in this film.
How Morgan Freeman  kept a straight face throughout filming is a compliment to his great acting  ability.",959385600,3,300,4.6415094339622645
818672,1,6304259158,This movie was about as interesting and believable as a typical Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.  There is a lot of good science fiction out there but Keanu Reeves was not part of it until The Matrix (his other  nortorious stinker being Johnny Mnemonic),955324800,2,249,4.767441860465116
818673,5,6304259158,"having only seen speed once i thought it was great till i saw this, the storyline was immense and we saw some excellent acting as always from morgan freeman, if you haven't seen this movie go out right now and buy it,  you won't be disappointed!",953424000,3,245,4.326086956521739
818674,5,6304259158,"This movie is one of the better action films to come out of Hollywood since Speed, which also starred Keanu Reeves. Combining suspense, chases and a plot that never tells why until the end, this is one of those films  that keep its audiences entertained, tuned in, and waiting on the edge of  their seat holding their breath for what comes next. Keanu Reeves and  Rachel Weisz, while being an unlikely pair of love interests, have a  chemistry unmatched by many others, and they play their characters to  perfection. The special effects, when required, work very well, though  sometimes one can tell the difference between reality and wizardry. But  this movie still remains a true action thriller, and I recommend it to all  who saw Speed, whether they liked Speed or not.",952041600,9,773,4.803030303030303

818766,4,6304259158,"Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) is first among his colleagues searching for free clean energy to better the world. On the eve of what looks like success a horrible accident (yeah right) dispatches Dr. Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall.)

Eddie complains that it was not an accident so of course everyone knows that Eddie is the culprit assisted by colleagues Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz), and Lu Chen (Tzi Ma). While his employer Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman) is unshakably not sure (why?).

As with most mysteries the only way to prove his innocence is to find the guilty.

All the parts are well played and the story is just in plausibility. The twists and turns will keep you intrigued until the last. Not too long of a chase scene.",1507248000,,739,4.803149606299213

818771,5,6304259158,"This is an excellent film. This depicts a story where a group of scientist develop a way to create unlimited hydrogen gas from water. As soon as they get the process working, and they are ready to release the process to the world, chaos breaks loose. Murders, kidnapping and a search for key people begins, all driven by the government. The entire process will be taken over by the government and never shared with the world that needs it

Unfortunately this its too close to the truth of what would really happen. The governments of the world want the status quo to stay in place. The argument is that the economy based on hydrocarbons would collapse. Unlimited clean energy would help to solve our pollution problem and stabilize the world.

This film is well done and the cast was very good. It is full of action and I liked it. I saw the film when it was released and we just watched it again.

I rated it at 5 stars and I recommend it to you.

819160,4,6304259158,"Though this movie was not a great commercial or critical success at the time it came out (1996), I watched it again recently (it's 2016, so 20 yrs later) and found that I liked it even better than the first time I saw it many years ago.  The premise - taking water and using laser technology to produce energy from it -- may not be very sound from a technical point of view (I am not knowledgeable enough about physics & chemistry to criticize this idea, and I'm sure others who are have already done this), but I applaud the basic story, which juxtaposes the notion of free & abundant energy for all with government concerns that such a thing would destroy world economies and cause more problems than it solves.  I'm an avid environmentalist, but not so jaded that I can't see at least some of the other side of the issue (as presented in this film).  The acting and action are great; we get to see Rachel Weisz in one of her very earliest roles, as well as a fairly young Keanu Reaves.  Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always, as a shadowy individual running a ""nonprofit"" that deals with energy research.  Fred Ward as an FBI agent and Brian Cox (pre-Bourne) as a smarmy CIA agent (I assume that's what he is; it's never specified) round out a great cast of actors.  The catalyst for action is when the lab where the energy research is being carried out (in Chicago) explodes and two young members of the team (Reeves & Weisz) are framed for the disaster.  They are forced to go on the run, but Weisz is eventually captured and Reeves has to rescue her from the group who actually blew up their lab.  Meanwhile, the FBI is hot on their trail.  I love that Weisz is a physicist - great use of an intelligent young woman character (before that became mainstream).  I think this movie is well worth another watch, esp. in light of our current energy problems.  Plain old water may not be the answer, but it's a good premise.",1474416000,14,1925,4.409604519774011

Reeves performs well, as the much put upon hero, and Rachel Weisz began her Hollywood career with a reasonably good performance as the lady in distress. Others in the cast performed well in the more limiting roles of FBI agents. assorted Bad guys and the like. A rather typical plot as the ""for the good of mankind"" scientists are forced to confront the realities of power politics, money-grabbing and generally all-round nastiness. Along with the usually incoherent explanation of just what the  scientific stuff is all about, there is plenty of action, death by guns, explosions and other assorted varieties of mayhem, along with a very stunted bit of romance.

819618,5,6304259158,"""The Vanishing"" has been a top favorite of mine for some years, and I was glad to see it offered on dvd.  Jeff Bridges is brilliant as a French guy who decides to try killing women.  After several comedic failures, he abducts Sandra Bullock.  This must be one of her first roles.  She is young and so cute as 'Diane', the loved girlfriend of Keifer Sutherland.  He grows obsessed with finding her.  Finally meeting her abductor, he gets his chance to find out what happened to her, but he has to go through what she went through in order to at last know.  A top thriller.",1445040000,,571,4.330188679245283

Then things turn sinister when their boss is killed and the lab blows up, and from that point on they're basically on the run trying to escape from whoever killed him and figure out who is behind it.  This film has some twists and surprises but is otherwise fairly predictable.  I enjoyed the acting, though.  Keanu's chase scenes are nailbiters, and there is a lot of action.

820325,5,6304259158,"For reasons that are still mystifying to me, Andrew Davis's ""Chain Reaction"" was met with negative critical reaction and weak box office returns when it was released in August of 1996. Davis, known for having made the smash-hit ""The Fugitive"" three years before, was clearly expecting another hit from a film that resembles ""The Fugitive"" in many key respects. Although not as good as the pitch-perfect, modern-day classic ""The Fugitive"" (TF), Chain Reaction (CR) still stands out as among the best 1990s action films due to the skill with which it was directed, the intriguing and though-provoking plot, and the mesmerizing performance of Morgan Freeman. Yes, the film's other star, Keanu Reeves, is not a great actor, and comparing Harrison Ford in TF to Reeves in CR certainly makes for a let-down. But comparisons only go so far. Without making comparisons, Reeves is as good or better than most action stars these days (2013). His female lead, Rachel Weisz, also puts in a very strong performance. But the film, to a large degree, centers around the mysterious Paul Shannon, played by Freeman. The film is interspersed with limited revelations about Shannon until his exact identity is revealed at the end. Freeman was born to play this character, and I consider this one of his very best performances ever. He brings depth and humanity to what could have been a one-dimensional character. Just watch his testimony before the US Senate--one of the movie's best scenes, and a great example of Freeman's nuanced performance.

No one today films action scenes with the visual coherence that Andrew Davis consistently used. That alone makes the movie stand out. The beautiful wintry landscape and creative sets found throughout CR add to the film's strong visual appeal. Thankfully absent is any sexual content whatsoever, and the language and violence is minimal.

What follows are SPOILERS, SO BE AWARE! CR has been criticized as ""pretending to be smarter than it is."" It has also been criticized by mainstream critics like Janet Maslin of the NY Times and the late Roger Ebert, both of whom liked the film's production values and chase scenes, for being too confusing. Maslin wrote that it's unclear who's doing what to whom during parts of the film. Well, as for smarts, the movie is as smart as it claims to be. It treats the discovery of a new source of energy (from water), and what might happen if that was on the verge of being made public. What forces might oppose it, and why? The film does a good job of presenting the answers to those questions. Aside from various industrial and business interests, the US government would be opposed, fearing it might lead to economic collapses, recessions and ultimately war. In CR, the CIA funds the project but sabotages it when it is on the verge of being made public. They kill the project director and blow up the buildings used for its creation in order to discredit the technology (a point never spelled out explicitly in the movie). One CIA loose-canon, Lyman Collier (played by Brian Cox) frames Reeves' (Eddie) and Weisz's (Lily) characters. He later kills another and threatens to do more. A more moderate CIA agent is Paul Shannon (Freeman). He later admits to making the decision to eliminate the project director (Dr. Barkley), a decision he calls ""a mistake,"" but one that had to be made. Shannon is seen arguing with Barkley early in the film when he tells him what might happen if ""Mandela"" and ""China"" get ahold of the energy project, to which Barkley responds, ""you know how I feel about this,"" i.e., he wants the information released anyway. It is the stooges of Collier who shoot the state trooper in Wisconsin, but deliberately avoid harming Eddie and Lily. He had been informed by Shannon that Reeves is needed to verify the frequency needed the make the energy stable instead of dangerously unstable. Collier's view is that once Reeves verifies the experiment, he will be a liability to be eliminated. Shannon strongly disagrees with that view and says he'll handle it his own way.

Anyone paying attention to the dialogue in this film should have gotten all of that, and then nothing should be particularly unclear about who is doing what to whom and why. At times, there is dialogue that aims to clarify what is going on. After Shannon shoots Collier dead in the elevator, he says: ""I didn't tell you this Lyman, but your retirement had already been arranged."" I.e., the CIA had already decided that Lyman was out of control and needed to be eliminated and Shannon did just that when the opportunity presented itself. In the very last scene, Shannon has his secretary send a memo directly to the director of the CIA, making it clear who Shannon's boss all along had been. (Though midway through the film, the FBI agents investigating the case confront Shannon with the charge that his mysterious foundation is a front for the CIA, which he doesn't deny.) If people wonder, as did Roger Ebert, how Eddie and Lily make it to Washington D.C. from Wisconsin, the movie shows them stealing a car and a montage implying a really long drive. How did Eddie know which part of C-Systems to go to in order to find Lily and Shannon after he arrived at the huge complex? Well, in the previous scene, Shannon asked him to ""continue the work you had been doing,"" and their energy project was a hydrogen project, so the camera shows Eddie looking at a map of C-Systems and finding the area marked ""Hydrogen Project."" That's how he knew where to go.

So if you are willing to watch this movie with an open mind, and to listen carefully to ALL the dialogue, you will it a very intelligently-crafted and thoughtful thriller about the consequences of discovering ""clean, cheap abundant energy,"" as one character says (as shown in the trailer). Andrew Davis oversaw the script rewrites and ensured that it all makes sense. CR is a rare action movie that has NO plot holes. It isn't necessarily plausible, but the story all makes sense. It is the most underrated 1990s action film, and an all-around great piece of escapism.

The Blu-Ray looks and sounds great, with true-surround sound. It is sparse on extra features, though, which is a shame. Maybe it will get a Special Edition some day...",1379894400,,6248,4.813780260707635

Comes on the TV & I'm hooked. And it has Morgan Freeman & he's the best thing IN the movie. (as usual) It has one of my favorite movie lines too.....in the ice boat scene (I won;t spoil it for you). This movie doesn;t pretend to be anything that it's not. Yeah they promote some green dream clean energy from water theory (never gonna happen & the speach by Mr Freeman about why is as true today as it ever was.......ie market collapse etc) but the main thing is...........the chase scenes. PLenty of them & in various interesting places. Coupla good guys get killed, 1 good guy turns out to be a shades-of-grey bad guy (the scariest bad guys are the ones you almost agree with at times -- they treat violence as a logical way of problem solving-- you know: nothing personal guys, just business)the really bad guy gets his comeupance & the good guys are people you can enthusiastically root for. Even makes the FBI look like they can solve a complicated crime scenario. And oh the days before cell phones, GPS, i-whatevers, etc. The good old days. When you had to use a payphone to contact your support people. When the proof is transmitted to the FBI via a FAX machine. Sweeeet. As for character development -- you know more than enough to care about the goodies & just enough to despise the baddies. And the scene at the end where the water tanks steam up & explode is so kitchy that I laugh with glee every time I see it. What a hoot!!  Modern day Frankenstein's lab.

The problem with this one for me was that it took quite a bit more time to finish. Nonetheless, to be fair, I think many people would enjoy seeing two very sick guys, played by Jim Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland, who throw themselves into their parts. Disappointingly, Sandra Bullock, has little more than a walk-on, while Nancy Travis, handles well the tough job of being the only sane one of the remaining trio. In Chain Reaction, Morgan Freeman walks off with the acting honors, while the remainder of the cast play the various Good Guy/Girl parts adequately.

It is also the director's fault that every time Rachel and Keanu run to escape from the bad guys, Keanu has to reach back and grab her hand to pull her along.  She wasn't cripple or retarded -- she didn't need Keanu's macho assistance to run like hell.

The plot is based upon the chemistry of water -- extract hydrogen for fuel -- plentiful, clean and super cheap. Now, try and find the chemistry between Keanu and Rachel.

820549,3,6304259158,"A slick big budget production, Chain Reaction (1996) is a conspiracy based thriller, that proceeds in a by the numbers fashion, never convincing you that it could be real.  At the conclusion you may find that you have been somewhat entertained, but not engaged at a very deep level.

Considering that the film stars Keanu Reaves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weitz, and Fred Ward, this might be somewhat unexpected, but the screenplay is just too superficial to be taken as seriously as it pretends to be.  Characterizing the movie as pretentious might be extreme, but with terrible dialog, poor character development, and a story featuring a nobody responsible for the discovery of a new energy source, you have a high gloss B-movie, with a low reality factor.

Machinist Eddie Kasalivich (Reaves), part of a University of Chicago research team working on a project to generate energy using a fusion process, makes a breakthrough at a mill converted into a research facility.  After a party to celebrate their success, Kasalivich takes his inebriated co-worker, physicist Lily Sinclair (Weitz) home, returns to the plant, and finds that the head of the project, Dr. Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall), has been murdered.  Eddie speeds away just before the plant explodes, destroying several blocks.

In the aftermath, Dr. Lu Chen (Tzi Ma) another scientist is found to be missing, and the FBI discovers evidence that Kasalivich and Sinclair might be involved in transmitting information to the Chinese.  Wanted by the FBI, Eddie and Lily contact Paul Shannon (Freeman), the head of the foundation funding the project, to ask for help.  A memorable action sequence features Kasalivich trapped in a bridge that is being raised, and then evading the police, as the fugitive couple head to an observatory in Wisconsin, where they are given refuge by Eddie's friend Maggie (Joanna Cassidy).

Chain Reaction isn't in touch with reality from the start, and soon drifts off into a fantasy where the pieces too conveniently fit together.  As events unfold, a dark conspiracy is revealed, as the availability of a cheap fuel source means billions are at stake.  The level of action builds, as Lily is captured by agents of a rival company, as Eddie, who has entered action hero mode, attempts to rescue her.  Everything builds to a climax, when a plant designed to produce fuel, is on a countdown to destruction.

Chain Reaction is a slick visually entertaining production, providing moments of excitement, along with some good action scenes, like a chase on frozen lake, and the plant in the process of falling apart.  Besides the action, the cinematography is well done, there are some interesting locations, Jerry Goldsmith contributes a solid soundtrack, and the cast give it a nice try, but in the end, the story is hollow and silly.  Even if intended as some kind of cautionary tale, there is little to be taken seriously.  While not great, if you are seeking a rather predictable comic book type thriller to pass the time, Chain Reaction might fill the bill.  The Bluray edition features a better than average transfer, for a film from 1996, however the lack of any substantial extras besides a trailer, is rather disappointing.",1333756800,,3220,5.032015065913371

So is the existence of a huge, underground research facility which is the movie's setting over its last 30 minutes.  The action sequences were also quite good, with some gunfights, some sabotage, and some explosions giving a good balance of special effects with a tad bit of suspense.  The acting was also quite good, with Morgan Freeman putting in a believable job of portraying a part bad / part good guy.  Keanu Reeves also comes across quite well.

Keenu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, and Brian Cox are magnificent in this taut thriller about espionage over a hydrogen reactor that puts out more energy than runs it. I am a little surprised at the criticism because the explosion looked  like a small hydrogen bomb. Perhaps hydrogen under pressure exploding doesn't look the same, but this is still a good action movie. Considering the abundence of hydrogen, a working reactor is something the whole world wants. Reeves plays an engineer and Ward a physicist working for Freeman. When the head of the project is murdered, another disappears, and the lab is demolished in a 4 block explosion, things get dicey as the FBI hangs the blame on Reeves and thinks Ward is involved as well.

Having said that, the movie wasn't completely worthless.  After I got over my initial irritation during the first ten minutes, I sort of got into the movie.  Some of the chases were sort of fun, and the special effects were pretty cool.  Morgan Freeman is always cool, even if he seems to play pretty much the same character in every movie.  Keanu Reeves did a marginal job, which for him is an improvement (we all love the guy, but even he knows that he can't act).

OK, so it's given a rather obvious title, due to the fact the film jumps from one event to another. None of these events have any links, and are all highly unlikely and stupid to boot.
Morgan Freeman is the true star of this movie, although the constant cigar that he carries around does get a bit annoying. Especially since it's rarely lit.
Keanu Reeves seems to bulk up for certain films (Speed, Matrix), and then all the muscle turns to flab, cos he looks like he generally pigs out. He's unkempt, chubby, unshaven - basically everything you would find UNsexy in a man! And the 'relationship' between his character and Rachel Weisz's character is very unbelievable. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters, and I believe that off screen, they didn't speak to each other. It's highly believable that they didn't spend any time together, so that results in no chemistry. Now if you were watch to Speed - loads of chemistry between Keanu & Sandra Bullock.
This film is not worth the time or the money - oops, says she who bought it! But then again, I'm a Keanu Reeves fan.

It portrays well that things are not as they seem, and that there are shadow conspiracies that at times run the show more than our own elected government does.
To someone who doesn't believe in free energy, this movie might seem contrived and corny.  But I will tell you that from the perspective of one who is immersed in it, and knows of viable technologies that are about to be released, the movie does a fantastic job in its portrayal of the dynamics involved.
My critique of the movie would be of two things: the portrayal of the hydrogen reactor process, and of the scene where Reeves and Weisz get shot out of a mine shaft and then drop back down in on a cable.  Any human being would have probably been killed, yet they didn't even have a broken bone or even a cut.
Their hydrogen reactor looked like something from a decades old Frankenstein movie.  It seems they could have been more convincing.
They make hydrogen power look as though it will be enormously complex to extract.  In reality, my hunch is that when we crack the secret it will not be that complex.

Keanu Reeves gives his standard good-guy action performance.  This movie is done be the same guys that did The Fugitive, and it shows.  The movies have a lot of similarities.
Rachel Weisz does an admirable job and Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman.  Always solid.  Sure, there's some cheesy dialogue.  But you know you're not going in to see Shakespeare.
The sound quality of this DVD is excellent.  Crank up the subwoofer for the explosions.  Picture quality is also well-done.
If you don't mind somewhat cheesy action movies, try checking this one out.",1071446400,2,725,4.766129032258065
820753,2,6304259158,lacks in some horrible acting and story plots but that doesnt change the fact that Reeves and Freeman did a good job in this one...Chain Reaction is just another movie that has some good quality but lacks out in style as it comes out. Rachel Weiz is ok as the physisist. Her and Reeves should of had a love scene I mean come on Andrew Davis..your more focused on your big action scenes then the love connection of the two..god..even after the Chain Reaction accord..GOD!!,1070841600,,471,4.552941176470588
820754,3,6304259158,"The movie was very formulaic and the escapes performed by the 2 main characters seemed unbelievable. I was also bummed out that there was no romance between the 2 leads. I mean if Keanu is the actor they should have put in a romance, at least thats how I see it. The main thing I liked about the film was the plot surrounding petrol and how it was what the whole world wanted. Wow! This movie reflects alot of what I see now, granted that this is my view I speak of. The scientists have found a way to somehow capture energy from hydrogen, this would solve the problem with pollution and the need to fight over power and control involved with petrol. Well, I hope I am saying this right because I watched the movie a few days ago. So, the movie itself was way to predictable and cliched, but the story line was involving.

820758,3,6304259158,"""Chain Reaction"" takes place in the not-so-far future. The world's resources are disappearing and wars are breaking out because of this. So together a team of research scientist are working on a way to use water (H2O) to use as energy. Working on the project include Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman), mechanic Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) and physicist Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz). After years of work, the experiment has become a reality! But before any of the news could be told to anyone, the lab is destroyed including also the four block radius of the place. Before anything can be explained, Eddie and Lily are framed for conspiracy against the government to steal their work to sell to other governments. Eddie and Lily are now fugitives being hunted down by the FBI headed by Leon Ford (Fred Ward) and Doyle (Kevin Dunn). Since everyone believes that they are terrorists and traitors, Eddie and Lily must set out themselves to find out the truth of the matter.
I must say that ""Chain Reaction"" was a little better than I expected it to be, except on the whole it didn't measure up to any of my favorite movies. Good points of the movie are: 1) The three main actors Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz do a pretty good job in portraying their characters. I also liked the FBI agent played by Fred Ward. 2) The action sequences were actually quite good, the best part of the movie being the 'bridge' scene and of course, the end was exciting! 3) The locations were interesting, from imaginary places in the future and also some actual locations. But the disappointing part of the movie (which made it a 3 star movie for me) is because of the plot. The whole general plot and outline was a good one, interesting yet believable. But some parts of the story just didn't click or just seemed to be put there just as a filler. Also, not enough twists. By the middle of the movie you can guess what's going on and also guess what's going to happen. So as I said, the movie COULD have been better.
For another movie similar to this one, try ""The Fugitive"" with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones which was a terrific movie. A lot more violent but it had a better plot. For a good Keanu Reeves movie, ""The Matrix"" is the BEST and Rachel Weisz is also good in ""The Mummy"".
PG-13 rating because of some language and some violence.",1020384000,3,2338,4.555819477434679

Chain Reaction is packed full of great action sequences.  This film contains two of the best chase scenes I have ever seen and several great explosions.  All of the roles were perfectly cast especially Morgan Freeman.  The picture is perfect and the sound is great in DTS.  The DVD is however lacking in options.  It only contains trailers for Chain Reaction, Point Break, Unlawful Entry and Big Trouble In Little China.  All in all a good DVD at a decent price.",990489600,7,1010,4.6875

820762,4,6304259158,"""Chain Reaction,"" the high-octane action thriller from the director of ""The Fugitive,"" is a stunning setpiece for some of the most intense and high-speed action sequences that have ever graced a film of this genre. The suspense and movement throughout the movie is so well-crafted and inventive that is keeps the movie moving at nonstop full speed. But that's the one problem with it: this is really the only thing that keeps it moving. The story of conspiracy and deception does have a lot of intelligence to it, probably too much intelligence, which is why we never really get a full explanation of the events of the story in the end. But nonetheless, if you watch it enough, you'll figure it out for the rest while enjoying the action many times over.
On the outskirts of Chicago, a group of determined scientists is working on a new source of energy, which involves the burning of hydrogen and a highly complex system of keeping the source plentiful. Student machinist Eddie Kasalivich cracks the key in stabilizing the system, but the rejoicing of the group is short-lived when they project leader is murdered and and the laboratory is completely destroyed by a hydrogen explosion. As the FBI begins investigating, Eddie, along with partner Lily Sinclair, also begin picking up small clues which lead to their being framed for the crimes under investigation. As the detectives get closer to catching them, they run further, relying on help from project founder Paul Shannon, who really wants them in order to relearn the energy process for his own benefit.
There is such a high amount of intense action that the movie never stops moving, and we are willing to stick with it despite a few story flaws. Full of explosions, high-speed chases that involve not only motor vehicles but also a ski-boat on a frozen lake, and an on-foot chase sequence in a museum that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie never fails in giving us one piece of action after another, and this continues throughout the movie.
However, there are some glitches in the story that require repeated viewings in order to solve the entire puzzle. For instance, we never really get to understand the motives of Shannon and his partner, both of whom want the system and its plans for themselves. Why do they want it? For the money? For some other plan? Also, the dynamic of the relations between these two underworld people is never really given a chance to grow, and in the end, they go from agreeing on obtaining the system plans to arguing over whether or not they should dispose of Eddie and Lily. This sharp veer into their contrasts is just one of the unexplained aspects of the story, which feeds us a bit too much at times and tends of overload the circuits.
Nonetheless, if you are able to decifer the story in your first viewing, or you watch it repeatedly, you will find that it is smart, highly intelligent, and when figured out, the fast pace of the plot is quite admirable and enjoyable all in one. The movie is a terrific story of the old spin on who you are supposed to trust, and who is your enemy. Eddie and Lily are never in any real danger from Shannon; if they were to give him the plans, they would have no worries. His partner is the cutthroat of the two, and unlike his partner's easy-going attitude about his dealings, he takes a more serious and intimidated approach to his actions. There is also a small budding romance between Lily and Eddie, but it never gets in the way of the action, and helps it along when Eddie must rescue her.
The actors involved all work nicely in their roles, especially Morgan Freeman, who fits perfectly in the role. He plays Paul Shannon, and does so well in carrying out the mystery and unknown behind his character. Keanu Reeves pkays Eddie Kasalivich, and carries out the action with the same integrity and believability that he displayed in ""Speed."" This is a role he was born to play. Rachel Weisz plays Lily Sinclair, whose character is required to remain aloof and strong in certain moments during the movie. Weisz does this with terrific and powerful acting, and the chemistry between her and Keanu is very extreme but easily suppressible in the face of all that goes on throughout the movie.
There is a lot of good work put into ""Chain Reaction,"" despite its plot flaws and missing puzzle pieces. You'll find that you pay more attention to the action and surface story the first time around, and after that, you'll have more time to pay attention to the underlying story of conspiracy and deception. No matter what you may think, though, there is no denying that the action of this film is truly remarkable and innovative.",982627200,12,4671,4.669902912621359
