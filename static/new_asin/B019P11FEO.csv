8745622,5,B019P11FEO,Love it! Theres so much to learn and its very well taught by Irina. Just what Ive been searching for,1517443200,,100,4.05
8745623,4,B019P11FEO,"There are many great aspects to this program, including clear step by step instruction to complicated moves, such as foot patterns that are based on classical indian dance.  The instructor demonstrates the drills, and provides ample practice in all the key aspects of the choreography, such as hand gestures, arm movements, and drills that put all of the movements together.  BUT the soundtrack for the drills is repetitious, mechanical, and will definitely cause a hypnotic ear worm that will stay with you for hours, not good!  My husband appeared and commented how bad the music was, and said he couldn't get the sound out of his ears the day before when I was practicing.  Indian music is so complex and beautiful, I wish the instructor would have chosen something more complementary to the beautiful movements.",1510531200,2,815,5.014814814814815
8745624,5,B019P11FEO,"Irina Akulenko is a fabulous dancer.  Her movements are very precise, graceful, and well executed.  Her back up dancers are also quite good.  I like this video.  To learn the whole choreography, it will require some extra time in order to gain good control of the body.",1502841600,,269,4.659574468085107
8745625,5,B019P11FEO,I bought the DVD for my girlfriend because she was interested to learn belly dancing. She wants to perform for me.,1502582400,,114,4.476190476190476
8745626,5,B019P11FEO,Very nice.  Moves are elegant and precise.  This is a unique fusion style.  I enjoyed the instructor's creativity and stage presence.,1485561600,3,133,5.238095238095238
8745627,5,B019P11FEO,"I received the DVD promptly and have not yet completed it, but Irina is very thorough and beautiful to watch. Her moves are very exact and informative at the same time looking very natural to her. Thank you",1481932800,5,206,4.447368421052632
8745628,5,B019P11FEO,"This is a more ADVANCED dance video of very old-form, beautiful India dance (not Bollywood style). I'm not a dancer, so I had to repeat it a lot to learn the moves (and I still look like a duck, not a beautiful swan). My much more talented daughter, however, picked the moves up quickly. I wish I could look that good dancing these! :-) [*envy*] I shall just have to keep practicing. There is a more entry-level 'Bollywood Dance for Beginners' put out by this same video production company that is more suited to my clutziness and lack of grace. Sooo... If you have a bit of talent, this video will teach you some beautiful advanced techniques. If you're totally untalented like me, start with the beginner video and then move your way up to this one.",1471737600,5,751,4.489051094890511
8745629,5,B019P11FEO,I viewed this online before I bought it and was not dissappointed . She is an excellent instructor and dancer and the overall learning experiance is what I hoped for.,1457913600,7,166,4.566666666666666
