6412899,4,B00KB3PZAQ,"Some mildly negative things first:
1. I was hoping to see more comedy by Arale and Dr. Senbei, but the movies (perhaps naturally) lean heavily toward action sequences (e.g. spaceship battles, a grand prix race, etc). I got a bit disappointed about that.
2. The movies themselves are somewhat dated too (they came out in '80s). While the transfer quaility is good, the source material doesn't look better than TV episodes.

All that being said, if you're a Dr. Slump fan you should consider getting it. Arale will say hoyoyo and n'cha lots of times and you'll never get tired of it.",1412121600,7,581,4.696078431372549
6412900,5,B00KB3PZAQ,"...assuming they like nonsense, crazy situations and characters, and a fair bit of toilet humor, and are cool with reading subtitles. The transfer's great-looking, the voice work is excellent and humorous - if you like goofy humor this is a must-buy.",1407888000,4,250,5.121951219512195

On your left you can see a video sample of the audio of this set, though since Amazon compresses the picture quality it's not possible to show it at its best but I'll leave screenshots on the comment section. Also, I've added photos of the packaging on Amazon's Gallery Section.

Please support this release if you would like to see more Dr. Slump release, that being also, Vol. 2 of The Movies (6-11) and the 80's series. *fingers crossed it'll be successful*",1407283200,23,1915,5.568965517241379

Looks good on my Blu Ray player, but I wish that a 1080p remaster happens soon

Please release the series on DVD as well!",1522281600,,250,3.8823529411764706
8657173,5,B00KB3PZAQ,Akira Toriyama funniest anime ever. First movie make me laughed so much. Thank you Mr. Toriyama for making Dr. Slump.,1520294400,,117,4.9
8657174,3,B00KB3PZAQ,"It is nice to see the animated Dr Slump have a release in America. That having been said, this show isn't for everyone. Some will love the sheer insanity and creativity and potty humor, while it won't be others' cup of tea. Personally, I was entertained by these films but can't say they're must-see.

Hello! Wonder Island- 3 stars. Feels the most like an episode of the show. Also the shortest at 25 min. I like how it manages to maintain a lot of the sight gags from the strip/show. But there isn't anything that really sets it apart either. Probably my least favorite. It's just a short, fun romp.

""Hoyoyo!"" Space Adventure- 3 stars. See my review on IMDB.

Hoyoyo, Great Round-the-World Race- 3 stars. It's basically wacky races and that's okay. The gags and fun locales work here. I find the racing plot to be a nice change of pace.

Hoyoyo! The Treasure of Nanaba Castle- 3 1/2 stars. My personal favorite. Has the most story to it. It takes place in an alternate reality in depression-era Japan, which really works for the film actually. The main characters all fit really into the plot. I've heard some complain that the films were too action heavy, but I think that really works when you want the films to separate themselves for the show. This is like an Indiana Jones action film and it is just a lot of fun.

Hoyoyo! City of Dreams, Mechapolis- 3 1/2 stars. My second favorite. This is the most recent film and the animation looks the best here. The entirety of the city of Mechapolis is creatively designed. And it's interesting to see the various scenarios the characters are put through as they see their wishes come true. Admittedly, there isn't a lot of plot, but it was so fun I didn't care.

Be forewarned: As a Westerner, I felt that a handful of jokes were kind of creepy.

Overall, I enjoyed the films but can't say they're must-see.",1488585600,,1856,4.522388059701493

8657177,5,B00KB3PZAQ,"I love Dr Slump, I actually got into it just recently. Of course compliments of J-stars did I become familiar with Arale but after watching some episodes of the series I must say I am genuinely entertained. I received this movie the other day and I still have yet to watch the whole thing. Its very funny and entertaining even though its a bit juvenile. I would almost recommend it for small children if it wasn't Japanese language English subtitle only but hey, you never know (: I think 10+ is a good recommendation in that area. Otherwise support Dr Slump that way we can get more DVD releases everyone (:",1469059200,,608,4.486486486486487
