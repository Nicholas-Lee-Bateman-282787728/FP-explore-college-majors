7986216,3,B00008PBZB,"A gritty, grindhouse jungle flick banking off of Raiders of the Lost Ark's marketing. I wish the video quality was better than a 4th generation vhs copy but still there's enough meaty entertainment to make this a fun watch, even outside of the hilariously bad movie deaths. Laura Gemser, in a scene created for her unabashed Emmanuelle nudity dies skinny dipping because? lol 3.5 Donuts out of 5.",1523145600,,396,4.838235294117647
7986217,1,B00008PBZB,Not much going for this movie outside of being an insomnia cure. Only enjoyable if you like seeing people get stabbed with fake spears or are extremely hard up to see a naked woman.,1508112000,,181,4.352941176470588
7986218,5,B00008PBZB,Excellent.,1409702400,,10,10.0
7986219,2,B00008PBZB,"THe movie itself is fair, but Laura Gemser(the reason I bought said DVD and covergirl) is barely in the movie. She only has one brief nude scene and it only shows her butt briefly. Only good for collectors like myself.

And yeah, the movie seems pretty cut to me as well.",1216512000,10,271,4.313725490196078
7986220,1,B00008PBZB,"On the cover of this DVD release, it is advertised as ""Raw and Uncut"". However I don't believe this is the original uncut version. Some scenes have been cut from the movie from what I can remember of the old VHS version.  The DVD transfer is farily poor. Also there are no DVD extras on the disc.",1079654400,13,296,4.192982456140351
