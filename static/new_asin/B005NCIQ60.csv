8480317,5,B005NCIQ60,"IDENTIFY ABSENCES: 3 Things Missing in Flat and Declining Churches is a wonderful teaching about the important elements missing in our church as a whole today.  The point that stood out most to me was when Dick said ""[pastors] must talk and teach about prayer all the time"".  The Bible commands us to pray, it's our most effective mode of communication with God.  How then can we expect to pastor, teach, preach, or disciple effectively without it?  Furthermore the people need to understand prayer isn't just relegated to a particular group of women or men--it's for everyone.  Dick drives this point home.
