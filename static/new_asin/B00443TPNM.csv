8415790,5,B00443TPNM,"Makes me think I could do this other than some rattle-can bike painting 40 years ago and some very amateurish body work that looked terrible, this is foreign territory for me, but like his other videos this is scripted for the weekender in his garage  like has been mentioned he assumes you know which end of a spray gun to grab and that your shop has the required compressor, etc.  But otherwise he doesnt assume much knowledge on the part of the viewer and that is refreshing

This is not a polished cable-TV video (you know the kind  lots of glitz, little substance), but rather one that is worth backing up in spots to gather all the detail. Tips and tricks he offers (right down to the proper way to pour from a can).  Good stuff, less expensive than most and packed with useful tidbits as well as occasional theory but all designed for the weekend hack in his home garage.",1445472000,,878,4.428571428571429
8415791,5,B00443TPNM,"Excellent and in-depth DVD, except it assumes you know how to set up and use a paint gun.  Well worth the price.",1442102400,,112,4.090909090909091
8415792,5,B00443TPNM,"Very good video. Lots of good tips on getting a quality paint job. He assumes you know how a spray gun works, and you should have a compressor and gun already. Also shows you how to make welded stands so you don't have to hold parts in your hands. You'll need a MIG.

Price is good.",1386892800,,282,4.035714285714286
