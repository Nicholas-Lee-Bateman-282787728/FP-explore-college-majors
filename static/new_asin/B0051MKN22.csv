8452934,1,B0051MKN22,"This is the second one I have purchased. The first one i ordered i did not realize that it was from Europe. Needless to say it did not play.
So I bought this one. About a quarter of the way through the picture started freezing. I thought it was my DVD unit so I bought a cleaner and that didn't work either. I have put many DVD's in since then and they work just fine. I guess I'm not destined to have this movie.",1363046400,,413,3.9285714285714284

8452937,5,B0051MKN22,"""Hello, Dolly"" is one of my favorite Streisand films.  I just LOVE ""Love is only Love"" and her version of ""Hello, Dolly."" A young Tommy Tune and Michael Crawford as Ambrose and Cornelius are also a delightful surprise. And Julie Andrews is ALWAYS a delight! She may be one of the most talented singers who has ever lived!",1347580800,,321,4.5344827586206895
