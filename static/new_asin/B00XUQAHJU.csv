8716615,5,B00XUQAHJU,"This is an amazing movie -- David Oyelowo is a phenomenal actor -- I watched this 5 movie times when it was on cable and wanted to own it -- the performance is compelling and emotional - the script is amazing.  It's the story of a man descending into madness -- he's trying to cope with a life that is quickly unraveling.

One of the most compelling and spellbinding performances I've ever seen - I can't recommend it highly enough.

This one will move you and stay with you long after it's over.",1473811200,,496,4.311827956989247
8716616,5,B00XUQAHJU,"Now THATS a one man show! Great performance. Disturbing. Well directed, written, and acted.  I didn't know I could be captivated by a one man show until I saw LOCKE.  Then I saw this and was even more blown away. It's great some studios have the courage to make such unique films.",1457395200,,280,4.365384615384615
8716617,2,B00XUQAHJU,"Good storytelling reels you in by speaking to the human condition in such a way that you see yourself in the other person's circumstances. You don't have to be what they are (poor, rich, white, black, sick, drug addicted, mentally retarded, etc). You just have to have felt what they feel, and emotions are common to everyone. Nightingale never created that connection for me. I felt completely alienated from the only character. I never identified with him and never felt what he felt. I am not sure if it was the writing, the acting, or just the way it was all presented, but honestly, I fast forwarded through most of it. It was boring. I didn't care about him, his mother, his habit of filming himself, or any of it. When a film leaves you feeling, ""So what?"" it rates 1 to 2 stars. Since it's not the worst thing I've seen, I will be generous and give it 2.",1455840000,,862,4.39375

8716619,5,B00XUQAHJU,"I saw this on the HBO preview weekend recently, and it had me hooked from the beginning. The part of Peter Snowden is played so realistically by David Oyelowo. It was not sensationalized or made gory like so many movies are today. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but this is one ""artsy"" movie that I highly recommend. My only complaint was that the soundtrack listing at the end was so small that I couldn't read most of it, and it had some really great old music like ""Chances Are"" and ""The Good Life"". So I came to Amazon to try and find it and decided to do a review while I'm here. There is a summary at IMDB that offers some interesting insites. I also found it useful to have the closed captioning on in a couple of places.",1435622400,9,745,4.144827586206897
8716620,5,B00XUQAHJU,"From the austere beginning to the inexorable conclusion, one of the best films I've ever seen. Ever. Superlatives sufficient of David Oyelowo's laser sharp performance simply allude me. As they do for the writing and directing as well. David Oyelowo, Writer Frederick Mensch and Director Elliott Lester, both I, and no doubt the very gods of film themselves, salute you.",1434931200,8,370,5.183333333333334
