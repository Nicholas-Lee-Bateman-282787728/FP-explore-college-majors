8656675,3,B00K7P6UHK,"Backyard Ashes is a low budget Australian movie from 2013, which heavily uses stereotypes and recycles commonly told backyard jokes when making fun of mates, for it's characters to use in their backyard cricket games.  It doesn't contain the best acting in the world, most of the characters in this one are old men played by actors successful enough to make a living on various Australian TV shows who recycle the same actors over multiple decades, but who never made it big internationally.  If you're into cricket you might get more out of it than the casual viewer, but most of the cricket references are as I mentioned recycled jokes, and things kids in the school yard (or each others backyards) would call each other.  Some references such as ""Lilly"" might be a bit dated for younger viewers.  Of course if you're a viewer from outside of Australia, New Zealand or England, you probably haven't heard of any of these before so the movie might be slightly funnier, but probably a lot will also go over your head.  Maybe best to view this with someone from one of those three countries.

You don't need to enjoy cricket to enjoy this movie though.  I hate cricket myself, one of the only sports that is not just boring to watch but boring to play as well.  Of course the cricket in this film isn't the boring playing it as a sport version, it's basically just something to do while drinking (the other Australian backyard past time besides sport).  It's basically a two neighbours who share a fence dispute type film.  Followed through the point of view of the ""Aussie battler"" type long time resident who is approaching his retirement years as some sort of manual laborer in a factory, the movie is never really clear on what is produced there and what any of the cricket mates do.  His factory is facing closure and the larger British company that owns it has hired a man to cut the fat and make it profitable and more efficient.  Of course he is seen by the main character and the other workers who hang out in his backyard, drink and play cricket as an evil uncaring person (rather than the guy who is saving most of the their jobs) and when his mate and next door neighbour is layed off so the factory can survive, the main character unrealistically keeps his job after calling the new boss a number of names and telling him he'll get his in front of everyone else.  The out of work neighbour can't find any work locally so has to sell his house and move to Broken Hill.  Of course the new owner and next door neighbour is, the temporary boss and he doesn't want to hang out, drink beer and play cricket.  The new boss does however play cricket for the town's side, who are seen by the main character and his mates as wussy lemon squash drinking types.  To reinforce the non manly image the boss has a pet cat the he loves and carries around his own backyard cuddling it all the time.  To make matters worse, the main character kills that cat when playing cricket.  The boss doesn't believe it was an accident.  This is where the movie probably could have gone in  a better direction that made more sense, but after the mobile phone footage of the cat meeting its demise goes viral and hits the media, the town gets the idea that the two men and their mates will be playing each other to sort out their differences, and prove who is superior with the winning team captain keeping the cat's ashes, (if you're unaware in international cricket Australia plays England for a small urn full of cricket stump bail ashes).  Of course a large number of the town citizens turn up in the backyard to see this event, so the game is on!

The backyard mates actors (John Wood, Damian Callinan etc) do an adequate job, if you've seen them in something else they play similar characters and deliver the same level of acting standard. Felix Williamson who plays the younger boss doesn't do a bad job but the movie would have been better if we'd experienced more of the dispute and even the firing events that triggered the main character's attitude from his point of view too. The better acting and some of the better lines are delivered by the backyard wives but they only have a very minor role in the film, like with the boss the movie would have benefited from them have a larger percentage of the script time.  Backyard Cricket isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is entertaining enough to pass the time.",1454025600,,4409,4.504391468005019

It probably helps being Australian to appreciate this absolute gem of a movie but don't let that stop you from buying it. I can't say enough good things about this film, it's just one of those movies you really have to see. If you want to feel away from the world's worries for awhile grab hold of this film, sit back and enjoy, there's nothing not to like.",1412208000,,512,4.389473684210526
