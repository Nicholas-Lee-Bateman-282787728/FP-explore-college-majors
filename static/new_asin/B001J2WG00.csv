And seeing how it was in German anyway I sent it back on Oct. 15, 2009 & you received & signed for it on Oct. 17, 2009.  I've requested several times for the money to put back into my zccount.  If the money isn't returned within the next 48 hours I'll be contacting the BBB & will not be doing business with you again!!!!!!!!!!",1257724800,,410,4.0875
8311778,5,B001J2WG00,"When I first saw this movie I almost didn't want to, because of the whole Black house keeper moves in with a White family storyline. Gimme a break (pun intended Lol). I was pleasantly surprised to find it was much more than the tired storyline I'd expected. I loved the friendship that developed between David and Clara. This was the first movie I saw of Whoopi Goldberg's (I think I was about 11 or 12 then), and I've been die-hard fan of hers ever since! I'm much older  now, and this still remains my favorite Whoopi Goldberg movie (and I've seen them all), and my favorite movie of all-time. I can't believe it's not available on region 1 DVD yet. To me this movie would be well worth my investment in a multi-regional DVD player.",1226966400,2,734,4.437037037037037
