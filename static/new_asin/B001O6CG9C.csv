8329740,5,B001O6CG9C,"Fantastic series of DVDs!  Read the product description for all of the topics covered, but I think it's a great mix of theory and practical application with excellent editing so you're not wasting time watching the painter switch brushes or any of that ""dead air"" stuff that's a little too common on these types of things.

My one complaint is that this was really hard to rip.  I don't pirate, but I don't have a DVD player anywhere near where paint.  So, I watch stuff on my tablet while I paint.  But, I eventually figured it out and now I can the instructor paint while I paint if I want.",1388016000,,592,4.345454545454546
8329741,5,B001O6CG9C,"I own a lot of the DVDs, this was my first and still by far the best. It covers everything. Paint metallic, TMP or NMM. Painting gems, colors, everything.",1383436800,,154,4.344827586206897
8329742,5,B001O6CG9C,"This primer on pewter/plastic miniature painting was very informative and I loved the mid to advanced level tutorials. Please don't think that it is only for advanced painters. Beginner painters will find themselves getting up to speed decidedly quicker and avoiding mistakes that would waste time and discourage them.  The chapter headings are clear and very easy to navigate.

 My only criticism is a constructive one should there be a 2nd edition. I would like to see a list of supplies somewhere rather than scattered throughout the tutorial but as problems go this is a minor quibble. Even in an age of online U tube tutorials this DVD set is worth purchasing for it's scope of techniques, accuracy of experience and advice and easy navigation.

 All in all a great way to bring a newby up to speed or polish up on techniques.",1378252800,2,831,4.783216783216783
8329743,5,B001O6CG9C,"I just wanted to quickly recommend the Hot Lead Miniature Painting DVD Set. The instruction was clear and well presented. The filming is clear and the close-ups do a great job showing detailed . I can honestly say I see improvement in my painting after only watching the first DVD.  I have viewed the other two on advanced techniques and they represent the same clear instruction. This is not flashy, but very user-friendly and well presented. I very happy with the product.",1346889600,3,474,4.780487804878049
8329744,5,B001O6CG9C,"Love this DVD set.

Contents is very comprehensive - construction, priming, painting, making bases, scenery, are all well covered.  Usually more than one approach is shown, and good and bad aspects of each are explained.  Techniques are very well described and illustrated.  The material is presented in a very easy to digest manner, very accessible to a complete novice.  Intermediate painters should also find many interesting topics.  There is less very advanced material.

Overall I found the material very interesting and easy to watch.  Two thumbs up!",1323388800,3,557,5.32183908045977
8329745,4,B001O6CG9C,"If you are new to modeling and painting this would be okay, but its more for person that has been painting for at least a year. If you have tome time under your belt this will take you to the next leavel, I can see this being a little bit overwhelming for a noob. If you are more of a baptism by fire kinda person swing away Im a 100% happy with it and watch it when ever I need motovation to paint.",1268784000,4,399,3.819277108433735
