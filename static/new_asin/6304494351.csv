891472,4,6304494351,"An unashamedly corny, romantic comedy/drama, ""Voices"" is a love story that women AND men can enjoy. The songs and score by the legendary Jimmy Webb are gorgeous--one of the best soundtracks of the 70's. Amazing  cast--Alex Rocco (""The Godfather""), Barry Miller  (""Fame"" ""Sat Night Fever"") and legendary acting  teachers Herbert  Berghoff and Lilia Skala enhance the earthy, surprisingly  beautiful cityscape this movie inhabits (shot entirely in Hoboken NJ, it  was the first film made in NJ since the silent era). Ontkean and Irving  definitely create sparks as the poor boy/rich girl couple.",948326400,4,593,5.380434782608695

VOICES: A singer and a deaf girl? A deaf dancer? Sounds like the kind of premises that cant help but turn either maudlin or ludicrous. But this heartfelt little film treads a tightrope of sincerity between these two unacceptable extremes, maintaining the high ground and a perfect balance, courtesy of the intense tenderness brought to the performances. Irving is angelic, beatific and serene, and proves her prowess as an actress by conveying every emotion, no matter how complex, with crystal clarity through the only tools Rosemarie can use: facial expressions and body language. Ontkean contributes a very real sense of gentleness and an almost tangible passion; in most scenes, he appears genuinely smitten.

Voices has one major problem, however: Its really only half a brilliant film. Weve actually discussed only one side of its story so far. The other part of the plot is the loud, extraneous tale of Drews family: three generations of men (including dad Alex Rocco) living together in a cramped Hoboken apartment, always on each others nerves and at each others throats. How this entirely unconnected, completely unrelated, grating and irritating tale ever attached itself like a leech onto such a delicate love story remains a mystery. But while taping just the love scenes off a cable broadcast, I discovered something very interesting: Except for one brief moment (Drew helping his family put out the fire in his fathers store, which makes him late for Rosemaries audition) the two plots *never intersect.* And so I pass on to you these instructions on how to watch Voices as a lovely romantic movie without having to endure the pitiable peripheral plotline: After the opening, merely fast scan through any scene that doesnt include Amy Irving. Its that simpleand you won't miss anything vital.

And its well worth the trouble going to these lengths to see the romance unfold. Irving is a mesmerizing mime; a delicate, balletic dancer; adorable and radiant, yet capable of instilling Rosemarie with a fierce independence. Her scene with Rosemaries overprotective mother is drama of the highest caliber: multi-leveled, smart and heartrending. Voices is a very enabling film, as wellone not about disability, but about the joyous expression of ability. The final scene is clever, unique, utterly original and spectacularly poignant. Drews dilemma is how to share his first love, music, with his hearing-impaired lover. He illustrates that love is indeed the universal language as he finds a way to close the gap thats separated them since they first laid eyes on one another from a distance. If that final scene doesnt burst your heart with poignant joy, there might be nothing on earth that can move you to tears. For all its peripheral flaws, Voices is ultimately a very moving moving picture.",1423008000,,3061,5.021653543307087

Burton Cummings, of Guess Who fame, has a great vocal range. There's even a song by Willie Nelson in the film for all you country fans. Aside from the music, the plot makes you feel good, and in spite of the cliche, theres nothing wrong with feeling good in these turbulant times, right?",1300320000,5,529,4.247524752475248

891713,3,6304494351,"I saw this movie when it first came out, I think it was 1979.  I loved it!  It was a bit slower than I remembered.  The reason I bought it was for the songs by Burton Cummings.  I actually wanted to buy the soundtrack but could not find it.  It is romantic, but takes too long getting to the point.",1287360000,,298,3.9

891716,4,6304494351,"I purchased this DVD for nostalgic reasons.  I saw it in the Spring of '79 on it's opening day on a double-bill with a film I've long since forgotten.  If there were five people in the audience that would have been alot.  I remember a couple of cute girls about my age sitting a few rows behind me getting weepy about the movie.  At that time I had the self-esteem of a doorknob so naturally I didn't approach them.  I digress for sure.  Bottom line, the film works as an affecting romance but falls short as family drama.  The love story between fledgling singer Michael Ontkean and aspiring hearing impaired dancer Amy Irving is palpable and touching.  Buyer beware because there are intermittent intrusions by Ontkean's annoying family.  Viveca Lindfors, however, has an effective turn as Irving's protective mother.  Not classic stuff but a good movie to watch when cuddled up to a loved one.",1247270400,3,896,4.72258064516129
891717,5,6304494351,"Yes, ""Voices"" is a love story, but it's not a glittery fairy tale in the style of current romantic films. Rather it's about the romance one can find in reality. It's the story of two ordinary residents of the gritty working class city of Hoboken, NJ who lived in two different worlds.

Drew Rithman, (Ontkean) is a truck driver who dreamed of becoming a rock star. Rosemarie Lemon, (Irving) was a teacher from an overprotective upper middle class family. She longed to become a professional dancer. Both of them had families who constantly discouraged them and tried to hold them back at every turn. Both felt very misunderstood by their families and friends.

If they had followed the 'rules' of their families, Drew and Rosemarie would've never met. Yet, the two people did meet each other. They got to know each other and they eventually discovered that despite their different lives, they had common ground, and that despite the lack of support from their families, they could still be happy together and still encourage each other to achieve whatever it is they wanted.

All of the actors did a fine job, but Irving's performance really stands out in this specific film. She had very little dialogue but her expressions and movements spoke volumes.

Unfortunately, the late 1970s and early 1980s were not the best years for romantic movies at the cinema. It just wasn't the general public's taste, and critic seemed to absolutely despise the genre. In fact, the New York Times did its very best to bury this film with a very cynical and condescendingly negative review. Other critics reviews were mixed. Truth of the matter is that it Voices was considered a box office failure.

However, in the opinion of this movie enthusiast, ""Voices"" was a wonderful movie that succeeds in touching the hearts of those viewers of independent thinking who don't or won't blindly accept the opinions of professional movie critics like just so many sheep. As far as I'm concerned, Voices didn't get half the attention it should've received back in 1979.

Despite the reviewers calling it ""so-so"" and ""predictable"", to me wasn't wasn't just another sappy run-of-the-mill Romeo and Juliet style chick flick.  The first time I saw Voices, it was clear to me that this movie was done with heart and passion, and really seemed more like an art film than a commercial release.  In fact, when ""Voices"" was released to theatres back in the Spring of 1979, it was considered by some people to be a very important 'breakthrough' movie.

What made ""Voices"" so special and different than other movies in the romance genre?

Well, Rosemarie, the female protagonist in this movie, was hearing impaired, and in those days few if any movies featured people with disabilities in romantic roles! Looking back, it's hard to believe that there was actually a time when people actually had the kind of misconceptions of disabled person that Voices addressed, but they did. Some honestly believed that deaf people could not become dancers, or do anything but be deaf! In fact, 30 years ago the term ""deaf"" and ""dumb"" (implying stupid rather than not being able to speak) was synonymous...and a considerable number of people were still being institutionalized instead of remaining in the mainstream.  I can still remember how people told ""Helen Keller"" jokes back then...that's how ignorant people were about deaf culture back then.

Voices"" was one of several films that was instrumental in debunking the myth that deaf people were unintelligent or incapable of having talents and skills...or that it was a bad idea for them to be romantically involved with anyone, hearing or deaf. This movie, at that time, was one of the first full length feature films to demonstrate that people with disabilities in general (and hearing impaired people in particular) can still live full, happy normal romantic lives...and that with loving and supportive people in their lives, they can still go for their dreams and do most if not all the things that abled bodied people do.

Yet, this movie also had its bit of controversy, too...from the deaf community itself!

According to a 1991 book on American Sign Language published by Galluadet University press, there were a number of deaf actors who were very upset that a hearing actor, Amy Irving was selected over a deaf actor for the role of Rosemarie Lemon. Despite the fact that Amy understands ASL, has a credible ""deaf speaking voice"" and has a deaf sister who taught at a school for the deaf, the actors disagreed with her being casted in the movie. They saw it as discrimination.

In fact, some of those actors formed a group called ""Coalition Against Voices"" and protested at the San Francisco premiere of the film, not so much to encourage a boycott of ""Voices"" but to make the powers that be in the film industry aware of their existence and of the discrimination that deaf people faced each day! Because of the demonstration, MGM made the promise to use more deaf actors in future films...that promised helped to pave the way for many hearing impaired actors, including actors like Marlee Matlin whom you may remember in her Oscar winning role in the 1986 film ""Children Of A Lesser God."" It's interesting when you consider that Matlin went on to compete in the reality show ""Dancing With The Stars"" in 2008. She accomplished in real life what some people back in the 70s would have said was ""impossible!""

At any rate, I always felt this movie had a positive and empowering message for both hearing and hearing impaired alike.

Something else I love about this film? The theme song! The theme song can often determine the success or failure of a romantic film...and to me ""I Will Always Wait For You"" is the perfect song for demonstrating the love between Drew and Rosemarie, and also describing their promise to each other to be there for each other, to make time for each other, and to be supportive of each others goals and dreams. This lovely song was penned by prolific songwriter Jimmy Webb and sung by former Guess Who member Burton Cummings.

I know this film is difficult to find, but if anyone has the opportunity to view this very special movie in this year, the 30th anniversary since its release, they really should do so.",1239408000,5,6252,4.84348641049672
