1467173,5,B00005JLZW,"and very re-watchable. If you enjoy witty fast-paced humor and the Day-Hudson oeuvre, then this is a film worth owning a copy of. The entire cast seems to be having a ball and the director has had a field day filling the screen with luscious 'technicolor' and an endless array of sly hilarious sight/set gags (e.g. an impossible view of Manhattan that'll make any New Yorker laugh out loud). The soundtrack will keep you humming all day long (kudos to newcomer Michael Buble who provides some of the vocal stylings). This is a 'send-up' in every sense of the phrase and will have you chuckling and feeling good from the first ""reel"" to the last!",1059955200,2,645,4.6173913043478265
1467174,2,B00005JLZW,"This is a modern revamp of ""Boomerang"" starring Eddie Murphy.  The movie questions what happens to the guys when they are at the wrong end of the stick.  The set is based upon the Swinging 60's ""Doris Day & Rod Hudson""s era.  The costume worn in this movie is ever-changing & proves to be the highlight of the movie.  Ewan & Renee are rather clinical in their appearance, perhaps deliberately as the Director attempts to achieve the cartoon, ""Jetson""s look.  I can't help but noticing that almost all the cast in this movie is from TV series such as Frasiers, Jack & Jill, Boston High.  Still, the cast doesn't disappoint & manages to hold up their own against the high calibre & highly paid Ewan & Renee.  Quite pedestrian, if you ask me & something to watch on a rainy day.  I wouldn't have watched it if I weren't few thousand feet trapped in the airplane en-route to Sydney from Christchurch to catch the Bledisloe Rugby Match between All Blacks & Wallabies, which we managed to trounced them convincingly seven tries to three!  Anyway, that's another story...",1059609600,2,1064,4.647058823529412
1467175,3,B00005JLZW,"What FAR FROM HEAVEN was to Douglas Sirk, DOWN WITH LOVE is for Doris & Rock.  Renee is Doris.  Ewan is Rock.  Even David Hyde Pierce shows up to play Tony Randall.  Even Tony Randall shows up to play the publishing mogul.  Since everyone is here, let the chase begin.
The time is 1962 and Renee is a Maine Librarian that comes to NY to publish a book about how women don't need men.  Love is really a trap.  Instead they should learn to be like men and enjoy the act without the attachment.  Ewan plays the playboy reporter who gets around.  The publishing and sensation of Renee's book makes it impossible for Ewan to get any action so he decides to seduce Renee.  This will prove that Renee can fall in love and that the whole thing is a sham.  In many ways you've seen it all before, but in many ways you've never seen it like this.
The great fun of the movie is that the messages about women standing up are so old that they are played for great comedy.  The movie doesn't aspire to any sort of seriousness and therefore the ""message"" is really just the obstacle to what the characters really want.  What do they want?  The same traditional thing as everyone else while it looks as though they are new and enlightened people.  Renee wants Ewan, and Ewan wants Renee.
I felt that the movie was great fun in that it captured the style as well as Far From Heaven captured its style, but it didn't have any messages to ram down your larynx so you were free to enjoy the romp.  The ending may have been a bit much.  Instead of ending the conventional way they gave it an extra twist that seemed tacked on.  The last shot was genius in its silliness.",1058659200,2,1649,4.264516129032258

1467610,4,B00005JLZW,"It often comes as a shock to modern audiences that Doris Day and Rock Hudson made only three movies together:  Pillow Talk (1959), Lover Come Back (1962), and Send Me No Flowers (1964), and even at that the last movie barely qualifies as the stud-in-search-of-virgin, because the two are married and living in suburban California.  DOWN WITH LOVE is a perky 2003 confection that is both a tribute to, and send-up of, the first two Day/Hudson vehicles.  Set in New York City in 1962, Ewan McGregor is a globe-trotting, sexoholic journalist for a men's magazine.  He can't help but tangle with Renee Zellweger's character, who plays a young woman ""just off the train"" from Maine who has written a potential blockbuster called DOWN WITH LOVE, which promises to do for single girls what Helen Gurley Brown's SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL did for real.  Comic sparks ensue, including a false-identity subterfuge much like Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back, abetted by the hysteria of David Hyde Pierce, who plays to perfection the ""Tony Randall"" role from the original Day/Hudson pictures  (the REAL Tony Randall has a cute cameo).

On the whole DOWN WITH LOVE is a perky, enjoyable comedy festival.  My only complaints are that it is almost TOO perky, as the two principals try, and try again, to be cute and lovable, and somewhat overdo that approach.  When the real Rock Hudson was cast in Pillow Talk, he'd never made a sex comedy before and was advised to play comedy like ""the most serious thing in the world.""  Hudson did indeed play comedy as tragedy, and the results are more than funny.  Zellweger and McGregor are always ""on,"" and at movie length this extra perkiness, somewhat in the manner of an SNL parody, begins to weigh heavily.  Similarly, the set design, which often strains for colorful and winds up garish, is at times a bit too much, as are the frequent lapses into early-Sixties jazz and rock'n'roll.  DOWN WITH LOVE is enjoyable, but like most parodies, it is no classic.",1458864000,5,1982,4.777126099706745
1467611,2,B00005JLZW,It was kind of funky. More of a play than a movie.,1456876800,,50,3.25
1467612,3,B00005JLZW,"Down With Love is one of those movies that you get super excited to see again because all you remember is how good Ewan McGregor looked in it and the style of the film. Halfway through it's everything you ever wanted, lowkey feminism, Ewan McGregor looking hot as hell, more feminism, etc. But by the end of the movie, you're thrown through a loop-- what the hell is happening to this plot? Who is she? What did she do??? WHAT ARE THEY DOING??? and finally the movie ends and you feel like you've been punched in the face because you were so excited to watch this stylistic feminist film with Ewan McGregor and instead you get some weird M. Night Shyamalan rom com twist and you're left sitting on your ass wondering what just happened...

Overall still 3/5 stars because Ewan McGregor looks good af.",1456876800,5,800,4.517241379310345

(He was usually in the role played by David Pierce-- the neurotic, luckless-in-love sidekick.)

David Hyde-White does a terrific send up of the character Tony Randall always played.  Tony Randall is in the film in a token roll as a nod to the old films.  I also loved the fashions (being a girl ),and they are perfect for the setting of the '60's.

Down with Love is a fun spoof of the 1950s movie Pillow Talk with Doris Day and Rock Hudson.  This is the battle of the sexes royal, with Renee Zellweger playing a feminist author name Barbara Novak and Ewan McGregor playing a chauvinistic bachelor, Cather Block, who wrote the book on seducing women.

Barbara wrote an international  best selling book titled ""Down with Love"", which instructs women how to succeed in careers and have open sexual relationships just like a man.  As the book's success grows and women begin to take the upper hand in the sexual wars, Cather vows to expose Barbara.

Can Catcher entice Barbara into loving him?  Can he make her admit that women only want a husband and children?  Can Barbara survive Catcher's plot and maintain her sexual dominance over men?  Only the writers know.

Down with Love is a romantic comedy full of innuendo and repartee.  Dialogue like ""I knew that you knew that I knew you knew,"" abound.  Love tactics of men and women are openly exposed and exaggerated.  Most scenes are funny.

I recommend watching the film for good entertainment.  Watch out for the slap stick.",1322784000,2,1129,4.747422680412371

I Was hoping for more Ewan vocals but had to wait for the credits for this treat. Renee dresses beautifully for the period but several lighting situations were extremely unflattering, DP needed better feedback!

1468623,5,B00005JLZW,"If you are like me and grew up being dragged to Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies by your parents, then this parody of such films might appeal to you. One such movie that comes to mind is ""Lover Come Back"".  Renee Zellweger is dead-on as the proto/pseudo-feminist heroine who has authored a book exhorting women to cast away their previous lives as slaves to men and romantic love.  Ewan McGregor is equally good as the suave playboy and man about town who has taken on the secret mission to turn her world upside down by romancing her while posing as a somewhat geeky southern boy astronaut.  Additional fun is added by David Hyde Pierce who plays the hero's best friend in a role that used to be reserved for Tony Randall.  Tony Randall, in turn, ends up playing the role of the grand old man who all but orders McGregor's character to engage in this amusing charade.",1308355200,,864,4.519230769230769

The film itself is an homage to - not a satire of or parody of - those early 1960s romance-that-almost-missed flicks.  And Rene Zellweger is at her best.  Wait until you see the minutes-long soliloquy she has near the end.  It is (supposedly) a single shot.  How she does it - and McGregor's reaction - are awesome.

1468627,3,B00005JLZW,"The Bottom Line:

Down with Love was assembled with great care and the two leads (particularly McGregor) are very good in their roles, but the film suffers the main problem endemic to almost all screwball comedies--the characters are all so ridiculous that the audience doesn't give a hoot about what happens to them--and so I can't really recommend it; it's a fun film, but it's very lightweight and an agonizingly long speech by Zellweger in the third act that slows the film down to a crawl doesn't much help matters.

Renee Zellwegger is a charmer of the first water....a girl I will officially dub right here and now as: ""The Smirk"". Her cute ways, (and those lawd-awmighty gams!) have you fascinated with her through the entire film. Director Peyton Reed, (who looks NOTHING like I expected him to look,) must have seen ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Lover Come Back"" a thousand times, because he has the feel and timing of those two movies, (basically the same film,) down to a science! Renee's Barbara Novak, a feminist author new to the big city, hates the very idea of a Catcher Block, a classic rom-com movie batchelor who makes Hugh Hefner look like he uses saltpeter, or so we're led to believe. Catcher is a well-known SWM hedonistic journalist of the early sixties for a Playboy/Esquire-type magazine called ""Know"". Between the end of the film and her initial entry into the movie, Babsy actually MEETS Catcher,  disguised as someone else, and, as a matter of fact, falls for him rather heavily. At the last minute, his cover is blown and....

Well, the art direction is first-rate here, as someone managed to duplicate the look and feel of early sixties modern in every set in the flick! Sarah Paulson and David Hyde-Pierce make a VERY hard-to-believe couple in the film, but Paulson is as cute as ever. There is one split-screen scene here that is HILARIOUS and very naughty, between Zellwegger and McGregor and an O. Henry twist at the end that will have your jaw dropping!

Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor make for attractive leads and David Hyde-Pierce is simply stupendous in the Tony Randall part(Randall does a cameo here).  There's a certain wit to the script and some clever double entendres present that wouldn't have been allowed in the earlier films.  I can't give the flick the pass because the art direction-costume design is the height of garishness.  Now I wasn't born until '63 but I've seen enough films from the era to state that the film's vomit inducing look is an act of self-indulgence.

They both pull off this innuendo rich, tongue in cheek, vibrant comedy.  It is a play on the 60's romantic comedies of switched identities, and falling in love under false pretenses.

It is Doris Day and Rock Hudson in hyperbole!  It captures every nuance of every DD and RH film plot.  It makes fun of the films but in a respectful way, not putting them down but almost as a comedic homage to the characters.  The sets are outrageously stunning as are the costumes.  Doris Day could wear bold and beautiful outfits and no one thought twice about her turbans or cape-like coats, and this film captures that stylistic flair.  And her all white outfit from Pillow Talk makes a return in this film.

I wasn't sure about Ewan McGregor in this role, but boy was he more than great.  The choreography and presentation was spot on and contributed to the pace of the film.

Anyone could enjoy this movie, but Doris Day/Rock Hudson fanatics will catch every subtle reference and characteristic that has been personified in Down with Love.  Refreshing and engaging, it is a light hearted film but not at all simplistic in its presentation or message.

This is definitely a keeper!",1244764800,2,1315,4.656521739130435

Many speak of this movie as an homage to the Doris Day movies which it definitely worships and adores, but in actuality this film is closer in all ways to it's direct predecessor, a delightful 1964 movie called Sex and the Single Girl, starring Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis.  A little remembered cinematic gem.  The plot of DWL mirrors SATSG, right down to the female lead having penned a how-to manual for the modern (1964) single woman, pre-women's lib, instructing women that they can have a modern sexual relationship without love just like the guys do!  Similarities are so close that the movie's are both named after these best-sellers, along with the hero-rake disguising himself as an innocent nebbish whilst really seeking to write an expose denouncing Natalie-Renee as just another girl who really just wants love and marriage. The similarities continue with the secondary couple getting madly and comedically entangled in these deceptions, and even the boardrooms and board members antics mirror one another in the 2 movies.  DWL is really just a more visually colorful remake of that older movie, but it is beautiful and funny and the leads are perfect and it works so beautifully.  On it's own.  But it is definitely a remade Sex and the Single Girl.  For fun, I highly recommend the older movie along with this one. If only to see 2 legendary and beautiful actors at work, and if only to observe that they just do not make movie stars like the tragically luminous Natalie Wood and the magnetic Mr. Curtis anymore. Ewan and Renee are as close as we can get, and they are adorable and effervescent, with Ewan in particular shining in his comedic talents.  DWL is beautiful, colorful, the set design and costume design are Oscar-worthy, and this DWL is a treasure for those of us who love these types of movies.  When Ewan is in character as Zip Martin, he absolutely makes the screen come alive.  DWL is priceless, as is it's parent.",1232582400,,1976,4.7823529411764705

1468732,5,B00005JLZW,"When my sister, a Doris Day movie addict, told me I had to watch this with her, I didn't expect much. Once you've seen a Doris Day film, you've seen them all; couple this with the fact that I'm not a chick-flick kind of gal, and it's not surprising that I figured this was going to be a movie I would politely watch and then promptly forget.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

The world is a happy-go-lucky '60s joyride. Everything is a bright and colorful shade of ""optimistic,"" from the characters to the sets to the outfits to the very plot itself. The comedy is refreshingly direct, clever, and sharp. Renee Zellweger pulls off the most perfect Doris Day impersonation I've ever seen -- down to the walk, the face, the mannerisms, and the tone of voice. Ewan McGregor is not a very good Rock Hudson (he's too skinny and not very manly), but he's a serviceable love interest and, to my shock, he's actually a good actor. (After the sucky Star Wars prequels and The Island, I didn't have any expectations for him at all. It was a pleasant surprise.)

The humor is fabulous. It plays off of the common tropes in Doris Day films and laughs at sexism (without being preachy -- a feat in itself). It has its basic Doris Day-esque character types -- characters who are downright adorable and hilarious in and of themselves. The script is quick-witted and is delivered excellently by all actors involved. The result is a story that never lags and laughs that never stop.

The story is your standard romantic fare; again, if you've seen Doris Day, you know how things will turn out. You won't see the giant plot twist, however. I know I didn't. I sat there with my mouth hanging open.

I think the best part of this movie is its self-knowledge. It's not trying to be better than the Doris Day films of yesteryear. It's trying to satirize it, pay homage to it, and update it for a new generation, all at the same time. It succeeds in a fantastic way and never falls flat. The only thing I didn't like was the escalated sexual innuendo, but that's more up to taste. Frankly, the way they worked the innuendo in, I didn't know whether to be shocked or amazed at how cleverly they did it (as awful as that sounds!).

You know, after watching tons of poor and mediocre movies, this one was a welcome watch. It was even more of a welcome experience after the depressing recent events of this year -- it's a pure intravenous shot of happiness.

At least watch this movie once -- especially if you're a Doris Day aficionado or love romantic comedy. You'll find this a wonderful diversion.",1226275200,2,2575,4.489316239316239

Then the sheer genius of this work will really shine through. This is one of the few films that I can watch over and over again without ever growing tired or bored of it.

1468827,5,B00005JLZW,"I don't know if it's the cocktails that preceded or the `cocktail' that followed but watching `Down with Love' for the first time last night was such a treat.  I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor through and through and was at one time fascinated with the phenomenon that was Renee Zellweger and so it's a shame that it has taken me so long to finally see this film.  From McGregor's and Zellweger's stylized performances to the equally stylized set pieces and costumes `Down with Love' is a feast for the eyes and ears.  It's also quite the enjoyable ride.

The film takes place in 1962 and centers around a young up and coming author named Barbara Novak who has written her debut novel entitled `Down with Love', a how to guide for women wanting to make their way to the top of the predominantly male business world.  Novak moves to New York to promote her book and finds herself tangled in a web of lies and deceit with playboy Catcher Block.  You see Novak's book instructs women to cut off all ties with the fascination of `love' in order to focus completely on their advancement in the work field.  Determined to prove her a liar Catcher goes undercover as an astronaut named Zip in an effort to make Novak fall in love with him and thus prove her theory wrong.

This somewhat odd plotline would have never survived had it not been for the extremely entertaining performances by the entire cast and the delightful way the film is constructed.  The bright pinks, yellows and blues used throughout the film add so much to the intoxicating nature of the film, drawing the audience in with every entertaining frame.  Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger work off one another brilliantly.  In fact I think Zellweger's performance may be one of her zany finest next to her masterful Bridget Jones portrayal.  David Hyde Pierce and Sarah Paulson deliver superb supporting performances, all four of the actors truly understanding the idea behind the film not just in subject but in delivery as well and so they all contribute to the feel of creative feel of the film.  Rachel Dratch is hilarious here, but I only wish she had more to do.

`Down with Love' is some of the most fun I've had sitting in front of the television set.  It's one long running innuendo (thus my opening sentence) in the vein of maybe `Austin Powers' but it's smarter than the `Powers' films for it has more than just funny going for it, it has style.",1196640000,,2411,4.574418604651163

Having said that, there are some moments which jar.. moments such as a telephone conversation in split screen which seems more inspired by Austin Powers than by Doris and Rock...

But the pace and style of acting keep the audience with a smile on their face, albeit a more knowing one than audiences in the 60's had.

Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger just do not seem up to the task of lifting performances from their predecessors, but still deserve plaudits for a noble attempt. The supporting cast on the other hand are spot on, particularly David Hyde-Pierce's turn as the boss - it may be a rerun of his Frasier character, but is all the better for it!

The backgrounds, the colours, the costumes, the rear projection techniques - all remind us that this is a comedy consciously marking out its territory as a 60's rom com, but the script and stars will keep you firmly in this decade as you watch it.

Womanizer Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) is determined to prove her wrong.

The movie look like a Day/Hudson movie right down to the fashions Zellweger wears, the VERY colorful sets, the obviously painted backdrops from penthouse apartments and the crappy back projection in cars. There's also a hysterical (and very dirty) use of split screen during a phone conversation between Zellweger and McGregor.

1469012,2,B00005JLZW,"One of the insipid films of 2003 is Down With Love, a fantastic disappointment given its star Ewan McGregor and the perennial too cute, Renee Zellweiger. That the film's hype intended to pay homage to fluffy 60s Hudson-Day film pablum was director Payton Reed's task, his film is much too light on substance.  The leads struggle through every scene with the exception of McGregor, who is more skilled with characterization than the overly lauded Zellweiger. She is neither comfortable to watch nor interesting in the role of a dainty spinster author with an axe to grind over the male penchant for bed hopping.

If one must find a reason to swaddled Ms. Z in clothes that scream retro-princess in pink, at least fatten the girl up so her skinny un-60s body type will match the furniture. The body movements of both actors are too modern for the era, their bodies too thin, too fit, too not 60s only underscore how faulty a films that attempt to recreate the past.

Another major fault is the lack of chemistry between McGregor's Catcher Block and Zellweiger's Barbara Novak. While one can see McGregor in the role of caddish playboy about town, he is too charming a boytoy and not sufficiently the cad while Zellweiger's Novak never approaches any form of character credibility. Only David Hyde Pierce appears to fit the role he is cast, the second fiddle to McGregor's ladies man, man's man, man about town. Hyde Pierce's nebbish presentation is however, retro Niles Crane, and we've seen him do this to perfection already. He brings nothing new to this kind of character.

Despite the studio publicity machine to draw attention to the idea that everything old is new again as an approach to the film's genre, Down With Love never succeeds in pulling off the impossible,e.g., making Renee Zellweiger seem interesting and competent on screen. The credit goes to the talented men of the film -- Ewan McGregor carries yet another minimally-talented Hollywood actress through basic acting 101, while Hyde Pierce gives a master lesson in comedy timing 201. Even the late Tony Randall playing a characterization of himself is more interesting.  What an unmitigated and horrific film mess and disappointment for fans of McGregor.

I'd echo the others who have said that everything after and including the monologue was atrocious and contrived.  Perhaps I was the only one who was surprised that they get together in the end.

1469016,1,B00005JLZW,"Just for the record I loved all three movies with Day/Hudson/Randall. They depicted the place and time in which they play with wonderful costumes (Ms. Day's wardrobe still dazzles me after so many decades) so well and teamed up some fine actors who simply worked great together. To compare these movies to DWL is like trying to compare apples with oranges, i.e. not possible!

Ewan McGreogor and Renee Zellweger may be able to sing but their portrayal of the main character can only be called wooden. And the dialog and story??!! I mean who writes something like that and what's even more puzzling why do they even bother to produce this? Having said all this I have to admit that it is not ALL bad. Up until the point where Barbara tells Catcher who she really is I thought the story was sort of OK (not good but OK). But Barbara's monolog? I mean, hello? How gullible do these movie people think we are to believe that we would ever buy that?

From that monolog onwards I didn't like the story at all. The only reason why this movie gets one star is because of the great soundtrack and the set and costumes. Would I buy this DVD? I think you know the answer to that one. And it's really too bad because this could have been really good. Try a little harder next time, OK? Just for the sake of all movie loving people out there!",1121990400,7,1329,4.376518218623482
1469017,5,B00005JLZW,"Okay, I'll admit it--I am unabashedly in love with this movie.  Yes, it's cheesy.  Yes, it's over-the-top.  Yes, the plot twists are a little on the unbelievable side.  But that's what makes it such a guilty pleasure for me.

Down With Love is a homage to the old Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies of the 60's, but it's worth watching on its own merits.  It's bright and colorful, the dialogue is fantastically witty, and it's just fun.  Ewan McGregor is especially charming and sexy in this film, Renee Zellweger is great, and David Hyde Pierce is hysterically funny as always.  And if you're a fan of Moulin Rouge or Chicago, there's a chance to see Renee and Ewan sing and dance together during the credits.

The DVD contains, among other things, a running commentary by director Peyton Reed, and a hilarious blooper reel that's worth the price of the DVD by itself.

Down With Love is definitely one of my favorite indulgences--perfect for curling up with a big bowl of ice cream and watching on a rainy night.",1116979200,5,1009,4.649717514124294
1469018,3,B00005JLZW,"Definitely watch ""Pillow Talk"" before you view ""Down with Love"".  The former is pure delight.  One would think the humor in a Doris Day-Rock Hudson sex comedy would be outdated by now, but to my surprise, it was not.",1114732800,3,216,4.512820512820513
1469019,3,B00005JLZW,"This was really kind of a dumb movie - I give it three stars because I like everybody else's performance except Renee Zellweger's and I thought the movie's plot to be a lame duck. (I thought it was a fluke that Renee's performance in Chicago was God-awful, but now, having seen this movie, I'm thinking otherwise....)

Usually retro movies are made to be nostalgic - as Aviator is nostalgic about Howard Hughes, Almost Famous reminisces on 70's rock and its scene, View from Top on the emergence of airlines. The only thing nostalgic in Down with Love is the battle of the sexes, which is not something I find myself wanting to be nostalgic about, also since it is still ongoing today. I think perhaps part of the reason they had this movie take place in the 60's (or is it the 50's?), is that most of the messages that it sends out are very disturbing and not applicable to today's modern day, at least I hope not - otherwise we have really not progressed. Some of these messages include: the only way to get a guy is to bleach your hair blonde; a way to get a playboy, that is, if you want a guy like that, is to be one yourself; marriage is the end-all-end-all for women - once married, they are set with life. These are very unintelligent and backward messages.

I also most definitely do not enjoy being manipulated in any plot whatsoever, being led to believe one thing and then to be thrown a twist out of the complete-utter-blue. I like to be given little hints along the way, which this movie could have easily done.

The costume design in this movie was horrific, most certainly the wardrobe designed for Renee. The signature piece as worn by Renee's character is a pink dress with a white collar that literally reaches up to her ears. That may be appropriate for a movie about space aliens, but not for a 50's/60's movie. Women back then most definitely did not have such big oversized collars that wavered anywhere near the vicinty of the ears. Maybe that is why Renee's hair was hanging down in a very unretro manner - to disguise how ridiculous the collar looked. Her hair and makeup were also equally off-key and not at all in tunes with the 60's vibe.

Finally, I didn't see anything creative about taking clips from other movies filmed in the 1960's and using them in this movie. If I want to see clips from other movies, I'll watch those other movies.

This is a below mediocre film, whose only saving grace would be Ewan McGregor's and Sarah Paulson's performances.",1113264000,3,2484,4.511111111111111
1469020,5,B00005JLZW,"This Film deserves more than 5 stars. It was unbelievably retro and I loved it. Imagine you are in 1962. You just started work in New York and you are clubbing every night with beatniks, and trendy magazine editors and journalists. The bright lights of a city fresh in mod culture glow around you as the hip sounds of jazz and retro-chic pop engulf you. Cigarettes are glamorous and your apartment is decked out in tailored funiture upholstered with navy blue and pink. Throw on your tweed jacket or pencil thin suits and join renee and ewan in this beautiful recreation of the era.

Here's some music that shares the same feeling as ""down with love"": michael buble(""down with love""-duet with holly palmer), emma bunton(new solo album-""free me"" shares the same early 60's sound and the video for ""maybe"" is just like watching the mod style of ""down with love"") and ewan mcGregor and Renee's duet at the end of the film ""here's to love"" (there is an amazing video on the dvd that goes with this song with the 2 actors/singers dancing around in a retro club).

I also liked: ""funny face"", ""moulin rouge"", ""pillow talk"", ""amelie"", ""chocolat"", ""you've got mail"" and ""french kiss""....",1111968000,4,1179,4.746341463414634

Sure the story is silly, but it's just fun. Renee and Ewan are perfect in their roles. I've never seen a Rock Hudson movie but I knew DWL was a throwback to the 60s.

1469090,2,B00005JLZW,"I was really hoping this 2003 movie would be great fun given the comic possibilities of resuscitating the spirit and look of the Ross Hunter-produced Doris Day-Rock Hudson movies from forty years ago. But the combination of its wink-wink archness and smug tone makes this movie feel more like a tribute to ""The Carol Burnett Show"" sketch version of those movies. Despite a bevy of arresting elements - a swinging soundtrack, elaborate set designs, colorful couture and eye-catching opening credits, the film is ultimately sunk by director Peyton Reed's presumptuous attitude that you will love it and get carried away with its excesses. I didn't and I wasn't. In fact, I was continually confused as to whether the movie was an homage, update or send-up of those innocently provocative comedies, as the tone fluctuates wildly from frivolous sex comedy to feminist tract. That's not to say there aren't any smart touches, for example, the period-authentic orchestra music by Marc Shaiman and the creative use of split screen, but even this latter technique is hampered by the overdone sexual innuendo. The plot seems to hang on the sole notion of pairing, un-pairing and re-pairing the two main characters - Barbara Novak, the author of a pre-feminist best-seller exhorting women to jettison love in favor of career and casual sex, and ace journalist-stud Catcher Block out to prove her wrong. And true movie trivialists will recognize the storyline as none of the Day-Hudson pairings but rather a derivative of Richard Quine's 1964 ""Sex and the Single Girl"" with Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis, which was by no means a masterpiece either but certainly funnier than this heavy-handed romp.

I don't think I fully appreciated the light comedy skills and honest charisma of Day and Hudson until I saw the strained efforts by the two leads here. Despite a willingness to glamorize herself in sixties pastiche fashion, Rene Zellweger is miscast as Novak, too self-conscious to be credible as a best-selling sex novelist and too brittle to carry off the more farcical moments. She cannot get herself into the right attitude for the period, instead going for silent-movie-style expressions and exaggerated gestures to convey her character's feelings. With her breathy delivery, her endless confessional in Block's girl-trap apartment toward the end is simply enervating. As the swinging, supposedly suave Block, McGregor seems slightly more adept at light comedy, but he is too slight in stature (Hudson would have completely epitomized the character's name), too Scottish and like Zellweger, too contemporary for the carefree lothario he's supposed to be. Sadly there is little real chemistry between them, and compounding the problem is Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake's coy, contrived screenplay. David Hyde Pierce is perfectly cast in the put-upon Tony Randall part, but his dozen years on ""Frasier"" and an almost identical turn in the Bette Midler vehicle, ""Isn't She Great?"" diminish the freshness of his performance here. Sarah Paulson is as good as she can be in the thankless, unctuous ""best friend"" role, and Randall himself shows up in a wasted cameo as the magazine's chairman of the board. Perhaps due to an exhaustion of visual invention, the story becomes increasingly talky as it lurches toward the faux-feminist fantasy ending. You know something is amiss when characters start explaining what's going on. Disappointing.",1111017600,5,3423,5.223636363636364

1469093,4,B00005JLZW,"It would be a bit hard to understand why someone would want to remake a Doris Day/Rock Hudson ""battle of the sexes"" comedy, but when you see DOWN WITH LOVE you realize how much fun it must have been for all concerned. The sets and costumes are marvelous (there are great color schemes), the Marc Shaiman score really swings, and the cast really seems to be having the time of their lives. Renee Zellweger continues to surprise with her versatility, and though she can't get as hilariously angry as Doris Day used to get in the same roles (no one could get mad like Doris Day), she brings a great deal of charm and vulnerability to her part. David Hyde Pierce exactly channels Tony Randall (who is also here in a small and welcome role), and Sarah Poulson uncannily recalls Paula Prentiss and Jane Fonda in their younger and kookier days. Only Ewan McGregor seems miscast: although superb at being a smooth operator, he doesn't have the physical presence nor the fundamental wholesomeness Rock Hudson used to bring to his Lothario parts. As a result, where Hudson used to make you feel he was fundamentally decent when he would inveigle Day with his lies, McGregor just seems like a snake. Fortunately he is redeeemed in the film's closing credits where he gets to sing with that marvelous voice of his. The film was not a popular success in theatrical release, mostly because the recreation of the early Sixties did not seem particularly relevant; it is a tremendous kick in the head, however, and well worth your time.",1107302400,2,1519,4.692883895131086
1469094,3,B00005JLZW,"Light and frothy is the game in this two-pack, containing ""Le Divorce"" and ""Down With Love."" Neither movie is very deep or innovative, and one of them is more a satire on French ethics than a comedy. However, they are both prettily filmed and moderately entertaining, with some excellent acting from all concerned.

In ""Down with Love,"" role-model feminist Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) has written a groundbreaking book for women: She advocates ""a la carte sex,"" and a focus on business rather than romance, which will give women new power in the world. It becomes an international bestseller. But after Novak gets revenge on womanizing man-about-town Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor), he decides to worm his way into her affections by pretending to be a naive astronaut...

As ""Le Divorce"" opens, hippie-esque Isabel Walker (Kate Hudson) is coming to Paris to look after her pregnant sister Roxy (Naomi Watts). But Isabel walks into the building just as her brother-in-law Charles-Henri (Melvil Poupaud) walks out -- for good. As the two wrangle over the custody of priceless art and their two kids (one still unborn), Isabel slips into a fling with Charles-Henri's sexy middle-aged uncle Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), while working for one of his former flings (Glenn Close).

What do these two movies have in common? Besides blondes, that is. Well, they're both very pretty. ""Down with Love"" shines with bright retro colors and over-the-top styles, reminiscent of those 1960s comedies that celebrated color. And ""Le Divorce"" sparkles with ""the city of light,"" beautiful architecture and beauty of all sorts.

The biggest difference between the two is that ""Down with Love"" is a homage comedy, harkening back to those Doris Day comedies of the 60s. It's also a romance. ""Le Divorce"" is more cynical about love and romance, recognizing that often they don't last, and taking a sharp look at the different morals and beliefs of different cultures.

Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger have excellent chemistry as the fiery feminist and the disrespecting charmer, both of whom need a few lessons. Kate Hudson doesn't get to do much except be perky in ""Le Divorce,"" but her costar Naomi Watts is exquisite as the pregnant, wronged wife. Her restrained tears and quiet grief are more eloquent than any scripted lines.

Viewers who enjoy color and light will undoubtedly enjoy the two-pack of ""Le Divorce"" and ""Down With Love."" As for those looking for fluffy romance and minor social satire, this also works.",1106784000,,2500,5.100244498777506
1469095,4,B00005JLZW,"If you can remember those old ""bedroom comedies"" - typified by the collaborations between Doris Day and Rock Hudson (Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back and Send Me No Flowers, which are reviewed here) - then you will immediately know what to expect from this film. Barbara Novak (Rene Zellweger) is a debutante novelist,who has created the titular book exhorting women to abstain from falling in love and to take control of their lives in order to find...equality with men (gasp!). Her immediate overnight success brings her into conflict with one Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor) - a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the popular men's magazine Know. He is a ladies man, a man's man and a self-made man. He is James Bond, Hugh Heffner and Simon Templar rolled into one. As the women of the world begin to shake off their servitude to men, Catcher sees it as his role to expose Novak as no more than a love-lorn woman, who just needs the love of a man to make her life truly worthwhile.

The cinematography in this movie is excellent. Very clever split-screen effects, painted canvas backdrops, stock footage and extensive CGI merge seamlessly (other than where intended) to provide a totally credible recreation of the hyper-real CinemaScope world of the early 1960s films. The set and costume design are Oscar-worthy. Every larger-than-life outfit positively leaps from the screen, with the men looking uniformly suave and the ladies frequently stunning in vivid primary colours and outrageous matching coats and hats galore.

The acting is flawless. Zellweger and McGregor are spot-on in the lead roles (and they certainly show plenty of chemistry). The two leads even manage to squeeze an accomplished song and dance routine into the picture - once again acquitting themselves well. They are supported admirably by a wittily cast Tony Randall (who appeared in each of the original Hudson/Day films) and a type-cast David Hyde Pierce (Frasier). The corny dialogue is delivered with verve and the farcical set-ups ooze Sixties style from every single frame. The over-orchestrated (but appropriate) score never lets up, and if you close your eyes, you could believe you are listening to one of the original movies from which this draws inspiration.

However, there is surely a reason ""they don't make 'em like this anymore"". That reason might be one of the following: the dialogue is corny, the humour is dated or that the basic plot is so unrepresentative of modern living that it just looks contrived. This doesn't make this a bad film, but it does limit its relevance to a modern cinema-going public. This film is in fact extremely well made - the costume and set design is flawless, the colours are magic, the evocation of a previous generation is spot-on. Like The Brady Bunch movies, for me at least, the film serves as nothing more than a technically proficient throwback. I admire the craft of this film tremendously; it is technically wonderful and director Peyton Reed (Bring It On) is to be commended for his attention to detail throughout. Sadly, I didn't actually get that much enjoyment from it...and isn't that what it's all supposed to be about? For fans of the Doris Day and Rock Hudson bedroom comedy genre, this will be a wonderful treat. To the rest of us, it is a curiosity worth applauding for its masterful recreation of the films of the 1960s - but is ultimately unsatisfying. Recommended for Day/Hudson fans and those who wish to see a clever recreation of a pass film genre that passed its expiry date around forty years ago.",1104796800,4,3547,4.918196994991653

Even the opening credits feature the classic 'Scope logo! The opening music credits were spot on. This should be a great time, I thought. Well, THAT JUST WASN'T THE CASE. This is a DISASTER and a SLAP IN THE FACE to anyone who was conned into thinking this would have the charm of the past. I do NOT fault Renee or Ewan. I believe that with a competent director, this really could have been screen magic, but no. Instead, we're treated to a MOCKERY of the genre.

1469098,5,B00005JLZW,"I found this movie to be very interesting.

Renee Zellweger plays Barbara Novak who wrote a book called Down With Love that does not get very much publicity because she is a woman in the 1960's. She is supposed to meet Catcher Block (ladys man, mans man, man about town) played by Ewan McGregor, but he never shows up because he is to busy entertaining his many female friends.

Several weeks go by and Down With Love is a hit the whole world over and Barbara Novak is famous. Catcher sees her on T.V blasting him as the worst kind of man, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of her. He will pretend to be somebody else so that he can write an exposee saying that the author of Down With Love really just wants what every other woman wants, love and comitment. He pretends to be southern man named Zipp Martin and they went on many dates. The day comes when Catcher thinks that he will have sex with her when things start to go wrong. First he finds out that her name really isn't Barbara Novak, its Nancy Brown and that the reason why she wrote Down with Love was because she was in love with him and wanted to get his attention.

All in all, a very good movie that is very funny",1101081600,,1182,4.130434782608695
1469138,4,B00005JLZW,"The film title 'Down with Love' comes from one famous pop song, and as this shows, the colorful film itself is an eye candy full of references to the early 60s.  It is a romantic comedy, sure, but the spirit with which the film is made is rather that of tongue-in-cheek comedy for those who know, directly or indiretctly, the good old days of Doris Day and Rock Hudson, or their comedies.

The leads are Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor.  Renee is a writer Barbara Novak coming to New York City in 1962, where she becomes an instant celebrity when her book, 'Down With Love,' was a bestseller.  In that book, she preaches: 'Do have sex; Do not fall in love.'  Considering the time, pretty progressive, isn't it?

But one guy, a handsome ladykiller didn't like it.  It is Ewan McGregor's Catcher Block, who was officially, and blatantly, and deservedly perhaps, humilated before the public when Barbara revealed a serect or two about him on TV.  Now it's time for revenge, but this time Catcher uses his charms to attract her, seduce her, and make her fall in love with her, disguing himself as astronaut from NASA.

So, as you see, the plot is contrived, and going to be more so as it goes on, so I refuse to write about it.  THE POINT IS, the film is more an homage to the 60s and its fashions, than a traditional romantic comedy.  The name of Novak (meaning Kim?) is one good example, and there are lots of cultural references to the time -- Ed Sullivan Show, the Space Age, the Cuba Crisis, and so on.  And many, many, colorful, gorgeous costumes you have seen in Hollywwod films with the name of, say, Edith Head.

So far, the film is clever, or too clever for some.  But there is one problem, and that is, THERE IS NO CHEMISTRY between the leading actors.  I know Renee Zellweger is a charming actress, and Ewan McGregor is very amiable (though the latter is slightly underrated among critics), but strangely, the love they talk about (and of course, they fell for each other for real) does not sound very real.  The sparks between Ewan and Nicole Kidman in 'Moulan ROuge' is nowhere to be seen.

So, see 'Down with Love' not as a romantic comedy; it's more effetive as a delightful homage paid to the era when JFK and Jackie were the talk of the people.  As such, it may entertain you.",1099440000,2,2292,4.4556354916067145
1469139,5,B00005JLZW,"This was the best.  It's quirky and odd; it really helps if you're familiar with the whole Doris Day/Rock Hudson genre.  The plot is lifted pretty closely from ""Pillow Talk"": loathesome playboy impersonates wholesome, genuine type and steals heart of single-and-loving-it career woman who happens to hate the loathesome playboy; mistaken identities and giggles abound.  Silly, frothy chick-flick?  Kinda. It's fun and very 1960-something.

The leads are delightful to watch.  Ewan MacGregor is getting more delish with every film.  Yum.",1099267200,,536,5.625
1469140,5,B00005JLZW,"If you're in the mood for an off-kilter Romantic Comedy, this just might be one for you.  It's an RC movie, 1960s style.  The movie, with all of its over-acting, theatre sets and mood gives off the feel of a play.

For some oddball reason, I think of this movie as the STAR WARS version of the battle of the sexes.  We have Ewan Mcgregor play the Darth Vader of male chauvinism, and he is played off against Renee Zelwegger as the Princess Leia of feminism.  The story takes place approximately a decade before the women's movement.

The film has a certain charm to it that is somewhat irresistible.  Like the best Romantic Comedies, it makes fun of both men & women with equal zeal.  Even better, sometimes you think it's making fun of one gender when it's actually taking pokes at the other.

If you're a Renee Zelwegger fan (and who isn't?) and you have an affection for zany RC DVDs, this one is an absolute must to add to your collection.  It's funny, thoughtful and turns the tables in ways you will not be inclined to expect.",1097452800,,1032,4.412698412698413
1469141,4,B00005JLZW,"Frame of mind is important when approaching this amusing movie. The roles of Barbara Novak & Catch Blocker are quite a departure from the stars' past roles.

Renee usually plays comedy as a hapless somewhat victimized girly-girl, at which she is very charming. But, because of this, I had a problem accepting her in the parts of this movie towards the latter half when she tries to portray the strong businesswoman. It appears her costumes were designed to support this aspect, and Ewan has obviously reined back his usual energy to help her out (if a fan of his, you know that. although he can choose to be quite charismatic even when it appears he's not doing anything, in scenes with other actors he is always supportive; very professional and generous in terms of trying to get the scene right with them and never egotistically trying to steal a scene.) But to me, those scenes still seem off-kilter, and Renee still can't sell it, so they don't quite work as well as the rest of the movie.

Surprisingly, if you watch Renee in the musical number she does with Ewan at the end, she is able to capture the look and feel of a strong, successful, confident woman far better while singing and dancing, matching Ewan in presence without a problem.  Both have great skills when it comes to utilizing their whole bodies for expression. However, Ewan has always been a master at  ""getting"" a scene with just enough facial & body expression needed. Renee needs more experience at broadening her expressive range, and there's no doubt she will!

Ewan captured his character more effortlessly, and it is actually the parts when he is playing at being a goofy dufus that was odd on first viewing. This again was due to memories of his past roles interfering. One has to approach each of his movies with an open mind, because he does choose a highly diverse range of roles, much more like a character actor, and yet he is a leading man and a star. He may be creating a whole new category of actor, which is a tribute to his love of the profession and rebel attitude towards the Hollywood mill.

What's great is to watch the specials on the DVD and see the actors, directors & designers having a ball creating the movie. It provides insight as to what they were trying to achieve and helps to clear away preconceived notions that might block full appreciation. I mean, when you've seen the gag reel that includes Ewan ""assisting"" Renee in a purple feathered outfit lay a huge glowing purple egg that lands with a reverberating ""bong"" on the metal flooring, then sashay out the nightclub door together in character without falling apart in laughter, how can you not enjoy re-watching this movie in a fresh light?

The costars, David Hyde Pierce & Sarah Paulson, who play Peter & Vicky are perfect--perhaps because they are both TV actors with the requisite acting techniques that translate well into the broad stylized form of acting from the 60's this movie is recapturing. They are hilarious in all their scenes together as well as with the stars. Tony Randall, an  icon from the 60's guest stars--a very nice touch.

The casting of every supporting part is excellent and you really do feel as if you are watching a movie made in the 60's. The big difference is that there is a present day flavor when it comes to some of the verbal and visual sexual jokes, which sometimes veers a little too crude to mesh with the rest of the styish movie, and can draw you out of the fantasy, but is ultimately hilarious because we get to see a little more of what the 60's audience was only able to imagine. The dialogue is pretty good, but not as snappy or witty as from some of the better movies of the past era.  The writers were lucky their actors are all so good that they could read ingredients from a box and hold our attention while making us laugh.

Some of the gripes about Ewan not being right as the Rock Hudson type character are because the critics didn't seem to realize that he was purposely cast against type, which was brilliant . The Rock characters were romantically idealized for the women of the 60's with the icky cad side greatly downplayed. In this movie, Ewan doesn't hold back in the overbearing obnoxiousness of real-life lotharios who know how to push the romantic buttons of countless hapless females, yet he manages to be irresitible, anyways.  Maybe it's all the times he's shirtless--he was asked to body train in order to further enhance his already well known sexy assets--and he looks great, sauntering like a lithe, predatory animal.

Renee is adorable and pert in mostly gorgeous outfits that show off her asets--although there are some hairdos, hats and a couple of gowns that are downright ugly, like drag queen cast-offs, and the makeup and lighting is unflattering at times for her--don't understand how that was allowed to happen. The boys are dashingly handsome in their beautifully cut clothes 100% of the time. Every other character's outfit is given obviously meticulous care to enhance the movie's look. The orchestrated music is as much a character as are the over-the-top sets.

It's a visual-aural dessert. Just enjoy it as such!",1096848000,3,5158,4.678807947019868

However, there's more to like than him. McGregor and Zellweger are terrific as well and display perfect comic timing in their scenes together. There's definitely no shortage of laughs here.

Reasons not to see this movie: Plot twists at the end of the movie are utterly ridiculous - but why get bogged down in something like that in a fluff movie like this.

Were they possibly more compromising than this? I find that hard to believe. Listen to me, Renee: I would watch you read the phone book. You would say, ""Bee removal service"" and crinkle your eyes and I would beat my own brains out for sheer joy. But Renee, this is not the phone book. And I think you know that. Why, Renee? WHY? WHY?

1469145,4,B00005JLZW,"I think the best way to watch this DVD is to watch the extras first! There's a great HBO  special about it, 8 wonderful production vignettes, bloopers, deleted scenes, and you can even see the music video in full screen~! (Which is a great because it's a perfect homage to early 60's style variety shows!).  Watching the extras first really revs you up for the movie and gets you in the right frame of mind.  The only dissapointment with the extras is that, surprisingly, they left out the original theatrical trailers! (Although you do see snippets of the trailers in the HBO special--you can still see the original trailer on downwithlove.com) (this is why I give it 4 stars)

 But on to the movie.  It's perfect eye candy, and if you're expecting the innocence of a Doris Day and Rock Hudson original, you'll be pleasantly shocked at how they took the genre one step further and added lots of modern blunt innuendo.  It's still fun, but you know you'd never hear Doris Day utter the 'B' word.  Indeed, even the variety number at the end (that looks exactly like something straight out of Ed sullivan) is sung like a swinging Sinatra number, but if you listen to the lyrics, it's very risque!

 Yes, there is a lot of double entendrees in this movie, and they even take the most sacred of the Pillow Take cliches, the split screen effect, and turn it into, at one point, well...the most literal interpretation of the expression 'phone sex'.  It's all done tongue-in-cheek if a bit crudely.

 The productions values of this movie is top notch! The costumes were all exquisitely tailored and hand made for the principals, and they are gorgeous! A costume designer's fantasy come true.  And there are funny details in that Catcher and Barbara both have extravegant fantasy apartments, and Barbara's has a balcony view the showcases every major NYC tourist attraction!  Catcher's apartment is the ultimate bachelor pad with lots of secret compartments and a roll-away bed.  Ewan McGregor is perfect as Catch, he looke like a cross between James Bond and a Ken Doll. (Although when not intentionally impersonating a Texan to fool Barbara, he can't decide if he has an American Accent or a Scottish one -- oops!)  Renee Zellwegger is okay as Barbra, I think Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoon would have been a little less forced.  But in the end that doesn't matter, this is a very fun movie that I enjoyed.  David Hyde Pierce plays basically the same part that Tony Randall played in all the old Doris Day pictures, the rejected, but lovable second banana. Hyde Pierce is perfect, as is  Sarah Paulsen as Barbara's friend Vikki Hiller, and she and Pierce have their own sweet romance. Also, how appropriate that the late Tony Randall is here in a cameo, as the head of the book company.  (This was his last film role).

  All in all, it's a fun romp of nostalgia with a modern twist. This is the perfect movie for a rainy afternoon.  Be sure you get the widescreen version!!  The plot isn't perfect, but if you love movies where the style and costumes outrank subatance, this is the one for you!",1091059200,,3091,4.66728280961183
1469146,4,B00005JLZW,"Down With Love is a homage to the Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedies of the late 50's and early 60's.  The film revolves around a young, unknown writer Barbara Novak (Renee Zelleweger) who has penned a runaway bestseller, Down With Love, which says that women can act just like men especially when it comes to sex.  Women all over the country are becoming liberated and men aren't happy.  Magazine writer and swinging ladies man Catcher Block (Ewan MacGregor) wants to interview Barbara and when he is denied, he sets up a scheme to take her down.  Posing as a shy, mild-mannered astronaut Zip Martin, he sets off to make Barbara fall in love with him and disprove the whole Down With Love premises.  Along for help are Catcher's best friend, Peter MacManus (David Hyde Pierce) and Barbara's best friend and editor (Vikki Hiller).  Tony Randall, who appeared in three of the Hudson-Day films, makes his final film appearance as the head of Barbara's publishing company.  The film is an entertaining romp and the actors have their tongues firmly in their cheeks.  Mr. MacGregor & Ms. Zelleweger have great chemistry and the fun they having in the film clearly shows off.  The sets are magnificent and the retro look and styles adds to film's appeal.  The closing credits contains a great song and dance number with Mr. MacGregor and Ms. Zelleweger clearing taking advantage of the talents they showed in Moulin Rouge & Chicago respectively.",1089158400,,1439,4.836734693877551

1469232,4,B00005JLZW,"I agree with other reviewers that to really get the whole ""Down With Love"" experience, it helps to have actually seen a Rock Hudson/Doris Day film. This is such a loving homage to the uptight virgin/reformed playboy films of the early 1960s, it's hard not to like it.
Renee Zellweger squints and pouts her way through the film as Barbara Novak, a Helen Gurley Brown-style writer who urges women to replace sex with chocolate and by the time they've attained level 3, sex with men is take it or leave it and without the strings-attached love. Swinging writer Catcher Block, ladies' man, man's man, man about town, is on the defensive after he puts off meeting with Barbara for an interview one too many times and she disses him on the Ed Sullivan Show, causing his formerly complacent conquests to shimmy away.
Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as the cad swinger, and plays him with a tongue in the cheek and a wink in the eye and no trace of hiding that adorable Scottish accent. David Hyde-Pierce is spot-on in the fussy Tony Randall role as Block's editor. Cute-as-a-button Sarah Paulson plays Barbara's editor Vicky Hiller, who professes to be the ultimate career girl but who really wants to be married.
The sets and costumes are perfect; over the top as only the 60s were. The plot twists are typical of the usual sex comedy of the period, even the nearly five-minute soliloquy by Zellweger done in breathy Doris Day style near the end that sums up the whole movie and seems to have been done with no cuts (bravo, Renee!) Tony Randall himself has a cameo as TB, the head of the publishing house for ""Down With Love."" (It's interesting to note that Randall always had the vaguely homosexual role whereas Hudson played manly in every movie, when in real life Randall was straight and Hudson gay. Truth is, as they say, stranger than fiction!)
The split-screen effect so often employed with Rock and Doris on the phone in the bathtub is used a little more naughtily here but in a cute way. Renee and Ewan even do a little song and dance number at the end credits of the type so beloved in 60s sex comedies. No surprise that they both sang and danced winningly in Moulin Rouge (him) and Chicago (her).
I deleted one star only for underuse of Tony Randall; he could have been much more effective than he was. Otherwise, this frothy confection isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon. It doesn't take itself too seriously, so you shouldn't either; just lay back and enjoy it, as Vicky's mother would say.",1086825600,3,2500,4.5950782997762865
1469233,5,B00005JLZW,"""Down With Love"" was a cool, breezy little film.  I have to admit that I finally have a reason to love Renee Zellweger - this movie was tailor made for her.  This is a real date movie for both sexes. Although the plot twist at the end was a little unbelievable, so what??  This is a comedy, not a documentary.
Thoroughly enjoyable and romantic.  You'll love it.",1086566400,2,361,4.343283582089552
1469234,3,B00005JLZW,"When Down with Love came out, I had no desire to see another movie where Rene Zwelleger squinting and making cutesy-pie faces at the camera. But when I saw the movie on cable, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. Down with Love is 95-minutes of silliness perfect for a Saturday night rental.
In the movie, Ewan McGregor plays Catcher Block, ladies man extraordinaire and hot shot expos writer for the men's magazine, No. Rene plays a Barbara Novak, an author who pens the feminist manifesto, Down with Love. Barbara declares that love and marriage are for the birds, and that the modern woman wants to work outside the home and have emotionless sex like a man. Barbara also swears that she is the epitome of the woman she writes about. Catcher Block takes it upon himself to expose Barbara, and prove that she wants what all women really want: love, marriage, a house in the suburbs, and a bunch of kids.
To carry out his rouse, Catcher dons the disguise of a square, all-American astronaut, Zip Martin. His plan is to have Zip woo Barbara into declaring her love and trashing her manifesto. However, Barbara has her own rouse up her sleeve and aims to give Catcher his comeuppance. Down with Love then delivers an unseen surprise that brings down Catcher's whole philosophy on romance.
This flick is a parody of the 1950s romantic-sex comedies made famous by Rock Hudson and Doris Day, and it plays the parody to the hilt complete with ridiculous double entendres and amusingly-corny sight gags. Ewan McGregor has great presence no matter what role he plays, and keeps your eyes drawn to the screen each time he appears. And his tongue-in-cheek playboy swagger will have you in stitches every time he makes a step. Some of the best laughs come from Catcher's unlucky-in-love editor and best friend, played by David Hyde Pierce with the ultimate Niles Crane and Felix Unger prissiness. (The prissiness is played so much so that his would-be love interest accuses him of being gay.)
The only downside of Down with Love is that unless you've seen or read about the 1950s sex comedies, you have no point of reference for the jokes. Otherwise, it's a short piece of fluffy fun.",1085875200,,2191,4.738219895287958
1469235,4,B00005JLZW,"There were those who questioned whether the world really *needed* to see a return to the ""Pillow Talk"" days of sex comedies.  After all, it's not exactly like Rock Hudson/Doris Day flicks are the most popular rentals at the corner store.
""Down With Love"" answers those questions with a resounding raspberry.  The romantic comedies of the early 60's were alive with youthful naivete, charm, and the wit it took to bring sex onto the screen during a rather repressed era.  ""DWL"" looks back at those comedies with adoring affection.
Our hero:  Catcher Block (Ewan MacGregor), the kind of journalist who can ""get the story"" while spending the night with triplets and then helicoptering to work, walks the streets of New York as if the city's playing his own jazz soundtrack -- just right for a comeuppance.  Our heroinne: Barbara Novak (Rene Zellweger), budding author and feminist, is the perfect foil for him (or so she appears), as the proud advocate of women's sexual liberation.
Twists and turns abound -- Catcher refuses to interview Ms. Novak because she's a nobody, until she becomes the hottest author in New York and is too big to talk to Catcher (although she talks *about* him to a giddy press corps in unflattering terms).  Catcher, his sex life cut off by Ms. Novak, decides to seduce her by pretending to be an astronaut, and then . . . well, silliness abounds.
This ""plot"" is an excuse for brilliant writers to write brilliant lines for attractive actors to say brilliantly.  The cast, including a hilarious David Hyde Pierce and even a cameo by a perfectly cast Tony Randall, is up to the challenge -- breathing life into a clever, zippy script.
Set designers and costume designers must have fought over the chance to make this movie, as the sets and costumes are pop-60's on steroids.  Catcher's ""apartment"" (what is the rent on that thing?) is a sight to behold, and so rakish that even the nerdy Pierce can make with the lovin' in that pad.
At the end of the day, when all is right with the world and balance is restored to the universe, you might wonder what the point of the exercise was.  The answer is simple, and was right in front of you the entire time -- the exercise is the point, and the exercise is style.",1083542400,2,2232,4.644670050761421

1469298,4,B00005JLZW,"Definitely the most best-selling love and sex comedy all over the cities in the world for the year two thousand and three, just like Barbara Novak's book DOWN WITH LOVE did 4 decades ago (except that was fictional and this is not only for women but also men) in the year nineteen sixty-two.
Barbara Novak is a newly landed blonde author-bombshell, determined to use her book to take the then devious man's world by storm and make women equal as their countersex, however with a very personal hidden agenda: To become a hugely successful woman under her real identity - a brunnette spinster Nancy Brown formerly worked as a secretary (and secretly fell in love) for the hotshot ""KNOWN"" man Catcher Block -  and set herself apart from any other obedient (or easy) women and make her former journalist boss desire her with yet a disguised decent identity. And we're talking about in a time when, without too much technologies for a communication media, a simple piece of paper work can bring the world's metropolis down to any moral innovation or re-awakening of the sex battle.
Rene Zellweger is cute, sweet with a hilariously flirtatious manner that makes you want to burp sometimes. Ewan McGregor is perfectly charming as an English gentleman as he genuinely is in real. Both also create quite a clip for the ending credit with their singing talent.
If you enjoy the super-saturated 60s technicolour, backlot-fake New York city street scenes, snazzy apartments among other colourful things on screen with a little campy jokes, you'd be downright happy to take a seat to DOWN WITH LOVE.",1079308800,2,1585,4.87037037037037
1469299,2,B00005JLZW,"""Down With Love"" is a tribute to the Rock Hudson and Doris Day comedies of the early '60s. The movie begins with a series of colorful cartoons and has a wonderfully retro feel throughout. Set in 1962, the fanciful costumes, stage sets and music work seamlessly to provide delightful eye and ear candy for an hour and a half.
Unfortunately, the acting ruins the movie. Cast in the lead role of Barbara Novak, Rene Zellweger is a Twiggy-esque version of Bridget Jones with a hidden vengeance. Her romantic interest, Catcher Block, is played by Ewan McGregor. The epitome of the decade's playboy stereotype, Block is self-propelled into a cat-and-mouse game with the ultra-feminist Novak.
Simultaneously, Block's boss Peter MacMannus (David Hyde Pierce) is engaged in pursuit of Novak's editor, Vikki Hiller (Sarah Paulson). Pierce is highly typecast as the neurotic and insecure MacMannus.
The plot centers around Novak's book, ""Down With Love."" Our heroine is a feminist touting the joys of sex without love, encouraging women to ""enjoy it like a man does"" because ""love is a distraction"" in the workplace. Forsake love for equality amongst men. Of course, the evil Block sets out to expose her true self to the world. Silliness ensues, with an inundation of sexual innuendo.
Zellweger overacts, while Pierce seems flat. His character, Mac-Mannus, has no depth, adding little to the movie. McGregor is also a disappointment, except, perhaps, to the girl sitting across the aisle from me who audibly sighed at the sight of his naked and hairy torso.
Block's character would have been better suited for a romantic-comedy veteran such as Hugh Grant. Young and wet behind the ears, McGregor doesn't satisfy as the conniving lead. With the exception of Paulson, the lead roles were ill-cast with actors who didn't seem to know the line between acting and exaggerating.
There is a plot twist before the predictable happy Hollywood ending. Overly verbose in its explanation, the twist is not developed past the scene in which it occurs, leaving audiences unfulfilled.
The ending is also too neat. The movie spends over an hour setting the scene, gives Novak several minutes for a monologue during the twist sequence and finally devotes a mere 15 minutes to a complete, simple and unsurprising resolution. Utterly unacceptable. As with that other three-word, visually stunning movie that ended with ""Love"" (and began with ""Punch-Drunk""), ""Down With Love"" is not a winner.
The Sunday afternoon showing I attended had an audience of at most 20 people, mostly elderly couples seeking a bit of nostalgia. College students, though, are unlikely to remember Rock Hudson or Doris Day -- especially not through a tribute like this one.",1079136000,7,2718,5.110112359550562

Like Katherine Hepburn's comedies with Spencer Tracy, these films, dressed in the guise of humor, introduced us to women who wanted it all.

Outweighing any negativity DOWN WITH LOVE certainly has style. I liked this film and all the nostalgia that it embellishes the screen with. The production design was perfect in every detail making it a great visual treat. That is the film's strength. The only real weakness and one quality that almost defeats the film single handedly is the score by Marc Shiman which is more patronizing than being the homage that the score should have been.

It's so 60s, so charming, so everything that I'm not used to seeing as a girl born in the 80s. This movie will take you back to the time of the sex comedy, reminiscent of the Doris Day and Rock Hudson films. It's fun, flirty, and just an all around great time.
Zellweger is Barbara Novak, a woman who has just completed her first book titled ""Down With Love."" Her editor, played by the talented Sara Paulson, knows that for people to buy the book they have to do a ton of publicity for it, so she arranges for Barbara to be interviewed by men's magazine writer Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor). However, Catcher avoids her, thinking that she is a ""spinster"" because she wrote a book titled ""Down With Love."" The rest of the film is a fun cat and mouse game between the two, with interesting, surprising, and downright funny results.
With great performances from the leads, as well as David Hyde Pierce and Sara Paulson, this movie is such a treasure. It has fashion and flair and will no doubt charm the pants off anyone who sees it. McGregor gives a great performance as a ladies man, and as someone who wasn't sure what to think about McGregor, I now have a huge crush on him after seeing this movie. Zellweger is also fantastic, with her little mannerisms that match the music throughout the movie and just her amazing ability to captivate an audience no matter what she's doing.
The special features are fun on the DVD as well, with deleted scenes, bloopers, and featurettes. Very nice indeed. We also get a snappy little music number at the end of the film, which is included in the special features. So, see this movie. It's such a great time!!",1078099200,2,1757,4.4766355140186915
1469303,4,B00005JLZW,"This is what used to be a called a comedy of manners - a sex comedy.  The sex play isn't really worse than the James Bond films or similar films from the sixties with their double entendre and rather obvious word and camera play.  Yes, this film is a bit more blatant with it, but it is playful and funny if you like this sort of thing.  If you are uncomfortable with this kind of sexual comedy then stay away because you won't like this.  But if you go back and really watch the comedies this was modeled on they were just as sexual.  However, I cannot understand why people keep comparing this to Doris Day and Rock Hudson.  It isn't.  It is more like Jack Lemon in ""Under the Yum Yum Tree"" or with Shirley McCaline in ""The Apartment"" than anything Day and Hudson did.
I thought Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor were quite good and enjoyable.  David Hyde Pierce and Sarah Paulson were also terrific as the second couple falling in love (another standard trope of this genre).  And seeing Tony Randall on the screen again is always wonderful.  Of course, having him here is part of the tribute paid to those sixties films that Randall was in.
Don't expect an innocent memory of a film.  They were going after the spirit of the age of free love, women's lib, and when people still smoked at work.  They did a good job with it.  It isn't for everyone's tastes, but I thought it was fun.",1077840000,,1386,4.346303501945525

Renee Z. was alittle too ""oh my God-ish"" but she grew on you as the film went along. Frankly, I don't see how any woman could change a man that quickly. Especially being the playboy type.

I think there is a 95% chance that you will enjoy it thoroughly, as I and the half-crowded (alas!) movie theatre did when we saw it in its original release.

1469388,4,B00005JLZW,"As I missed out on the Day/Hudson films of the 60's, this spoof/satire was a new & entertaining type of film for me.  I felt like it had some basis in times gone by, but I've learned alot from the other reviews posted here.
First, for those who don't know, the film focuses on two spirited characters: Barbarah Novak (Zellweger) & Catcher Block (McGregor).  Novak is supposedly a feminist who writes a book called ""Down With Love"" which teaches women how to free themselves from the need for love in order to become successful in the workplace.  In her publicity efforts, she gets connected with Catcher Block: the ""woman's man, man's man, man about town"" top journalist in NYC.  As the ultimate womanizer, he is the enemy of her cause, and as her book gains momentum she takes him on in public.
Sound serious?  Sound like it is tackling the monstrous issue of feminism & true love?  Well, don't worry, it never lets you take it that seriously.  From the absurdly gaudy outfits (gaudy from a 21st perspective) to the frivolous conversations, you know that this movie isn't about a deep introspection about mankind.  Rather, the tension between these strong-willed characters sets up a convenient focus for this romp of a storyline.
If you can get past all the sexual innuendos, then the movie is entertaining (if predictable) on a very superficial level during the first hour.  I enjoyed seeing McGregor in another role (having just seen him in ""Big Fish""), and I wondered if he might be one of the few great actors of the younger generation.  (The only one I have in that category so far is Johnny Depp).  Zellweger also filled her role admirably, even if she still might rely on her looks more than true acting ability.  David Hyde-Pierce is as neurotic as ever and takes on a very loveable Niles type of role (Niles from ""Frasier"").  Zellweger's editor is a pretty stereotypical best-friend character in the line of Carry Fisher's role in ""When Harry Met Sally.""
In my opinion, the last 30 minutes is when the movie gets particularly interesting because it goes beyond the expected happy ending.  There are more turns than you ever see coming as the ""I knew you knew I knew..."" thing builds with each character trying to out-maneuver the other.  However, it's all still a farce, and you aren't particularly concerned with how it turns out because you aren't emotionally tied to all the characters.
So, yeah, if you want a fluffy romp & don't mind (or even enjoy) somewhat crude innuendos, then you may have found your movie.",1074988800,,2527,4.724373576309795
1469389,1,B00005JLZW,"I understand that this is supposed to be a satire, but even a successful satire should be entertaining. The only thing this movie succeeds in being is a World Class BORE!
Renee Zellweger was cute enough in a part devoid of any character, but Ewan McGregor falls way short of the standards set by leading men like James Garner, Rock Hudson, and Rod Taylor. Instead of watching this movie, spend a night mastering your Epi-lady instead. I promise you you'll have more fun.",1074988800,7,470,4.674698795180723
1469390,4,B00005JLZW,"I rented this movie because I love both the lead actor and actress and it looked cute.  I'm so glad I did!  This was a hilarious movie that is kind of a spoof of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies back in the 60's.
The basic idea is that Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) authored a book called ""Down With Love"" which inspired women to stop falling in love and start acting like men, that is - have sex ""a la carte"" and not let love interfere with their careers.
Hotshot womanizing journalist Catcher Block (Ewan Mcgregor)wants to find a way to expose Barbara Novak and ruin her, because her book is losing him all his dates!  He creates an alternate persona of Zip Martin, a geeky astronaut, and gets Barbara to fall in love with him.  There is a very tongue-in-cheek twist ending, but it was still funny!
There are some great one-liners here, and the very suggestive talking on the telephone scene is hilarious!  The acting is superb, I absolutely loved both Mcgregor and Zellweger in the roles, they were perfect!  The costumes were also great, I loved the scenes where Barbara and her editor, Vicky, enter a restaurant and shed their jackets.  Too funny!
Anyways, overall - this was a very cute movie.  I highly recommend checking it out, its not like most romantic comedies that come out of Hollywood these days.  Some might not like it, or realize how tongue-in-cheek the whole movie is, but I found myself really enjoying it because it was unique.",1074902400,,1450,4.610894941634241

You have been warned.

The director's comentary is an excrutiating exercise in self-aggrandizement. The guy does not have a clue about what makes a movie work and what is commercial.  This is an arty, private indulgence that is as unfortunately ill-conceived as the shot for shot remake of ""Psycho.""",1074556800,8,501,5.384615384615385
1469392,4,B00005JLZW,"After my girlfriend and I rented the Hulk and Down With Love on a Friday night, you can guess what movie I was looking forward to watching.  However, to my complete surprise, the Hulk left me...disappointed.  It wasn't what I expected.  So my girlfriend threw in Down With Love into the DVD player, and it turned out to be the highlight of the evening.
 First things first.  I've never seen the 60's classics that Down With Love is supposed to imitate.  I am completely uneducated and uninformed about any references to older movies or actors or plots or themes.  Maybe my girlfriend had greater insight while watching Down With Love, but for me, as a guy, it was just a really good movie.
 For one, it was hilarious!  Some of the jokes and one liners are obviously adult-oriented.  The cut-scene where Ewan and Renee are talking on the phone had my girlfriend and I roaring in laughter!
 Ewan McGregor, obviously known to me as Obi-Wan, is an amazing actor.  I was afraid his Star Wars stunt was as far as his talent would allow, but seeing him in Moulin Rouge (which was also surprisingly good) and now in Down With Love, has me convinced of his acting and singing abilities.  He definitely needs to be given more movies and more roles to see what he can do.  After watching Down With Love, I now look forward to seeing him in Big Fish.
 Renee Zellwegger plays a great girl-next-door, probably a leftover typecast from Jerry Maguire.  She's gorgeous, and far better here than in Chicago (I'll never forgive my girlfriend for making me watch it).  From her recent Oscar nominations, I guess she's also an amazing actress, but to be honest, Ewan McGregor's playboy role stole the show.
 For anybody dreading another Chicago, don't worry, there isn't any singing in Down With Love, except for one song in the end credits.
 After the disappointment of the Hulk, I was glad my girlfriend picked out Down With Love.  It was really funny, and I especially enjoyed the whole womanizer/man-hater battle.  For guys watching this movie, don't nuke it out and try to find a deeper meaning than what you see (as I'm sure most female viewers will).  Enjoy it as a movie that will make you laugh.  It may be styled in the 1960's, but the humor is definitely 21st century.",1074556800,,2258,4.6040100250626566
1469393,3,B00005JLZW,"Down with Love re-creates the look and feel of the saccharine 60s comedies starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson, and it has some decidely good parts. Namely, the costumes and sets are incredible, capturing the candy-coated world typified in these movies.  Down with Love also has some clever touches.  For example, Tony Randall has a bit part as the owner of a men's magazine - a knowing nod to his many co-starring roles in the original Day/Hudson productions.
However, these features are all for naught as the script is flat and uninspired, packed with lame double-entendres.  More importantly, whether the filmmakers intended the movie as an homage, a parody, or a satire is unclear.  As a result, the movie limps along without any bite to its inevitable climax.  Director Peyton Reed has done some interesting comedies, including the engaging cheerleader comedy, ""Bring It On,"" but Down with Love is not one of his best.
The DVD is packed with extras, including many brief behind-the-scenes featurettes, but it's hard to get excited about these features for such a mixed bag movie.",1074297600,17,1083,4.9944444444444445

Yet to enjoy the fact that this movie is a remake of 1960's Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies, you would have to be 50 years old at least.  And I don't think that is the age group this movie is targeting, or should be targeting.
So while I enjoyed the unique style of this movie, I had never seen ""Pillow Talk"" or other type movies, so I had no idea what this movie was spoofing.
Still, it was funny and charming and somewhat stands on its own.  However, the characters of Barbara Novak and Catcher Block seem so intent on portraying stereotypes from the past that they never really seem to connect with the audience as real characters.
I liked this movie and laughed out loud several times.  It just took about 30 minutes for me to get used to the fact that this was going to be a different style of movie (not in a bad way, just in a out of touch way.)",1073865600,6,1012,4.22279792746114

Renee Zellweger was on an excellent role with her parts in White Oleander, Chicago, and Bridget Jones Diary until she mustve been drunk while signing a contract to star in this love story fairytale. Renee plays a writer who tells woman not to get married and to focus more on thier careers and Ewan disguises himself as an astronaut who would like love more than sex in order to prove she can fall 'down with love'. In a 50's setting this looks like it was made in no time, with no strenous parts to move. Although it was entertaining the acting by both Ewan and Renee was sloppy and not well done when David Hyde Pierce, as always, did an excellent job to give this dull movie a comic boost as the frustrated assistant. If you just love poorly made chick-flicks (always the bad choice) go on, see this but if you like real movies with real plots, keep away from this. 'Down with Love' stumbles its way through ever-so shocking turn arounds in the ever-so poorly made plot.",1072569600,4,1079,4.482233502538071
1469460,4,B00005JLZW,"ever since i saw the trailer for this movie i knew i would love it. i was right. i like to watch romantic comedies like any average joe (or jane) but so many movies in the ""romantic"" genre are too corny. what i like about this movie is the air of playfulness that it has, and although everything is made to imitate the old movies of the early '60s to me it doesn't seemed contrived at all. heck, i think some of meg ryan's romantic movies are more contrived than this one.
the casting of ewan mcgregor and renee zellweger was spot on - they has such an incredible chemistry it's amazing! mcgregor is absolutely charming as the blatant playboy catcher block - man, that name is so... obvious - and zellweger complements him to a tee as the cute, sexy independent woman writer. and i think david hyde pierce was awesome as usual... this man never had a role that i don't like - NEVER.
the story line seems usual enough to the '60s bedroom comedy, replete with the womanizer getting his come-uppance, but the ending will blow you away. really, you have to watch it to appreciate it.
and what can i say about the costumes and set? it's just exquisite. the costumes... man, if i have a few of them in my closet, i'd be playing  dress up for hours. they are just beautiful, beautiful creations and had the movie stank to hades i would still see it just for the clothes. thankfully the movie is excellent so we don't need to wade through a muddy swamp to enjoy the visual ecstacy the costumes provides.
this dvd is really packed with a lot of goodies, well made and presented. the scene selections are numerous making it easy to get to any scene, and the specials really shows how every piece is assembled to produce the end product. a good balance between content and brevity.
all in all, i highly recommend this movie; it has a witty, tongue-in-cheek feeling heavily dosed with good humor and romance finished off with a slick production.

1469461,3,B00005JLZW,"Why did I watch this film? Well, I really like old Rock Hudson-Doris Day films. I do watch them in a different light now than I did 40+ years ago - thank God! But that was then. And ""Down With Love"" is now...and it's a clever parody of every film Doris and Rock ever made, including the best/worst of: split screen telephone conversations in suggestive positions; hackneyed sexual innuendoes; casual chauvinistic male behavior; corny seduction lines; and diverse bachelor pads filled with gadgets geared to seduce women. It is mind-boggling how much time and energy used to be expended for the purpose of seduction. And for those who are clothes conscious, there are more wardrobe changes for Renee Zellweger than Doris Day had in all her films put together - and the costume design is fabulous! Ms. Zellweger's clothes are sometimes funnier than her lines! (Funny in a nostalgic, retro way).
All right - I watched this film because I loved Ms. Zellweger in ""Chicago"" and Ewan McGregor was fabulous in ""Moulin Rouge."" They're good here also...but nowhere near as good. It's the material not the actors! And there was a blizzard in the Northeast, I was snowed-in and there was nothing else to watch. That's the truth. So I will recommend ""Down With Love"" with some qualifications.
Be advised that the film is super light entertainment, er, fluff. It is not biting satire nor is it truly witty, although I had some really good silly laughs. The movie cleverly parodies a film genre with a bit of French farce thrown in. It does get old. There's a nice twist at the end to snap things up, but I did keep asking myself, until the very end, why don't I just rent ""Pillow Talk?"" After the very last scene was completed, ""The End"" appeared on the screen, the credits came up...and I realized that the best part had yet to come. Good thing I left my DVD player on! While the credits run, Ms. Zellweger and Mr. McGregor do a song and dance routine that is spectacular! The talent that I loved from Chicago and Moulin Rouge combine and it is worth every minute of watching what came before. So, if you are rained or snowed-in and feel like a few laughs and some light entertainment, go for it! The last scene is really terrific and the rest isn't too bad!

Every detail from the men's stylishly pink shirts and masculine decor to the girl's precariously thin stiletto heels and lushly false lashes is divinely recreated, and the set designers should be worshipped as Gods.

1469539,4,B00005JLZW,"""Down with Love"" is a little gem of a movie that pays homage to the vintage 60s Doris Day-Rock Hudson films that were considered so witty in their day.
Although director Peyton Reed explains in his excellent commentary (more about that later) that the film was based on a montage of many of the 60s movies, the plot most resembles ""Pillow Talk""--and Renee and Ewan are absolutely perfect.
From the clothes to the sets to the photography to the color to the split-screen ""talking on the phone"" scenes (much more suggestive than the originals!), this perfectly choreographed, beautifully written romp is just a blast, as we would have said back then. There is just enough of a ""wink-wink"" to let you know that the actors know that YOU know that it's all tongue in cheek""--but even though the satire is broad, it never spoils the fun.
David Hyde-Pierce is superb as the neurotic friend of Ewan (the old Tony Randall role), and Tony Randall himself makes a cameo appearance that is simply the icing on the cake. The acting is a work of art, just right, making everything seem effortless.
But when one watches the director's commentary, one realizes just how tightly each scene was choreographed to achieve that ""effortless"" look--unlike most DVDs, I found the director's comments actually added to my enjoyment of the movie, and I watched it again after finishing his explanation of how things were done.

This movie is nothing like those sweet sentimental and tasteful movies of the fifties. The ads claim that they play some type of tribute or homage to the Rock and Day films. On the disappointing contrary, this film makes fun of the Rock and Hudson movies, and makes a disrespectful parody of the great classics.
First of all, Rene Z. walks around in a prissy manner, as if that is in any way how Doris Day used to walk. Second of all, Rock Hudson was closer to James Bond. While Ewen MacGregor is closer to Austen Powers. MacGregor is just too goofy and un-studly for this role. And the chemistry with Rene is zilch.
I found this film offensive because its advertisements lead me to believe I would be seeing a recreation of those old lovely movies.
In the Director's monologue, he says that the sexual innuendo is present as it is in those old movies. However, the old movies had tasetful innuendos. They weren't overt and raunchy.

I think this film is grossly misunderstood and underappreciated.  Peyton Reed has done a wonderful job in recreating the fun, silly, romantic sex-comedies of the 1960s.  Everything from the sets, the costumes, the music score, the dialogue, the wide angle shots, and the stock footage -- which borrows from ""That Touch of Mink"", by the way -- are perfectly applied to this modern homage.  Ewan and Renee give delightful performances that don't attempt to imitate the chemistry created by Rock and Doris, not that they could.  That's a pretty tall order to fill.  Instead, they create their own chemistry, and they do so wonderfully.
David Hyde Pierce and Sarah Paulson pull some hilarious, showstopping scenes out of their hats as well.  My favorite is the ""fight"" in front of the elevator.  The People's Eyebrow couldn't compete with the look that David delivers.  No one's kidding when they call this man a comic genius.
There's some delightful treats in the shape of Tony Randall, too-naughty-for-1962 split-screen phone conversations, and a variety show song & dance number with a funny cameo by Marc Shaiman.  The DVD has a fantastic blooper reel, plus behind the re-creation of 1962 shorts.  Not to be oversimplified, the attention to detail does not end with the glossy gowns.  In this film, we get a social snapshot of our film psyche with references to the space race, dacron vs. garters, cultural stereotypes of foreign countries, the Hollywood version of beatnicks, and feminism before the Women's Movement.
I've heard some critics complain that the film would have worked better as a musical or it's full of simplistic double entendres and plotlines.  Hello!  Welcome to the '60s!  Take a look back at some of those classic films and you'll see the exact same characteristics and ""faults"".  Plus, a lot these complaints can be attributed to many of the vapid, nonsensical romantic comedies made today as well.
What's great about ""Down With Love"" is that it's not only an homage to those classic films of yesteryear, but it delivers a final presentation that could easily have been lost in a time capsule for 40 years and resurfaced today.  The only thing that pulls it closer to 2003 than 1962 is the frank conversations about casual sex, which just lends credence to the idea as to why it could've been shelved 40 years ago.  It's not that you wouldn't have heard those conversations back then, they just wouldn't have made it to the silver screen.
I hope more people give this film a chance.  People who will choose to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is -- a delightful, comedic film with a kiss of history that makes us laugh at ourselves.  If you do rent the DVD, you can see in the HBO special that the cast and crew had just as much fun making the film as you will watching it.",1066348800,4,3026,4.673584905660378
1469548,3,B00005JLZW,"This is a cute movie.  Renee Zellweger moves with perfect comedic timing.  Having been around in the 60's I see her as a combination of Marilyn Monroe(Some Like it Hot), Barbara Eden(I dream of Jeannie), and almost Doris Day.  Almost, because no one, but no one can do Doris Day as Doris Day did Doris Day.  But the style is very much like the romantic comedies of the sixties and the movie is set in the sixties as well.  The problem is, of course, that Rock Hudson and James Garner are missing.  But we do get Tony Randall back looking much less like Tony Randall.  However, the guy from Frazier plays Tony almost as well as Tony played Tony in the sixties.  All of that is not enough because  Ewan Macgregor lacks  the chemistry necessary to create the sparks we saw fly in the oldies but goodies.  Despite the miscasting of the leading man the movie is worth watching.  If you weren't around in the 60's now you can see what your parents or grandparents thought worth leaving the T.V. set and getting out to a movie.  Better yet, rent Pillow Talk, Send Me No Flowers, or Move Over Darling....",1066176000,,1096,4.42
1469646,3,B00005JLZW,"Let's begin with the strengths of this picture.  The creators took great pains to recreate the look and feel of the films of the late '50s and early '60s.  They were absolutely successful and should be commended.  The biggest challenge faced in producing this type of period piece is recreating not only the look and feel of the period, which many of us still remember,  but also recreating the look and feel of the movies of the time.  If you only buy the movie for this reason, you will not be disappointed.
As for the rest of the movie, it's acceptable but not outstanding.  David Hyde Pierce is phenomenal in his supporting role (generally played by Tony Randall in the old Rock Hudson and Doris Day pictures).  The split screen (think Pillow Talk) sequences lose something in this updated version and probably would have been better without the too obvious sexual references.
Given all this, ""Down With Love"" is still worth watching as long as you are a fan of the older movies.  Give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised.",1066089600,,1038,4.633879781420765
1469647,4,B00005JLZW,"Small town farm girl Barbara Novak (Rene Zellweger) writes a best-selling book called ""Down with Love"" instructing women how to find the same satisfaction in sex and work as men. Catcher Block (Ewan MacGregor) -- ladies' man, man's man , man about town -- sets out to expose her by making her fall in love with him.  But things go awry as he begins to have feelings for her in this tribute to the 1960's sex comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson.
It's full of wonderful performances by Zellweger and MacGregor, but the supporting cast steals the show.  David Hyde Pierce is Peter Macmannus, Catcher's boss at ""Know"" the magazine for men in the now; Sarah Paulson plays Vikki Hiller, the editor-in-chief at Banner Publications.  The banter and sexual tension/frustration the two of them share on-screen is hysterical.
The film is also filled with fabulous fashions and hairstyles  reminiscent of those romantic comedies.  The film's creators kept the spirit of those films alive in costume, set design, music, film technique and a script full of sexual innuendo.  The phone conversation between Cathcer and Barbara --using split screen -- is one of the funniest scenes I've seen to date.  (And, you must watch the credits for a song by Barbara Novak and Cather Block!)
The DVD picture and sound quality are great.  Plus, the many extras -- including deleted scenes, a blooper reel, hair and wardrobe tests, documentaries, and a music video -- make this a great DVD to watch.",1066003200,,1473,4.864
1469648,5,B00005JLZW,"Let's clear up one thing about this film--Ewan and Renee aren't SUPPOSED to be Rock and Doris--people are waaaay too hung up on that. Ewan (if you've seen him in Moulin Rouge you know darn well he could have played Catcher more like Christian) was told to work out and get skinnier. He's playing more of a hip slickster/Rat Pack-y character in this; he, the director and producers have said he's NOT supposed to be Rock. And Renee is not playing Doris, they needed an actress who could be devious yet retain the sympathy of the audience. Instead of knocking this film because Ewan and Renee aren't Rock and Doris, you'd think people would be glad for a change the leads aren't playing themselves. They actually have talent and are creating a character---imagine that---real acting in a romantic comedy.",1065916800,3,802,4.776978417266187
1469649,3,B00005JLZW,"I gave this three stars because they did such a great job evoking the perky sex comedies of the sixties with the sets, costumes, music and editing - this a great piece of retro eye candy!  The real problem - which the film cannot overcome -- is the casting.  David Hyde Pierce shines in the Tony Randall-type role and Jerri Ryan does a great swinging 60's stewardess, but the rest of the cast is just wrong.
Zellweger is either all cartoonish or all breathy monotone and never really conveys that really CUTE ""I believe in this character no matter how silly"" innocense that made Doris Day, Sandra Dee and Natalie Wood so charming in these roles.
McGregor is a fine actor who can be as rico-suave as the best of them, but he's just too lanky and angular.  You just don't quite believe him in this role.  Sarah Paulson as Zellweger's sidekick has the look - but she seems too soft somehow.  The whole time I was watching I kept thinking how much funnier and sweeter it would have felt with actors like Jennifer Anniston, John Cusack and Parker Posey.
What's good here is really wonderful, but it becomes a frustrating letdown.  Instead of being a tribute to those great sunday-afternoon-sixties-flicks, it feels like a really expensive skit on Saturday Night Live or some such program.",1065830400,,1283,4.654867256637168
1469650,4,B00005JLZW,"It's 1962, and the streets of New York are bustling with business and alive with color. Barbara Novak (Rene Zellweger) has arrived in the big city to visit the publisher of her new book ""Down With Love"", a self-help guide for women whose personal and professional progress are being hindered by their need for male companionship. Barbara's editor Vikki (Sarah Paulson) has arranged an interview with ""Know"" magazine's star journalist Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor), which is sure to grab the attention of the reading public and make the book fly off the shelves. Catcher is a suave playboy bachelor, a ""ladies' man, man's man, man about town"", who prides himself on being exactly the kind of man that ""Down With Love"" cautions against, and so he is reluctant to meet with Barbara. But when he sees a photograph of her, Catcher realizes his mistake in assuming that she was a dowdy spinster. He concocts a plan to seduce Barbara into betraying her ""down with love"" philosophy so that he might write an expos revealing her as a fraud, and he uses himself as bait. A battle of wits and sexes ensues as Barbara and Catcher duel to see who will betray her/his convictions first in the name of love.

""Down With Love"" is startling evidence of how time marches on. Now ""period"" films depict the latter half of the twentieth century, which much of their audience still remembers vividly. Director Peyton Reed and writers Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake have modeled ""Down With Love"" on the romantic comedies of the late 1950s and early 1960s that were typified by the popular ""Pillow Talk"" starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. But Peyton Reed has gone one better than his 20th century inspirations: ""Down With Love"" is racier in its innuendo than its predecessors. And where the comedies of Hudson and Day strived to look realistic to the day, ""Down With Love"" embraces the hyper-realism of a heavily stylized and whimsical New York City as seen through the eyes of Hollywood idealism. The attention to detail in this film is incredible. The costumes and sets are perfectly suited to the time and carefully chosen from among the most expressive post-war designs. Some of the still backgrounds are lavishly painted sets. And director Reed has gone so far as to use vintage film footage behind some of the street scenes. Truly, ""Down With Love"" is a film-lover's film. It is a period film that combines cinematic techniques and popular themes from both the era that it depicts and the present time in which it was made. And it does so on a grand scale, utilizing fantastic talent in set and costume design, cinematography, and digital effects.

But is it successful as a romantic comedy? I think it is as long as the audience isn't looking for a situation it can ""relate"" to. ""Down With Love"" doesn't take place in the real worlds of 1962 or 2003. But Ewan McGregor and Rene Zellweger throw themselves full throttle into their performances, resulting in characters that are immensely entertaining to watch. David Hyde Pierce of ""Frasier"" fame is brilliantly funny as Catcher Block's employer and friend, Peter. This may be the best work Pierce has done. He tends to steal the scenes he is in, even from McGregor's considerable presence. For ""Star Trek"" fans, Jeri Ryan has a supporting role as one of Catcher's many mistresses, which she doesn't hesitate to play over the top. ""Down With Love"" is a zany battle of the sexes comedy that's as heavy on style as it is on humor. I enjoyed it much more than I do the circa-1960 comedies that it emulates, perhaps because those are just silly, while this is self-consciously silly and brilliantly crafted. ""Down With Love"" won't appeal to people who can't get past the striking set design or period manners. But I found the whole thing a pleasure to just sit and take in.

The DVD: The bonus features include a director's commentary which can be enabled on playback; several television segments that appear in the movie; deleted scenes; hair and wardrobe tests; a blooper reel; documentaries about the film's locations, sets, costumes, music, and techniques; and an HBO special. I recommend the documentaries and the ""Here's To Love"" television performance. This is a cute song and dance number starring Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor that runs during the closing credits, but it's much better viewed full screen from the extras package. All in all, a good DVD package.",1065830400,3,4399,4.823841059602649

1469652,4,B00005JLZW,"The age old and sometimes tired comedy revolving around the battle of the sexes comes to life in a fresh and original way in the romantic comedy DOWN WITH LOVE. Renee Zellweger is Barbara Novack, a woman who writes a feminist manifesto in the early 1960's. Her nemesis is the heartthrob journalist Catcher Block played by Ewan Mc Greggor. The plot of the film is rather simple. Novack and Block each try to discredit the other, but accidentally fall in love. Supporting characters Sarah Paulson as Vicki Hiller and David Hyde Pierce as Peter McManus, friends of Novack and Block respectively, add humor to the movie without taking away from the stars. This is especially true of the character played by Hyde Pierce.
The movie is set in 1962, rather than 2003. This is probably what makes the film work. The viewer automatically thinks of a Doris Day/Rick Hudson sort of film. The film is both a spoof of the earlier films, yet it also shows respect fore the contributions of these films to the world of entertainment.
Of course, whenever a movie is for sale, there is the eternal question: Should I rent it or buy it? Movie buffs will certainly want this film in a collection since it is bound to become a classic. I have now viewed it twice, and I am finding certain one liners in it that I missed the first time, so my verdict is that one should buy it. It's a fun movie that could very well become timeless.",1065744000,,1410,4.51171875
1469653,4,B00005JLZW,"Down With Love was a nice little surprise of a movie that although is not a masterpiece, it is still an enjoyable cute gentle escapism, the likes of which we rarely see these days.
The film is a romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense of the word, clean, witty, and nice to watch, with a fine cast headed by an incredibly sweet Rene Zellweger and a dashingly devious Ewan McGregor,with good support from David Hyde Price, at his neurotic best, and a sexy Sarah Paulson.
Tony Randall makes a very nice comeback, and while his role is rather short, he adds a lot to the movie.
I was very much impressed by the minute details and visible great effort the director Peyton Reed, and production team took to give an authentic sixties setting,atmosphere, accessories and music. While Austin Powers revival of the period was hilarious but over the top, Down with Love delicately put the 'S-es' back in the sixties,
Sex,Style,Swing,and Suave. This revival in my opinion was such a success that I expected Doris Day or Audrey Hepburn to appear in a scene!!
The DVD is loaded with extras, with several documentaries that are very interesting to watch.
So, Down with Love might not be a film that will blow your mind, but it is still a nostalgic ode to the sixties that will leave you with a smile or two.",1065657600,2,1296,4.5665236051502145
1469654,2,B00005JLZW,"Maybe because I love Doris-and-Rock-type comedies, I found DOWN WITH LOVE an absolutely enchanting reworking of the formula, sparkling with brilliant Technicolor-like images, gorgeous sets and costumes, and spectacular CinemaScope (actually, Panavision) photography. I couldn't wait to own the DVD.
Given that audiences in general didn't much care for the story or the genre to make it a hit in theaters, I was seriously hoping Fox would take advantage of the DVD medium to showcase the visual side of this movie. I thought they would perhaps work the picture angle and market the DVD for the film's many aesthetic merits.
Imagine my disappointment when I came home with the DVD today to find the image transfer to be the weakest since, well, the first LAWRENCE OF ARABIA comes to mind: dull, way too dark, extremely soft, weak overall, looking more like a tired VHS tape than a modern DVD.
I was heartbroken.
I just don't understand how these things can happen. I mean, this version of DWL has decent extras, including a director's track. You would think with the amount of work that went into it, someone might have raised a flag, especially since this title is not likely to be reissued anytime soon.
My humble word of advice to anyone with high hopes for this title: beware, the picture quality is so bad it's distracting. If you enjoyed the movie as much as I did, you will find yourself wishing for what could have been and hardly able to enjoy what you've got.",1065484800,4,1467,4.7795275590551185

1469725,5,B00005JLZW,"DOWN WITH LOVE, director Peyton Reed's homage/spoof of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedies of the early 60s, is a delightful bit of fluff in a movie season filled with inferior sequels and overwrought epics. Dazzling to watch, with Givenchy-inspired costumes (if Daniel Orlandi does not receive an Oscar for his work, his peers should turn in their Designer cards), wonderfully over-the-top sets (EVERYBODY in those 60s films lived in apartments you could land airplanes in), and a 'More 1963 New York than 1963 New York' look (created on the studio back lot, with ample support from CGI), the film would deserve a viewing even if the cast never uttered a line of dialog!
Fortunately, the script, by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake, is wickedly funny, full of the politically incorrect double entendres that were as close as Hollywood could get to actual 'naughtiness', 30 years ago (and, yes, there are more than a few present that WOULD have been censored, even then). The story, of a woman who writes a best-selling 'self-help' book eschewing the necessity of men for any more than 'casual sex', and the 'Hugh Hefner'-like writer who turns his prodigious charms to work, in the guise of a naive astronaut, to win her love, and thus discredit her theories, would have fit Doris Day and Rock Hudson to a 'T'. While Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor lack their role models' charisma, they have a pleasant chemistry together, and the 'split-screen' phone call scenes between the pair are even racier than the Day/Hudson 60s versions.
If the leads seem a bit bland, the supporting cast more than makes up for any shortcomings. In a role that SHOULD garner a 'Supporting Actor' Oscar nomination, David Hyde Pierce takes on the part assumed by Tony Randall or Gig Young in those 60s farces, that of the put-upon, neurotic, sometimes prissy friend of the hero. He is superb, even SOUNDING like Tony Randall, and steals every scene he's in. His 'opposite number', friend of the heroine Sarah Paulson, while not quite at Pierce's level, is still quite funny as a chain-smoking career woman who would chuck it all for the right man. And, in a FABULOUS piece of casting, the MAN himself, Tony Randall, appears as the book publisher whose bestseller is RUINING his love life. At 83, the man can still toss off a funny line...
With a very inventive 'twist-within-a-twist' climax, and Marc Shaiman's evocative score punctuating the proceedings, DOWN WITH LOVE is a delight!
Among the additional features that make this DVD a plus for your collection are featurettes about the costume and set design (you can see the joy everyone felt, recreating the era they grew up in), two making-of documentaries, a VERY funny blooper reel (McGregor asks, after blowing a cue, ""Who am I?"" to which an off-screen voice replies, ""Obi-Wan...""), deleted scenes (including one set in a beautifully artificial Central Park), and the musical number, 'Down with Love', sung and danced by Zellweger and McGregor in a mock 60s TV variety show set.
While I won't deny that DOWN WITH LOVE isn't for everyone, if you love a good sophisticated comedy, or those wonderful farces of Day and Hudson, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1064966400,7,3193,4.903881700554528
1469726,4,B00005JLZW,"Renee Zellwegger & Ewan McGregor are 2 great artists having been in an 'era-musical' movie (Chicago & Moulin Rouge), & would possibly have explained why they were chosen for this 'periodic' re-make.
Being set in an early 60's period, the movie both had the look, feel & sound of it.  The setting, the costumes, the way the actors delivered their dialogues, the way they seemed to exaggerate their acting (where coy became over-actingly coy)- were all reminiscent of the old 60's movies.  Even the light plot, including the seemingly complicated 'twist' & how it was revealed, were typical & appropriate for the genre.
Having succeeded in what they were portraying, I should give them 5 stars.  But somehow,something felt amiss --- quite bland --- so a star less.  Down With Love should not be compared though with other contemporary romantic comedies, as obviously this is meant to be characterized in a particular time frame.",1063497600,,926,4.9935064935064934

  Not so good: The writers couldn't decide if they were doing a remake or a send-up; not surprisingly, what used to pass as sly sexual innuendo is now simply vulgar; worst of all, the stars aren't up to the originals. Rene'e doesn't have anything like Bridget Jones to chew on here, and Ewen reminds us that Rock Hudson -- if he was no Cary Grant -- at least had the humorous heft to make this sort of thing credible and fun.

This movie may appear to be just another 60's spoof but is sophisticated in its production, attention to detail, and the performances are sterling. Every head turn by the women and twinkle in Ewan McGreggor's eye is timed to perfection and my imagination was carried away for the whole movie. Of particular delight is the musical number by Ewan and Renee at the end. This is what entertainment is supposed to be about - going out and having a little fun.

Zellweger's character, Novak, tries to change this by writing a book that tells women that they don't have to fall in love to be happy, all they need to do is eat chocolate in order to feel satisfied.  Novak's book becomes a best seller, and the world is quickly turned upside down for awhile.  Women begin sleeping around and the men are shocked.  Novak then meets Catcher Block, the ultimate playboy, who pretends to be a shy and inexperienced guy in order to get closer to her.  There is an unexpected twist at the end, which made me wonder why they had even made this silly story into a movie.  Things at the end seem to go right back to how they were in the beginning.
