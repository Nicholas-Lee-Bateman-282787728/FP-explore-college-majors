1379911,4,B00004Z4U9,"Its from 1960 which explains its 1950s feel.

Its scenery appears amateurish by 2018 standards, but it won an Academy Award for special effects.

Its just creepy that a man in his early/mid 30s & a girl who might be 16 (maybe younger) would meet and fall in love even if it is in the year 802,701.",1521590400,,297,4.192982456140351

1379925,5,B00004Z4U9,"The original 1960 classic sci-fi movie based on the novella by H.G.Wells, is one of my all-time favorites.  It ranks right up there with ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"".  ""The Time Machine"" has its own magical sui generis aura.  On one level, it's a simple formula love story: (Boy finds girl,,,Boy loses girl,,, Boy rescues girl).  On another level,  it's a fascinating look into the intimate relationship of time and space.  (In the story, just a few yards of ground, separated only by time, makes the difference between captivity and freedom). It's also mesmerizing to watch the rapidly changing clothing fashions on a mannikin in a store window as the years flash by.  (The movie won an oscar for the best time-lapse special effects).  On a biological level, the story is an intriguing look at how speciation can occur when a living homogeneous group is separated into two groups and isolated from each other. They can evolve into two different species. (In this story, the Eloi and the Morlocks). And on a global level, the story is a sad commentary on the continually war-plagued human race thru the centuries. The movie springs to life with the enchanting charisma of ultra-feminine Yvette Mimieux and the intensely masculine Rod Taylor.  Their quietly explosive chemistry is supported by a great cast headed by Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, and Whit Bissell.  The timeless musical score is by Russell Garcia.  And the movie was directed by the incomparable George Pal (War of The Worlds. He also designed the Morlocks). The Time Machine deserves a top spot in your classic movie collection.  And for lovers of trivia,,,the voice of the talking rings belongs to the fine actor Paul Frees.",1517702400,,1717,4.944250871080139
1379926,5,B00004Z4U9,"Don't be angry,  but it was also nice to see an all white movie.  I do love the original Time Machine.  What an fantastic imagination to write this at age 29.  Like most modern writers,  they write from things that they probably already seen,  but this was all original!!",1517443200,,271,4.428571428571429

1379932,5,B00004Z4U9,"This is a wonderful science fiction movie in 1960. The first time I saw it was in a matinee, but I don't recall the year. The Morlocks scared me big time though. Some of the Morlock make up is pretty cheesy, but for its time, it was pretty high end. This was a really clean digital copy and I enjoyed watching it over the Christmas season.

1379939,5,B00004Z4U9,"This film took the novel ""The Time Machine"" and gave it teeth.  Nuclear war as an explanation for the creation of the Eloi and the Morlocks provided a better rationale than the original one, which was that the Morlocks, springing from the old working classes, were engaged in reverse class struggle against the former upper classes by eating them as livestock.  Made during some of the bitterest years of the Cold War, one would expect nothing less than the inclusion of nuclear war as the true enemy of both future species, and war itself as the enemy and destroyer of the human race.  No other adaptation of ""The Time Machine"" even comes close to this one.  The horror of realizing that man's inability to control himself in war is what created the sick future dichotomy of the two species descended from humanity is a brilliant insight which Wells could never have fathomed, simply because nuclear weapons did not exist in his time.  But if they had, it is interesting to wonder if his book would have been more like this film.  Watch it.",1511395200,,1041,4.66120218579235

I definitely prefer this to the newer 2002 version (although both have their merits).",1507334400,,273,4.708333333333333
1379951,2,B00004Z4U9,"I watched this because I wondered if it could possibly be as bad as I remembered.
It was.
My objection when I saw it was it's treatment of Weena. That's still pretty bad, but many other bits are quite nasty as well.
OK, ""nasty"" is a bit of an exaggeration. The actual problem is that the film is so firmly targetted at The Greatest Generation (which were the parents raising children at the time) that it just doesn't work for me.

1379967,5,B00004Z4U9,"This is the story of George ""H.G. Wells"" (Rod Taylor) who is an inventor. He has invited his friends to a dinner and is inexcusably late. Staggering in all disheveled he is asked what happened to him. Therefore, he relays the story.

A week earlier, it was the turn of the century. He was showing his latest invention ""The Time Machine."" With this machine, he could go into the future or the past. Being an optimist about mans future he chose the future. The adventure begins.
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the definitive time machine movie. There have been others before and others after ""Time After Time"" (1979). There has been time without machines ""Somewhere in Time""(1980). But just as Cecil's ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), is the version you remember?

There are other remakes or versions of this story made later. The (1978) TV version which did a fair job of portraying the book even if it looked like a TV movie; Priscilla Barnes played Weena. An earlier make of the movie (1949) Mary Donn played Weena. Then they forgot how to make movies and went to today's sound bit razzle-dazzle shallow version (2002) hopefully not the last attempt, looks like Weena is out too.

Rod Taylor's time machine is the one that you remember. An interesting side note is that in the book ""The Time Machine"" by H. G. Wells, Weena was not much worth messing around with and defiantly did not look like Yvette Mimieux.

Later in the story, mankind breaks into two species. The interesting part is that in the book the reason was social. In this movie, it is war and the A-bomb. In future movies, it is eugenics. Given today's climate, it will probably be social again.

Any way I want the fancy time machine and a Morlock suit.",1501200000,,1752,4.78476821192053

1379986,1,B00004Z4U9,"Dont purchase this version!  It is HIGHLY edited and cut to fit on TV (with 50% commercial content).  Many of H.G. Wells main thematic points of the film have been removed because it is so highly edited.  For example; In the uncut version George (Rod Taylor) travels both forward and backwards in time. H.G. Wells puts forward the Thematic dilemma:  Should George travel backwards in time and attempt to fix or put the present in order (end the wars) or travel forwards in time and bring the future, which has been extremely damaged by past wars onto a civilized track?  The editing and cuts have completely removed H.G. Wells thematic question, as all backwards time travel has been removed from the film and no mention remains!  What a disaster to so heavily cut such a great film!  The ending of the uncut version of the film has George (Rod Taylor) finally making his decision to go forward or backwards in time (which has been removed from this cut version).  Again due to the heavy editing a main Thematic Point H.G. Wells makes at the end of the film is complete edited out.  That is to answer the Question:  Is the foundation of western civilization solid and worth re-implementing in the future?  H.G. Wells answers this question with a resounding YES!  So sad to see this completely removed due to editing! In the uncut version, H.G. Wells does not give the viewer a choice as to the main structural element of western civilization but ends the film with a question to the viewer, what 2 additional elements would you introduce into the future?  This of course leads to endless and interesting discussions to viewers of the film. Again, Sadly this has been edited out.  To sum it up, if you have any brain and love science fiction for its ability to create a tapestry allowing deep philosophic questions to be posed then don't waste your money on this highly edited version of the a great H.G. Wells film.",1492128000,,1915,4.643916913946588

1380002,5,B00004Z4U9,My students read the abridged Pacemaker Classic of The Time Machine in class and then watched the movie to compare and contrast the two mediums.  This movie followed almost exactly what my students read about.  It was great to see time change by using a mannequin whose clothes changed as time went by. The Eloi and Morlocks were great representations from the story. My students really enjoyed this movie.,1486339200,,406,4.869565217391305

1380016,5,B00004Z4U9,"Just finished watching ""H.G. Well's The Time Machine"" released by Warner Brothers.
""H.G. Well's The Time Machine"" is George Pal's masterpiece of man's desire to push past the boundaries and limitations of the era and move forward into the uncharted territory of the future.
Rod Taylor brings George [H.G. Wells] to brilliant life as the unnamed time traveler of the original novel who wants to bring back the glorious accomplishments of Humanity's future, thinking that he can alleviate our species tendency for war. Instead he finds that the final atomic war has caused humanity to split into to separate and distinct species, the peaceful, childlike, and ignorant Eloi - who live in the ruins of a once great city and who are kept and used by the Morlocks as cattle.
Perhaps the greatest scene in ""The Time Machine"" is where George is taken to a library and discovers to his horror that the collective knowledge that humanity crumbles to dust at his touch. He wants to lash out at the young man who took him to the library, but can't because the young man doesn't realize the horror that George sees and feels.
It also sets the scene for the end of the movie.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

Beautifully transferred without the over-tweaking and sharpening that is often done on older movies.  It looks clean and natural, just as I remember seeing it at the movies when it was first released. Better by far than my DVD edition of it.  For any fan of this original ""Time Machine"" I can highly recommend it.

1380047,5,B00004Z4U9,"First off let me apologize - I bought this movie over 14 years ago and I'm just now getting around to writing a review:-( So please don't let my oversight deter from the merits of this very-well adapted H.G. Wells novel.

I love reading and this particular story - The Time Machine is indeed a classic. With that said, many of us realize when great classics go to film, inevitably something is ALWAYS lost in translation:-( I will be the first to say that this movie is certainly not as mesmerizing as the novel, BUT, it is none-the-less a great Sci-Fi recreation and especially during it's era - a film released in 1960 based on a novel written in 1895!!!

I remember first seeing this movie when I was a child in the 70's, then again in my teens, but it wasn't until I was a young adult in the military that I actually took the time to read the novel. Indeed if you have never picked up an H.G. Wells novel you are truly missing out on a treat.

Although certainly not as graphic and well scripted or CGI-advanced as todays films, The time machine was truly a movie that evoked curiosity and in my opinion gave children and adults alike of the 60s and 70s the inspiration to dream, wonder and explore paths of technology only imagined in previous generations.......

And as with many Sci-fi creations,  so does this film break boundaries of race, social class, political affiliation, governmental agenda and the boundaries of human survival.

The movie is definitely worth the watch and the DVD version was reproduced exceptionally well; Both audio quality and video in my opinion did not diminish from the story or 1960s ""special effects"":-)

And just think, from that first novel a remake popped up in 2002. Needless to say I bought it as well and enjoy both thoroughly, the movies kept inline with the original novel and blended current events/perceptions quite well with H.G. wells interpretation of humanity's future and our technological prowess.

IMHO this is a movie any and every Sci-fi buff should have in their collection:-)",1481760000,,2037,4.702247191011236

1380066,5,B00004Z4U9,"I bought this on Amazon Video.  Note that what is attached to what is stated as The Time Machine (1960) is NOT the 1960 version but the 2000 version.  That's ok because I would like to own the 3 versions I know about:  1960, the one in the 1970s, and this one from 2000.

There is also a ""documentary"" movie that is related to the 1960s version which supposedly is an additional scene of a return for a short visit to an old friend.  Rod Taylor stars in that documentary and it's quite well done.

But this version of the story is quite well done and includes the perils of attempting to changing time to one's own desires.  Some might find it overly special effect-ed, but I think it was quite well done and addresses emotional issues regarding time travel that the prior version doesn't deal with.  It makes a different view of the story well worth owning the various versions and not just choosing one over another.

This is definitely worth an addition to your collection of science fiction.",1479600000,,995,4.483333333333333

1380106,1,B00004Z4U9,"Even though this page is for the ""Time Machine (1960)""  DO NOT  rent or purchase it in HD as you will instead get the ""Time Machine (2002)"".  The SD (standard definition) version of this is the correct movie, however.

For clarification the 1960 (original) movie stars Rod Taylor and Alan Young and is a five star + movie.  The 2002 (remake) movie stars Guy Pearce and Yancey Arias.

Somehow both the 1960 version and the 2002 version got mixed together on this one web page.  Amazon Video has had the 1960 version available in SD  for several years but just added the HD version in the summer of 2016.  Unfortunately what they actually added as the HD version was the 2002 movie.

Amazon links SD and HD files together within their library system with the base movie in SD but if an HD option is rented or purchased it is streamed at the higher HD quality.  For example, If you already own the SD version of a movie and later upgrade to the HD version your ""Video Library"" will contain both versions but just one link to the web page for that movie.  The link will automatically default play at the highest quality version in your library.

Anyone upgrading ""The Time Machine (1960)"" from SD to HD will be disappointed since only the SD version will play because the link to the HD version is to an entirely different movie.  Anyone renting or buying the HD version for the first time will only see ""The Time Machine (2002)"" in HD.

An interesting side note is that Amazon Video does not even offer the ""Time Machine (2002)"" in SD or HD. It is only obtainable in DVD format.

Amazon has been notified of the problem many times by different people but has not corrected the mistake as of 09-29-16.  So buyer beware.",1475020800,,1715,4.463022508038585

The Moorlocks are supposed to be the bad guys because they eat the Eloi, but the Eloi are all slack-jawed morons, so they're not good for anything *except* getting eaten.

The only thing wrong with the Moorlocks is that they're ugly.

The Moorlocks keep the Eloi alive by feeding them. I don't know why they bother. They should just keep all the food for themselves and let the Eloi starve.

I like that the movie sticks close to the book in the way that the time machine works. In most time-travel movies, the time machine ends up in a different place, not just a different time. That's not just a time machine. It's also a teleporter.

In this movie, the time machine stays in the same spot in England no matter what year it's in. That makes more sense.",1466208000,,798,4.401360544217687

1380151,5,B00004Z4U9,"I may be a bit biased as I remember watching this on Family Classics as a kid but I think this is a great family movie.  If you are into politics - there are also a couple of hidden messages.  For example, the movie was made in 1960 and the time traveler went to 1966 and a nuclear war had started destroying all of Europe.  Then he went way into the future to find the false promise if nirvana, the Eloit people living in apparent paradise.  They were like children with no responsibilities and sat idle as they watched a beautiful girl drowning in the river.  Unlike the nuclear holocaust, this prediction might be true as we see more of the world slip into the false promise of socialism.  We come to find out the the Eloit pay the ultimate price for their apparent nirvana as they are really enslaved by the Morlocks (IE - the providing government).",1463529600,,853,4.367088607594937

He can now manipulate it in much the same way we can use our cars to drive from one location to another. The Time Machine allows Rod Taylor to go backward or forward in time from past to future and as he does so, learns there are many disadvantages as well as advantages in being able to manipulate time, ie; the loss of family and friends.  It is a well thought-out and intelligent journey through time that is both enjoyable and believable.

1380237,5,B00004Z4U9,"BOTTOM LINE: Bold adventure films don't get much grander than this, my friends. George Pal's original version of THE TIME MACHINE is thoroughly engrossing entertainment and perfect family fare for all ages. A truly timeless classic. 5 STARS!

THE STORY: An eccentric inventor living in 1899 England, disappointed in his fellow man and frustrated with the messy madness of modern society, uses his creative genius to construct a machine with which to journey thru time. He travels forward several thousand millennia, hoping to see mankind at last co-existing in perfect Utopian peace... but his idealistic dreams are soundly shattered by what he finds waiting for him in the distant future.

THOUGHTS: An absolute classic of the genre and totally deserving of that claim. George Pal & H.G. Wells make for a sure-fire winning combination. Lots of heart and imagination went into the making of this terrific motion picture. (Light years beyond the anemic 2002 remake.) In addition to telling a fantastic story adapted from the pen of one of history's greatest contributors to speculative fiction, the film also gives us some pithy ideas to chew on as well. Alan Young, Whit Bissell & Sebastian Cabot all turn in fine supporting work, but it's a well-rounded performance by sturdy, square-jawed Rod Taylor as ""H. George Wells,"" inventor extraordinaire, who effortlessly carries the bulk of the dramatic weight in this movie, with more than a little help in the form of lovely Yvette Mimieux as a futuristic damsel in distress; the child-like Eloi girl, Weena.

THE BLU-RAY: Unfortunately, no new content was created for this format upgrade. Thankfully however, the wonderful (if sparse) bonus extras from the DVD version are ported over to this Blu release. Main reason for a double-dip for DVD owners of the film is the audio & video upgrade. Picture here is noticeably sharper than its DVD counterpart. Very little artifacting or pixelation was detected, the blacks are solid & inky and the midtones are firm. The beautiful cinematography & lush visual color pallet are beautifully represented here in this high-def release. The film's soundmix is also strong, solid and even. If you have a Blu-ray player but don't yet own this film then this Blu-ray release is heartily recommended.",1446768000,,2282,5.129032258064516

George Pal's distinctive artistry depicting the scenes of the future ages on earth as they wiz past Taylor's machine and the barren yet beautiful open landscapes of where he finally arrives really draws you into everything. Yes, the whole Morlok ""bad  guys vs. good guy"" thing was clunky and wasted alot of time; but that's Hollywood. And I must say that it was actually Russell Garcia's score that truly made the entire movie so captivating and unforgettable.

1380378,5,B00004Z4U9,"H.G.WELLS' A futuristic novel writer bringing us many imagination busting books including
'War of The Worlds' written in 1898, 'Island of Doctor Moreau' 1896 and 'The Invisible Man'
1897 among many along with this 'The Time Machine' in 1895....what a visionary he really
was.
In recent years a re-make of this film starring 'Guy Pearce' (2002) although this the 1960 film,
is obviously dated by todays standards it is in my view far superior to the 2002 re-make.
The film - 'H.George Wells' -'George' (Rod Taylor) has been experimenting with a machine he
built that he hopes will Wisk him into the future, or indeed the past, same place, a different
time.
'George' plans to take himself into the future, convincing those close to him, friends, of it's reality
and potential is indeed another matter, he fails to convince them.
It's the turn of the Century, New Years Eve 1899 before leaving after the demonstration with a
mini-version passed off by his dinner guests as a trick, his closest friend 'David Filby' (Alan Young)
try's to persuade 'George' not to meddle with the unknown.
'Georg' however is impatient he needs to try out his 'Time Machine' at first slowly, then speeding
the process up, he observes the changes in the surroundings, stopping in 1917 because he could
no longer see out the window, he finds his home is now boarded up, he checks out some of the
changes with bemusement.
His journey had only just begun, he stopped just once more in the 20th Century, he witnesses mass
destruction, finally having whisked through time he halts the countdown forward, the year 802701.
He investigates what first appears to be an idyllic world, however things were not quite as it first
seemed.
The inhabitants the 'Eloi' a passive race were merely awaiting their coming of age to be preyed upon
by creatures that dwell below ground - The Morlocks'
He is befriended by a girl he had saved from the River, 'Weena' (Yvette Mimieux)
This is a strange place 'George' struggles to make sense of what has happened to the World he'd
left behind years before.
He decides he should return to his own time, he has much to tell his sceptical friends, but, his machine
has been dragged behind closed doors in a structure he seemingly couldn't enter.
'George' is about to learn the reality's of the time he's now in, things are about to become clear.
The visual-effects of this 1960 movie were indeed pretty impressive for that time, we take Computer
Generated Imagery for granted these days......this, then, was quite something to marvel at in truth.
The picture and sound quality has received a credible upgrade.
The film is currently available on the 'Blu-ray' format (Import) on 'Amazon' ....the good news is that the
film is 'Multi-Region'
Well worth both viewing and owning.

* Behind-the-scenes documentary 'Time Machine' The Journey back, hosted by 'Rod Taylor' and

When you watch this movie you have to remember it was made 55 years ago and considering the lack of technology like the one we have today they did a pretty good job.  The movie is family friendly.  It has a love story, two separate factions of humans (one above ground and one below ground), and a world where everything is supposedly like a garden of Eden.  Or is it?  We had a fun time watching it.",1430697600,,540,4.254901960784314
1380490,5,B00004Z4U9,"One question which has got me puzzled is, what do the Morlocks actually manufacture with those machines?  Don't know if the book has the answer but the movie
certainly doesn't.  Sunglasses would be very practical for the Morlocks' use although the machines don't seem to be the right shape for that.

Those who love this classic as I do will probably want to take the plunge and get blu-ray.  Be advised, however that the blu-ray picture for
Time Machine is, at least on a 39 inch TV, not substantially better.  Colors have better depth but picture is only a little more detailed.  A main strength for the blu-ray is sound.  The music really has presence, and fans of Russell Garcia's wonderful score will want blu-ray for the excellent music reproduction.",1430697600,,756,4.769230769230769

The character of Weena is the perfect blend of innocence and youth to create the idea of the Eloi as both mindlessly passive and yet sympathetically human.  Rod Taylor hits the mark as the idealistic Victorian age scientist dumbfounded to find the both the near and far future are disappointingly violent.  The movie does not have the rapid whirl of CGi effects of a modern film - some viewers might not like the measured pace of older films such as this, and, as many cold war era science fiction films, it can be a bit preachy, but overall a solid movie that has stood the test of time.",1427241600,,803,4.555555555555555

1380646,5,B00004Z4U9,"""The Time Machine"" is a real classic. I had recorded it from TV once, but I wanted an original because it has an interesting feature about how it was made; I always like the ""the making of..."" special features. Anyway, this is the original 1960 version of the movie, and it is wonderful! There is no CGI special effects, just a story with a lot of character development. I have seen the 2002 remake once, and while it is good, seeing it once was enough for me. If I like a movie good enough to want to see it more than once, than to me it's a great movie and justifies five stars. And I have watched my recorded copy many times over the years and this studio release twice so far. I'm a post war baby boomer who grew up watching the classic sci-fi movies of the 1950s and early 1960s as the local theater's Saturday afternoon ""monster matinee"" double feature (yes, there was once a time, way back when in the old days of the fifties and sixties when you actually got to see two movies for the price of a ticket.

1380824,2,B00004Z4U9,"A loose adaptation of the HG Wells classic that's glaringly fifties in all the wrong ways. Weak special effects, atrocious acting and a few heavy-handed additions to the plot are just the tip of the iceberg. There's also a serious lack of science in this sci-fi endeavor; particularly bad is the scene where our narrator stops off in the middle of the Cold War, observes a tactical nuclear strike (literally annihilating buildings across the street) and strides through a few wisps of smoke back to the relative safety of his device. Rod Taylor is fine in the leading role, strong, smart and confident, but he's just about the only player worth his salt and the rest of the cast hams it up badly. And even he can't spin gold from straw with some of this dialog. It does have moments, and there's a weird allure to Taylor's relationship with a child-minded girl of the future (who smiles blankly as he rambles on, using words she clearly doesn't understand), but too often it goes the flashy route, especially in the big climax. There's a lot of depth and nuance in the novel, but you wouldn't know it from this take.",1422835200,,1116,4.613065326633166
1380825,5,B00004Z4U9,"George (Rod Taylor) is an inventor living in Victorian-era London. On the last day of 1899, he invites friends to his home to witness a demonstration of the first time machine as a small model. Most of his friends remain incredulous about the claim, but George is adamant about his invention. He confides to one of his friends, David Filby (Alan Young), that he is disappointed with what he sees as the war-mongering people of his time. He resolves to travel to the future to witness for himself the progress of mankind.

This movie is a true classic of the science fiction genre. To start off with, the special effects in this movie are fantastic as they are employed to depict the passage of time. Taylor does a good job in his role as the leading character.

1380847,5,B00004Z4U9,"I first saw ""The Time Machine"" when I was 8 years old, when it originally appeared in theaters, and it instantly became a lifelong favorite. Watching it again many decades later, I can see that it retains all of its charm, warmth, and wonder. Rod Taylor was the perfect lead -- handsome, stalwart, but also sensitive & thoughtful, as befits his character -- and Alan Young was a perfect match as his closest friend. In fact, the depth & strength of that friendship is one of the things that stayed with me the most.

Of course, younger audiences will probably scoff at some of the special effects, particularly the miniatures. For me, these only add to its appeal -- and in any case, the stop-motion effects for the time travel sequences remaining beautifully effective, far more so than any CGI to my mind. And the overall design is superb, from the cozy, civilized Victorian drawing room to the properly ominous, menacing, and somewhat alien sphinx that watches over the entrance to the realm of the Morlocks. And the time machine itself is a marvel of delicate steampunk beauty.

It can rightfully be argued that this is a family-friendly version of the classic Wells novel -- much of the bleaker aspect of the original is missing, and it ends on more of a hopeful note than the novel. But that really doesn't matter. Taken on its own terms, the film delivers in every way -- from thrilling adventure, to sense of wonder, to mind-opening ideas the viewer can ponder afterward. Add to that the generous helping of extras on the disc, including a short sequel of sorts filmed years later, with Taylor & Young returning to their old roles as if they'd never left. Their affection for the film & its creator is evident in every frame.

At some point, someone may well film the original novel faithfully & do it justice. I'd like to see that! But this version is definitely a keeper, both as a beloved childhood memory & as a strong, exciting story that that any adult can enjoy as whole-heartedly as any child. In any era, this is solid film entertainment at its best -- most highly recommended!",1421107200,,2094,4.638814016172507

Scary & monstrous sci-fi with a hint of Victorian England sophistication thrown in to boot. As a kid every re-run was anticipated with glee - it is just so exciting & engaging.  No remake has captured the energy or sincerity of the George Pal model and Rod Taylor is just great as the protagonist, George - presumably Herbert GEORGE Wells - but myself being an Aussie I'm a bit biased I suppose.

1380931,5,B00004Z4U9,"Sometimes the subject of a film is such that the 'stars' of the film become inconsequential.  Here, the concept of a time machine is so awe-inspiring that we don't worry about what actor is portraying what role.
George Pal was the great director of sci-fi in the 50's and early 60's before Stanley Kubrick.  This film chose to make the technology not leading edge/state of the art, but instead a 'period piece' almost antique, reaching back to the time of HGWells(who wrote the original story.)
The plot has a man travel the timeline of our planet, from past to present to future, seeing an evolution of mankind which gets very unpleasant indeed.  He's not supposed to intervene or affect those time periods, lest he unravel the timeline, but given a chance and a good reason, he just might do it.
Time travel is beyond our comprehension now, pure fantasy.  However, there is hard science that might make it possible, the unintended consequences of that unknowable.  Suffice it to say, this film is not a dry scientific treatise but instead a very warm, involving, and exciting look into what might be possible if we could, indeed, travel in time and, more importantly, actually change history.",1418688000,,1194,4.833333333333333

On thing I have noticed on this, and other recent blu ray transfers is, if I have the Edge Enhance feature enabled on my TV, it introduces a lot of what I would call 'digital noise'. Almost like film grain, but you can tell it's digital. When I turn that off it goes away.

Today they want all sci fi movies to be wall to wall action, this was a movie that told a story and let your mind work not just fill your eyes with special effects instead.  It was and is still a entertaining story that takes place in 1899 and into the distant future.  Fun to see what was going through our minds in the late 50's as the movie released in 1960 and in the future the world has a nuclear war that destroys it in 1966.

1381032,5,B00004Z4U9,Excellent movie.  The Blu-ray version certainly exposes the miniature models.  With today's technology there would be no problem.,1415836800,,129,6.111111111111111
1381033,5,B00004Z4U9,"I still recall being enthralled by this film in its initial release. I saw it at my neighborhood, single-screen theater as the top half of a double-bill. Right from the first, the clocks and the title and the music set the tone that carried the audience through to the future. For an hour and a half, time itself was suspended. This is a classic film, rich in story telling fantasy.

And, waaay overdue, it's come to Blu-ray. It's never looked looked or sounded better in home video. The image quality is solid and the sound is clear. With that being said, there is room for improvement.

Image Quality 3.5/5
The brightness levels of some of the night and underground scenes need to come down about an f-stop. This is crucial for the setting of these scenes, to obscure some painted backgrounds, and to provide stark contrast of darkness and light, both physically and metaphorically. The colors are good but lack a certain richness. The image lacks theatrical clarity. A higher bit-rate would not be remiss -- there's *lots* of room left on this disc.

Extras 3/5
The special features are ported over from the DVD without any upgrade. The Time Machine : The Journey Back is informative and enjoyable. The basic single trailer is good. A separate film score track would have been good but it's not here. Also not here is any commentary track which is a shame because the excellent Rod Taylor, stalwart Alan Young and talented Yvette Mimieux are still with us. Some background commentary could be pieced together from scattered sources. The Alan Young narrated story is not here either. No booklet, insert, mini-poster, etc.

Audio 3.5/5
The 5.1 audio is front weighted with dialog never lost in the mix. Don't expect bass booming, immersive sound from this era unless the film is a big bucks Ben-Hur spectacle. Pal always did wonders within a film's budget and this was not a big budget film..

Packaging 2/5
The disc cover leaves room for improvement. I wish studios would use the original poster graphics for their disc covers. In this and other  regards, Warner Archives is exemplary, their ""Out of the Past"" release is a great example. I really wish the WB DVD Special Edition packaging with extras were repeated for this release. That was an awesome, exemplary release.

Overall 5/5
I am severely biased. This *is* a film classic and it's the film that counts. This *is* a distinct image quality upgrade over every previous release of this title and I am glad to finally have it on Blu-ray. Very highly recommended.",1415750400,,2520,4.779310344827586

1381035,5,B00004Z4U9,"I have seen this movie at least 40 times since I was a child, at the theater, on VHS and regular DVD. The Blu-ray version is, by far, the most beautiful copy of this film I have ever seen.  It's hard to believe it was released in 1960 it looks so good. George Pal did indeed produce and direct a timeless (no pun intended) classic.  This non CGI'd masterpiece can still amaze and enthrall, if you have little ones (6 to 10) they will love this film. This version is 100 times better than the remake with Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons.  This isn't about reviewing the film, this is for fans who are already aware of it.

Like another of Wells' story-to-movie, The Invisible Man, this is an enjoyable translation and an absolute classic. Rod Taylor's performance as The Traveller was as well done as fans of his work might expect. It's much different from the Guy Pearce film, but seeing this should explain some of the influences it has over the remake. This is a better adaptation of the original story, and still a treat to watch so many years after it was made.",1412380800,,533,4.5625

Director and creator George Pal does a great job in bringing to the screen the H.G. Wells Novel that creates this storyline.  Special effects are done well given what was available during the time period this film was made - not as in todays CGI super computer ability for special effects - but still good enough.  The storyline relates to life of yesterday, present, and our questionable future that leaves us with a message relating to the attitudes of ""we"" humans in our future that we may be moving towards.  George Pal also did the special effects in the original War Of the Worlds (Gene Barry - circa 1953), another Classic Movie.",1411948800,,750,4.616541353383458

1381189,4,B00004Z4U9,"Sometimes I wonder if it is worth it to replace a DVD with a new blu-ray reissue.  This blu-ray of ""The Time Machine"" still has all that soft blurring that you usually get with your DVD.  It's easy to forget that it is a blu-ray disc because it doesn't look that much better than my DVD. And I'm not too particularly fond of the movie cover on this new blu-ray. The artwork on the DVD box was so much more cooler. So, that's another disappointment here.

Oh well, as usual though, we tend to replace all our DVD's with blu-ray releases because sometimes, there may be a slight improvement. Small though that improvement may be.

This blu-ray may be worthy of selling for about ten dollars, but as you can see as of this date, it is still selling kinda high for what wasn't much of a remastering effort at all. Yes, I know it is a very old film. But I have other blu-ray of films released around this era that look a great deal better than this blu-ray release.",1411257600,,960,4.287292817679558

like a littie more presence in the rear tracks , but, over all the sound track was prety good and the Picture was Great, they the right amount of graineness to the transfer to make it look about right ,more like what 50s movies would look like.

1381255,5,B00004Z4U9,"Today I received my new Blu-ray version of this movie, and watched it tonight on in my home theater. One of my favorite sci-fi movies and a classic in every sense of the word.

I have watched this movie several times on TV and have owned the dvd version for several years. But nothing prepared me for the breathtaking and brilliant experience of seeing this movie as it must have looked when it first was shown in theaters back in 1960.

Like dusting off a jewel that has lain neglected on the shelf for many years, finally we get to see George Pal's vision as it was originally intended to be seen!

The colors are fresh and vibrant. You can see it in the ""dome"" scene, where the fruits on the tables look so real you could almost reach out and grab them.
The high resolution shows details in the Time Machine itself that I never new were there. Obviously a great deal of care has gone into the restoration of this for the Blu-ray release.

The sound is vibrant and sparkles brilliantly. It is in the full stereo as it was when the movie came out.

I have seen this film a dozen times, but watching it last night was like seeing it for the first time again.

If you have a home theater, get the Blu-ray. If you don't, try to see it at a friend who maybe has one. This is a movie that HAS to be seen in high-def and a large screen to truly appreciate.",1409529600,,1351,4.176923076923077

This extra documentary is so cool and features amazing facts and history, plus original stars Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Whit Bissell circa 1992. If that's not enough, the incredible Bob Burns is on hand as a major player in the documentary. It's a celebration of George Pal, the crew, the machine, the whole experience. Not to be missed. Trailer also included. Meanwhile, the movie itself is, of course, awesome, and looks very fresh and rich color-wise, and the sound is terrific. Entire cast is great, and I'd forgotten that Doris Lloyd plays the housekeeper. She's a featured player in many Universal monster classics: She played Mrs. Williams in ""The Wolfman"",  the nurse in ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"", etc..

The ""What If"" question of going back and changing events in time is intriguing. H.G. Wells comes up with a masterpiece. This is one of those classic movies you shouldn't miss in your life. It's December 31, 1899 and the Time Machine is ready for a ""trial run"". After having some of his friends over for a little surprise demonstration on a lower scale model of his making, he is convinced that the ""bigger"" machine will be a success. He sets his sights for the future to see what the decades hold in store for all mankind. He soon finds out what lays in the future is bleak and full of war and destruction. He eventually finds a peaceful race called the Eloi, centuries ahead in the future in the year 802701

Unknown to him for a time is also a race of beings called the Morlock's. These are the mutated humans that have taken refuge in the underground caverns and ""feed"" off the Eloi themselves.  George has found himself in the middle of two separate races, one dependent on the other for survival. He intervenes with success and eventually frees the Eloi from the dreaded Morlock's.

Actor Rod Taylor gives a splendid performance as the lead actor and hero. Yvette Mimieux also does a great job in her role as Weena, one of the Eloi.

1381418,5,B00004Z4U9,"THE TIME MACHINE [1960] [Blu-ray] You Will ORBIT Into The Fantastic Future! Stylish! Charming! Continuously Exciting!

Here today, gone tomorrow. When George [Rod Taylor] sits at the controls of his new creation, he has all the time in the world. He's invented a Time machine that whisks him from 1899 to war-ravaged moments of the 20th Century and into 802,701. In that far-off era, passive Eloi face a grim future as prey to the glowing-eyed subterranean Morlocks . . . unless the time-travelling stranger from the past intervenes.

At the controls of the 1960 movie of H.G. Wells' classic The Time Machine is effects trailblazer George Pal, whose features and short films won a combined Seven OSCARS and Special Awards. One winner was the beloved adventure loaded with visual marvels, from the nuclear destruction of London (complete with lava eruption) to the colourful whirligig of time travel.

FILM FACT: Awards and Honours: 1961 Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects winner for Gene Warren and Tim Baar. 1961 Nomination for Hugo Award. The film received an OSCAR for time-lapse photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly. George Pal always intended to make a sequel to The Time Machine, but he died before it could be produced; the end of Time Machine: The Journey Back functions as a sequel of sorts. In 1985, elements of this film were incorporated into The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal, produced by Arnold Leibovit. George Pal was already known for pioneering work with animation. He was nominated for an Oscar almost yearly during the 1940s. Unable to sell Hollywood the screenplay, he found the British M-G-M studio friendlier, where he had filmed Tom Thumb.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Set in the Victorian era, George Pal's production of The Time Machine [1960] is a faithful adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel in most respects except one; it omits the author's cynical observations about the British class system. Yet it's the main premise that has captivated audiences for years: A scientist George Wells [Rod Taylor] creates a time-traveling machine that carries him forward into the year 802,701 where he finds a strange new world populated by the Elois, a passive, peace-loving race, and their predators, the Morlocks, a cannibalistic tribe that lives underground and is light sensitive.

Although not lavishly produced, George Pal's 1960 version of the H.G. Wells classic `The Time Machine' dazzles with a battery of clever special effects. The key to the Jules Verne successes was the appeal to a wide audience. George Pal gambled that H.G. Wells' name would pull in the same crowds as did Walt Disney's major smash `20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.' George Pal was on a roll at M-G-M. Already famous for his Puppetoon short subjects, he'd inaugurated the science fiction craze ten years earlier with three Technicolor hits. Given the boot from Paramount after the failure of `Conquest of Space,' he turned his energies away from space fantasy. George Pal's M-G-M hit `Tom Thumb' put him back on track with the studio brass.

`The Time Machine' begins in a period setting, England of 1899. H. George Wells [Rod Taylor] demonstrates his newly invented time machine, hoping to interest his stuffy friends in the wonder of visiting the future. Disillusioned by their inability to see beyond petty comforts and war profiteering, the pacifistic George Wells bids his peers farewell and takes a trip forward in time, very tentatively at first. Everything he sees is warped by war. His dear friend David Filby  [Alan Young] dies in WW1. A 1966 war with nuclear satellites effectively ends civilization. George Wells stops far in the future, in the year 802,701. The Earth has become a Garden of Eden. He discovers a strange society of beautiful but passive people called the Eloi, none of whom seem to be over twenty years of age. He meets the comely Weena [Yvette Mimieux] but is disenchanted to find that the Eloi have lost all knowledge of independence, curiosity, and chivalry. He then learns that this paradise is actually a human stockyard. The Eloi are pampered and husbanded as a food supply for the subterranean Morlocks, hairy green monsters with horrible crooked teeth and glowing eyes. Seeking to inspire men of his own time, George instead becomes the warrior-emancipator of a remote future world.

`The Time Machine' is easily George Pal's best directed movie, and with the exception of `The War of the Worlds' [which I wish they would release on a Blu-ray disc] is his best overall. It was a solid hit in the 1960s. Barely heard were the misgivings of sober critics that decried George Pal's diluting of H.G. Wells' original story. In 1895, the Darwinian idea that Capital and Labour might devolve into separate species of men was intellectually controversial. H.G. Wells had used it as a political critique of his times.

George Pal and screenwriter David Duncan retained H.G. Wells' narrative framing device of the two 1899 dinner parties, but greatly altered the Eloi of the 803rd Millennium. H.G. Wells' Eloi are a depressing race of slight and effete midgets that resemble miniature deer on two legs. When trying to communicate with them, the original Time Traveller, who he had no given name in the book, has zero luck getting much further than hello. This lack of satisfying human contact simplified Wells' storytelling chore while making his adventure more like a waking nightmare than a journey to a faulty Eden. The events in the book are also more depressing. The time traveller has a soft spot for Weena, but as she's only quasi-human, the romantic angle is lacking. George begins as a typical English tourist in a Third World land, shocked by everything he sees and having a tough time coping with anything un-English. Within 24 hours he's spearheading an Eloi revolution. It's a good thing that George returns to the future, as the Eloi are apparently incapable of doing anything for themselves.

Taken by itself, most of George Pal's `The Time Machine' is dead on the mark, entertainment-wise. 1899 is neatly sketched with just a few scenes. His actors have clear parts to play, and the explanation of the Fourth Dimension communicates well even to children. Alan Young is solid as George Pal's moral anchor, affecting an endearing if hammy Scots accent. Four years earlier, the under-appreciated Rod Taylor had a featured role in a space film involving involuntary time travel, `World Without End.' Rod Taylor showed considerable charisma as George Pal's hero, becoming a rare case of an actor helped rather than hindered by being cast in a science fiction film. Yvette Mimieux was only seventeen during filming.

George Pal did a good job matching the appropriate effects to his story, given the lowly status of film effects at the time. Unlike some science fiction pictures, `The Time Machine' required something new and creative in almost every scene. The big studios always preferred the control factor of keeping the work on the lot, but by 1960 M-G-M's crafts and effects departments had been whittled down to nearly nothing. The most the studio could offer was the back lot and giant warehouses of props and costumes.

Seen today, The Time Machine remains a reasonably elaborate affair, with impressive production values and fine special effects. The Moorlock makeup is reasonably frightening (in part because their scenes are filmed mostly in underground darkness), turning them into memorable movie-monsters. And there is a decent amount of spectacle special effects tricks for the eye, including the destruction of London by an exploding volcanic eruption (the lava was made out of oatmeal dyed red), nuclear bombs and the hideous appearance of the Morlocks (green latex skin and grotesque masks fitted with electrical eyes, courtesy of makeup artist William Tuttle). Cinematographer Paul Vogel worked out a lighting scheme to indicate the advance of time as Rod Taylor travels into the future on his ""barber's chair""; a clear gel was used for daylight scenes, a pink one for dawn, an amber one for dusk, and a blue one for night. These were synchronized on a seven-foot circular shutter rotating at varying speeds to simulate the movement of the sun through the roof of the Time Traveler's greenhouse as the machine advances into the future. Other time changes were represented by blue-backed traveling mattes (the sequence where Taylor is entombed in rock) and the use of numerous background sets which were double-printed with scenes of the traveller in the stationary time machine. The film even has a fair degree of visual poetry, as when the time traveller asks to learn more about the Eloi by looking at their books: an Eloi takes George Wells to a dilapidated library and hands him an ancient volume, which promptly crumble into dust in his fingers. George Wells concludes ruefully that the books do, indeed, tell him all he needs to know about the Eloi.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video's Blu-ray is really superb, with minor caveats to be discussed herein. For starters, this encoded image 1080p presentation is only single-layered and if available disc space exists, it should be utilised to the. `The Time Machine' was shot on a fairly miniscule budget; its 1.85:1 aspect ratio image lovingly exported to hi-definition with all of the inherent flaws of its original source material intact. We are at the mercy of these original elements; the image weaving back and forth from razor-sharp clarity to fairly thick and occasionally blurry inserts; mostly in the shots heavily laden with matte work and other SFX effects. Also, colour can waffle from vibrant hues to marginally less than; flesh tones looking relatively accurate in one shot, but then adopting a faintly orange tint in another. Again, this is NOT a flaw of the Blu-ray transfer. Neither is the slight gate weave that could have, and should have been corrected! Overall, the image here is gorgeous and impressive; advancing in sharpness and colour saturation and providing an exemplar of what good solid video mastering entails.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Better still, Warner Home Video has given us a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio remix, enhancing the vintage 4-track Westrex recording is a modest affair, retaining the original's front orientation and using the stereo separation to expand the presence of the brilliant Russell Garcia's [Perry Mason] orchestral underscore sounds for the time travel device's characteristic sound effects, is absolutely marvellous. The war sequences and the confrontations with the Morlocks have relatively limited dynamic range by contemporary standards, but the dialogue is always clear. So top marks for effort.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Behind-The Scene Documentary: Time Machine: The Journey Back. Directed by Clyde Lucas [1993] [480i] [47:43] This documentary was originally on the earlier inferior NTSC DVD. The 1993 production is a valentine to film craftsmen that genuinely love their work. After an overview of George Pal and the film, the show tells the tale of The Time Machine's title prop from construction, to auction, to its rediscovery in a thrift store and reconstruction by some dedicated effects people, including the brilliant fabricator-artist Tom Scherman. The haste and bluntness of studio work can be judged by the fact that as soon as the throne-like Time Machine prop had finished shooting, it was sawed apart to film inserts of its control panel. Nowadays there'd be three sturdy props with breakaway variations; the original Time Machine was a delicate construction that barely lasted through shooting.

The documentary features the noted monster-maker and prop collector Bob Burns, but also details other effects processes. At one point Gene Warren talks about a talented painter whose canvasses were animated as he painted them, to produce images of foliage growing and such. If I'm not mistaken, some close-ups of leaves and apples growing during this explanation are really like the animation you get with the George Pal's familiar Puppetoon variety. Later on the documentary shows views of entire landscapes changing with the seasons, and an Eloi dome being built, which Savant thinks correctly illustrates the work of the skilled painter.

The Journey Back includes a newly produced scene between Alan Young and Rod Taylor reprising their characters. It starts well but doesn't add up to much beyond making us wonder why sequels to `The Time Machine' were never made. With both Rod Tayor and Yvette Mimieux still with us, a sequel would seem a natural, especially in the early 1970s when George Pal was in a slump. George Pal apparently floated a number of scripts, but nothing ever came of it. One reason for this might have been the notion that shows like `The Planet of Apes' series and television's `The Time Tunnel' had left George Pal's simple 'go there and come back' plotting far behind. It remained for Zemeckis and Gale's clever `Back to the Future' films to rediscover and mine the time travel concept for general audiences. The film won a Saturn Award and a Television Award.

Theatrical Trailer [1960] [480i] [4:3] [2:31] This is a very flat transfer of an excellent Original Trailer for The Time machine is included.

Finally, `The Time Machine' is one of those essential science fiction films of all time to have in ones Blu-ray Collection, and Warner Home Video Blu-ray, has come up trumps, despite the age of the film and certainly no film has more influenced the cinematic sub-genre than George Pal's 1960 adaptation of the novel, which fired the imagination of generations of future filmmakers. Even today, when many of his sequences look slightly primitive by comparison to modern effects, others still hold up, because they rely more on creativity than technology. But us fans of this type of genre film do not mind, as again we know how old the film is and in the past the film studios did not know what a wealth of classic films that they had in their vaults and tended to let the negative rot, but of course if at the time the film studios knew of the coming of the Blu-ray format, they would of taken better care of these brilliant classic Hollywood Blockbusters. Because rarely has anyone come as close as George Pal to conveying the child-like wonder of how it might feel to pass through time without being affected by it, watching it accelerate and decelerate, reverse and proceed, as easily as one might navigate a vehicle through space, when we viewed the film on the big screen, when we came out of the cinema, we all wanted a time machine and what wondrous possibilities we could achieve. Again, despite the age of the film, I think it is a really beautiful copy and on my set up it looked stunning and I am now so proud to have this brilliant classic George Pal sci-fi film in my Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

1381420,5,B00004Z4U9,"Finally another one of George Pal's masterpiece fantasy films gets the Blu-Ray treatment. The film is a classic bit of late fifties science fiction, the kind that Pal excelled in for most of his entire career. I remember seeing this in the movie theater when I was just five years old. It made quite an impression on me then, especially the scene of the sped up decomposition of the Morlock. It scared me so bad I had the hiccups all night! The Blu-ray transfer is impeccable. Great resolution, rich colors and perfect contrast. If there is one slight draw back with HD it is found in older films that relied on blue screen and old fashioned in camera composite techniques. Unfortunately all the flaws that film grain and 35mm film to screen size enlargement blurred out are all too clear at home in 2014. But, so what?

1381436,5,B00004Z4U9,"Producer George Pal made a series of science fiction films in the 1950s using the best special effects of the time, all in color, and nearly all well-received. Two of those works were ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine.""  With the release of ""Time Machine"" on Blu-Ray, it is probably only a matter of time before ""War of the Worlds"" will be released in this format. ""Time Machine"" is more faithful to H. G. Wells' book, but ""War"" was a better movie. That said, ""Time Machine"" is an impressive work, from its casting of Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux as the leads to its sets which evoke a sense of pre-World War I England to the far future. When I first saw this film, I had not read the book. The subtleties of the Morlock-Eloi relationship escaped me, as they are downplayed in the film. Well's social commentary, the backbone of the book, can't really be depicted on screen. Still, this is a great film, and shows that it was possible to get beyond the standard science-fiction fare of giant insects and odd visitors from space  even in the 1950s.",1405728000,,1056,4.494791666666667

1381438,4,B00004Z4U9,"One of the most-treasured films from the classic era of science fiction cinema finally makes its debut on Blu-ray.  For anyone who doesn't already own it, it's certainly a must-have for your video collection.  But for those of us who already know and love the film, and have previously bought the DVD (and the VHS as well, for us long-time fans), the question is: Is it worth the upgrade to Blu?

The answer is. . .maybe.  I buy ALL the classic sci-fi films on Blu-ray when they become available, and I already own well over 100 of them on DVD.  And I would estimate I've watched The Time Machine DVD at least 10 times.  And while the Blu version IS a slight improvement in terms of color and clarity, it's hardly the best upgrade I've seen.  Typically, even with the limitations of its source material, many classic-era films really shine in the format when it comes to bright, outdoor scenes.  So when inventor George Wells (spoilers! ha ha) lands in the sunny, tranquil world of the Eloi, I really expected the colors to pop off the screen.  Sadly ,this was not the case.  The picture DOES look great. . .just not quite HD great.

On the other hand, the audio is superb, probably among the best of heard for an older film.  The sensitive and at times soaring soundtrack really shines through, even in some of the quieter moments.  Dialogue is clear throughout, and the overall sound mix is just right.

Extras are carried over from the DVD, and include the great ""Journey Back,"" which is a combination of documentary and scripted follow-up to the film.  Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Whit Bissell briefly reprise their roles, as we learn what happened to George after he went back to the future.

Again, if you don't already have it, Blu-ray is the way to go.  And if, like me, you're a huge fan of the film, you'll probably want to upgrade anyway.  But for the casual fan, or anyone expecting a major improvement over the DVD, you might want to pass.",1405555200,,1951,4.525714285714286

""The Time Machine"" has changed hands from MGM to Turner and again to Warner.

It's unclear what survives from the original negative, interpositive or prints for the film but the Blu-ray looks slightly better than DVD. There are plenty of scenes though that appear soft and don't have quite the resolution one might expect even for a 54 year old film. Still, what we do get looks handsome with bolder, strong colors, solid blacks and some nice textures  with the film grain kept intact for the film. For those interested the bit rate is a little bit under 20 Mbps which normally would result in a weaker transfer with some video noise. Thankfully, there isn't video noise here but the bit rate is anemic.

The audio transfer sounds extremely good with a repurposed 5.1 soundtrack (I'm not sure what the source was--the original stems or the mono soundtrack if the latter, they've done a good job of giving the soundtrack more depth)that adds separation and power to the music score for the film. Dialog is clear throughout the presentation and subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish, German SDH.

The special features have been carried over from the previous DVD release. We get a 47 minute mixture of documentary/extension of the film entitled ""The Journey Back"". Here actor Rod Taylor appears both out and in character. In the case of the former, he provides background on the making of the film including interviews with the effects artists that worked on the film and, in the case of the later, we get a 20 minute ""sequel"" to the original film reflecting some of Pal's intentions for an unproduced film that he was shopping around almost all the way until his death. We also get the original theatrical trailer for the film. The special features are presented in 480i.

It's a pity that Warner doesn't add any special features to the film. It would be nice to have a commentary track or a documentary on Pal's life but I'm happy that we get the special features ported over rather than the feature film only.

Not knowing the condition of the original negative, interpositive or various prints out there (or even if the original source elements still exist), it's hard to judge what Warner did here. The blu-ray IS an upgrade from the DVD but it is a minor upgrade. Colors are bold, blacks are solid, grain is intact for the film and there's little to no video noise that I noted on the Blu-ray vs. the original DVD.

Audio sounds pretty good although one should temper their expectations because the film is over 50 years old.

""The Time Machine"" remains a  terrific film and it's one of Pal's best.",1405209600,,2892,4.710891089108911

The blu ray presentation was a disappointment ,this is not an upgrade but just a mere standard dvd  transferred over to blu ray format. As A matter of fact the standard has more clarity in picture and sound than the blu ray,another one bites the dust but it still gets a 4 star rating for a magnificent George pal's the time machine.

It's magical.

There were 2 matinees a day in the summer of 1960
and I sat thru this movie maybe 8 times in one week.

I will start with the audio quality. The soundtrack remastered sounded amazing compared to the previous version and brings Russell Garcias score to life and the abrupt change in sound from before is much more tame. Now the video. No one expected a miracle with a 54 year old film bht this could have been much better. In some places it was over enhanced and takes away from the vison of george pal.

But back then, I didn't know the difference  between a matte line and a clothes line and all I could think of was throwing Morlocks around a grotto for months afterward. We got the Morlocks (Taliban) and the Eloi (spring break college kids who don't know who bombed Pearl Harbor; go to a beach and ask one) sooner than we hoped. And now with the Blu-ray, we finally notice the sign in Filby's selling ""tubeless TV's"". The Blu-ray is less than you wanted but more than you hoped.

I saw this when I was 10 yrs old and was hooked on not only the movie but the wonderful H.G. Wells novel about the possibility of time travel.

Beautiful Weena showing our intrepid time-traveller the old historical ""rings"" and how, when spun, they told the story of civilization's future collapse...

The menacing entrances to the morlock's subterranean world...

Wow again.

I'm not sure whether I knew who Producer George Pal was back then--of course, I do now--and I never saw War of the Worlds in a theatre (too young, said my parents!) but saw it later on TV.  With these two memorable movies, the guy sure demonstrated that he had his Sci-fi chops down, alright.

This was likely the high point of Pal's career, although he kept at it, and was at work, planning and pitching, when he died 20 years after making this classic movie (more Oscar-winning effects!)  We should all be so lucky.

Witty, believable dialogue, too--even at 14, I got that bit! Lovely stuff.

Of course, I was also a sucker for Pal's later movie that has been savaged by critics then and since: Atlantis, the Lost Continent, made on a shoe-string budget, recycling wardrobe, sets, props and footage from better, bigger block-busters.

Still, when that futuristic vessel docks at Atlantis...and when the buildings tumble and fires rage...Wow again.",1401926400,,1421,4.92436974789916

1381580,5,B00004Z4U9,"I've loved this film since seeing it in the movies when I was ten years old.
Produced and directed by the great George Pal and based on the novel by H.G. Wells, the film begins on New Years eve 1900 as four friends (including Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot and Whit Bissell) await their friend George at his home for dinner.  George arrives late, dirty and disheveled, and tells them an amazing story.  George (no last name is ever given) has invented a time machine and has taken it into the future.  Among the things that he witnesses is an atomic war that lays waste to London in the year 1966! (At least, that never came true.)  He eventually winds up far in the far future where he meets the beautiful and helpless Eloi and the underground dwelling mutants, the Morlocks.  I won't go further for those who have not seen the film.
The heroic George is played by Rod Taylor, who with this film and Hitchcock's The Birds, became one of my favorite actors of the 1960s.  The special effects of the years changing won the Oscar for Best Special Effects of 1960.  (I once met Alan Young and mentioned how much I loved this film.  I got the impression that he didn't think all that much of it and he mentioned that it was a very low budget film.  You could have fooled me about that, this does not look like a low budget movie at all.)
I have always loved the end of the film with Alan Young leaving Taylor's house for the last time as the snow falls and the new century begins, accompanied by the film's lovely music.  It is a wonderful and sentimental moment in a lovely film.  There have been so many wonderful fantasy films that I loved growing up: Journey to the Center of the Earth, Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Harryhausen's films, Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and so many others.  However, this is one of the absolute best.  I've owned it on VHS, I own it on DVD and I will probably own it on blu-ray.",1397520000,,1931,4.330555555555556

  However, in retrospect, the 'Eloi' depicted as totally submissive naive 'children' without intelligence or moral fibre seemed
  a bit unrealistic considering they were still supposed to be human.
  And it was surprising to see that a man's idea of physical perfection/beauty for the human race was still boys & girls with
  blonde hair and blue eyes. Sound familiar (Aryan?)?

1381632,4,B00004Z4U9,"I grew up watching George Pal's masterful film adaptation of the H.G. Wells classic novella, and have seen it more times than I can count (I just watched it again during TCMs tribute to the Oscars-this film won Best Visual Effects for 1960). Wells was quite literally a time traveler himself, but that's another story. Reading Wells story, it's amazing how close Pal stayed to it.

The acting, visual effects, plot, and pacing are wonderful, and hold the viewers interest from beginning to end. I've always felt Rod Taylor was the perfect actor for the part of the Time Traveler (H.George Wells in the film, as shown on the medallion on the creative Victorian-looking machine). Taylor is ably supported by a skeptical Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell, and Alan Young as Filby, Wells' good friend who finally accepts his seemingly far-fetched story in the end. A very young Yvette Mimieux does a creditable job as Weena, the naive Eloi woman who befriends Wells more than 800,000 years in the distant future.

The film does a great job depicting humanity's future of war, conflict, and survival. The separation of mankind into the two separate species of Morlock and Eloi are striking, with one major flaw: the Eloi are shown as blonde little white people. Racism was largely the order of the day during the Victorian Era in which Wells wrote his story, but one would think George Pal would have progressed a little by 1960. Even though in my opinion the 2002 Guy Pearce remake isn't quite up to the standard of this film, I think the makers understood that humanity is headed in a more blended racial direction.

That gaffe aside, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I feel it is one of George Pals masterpieces, along with ""The War of the Worlds (another Wells story)"", and ""The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao."" I've always wondered what 3 books I would take if I were going to try to build a new society 800,000 years in the future...",1394236800,,1932,4.659824046920821

The sets and scenery still look pretty good. Too bad they couldn't update the sound to multi-track surround, even so, the soundtrack is still good, the dialogue very legible and the music fits well.

I imagine it was a little ahead of it's time back in dark ages when it was filmed.  Everything was trucking along rather well, plot, character development...and then I fell asleep.  I woke up late for work, rushed out of the house and didn't return for at least 18 hours.  My job sucks.  I fell asleep before I remembered I had a movie rental in queue.  So, the next day when I finally remembered I was watching this wonderful movie, I was forced to make a decision...fork over another $1.99 or never find out what happened.  Did I mention that I am far too lazy to ALT-TAB and google it.  So, in the end, I decided it wasn't worth a sum total of $3.98 to find out what happened and I moved on with my life never giving it a second thought until now.  I think I'm satisfied with my decision.  Although, if the admins read this and want to give me credit for another movie rental then I would definitely finish watching it.

1381658,5,B00004Z4U9,"The movie lived up to my expectations.  Although the props were amateurish and the acting was questionable,  in my memory as a child I found it exciting and it did pay homage to H.G. Wells,  a man way before his time.",1391731200,,217,4.2439024390243905
1381659,5,B00004Z4U9,"Even if this film is now 54 years old, it still remains amongst the best SF films ever - and definitely the best adaptation of novella ""Time Machine"", a great old classic written in 1895... Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at a house located near London, but their host, H. G. Wells (Rod Taylor), whom they usually call George, is absent. As requested, they begin without him, but then George staggers in, exhausted and shocked, wearing dirty clothes. He claims thet he just came back from a time travel to the most distant future... And then the film begins.

Although old and using antiquated special effects, this film is nevertheless a most excellent thing, which I watched recently with as much pleasure as when I saw it the first time on TV as a child in the 70s. As most people know the greatest part of the time travel described in H.G. Wells story occurs in year 802 701AD, a time in which humanity is divided into two different sub-species, the beautiful vegetarian Eloi living on the surface and the monstrous cannibalistic Morlocks who hate sunlight and dwell underground.

Well, here the story was a little bit changed but it actually did this film a great deal of GOOD as the main hero has to stop a couple of times on his way to 802 701AD - and those added chapters are excellent! Once we arrive to the era of Eloi and Morlocks, the film returns to the original story and does it with considerable fidelity, even if here also some changes were done, making this film somehow less pessimistic and cruel than the novella.

The strength of this film is not in the speciall effects, but in the story, the dialogs, the general atmosphere and an excellent performance offered by Rod Taylor and also by the leading lady. Yvette Mimieux who plays Weena, an Eloi girl George meets in 802 701AD, is a splendor to contemplate and even the story doesn't offer her too many good lines to say, she portrayed the main female character very skillfully. One can simply not help but like Weena and I started to be very concerned for her safety from the first second I saw her - and there are reasons to be concerned...

The one thing that is missing here are those pages of the novella which describe the dying Earth 30 million years in the future - in the film the hero doesn't go that far. However, the very ending of the novella is present in this film - and it is a great and very, very touching moment.

Bottom line, this is a GREAT film, which (other than in the special effects) did hardly age at all. A recommended viewing. Enjoy!",1391644800,,2620,4.493697478991597
1381679,5,B00004Z4U9,Great syfi. don't make em like this anymore. Great it's day and one you'll want to own. Same with the original War of the Worlds. A must for those of use that were kids in 60's,1391299200,,176,3.9166666666666665
1381680,5,B00004Z4U9,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, and was thrilled and amazed. That was many years ago. But I just saw this again and it is still a delight, though maybe not quite as awe inspiring to my elder mind.

This is a movie I recommend for several reasons:

The production quality is top notch - if the version you have is faithful to the original - some digital copies apparently don't work well. The original production was lush and rich in the true MGM tradition.

The costumes and sets are classic. When ""George"" (Rod Taylor) is in the 19th century, everything looks the part, with lush surroundings and rich textures.  When he is in the future, everything looks properly futuristic for the 1960's design concepts.

The time machine itself is a movie prop icon. Yes, Back to the Future's DeLorean is cool, and the glass-and-brass time machine of the 2002 version are also very cool, but THIS time machine is classic and vintage. At the time, it was an amazing design for a movie prop and certainly was true to the spirit of the 19th century. I place it up there with Disney's Nautilus and Robby the Robot.

The actors are excellent. Rod Taylor makes a great time traveler (at the time, he was the hunk de jour) and beautiful Yvette Mimieux captures Weena's beauty and innocence. At the time she was an up and coming starlet, and I think this role really helped her career. The supporting cast (including Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissel and Allen Young) of character actors were some of the best of their day.

The music is sympathetic to the action, it supports it instead of over rides it, and the main theme is a bit haunting.

The special effects. At the time, no one had done such elaborate time-lapse photography, and it took a lot of work and time to prepare the time travel scenes. In the 1960's this was totally ground breaking and it is still wonderful to watch. Yes, there have been plenty of other movies that feature time lapse photography since then, but this was one of the first major theatrical releases to feature this costly effect. It is a highlight of the adventure.

The overall feel of the film. This is a Romantic film (Romantic, with a capital R meaning, not lovey-dovey, but in the style and sentimentality of the Romantic period), with a softness and emotionalism that typifies the Romantic literary period. Wells wrote it during that time, and the film does honor the spirit of the book, even if they get some of the story turned around.

On the downside:

The script, while very good, does lose a bit in translation from the book. Rod Taylor's time traveler is too judgmental of the Eloi and Morlocks, but Well's character is less so. He is more on the adventure, accepting what comes. Also, they avoided an important part of the book. Near the end, the time traveler journeys even further into the future, after the Eloi, and sees the end of the world itself. It's very bleak. MGM decided to by pass this probably because they wanted to offer a ray of hope for the future.

Overall:

This movie is a classic and well worth watching. It was great then, it is great now.",1391126400,,3091,4.527827648114902

This was the third listing.. ecstatic that the price was only $7.99, I thought to myself, ""WHAT A DEAL!"", so I immediately purchased it and had it overnighted, sadly they do not offer over night for three days ago (It IS a time machine.). I really needed to get back to 2000 to make some changes in my life. Changes such as, not investing my life's earnings into Pokemon and selling ""I survived Y2K t-shirts"".
After realizing that this was in fact a book, and not a time travel machine, I did not read the book. However, I did watch a movie on Time Travel, and it was excellent. I highly recommend it and give it five stars. After some self reflection, I also realized that the year 2000 was a pretty worthless year, and it would quite possibly be the last year I would ever choose to back in time to.",1381622400,,865,4.280487804878049

The Eloi all look alike, which makes sense for a people that are bred as one would breed animals.  I've read reviews that criticize the Morlock makeup and costumes but I think they are pretty OK.  I wouldn't want to meet them, either in the dark or daylight.  The performances are all excellent and the DVD is fine quality with the original poster on the case.  Like many of the George Pal films the story has an element of sadness and regret with the ending giving one hope for the far distant future.  One of the best.

Though it begins on New Year's Eve 1899, it is actually a view of man's fear of an atomic war in 1960, the year the film was made. However, it goes far beyond pointing fingers at goverments, to the very nature of man and his stuggle with the loss of recorded history. I've been showing this movie to my students in high school for many years, At the start they think it's 'hokey', but in an instant, they are enveloped with the struggle between the innocence of the Eloi and their cannibalistic nemesis the Morlocks.",1379116800,,692,4.3307692307692305

1381827,5,B00004Z4U9,As a fan of the British show Doctor Who I must from time to time give a nod to HG Wells for his venture into time travel science fiction.  Most people wonder what the world will be like in the distant future.  Some of us wish we could take a look at the past.  The Time Machine was the first major story that made our imaginations explode with the possibilities of exploring those periods for ourselves.  As always the movie and the book don't perfectly match but the film's casting is very well done and its special effects and visual effects were pretty good for 1960.

But seriously, if you like action/sci-fi, you are more than likely going to love this! Rod Taylor is one of my favorite actors, but I think his best role yet was in ""The Birds"" by Alfred Hitchcock.

It's because we get to look back 50 plus years in time to clothing styles, hair styling, and acting in 1960 and get to watch a classic as well.  Why the five star rating.  I was 12 years old when I saw this the first time and it shaped my future in instrumentation so it is worth having just to remind me of my beginnings.

1381863,5,B00004Z4U9,"This movie is based on the book written by H.G.Wells which is also the name of the lead character. It begins at the end of George's adventure with his retelling of those adventures of traveling through time. That is why as you see these events unfold you also hear the character commenting on what took place. George's narration is well done it does not interfere with the story as some narrations do but enhances it.
  George is a scientist who is of the opinion that man in the future will have done away with wars, disease, and even poverty. He is so sincere in that belief he creates a time machine. When the machine is created George begins his time travels. Together George and the audience witnesses the effects of time on his surroundings. One of my favorite scenes is the changes that take place in the dress shop window across the street from George's house. Just by watching the changes of fashion you as the audience gets to see how much time was passing and of course watching George's reaction is amusing. The special effects by today's standard isn't great but the film offers the best effects of it's time(no pun intended).
 George ""parks"" his machine tens of thousands of years from now. To George's horror he finds that man has developed into two groups one group literally feeding on the other. The cannibals live underground the group that is being fed upon lives above ground. Another point that disturbs George is how ignorant the above ground humans have become not knowing how to read or write they have allowed man's written legacy to turn into dust. Just as he makes the decision to go back to his own time ""feeding time"" begins and a group of above ground humans are taken underground including his new friend weena. The rescue makes the eloi realize there is another way to live other than as the morlock's food.
 After George tells his story to his unbelieving friends realizes he has a responsibility to the eloi so after saying good bye to his closest friend he uses his time machine one more time, this time taking three books with him. The movie leaves you wondering what books did George take, well what three books would you take to reeducate man?",1371600000,,2182,4.615979381443299

As an Orson Wells flick I guess it was ahead of its time compared to horror movies nowdays.

Rod Taylor is fantastic and the Time Machine itself is a work of art.  The morlocks, although nothing like the book, are so cool.  I always wondered how they made the eyes glow.

As handled here, this movie is both exciting and fanciful; I greatly enjoyed watching it.  If I have any complaint at all, its trying to get around the use of Alan Young who sounds like Scrooge McDuck (so surprise there) throughout.  Its a bit jarring.
Otherwise, this is a fun film, with a goodly amount of Oscar winning special effects well used.  I find the story a bit sad though, because ostensibly, it concerns a man (Rod Taylor) who really doesnt fit in anywhere.  His small circle of friends are totally disengaged, lost to their own interests, unable to respond to his.  He goes forward in time and meets the Eloi who are totally disengaged, lost to a life of leisure.  He doesnt really fit in with them except as an elder statesman who wants to improve their minds (which is a worrisome thought as it depends entirely on his values).

A man leaves a house and walks on a snowy street on December 31, 1899. He arrives to join others around a dinner table. They wait on a man. They are startled when a man walks in the door! George tells what happened. Time is the Fourth Dimension, it cannot be seen of felt or modified. Movement in the fourth dimension is impossible. George opens the box to show a small model of his time machine. Can a man change the shape of things to come? [Yes, its going on as you read this.] The model machine is turned on then disappears from the present! George explains ""Time changes Space"". He plans to travel to the future. Does this violate the Laws of Providence? David Filby says ""destroy the machine"".

George has a full-size time machine in a room. He gets in it and pushes the lever to observe the effects. [Time lapse photography produces special effects.] He watches the changes in dress styles. He stops in 1917. His house has changed. [No new occupants?] An automobile is in the street. He meets James Filby, David's son. He learns about current events. ""What war?"" He returns to his time machine to proceed to the future. In 1940 the War with Germany is fought with flying machines. Next it is 1966. A siren sounds, people run to shelters. Modern automobiles are in the streeet. ""You haven't changed."" Building crumble from the enemy attack! Volcanic eruptions follow! Hot lava flows! Centuries of darkness follow. George walks around this new world. A paradise? Where are the people? A young girl is caught by the current. George dives in to rescue her! People ignore this even. Apathy? The use of tranquilizers?

Why did he save her life? They go inside, its getting dark outside. George asks questions. ""Why?"" ""We have no government."" ""There are no laws."" George asks many questions. They have books, they are crumbling into dust! George wants to return to his past. His machine has been moved inside a fort. He sees figures lurking behind the bushes. Weena warns him against the Morlocks and the night. They don't know fire! Does self-sacrifice belong only to humans? ""There's no past. There's no future."" [Are they like animals?] Weena talks about ""talking rings"". They tell about the past, before three centuries of warfare. What happened to the young people who were taken? ""I'll be back."" Sirens sound, the Eloi walk to their destination (drawn like teenagers to tabloid television). George follows along. """"What happened to them?"" Did they learn from the past? ""They never come back.""

George enters that well to explore the underground. He finds skeletons on the ground. Whips drive people into a cave. Fire drives away the Morlocks! ""Get the torch!"" The Eloi run to escape to the surface. Back to the river. The earth collapses! George seems to be trapped in the future. He can't return to warn people about their future. Weena asks about George's past. Then George finds his Time Machine, fends off the Morlocks, and starts it forward, then back to 1900. He enters his home to find his friends. ""It's a ridiculous story"" says his friend. Where has he been for the last week? ""Goodnight George."" David Filby returns to find George gone with his time machine. Can the Eloi build a New World? Three books are missing from his library. [What three books would you take back to the future?]

Widespread atomic war would not just poison the world with radioactive fallout but also create a new ice age from a nuclear winter that would kill off most of the survivors.

They even do a short skit where Taylor attempts to rescue Alan Young's character from his date with destiny (tries to stop him from leaving for France, where he was killed in WWI), which gives fans of this great film one extra moment with the Time Machine cast members.

Perhaps that is what drives your obsession with time, the devices that measure it, and the desire, above all, to invent a machine that will allow you to zip through the centuries to a more peaceful and saner era. . . .

Tucked away in your solarium, you have crafted such a device.  At first glance, one might think it was a one-man sleigh, with bent brass bars, a red-velvet chair, and a large odd-looking concave copper disk just aft of the traveller's seat.  When the disc spins, the encoding on its rim ( 1 4 2 3 1 4 5 1 etc. ) activates the machine like the prongs on a music box; the faster it spins, the faster it moves through time.

You take a seat.  The controls are simple.  Firstly, you activate the display circuits; the switches are on top of the control cylinder in front of you:  yellow is for the ""days"" indicator, green for ""months"", and red for ""years.""  Secondly, you reach down underneath the cylinder and switch on the machine's motive power.

To the right of the display is a polished green-mineral lever topped with a faceted quartz knob.  You push the lever upward, the disc spins, the display flutters future dates, but on each stop in the 20th century you find war; you push the lever to its max.

When you stop, you find what you were looking for:  a society that is at peace, no war, but when night comes, you discover that fear rules, and in the day, when the siren calls ... well, the attrition of the flocks of humanity goes on, even in the 8028th century. . . .

This story - and nothing we currently know, I imagine, will still be remembered in 800,000 years. H.G. Wells's predictions will not be judged. But in the meantime, it was still an incredibly fun story.

The only thing I found disturbing was that the Eloi came across so heartless. They were on the surface a peaceful people, but didn't have any attachments to each other. They were unconcerned when they lost members of their own families. Even in 800,000 years, I don't really buy that people would evolve to that point.",1338336000,,1359,5.258064516129032

1382180,5,B00004Z4U9,"I'm a big fan of the late H G Wells. My favorite  science fiction novel by H G Wells and movie of his is The Time Machine. I've watched the movie dozens of times. I love great science fiction and this movie on DVD INMO is in the top 5 science fiction DVDs of all time! Look at all the 5 star reviews by other reviewers! Rod Taylor as the time traveler, Alan Young playing two roles as his best friend and his friends son,Sebastian Cabot and the hottie Yvette Mimieux as innocent and loving Weena in the Earth's far distant future are superb in their acting.

The color and sound on the DVD are great. This movie won an award for its London nuclear destruction with molten lava scenes. George Pal who created the movie won seven Oscars and Special awards for his various features in other works.

We see the time traveler at the very end of 1899 explaining to a group of friends the 4th dimension Time and how it can be used to move objects into the past, present and future. He sends a small model of the time machine into the future. His friends are not impressed as they think it could be a trick and see no commercial application for a time machine.

The time traveler goes into the future with his beautiful made Time Machine. First he sees only ahead a few hours, then days and WW1. He stops and looks around. Then he goes into WW2, stops and looks around. Then he  stops and sees London in 1966 being destroyed by nuclear war weapons and molten lava engulfing everything. Quickly he jumps into the time machine and just escapes being burned and buried alive by molten lava. He travels many, many centuries into the far future and finds and lives with the innocent nice Eloi race and saves his future sweetheart innocent Weena from drowning. The evil subhuman horrible looking cannibalistic Morlocks capture Weena and many of the Eloi to eat them. The time traveler must rescue them. I won't ruin the great super ending.

This is classic QUALITY science fiction put together on a great playing DVD. Great color and sound. Lots of action and a great story plot. Buy this to add to your collection. INMO one of the best 5 science fiction novels and movie of all time! Rated 5 stars plus",1324944000,,2189,4.419354838709677
1382181,5,B00004Z4U9,"THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday, then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again.

Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind, the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life. My own wondrous ""journey into the future"" via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s, and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions.

This is a film that truly delivers.  The special effects are outstanding...the acting superb...the drama riveting!

Rod Taylor, as the inventor of the time machine, is relentlessly -- believably! -- heroic in the role of H. G. Wells; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena; Alan Young's sensitive portrayal of David Filby (the only one of Wells' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells' ""outlandish"" theories) makes a lasting impression on the viewer.

And one of the major, not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia, which I'm listening to now as I write this review. The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama, while the ""London"" theme tugs gently at the heartstrings. (There's one gorgeous passage here that's straight out of Debussy.  Has anyone made note of it?)

Don't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world, and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago.",1324425600,,1751,4.9965635738831615

The Special Effects done by George Pal demonstrate his usual excellent work.  They are a little dated, but taking into consideration that the film was made in the early 1960's they are outstanding for the time.  The Morlocks look a little cheesy, but if one ignores these minor details, the film is a real treat.

1382252,5,B00004Z4U9,"""The Time Machine"" is a lovingly faithful reproduction of H.G. Wells' famous novel of the same name.  Rod Taylor is the Time Traveler, who has, in the year 1900, invented a time machine that can travel forward or backward in time.  He travels 80,000 years into the future, to find.... well, that would be telling, for those few readers who do not know the story.

This one still has the magic that it had in 1960 when it first came out.  The special effects, while nothing startling by today's standards, are nonetheless not bad, and this is still a beautiful film to watch.  The story is compelling, and clearly told, just like the Wells novel.  In point of fact, this film shows that it does not take 2 1/2 hours to tell a great story.  This one does so in approximately 1 hr. 40 minutes.  This one never slows down, and continuously holds the viewer's interest.  Rod Taylor is terrific as the Time Traveler.  The ending, (no spoilers here) is actually even better than that in the book, and this is the only material place in which this film departs from the novel.

1382255,5,B00004Z4U9,"The History Channel's ""Exorcism: Driving Out The Devil"" documentary is one of the best and one of the most frightening television specials on the subject of the supernatural ive ever seen. Im a huge fan of ""The Exorcist"", yet there are some people out there who probably think the film's subject of demonic possession is a product of screenwriters' imagination; the truth is, demonic possession is a very real phenomenon. It does happen, and throughout the centuries, there have been recorded cases of people whove been possessed by evil spirits going back to the days of Jesus Christ, who was the world's first exorcist. Among his abilities was being able to cast out demons, and this documentary discusses this in full detail, as well as Him teaching it to his disciples, and The Church later practicing the ritual down to the present day. We see how the ritual was even used as a political tool during the Middle Ages, how it was used during the time of the famous Salem Witch trials, through to the 1949 case of the young Maryland boy exorcised of demons by Jesuit priests, which was studied by a young Georgetown student, William Peter Blatty, who years later would write the popular novel and the Oscar winning film based on the case, The Exorcist. It profiles theologians, doctors, historians who study and/or practice exorcism, including the Rev. Bob Larsen, one of the leading exorcists in this country.

actors playing the roles after all these years,  but it could be done.

1382277,4,B00004Z4U9,"After all these years, ""The Time Machine"" (1960) remains a very entertaining movie.  Of the five or six films produced by George Pal, ""The Time Machine"", which was also directed by him, along with ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) are probably his finest films.  Both films are loosely based on the novels of H.G. Wells and, for their time, boasted state of the art special effects, for which both films won an Oscar.

Rod Taylor is the lead character, supposedly H.G. Wells himself, who claims to his friends to have invented a time machine, allowing him to travel back and forth in time.  His brief discussion with his friends, attempting to explain the principles of time travel, similar to the Wells novel, makes it seem almost plausible until one thinks about it a little longer.  Taylor,  whose British accent slowly fades away as the picture goes on, plays his character earnestly and is surrounded by an able cast:  Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, Whit Bissell, Yvette Mimieux, Doris LLoyd, very likable as his house maid, and, in particular, Alan Young, who delivers a perfect Scottish accent, as his devoted but practical-minded Scottish friend.  Why not? Alan Young grew up in Edinburgh.

The special effects for this film are basically simple but effective, using time-lapse photography to simulate the acceleration of events that one would supposedly witness if he were rapidly moving forward in time.  His journey, after a few brief stops to observe the two World Wars and a nuclear attack pointedly set in the mid 1960s, ultimately takes him several hundred thousand years into the future in which he encounters a race of ""beautiful people"", the Eloi and a race of barbarous beings called the Morlocks who are (literally) living off the Eloi.  At this point the screen play of the picture and the novel of H.G. Wells part company, the movie pretty much resorting to melodramatic action for its resolution.

The video quality of the DVD is very good and the sound recording, as a pleasant surprise, is in genuine and high quality stereophonic sound although it was never presented that way in any theater in which I saw this film.  The music is a rich orchestral score by Russ Garcia and adds a good deal to the effectiveness of the film.

I thinks it's safe to say that this film version of the Wells novel, with all of its shortcomings, still betters the 2002 remake in spite of the technical superiority of the newer film.  Alan Young makes a brief but welcome cameo appearance in the 2002 film which, unfortunately, fails to convey the atmosphere of H.G. Wells that the older film, at least in places, manages to accomplish,",1282003200,,2637,4.803097345132743

1382284,5,B00004Z4U9,"I saw this as a boy and it permanently entered my imagination.  If there was one wish that I could have had, it would have been to have a real machine like the one in the film.  I added the film to my collection so that I could share it with my children.

Watching it at this age, I must say that there is still magic to it.  In particular, the sense of history passing so quickly, seeing where the path of man might lead.  The scientist truly still captured my imagination - his inspiration, his wonder, his hopes, his regrets, his struggle against smaller minds.  That part worked for me as it did in 1964, when I first saw it.  I also enjoyed his discovery and investigation of the Eloi, who to his horror had devolved into passive children living only in the present, using only present-tense verbs.

Unfortunately, the part with the Morlocks appeared preposterous and crude to me, a kind of tack-on to the great first hour of the movie, to make it an action movie in its last 25 minutes.  It is fun, of course, but there is nothing distinguished about it and the end resolution is way too pat.

And my kids (g14 & b10).  With the special effects nearly 50 years old, they were not impressed.  They also did not get swept up in the themes the way I did, again with a mix of sophistication and impatience with the slower pace (the Star Wars infection, I would call that).  But we did discuss it, even if they laughed at it for the most part.

The extras of my edition are also OK.  Though the documentary has too much about the fate of the prop time machine, there is also a fictional vignette conclusion that is truly worth the price of admission.

Warmly recommended.  I guess I'm dated in my kids' eyes, but I am still a sucker for it and glad of it!",1264636800,,1756,4.2727272727272725

1382324,4,B00004Z4U9,"When I was a kid I can't recall how many times I watched this film on the television, but it was always among my favorites. It still is.
What's great about getting older is how your experiences can actually improve on something that's already among your favorites. Sadly, it also diminishes some of the things you thought you liked.
Everything about this film now has the weight of emotional maturity working for it. Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world, even for what he thought was a brief trip, holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then. That's especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event. This film opens with a restless man stuck in an age, his age, where he despises man's futility but accepts that life amicably enough.
It ends in a similar manner but now that man holds a sense of purpose, a goal he has set and will fulfill to the best of his ability. He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive.
The FX of this film are dated. They have to be. But the story itself is timeless. Forgive the pun.
The one disappointment is the battle towards the end. The Morlocks are not as scary as before. They're just as vile, but pathetic. I also wish George Pal had insisted on a scene from the book where the time traveller sees the future after the Morlock time when the sun is dimming.
Anyway, this has worn very well with age.",1246924800,,1445,4.3357933579335795

1382326,5,B00004Z4U9,The Time Machine (1960)was an excellent five star movie produced by George Pal starring Rod Taylor. This old movie has held up pretty well with the passage of much time.  I first saw it at the Loews Paradise in the Bronx back in 1960. Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film. Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective.  The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story.,1243814400,,538,4.479591836734694
1382337,4,B00004Z4U9,"Boy, did a nice DVD transfer like this one  not only make me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better, too, for some reason. I only acquired the DVD as a memento, so to speak. I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s: Yvettte Mimieux. She still looks great, too.

Since time travel stories also fascinate me, my favorite part of the film is when ""George"" (Rod Taylor) is actually in his time machine and experiments with it, slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII. Then, he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack. (Apparently, scare-mongers back in '60 thought that was a short-term likelihood.)

Anyway, when ""George"" (H.G. Wells, the author of this story) finally stops, in the year 200,000-something, the story loses some of its momentum. However, it's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people. Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed.

The message I got on this last look is that man is still man, meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good, and to put one's faith totally in man is a mistake. It's only going to lead to disappointments as ""George"" found out on each of his stops. (Notice he never stopped during a peaceful, progressive period.) Yet, ""George"" is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better. There's always hope for a better world and people like George, with his idealism put to action, can make a difference.

Overall, an entertaining and thought-provoking film.",1243555200,,1762,4.598726114649682
1382338,5,B00004Z4U9,"Several 3rd grade classes in my school viewed this movie (rated G)after reading a version of the book.  We'd read it chapter by chapter and reviewed with EOG-style questions.  Wow-talk about a page-turner!  The children could not wait to read the next chapter just as soon as we finished the last.  Watching the movie was a fun way to see the images we'd created in our minds come to life.  This was the original version (I think the best) and because it is rated G, I felt very comfortable showing it to my students.",1243209600,,517,4.457446808510638

1382340,5,B00004Z4U9,"The chronological setting of the movie is New Year's Eve 1899.  George Wells (named in honor or the author of the original book) is just hours from seeing another century.  But he is not satisfied with that, nor does he have to be.  He wants to go many centuries into the future.

The H.G. Wells book this movie is based on was written in 1895 close to when this movie is set.  It was also the first story of time travel by mechanical means.  ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" written by Mark Twain six years beforehand was about time travel via a bump on the head.  In fact it was this book that coined the phrase ""time machine.""

The movie closely follows the book except that it takes advantage of knowledge of 20th Century history not available to writers in the 1890's.  When traveling into the future George stops during the two World Wars and the year 1966 which was a future year when this movie was made.  Then he narrowly escapes a nuclear blast.  This encases him and his machine in rock forcing him to continue traveling into the future until the rock was worn away over time.  He stops in the year 802,701.

George expects to see new inventions and progress.  He is shown some advanced technology but not much.  What he first sees is a lush garden and people, all blond and young, living in leisure.  It appears that mankind has found a way back to the Garden of Eden.  But something is just not right.  For starters they do nothing when one of them is drowning in the river.  The time traveler rescues the woman whose name is Weena and asks about her people's ""rather curious attitude.""

 He finds out more about these people.  They are called the Eloi.  There are people underground called the Morlock.  But they do not look anything like the Eloi.  These Morlocks are blue skinned, big eyed, monstrous looking people.  Over time the human race has divided into two species.  The Eloi have everything provided to them by the Morlocks but they pay a price for it.  They all must eventually go underground to be eaten by the Morlocks.  They respond to a siren with the exact same sound that civil defense sirens have been sounding since the beginning of the 20th Century.  The time traveler had heard this sound during his stop in a World War II air raid and in the 1966 nuclear holocaust as people were being warned to seek shelter.  Apparently people had been so conditioned to respond to that sound by going underground that the Eloi were doing so mindlessly.

H.G. Wells was concerned about the working class increasingly working underground.  In this story, this perceived trend of his has progressed to an extreme.  There is a lot more to this story than someone going into the future and seeing new gadgets.  On top of being a fun movie, it is rich in social commentary.  The movie gives one the experience of traveling with the main character.",1243036800,,2876,4.538011695906433

1382344,5,B00004Z4U9,"This particular adaptation of H.G. Well's novel, though not entirely following the text's plot, seen more times than memory serves, will never lose its appeal, its mystic qualities nor its political ramifications.

In the novel, the protaganist, a scientist of great passion, grows posessed to go back in time and prevent the death of his true love. He attempts to prevent her death many times, but she dies anyway despite his efforts under different circumstances - ""one cannot prevent fate""?

Rod Taylor does a supurb job as the curious scientist, moving into future time, as we see 1960 special effects of fashion changes, and the creation of the horseless carriage. He moves forward with great pace as the earth is destroyed by man. Thousands of years pass, as the rocks of centuies finally disapate to find himself in a kind of paradise, where berry's are the size of soccer balls.

Later we find the earth is divided into two types: Eloi & Morlock. The dominant class, (Morlock) and the slave class, (Eloi) as the Morlock's supply the basics of life for the apathetic Eloi, only to exploit them for their own ends. Sounds familiar?

Here comes the protaganist to save the day, going back in time to tell his story to his colleagues.

The protaganist goes forward in time to create a ""new way of life"" for the Eloi, however, he only takes one book with him, and the audience is left wondering what book it could be.

If you were in the same situation, what one book would you take forward in time to create a new civilization?

A favourite as a child, (book & novel) this film has always continued to be food for thought and a personal sentimental classic.

1382345,4,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is great although maybe for different reasons now compared to when it was first released in the 60s, the special effects have not stood the test of time very well, but because it doesn't take itself too seriously there is much fun to be had watching blue bodybuilders wearing mops on their heads, a lava destruction sequence that was done filmed with your basement train set and hot jam and where the harebrained futuristic people are all blonde!, all makes the Time Machine a must see and eons better than its remake.

Before the turn of the 20th century George Wells builds a time machine and instead of going into the past decides to visit the future. His journey leads him to meet with children of his friends from the past, multiple world wars and a future society where humanity has speciated into two opposing groups. Can George prove it all happened and can his machine change fate? If you like any sort of corny classic film then The Time Machine is a whole bag of that and then some more. It might not have heavy duty thinking behind it like Forbidden Planet, and watches much like an extended episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, but at the same time is its own film in its own unique way.

1382357,5,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is one hour and forty-three minutes long and was released on August 17, 1960. The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells (George to his friends) who invents a time machine. George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future. The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive. George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm. Just at the four guests are about to dine, George enters the room dirty and clothes torn. George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine. When the four friends leave the house, George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature. At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12, 802,701. George lands in an almost paradise world. The only downside is that there are two different classes of people. The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws, government and civilization. They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well. The Elois speak in a childlike way. The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground, operates the machinery, blue-skinned, and cannot stand the light. The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks. The Morlocks clothe, feed, and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults. George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end. When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from. George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from. His four friends do not believe his story, but David Filby seems to believe some of it. The Time Machine won an Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects (1961). The Time Machine is a great science fiction movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.

I still love this film though, lets face it, it would be easy to make a monkeys arse of such a great story but the directors hand is firm, and the little touches that make this film so good are so enjoyable. The tailors dummy with the changing clothes, the spinning discs that provide the back story for the Eloi, its wonderful. My own childhood niggles such as the lack of interest of his colleagues and the lack of surprise of the Scots ginger-haired chap who meets him twice ""in the future"" annoyed me a little, but these are tiny glitches. Make no mistake, The Time Machine is a classic film and I hope one day my son will enjoy it as much as I did. Have to watch them Morlocks though!",1229040000,,747,4.158620689655172

I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors.  The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption.  I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day.  My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life.  I consider this a much better movie than its ""twin"" Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal.  It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own.

1382396,5,B00004Z4U9,"""The Time Machine"" is as far as I'm concerned George Pal's best movie.  Released in 1960, it stars Rod Taylor as the time traveler `George'.

George is an inventor in 1899.  In an gathering of his friends, he demonstrates a scale model of what he says is a time machine.  Except for his friend Filby  (played by a finely nuanced Alan Young) those gathered don't believe him.

Unsuspected by all but Filby, George has built a full-scale model.  After his guests leave, he's off.......

The set design is brilliant.  The time machine itself is the coolest thing made by genuine imitation Hollywood Victorian  craftsman.  A nice touch is the nameplate on the control panel.  It says, ""Built by H. George Wells"".

The special effects were state-of-the-art for 1960 winning an Academy Award for best special effects.  Even today, the effects fit neatly into the story.

This is a mid-twentieth century cinematic interpretation of a nineteenth century novel.  The David Duncan screenplay `updates' the story brilliantly. While George Pal's films have a well-deserved reputation for technical excellence, the acting has been uneven.  That is not the case in this movie.

1382453,4,B00004Z4U9,"""H. G. Wells' The Time Machine"" is another of the great George Pal movies which did so much to bring science fiction to the big screen.  Naturally, the movie is based on H. G. Well's book ""The Time Machine"", which was first published in 1895.  However, there is a significant change between the movie and the book.  In the book, Wells focused on a class struggle which ultimately resulted in the separation between the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The movie, though, is about war.  The main character George (a.k.a. H. G. Wells) stops at three places in time, each of them being a major conflict; World War I, World War II, and the last a nuclear war which George Pal places in the year 1966, just six years after the movie.

The movie debuted in Japan on June 10th of 1960, before moving on to the U.S. on August 17th of the same year.  The movie stars Rod Taylor as George, with Alan Young playing David Filby and James Filby (father and son), Yvette Mimieux as Weena, and Sebastian Cabot as Dr. Hillyer.  This movie, along with ""Destination Moon"", ""When Worlds Collide"", and ""War of the Worlds"" are classics produced by George Pal, which defined science fiction in the movies.  After ""The Time Machine"", Pal turned his talents to fantasy, producing films like ""Atlantis, the Lost Continent"", ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"", and the wonderful and bizarre ""7 Faces of Dr. Lao"".",1156377600,,1386,4.647540983606557

1382481,3,B00004Z4U9,"This movie collects many of the ideas and fears of its own time, and straps them together with pieces of Wells's original story. There are some nice spots here, esp. Pal's signature stop animation in some of the time travel sequences, but not enough to save this from being only ordinary.

The 1950s-isms stand out quite clearly. The Eloi are Wells's gentle hedonists, playing ineffectually in a garden world. Here, they're all young, dressed in pastel tunics, coiffed, and blond - as if only blonds could be beautiful people. Complete lack of children in this world leaves me wondering where the next generation would come from, but issues of reproduction don't suit this movie's era. Wells's troglodytic Morlocks become monster-movie standards: green, clumsy, with glowing eyes. And, to satisfy the moral needs of the time, characters identified as good defeat the ones identified as evil, without much though to where the good guys' next meal might come from.

This movie was made in the 1950s, so the threat of nuclear war has to figure somewhere in the story. Missile silos come to mind when we see the air shafts into the Morlock's underground city. The big presence, though, is the air raid sirens, co-opted as triggers for a bizarre but recognizable instinct.

This is a fair bit of nostalgic entertainment. It loses all the social imact of Wells's story, and adds features that don't really add much. Despite that, it's still a fair popcorn movie.

Great stuff (which is why it's a great book). Why must Hollywood, both in 1960 and 2005 (or whenever that other tripe was made) simplify and elimininate this crucial point!

1382485,5,B00004Z4U9,"Though the film has flaws, mostly on the corny side, I think it is safe to say that this is the best adaptation of one of H.G. Wells' novels to film yet produced.

Wells imaginatively projected the ""class struggle"" pondered by Marx (of the capitalist owners vs. workers without a share in the means of production) 800,000 years into the future.  In this way, combining with Darwinian evolution, it becomes a struggle between two sub-species: the underground machine-lord cannibal ""Morlocks"" vs. the above ground, sunshine-loving ""Eloi,"" who the Morlocks simply breed as cattle.  In Wells' fancy, the differences between classes will become so extreme (assuming the absence of an earlier, political solution), there will eventually be an ironic ambiguity as to which class is really which.

To its merit, this is evident enough in the film; but the film adds to that a couple of dated (inaccurate) predictions concerning the ""near"" future (now past).  The result is a risky and somewhat corny ride.  Yet this addition is also fairly well off-set by the fact that the time traveler is allowed to start his journey from the late 19th century (and so from Wells' own time, as in the novel). The film here has a vivid, added dimension of the curiosity of a time machine starting its career before high tech--evidently by the sheer genius of a lone inventor. (This device was used by subsequent time travel films--as well as by other Wells-to-film attempts, like The First Men in the Moon, but never as effectively.) In the end, the film successfully portrays a maverick and human hero (the time traveler, who is never quite at home in and so rises above any period of time)--one who the audience is at least allowed to hope for--without in any way compromising the scope of Wells' intent.

Perhaps it is even some return trip of the time traveler to those ""horse and buggy"" days which changes the inaccurate ""predictions"" to recent history as we actually know it--a possibility plainly allowed for (though not shouted out) by the screenplay. A question for familiar viewers--would Filby really just let his son Jamie die and his store be destroyed, for apparently no good reason--after having received due warning?

The time-lapse animation for the time travel scenes are put to very good use, though it would have been helped by the addition of more time lapse photography (a memorable bit with a mannequin was pretty flawless, as was a decomposing Morlock), especially for a more thorough treatment of the daily sun (some aspects of which are good, yet others conspicuously inadequate). The visual appearance of the machine in the film, extrapolated from Wells' descriptions, is a remarkable feat of imagination and ingenuity, and is the envy of every true sci-fi buff.  A scene where the time traveler takes a moment to gaze upon and walk about his creation before embarking on his first journey, looking on it with admiration, amazement and anticipation (as if the machine itself were a discovery more than an invention, seamlessly pregnant with the endless adventures it promises), is even breathtaking.

The Hollywood swashbuckling and boy-meets-girl aspects are present but not overblown. The wonder of time meets technology is intelligently dealt with, as is the wonder of a man who steps out of his own time. In this respect it is very fun to watch the time traveler try to kindle the spark of curiosity and wonder in the spiritually deadened descendants of the future, who are plainly depicted as having their forerunners stemming back as far as the late 1800's (the time traveler having had similar trouble at that time as well, trying to wake up closed-minded friends and acquaintances as he argues with them about the value of time-travel). The near-futility of his struggle is very forceful, vivid and effective.

The casting is flawless and the acting is excellent, especially for the two main characters, the unnamed by Wells, ""Time Traveler"" (though very subtly given the cameo name in the film of H. George Wells--the first initial H. followed by ""George Wells"" only briefly appearing in shots of the time machine's control panel, where the inventor stylistically engraved it--though his friends do call him George) and his tiny, delicate and fun-loving girlfriend from the future, Weena.

Incidentally, the 2002 Dreamworks remake is good, but really has nothing to do with Wells' novel.  One nice twist is the albino and articulate Morlock.  There is still class stratification but it seems entirely on the side of the Morlock; the Eloi are not so much herded as hunted.  The Eloi in fact are portrayed as self sufficient--even introspective, savvy and resourceful--which really doesn't fit with Wells' novel.  Weena is still pretty, but is simply another character; even her name gets changed to ""Mara.""  The time machine itself is also good (very good), though it is impossible to believe it was constructed in 1899. (How was the thing even supposed to be powered--fusion?--external combustion might come to mind, but it seems more like it would need a helicopter motor just to propel its blades of spinning lenses; and are those beams of light supposed to be lasers?)  Not so for the 1960 film; I believe it every time--""If someone had made a time machine in 1899 that somehow actually worked, that is what it would have looked like.""  Overall, in terms of sets and direction in the ""remake,"" the distant future does not appear as distant and exotic as in the earlier film. Distorted beyond recognition in the 2002 remake is the foreboding, silent future image of the Sphinx, towering over the time traveler when he first arrives in the year 802,701.  This image from the novel is present in 1960 film, and is intended to invoke the tantalizing theme of ""the riddle of the Sphinx""--what is the difference between man and beast?  Yet in this remake there are few mysteries.  Overall, the film has the same failings, while at the same time being ""maverick"" gets reduced to the mundane, like wearing a hat not yet in style. Notably absent is the nearly-futile and perennial struggle of the hero.

Does the 1960 version solve the riddle of the Sphinx?  I think it hints at a solution: at the end of the movie, the housekeeper, Mrs. Watchett (evidently a widow, but not evidently without children), befriending Filby, evidently wishes to keep the house light going in at least in one window (in case of the Time Traveler's return)--as such she also evidently represents the future Eloi; the scene is shot just as we must imagine that Weena is also awaiting the Time Traveler's return.  It is his businessmen friends who become the Morlock--though Filby is the ambiguous go between.",1141603200,,6693,4.94385026737968

Selecting as his hero, the handsome, gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous, but moody, Victorian as a gentleman, who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in. Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and her people. During their brief time together, Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic paradise, it is not without dangers. In this future, it's the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells' time machine. Doomed to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends.

1382511,5,B00004Z4U9,"""The Time Machine"", is one of the many movies that when it was made was in danger of not living up to the expectations of many.  There were those who love H.G. Wells and wanted an acurate portrayal of his work.  There were those who liked science fiction and fantasy movies and wanted it to fit into that segment of cinema.  It was going to be difficult to please everyone, but amazingly it did.

The idea of using time travel in movies has been done and redone; I think of the movies ""Back to the Future"", ""Peggy Sue got Married"", and many many more, but for me this is one of the better done ones, because

1st.  The movie talks about searching for a greater good.  It's not just a story of humor, or vaneness, or someone trying to get out of trouble.  In other words, there is much more at stake in this movie.  It's a movie about one man searching for answers that are bigger than himself.  I can totally relate to this.  Let me be honest and say this is a thinking mans movie.  Yes, you can just simply watch and enjoy, but if that is all you do you have missed out on so much.  We are meant to watch this movie, and then meditate on it.  To see ourselves in the characters.

2nd.  the director could have made this movie in a number of ways, but the direction is superb, and I loved the special effects.  The scenes when the inventor is still in his lab watching the first half of the 20th century go by is great!

I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette on the movie that is presented by Rod Taylor.  The part of what happened to the actual machine after the movie is both interesting and sad.

1382512,5,B00004Z4U9,"George Pal directed this classic from 1960, starring Rod Taylor as the scientist who travels back through time (George, although we are meant to understand that this is a character-cipher for H.G. Wells), and Yvette Mimieux in a very early role (interestingly, she became an anthropologist, the study of which has a concern in the overall plot development and socio-political points Wells was trying to drive home with his novel).

The plot follows Wells' late Victorian novel fairly well.  Scientist George invents a time machine, and after making the proclamation to several of his nay-saying friends, including a test with a miniature time machine, takes off on a few journeys.  The early journeys are just to test, and we see a few fascinating effects here.  But the greater story lies in George's hope for the future, so he sets himself to go nearly a million years in to the future - the year 802701.

Trivia buffs will recognise the date on the machine as October 12, the same date Columbus discovered the new world.  George embarks into this new world, finding the human race has evolved into a split species - the above-ground Eloi, and the below-ground Morlochs.  The Eloi are carefree airheads for the most part - that is, until the Morlochs threaten, and then they become the hunted.  The Morlochs are presented as base creatures, following only their appetites, and afraid to remain above for too long.

The effects of the time machine itself and the transition scenes are quite good for the time - I recall as a child watching this film on television and being mesmerised by the passage of time, the scenery changes through George's window as the time streamed by, and the contrast between the Victorian household set and the future world.

The more recent remake did homage to this classic film by incorporating a few of the same ideas - the scene changes through the windows, for example.  Also, Alan Young (who played Filby in the 1960 film) appeared in the more recent film, the only actor to appear in both.

George has a tough decision to make - his time machine is stolen by the Morlochs; does he risk his life to get it back?  And does he opt to stay in the future or go back to his own time if he recovers it?

Interesting stuff.  After taking his time going into the future, first stop in the 40's, second the 60's  and then .... on to 802701.  Civilization is in ancient ruins .... technology seems to have expired.  Here are the Eloi, a group of futuristic nymphs and idiots dressed in skimpy pastel togas singing and staring and giggling like cretins.  Life is simple...as George the Time Traveler learns when one of the pretty little nymphettes starts to drown in the river and no one rushes to her aid.  Enter hero George... he soon discovers that there's something sinister in this braindead paradise...enter the Morlocks.  The Morlocks are a group of critters that used to be human thousands and thousands of years ago but were transformed when they fled the surface of the planet (probably because of the implied nuclear halocaust) to dwell in the darkness.  Glowing eyes, blue-green skin, blond fur running down the top of both arms...these creeps mean business.  A siren starts to wail and the Eloi start marching like mesmerized lemmings to a cliff...into the underground.  For...here's the kicker...the Eloi are the Morlock's food supply.  Can you say cannibalism?  I knew you could.  Overall, this 1960 classic can't be denied its rightful place in film history.  Looking back the effects pale in the light of CGI, but they were more pure back then, more real, and people like George Pal paved the way for the things possible today.  This is a great movie!  Be not afraid...far, far superior to the remake.

The charactors - Alan Young's Mr. Philby stands out - add flesh to the Victorian era story of an inventor who could easily destroy the world, but winds up (possibly) saving mankind from itself.

Second... while i was reading some reviews (mostly the bad ones) the one that bothered me was that of 'davidfancella,' when says that the relationship between Weena and time traveler is man and pet, that was not how i viewed it in the novel, i did feel a romantic connection and i don't think i was the only one and everyone is entitled to their opinion and their interpretation and i did get a romantic feeling between them in the book.

Yes in the book the Eloi were short and i was kind of disapointed that they were of average height here but that is my only complain.

The ending was changed and i like this hollywood ending better only because in the book it left me wondering what happened to the time traveler and i wanted to know and this movie tells you what happened, but if you are the type that likes when writers leaves the ending up to the readers imagination then read the book, read the book anyways because i did enjoy it!

I think the movie looked and sounded great, even if the evil creatures did look totally fake even if some things from the book were changed and left out. I think it was a great story, and a great cast and the roles were played out perfectly. Like i said, different yet from all the versions i've seen, this is the one closer to the book of the time traveler disapointed with the present who thought that the future was his answer and that humanity would progress only to be disapointed again when he sees how lazy and dumb society becomes.

1382540,5,B00004Z4U9,"This film was made before CG, before Star Wars and Star Trek and all those other sci-fi films that seem to be wholly about lasers and do-dads and weird looking aliens.  See, I never liked science fiction.  I found it to be too nerdy, lacking heart and soul, more concerned with gadgetry and amazingly complicated story lines and stuff I just couldn't relate to.  What I didn't realize is that there is sci-fi for me: the classics.  This was when the emphasis was on the fiction, this was when sci-fi could serve as an allegory to man's plight in the universe, peeling back the layers of what makes us human while carefully masking it's message behind some entertainment.  The time machine is one of these films.  I first saw it in sixth grade, many years ago and remembered being surprised about liking it (again, don't like sci-fi).  But this film has some great characters, performances, something to say without saying it, and some great old effects (again, cg takes me right out of a film, it's just more inventive here if a bit cheesy).  THe picture looks great so I'd definately recommend buying it.

But the real reason to buy it is the behind the scenes featurette. It is simply hillarious.  I have never laughed so hard at a featurette.  The pacing is what got to me, the singular fixation on the prop of the time machine rather than an in-depth explanation of the film, the creepy way Rod Taylor looks up to talk to the deceased George Pal, when one of the actors just stares into the camera talking to the audience in character with a slow zoom into his face, the ""what-if"" scene at the end, the random inclusion of material and the shoving in of the title card every once and awhile.  It's like listening to your grandfather tell you a story about his favorite chair.  It's comic genius (not to be disrespectful to any involved but all seemed highly staged and organized so I feel that I'm not insulting them when I say that)

Favorite line: Rod Taylor: ""And so the time machine lives on, in Back to the Future promos and other various appearences""

The special bonus features are also equally excellent with a few of the original stars of the film appearing some 30 years later with some neat surprises about the film.

1382542,5,B00004Z4U9,"THE TIME MACHINE tells the story of (Rod Taylor), an enterprising Victorian scientist who develops a way-back machine that crushes four dimensions into three, so that human beings can be transported through time as well as through space.  The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed, and Rod Taylor, the Australian he-man star, does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around.  His first moments inside the machine are thrilling, as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him, then light again, then dark, then whole months pass within instants, and then whole years.  When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races, the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid, the other brainiac weaklings.  Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production, and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen, while the Eloi were us, castrated professors educated out of our balls.  Rod Taylor's mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, exquisitely elfin and needy, in her leaf-colored linen dress, falling for George (HG Wells, Rod Taylor's character) despite her natural antipathy towards dark men.

This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet, oddly enough, it is perfect for young children.  Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time.  Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy, all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks, pitied the Eloi, and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world.  Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1,000,000 years from now where Weena waits for him?

It's a treat on DVD, as are the special features and commentary, but Alan Young doesn't seem to have a bit of shame in him; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie.",1118966400,,2231,4.680306905370844
1382543,5,B00004Z4U9,"I wonder how many minds were blown back in the day when George Pal's The Time Machine (1960) was released?  I'm not so much speaking of the special effects (which were, and still are amazing), but more so the concepts presented within the film, with regards to traveling in the fourth dimension i.e. moving back and forth through time all while occupying the same space throughout...I know, I know, the ideas had been around for some time as author H.G. Wells had created the work the film was based on way back around the turn of the 20th century, but surely the film reached a large audience, quite a few probably never having read his novel.  Produced and directed by George Pal (When Worlds Collide, The War of the Worlds), a pioneer in fantasy and sci-fi cinema, the film stars Rod Taylor (World Without End, The Birds), in what is probably his best-known role as George, a scientist with a hankering to break on through to the other side.  Also appearing is Alan Young, whom many may recognize as the voice for Disney's Scrooge McDuck (he also was the only actor from the original film to appear in the recent 2002 remake starring Guy Pearce), Yvette Mimieux (Where the Boys Are, The Black Hole), Tom Helmore (Vertigo), Whit Bissell (Airport, Soylent Green), and Sebastian Cabot (Kismet), whom many may remember as the rotund Mr. French from the late 60's television show `Family Affair'.

The story begins in Victorian England with the arrival of a group of distinguished looking gentlemen to the home of their colleague George, played Rod Taylor.  Thing is, George invited them for dinner, but has yet to appear himself, that is until he busts through the door, disheveled and unkempt, with what may be the most fantastic tale any one has ever heard, which takes us back five days prior as George, who's an inventor by the way, is having the same group over to reveal his latest invention, a machine that would allow for one to travel backwards and forwards through time.  It's all theoretical as the device has yet to be tested, and George is met with skepticism by all except for one, his friend Filby (Young).  Anyway, after the guests leave, George decides it's time to put his machine to the test, and what do you know?  It Works!  One should know the impetus for George's desire to travel forward in time is based on his dissatisfaction with the current state of human development, specifically out penchant for fighting with each other, and he desires to see a world without conflict, among other things.  As he goes forward he stops a few times but that which he wishes to avoid continually presents itself, eventually driving him into the year 800,000 where the world has become an Eden-like paradise populated by people called the Eloi.  There is no need to work, no laws, no gooberment, just a carefree lifestyle...with a hideous underbelly in the form of a group called the Morlocks, grotesque underground dwellers who are, well, what they are and share a chilling relationship with the Eloi...

I found this film to be great fun, and one of the best science fictions films I've seen in a long time.  As far as its faithfulness to the source material, I couldn't really tell you, but I did get the feel that there was a lot of respect involved towards Wells' vision, especially given the film focused a great deal on the moral aspects and implications of who we are and how they may affect future generations.  This, along with superior special effects (which earned the film an Academy Award for 1960) really helped sell the film overall.  Some of the effects may seem quaint by today's standards, but back in the day this had to have been cutting edge stuff.  The passage of time indicated by all the meticulous stop motion work, among other things, looks amazing.  I also really liked the whole `Victorian' feel of the time machine itself, a sense that it was truly created within the time period specified.  I thought Taylor did very well presenting a man driven by his desire to find the best in humanity, only to discover the more things change, the more they tend to stay the same.  It felt like there was real growth from within the character, growth that stemmed from experiencing so much in so little time.  I especially liked the character of Alan Young as Filby as to me he represented sort of the general populous of society, those who live their lives day to day, living within their world, content to make things better through small steps than great strides.  I can't remember the specific dialog, but there was a scene that illustrated this well in where Filby tries to convince George to destroy his machine and makes a remark with regards to how we have to live within our time and make the best of it that we can...

Warner Brothers provides an excellent wide screen (1.66:1) transfer on this DVD.  The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the picture quality nearly flawless.  The audio, available in both English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0), comes through clean and clear.  There are some special features, including a theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios.  Also included is a 47 minute documentary that looks like it was made for television broadcast as there's obvious stopping points for the inclusion of commercials.  The piece, titled The Time Machine: The Journey Back, is hosted by the star of the original film Rod Taylor (looking much older), and offers a lot of details about the film, but the main focus seems to be on the machine itself, how it was developed, created, and its long and curious history after production on the original film ceased.  This takes up most of the 47 minute running time, with what is left used to create a sort of reunion tale as some of the original actors resume their character roles for a short bit.  I found this extra to be really interesting, and it helped me to appreciate the film even more, but I did feel it got a little schmaltzy (even creepy) at times, especially when Taylor would look up in the air and speak like he was talking to producer and director George Pal, who passed away in 1980, and I think this featurette was shot in 1993.

1382544,5,B00004Z4U9,"When I first saw this movie I was only 8. I saw it on TV and -due to the TV set-in B & W not it color. However it had a great impact on me because of the incredible and magical special effects. For a small boy years away from the computers enviroment this was the very best movie of all...and it still is.

I wonder why George Pal never become such a great entrepreneur as Walt Disney. Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures.

And in speaking of pictures, Pal and Disney established their own landmarks, from my point of view, with ""The Time Machine"" and ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"" respectively.

""The Time Machine"" may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking: it makes you believe for a moment it's possible to travel through time.",1112572800,,914,4.396449704142012
1382545,5,B00004Z4U9,"Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood: bubblegum trading cards, comic books, and George Pal movies. The early sixties was a great time to be a kid. With other classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth to entertain our eager young minds, our eyes frequently popped at the terrific adventures we witnessed onscreen. The Time Machine endures as great cinematic storytelling.

When I was little, the movie scared me. Remember, the atomic attack comes in 1966, which was still the future for us then. My favorite part has always been when George fast-forwards in his lab. However, that gave me some anxiety at the time because it disturbed me that he was leaving home and maybe never coming back. I thought the Morlocks were great monsters and seem to recall my friends and I dividing up between Morlocks and Eloi for some play fighting later. Of course it was more fun to be a Morlock than an Eloi. But if you got to be Rod Taylor, then you had ARRIVED.

One of the interesting things I noted on my last viewing was the technology. 80.000 years into the future, what remains of knowledge is stored on old ""rings"" that spin to speak. I turned and looked at my ten-year-old son and said, ""That could be cds!""

Round, shiny discs that play an audio recording when spinning-sounds just like a cd to me. Even in 1960, this was amazingly prophetic. Also, I mentioned how great it would be to have a replica of the time machine. Then, ""our host"", Robert Osbourne remarked as to how the prop had become lost and then years later bought at a THRIFT STORE! Just imagine that lucky son-of-a-gun.

It's a shame that we've grown to a time when special effects take precedent over character and story. Fortunately, an occassional film comes forward with both (like LOTR) but the newer Time Machine is not one of these. Rod Taylor and George Pal's version is the one to see. Made in the midst of the Cold War, it's a question of where are we going as a species: annihilation or ascension. Ultimately, it is an optimistic piece about the noble possibilities that endure despite neverending conflicts inherent in the human experience.

1382570,5,B00004Z4U9,"Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux star in George Pal's ""The Time Machine"", a great sci fi movie based on the novel by H.G. Wells.
Taylor plays George an inventor in the late 18th century (1899 to be exact) who makes a machine that can go back in time.
At first his colleagues are skeptical, but when they see George's small model machine that goes back in time, they start to believe him.
George's best friend, and supporter is David played by Alan Young.
George takes the machine back, because he is sick of the present time, with war being brought on.
He travels to the early and middle 1900's and to his shock , George finds out that Man's future lies in war (which is pretty accurate even up to today's time).
He sees how WWI and WWII started, and even sees when his house is destroyed by an enemy plane!
George then travels far into the future, the year 802701, to see if mankind has any hope of living in peace.
At first, he sees a great paradise with many people (mostly children) play about in solitude. But when one lady named Weena, starts to drown, he sees that no one seems to care. He rescues her, and after talking to the other youths, he learns that they learned nothing from their ancient ancestors.
The books they have are old and buried.
They have lived the good the life, based on the sacrifices from mankind, and they don't appreciate it (which is another accurate telling of today's times).
He learns that Weena is part of the Eloi society which is under the slavery of the Morlocks, a cannibalistic race.
The Morlocks give everything, food and clothing to the Eloi , in exchange for the slavery and their bodies as food.
The movie was directed by sci fi whiz George Pal who won an impressive 7 oscars and awards for his movies.
He is the Steven Spielberg when it comes to sci fi movies.
What's astonishing about the film is the special effects that were made without computer help (which in most movies make the movie look more fake than real).
The way the special effects people made flowers bloom, candles burn while the Time Machine went in time, is very special to see.
It's a great site, from a special effects view, how these people managed to do these effects, with the limited resources they had.
He directed ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Destination Moon"" which won numerous awards. DVD comes with a number of great features:
A behind the scenes documentary with Rod Taylor. A great documentary where he shows how George Pal designed the machine. Taylor even shows us storyboards which haven't been seen in 30 yrs.

1382571,5,B00004Z4U9,"There are a lot of reviews about this great picture and how it influenced an entire generation. All of it is true! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder. We can thank Mr. Wells for creating the story, but we really owe it to George Pal, Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure. The real draw of course is ""The Time Machine"" prop. Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired. The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved. All of the elements of Victorian London in winter, cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner, ""tea table"" chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting. When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor. As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you cannot help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a ""cold war"" interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the ""future"" on August 18th, 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust. From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture. The care that went into this DVD should not be understated. It is a highly polished film that restores 20/20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there. Once again, we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in, the clear sky above the Eloi ""cafeteria"" and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns. When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that ""that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time"" and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs. Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again, because you are in love with a romantic idea, TIME TRAVEL.",1088726400,,2497,4.5388026607538805

1382573,4,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine had a great effect on me. I found it to be enjoyable and it had very fascinating theories throughout. What I liked most in the book was the interesting characters, H.G. Wells' style of writing, the parallel of Eloi and Morlocks to society now, how the book always kept my attention, and finally I liked how the narrator left us questioning the conclusion of the novel.
  First, I liked how interesting the characters were simply because that is a vital aspect to a good novel. I was impressed by the Time Traveller, and how he was determined to prove his machine to be a success. The characters whom attended his dinners always seemed a little skeptical of his ideas and theories. The Time Traveller explains his discovery of the fourth-dimension and the Psychologist interrupts stating,""You can move about in all directions of space, but you cannot move about in Time"" (III.13.16).
  The second thing I liked about the novel was the authors' style of writing. Wells remained descriptive throughout the book. For a novel based on imagination and theories, I found it important that Wells had kept some reality in it. (Reality being the descriptive details in the novel.) With all these crazy ideas going on in the book, Wells had to keep our minds somewhat intact to what his visions were. The Time Traveller describes the Eloi's as being ""very beautiful and graceful creatures, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive-that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much""(III.34.33.)
  Another aspect of the novel I enjoyed, was the parallel of the Eloi and Morlocks to society now. We begin to understand that the Eloi and Morlocks are humans after great evolution and time. It amazed me to see how society completely divided itself between graceful creatures and creatures of the underworld.
  The fourth thing I liked was how the book kept my attention the whole way through. I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next or how the Time Traveller was going to escape the Morlocks and get back to his machine.
  Finally, I really enjoyed how the narrator concludes the Time Travellers disappearance. The narrator says,""The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned""(XII.124.18). I liked this because it made you question whether the Time Traveller had vanished into the future forever, whether he had always been from a past time and had gone back, or what was to come of him? So, as it began with one mans' imagination, it ends with your own.",1085011200,,2581,4.845454545454546
1382574,5,B00004Z4U9,"Director George Pal will probably be more remembered for this film than any of his other classics, including ""Giant.""  Why?  Remember, this is 1960, and whether or not Pal's version is true to Wells' book is not the issue.  Marvel at the unique special effects, including the mannequin's many transformations, the way the clouds scurry across the window; the lush but sterile world of the eloi and morlocks.  This is quite groundbreaking in the world of cinema, long before the CGI and animatronics guys came along.  Rod Taylor (The Birds, TV's Falcon Crest) is the perfect studly hero, but he also possesses a sensitivity uncommon in movies of the 60s, which is all more evident in his friendship with the delightful Alan Young (Tom Thumb, Mr. Ed).  Add a trio of our most respected character actors (Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore) to lend upper crust credence.  And how can one forget the lovely Yvette Mimieux.  Yvette came to audiences attentions in a two part Dr. Kildare episode. She played his love interest, a surfer with elilepsy, who dies in the final moments.  She also played the troubled young girl in ""Where the Boys Are"" and in the 1970s starred in a rarely known cult classic, ""Hit Lady.""  Her beautiful innocence is captured in this movie.
Yes, it's campy, a little corny in its naivete about man's future, but as a scifi film, it's one of the best and far surpasses its glitzy remake with Guy Pearce.",1084665600,,1434,4.745967741935484
1382575,5,B00004Z4U9,"I cannot say how faithful this movie is to the book, however it is an outstanding science fiction movie.  The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today, but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay.  Rod Taylor's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note.  The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done.  It is a classic story well adapted to the screen.  I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans.",1082678400,,560,4.852631578947369
1382576,3,B00004Z4U9,"A lot of people don't know this is a book that was published in 1895, well before nuclear weapons had even been conceived.
I give it three stars because as told, it's a decent movie.  Of course, you have to forget that it was made in the 60s, otherwise you'd expect better special effects.  In any case, it's a decent movie with a few minor caveats.
First, in the book, there is no nuclear war.  The Time Traveler doesn't have a name, and his *first* stop is with the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The Eloi are small, like children, and so are the Morlocks.  His relationship with Weena is one of a man and his pet, not a romantic relationship at all.  He speculates that as society is progressing in the 1890s, it would evolve into this Master-Slave relationship between the Morlocks and the Eloi.
In the movie, this whole theme is completely warped to suit the movie-makers own political agenda, making a statement about nuclear war.  I'm not saying making a statement about nuclear war is bad or anything, but they completely warped a book that was a commentary on 1890 English society in order to fill their own agenda.  This is not acceptable behavior.
Second, in the book, the Time Traveler goes much farther forward in time than just the Eloi and the Morlocks.  In the movies, that's always his destination, but in the book it was his first stop.  He explored mankind's future all the way until earth couldn't support life anymore and the moon had finally spun out of orbit, the sun wasn't shining so brightly anymore, and so forth.  There is a great deal of excellent philosophizing on the basic question of ""What the hell are we supposed to be doing?""
In the movie, nothing.
Finally, in the book he returns to prove his adventures to his colleagues, and they don't believe him.  So he takes off and never returns.  Philby (although I don't recall if the author was named that) is the one who tells the story.
The movie does take advantage of this aspect of the book, and does it much better than the one Dreamscape made.  They did add some to it and embellish it, and ask a very interesting question about which three books you would take to rebuild society.  The reason this is a caveat is because 99% of the substance of the book is drained at this point.  Only a few plot points are kept, and it is actually an extremely poor interpretation of the book.
It's another case of ""Hollywood screwed up another book.""  I'd recommend watching it, knock yourself out.  I grew up on this movie.  But READ THE BOOK.  If this movie affects you in any way, the book will knock you over.  HG Wells was brilliant, hollywood is not.",1080518400,,2623,4.491561181434599
1382597,5,B00004Z4U9,"You know something, the Eloi remind me of myself.
They are disorientated, not knowing what the hell is going on, and just going places they just don't wanna go, but go, because they don't know that they don't want to go to that place they are going to!!! Read it again, it'll make sense.
This movie is the best of the best when it comes to time travel flicks. George Pal couldn't have done a better book to film transfer. Music is eerie and Roddy taylor is perfect as the time traveller and is believable as a 19th century inventor.

1382598,4,B00004Z4U9,"An anti-war theme is prominent throughout this classic sci-fi flick.  In the lead you have Rod Taylor starring as inventor H.G. Wells, a man seeking relief from, and improvement of, the world in which he lives.  Demonstrating a miniature version of his time machine for a trio of friends (including Sebastian Cabot of ""Family Affair"" fame) on New Year's Eve 1899, he laments that he was born in the wrong time...and that he would like to journey into the future to live among more civilized peoples.  He desires the utopia that he thinks technology will inevitably bring, but also cries out at the corruption of technology for other than peaceful purposes.
His journey, however, leaves him feeling overwhelmed as it is far from what he expects.  He initially watches the years go by from his machine as represented by a manequin he observes in a shop window across the street.  There, he views what he regards as a harbinger of societal descent into a more liberal way of life.  As fashions change dramatically over the decades, he blushingly remarks, ""You call that a dress?"".  He makes three intermediate stops on his way to his ultimate destination--the first in 1917, the second in 1940, and the third in 1964.  They all, conveniently, coincide with raging wars (the final one, a ficticious World War III fought with nuclear weapons that lasts for 326 years).
Embittered and frightened, he moves on, ultimately coming to a stop some 800,000 years in the future.  Wells is initially delighted with his new-found utopia and attempts to befriend the native Eloi, a blond-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned Aryan race of humans.  He is quickly repulsed as he sees them passively watch as one of their own (Weena, played by the lovely Yvette Mimieux) starts to drown only a few feet from the others.  After saving her, he learns that they are nothing more than a race of slow-witted, cowardly do-nothings who rely on the sinister Morlocks for survival.
The Morlocks, who look like a cross between the Hulk and the gill man on ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" were the humans who chose to continue living underground after the end of the last war.  They deevolved physically and morally and, as a result, developed into ravenous cannibals who fattened up the Eloi so as to devour them at a later date (eating the oldest ones first).
There is no written word within either culture and that lends itself to the theory that cultures tend to stagnate without the written word.  Without books there is no learning beyond pure observation and word of mouth and, in this case, both races eventually lost whatever skills and knowledge they once possessed.
Eventually, the Eloi and Morlocks took on a primitive symbiotic relationship.  You have the peace-loving, vegetarian, let-nature-take-its-course Eloi one one side, and the militaristic (they still use air raid sirens to hypnotize the Eloi), meat-eating (of a sort), control-your-own-destiny Morlocks.  Despite his appreciation for much of the Eloi philosophy--he initially mistakes them for economic genuises--he quickly realizes the truth about them and grows disgusted with their apathetic attitude towards self-improvement and advancement.

Ironically, circumstances dictate him teaching the Eloi the value of fighting (back), a trait he abhorred.  As a result, the Eloi defeat the Morlock in a demonstration that while war may be bad it can also be the LESSER of two evils.  Still, after their victory, the Eloi are left to answer the question ""How do we fend for ourselves now?"".  Wells chooses to stay among them, returning to his time only long enough to retrieve three books to help them in their journey.  In the final scene of the movie, one of the inventor's friends discusses Well's future with Well's housekeeper.  He finally asks her (and the audience), ""Which three books would you have chosen?"".
The film confronts the positives and negatives of pacifism vs. militarism and, in an overall generic sense, liberalism vs. conservatism, all with regard to the survival and growth of a society.  Eventually, the movie shows that raging examples of either philosophy isn't the solution--that the true solution resides closer to the middle of the spectrum (with the pendulum tilting into conservative territory.
The story is timeless, the script and acting good, and George Pal's special effects excellent considering the age of the movie.  The movie's depth is often overlooked, and it is a worthy addition to any DVD library.",1067472000,,4484,5.05427408412483

1382600,5,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is one of the best science fiction films made and it has always been one of my favorites! The first time I watched this was when I was in the first grade. The movie is about an inventor named George[Rod Taylor] who has greated a time machine and goes on a journey into the year 802701.
  The movie starts out when you see David Filby[one of George's friends] walking up to George's house where you see some more of his friends. Then eventually you see George but he's been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey. Then he talks about the story.
  In the next part, George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want's to proove that time travel really exists. But, when his friends don't believe him he decides to go on the long journey.
  Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701. Instead of having a lot of technology it's just an area of grass. There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks. The morlocks give the Eloi their food, clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them. So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her. But, soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi don't work very much and they mostly just play, so he goes back to his machine. But, thats when the trouble begins. The morlocks have stolen his machine! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place. So, the only thing left to do is go to the underground area, kill the morlocks, save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time.
  When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion.
  In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again.

I loved the Morlock cannibals and they are just as scary now as they were all those years ago.  The new people of earth could be seen as some of today's generation...in a daze and dependent on big brother to tell them what to do.  I don't know if that was part of the original book or George Pals interpretation of it.
All in all if you are looking for a good fantasy adventure, look no further...If you saw this as a child it loses none of it's impact.  I wonder what the director George Pal would say if he knew how this movie still stands the test of time and is very important in cinema history.
There is also a short sequel of sorts in the DVD.  It was filmed several years later.  The characters still come to life after all these years.  I wish that George Pal made a sequel way back then.

1382603,4,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is an excellent science fiction movie about time travel that was one of the first to use special effects in great detail.  An inventor, played by Rod Taylor, builds a time machine and begins to travel through time.  He sees both WWI and WWII as well as 1968 during the Cold War in which he experiences a nuclear attack.  The movie really picks up when he travels far into the future to a time when people are ruled by Morlocks, cannibalistic creatures who basically breed humans so they can eat them.  Seeing how horrible it is, the inventor tries to free them from the wrath of the Morlocks.
 This is a very exciting movie that has some very good commentary on our society as a whole.  Throughout the movie, the inventor sees the mindset of people as he travels through time and often how ridiculous things really are.  Rod Taylor is excellent as the inventor while Yvette Minieux is gorgeous as Weena, the young woman he befriends while trying to save the Eloi from the Morlocks.

I wasn't planning on watching it, I heard how good it was, but it never came across me. One day at the store I picked it up on dvd, I popped it in the player and wow was I amazed. This movie never slows down, it's really entertaining and makes you ponder about the the future and the posibility of time travel. Of course not through that type of device he used but just time traveling general. The scenery is stunning and the effects are pleasing. Nobody has the right to dislike this movie, the story is great, the events that happen during the film are interesting and you won't be stopping it while your watching it. Nearly everyone who put down this movie either had problems with the visual/audio or have a very short attention span and no imagination. The morlocs are one race you won't forget and the same goes for the main character and his stunning lady from the future Weena, I believe that was her name. Watching this and getting back to regular life is hard because it makes life seem so dull and boring, it leaves you curious and wanting more. That's what a film should do to someone, this is a classic and in my eyes one of the best sci-fi films ever made.

Wells' underlying messages, this movie, for me, was the finest entertainment I can remember until 2001, A Space Odyssey, which was a distant second.

1382628,5,B00004Z4U9,"George Pal was the man who brought us the science fiction classics ""When Worlds Collide"" and ""The War of the Worlds"".  George did an equally good job with ""The Time Machine"".
Herbert Wells wonders about the evolution of society and looks forward into the future at the great things man will accomplish.  The drive to see that great future has driven Herbert to create a machine to get there.  One aspect I enjoyed about this movie and ""Time after Time"" is that Herbert in each movie was interested in the progress of society and man.  Their action with the time machine was the equivalent of turning to the last chapter of a novel.
In this movie, Herbert finds that society has been destroyed by a nuclear war, which in 1960 seemed like a very real and imminent possibility.  Mankind was driven underground by the need to escape the effects of the war, leading ultimately to the evolution of the peaceful Eloi and the predatory Morlocks.  The Morlocks principal source of food seems to be the Eloi, while the Eloi eat fruits and vegetables, which inadvertently becomes a commentary on what happens to vegetarians.
George Pal tries hard and generally succeeds in exploiting what happens when a society no longer has a need to drive itself to achieve a goal, whatever that goal may be.  The Eloi have everything provided, so they see no need to strive to be any different.  Things are the way they have always been, and life if good.  If some disappear occasionally, well, we can still go play by the rocks and do whatever.  Obviously some of this story is difficult to believe because we know that even ""peaceful"" animals such as rams and bulls sometimes fight to the [end] over females and territory, and it would seem like there would be some point of contention even in this ""perfect"" society.  However, given that the movie has to present a viewpoint in a relatively small time frame, it succeeds well by the very exaggeration of the characteristics of such a society.
The end of the movie is most satisfying, as Alan Young (playing George Well's best friend Philby), speculates on three books that George took with him to help re-build the civilization of the far future.
While the movie suffers from many of the cliches and the now dated styling of the late 1950s, it creates a very believably little tale with award winning special effects.  At the end of the movie you are left with the sense that mankind has the ability to triumph over the odds.  I am admittedly partial to these classics, which did so much with so little, requiring much plot creativity.  However, when the end credits roll, you walk out satisfied that you were treated to a real movie experience.
While I should give this movie 4 stars for its weak points, it gets 5 stars for standing the tests of time and being better than the 2002 re-make.",1045267200,,2821,4.63855421686747

1382630,5,B00004Z4U9,"If you asked me what my two favorite science-fiction movies were, I'd have to say Forbidden Planet and The Time Machine. As anyone who has read the book can tell you, it's not the kind of story that really lends itself to a movie. Why? Well...
The book was about the seperation of the social classes. About the futility of human achievement, and ultimately, about how human kindness is the one thing that survives when all else is lost. In that story, one human being was just a cog in the wheel of time, and had little power to change anything.
But the movie...ah the movie was about something else entirely. Look past the excellent special effects and the (in my book anyway) great acting and flow of plot. What do you have? A story about the suffering of humanity. The striving for knowledge and improvement. And the idea that if people allow themselves to stagnate, to become complacent, and to forget the mistakes of the past, they may allow their world to turn into a nightmare rather than the Utopia they long for. In this movie, one human being CAN make a difference. The time traveler helps the people of the future to rediscover their courage, their compassion, their humanity. As long as one person still clings to the ideals of humanity, there is always hope.
This is a great movie, and the dvd certainly does it justice. It features one of the nicest film transfers I have ever seen.

Most touching is wheh Taylor goes to 1966 London in the midst of a nuclear holocaust, he stops by a park which Alan Young's son has dedicated to his father's friendship to Taylor. Pretty moving stuff, especially the poignant scene where Taylor goes nearly 20 years into the future in 1917 and learns that Young's son had told him the story of his friendship with Taylor.

Some of us though have seen the Laserdisc as well so our expectations of the DVD were a little higher. Frankly, I think Warner has given ""The Time Machine"" a better than average transfer for Warner. I also don't think that is saying much either. The aspect ratio is off, details at Amazon.com give it 1:66:1, but Widescreen review is giving it as 1:78:1, which is closer to what you see on the screen. So little is made of the widescreen field however, that a fullscreen editon would probably enhance details in the center, especially Yvette Mimieux and Rod Taylor who give wonderful performances in this film. This is probably why I enjoyed the film on television so much over the years. I found the sound passable but the dialogue too soft at times. The picture succumbed to grain a little to often, but it's certainly better than it has looked in years. The lack of any running commentary is probably what is really missing on this otherwise decent DVD edition. It would have been better still if they had issued the Pan and Scan edition on the second layer or flip side with this Widescreen editon.  Instead, we get as a supplemental a nearly decade old 45 minute TV program, much of its footage is far older, fuzzy and faded, hosted by Rod Taylor.  He had changed so much that I didn't recognise him at first. I understand this is yet another MGM title which Warners is issuing on DVD after getting the rights from Turner.

1382659,5,B00004Z4U9,"In order for a science fiction movie to seem plausible, it needs more than special effects wizardry, evil villains, or even a handsome hero (although all three do not hurt).  It needs at its core, a hero who resonates with the audience, one in whom they can identify because he acts believably, if not heroically.  In George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE, the time traveller George (Rod Taylor) can put the audience at ease with a smile or gentlemanly act of gallantry and can in a flash revert to the traditional role of derring doer whenever a pretty damsel is in need.  The recent (2002) version of this film with Guy Pearce in the title role has too much of special effects and not enough of the hero.  George Pal wisely allows his time traveller not to play second banana to the then (1960) special effects that wowed the viewer without distracting him.
  George is a scientist who on the last day of the 19th century wishes to prove to his circle of doubting friends that time travel is not only possible but practicable.  There is a charming scene in which he lectures to them on the fourth dimension, culminating with a mini-time machine model that takes a cigar to the future.  This scene functions as a necessary segue to the larger model that will carry him to his unknown future.  Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot have minor but significant roles in that they set the tone that this movie is more about the relationships between people than it is between man and novel technology. George zooms to the far future where he encounters a race of humans (the Eloi) who have degenerated morally into a blandly hedonistic group of blonde but not too adventuresome weaklings who are opposed by equally degenerate atavistic green-skinned Neanderthals who see the Eloi only as food.  This division of humanity into opposite sides of the same Jekyll and Hyde persona forces George into an ugly choice: he must decide which race is the better carrier of its ancient lineage.  This decision is not as obvious as it may seem on first glance.  The Eloi look more human but lack the moral fiber to take a stand even on issues related to their survival.  The Morlocks certainly are ugly enough to arouse repulsion, but they nevertheless possess the drive to succeed and the ability to propagate their species.  An Eloi female Weena (Yvette Mimieux) helps George to decide in favor of the Eloi.  Yet, part of the success for this movie is the subtext that though appearances of humans and even humanoids may vary through evolution, each grouping and subgrouping of species cannot be judged on a broad cloth of value.  It is to the individual member that imbues that species with its collective identity.  The Eloi, for all their lack of purpose, fighting spirit, and drive to succeed, managed to win out over their more bestial competitors--this time.  But the ending leaves the viewer that this victory of surface humanity over surface inhumanity may not be assuring enough to convince George, the Eloi themselves or the viewer that such success will continue no matter how far into the future George may go.",1029024000,,3094,4.72998137802607

I think George Pal was the Steven Spielberg of his time. It's a great masterpiece,Rod Taylor was perfect as the time travller and it was a total blast watching him go forward in time. In the remake it was a total of 10 minutes of him going though time and in the orgainal,it's about half and hour. So to the people of my generation,skip the remake and watch the Pal classic instead.

Rod Taylor was fantastic and played his character with a real sense of amazement. (If you have seen the new version  it lacks a real important element  characters anyone cares about.) This movie has a charm and romance that Yvette Mimoeux could only portray.
Even George Pals visions of what the 80 and 90s would be like are not far off. Who could forget the classic mannequin in the window sequence  watching fashion styles change before our eyes. The key to most of the special effects in the film was of course  stop motion animation. Whereby, elements and props and sets are shot one frame at a time while slight movements were made between each exposed frame. Thanks to CGI technology these days  this has almost become a lost art form. When it is done well, like in this movie  it really is effective and shines.
The DVD extras on this one are great. A television retrospective shot in the mid 90s with some of the original cast is really well done. The behind the scenes and event he history of what happened to the original Time Machine are on this documentary.

1382665,5,B00004Z4U9,"This is the ultimate in classic sci-fi. Even though the special effects pale in comparison to today's standards, I like it better than the remake.

This is the story of H.G. Wells, told as a recounting of his visit nearly a million years into the future in a time machine he has constructed. The film differs from the book in a few ways, but they are mostly because the original book was written long before the creation of the atomic bomb, and that in the 50's when the film was made, everyone was paranoid of nuclear attack.

The DVD version has some great behind the scenes and 'making of' featurettes. If you are a fan of classic sci-fi, this is a must-have.

At the end of the film, Wells goes back to the future time, and the only thing that he appears to have taken are visible as two empty spaces on his bookshelf. The question is, which two books would you take?",1022630400,,871,4.331288343558282

I sat with my jaw hanging open and goose bumps on my arms even as soon as the opening credits when I heard the surround sound kick in. My VHS copy always had a really bad audio track, but on the DVD, you can actually hear the faint electrical buzz of the machine running in the lab before he hits that crystal lever. I saw and heard things I never knew existed in this movie.  And it has a fabulous documentary with it, hosted by Rod Taylor, that explains everything we always wondered like what happened to that little model of the machine that he put the cigar in, and the full scale machine itself has a story that you won't believe! All in all, it's a wonderful movie, and everything a DVD should be. Brilliant, vibrant, with gut vibrating audio.

1382688,4,B00004Z4U9,"Skip the godawful remake that's in theaters right now, and get the original instead.  This is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, and the DVD restoration is great.
The movie itself has much to recommend it.  It follows the book very closely, Rod Taylor was an excellent choice for the lead, and the special effects (which won an Oscar in 1960) have aged surprisingly well.
It takes place in 1899, and a great deal of effort was taken to ensure historic authenticity.  The time machine itself is a beautiful Victorian contraption that wouldn't look out of place in, say, 12 Monkeys.  The Eloi of the 800k century look exactly as I would have pictured them, and the Morlocks are suitably creepy.
Much has been said for the special effects, which use some very effective stop-action photography.  They are judiciously used here, and with only a couple of tiny exceptions, do a great job of suspending disbelief.
The DVD transfer is stunning, rivaling that of North by Northwest.  The colors (originally done using Metrocolor) are deeply saturated and vivid, only looking slightly washed out in a couple of places.  Artifacts from the original print are present here and there (noticeably in the rotting fruit sequence), but for the most part have been well cleaned up.  This certainly doesn't look like a 40-year-old movie.
The DVD includes a documentary which is really interesting in parts, but really drags in others (the special effects explanations are *exhaustive*), which isn't a problem since it has its own chapter stops.  What's really informative is to watch the original movie footage in the documentary and compare it to the restored footage in the movie itself.  Night and day.  Oh yeah, and Michael J. Fox and Carl Sagan make appearances!
All in all, a classic movie that's aged well, and a brilliant transfer to match.",1019088000,,1851,4.9006410256410255
1382689,4,B00004Z4U9,"The sight of Jeremy Irons as the Morlock leader was enough to drive me to the local video store to buy this mid-priced selection.
While the new version of the H. G. Wells novel plays to the contemporary youth market with the emphasis on the special effects to create the Wellsian idyll and the deformities of the Warlocks, it does miss the point a little.
This, the original, won an Oscar for the special effects and given the technology of the day it was clearly well deserved. The movie itself set the tone for science fiction movies too with it's original setting and the ability to show the passage of time through several devices such as the circulating sun and the tailors dummy.
It is the conception of the novel however, which for me emphasises the differences between this movie and the newer version. The central difference lies in the somewhat ordinariness of the society of the Eloi. They are living a simple, almost idyllic lifestyle, knowing nothing much about the world around them except what they need to know. They live in ruins with food and clothing provided for them. In the newer version there is some complex structures which do not make a whole lot of sense as they are still susceptible to raids from the Morlocks.
The Eloi suggest a socialist society where each according to ability each according to need whereas the Morlocks represent the evils of the capitalist machine. In the end of course, the victory over the Morlocks is achieved with the aid of our hero who's single minded devotion to rescuing the heroine culminates in defeat of the capitalist machine.
Thus the original time machine remains as true to the concept of the novel as perhaps it can be whereas the message of the new is obscured.
Certainly the original Time Machine is a little dated but it is worth it.",1017792000,,1803,4.672955974842767

The Bad Dudes - the ""Morlocks"" - are utterly ridiculous looking and simply not scary at all, unless the idea of be-mulleted, blue bodied hulks with bad back hair keep you up at night.

1382692,4,B00004Z4U9,"In 1960, filmmaker George Pal brought to fruition a visionary concept for a film based on a novel by H.G. Wells, about an inventor who builds a machine that enables him to travel through time, specifically into the future, where he learns a timeless, universal truth about the machinations of society and some of the basic tenets of human nature.  ""The Time Machine,"" which Pal produced and directed, stars Rod Taylor as George, the inventor/time traveler/hero, who, born into a time and world that doesn't suit him, decides to do something about it.
...
 Going into this project, George Pal had a definite vision of what he wanted to accomplish with this film, from the way the time machine itself looked, to the way he wanted to present the future of mankind and the world.  And working from the intelligent, imaginative screenplay by David Duncan, he succeeded by delivering a film that has since become a classic of the Science Fiction genre.  The nature of the story demands that the viewer suspend disbelief, of course, but Pal develops his story in such a plausible, straightforward manner that it is easy to do just that.  He puts George on the journey of a lifetime, and he takes his audience along for the ride.  He does an exquisite job of establishing the Victorian era in which the story begins, as well as the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The F/X he employs to convey the sense of George's movement through time-- like the swift arcing of the Sun and Moon, and the quick, subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes George observes-- are entirely effective.  Pal obviously had a devotion to detail that pays off handsomely here.  A dedicated filmmaker, he refused to settle for less than what he knew was right for his picture, and it shows.  The result is a film that is entertaining, timeless and memorable.
 As George, Rod Taylor is perfectly cast and gives a solid performance in which he embodies the boldness, the imagination and tenacity of his character.  Most importantly, he makes George believable and his motivations credible, which enables the viewer to be swept along with the story.  Taylor has a commanding presence that serves his character well, and he is, in fact, the veritable personification of the explorer/adventurer, a man willing to take a chance or face unbelievable odds to accomplish his goal.  Taylor is a fine actor who has made a number of movies, but of them all, this is the role for which he will probably be best remembered.
 Also perfect in her role is Yvette Mimieux, as one of the Eloi, Weena.  A talented actress-- now something of a `60s icon, in fact-- her fair beauty, along with the innocent demeanor and vulnerability she manages to convey, makes her character entirely convincing.  And the way she plays it makes George's actions more likely, as well.  Granted, her character is well written to begin with, but Mimieux's the one who sells it in the translation from page to screen.
 The supporting cast includes Doris Lloyd (Mrs. Watchett), Bob Barran (Eloi Man), James Skelly (Second Eloi Man) and Paul Frees (Voice of the Talking Rings).  A transporting flight of fantasy, expertly crafted and imaginatively presented, ""The Time Machine"" is captivating entertainment that will make you believe that time travel is possible.  it paints a bleak picture of the future, to be sure, but it gives you and leaves you with that which has kept Man putting one foot in front of the other since Time began:  Hope.  That's the legacy of H.G. Wells and the promise of George Pal.  And it's the magic of the movies.",1016064000,,3572,4.789559543230016

1382694,5,B00004Z4U9,"I've become a bit of a skeptic, and even more of a cynic over the years whenever I hear of a major production company doing a remake of an original movie. I've come to realize that 'remakes' rarely live up to the original, except perhaps in special effects (which they often surpass). But special effects does not a classic make, unless that's all you look for in a movie. I have no doubt that the 2002 release of 'The Time Machine' will trounce the original in this department, but everything else being equal, I doubt it will become a classic, as this movie has.
Having said that I must say the original 'Time Machine' is perhaps one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time. What makes this movie special is the great attention to plot and characterization, as well as keeping scrupulously to the H.G. Wells novel, both in content and in characterization. By contrast I've heard that the remake was quite revisionary.
Rod Taylor does a splendid job in portraying the inventor with a consciense, the man who must wrestle with questions that have no easy answers. The viewer can sympathize with his predicament of using his invention for the betterment - or detriment - of mankind, no easy task since he is surrounded by friends who can only think in terms of the material.
At the core of this movie is his friendship with David, played splendidly by Alan Young (Mr. Ed). One of the most noticeable things about this film is the commaraderie between these two men, as well as their differences: George, the idealist, and David, the pragmatic. Yet in SPITE of the differences, their friendship endures. This is especially seen in 'Time Machine: The Journey Back' a sequel (or followup) to the original movie and which is featured on the DVD.
The music score by Russell Garcia is another factor that makes this movie so special. It fits perfectly into each scene so seamlessly that you can't imagine another music score for this film.
In closing, the remake my be more exciting to watch, but I doubt if it will be as thought-provoking as the original, which in my opinion is the one, only, and future 'Time Machine'.",1015459200,,2115,4.657754010695188

Watching the film again today the elegance and detail in the design astonish me. The machine is unforgetable but its the intelligently crafted story and character filled casting in this version that can still fill young hearts with wonder at the possibilities of time travel. Its amazing how the initial half of the film seems as contemporary a tale as when it was first invented. It is only in the land of the far distant future that the film turns into a traditional pulp heroic adventure.  But the evil underground dwellers, the morlocks with their blue skin, white hair and glowing eyes remain quite scary and create wonderful tension and excitement. This is a really fun adventure film that warrants its classic status because it can still be apreciated today.
  Accompanying the film is a sentimental featurette documenting the finding of the original time machine in a thrift shop and its loving restoration. The film is hosted by the original star Rod Taylor who reprises his role with his co-star Alan Young (Wilbur Post on Mr. Ed) at the end of the feature performing a ten minute skit that imagines a scenario where H.George Wells returns in his time machine to convince his friend to time travel with him to prevent his death in a soon to happen WWI plane crash.

I absorbed every image, every sound, and I was there with Rod Taylor every step of the way. It was an exhilerating ride, and it's one I highly recommend that you take.

WB needs to get their freakin' act together and release better cases for their DVDs and insure quality in all releases. This disc tried to load for a while and stopped at 'No Play'. What fun!,979603200,,252,4.163265306122449
1382747,5,B00004Z4U9,"This movie is very entertaining. An inventor has constructed a time machine in the end of the 19th century. His friends don't believe it's true, even when he shows them a small size model. The last day of the century, he tests the time machine. He makes a first stop in 1917 (It's quite illogic here, that nobody has during all the years, walked up to his laboratory to look for him and found the time machine). He continues his journey through time and experiences the ruin of the civilization from a nuclear bomb. He ends up in about 80,000 years into the future. He finds a new civilization which, at first sight, seems to be a paradise. But he realizes something is wrong. He has to help the people, who are everything but driven to change their situation.
The Time Machine is a very good movie. It's a great story, good actors, scenery, and Academy Award winning special effects. The time machine looks really cool.",977875200,,920,4.548192771084337

This DVD is really incredible!  What they did to the soundtrack is great.  The movie sounds great in 5.1 and remember this movie is a 40 year old movie.  FOX should have taken lessons before the did Planet of the Apes in 5.1 (if you can call it that!)
Picture quality is superb.  But I do agree with another reviewer that the DVD cover could have been better, but I do see that another BOX set version of this movie is coming out this month with alot more goodies!",973123200,,661,4.053846153846154

The only video copy I had in my personal library was one that I taped from tv.  Boy, was I in for a surprise when I viewed my new DVD version.  It is stunning!  I must commend those who worked on the restoration...it is gorgeous.  It makes some newer movies that have been transferred to DVD, look sick.  At times, I forgot I was looking at a movie that is over 40 years old.  I found myself noticing details of the sets that I never saw before. If there is any drawback, it would be that the clarity of the picture brings attention to some matte paintings that were less than convicing.

1382751,5,B00004Z4U9,"Like most people, I had only seen this classic science fiction movie on television.  That never detracted from the story, which is one of the best that Wells wrote, but it didn't prepare me for how great this movie looks and sounds.  The DVD provides brilliant color and a generally sharp picture with only a little, infrequent  softness that I suspect is from the original film.  I was surprised at how clean the transfer is.  I did not see any scratches, dust or other defects.  The movie is presented in its original, widescreen aspect ratio.  The sound is also excellent.  It has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it is an excellent job for a movie that is forty years old.  As you would expect from such an old sound track, most of the action is in the center and front channels, but it uses the rear channels (especially noticable in key scenes, as when Rod Taylor is making echoes in the ruined dome building) and the subwoofer kicked in a few times, also.  The disc provides more extras than you would expect from a Warner release of an old movie.  It includes a trailer, filmographies for the three lead actors and George Pal, and a very good behind-the-scenes documentary.  The documentary was produced by Bob Burns 32 years after the making of the movie and focuses on the important part the time machine prop played in the making of the movie and it's history since, with an interesting account of how Burns found and then restored the original prop.  The documentary also features a scene in which Rod Taylor and Alan Young recreate their characters from the movie, acting out a scene that might have appeared in the movie but did not.  The scene uses the restored time machine prop to good effect and it was rather touching to see these much older actors slip so comfortably into their roles.  You could tell that this movie had been one of the high points of their careers and they remembered it fondly.  Likewise, Whit Bissel recreates his character in a short monologue full of a sense of nostalgia.  This old documentary was much more informative and interesting than a lot of the publicity puff pieces included on more recent films as extras. I highly recommend this DVD.  It delivers far more than I ever expected and does this classic movie justice.",970963200,,2277,4.621890547263682

For fans of the movie it doesnt get better than this. The film transfer is shown in its theatrical widescreen  version  and is digitally mastered from the original print. Included is a making of documentary hosted by Rod Taylor and can also be heard in 5.1 surround sound. I would have given this DVD a 5 star rating had they included some deleted scenes, and possibly an isolated music score. Sure its no Terminator 2 as far as special effects, but as far as story goes it still manages to keep me wanting to go up to the attic and get out my legos and erector sets and build a time machine of my own.",970531200,,772,4.280821917808219
1382753,5,B00004Z4U9,"Just finished watching this sci-fi classic! The picture quality has been masterfully restored as well as the audio content, and The Time Machine has never looked better!!!! The story of a young Victorian Era scientist who succeeds in conquering the most elusive of all man's quests....Time travel! His journey into the Fourth dimension propels the viewer into a fantastic vision of the future of mankind! In the year, 802,701A.D. George, the Time Traveler(portrayed marvelously by Rod Taylor),
encounters a nuclear-war resulting divison of the human species...the passive, surface-dwelling Eloi race and the subterranean, cannibalistic predators, the Morlocks! In a race to save the human remnants from complete extinction by the creatures of twilight in this strange world, George must use his wits and strength in an all out battle which will decide Mankind's fate!  Skillfully directed by George Pal (who also produced), this film stands as one of the most outstanding science-fiction films ever made, paving the way for imitations in the years following its initial release! Full of incredible, Academy Award-winning special effects (Gene Warren and Wah Chang, and the talents of Projects Unlimited), it holds it own against the computer-generated films of today !!! of compelling interest is the Time Machine vehicle itself, one of my favorite movie props!!! With a veteran supporting cast led by Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot and newcomer, Yvette Mimieux, this is one film that is in a word.... timeless! Favorably recommended and considered to be an all-time classic! Great viewing for any sci-fi fan! Based upon H.G. Wells' immortal novel...The Time Machine...his first and best work!",970531200,,1690,5.425855513307985
1382754,5,B00004Z4U9,"In the 1950s, director George Pal was best known for producing the film version of ""The War of the Worlds"" and for creating his numerous ""Puppetoons"" a decade earlier. Pal would go on to make ""The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao"" in 1964, but his most thoughtful film (in my opinion) will forever be ""The Time Machine"".
Going back to H.G. Wells, Pal insures a Victorian sentimentality that would've been present if the film had been made during the era in which it was written. Taking place on the literal eve of the new (20th) century, inventor George (Rod Taylor) invites a group of his friends to witness a demonstration of his new invention. When they arrive, they don't believe in the Time Machine that he has created. Even his best friend, Filby (delightfully played by Alan Young) has his doubts. Uninterested, they leave him to celebrate the new era.
Determined to travel through time, George uses the machine himself to find what's left of human civilization in the far future. (After fleeing World Wars and puzzling fashons.) He expects to find a Utopia, and he finds one of sorts - but it is not the paradise he expected. George discovers he must defend and teach these valueless humans (including the beautiful Weena played by Yvette Mimieux), lest they die out forever.
The film is an allegory for the rapidly diminishing Victorian mentality at the turn of the century, and George finds that his imagination and spirit of adventure are outdated within his own lifetime. ""The Time Machine"" not only reflects the spirit of Wells' own work but the swashbuckling fiction of the time, made whole with a sense of hope and empathy representing the perfect Victorian gentleman hero. This really is 19th Century science fiction at its best: filled with adventure, romance and in the end - depth.
(This review refers to the BOX SET COLLECTORS EDITION which features a 35mm film clip, a Senitype image from the film, lobby cards and black & white stills, a 27"" x 40"" original one-sheet and the original H.G.

Imagine my joy when  I saw it being used as the time machine in Carl Sagan's COSMOS TV series  (now *there's* another that deserves DVD treatment). George Pal outdoes  himself, with an story that's surprisingly faithtful to the spirit of the  original Wells novel - with romance, adventure, and visions of the future  thrown in, right down to a nuclear war in the 1980s and lava filling the  streets. One of the best things about the DVD format is the behind the  scenes features you can tag onto classic movies - sadly, not all movie  releases do this.

I first watched this movie on a Halloween night  on TV many years ago and just fell in love with it.  This viewing was years  before video became available so all I could look for was a sountrack album  to the terrific Garcia score.  Nope, it didn't exist.  Then along came  video.  I waited for years before it came out.  In all of that time it had  not been re-screened on UK TV so I was watching it again with nothing short  of a childhood memory that could have been devastated after so many years.  This was not to be the case.  It was still as good, if not better (as I had  since read the novel, read up on Pal and knew a lot more about the movie)  than it was when I first saw it.  My wife kind of wishes that I did not  like it so much as she finds the poster creepy (see front cover of DVD -  this was not used on the previous VHS versions) and I had hunted high and  low to obtain an original cinema poster which now hangs in our study.  I am  very pleased to see that MGM are tagging on the more recent documentary  that was released seperately over here but was so limited in its  distribution that I did not get a copy.  It features Rod recreating the  role of the Time Traveller (so I believe), some dialogue and behind the  scenes stuff.  I can only say that I was excited when Amazon sent the email  informing me that the movie was on its way and I ordered one right away.  If you've seen this movie and liked it, I believe that DVD will serve it  well.  If you have not seen this movie, don't let the fact that it was made  in 1960 put you off.

1382771,4,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is a grand epic retelling of the original Wells classic  of the same name, which doesn't entirely stick to the novel, but remains  faithful enough to be able to give off the same message the author intended  - the eventual decline of society as a result of high capitalism and rapid  technological development, creating a gulf between the rich and the poor,  the servants and the served. Rod Taylor is the Time Traveller, a young  inventor cheesed off at where society is heading, and, having made a time  machine, heads off into the future to see if things get better, and is  shocked at what he finds. Taylor is pretty good in the role, but comes off  as too fresh-faced and good-looking make-up wise - in other words, he looks  too much like a Hollywood hero, and not enough like the inventor and  scientist he is supposed to be. But his acting is compentant nevertheless,  and so is that of veteran actor Alan Young, as the very likeable Filby, the  Time Traveller's best friend. Had the book stuck firmly to the novel, we  wouldn't have seen much of him, however in the film, the traveller makes a  couple of stops in the twentieth century, and thus we see Young twice more  as Filby's son. Yvette Mimieux could only have been hired for her looks  (those Eloi look way too clean considering the absence of razors, soap and  hairbrushes!), because her acting is rather shoddy. The romance between her  and the traveller is too Hollywood soppy for my taste as well. But these  complaints are not major. They may chip away at the story's realism, but  they don't detract from its entertainment value as an action-adventure  movie.

1382784,5,B00004Z4U9,"The Time Machine is a film based around H G Wells' classic novel of the same name originally published in 1895. The film was made in 1960 by George  Pal starring Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimeux. As the name suggests it is  centred around George, an inventor, who is obsessed with the idea of time  travel. He invents a Time Machine which can travel backwards or forwards  through the fourth dimension. Rather than travelling back through time to  unravel the mysteries of the past George decides to go into the future and  find out man's ultimate destiny. He sets off on New Years eve 1899 and on  his way discovers the First World War, Second World War and a Nuclear War  in 1966. Disgusted with the fact that man appears to destroy himself he  decides to travel far into the future hoping to discover the utopia of  mankind's ultimate destiny. Instead, in the year 802,701, he discovers the  false utopia of the Eloi and the Morlocks. Initially he discovers the Eloi  who appear to have reached the ultimate utopian dream of days of leisure  left to ponder philosophy with a perfect society free from violence and the  ills of the society he has left behind. However it soon becomes clear that  all is not what it appears. His first doubts appear when he witnesses Weena  (Yvette Mimeux) drowning in a river while her companions look on without  sympathy or emotion. Then he finds the Eloi have no interest beyond idle  (but not idyllic) days of nothingness. Indeed they have no interest in the  intellect whatsoever evidenced when George finds their library has crumbled  to dust. He soon realises the utopia he first encountered is a sham and the  Eloi are a meaningless race that will never advance beyond their  meaningless existence - and yet Weena begins to show him that there may be  more to the Eloi than first appears. She shows a willingness to express the  human spirit, an expression that the spark of life is not completely  extinct. Soon George begins to learn of another race in mankinds future -  the Morlocks - a sinister and more complex race who still retain a mastery  of science. Things become more apparent, both with the revelation that the  Eloi's do not survive beyond their youth and that the Morlocks hold an  unexplainable dominance over them. He discovers 'talking rings' which  explain that, after the Nuclear War, man divided between those who chose to  live on the planets surface, the Eloi, and those who chose to live  underground, the Morlock's. George's Time Machine has been taken by the  Morlocks and he therefore determines to enter their underground world to  both retrieve the machine and discover their sinister secret... Whilst  trying this the truth begins to unravel - sirens blaze and the Eloi,  catatonically, enter the undergound world of the Morlocks. Weena is one of  those who enters the Morlocks lair. By this time George appears to be  entranced by Weena and is desperate to save her. He enters the world of the  Morlock via one of the many ventilation shafts they have to supply their  oxygen. The final truth stands before him - the Morlocks are farming the  Eloi for food - CANNIBALISM... In a desperate bid to save Weena he attacks  the Morlocks, who are blinded by light, and - just as he is about to be  defeated - one of the Eloi's summons the courage to attack the  Morlocks. After this momentous event the other captured Eloi join in and  over-power their foe. The Eloi escape and this rouses their whole tribe to  block the Morlocks means of oxygen by destroying the ventilation shafts.  Just as George regains his Time Machine the entrance doors to the Morlock  lair shut, trapping him. He has no choice but to travel in time to avoid the  attentions of the few Morlocks who remain alive. Back in 1900 his  colleagues, except one called James Philby, mock him and do not believe his  story. Finally George perceives his destiny - to help the Eloi rebuild a  new mankind - he travels back to AD 802,701 and places his Time Machine  outside the Morlocks lair so re-uniting with Weena and the tribe. Does he  ever return? - we will never know... A great story and the film is the  icing on the cake. Bearing in mind it was made about 40 years ago, before  hi-technology graphics, and on a relatively low budget George Pal's  rendition is sublime. An underrated film it rates as a Classic (perhaps on  a par with others of my favourites - Planet of The Apes / Omega Man , I Am  Legend) ......",941155200,,4452,4.618925831202046

Even though the special effects are ""dated""  and reveal at times the ""effects"" of low budget, they manage to  hold up over repeated viewings much like Pal's The War of the Worlds.  The  Victorian atmosphere of The Time Machine is as vivid as the strangeness of  the world in 802,701AD. In spite of its genre', the film manages to  effectively portray the need for preserving our human-ness throughout time.
