I did not have high expectations as this is not a big band, but I have plenty of dvd's from lesser known bands that look like big production jobs compared to this!!

First off, it seems the sound must have come right off the sound board, as you can actually hear the levels changing on the different instruments within a songs, quite drastically at times. So the sound is never good, and sounds quite dry. Also the video editing is horrible, but I could have lived with it were it not for the sound quality. It is only about 1 hour long and I had a hard time getting through it it was so bad!! Save your money!!!",1230076800,,731,4.147887323943662
