8354830,5,B0027ISIZ2,"The 13 episode Silver Surfer - the animated series lived a brief life on the FOX kids network in 1998. Recalling the drawing style of Jack Kirby, the series decoupled the Silver Surfer from the Fantastic Four legend and reinvents the mythos of Silver Surfer as the herald/nemesis of the world eater Galiticus. The series then introduces many important figures from Marvel's Cosmos, like Thanos and the Watcher while tackling themes such as slavery, imperialism, the collective unconscious and the nature of reality. Pretty heady stuff for kids at the approach of the new millenium. 8 additional episodes were scripted but never filmed. The series was halted purportedly because of a legal dispute between Marvel and Fox. Thus the series ended with dangling threads and speculation of what might have been. The series was only made available for sale in the UK and is now hard to come by and fetcing exorbitant prices. Snag a bootleg if you can ( hint- check out your local comic book store to see what might be for sale under the table). Highly recommended.",1438473600,3,1057,4.877777777777778
