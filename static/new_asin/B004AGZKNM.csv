8420238,5,B004AGZKNM,"Nick and two tournament casters teach three different casts to a young lady who doesn't appear to have any experience. The instructions are clear and they point out common errors I was making.

I went fishing after watching the first chapter. My range increased significantly the first time I tried the methods described in the video. And, I haven't even started learning the more advanced casts taught later in the video. I expect more improvement will come when I practice them.

I'm so happy, I just ordered two more videos from the the author's website. (Search for ""Nickaway"" on the Internet.)",1307750400,,598,4.910891089108911
