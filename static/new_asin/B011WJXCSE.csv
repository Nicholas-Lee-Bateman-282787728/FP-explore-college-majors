These amazing women are very comfortable in their own skin and it radiates on their faces and on their lives. I was very enlighten to the struggles of the models of color in the early days and appreciated the viewpoint of these groundbreaking models. I can highly recommend this piece to women who will become older and for women who are already there. Inspiring!!!!",1483315200,,457,4.725
