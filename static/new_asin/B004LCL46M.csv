8434230,5,B004LCL46M,"This is one of the Best DVD's that I own. My Father was a Bombardier on B24's. The DVD explained things to me that my father has attempted to explain to me most of my life. The training films that were used in the DVD are great. I would recommend this DVD along with the book ""The Legendary Top Secret Norden Bombsight to anyone who has an interest in how the bombsight works.",1346284800,,376,4.164383561643835
