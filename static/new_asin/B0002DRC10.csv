2080963,4,B0002DRC10,"I saw this movie as a teenager.  As a long time fan of Lee Majors, I enjoyed this.  There's a wry and winsome ""ballad"" sang in pieces throughout the movie.  There's a great action scene with Lee Majors racing down the road on a motorcycle while being pursued by local cops.  The beautiful Joey Heatherton stars as his former sweetheart.  There's some action and drama--particulary between Lee Majors and his dad [Pat Hingle]and with his old partner [Jimmmy Dean].  This story exemplifies the fact that you never can go home. A good movie.",1105056000,9,538,4.731182795698925
2080964,4,B0002DRC10,"If you came from the bottom of the food chain in this ERA of the sixties, you will fully relate to this film.  This movie is a time capsule from our country; if you were in the military back then, well, when watching this old movie you will be digging up bones.",1381968000,,261,4.019230769230769
2080965,5,B0002DRC10,A GREAT MOVIE WITH LEE MAJORS AND JOEY HEATHERTON.WOW.it should not be missed. It will hold your breath  away. Must see it,1378944000,,122,4.545454545454546
2080966,4,B0002DRC10,"After watching this tv made movie I was reminded of three other tv shows Lee Majors was in and found this movie to be must have for any fan. I was very satisfied with the DVD, and of the delivery I look forward to doing more business.",1334966400,,234,4.0
2080967,4,B0002DRC10,"Seminal Vietnam-vet-returns-home flick in the form of a TV movie. Low-budgeted, a bit rickety and soapy but sensitive and stark. Lee Majors [of TV series fame: Six Million Dollar Man, 1973; The Big Valley, 1965; The Virginian, 1970], plays the naive war-hero vet who returns to his hometown of Who Cares, USA. The wooden, almost boyish Majors was perfect for this role. The homeboy returns to find that his ex-girlfriend is now married and his business partner has neglected the biz [a beloved motorcycle repair shop] and left it a mess. It is apparent that people just went on with their lives in his absence: hey, life goes on, buddy, and old friends often don't come through. He is uninformed, objectified and deluded. He goes to Nam and is spit back an anachronistic misfit. Has a brief, unwitting encounter with the drug culture in California and then with the changing times & mores back home. Lots of interesting supports, including: Joey Heatherton, whose ripe sensuality made every male in the 60's dodge the draft, as his ex-gal; Jimmy Dean [yes, of Jimmy Dean sausage and Billboard #1 pop hit Big Bad John, 1961, fame], in an excellent performance, as his perturbingly loud, avaricious and conniving partner; veteran character actor Pat Hingle [kick-butt as the Judge in HANG 'EM HIGH, 1968], in another excellent performance, plays the vet's staunch dad; the great supporting actress Agnes Moorehead [TV series Bewitched, 1964, and a memorable villain with Bogey in the awesome noir DARK PASSAGE, 1947], plays Joey's rich mom---and wants the vet to get lost; Bobby Hatfield, of 60's iconic pop music group The Righteous Brothers [remember the classic ballad Unchained Melody from GHOST,1990], plays an old friend who can't help; and even hall-of-fame Motown great Marvin Gaye as his Nam pal. Peter Haskell, a vastly underappreciated character actor in many a 70's TV movie [a great psychotic stalker in LOVE HATE LOVE, 1971], has a neat cameo as the leader of a band of drug-using hippies who ridicules the war hero. The poorly educated vet tries to resurrect his dying biz and even get his girl back. In the meantime, dad wants him to face up, abandon seemingly hopeless pursuits and spurious friends, and get a 'real' job. When Dean sells the business without his approval, the vet angrily assaults his partner and now has to run from the law. Goes back to army pal Gaye, who is married, but he seems to be an inconvenience to his pal's spouse. Winds up back where he feels most comfortable ---sitting on the stoops of a US Army recruitment center one lonely night. Simple but important and relevant period piece. Soft country-rock soundtrack [this at the dawn of the 70's soft country-rock boom], with wry lyrics a nice accompaniment. Interesting that Heatherton was a Bob Hope USO tour participant for our Nam troops---great lady. As for the DVD itself, I purchased the Miracle Pictures one. Don't expect much, it's a bit grainy and a bit fuzzy with no extras but overall an acceptable watchable transfer. I just thank them for making this personally long-remembered little TV movie available, and I am very happy to have it in my collection.",1255132800,2,3158,4.904672897196262
2080968,1,B0002DRC10,This was a good made for TV movie back in '69 when the war was still hot. Seems a little dated now but I guess we all are if you were there. What ruined it for me was the LOUSEY film to DVD transfer! The best scene was at the end with Crocker (Majors) sitting on the curb waiting for the recruting office to open...,1241740800,,315,3.8615384615384616
2080969,2,B0002DRC10,"It's hard to get ripped off on a purchase under $10, but this one did it. the movie was fine but the DVD quality was horrible. At least the original recording was horrible. This movie should never have been distributed on DVD without restoration of the original.",1238025600,3,262,4.595744680851064
2080970,4,B0002DRC10,"""The Ballad of Andy Crocker"" is a TV movie made when the American public had turned against the Vietnam War and begun to focus its frustration on returning veterans. Almost all young male stars of the era, luminaries such as Robert De Niro, John Voight, Bruce Dern, Dennis Hopper and Martin Sheen, were constantly cast as deeply troubled, highly troublesome Vietnam returnees. Veterans of the unpopular war suddenly became the only minority that Hollywood could safely bash and the studios went about it with a vengeance. One can easily compare contemporary cinematic depictions of Vietnam-era American veterans with Hollywood's monolithic, often blatantly racist portrayals of German and Japanese soldiers during World War II. Unlike the slew of derogatory movies however, ""Andy Crocker"" brings us Lee Majors in the title role of a young veteran whose main problem isn't post-traumatic stress, drug addiction or a total disregard for the value of human life but the challenge of adjusting to a society which has changed radically during his war service. In San Francisco he clashes with arrogant, self-righteous hippies, swipes one of their motorcycles and runs for the tranquility of the hinterlands, only to discover that those he left behind and their view of what he's perceived to have become are not at all what he anticipated. The cast is made up of memorable veteran actors Agnes Moorehead, Pat Hingle and Jill Haworth, and and newcomers like singers Jimmy Dean, Marvin Gaye and Bobby Hatfield, plus the sultry Joey Heatherton, all of whom do marvelous jobs in their roles of individuals of various types caught up in a simmering undercurrent of social upheaval. This is an extremely low budget film though, and unfortunately it hasn't been remastered; the kinescoped DVD version is no less jumpy and fuzzy than a homegrown VHS capture. Nevertheless ""The Ballad of Andy Crocker"" is a relevant, highly entertaining drama which offers a rare and realistic insight into life during a significant era in the history of the United States. It's just too bad the story couldn't have been made into a big budget feature film rewritten and directed by Oliver ""Born on the Fourth of July"" Stone a few years later.",1191283200,3,2212,5.079670329670329
2080971,4,B0002DRC10,"Majors, shortly after the success of his supporting role in Tom Gries, Will Penny(1968)with Charleton Heston, starred in this made for tv movie about a decorated Vietnam veteran who comes home to less than hero's welcome. Majors plays the lead (Andy Crocker), seriously and with conviction; supporting cast, Pat Hingle, Jimmy Dean, and Joey Heatherton are also quite good. Like ""Friendly Fire"" (1978), a made for tv movie that won several Emmys and made its debut several years later, The Ballad of Andy Crocker is a film that really should be just as memorable. Incidentally, this was an Aaron Spelling pilot for a series that never actually materialized. Too bad, it would have made for an interesting series.

Unlike the spate of ""crazed"" Vietnam Vet films that would follow for the next decade a la ""Deer Hunter,"" ""First Blood"" and the ""Rambo"" series, this film seriously tries to depict the problems of readjustment to civilian life many vets faced back in the States. Andy finds that his fiance has left him to marry another man, his business partner (Dean), has cheated him, and his father and mother notably estranged from him. In short, the film's ending packs a wallop and is a real testament to the trials and misfortunes so many Vietnam vets faced in their readjustment after the Vietnam War.",1151539200,12,1304,4.900452488687783
2080972,2,B0002DRC10,The movie was just too disjointed.  It did not flow at all.  Lee Majors was good enough in the role but he wasn't given much to work with.  Definite feel of a low budget TV movie.,1145577600,,179,3.9166666666666665

8027060,5,B0002DRC10,"I watched this old movie on TV, in Fort Bliss, Texas, where I was going through the Army Vietnamese Language School, JUST before going to Vietnam, as a 5-man Special Forces Team commander.  I always remembered the dismal, depressing, sad ending that hit home so well.  But couldn't remember the name of the movie, only the background theme song about a ""Scramble Track Rider"".  The song and lyrics stuck in my mind for 40+ years, and I found this on this good internet.  Brings back a lot of memories.  Joey Heatherton was hot!",1487548800,3,527,4.623655913978495
8027061,3,B0002DRC10,This is a t.v. movie.  Lee Majors plays a Viet Nam veteran returning home.  To find everything has changed.  His girl friend has gotten married and is also pregnant.  Played by Joey Heatherton.  I was nine years old when this came out.  And she was my first celebrity crush.  Pat Hingle plays his father.  And Jimmy Dean plays his business partner.  Who runs his motorcycle shop into the ground.  This is a good movie.  Although being made for t.v. it is only about an hour and twenty minutes long.,1476230400,,498,4.48314606741573

I must say even though his part wasn't a very big one, I liked his acting. He was as smooth and natural like he was on stage. I liked his role. The loving husband and caring friend, which I believe he was in real life. He just seemed like a nice guy. There is another movie that I'm going to purchase that he starred in. The Ballad of Andy Crocker wasn't a bad movie. This will go in my Marvin Gaye collection!!",1382313600,,520,3.961904761904762
