7956887,5,B00005YAQ2,Sperm whales are rarely photographed.  Even the the excellent Blue Planet series they only make a brief cameo.  This video has two breath taking scenes.  The first is an encounter between a baby Sperm whale and the crew where they are practically playing with this massive toddler.  The other is a mating scene which I had never scene before with whales.  Great stuff.  I highly recommend this video.,1071964800,5,400,4.8088235294117645
