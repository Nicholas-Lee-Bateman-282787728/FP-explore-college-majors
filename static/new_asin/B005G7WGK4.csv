8471272,2,B005G7WGK4,"Enjoyed interview with actual pilots and some of the film clips.  Much of the film scenes however were either unrelated to the narration or just inaccurate.  For example, it would talk about the F94 thunder streak while showing film clips of the F86.  Similarly it would show film clips of 4 F94s painted in Russian colors and insignia like it was pulled from a movie, and described as Mig15s when they are visually very different planes.  Also, many of the film clips were from WWII, like one clip of a Fw190 being shot down or mustangs being manufactured.  Otherwise, narrated content was good.  Film clips were poorly researched and selected as they were inaccurate at least half the time.",1483401600,,692,4.773109243697479

8471275,4,B005G7WGK4,"Jets Over Korea is a good, though conventional, look at the air war over the Korean peninsula from 1950-1953. It looks at various aircraft employed during the Korean conflict over the years of warfare.

The DVD does a decent job of setting up the viewer for the first jet-vs-jet combat in history with a little background on American jet design after WWII and the opening stages of the communist invasion of the south. American jets are shown flying intercept and ground-support missions with F-80 Shooting Stars, F-84 Thunderjets and USN F-9 Panther jets which were very conventional straight-wing aircraft. The shock of the swept-wing MiG-15 which outperformed American jets is covered and the point is made that, since the fall of the Evil Empire, we now know of all the Soviet and Chinese pilots that flew against Americans.

It does cover the introduction of the F-86 Sabre to counter the MiG-15 and how combat in ""MiG Alley"" became important to American flyers in the war. The relative merits of the Sabre vs. the MiG are covered and the critical features of the American jet were the excellent visibility (since the days of Oswald Boelcke, pilots have understood that whoever sights the enemy first will probably win the fight) of the canopy and the hydraulic controls which allowed the American jet better maneuverability. Of course, the DVD doesn't mention that both aircraft owe much to late-war German research and the ME262.

There's a lot of good film footage here and not just of the F-86. There's a lot of good video of the Thunderjet, the Shooting Star and the Panther too in combat including gun-camera footage. The DVD isn't always well presented and sometimes the narrative stumbles, but it's a good look at jet combat during the time period. A solid four-star DVD.",1424563200,5,1784,4.900662251655629
