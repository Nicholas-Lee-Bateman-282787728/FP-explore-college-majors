8315811,3,B001KQFA3K,"Following her film debut in 2003 in Bollywood's TUJHE MERI KASAM, Genelia D'Souza, brimming with vivacious life, went on to co-star in BOYS, her first venture in the Tamil film industry (or Kollywood). Sadly, BOYS is a lukewarm teen dramedy which chronicles the adventures of five boys and one girl. If not for the two central actors, Siddharth Narayan and Genelia D'Souza, this would've been truly unwatchable. As it is, the film starts excruciatingly but gets better as it progresses.

The first forty-five minutes suck on a primal level, focusing as it does on the dumb and unfunny antics of the five teenage boys who waste their time either perched on a wall or chasing skirt, futilely. All five happen to fall in crush with the lovely Harini (Genelia), which wouldn't have amounted to diddly (because all five crash and burn dismally), except that one of the guys is Munna, played by lead actor Siddharth. The other boys get over their infatuation when Harini is talked into setting them up with her girlfriends. But Munna persists in pursuing Harini. In due time, with the reluctant Harini at last caving in to the pressures brought about by the Sacred Indian Cinema Cliche, she professes her love for him (by scrawling sweet nothings on his palm). But this is only after an act of overt stupidity on Munna's part and consequently his landing in prison.

The real plot kicks off with Munna's horrified parents gazing at a newspaper photo of their nude son running the streets of Chennai. They promptly call their own little town hall meeting, consisting of all the teens involved and their parents. What results is a colossal rift between children and parents. Learning that Munna and Harini love each other, Harini's parents plan to immediately ship her off to America, this intent forcing the desperate young couple to elope. And if you think their parents were furious before... Anyway, Munna and Harini strike out on their own (except that they're accompanied by Munna's four chums).

This is the point where the film becomes interesting, as the newlyweds and their friends struggle to survive, all six sleeping in a claustrophobic garage room, taking up menial jobs, while still trying to attend school. This can't last, of course. The kids realize this and brainstorm, eventually arriving at that most logical solution: hey, why not become rock stars?

There actually are concomitant scenes which support this rock star epiphany, so this plan doesn't seem as ridiculous. The film earlier on had established that some of the boys play musical instruments and that Munna is kind of a poet (so there's your lyricist). A popular devotional track later and an anti-governmental tune later, the boys (and girl) get a shot at the big time.

There's much that falls flat in this film and at near three hours long, that's a lot of falling flat, with most of the film's limp humor concentrated in the painful first forty-five minutes or so. But it's worth mentioning that the film gets an instant upgrade once it veers away from the aimless milling around of the randy teens and shifts the focus decisively to Siddharth and Genelia. This is their first pairing in cinema, and they won't hook up again until three years later in the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bommarillu/dp/B000UEHZ9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bommarillu</a>. But BOYS becomes entirely watchable in those moments when these two share screen time.

BOYS resurrects that dusty old bone of contention between strict traditional Indian values and the contemporary mindset of today's youth. It's almost as if you forfeit your Indian cinema filmmaking license if you leave out some form of melodramatic family crisis. This movie, though, seems to go out of its way to vilify the parents, at the cost of some believability. Putting aside the ridiculous amount of silly (and that oh-so-exasperating kid who makes lizard/dinosaur noises), there are other scenes which don't go over well, most notably that tragic hospital scene, which is undermined by unconvincing blubbering on the part of the grieving characters, and the MTV award show near the end, in which the kids seemingly win every damn statue being doled out.

What does the Indian cinema do when it gets its hands on f/x technology from THE MATRIX? Why, it applies it promptly to a musical number (in ""Ale Ale""). There's also some shaky CG inserted into the cheerful track ""Boom Boom."" Eleven songs in this one, which is why the film is just about three hours long. But I do like most of the musical numbers, including the bouncy second ditty ""Dating"" and especially those songs being ""performed"" by the cast, from the devotional ""Lyyappo"" to the drum-heavy, youth-rallying ""Break the Rules"" and their glitzy MTV performance ""Secret of Success (Saregame).""

BOYS lowers the curtains with a happy ending, thanks to some trickeration played by the kids' manager, and the camera pans in to a final shot of Siddharth Narayan and Genelia D'Souza, the two primary reasons to spend one eighth of a day with this otherwise pedestrian film. And watching Genelia, even this early in her film career but spirited as she is, and bright and lovely, how can you not be enchanted?",1234310400,,5241,5.043879907621247
