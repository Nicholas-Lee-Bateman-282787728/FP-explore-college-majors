8653972,1,B00092ZE6E,"Throw this DVD of the critical review of Nirvana in and it starts out with about 20 seconds of great live footage before some goofball idiot interrupts the footage to tell us why Nirvana was a great band. The reason I bought the DVD was because I already figured that out. Save your money, this junk belongs in the trash. Retard after retard interrupting the concert footage and telling us what they think. Can I have my money back? All I want is the live footage, no commentary, no opinions. This is junk and doesnt even deserve a 1 rating. If anyone wants mine for the 15 bucks I spent I would be happy to ship it to you.",1143504000,4,623,4.243697478991597
