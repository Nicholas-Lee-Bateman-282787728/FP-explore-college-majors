5425513,4,B00AHREQMY,"When I purchased the Thorne set based on two books by Mark Billingham, Id forgotten that many years ago I had read a couple of the series and found them to be repetitive variations on DI Tom Thorne and his intuitive investigations of bizarre and grisly crimes.  If youve read one of Billinghams ghoulish shock-shlock novels, youve pretty well read them all.  Fortunately, the tightly-scripted, well-acted two stories represented in Series 1 rise above the nasty source material.

In Sleepyhead, David Morrisey stars as Thorne as he investigates a series of brutal attacks on young women, all but two of whom have died.  One of the living is confined to a hospital bed where she is paralyzed from the neck down and locked in  able to hear and understand everything around her but totally unable to communicate, a condition described as like waking up in your own coffin.  The other survivor remembers nothing at all about the attack.  Aided by the always-excellent Morrissey and a first-rate supporting cast, including Aidan Gillen (GoTs Littlefinger) as Thornes pathologist sidekick, Natascha McElhone as a neurologist, the gorgeous Aisling Loftus (Mr. Selfridge) as her daughter, and the ever-reliable Eddie Marsan as Thornes bitter ex-partner, Sleepyhead is gripping from start to finish.  Brian McCardie (Line of Duty) also makes the most of his brief screen time. Particular kudos are due Sara Lloyd-Gregory, who turns in an astonishing performance as the paralyzed victim, using only her eyes, her face, and her voice-over.  By turns terrified, enraged, and mordantly funny, Ms. Gregory steals every scene in which she appears.

In Scaredycat, Thorne investigates a series of killings that may represent the work of two killers working in tandem.  Though a suspect is quickly arrested, Thorne convinces his superiors to release him to use as bait to find his presumed partner, of whom the suspect is terrified.  The recurring cast (including Gillen and Marsan, along with O.T. Fagbenle and Lorraine Ashbourne) are again first-rate, and the story features excellent performances from Tom Brooke and Joe Absolom (Doc Martin) as the main suspects.  Sandra Oh is less memorable as a cop whose serious personal problems complicate the investigation.  With enough red herrings to stock a fish market and a far-from-surprising ending, Scaredycat is pretty clearly the lesser of the two stories.

On balance, Series 1 of Thorne is well worth the time, if mostly for the excellence of the ensemble acting, which transcends the brutish plots of the books and sidesteps the question of why any real police force would ever tolerate Tom Thornes bizarre behavior and over-the-line investigations.",1420588800,,2688,5.21860465116279

5425515,1,B00AHREQMY,"Not worth half what was paid for it.  After, Morse, Lewis and countless others, this show was a total BORE.  Spend your money on something interesting.",1406160000,,151,4.769230769230769
5425516,1,B00AHREQMY,"This series central character is flat and loveless due to throwing up so many themes / characters in the script that it is difficult to connect to any of them.  Any given two would have been worthy of development of depth.  The DVD is the only episodes produced.

My guess is that ""Thorne"" will be redone in the future by more capable hands.",1391212800,,341,4.380952380952381
5425517,5,B00AHREQMY,"I gave the Thorne disc 5 stars because the film is clear and beautifully done, with great sound and added subtitles. Morrisey is one of my favorite actors. He does a splendid job in the off-beat murder mystery series. The stories are compelling, modern, and a bit raw, but such is the life of crime fighting. The British seem to be number one in TV detective and crime. Thorne stands out from the formulas of Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynly, etc...and shine sright up there with Inspector Lewis. Hope to see more episodes soon.
The discs are perfect, well-packaged, well-priced. The service is excellent.",1385424000,,606,4.893203883495145
5425518,5,B00AHREQMY,"If you are a big fan of British thrillers like George Gently,Wire in the Blood,Rebus, Luther,etal like I am, you will LOVE this Thorne Mystery series. I bought it sight unseen knowing how great the brits do cop procedural and thought it was awesome. Why? Because the characters are complex, the pace is 'slower' than American shows like CSI--but the finish is always richer in my view. Here, you get 2 installments of Detective Thorne solving serial killer murders. Each last about 90 minutes and the great thing about Acorn Media is they always provide closed caption which is very helpful with british accents. I will order the next installment of this show the minute it appears on Amazon.",1370390400,47,692,4.823529411764706

5425520,5,B00AHREQMY,"Thorne was a nice surprise for me as I had never seen it or even had heard of it before. I picked it up based on other reviews and I am glad I did.
The stories are well told  gripping dramas. The lead detective Thorne is a great character he has more flaws than most and is his own worst enemy.
I like the TV show so much that I am now  ordering the books and hope they are as good if not better than the series..",1368057600,13,413,3.735632183908046

5425522,5,B00AHREQMY,"I like police procedurals. I like all things British. So this new drama fits the bill for me. I haven't read the books on which this miniseries is based on so I don't have any preconceived notions. I found both stories gripping, and the acting very believable. I hope they make more episodes and this becomes part of the pantheon of British crime fiction.",1364515200,8,355,4.5625

Sandra Oh, lately from a Shondra Rhyme, series in the US. She plays Thorne's sidekick, who has a lot to learn, and should stay away from that cocaine. She wants to improve her lot in life, and be the best policewoman around. However, she is working with the best there is, Thorne. He has premonitions about murderers and specializes in serial killers. After each murder, he can visualize the murder in  his mind's eye. In this particular case, he finds a little boy who has been hiding in a kitchen closet for two days after the murder of his mother. He becomes attached to this boy, Charlie, and Charlie attached to him.  Now he must find the murderers, and there may be more than one.

Thorne is a tough guy,moody, sees life in black and white, and he rarely smiles. He does, however,give thanks for a job well done, and that is something you do not see often.
