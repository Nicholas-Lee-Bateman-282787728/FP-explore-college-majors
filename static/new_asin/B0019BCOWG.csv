8273197,5,B0019BCOWG,"He never disappoints me in his shows. With science and wit, this show is a hit (hey that rhymes - that was unintentional).

The only thing I am disappointed is that all of his shows are not on DVD that I can see. Why is that? I have all of his books of Good Eats 1, 2 & 3, but its more exciting to see them on TV to see how he does things and explains things. The books are half the story.

He is highly recommended in any show. He is my favorite.",1375488000,,447,3.74468085106383
