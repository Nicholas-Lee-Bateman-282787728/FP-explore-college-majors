8385768,5,B0030CPKDW,"Great dvd if you're interested in learning about Muslim history and Islam's contributions to society especially in the context of interfaith empowerment and dialogue. Judaism, Christianity and Islam essentially come from the same source, I.e. God. Hence they must have some similarities; that should be our focus for interfaith harmony. Our differences make us unique. God will be the judge on the Day of Resurrection and those on the right path will be rewarded tremendously. Let us work together for the good and await patiently for our reward. This I have learned from the Prophet/Messenger of Islam, Muhammad. So watch this DVD and you will know what I am talking about.",1374624000,,674,5.081081081081081

5.0 out of 5 stars The Myth of ""Moderate"" Islam, May 25, 2011

Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)

This review is from: The Third Jihad: Radical Islam's Vision for America (DVD)

This is an outstanding DVD, made by a Muslim, and packed with hard evidence: videos of Islamic leaders proclaiming their goal of destroying Western culture, not through imminent terrorism, but rather through deception and infiltration--a long-term goal to conquer the entire world and make all countries Islamic theocratic states subject to the law of Sharia. The DVD exposes how purportedly ""moderate"" Islamic leaders in the United States and elsewhere are anything but. Many are caught on tape advocating terrorism and the ultimate goal of global Islamic rule. Many of the main purportedly ""moderate"" Islamic leaders in the United States have been convicted on terrorism charges. The extreme repressiveness of Saudi Arabia, America's purported ally, is exposed, as is their massive exportation of extremist Wahhabist teachings through establishment of so-called ""madrassahs"" throughout the mideast, Asia and yes, the United States and Europe. The Wahhabist sect is one of the most extreme and violent of Islamic sects. The madrassahs established by the Saudis teach intolerance, hatred of the west and violent terrorist tactics to children throughout the world, starting from very early ages. They have created the Islamic extremists, terrorists, and suicide bombers of today, and tomorrow.
Despite all phony denials--as expressly admitted in this DVD by many of the major Islamic leaders in the U.S.--the ultimate goal of Islam is total global conquest. The current violent terrorist acts and wars are merely feints designed--quite successfully--to keep attention away from the real jihadist movement, which is to infiltrate and destroy western democracies from within.
For various reasons--extending from oil profits for corporations to ""political correctness""--the United States and most of Europe (the Netherlands being an exception)--have propagated the myth that Islamic extremists are simply a tiny fringe group representing no more than 1-2% of Muslims worldwide. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
On the morning of 9/11, news programs showed film of massive crowds pouring into the streets of Palestine, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and elsewhere in joyous, ecstatic celebration of the horrible attacks on America and the deaths of so many thousand innocent citizens.
Since that time, these videos have been suppressed, because they don't fit with the government's false assurances that the ""real"" Islam is a peaceful religion and that the terrorists represent only a tiny minority who have allegedly ""hijacked"" Islam.
Polls in many Islamic countries have established that more than half of all Muslims either ""supported,"" ""sympathized with"" or ""admired"" Osama Bin Laden.
The majority of Islamic sects are not peaceful, or tolerant, or respectful of basic human rights. Among the worst are the Wahhabists who dominate Saudi Arabia and whose goals of terrorism and global conquest have been exported by Saudi Arabia around the world.
American authorities stand idly by while these enemies of America send imams into U.S. prisons to brainwash and recruit many African-Americans and others to adopt their teachings of hate. This must stop.
Wahhabist principles--including the goal of Islamic global conquest and the morality of killing all non-Muslims--are also taught throughout the United Stated in mosques, Islamic centers and through Islamic groups and websites, many of whom purport to be ""moderate"" and on the surface lie and disavow such things.
I am a far-left Democrat. I voted for Obama three times, walked precincts for George McGovern, and have never voted for a Republican in my life. This is NOT a partisan issue. This is the most serious threat we have faced since Adolf Hitler and the Japanese in World War II.
There is no possibility of avoiding a Third World War of the West versus Islam. The Muslims have made that inevitable.
America and Europe need to wake up and stop pretending that Islam is just a peaceful religion with no goal of global conquest. If we keep our heads in the sand much longer, it will be too late.
Watch this Muslim-produced DVD. You will be absolutely shocked at what your government has NOT been telling you, and the absolute lies that it has been telling you.",1362355200,2,4723,5.296395193591455
