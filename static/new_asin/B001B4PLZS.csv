3484307,3,B001B4PLZS,"Okay, the five-star viewer above me said ""gritty and stylish,"" and that it is to a slight degree, however, on a lesser rating scale, it was also a bit slow, and some parts didn't make a whole lot of sense or were simply unnecessary, even after reflecting on them later. The acting was superb, yes, but the screenplay left quite a bit to be desired. More of the terrible and gripping side of prison life would have been appropriate and would have lent itself greatly to the suspense level of the film along with providing a greater likability or dislike-ability for the most important characters involved.

On a much larger rating scale, the whole going back and forth between the actual escape and what occurred leading up to the escape throughout the entire movie proved to be the movie's only major downfall...but it was a big one. If the movie had been filmed as a consequent set of events, the suspense would have been on the ""nail-biting"" level, but since you already know what's happened while you watch the past, it dampers the whole flick in a big way. There is a slightly unexpected twist at the end, but it wasn't good enough to save this movie from any more than three stars.

Valiant effort, but lacking.

3484308,5,B001B4PLZS,"THE ESCAPIST, written by Daniel Hardy and Rupert Wyatt who also is the amazingly fine director, takes place almost entirely in a London prison. The main character is Frank (Brian Cox, in a brilliant turn) is a lifer who receives a note that his daughter is a junkie in dire straits and becomes obsessed with escaping prison to make amends with her. He gathers a strange, disparate group of fellow inmates to complete tasks in his carefully planned but exceptionally dangerous escape: Brodie (Liam Cunningham) has the brains, Viv Batista (Seu Jorge) has the drugs, Leny Drake (Joseph Fiennes) has the hands and cunning. In order to keep his escape plans secret he must overcomes the wiles of the prison inmate leader Rizza (Damian Lewis) whose sicko brother Tony (Steven Mackintosh) causes problems, including the physical abuse of a very young newcomer inmate Lacey (Dominic Cooper) whose loathing for Tony's endless advances drives him to the point of causing a major glitch in Frank's plan. But the escape plan proceeds and the film is a back and forth play between the planning and the actual process of the escape. Little is said in words in this film: most of the action comes for the faces and eye to eye encounters that drive the relentless attempt to escape to conclusion. And the ending will surprise every viewer, so cleverly has this story been prepared and told.

The acting is exceptional and the tenor of the film is greatly enhanced by the suspenseful cinematography by Philipp Blaubach. Benjamin Wallfisch provides some haunting, almost a cappella songs that heighten the intensity of the drama by commenting on it, and in other portions his musical score is the sort that maximizes the emotional aspect of the film rather than drawing attention to the music itself. This is far more than just another prison break film. This is a polished psychological thriller that deserves wide attention. Now, where is the DVD on Amazon.com? Surely it will appear soon.

3484316,5,B001B4PLZS,"PLOT SPOILER ALERT! The Escapist is now offered for free to Prime members, which sometimes may (or may not) indicate the end of profitable sales, but I found it to be realistic, engaging and well worth the close attention the murky and sometimes idiomatic dialog requires. However, I have yet to see any mention of the plot device being borrowed from Ambrose Bierce's short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. That's not entirely surprising for something published in 1890 by an author relegated to the back shelves of dusty brick-and-mortar libraries, but a French film version was broadcast as an episode of The Twilight Zone in the 60s, which makes it doubly memorable to those of a certain age. However, whereas Bierce used an innovative - for the time period - non-sequential storyline, the producers of The Escapist use a parallel storyline, then tie it all together at the end with references to prior key sequences. I especially liked the scene of the prisoner returning for his own cap to show that reality differed from the imagined version. The title of the movie also took on a different meaning with the unexpected conclusion, and it turned out to be one of those films that I keep thinking about. Would'a paid for this one!",1324684800,,1243,4.813084112149533
3484317,4,B001B4PLZS,"This is a British/Irish co-production with the Brits providing the prison and the Irish providing the most likeable prisoners.

3484318,4,B001B4PLZS,"I like rubber reality movies. They give me something to wrap my head around and, when done well, offer up some great surprises. I also like prison escape movies and film history is replete with some great ones. Here the two are joined with some really nifty results.

Here's the scoop. Brian Cox is in prison. An old nasty prison at that. He gets word that his daughter has become a junkie. She's had two heart attacks and won't survive a third. He needs to escape and try to save her. He hooks up with a few of his prison mates and concocts an escape plan. So, of course, the question becomes: Will the plan work?

This is a way cool movie. They cross cut between the escape itself and various events leading up to it. Truth be told, the cross cutting and the heavy British accents left me a bit confused at times, but pretty much everything got straightened out by the end. The prison scenes depicted many of the same things seen in similar movies. Bad guys and really bad guys who will kill you if you step out of line. Prison guards who look the other way when bad stuff happens. Homosexuality and guys who procure stuff that isn't supposed to be inside a prison. These things aren't new but they're done very well here. The escape itself is good. It's clever but not sensational, so you believe it. The punchline blew me away. It made me want to see the movie again to see what hints they might have provided to lead up to the big surprise.

Brian Cox is his usual good self. Damian Lewis is great as an effeminate, brutal inmate who is pretty much the king of the hill. Joe Feinnes does a standup job as do all the other players. The production values are good but this is just an outstanding movie overall. It moves like a freight train with nary a dull moment. For my dollar it was more than worth the time I invested to watch it.",1320278400,4,1838,4.29106628242075
3484319,5,B001B4PLZS,This is a fantastic debut feature film from the director of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Very intense and great performances.,1314316800,2,128,4.608695652173913
3484320,5,B001B4PLZS,"Prison break films are a staple of Hollywood and even TV nowadays. They go back to the earliest years of the talkie period with films like ""Big House"" (1931) and ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932). Personally I like ""The Great Escape"" as my favorite prison break film.

But this brilliant film may be my new favorite prison break film. Beware; you may not feel that way as you watch the film. It seems choppy, badly edited. The music seems clumsy, intrusive. The plot seems to wander and leave all sorts of holes. But stay with it. Everything will change and in the end you will have experienced a truly brilliant film.

The current film takes place in the U.K. and stars Brian Cox as a veteran criminal who wants to escape when he learns that his daughter is in danger, and puts together a team. Grizzled Brian Cox (1946) is a marvelous character actor who's given us great performances in films like ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004), ""Adaptation"" (2002), ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""Manhunter"" (1986). He won an Emmy and a Golden Globe in 2000 for ""Nuremberg"" and was nominated in 1993 for an episode of ""Frasier"".

Cox's team consists of Joseph Fiennes, Liam Cunningham, Seu Jorge, and Dominic Cooper. Fiennes (1970) is best known for his performance as the Bard in ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998) for which he was nominated for a BAFTA. Cunningham (1961) won an Irish Oscar for his roles in Hunger (2008) and ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" (2006)

Elsewhere in the prison are Damian Lewis as the head honcho and Steven Mackintosh as his psychopathic and brutal brother.

Lewis (1971) is best known from the quirky TV series ""Life"" (2007-9), as Soames Forsythe in ""The Forsythe Saga"" (2002-3), and as Maj. Winters from ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), for which he won a Golden Globe. His performance is electrifying and he steals every scene in which he appears, which is a considerable task considering his fellow cast members.

FWIW - Lewis and Fiennes went to acting school together.

This was the biggest project for writer/director Rupert Wyatt who went on to direct ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011).

The Village Voice called it ""a taut thriller that ends on a note of unexpected grace"" and MSNBC called it ""a nail biter"". The Chicago Tribune said ""First time feature director...knocks it out of the park.""",1310256000,,2319,4.73697270471464
3484321,4,B001B4PLZS,"THE ESCAPIST is not the kind of film I'm usually drawn to. The story of a lifer convict who learns his daughter is dying, and decides to organize a prison break so he can see her one last time, would normally not entice me. I watched the film to see Brian Cox and Liam Cunningham act -- and was surprised to find myself completely immersed in the story.

Primary focus is on the characters, secondary focus is on the planning and execution of the prison break. Switching back and forth between exploration of character and action was extremely effective. Fine acting all around (Cox and Cunningham are rock solid; Damian Lewis and Dominic Cooper, Steven Mackintosh are powerfully creepy and/or compelling).

I'll probably be in the minority, but I don't believe the modern need to provide a ""twist"" ending is always the way to go. This film depends on the twist, and it works without cheating, so I won't complain too much -- but as a viewer or reader I usually feel manipulated afterwards, and that affects my eventual feeling for how good the source material is. With this in mind, I could only give the film 4 stars.

I'd highly recommend The Escapist, and will watch for further efforts from Daniel Hardy and Rupert Wyatt.",1306972800,,1226,4.666666666666667

One of the other reviewers is correct:  this movie rates right up there with other great prison break-out movies: Shawshank, Alcatraz.  All of the actors, and in particular Brian Cox, give excellent performances.  The movie is gritty and beautifully filmed and the ending is heartbreaking.  I'm surprised that this movie did not receive greater distribution when it was released.  This is a must-see.",1300838400,,515,5.071428571428571
3484323,5,B001B4PLZS,"I was thumbing through the other reviews they pretty much covered everything, someone mentioned it was a bit slow, I didn't feel it was slow.  If anything the movie is really well designed story, the editing, the music and character development; superb, second to none.  kinda comparable to alcatraz but far better, much more gritty.  held my intrest the whole way through.

I love the way the story takes place in the present but as they break through different barriers during the break out, the movie switchs to flashbacks to show the recruitment and planning of that part of the break out.  so you really have to pay attention.  you get to know and love the characters in the movie.  some don't make it out and this is the sad part part of the movie.  The ending is very touching, especially if you have a daughter.  There is a unique twist that happens in the middle of the movie (not the end) and it changes everything.

3484326,5,B001B4PLZS,"""The Escapist"" is a thriller about Frank Perry (Brian Cox), a tough lifer determined to bust out of a London penitentiary to see his terminally ill daughter before she dies.  First, however, he'll have to assemble a hardcore crew, battle the brutal prison kingpin, and pull off a daring, suspenseful escape.  Director Rupert Wyatt cuts back and forth between the escape in progress and the days leading up to it.
 Prison films are not new, but ""The Escapist"" manages to make a familiar plot fresh thanks to well-written characterizations and a terrific performance by Brian Cox.  The success or failure of a prison escape flick depends on whether we care about the characters, and Cox, along with Joseph Fiennes, Liam Cunningham, Dominic Cooper, Steven Mackintosh, and Damian Lewis, provide solid portrayals.  The twist here is that the escape plot is motivated by a man longing to see his dying child one last time.  Also, the film contains a climactic secret that is unexpected and actually works.

3484327,4,B001B4PLZS,"4.2 stars

Rupert Wyatt scored big on this, his first feature film. He nails it as both writer and director; the characters are interesting and believable, the movie looks grimly gorgeous, and his time-shifting script pays off in the end in unexpected ways. He pulls fine performances from the entire cast, with Brian Cox leading the way. The music is also first-rate, always in tune with the director's intentions and often quite moving in its own right. It is in fact a very smart film in most every way; even the title takes on great resonance as the tale plays out.

I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of this here; it's a fine film, and maybe the best prison break movie since Shawshank. Give it time and I'm guessing The Escapist will become a true cult favorite, taking its deserved place just below such genre masterpieces as Papillon, Shawshank, and the Alcatraz films.",1263340800,8,883,4.764705882352941

I was lucky enough to catch The Escapist on Pay-per-view in a hotel room and I can report that it's really quite a story, wonderfully shot and acted with a surprise ending that doesn't feel like it cheats the audience and holds legitimate emotional power; if you like good films and can find The Escapist playing somewhere, by all means check it out.

8281937,5,B001B4PLZS,"For those who are disappointed not to see an overwhelming amount of guts, blood, gore and special effects, get over yourselves. For those who don't like this film because it's not an ""American style prison film,"" get a grip. This is a film that is set in the UK- films made there focus more on storytelling than on special effects.

The story in this film is riveting and amazing. Each character's reason for breaking out is different, yet they come together for the purpose. The ending is not what people think, and it's absoultely brilliant.

Making a cameo appearance is the Former World Heaavyweight Champion, Sheamus. He does demonstrate acting ability as an institutionalized thug in a bare-knuckle prison fight. His character, Two Ton, is used to guys staying down when he puts them down. When the man gets up, collecting his money isn't the point- his rep is at steak. Lose the rep and he could get a shiv in the ribs or spine.

8281942,4,B001B4PLZS,"In an Irish-UK crime thriller ""The Escapist"" Brian Cox plays Frank Perry, a convict for life, who gets his first letter in fourteen years. When Frank learns his estranged daughter is now a drug addict, he makes up his mind to break the prison with some of the inmates including his trusted friend Brodie (Liam Cunningham and a former thief Lenny Drake (Joseph Fiennes).

The premise of the prison break drama is rather simple; its narrative is not. Rupert Wyatt, who went on to direct ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" switches back and forth between two tmelines. It is not difficult to follow the story, though some may feel this kind of narrative structure is not necessary. Actually, it is necessary for the film's unique wrap-up to work. Without spoiling much, I can say it is an ambitious attempt, maybe too ambitious. The film achieves something original at the expense of dramatic development.

All actors did great jobs here. Damian Lewis and Steven Mackintosh are both terrific, and so is Dominic Cooper. It is nice to see the great character actor Brian Cox in the leading role (he was the first one to play Hannibal Lecter). He gives depth and believability to the character Frank. ""The Escapist"" is worth watching for his subtle and nuanced performance alone.",1335744000,2,1272,4.80365296803653
