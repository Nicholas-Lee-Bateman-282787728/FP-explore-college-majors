4643790,5,B005BIZ4NY,"I originally watched this movie on Netflix awhile ago and could not believe how uniquely funny and overall fun this movie was.  You won't really see anything new here, just their take on the same cliches, but the actors were really good, and the plot was really good and flowed well.

DEFINITELY worth a rental for upwards of $3.99 if you like college/high school humor, young love, and fun movies given any premise.  If you've ever seen ""The First Time"", this movie is kind of like that but funnier/lighter and overall more entertaining.",1374883200,,538,4.763440860215054
4643791,5,B005BIZ4NY,"Yes, Mr. Packard, there are many of us who recognize what you have done here. Seth Packard has created a wonderful little film, a film far superior to Napoleon Dynamite. It has what most big films don't have today: decent, likable characters. Packard has the confidence to show us rather than tell us and his sense of timing is superb. I hope that he can stay true to himself and keep making fun, decent films like this. I hope that Hollywood doesn't lure him to apply his great talent to produce more of their usual dreck. Kudos to Packard for rising above the level of most Hollywood films.",1345593600,2,592,4.4907407407407405
4643792,5,B005BIZ4NY,"Seth Packard is a genius.  This movie delivers so much fun and includes so many great scenes.  Napoleon Dynamite is a good movie, but Hottie Boomba Lottie is an EXCELLENT movie.  Packard and Lauren McKnight deliver astounding performances in this film about high school crushes and coming of age experiences.  I am so glad I happened to run across this movie and rent it.  I will be ordering it from Amazon after this review.

If you enjoy movies that take you places you're not expecting, deliver strange leading characters, and keeps the plot interesting from the opening credits, then Hottie Boomba Lottie is the movie for you!  Buy it today, and help support this young and energetic film-maker with a bright future!

See ya next review!",1326499200,3,741,4.825396825396825
4643793,4,B005BIZ4NY,"I picked this DVD up on a whim from the ""new movies"" section at my local library, and was not disappointed. The theme of unrequited teenage love has been well-mined in the movies, but gets a fresh, albeit low-budget, look here. Not everything works -- the scene where one of the characters brings a gun to school was more cringe-inducing than funny -- but enough does work that I found myself smiling over it for several days afterwards. The winsome Cleo (played by Lauren McKnight) pretty much steals the show, and the movie ends on just the right note.",1325721600,2,554,4.606060606060606
4643794,4,B005BIZ4NY,"I think that realistically, this film is a lot deeper than first meets the eye and maybe you have to take a step back and think about it for a bit to truly appreciate all that is has to offer. I didn't find any of the characters to be shallow - instead I saw a world through the main character of Ethan. Ethan's actions, which are often quirky and awkward, simply show the need to feel accepted but not knowing quite how to approach it. This film is his journey to self-discovery. Over the course of the film, he realizes that others don't have to dictate his boundaries or happiness. As Asher puts it, ""Just do whatever you want."" Madison, the love interest, who is cold and aloof, has her own set of issues. She's just trying to fit in as well - and chooses to do so by capitalizing on her good looks. And Cleo sees past Ethan's quirkiness from the beginning and patiently waits as his true ""him"" emerges. Thinking back on my high school experience, I can actually pinpoint each one of these characters (myself among them). It actually makes me think about my life and wonder if I have truly become the real me or am I still trying to put on a show for everyone else. Overall, I think the message is very strong, but it does take some thought to extract it.",1320624000,3,1259,4.294117647058823
4643795,5,B005BIZ4NY,This movie is exactly what it sets out to be. It's an awkward kid setting out to do awkward things in an awkward way. The timing is great on this show and it has surprisingly good cinematography for how unknown these people are. I thought they did great work and it's worth getting.,1320624000,2,282,4.339622641509434
4643796,1,B005BIZ4NY,"There are a lot of bad teen movies, and this arguably one of the worst I've seen.  I expected that an independent, small-budget film like this would bring a fresh perspective, but...no.

I'm accustomed to a lot of the cliches used in teen movies: absent or dysfunctional parents, teenage crushes, sexual hijinks, shallow characters who are redeemed by showing some previously unexplored goodness or depth, but this film isn't good for anyone. There isn't a single functional relationship, or good role-model.  The protagonist is not only unsympathetic, his obsession with his ""crush"" is unhealthy and he needed professional help. It wasn't cute and funny---that girl needed a restraining order to keep him away. The leading male characters are all self-absorbed and manipulative. The female characters are all weak and are only important in how they relate to the male characters. Really, the female characters in this movie make me cringe: Madison, the love object is just that--an object, she has no character development and is only given value for being attractive, and the other female character, Cleo, exists solely to adore Ethan (for NO reason I can surmise) and bring him out of his obsession/depression.  Cleo is the closest thing to a likable human being in this film, but I know absolutely nothing about her other than that she has an inexplicable, unrequited love for Ethan.  The sexuality in the film is low-key, but sinister: watching other people make out is creepy, kissing a girl without her consent (particularly when she is sleeping) amounts to mild sexual assault, breaking into Madison's room and filming her is a criminal invasion of her privacy,and it is NOT made okay by the discovery of her infidelity.  In the end the protagonist experiences no spiritual growth, no introspection.  His outright stalking of Madison is never shown as being wrong, and is only brought to an end by his decision that she is unworthy.  It is only then that his eyes are opened to the girl who thinks she loves him--somehow I didn't feel like cheering.

At the time I write this, Hottie Boomba Lottie is being circulated in the high-volume video rental machines.  I think you could find funnier, healthier fare from any other teen movie produced by any major movie studio. I would much rather have my teenagers see a more overtly sexual commercial film in which young women are active participants rather than objectified and made passive in this manner.",1320364800,,2459,5.004901960784314

8464013,5,B005BIZ4NY,"A very underrated movie.  Better than Napoleon Dynamite in my opinion. Should have been a bigger movie and shown nationally!  Great and quirky Indie film I love watching again and again.  Seth Packard did a phenomenal job as writer, director and star of this movie.  And remember, 'We're all cousins!' ",1454457600,,302,4.96

8464017,5,B005BIZ4NY,"I would strongly recommend this movie to any fans of Napoleon Dynamite. Any hopeless romantics will identify with the male lead character, Ethan (Seth Packard), who also writes, produces, and directs this film. An overall great independent comedy with an awesome soundtrack to match! I thoroughly enjoyed it!",1380672000,,308,5.4375
8464018,5,B005BIZ4NY,"My wife and I watched ""HottieBoombaLottie"" on a Friday evening on a whim several weeks ago, not having any idea what to expect. Although by no means deep, it's a charming coming-of-age movie about a teenage boy who is obsessed with the hottest girl in his class, going so far as to carry around a life-sized cardboard cut-out of her. Meanwhile, the girl won''t give him the time of day, but winds up going after his older brother. Then, while spending the summer in California with his cousins, he meets a girl who is a cousin to his cousins, but who is not blood related to him. She is clearly enamored of him, but he remains obsessed with the hot girl back home.

This brief description of the first part of the movie may make it sound as though this is a trite, shallow film. Yet, despite its lack of profundity and its predictable ending, the acting is so superb and the story is so charming and uplifting that it makes for a wonderful 80 minutes of entertainment.",1376006400,3,968,4.438202247191011
