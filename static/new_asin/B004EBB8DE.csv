4336145,4,B004EBB8DE,"I've seen this film on cable.
It's a very rare classic.
That's never been available in HD.
Bt any means.
I'm very disapointed in Universal pictures.
For mostly egnoring this great film.
The least they could do is make the amazon instant video available in HD as well",1358035200,,266,4.5625

4336147,4,B004EBB8DE,"Walk Proud, as a movie in its time, was average but, as a time piece it's a fun trip down memory lane. You have Robby Benson, at the height of his popularity, and the beautiful Sarah Holcomb who is worth viewing if only to glimpse an actress on the rise who soon, due to mental and chemical challenges, disappeared altogether. It is a swan song for both actors in a way. In a few years Benson's career as the young hot actor will have ended and Holcomb's really ended before it was supposedly destined to take off. These interesting artifacts are why you should see this movie, not for the story itself.

It is written by a veteran screenwriter and suffers due to the silly and cliched stereotypes portrayed, specifically Chicano's, Latino gangs, and youth in general. There are some somewhat realistic scenes of gang ethos, peer pressure, and related gang goings on but it's done with a palpable haze of naivete that is unsettling 30 years later. At the time it was made, in 1979, it was probably considered just not very good film making.

Still, Benson is watchable as the conflicted Chicano high schooler/gang member. He exudes a charm and innocence in that way that made him a kind of niche star in the late Seventies. And, if you get to know the background of Holcomb and what became of her, it is arresting to see her here in all her glory of teen aged beauty, promise, and the natural acting talent that would have taken her to stardom. Viewed with these lenses it is worth catching a glimpse of Walk Proud.",1347926400,11,1515,4.525547445255475

4336163,4,B004EBB8DE,"I remember watching this movie, for the first time, on HBO back in 1985.  It is a solid film in which Robby Benson was fantastic, but so was the late Trinidad Silva (a great actor who left us way too soon).  I did not give this movie a 5-star rating because of the poor quality of the video transfer.",1391817600,4,300,4.067796610169491
