8326809,4,B001NFNRWO,A very good summary of the life in Plum Village. Good introduction to the practice and I felt the peace from watching it. Enjoyed,1503014400,,129,4.416666666666667
8326810,5,B001NFNRWO,"Saw ONE WEEK recently (a silent) and became an instant fan of Buster Keaton.  What an amazing talent the guy had!  The stunts are marvelous, the story line funny, the actors great.  A house gets constructed as only Buster Keaton could do it in the most haphazardly way.  Perfect gift for our contractor, who did a great job in our home remodel, but surely in his nightmares, worries about houses like this one. For out-loud laughs and a chance to see a great gymnast/comedian/genius at work, check this short movie out!",1361491200,,519,4.670329670329671
8326811,5,B001NFNRWO,The best Keaton short comedy ever made - certainly one of the best silent comedies ever!,1281225600,,88,4.5625
8326812,4,B001NFNRWO,"The product data and editorial on this page are rather skewed.

While ONE WEEK is certainly a fine two-reeler, it does NOT run 79 minutes! This short clocks in at 19 minutes. Also, Eddie Kline does partially direct, but he is not in the main cast, as indicated above. Finally, this is NOT on any ""100 Greatest Movie"" lists. Perhaps the editorial is referring to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GENERAL/dp/B001E18222/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GENERAL</a>&nbsp;(1927)?

A bit of history--
When Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle voluntarily left his Comique Studio for PARAMOUNT and a multi-feature deal, producer Joe Schenck renamed Comique 'Buster Keaton Studio.' Although ""One Week"" was his first release, it was actually Keaton's second completed short.

This fast-moving comedy has newly-married Buster assembling a pre-fab house from boxes that have all been maliciously misnumbered by his bride's ex-boyfriend. The result is a misshapen disaster with not a straight line to be seen anywhere. A door hangs where a second floor window should be, the kitchen sink is on an outside wall, and so on.

Despite their home's bizarre appearance, the young couple invite dinner guests; when a windstorm hits, things get pretty crazy. The film's famous closing sequence has Keaton hauling the house to a new site and it gets stuck on a train track.

This short plus many more are available at a bargain price on ST. CLAIR's 3 disc set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEST-OF-BUSTER-KEATON/dp/B0015U0QQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEST OF BUSTER KEATON</a>. Also includes ""The General,"" several talking pictures and some extras.
