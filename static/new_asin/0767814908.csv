18140,5,0767814908,"I first saw this film when it originally aired on TV. I enjoyed the film so I purchased it. I love mountain climbing and wish I could do more of it. Films like this remind me just how dangerous the sport can be.
Overall, it you're into outdoors or climbing and want to learn from other's mistakes without making your own, this is a film to watch. What happens when arrogance replaces common sense? What happens when you don't obey your own rules?",1469232000,,446,4.385542168674699

18165,4,0767814908,"I've read all the books on Everest's 1996 season (and many others) so I've read about this expedition from all the POVs who've written their recollections, and seen all the documentaries.  So I had to see this too.

Like many movies made of real events, it takes some real liberties with the truth, and to make it a better ""story"", consolidates and leaves out people and stories.  Given events where so many people died, though, misrepresenting events to make a better story is well, disrespectful. In addition, Krakauer is made more central to the action -- the Sherpa leaders are shown appealing to him on various things, and he's mentioned as being involved in the rescues, when in fact, Krakauer was only a client, not involved in decision making, Sherpa leading, or rescuing. (A really embarrassing scene is when a Sherpa begs Krakauer to stop so they can rest).  Not that Krakauer didn't perform well on the mountain, being one of the first to summit, but no way would he have a Sherpa begging him to stop so they could rest.

Boukreev who was Fischer's lead guide, is shown in a fairly unflattering light.  There's of course controversy on this. If you read the survivors accounts, certain of Boukreev's clients said they didn't want to be alone on the mountain with him, because they felt he wasn't responsive to their needs. Of course, Boukreev had a different perception of a guides duties.  But when he was heading down the mountain he blew past clients that could have used his help, and as for his activities during client's acclimatization, Fischer was reported to have bitterly complained to his business manager that Boukreev was not attending to clients. So while the movie over-dramatizes that conflict, there really was some basis for it.  And it also reportedly left Fischer overly stressed and overworked, which perhaps left him underacclimatized and contributed to the edema that killed him.  On the other hand, even if too little too late, after the clients failed to return, Boukreev went out and saved many lives.  Still, I think the script was overly hard on him.

As far as accuracy on climbing details, there were some irritations - climbers not wearing goggles at times (when even a few minutes exposure could result in snow blindness) or gloves.  Of course an actor covered in mask and goggles can be hard to discern one from the other.  And don't think you'll see the Himalaya here,  this was filmed in the alps. The long acclimatization climbs are more or less skipped over.

OTOH, things like the logjam on the Step, the suddenness of the storm, the effects of running out of oxygen on climbers, are done well.  It's only once the storm hits that things go far off accuracy again, with the Krakauer being involved in the rescues and coordination more than he was.

So basically, if you watch this the first time, you might really find objectionable that it deviates in some respects from actual occurrences. and draws some characters and events with a too broad and thus somewhat inaccurate brush..  But it actually isn't too bad a movie, when you realize that all movies of true events deviate somewhat from the truth to tell a story. And while this has some deviations from reality that seem excessive at first, actually it really isn't too far off the mark, or too bad a movie.",1429660800,3,3313,4.7622377622377625
18166,4,0767814908,Very good for being a made for TV movie. You should definitely read Jon Krakauer's book first before seeing movie.

18179,2,0767814908,"Based on the infamous events of the 1996 season, this made for tv show isn't compelling. Mostly that's because it's cheap and it shouldn't have been. The story is interesting, but the main problem is that it just doesn't ever feel like they're actually climbing a mountain. It's like the screenwriters tried to write a movie about climbing Everest without bothering to research what climbing Everest is actually like. Even I could have done a better job.

18190,4,0767814908,"I would strongly suggest reading the book before seeing this movie.  The technical details of climbing Everest are many.  A movie cannot cover how this tragedy was caused by a series of circumstances, each contributing to the final outcome.  There was a lot of fallout in the years after this horrible event.  Perhaps the movie would have been better using a series of flashbacks from the fallout.  But I think the movie simply focused on the climb itself, and it stayed true to the actual events that ensued.  I enjoyed it, having read Jon Kakauer's book of the same title.",1316563200,,574,4.69

18192,1,0767814908,"I cannot imagine anyone who was actually involved in the 1996 Everest tragedy being at all pleased with this made for television movie.  Although Kraukaer's book of the same name seemed to show some biases and quick, sometimes scathing one sided judgements of people, no one can say that he is not an excellent and captivating writer.  In this movie, the poor script itself, would (or should) make him cringe.  There is little basis for fact in the movie as well:  Kraukaer was not the first to summit, he did not man the radio from camp once down to talk to Rob Hall...etc, etc, etc.  I wanted to watch the movie because I had read in Anatoli Boukreev's book The Climb how disturbed Boukveev was when he saw the movie on TV the night it was first played.  I am sorry that he had to suffer with this....and that he thought that this was how Americans would ""see"" the tragedy.  Well read (or simply thinking!) individuals would know that this was television at its worst.  What a vast waste of time and money. It has little basis in reality and I certainly did not find it entertaining.",1300147200,2,1085,4.472081218274112
18193,1,0767814908,"Read the book.  I agree with the negative aspects of some of the reviewers, such as, given how this film was made, I could not really care about what happened to most of the people, although there were a few positive aspects of the making this film.  For example, the dialogue, when I could hear it, was spare, even terse, no nonsense, which seems to fit the strenuous physical (and mental) exertion of the climb up and the descent---no time, energy, thought for hyperbole.

The most annoying thing about the film, for me however, was the music, which was so loud---and I fear uninteresting, uninspired---that often I could not hear what anyone was saying.  I had to sit up close and listen carefully to hear what the actors were saying.  The point is that the musical score itself was not a good enough reason to watch this film to the bitter end.  I was happy that I had read the book first.  So, again I say, read the book.",1296345600,4,926,4.443786982248521

Clothing and gear is wrong. Sequence of events and factual reconstruction isn't even close.  At one point they have Krakuer striking out in a blizzard on the South Col to rescue stranded climbers, only to have a sherpa beg him to abandon his efforts.  The facts show and even by Krakuers own admission he was sleeping in his tent and refused any participation in rescue efforts.

A quickly-put-together and unconvincing version of Krakauer's amazing book, Into Thin Air (and other movies like it, obviously) is the reason why ""TV movie"" is a pejorative term; rewriting real people to make heroes and villains and condensing everything into a tidy 100 minute block, Into Thin Air is depressingly bad.",1233792000,,337,5.2407407407407405

The film takes a full-frontal no-nonsense approach to the expedition, while the book bears a similarly terse attack on both the blatant and subtle errors in judgement and performance that would lead to death on everest.

I have seen it three times now, and have read the book upon which it is based, and others. I appreciate that the film may be a partial view, based as it is on one man's account, and I agree that at times it can be confusing, but the story and action are so strong that they carry you through.

It's funny to watch McDonald play Krakauer, as he's always the villain in so many B-movies. He does a good job as the author here, but the biases of the book are repeated and there are some overly sharp portraits drawn, especially of Fischer, who comes off as more of a jerk than in the book.

This awful made-for-TV movie isn't one of them.  I ordered it out of curiosity because I had read how bad it was, and it did not disappoint!

Very loosely based on Jon Krakauer's excellent book about his experiences as a member of Rob Hall's 1996 Everest expedition, this ""movie"" is poorly-acted, excruciatingly badly written, and has the most melodramatic musical score in the history of movie-making (the awful music swells alarmingly to announce each commercial break!)

It's also inaccurate, and is really an insult to the memories of some of the real-life participants in the tragedy.

It would be a shame if this TV garbage were your only introduction to, for example, Anatoly Boukreev (in the film the actors can't even pronounce his name right), who single-handedly kept the death toll during this awful night on Everest from being even worse than it was.

I had read that Jon Krakauer was always embarrassed about this movie, and I don't blame him.  So save your money, your brain, and your sensibilities, and read or re-read ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Climb"", ""Left for Dead"", or any of the other books by the participants in the 1996 Everest tragedy.

18254,3,0767814908,"Having read Jon Krakauer's Everest memoir, Into Thin Air, I decided to get the DVD of the movie.  The movie version of Jon's book isn't bad, but I think it falls just a little short of Jon's written account of his climb up Everest in '96.

In the movie, Christopher McDonald plays Jon; Nat Parker plays Rob Hall, the leader of Jon's Everest climb; and Peter Horton plays Scott Fischer, the leader of a rival group of climbers.  As in the book, the movie details how a lack of oxygen, small mistakes, and Rob and Scott's eagerness to get to the top--and pressing on despite storms brewing near Everest's summit--combined to cause the disaster.  Among the mistakes laid out in the movie were Scott's Sherpa guide Lopsang towing climber Sandy Pittman by rope even though he hadn't been instructed to do so and Jon's fellow climber Andy Harris accidentally turning up the regulator on Jon's oxygen tank full blast while suffering forgetfulness brought on by a lack of oxygen.  Also, Rob disregarded his own turnaround time of 2:00 p.m., which everybody on his team had agreed to so that they'd have time to get back down safely even if not all of them reached the top of Everest by that time.  Indeed, as depicted in the book and the movie, Jon and his guide Mike Groom were the only two people from Jon's expedition who reached the summit and then got off Everest alive.  However, the movie also includes the inspiring story of Jon's colleague Beck Weathers, who, despite nearly dying from frostbite, walked into camp one day after everyone had given up on him and eventually recovered.  Beck, as the ending shows, lost his right hand and all the fingers on his left hand and underwent the reconstruction of his nose, but he still was able to return to his work as a doctor.  The most memorable scenes are Beck's near-death experience and miraculous recovery; the scene where Jon ran out and banged on pots and pans to guide the climbers who had gotten lost after the disastrous storm on Everest; Rob's dying phone conversation with his wife, Jan, who was pregnant and was talking to him from New Zealand; and the closing scene, the memorial service at Everest Base Camp for the climbers who perished on the mountain.  The scenery is majestic, and I got a sense of the climbers' desperation as they struggled just to survive on Everest.

However, the movie version of Into Thin Air, in my opinion, doesn't do the book justice.  For one thing, the movie was mainly concerned with what happened on Everest and not how the characters got there.  To be sure, it's hard to get all the details of a book into a 90-minute to two-hour movie.  However, in the movie version of Into Thin Air, we don't really get to know the characters personally.  There's just a brief exposition before the climbing scenes commence.  This is unfortunate because in reality, once they got into Nepal, Jon and his fellow climbers spent quite a while on the trail on the way to Base Camp.  Also, Jon and his colleagues, once they got to Base Camp, spent three weeks there before making their summit bid, using that time to make several forays above Base Camp in order to get fully acclimated. A lot of the characters aren't really well-developed either.  In my opinion, Rob, Nat Parker's character, is more interesting than Jon(as played by Christopher McDonald) or Scott(as Peter Horton portrays him).  Rob's New Zealand humor provides occasional comic relief for an otherwise dull--and eventually tragic--situation.  Also, since we hear Rob talking to his wife on the phone just before he dies, we get a sense of how much he loved his family.  We don't hear Jon conversing with his wife back in the United States, even though in the book, he and Linda had phone conversations on numerous occasions--and Jon, in the book, is the protagonist and author!  I think, too, that the movie understates Jon's emotional reactions to what happened.  In the book, Jon was overcome with grief and guilt at the loss of his friends.  In the movie he's portrayed as a self-absorbed guy who went up the mountain because of personal ambition--and when his friends(Andy, Rob, Scott, Doug Hansen, and Yasuko Namba) start dying, we don't see him exhibit any anguish.  Indeed, in the movie, Jon cracks up only twice:  the first time when he is standing over Rob's frozen body, and again at the very end, when he talks about his dead friends at the Base Camp memorial service.  The movie's portrayal of Jon, in my opinion, is demeaning.  In the book Jon wanted to get up Everest very badly--almost at the exclusion of anything else--but he still grieved for his friends.  Furthermore, I think that in at least one place in the movie, there's some obvious stretching of the truth.  The scene where I most doubt the credibility of director Robert Markowitz and writer Robert Avrech is the scene where Jon, having failed to rescue Rob, discovers the latter's frozen body.  In the written account, Jon did not try to go after Rob because he(Jon) was shivering in his tent and concerned with his own survival.  Anatoli Boukreev, a guide on Scott's team, was the one who coordinated most of the rescue attempts on the mountain.  Rob's body was actually found some time later by climbers Ed Viesturs and David Breashears as they were making their way to the top of Everest.  Also, I think the filmmakers' portrayal of Anatoli, one of the heroes of the expedition, is off base, although the movie truthfully recounts his heroism in the wake of the storm.  Anatoli, as Jon wrote, was a dedicated guide who helped find several of the climbers who were lost, even though he had to descend ahead of his teammates because his rescue attempts used up a lot of his oxygen.  Markowitz and Avrech portray Anatoli as a ""he-man"" type--boorish, uncooperative, and sometimes argumentative.  In one scene, Anatoli and Scott get into a heated fight over Anatoli's responsibilities as a guide.  Although Anatoli got criticized for the way he did his job and for descending ahead of his team after the storm, I didn't see any open hostility between him and Scott when I read the book.  Another discrepancy between the book and the movie is that in the book, Rob didn't see the Taiwanese climber as the climber came out of his tent shod only in his boot liners and slid down the mountain to his death.  The Taiwanese group was on Everest at the same time as Rob's and Scott's teams but didn't go up the mountain at the same time.  Finally, the movie stops after the memorial service and doesn't include Jon's adjusting to life back in the United States.  I concede that the movie is an abridged version of Jon's book.  However, in real life, Jon had to deal not only with missing his dead friends and getting used to being at home again but with the hate mail he received after writing the magazine article which was the impetus for his book.  As Jon wrote, the hatred coming from the pens of his critics made the aftermath of his Everest climb even harder to deal with than it already was.  Markowitz and Avrech completely overlooked this part of Jon's story--and I think that the criticism Jon received, not just for the role he played in the deaths of his friends but for going up Everest in the first place, was a key element in his book.  Still, as an adventure story, the movie Into Thin Air is not great, but it's all right.  The movie, like the book, shows us how people react in a desperate situation and how even little things we do can have big consequences.",1118448000,23,7491,4.648710166919575
18255,3,0767814908,"The movie ""Into Thin Air"" is based on the John Krakauer publication about five or six climbers who died on Mt. Everest during a storm.  The film is not a great piece of cinema drama or even suspense.  The character development is a little shallow and the acting a tad weak.  I have not read the Krakauer book but my guess is that it is much better.  I imagine this might sound a tad mean but I was actually happy when a few people died (in the movie not real life) because they were being brash and annoying.

Still the film is entertaining because I think it captures the dangers of climbing when you do not follow through with the game plan and act like a total bafoon, which the film recreates.  I do not know if this was the real situation for the climbers.  It seems like some of the individuals climbing should not have been a part of the expedition on Everest.  If you want to know what not to do when climbing Everest, watch this film.  The ending was pretty lame, but of course if you have paid any attention to Hollywood in the last few years this movie is still better than a lot of worthless trash on the market.",1117497600,3,1124,4.214953271028038
18256,2,0767814908,"I don't know what should have tipped me off first -- that this film is made for TV or that the ""bonus trailers"" on the DVD are for ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Vertical Limit.""

A story as profound as Krakauer's and a mountain as big as Everest just shouldn't be forced onto the small screen.  The movie suffers greatly from the very things that mountainclimbers cannot do -- rush.  The movie pushes along at a relentless pace using fade to white as a time compression device.  The movie never takes its time until its way too late.  We can't decompress that fast!

The dialogue and acting suffer from the made-for-TV feel, and the plot comes across as something closer to one of Reader's Digests' ""Drama in Real Life"" instead of Krakauer's prose.  Sure there are a few emotional moments and points where they ""get it right,"" but they are too few and far between.  The movie is so rushed we don't have time to care about the characters presented.  Ironically I thought Imax's ""Everest,"" even with its documentary feel, was far more moving.

Of course I also did this movie a disservice by seeing it back to back with ""Touching the Void"" an immensely superior film.  Read Krakauer's book and watch ""Void"" or ""Everest.""  Leave this DVD back at base camp.

18257,1,0767814908,"There are two ways to approach this film.  The first is whether it is a fair and accurate rendition of the events of the 1996 tragedy which was the subject of Krakauer's book.  The second is simply what entertainment value the film has.  Having read both Krakauer's book and Boukreev's ""The Climb,"" this film's flagrant deviation from any semblance of reality so distracted me that I was unable to discern any entertainment value in the film whatsoever.

Things get started with a big fat lie.  We are informed at the very beginning that the film is based on published accounts and interviews of the participants.  This would lead the unsuspecting viewer to believe that the film makes an effort to be faithful to the truth.  I wonder how many people have watched this movie and think, as a result, that they know something about the tragedy, its causes, or even Everest and mountaineering for that matter.  They would be sadly mistaken on all accounts.

The film somberly announces each day of the expedition:  day one, day two, etc.  Each day finds the climbers of the two expeditions traveling as a group, reaching a new camp.  What a joke.  In reality, it takes weeks to establish the camps, while the climbers acclimatize to the altitude.  This is accomplished in small groups, not the entire expedition together.  If they had really climbed to camp IV in the four days depicted, they all would died of AMS before even being able to attempt the summit.

Hollywood being what it is, even a story about climbing Everest has to have some sex in it.  Sex American style, no less, meaning there can be no sex without moralizing.  We see Sandy Pittman's lover climb up to camp I to be with her, and a Sherpa voices strong disapproval because they're not married.  He foretells that the mountain will not tolerate such flaunting of its moral code, and he fears the worse.  This entire segment is a product of the screenwriter's imagination.  But now we know that the entire tragedy was the result of Ms. Pittman's unrestrained libido.

We don't have to wait for the tragedy proper to get a taste of the mountain's ability to have revenge.  In the next scene, a Taiwanese climber (although, there were no Taiwanese in the two groups, the screenwriter created these characters to play the role of buffoonish amateurs) walks out of his tent in his boot liners, slips on the ice and falls to his death.

I'm not going to catalog all the factual errors in the film here.  By this time you get the idea.  What happened is less important than what the screenwriter thinks would make good drama (and it's amazing how bad his idea of good drama is).

The most outrageous deviation from the truth comes during the unfolding of the tragedy itself.  As the situation deteriorates, the movie has Krakauer coordinating and leading rescue efforts, including going back onto the mountain in an effort to find Rob Hall.  In truth, Krakauer spent the night sleeping in his tent, too exhausted to move.  The only member of the two teams who made any rescue efforts at all after returning to Camp IV was Boukreev, who single handedly saved the lives of four climbers lost on the South Col.

Other reviewers have commented on other failings of the movie, and to those I will only add that it is extremely difficult to follow the movie at times, because it's hard to know who is who.  Characters are not introduced and most of them do not get enough camera face time to be recognized, especially all wrapped up in a snowsuit with fake snow and ice hanging off their faces.",1108857600,48,3548,4.645264847512038
18258,2,0767814908,"A few years ago I read the book this movie is based on and it started a fascination with the mountain and the people who sometimes die climbing it. I then discovered a movie, this movie, was made. It took some time to get a copy, and when I finally had opportunity to watch it with my girlfriend, I fell asleep (not really a comment about the movie, but the excessive hours I was working).
  So now, I've watched it. And... it was clearly in trouble right off the start. In a story ABOUT how several people died on the mountain, the movie often STOPs to remind us with the narration,  that '5 people will die'. The producers obviously recognized thier inability to recreate the actual drama that happened.  I say, ""Don't tell me, SHOW ME"". After several scenes I was left wondering if I hadn't read the book if I would really understand what was happening.

I found the film's toneto mimic  an almost journalistic manner much as Krakauer's book did.  I wanted to see if the film was true to the book and lo and behold it was!  This was a tragedy and the film portrayed it as such.  But it certainly wasn't a ""Hollywood"" film.  If it was then it would have concentrated on two central figures who seem to concoct a sexual romance amidst the tragedy; perhaps there should have been more concentration on the scene where two characters have sex in a tent and one of them slaps a steamy hand on the tent walls....a la ""Titanic"".  Perhaps if his film was made more like ""Titanic"" complete with Celine Dion love song then it would have gotten better reviews.  Take the film for what it is.  Read the book.

I think it's utterly selfish and short-sighted to leave spouse and children so that you can haul yourself up a mountain as dangerous as Everest, which gives no quarter to the slightest mistake; irrespective of that, I found their fight for survival and their commitment to each other deeply moving.

I recently finished Krakauer's book, and the movie does it justice. It's just so emotional, so in-your-face, I was mesmorized by the journey, and devastated by the outcome. It's a terrific film.",1105660800,14,824,5.234848484848484

The brutal reality of such an endeavor is brought home in the hopelessness and grief that the crew endures and in the lost lives of five of its members.  I for one cannot understand anyone's reason for going on such a frightening expedition; some of the climbers weren't even experienced enough to climb ladders, let alone this monstrous peak.  Although the script doesn't flesh out the characters enough for us to truly empathize with their emotions, there is enough real drama in some of the characters to inspire such empathy.  Rob (played quite well by Nat Parker) is an interesting character and his final scene with his pregnant wife, is heartbreaking, and acted remarkably well.  Christopher McDonald doesn't bring enough real life to his Krakauer performance, hence we lose a lot of impact in his emotional narrative.

But, director Robert Markowitz wastes no time in plunging the viewer into the frightening story, and despite the danger, the mountains are photographed beautifully.

It's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"" may find it superficially enjoyable.  But why take the time to watch this when you can see a much better view of Everest around the very time this disaster happened by viewing the IMAX film (or its video) and live the experience through one of the two books.
David Breashears, one of the creators of the IMAX film has an excellent book that uses his experience with the climb and the film to study the '96 disaster.  This film takes a back seat to his book, too.

Although there is a fine movie about it (starring Michael Biehn and Matt Craven) I'm still waiting for a movie that can bring us the real shot to mountanier live:  extreme danger, 90 rock walls, deadly avalanches and many nature-against situations that put human lives in a thin line.

18278,2,0767814908,"The making of this movie was quite an undertaking. Unfortunately, it never quite makes the grade. The characters are not developed. Instead, they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.

One expedition leader, the late Scott Fischer, comes across as a mellow, disorganized, bumbling dude. One of his expedition guides, the late Anatoli Boukreev, is depicted as a self centered, Neanderthal like he-man, who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.

Another expedition leader, the late Rob Hall, fares somewhat better, in that he is portrayed as an organized, stand up expedition leader, who puts the welfare of his clients above his own. His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.

Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed, rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks. Texan Beck Weathers fares little better, as he is characterized as a buffoon. I am sure that, were he to see this movie, he would wish that they'd have left him on Everest.

The actor who plays Jon Krakauer's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus. He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie. He portrays Krakauer as a dour, humorless human being who, were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer, would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul. Last, but certainly not least, are the Sherpas, who are shown as wise, brave, put upon souls. Now here, the movie is hitting its mark.

The cinematography is laughable. Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest. Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume, waving banner like in the sky?

Let me cut to the chase. Read the well written book upon which the movie is based, ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer.

This is a great film for climbers and novice adventurers alike.",934848000,2,594,4.376146788990826
18282,3,0767814908,"OK, this isn't a great movie, but it's not as bad as some reviews here make it out to be.  Given the huge cast of characters on the mountain, you can't expect in-depth characterization of everybody!
I thought the  casting was excellent, and captured the essence of what each of the  participants was like (at least in the somewhat one-dimensional view that  Krakauer's book gives). A better movie could have been made about the  tragedy, with a different point of view from the book, but a film of  Krakauer's book (especially as a TV-movie quickie), isn't going to be Oscar  material... they did a competent job, and I enjoyed watching it.
Rent it.  Read the book (better, read a *great* book about mountaineering challenges  and tragedies, like Heinrich Harrer, The White Spider.)",928800000,10,782,4.863636363636363
18283,3,0767814908,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster (had a rent one, get one coupon) and was very anxious to see it.  If there ever was a book that should not have been attempted as a made-for-TV movie, this is it.  If Titanic deserves 3  1/2 hours, Into Thin Air deserves at least 2.  Too much had to be left out,  and the editing required for TV viewing caused it to lose some credibility.  See the IMAX film instead.",917740800,,404,4.181818181818182

The book is so much better but if I was to compare this movie to Everest which came out last year, this one wins. I like the actors, many you will recognize from the 1990's. This movie is a lot easier to follow than Everest and after having read many books on the subject, this one more closely follows the actual events.",1478908800,5,394,4.12987012987013

7789078,3,0767814908,"This is a very poorly written/acted movie. It jumps all over the place and is difficult to follow. The ""challenges"" presented to the climbers are incredibly unrealistic and the dramatic music score is just terrible.
It is clearly a made for TV movie but I didn't expect it to be quite so.... TV-ish. Its not horrible but its not that great either. It reminds me of the Airport movies if that makes sense. They took a disaster, in this case a real one, and instead of just telling the story, they tried to inject more drama in to it. This event of May 10th 1996 had enough drama, it didn't need the Hollywood coating.",1471651200,2,616,4.412280701754386
