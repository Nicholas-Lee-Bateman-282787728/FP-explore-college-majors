6112305,5,B00GTKYI1C,"The first two seasons of The Bridge, however filled with horror, were feats of writing and acting. The characters playing Saga and Martin make the show so watchable and lovely. Saga with her aggresive Asbergers was just an amazing actress and her relationship with Martin was the reason we kept watching here in my home. But for series 3 which we bought to watch after season 2, was SPOILER ALERTS Coming here:

Season three in its 10 episodes was so weak by comparison. Martin, who disappeared at the end of Season 2, jailed for 10 years so we understand in Season 3 is barely mentioned and never seen again. Maybe the actor died or had a dispute with the program but they never tried to let us see him not one single shot of the man. Saga and Henrick were a much different team and so many of the murder stories were not interesting. In addition, they  killed off Hans, recently married to another great character in the Swedish police force, leaving a psychotic woman as the commander. She treats Saga like a fool, which is anything but true, and ultimately gets rid of the main character. I think the writers did such a poor job with Season 3 as to ruin all that came before and I rue having wasted my time on this facilime of the real ""The Bridge"" which should have ended with Season 2. Have I conveyed how much those who created a great show lost during the truly awful Season 3. Do not buy it if you haven't already as it is a farce and really an insane finale to a previously great show. Shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1505347200,4,1523,4.435714285714286
6112306,5,B00GTKYI1C,"The Bridge is a Swedish/Danish murder mystery and thriller, created and written by Hans Rosenfeldt, and produced by Swedish Sveriges Television and Danish DR Television. In this second season, the story line begins with a small cargo ship which has mysteriously run aground in the shallow waters near the iconic Oresund Bridge, connecting Malmo, Sweden with Copenhagen Denmark. Inexplicably, this cargo ship had been abandoned, and had subsequently gone adrift, with no crew or staff found on board. The ensuing inquiry into the circumstances surrounding this highly unusual case triggers the reuniting of Swedish Detective Saga Noren and Danish Detective Martin Rohde, as they again join forces to collaborate in a complicated cross-bridge investigation of another perplexing conspiracy. As was the case in the first season of this fabulous series, the performances of the lead actors, Sofia Helin and Kim Bodnia, are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. The Bridge - Season 2 is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Bridge - Season 2 features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505347200,3,1373,5.511848341232228

6112326,4,B00GTKYI1C,Excellent series.  The leading actress was so enjoyable to watch and her partner was a good match for her.  We watched The Tunnel in September and this series was nearly identical to that DVD set.  Surprised they'd be allowed to nearly copy cat episode by episode but they did.  This one was very well done.,1481414400,,307,4.527272727272727
6112327,5,B00GTKYI1C,lots of fun  now and English version we tried but liked this one much more,1481328000,,74,3.933333333333333
6112328,2,B00GTKYI1C,"The series is excelent, both the First and Second seasons. However, one the discs of the second season DVD was defective and I could not watch the last two chapters. As I opened the package and watched it many months after I purchased it, I could not return it either. Who does quality control here?",1481068800,,299,4.454545454545454

6112330,5,B00GTKYI1C,"Took me a few episodes to get into it, but after that I was hooked.  Great story, one you only find in BBC min-series.  Well written and acted.  Saga, the female cop in the show really takes the show, with her very quirky personality.  Actually, I think they got the character for her from a popular Sci-Fi TV show in the States, Star Trek Voyager.  A character called SEVEN of NINE, acted in exactly the same manner.  You have to watch the character in that show to see what I mean, I think she was in seasons 5 - 7.  They even called Saga an automaton which is what they called Seven of Nine. lol",1480723200,,598,4.147826086956521

6112333,5,B00GTKYI1C,"We discovered this as a by-product of the Tunnel, an almost identical knock off with different actors/actresses and different location.  Same plot and storyline.  Both were good.  We preferred this one to the other.",1479686400,,215,5.264705882352941
6112334,5,B00GTKYI1C,The chemistry between the two detectives was great. After seeing this The Tunnel was a disappointment.  The acting was fantastic! I really liked the two detectives.,1479513600,,164,5.3076923076923075
6112335,5,B00GTKYI1C,i hope there is more coming this was a wonderful breath of fresh idea and interactions  some low spots but great acting and dialogue and twists,1477958400,,143,4.5
6112336,5,B00GTKYI1C,"This is dark and heavy and glorious. The storytelling and the film making are top notch, and the characters are spellbinding. One of my favorite series by far. I love Saga and Martin and how they grow and change as the story goes on.",1477785600,,233,4.318181818181818

6112339,4,B00GTKYI1C,"So far we have liked every version of The Bridge/The Tunnel that we have watched with the exception of the USA/Mexico version.  That's just our personal opinion.  Each version has just enough difference to keep it interesting.  Disclaimer:  we have not watched more than a few minutes of the USA/Mexico adaptation, before we decided not to continue.",1476489600,,349,5.0701754385964914
6112340,5,B00GTKYI1C,"This is the BEST story and acting I've seen in a long time.  My wife and I LOVED it!  Very well produced in two countries with great shots of local scenes.  Thrilling plot, great performances by lead actors, amazing personality differences, superb dialog for their strained interactions.",1476316800,,287,5.0638297872340425
6112341,5,B00GTKYI1C,"Much better than the English Language version.  The female detectives Autistic performance is tough and sweet at the same time, and gives needed relief to the dark plot lines.  Does the sun ever shine in Sweden?  Denmark?  Are all offices furnished in stark modern furniture?  Are all rich people psychotic?  Great show to binge watch, just open the blinds now and then.",1475539200,3,370,4.887096774193548

The female of the pair, a neuroatypical Swede who is comically unaware of social cues and obsessive about detail, is the Sherlock Holmes of the series.  Her male Danish partner, a more common detective type--the disheveled male with domestic troubles--alternates between puzzlement over his partner's odd ways and utter captivation.

I do admit that season 2 was initially a bit ""off beat"" from the outstanding and flawless flow of season 1, however after viewing the last few episodes (7, 8, 9,10), I was drawn right back into this series.  This is a WONDERFUL series !
 My ONLY complaint is that NOW this series really does seem to be over.  Completely enjoyed both season.  Just outstanding entertainment on every level.

6112396,5,B00GTKYI1C,"There have been two seasons made of this show. It is a Danish and Swedish coproduction. Also, one detective is Swedish and the other Danish because the body which is found is on the bridge between the two countries. Half the body is in one country and other half is in the other.

Both of these detectives have problems. She is an absolutely outstanding detective and gorgeous to boot BUT she has a disorder which is Asperger's or something similar. She does utterly bizarre things and her interpersonal relationships are beyond bizarre. She is also literal about everything.

He is a very good detective but has had a messy personal life for quite some time. He is now on a second marriage. He has children from both marriages. He has fooled around on the side. He's the kind of guy who likes getting married and having a family but he's not very good at doing it once that has occurred. In short, they are so dysfunctional individually that they work well as a team, especially since no one else wants to work with either of them.

I bought this Amazon Video thinking that it was the ENTIRE Season 2 but now find that Episode 2 is missing.  I'm hoping that this is just a glitch and Amazon will add the missing episode.

That said, I enjoyed Season 1 very much--good story, interesting characters, different location and laws make this a great variant from American police dramas.

6112412,5,B00GTKYI1C,"The resundsbron Bridge is eight kilometers long and brings Copenhagen, Denmark to the Swedish city of Malm. In the first season we met a killer who placed two halves of a severed body exactly on the border between Denmark and Sweden in the center of the Bridge, bringing together both police forces. We were introduced to Saga Norn, the police detective from Sweden, and Martin Rhode from Denmark.

The second series shows us a tanker which collides with the centre of the bridge. Saga Norn, played by Sofia Helin, the police detective from Malm, investigates. She discovers five bodies all found to have suffered from the plague. Because some of the dead people are from Denmark, she calls her old friend, Danish officer Martin Rohde, played by Kim Bodnia. As we discovered from series one, both of these characters have serious issues, however, these two characters and their relationship bring this series to life. Saga has a form of Asperger's syndrome. She has difficulty with socialization, has no filters, tells the truth without reading the effect it has upon others. Hence, she has difficulty with any relationship.  Martin, in series one, had brought a great deal of socialization into Saga's life, and he tried to educate her about relationships, but she has a tough road to follow. She is precise and always feels she must tell the truth, that is her job, and she is a top notch detective.

Martin is separated from his wife and five children after suffering PTSD after their last case. He is stressed, agitated, and is taking very big risks. Saga notices this, of course, and calls him on it.
Martin realizes that Saga is the only one to hold him accountable and she holds him to the truth. This he appreciates, everyone else holds him at arm's length.

In this second season Eco terrorism raises it's head, deadly bacteria are unleashed, and all hell breaks loose. New characters come and go, and from the first season, we realize that these new people fit in somehow to the bigger puzzle. There is brilliant writing and acting in both series. But, once again, it is the relationship of Saga and Martin that hold the show together. This has become one of my favorite shows exactly for that reason.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-30-15",1440892800,16,2249,4.816062176165803

6112425,5,B00GTKYI1C,"Season 2 of THE BRIDGE is as captivating as the first, with two lead performances that leave you wanting more and more. To that end, there will be a real disappointment for fans of the show as Season 3 goes into production, but no spoilers here! Instead, just sit back and enjoy another dark, compelling and thoroughly satisfying police procedural in the great tradition of recent Scandinavian hits like THE KILLING and WALLANDER.

Sofia Helin gets some big laughs as her socially inept Saga goes through another relationship and cannot understand why others view her behaviour as odd. And Kim Bodnia as Martin makes you forget the picture perfect American actors that portray the lead in virtually any North American police drama. Together they are a wonderful odd couple, a formula oft-used but employed here with a freshness that makes you forget you're watching anything the least bit formulaic.

The plot, concerning terrorism and biological warfare, is meaty enough to sustain another ten-part series. And there are enough twists and turns to keep you repeatedly on the edge of your seat.

If you like your detective shows edgy, gritty and don't mind reading subtitles, THE BRIDGE Season Two will be your cup of tea. Or should that be coffee? With a Danish, of course!",1433635200,,1274,4.94392523364486

6112432,3,B00GTKYI1C,"One ought to take a deep breath before lauding Season 2 as an extension of Season 1. The differences between the two in production values, story and narrative logic as well as acting methods are different in the two sessions and
not always satisfying for a  casual yet interested viewer.
  In Part 2 there is much psychodrama between all the key characters, often marginal and  irrelevant to the plot. The viewer may not want to know about the detailed hangups and social problems of marginal characters when the narrative is interrupted for various irrelevant confessions, some dialogue which makes up for lack of plot or final sequences involving ""coincidences"" which are not fully explained. The carefully crafted professional detectives of the first sessions turn out to be automatons and somewhat evil in themselves. There is also an ending that definitely completes the series.
After watching a few episodes at least one viewer is left wondering why the tensions and crisp script of the earlier hypnotic piece cannot be maintained;Furthermore  one needs to have seen the earlier  Bridge,Part 1,to make full sense of a number of events in the second season even as the story occasionally spills over as  a main character returns at various times as a
"" real"" or  ""dreamlike apparition.
The clues as to some motives or revelations as to""who did what"" in this second show are not revealed until the very last part of the last session. There is no second guessing for the viewer who has watched for over 5 hours and who must simply drift with the story line to the very end...that is, to  the very last 3 minutes of ten parts.

However, Season 2 is where the two series goes with different story lines. Again, the Danish/Swedish story line is MUCH better than the USA story. Saga is maddening and lovable at the same time.

6112452,4,B00GTKYI1C,"SPOILER ALERT

More than a year had passed since the events of The Bridges season one finale. Martin was a changed man following the murder of his teenage son, August, at the hands of the Truth Terrorist, his marriage had fallen apart and his hair had turned grey overnight. Saga, on the other hand, was exactly as Spock-like as ever: still faultlessly professional, still stripping down to her bra in the office, still puzzled by human social interaction.

When a ship veered off course and rammed into the now-familiar Oresund Bridge, Saga discovered five young people on board, drugged and chained up. She once again required the help of her Danish colleague, Detective Martin Rohde. But was the damaged and reckless Martin up to conducting a homicide investigation, so soon after tragedy? And was Saga up to providing the emotional support he needed?

Excellent characterization has always been the bedrock of this near-perfect series, so it was a relief to see that while the leads had been allowed to evolve, the delicate balance of their good cop/mad cop routine had been retained. Meanwhile, new story threads introduced us to an intriguingly ruthless teenage girl and a lonely teenage boy, and all of it was set against the beautifully muted color palette of Scandi suburbia.
