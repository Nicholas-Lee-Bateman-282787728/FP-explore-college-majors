The myth of the gunslinger has been around for centuries. In the beginning it wasn't the use of guns that made a man more dangerous than another but knives, swords, mallets and more. With the creation of firearms that changed. Add to that the tales of the old west and the gunslinger was born. Fables old and new arose from those days and they carry on to the present in movies we see released every year. They update those tales and sometimes work, others not. That decision is based on the viewer and their perspective.

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA is set in the world of illegal gun slinging in South America. Competitors face off with one another in an area designated by whoever is hosting their match. A circle is drawn for them to stand in, they put on their own Kevlar vests and face one another. At a signal from their host, they draw and attempt to push their competitor out of his circle unable to return. Shots are only at the vests and to draw blood is to lose the competition.

In this world walks John (Ryan Kwanten), a young man on a mission. Joh know that hes good, perhaps the best there is or ever will be. But until he meets up with the one man who has survived all challenges, a mysterious man known as Zorringer (Mickey Rourke) he will never know. But getting to Zorringer is easier said than done. To face off to Zorringer you have to be invited and hes not likely to take on just anyone. His girl Friday checks out all competitors and to date, John hasn't met the standards set. So he carries on, moving from one match to the next, earning his way to the top.

Into Johns life walks Colt (Freida Pinto), a young woman on her own quest. Colt is another contender in the game. A deadly drawn and accurate to boot, she takes on challengers as well. Her goal is to find the man who killed her brother playing these games. Whether she will kill him or not is yet to be seen. While watching John she becomes intrigued and the two partner up to travel the roads of South America from meet to meet hoping to resolve the issues they have. John and Colt eventually become lovers as well. With the amount of time spent together it is inevitable. The question is will their different paths unite to keep them on one or will they part ways down the road?

On their journey they pick up wounds, bruises and more. They encounter a couple of corrupt police officers and have to find a way out of that predicament without injury to anyone. Neither of them are murderers yet and have no intention of killing innocents. But while the law usually looks the other way in the competitions getting to them is another matter.

While the story of Colt must have a solution the showdown between John and Zorringer is what most matters in this story. John does finally win his shot at taking on the man known as the best there is. While meeting there is no animosity between the two and they have a metaphysical conversation concerning what it is they do. And then they meet on the field.

The movie does an even handed job of presenting the story and the competition for what it is, illegal gambling on a deadly sport. The intertwined stories of John and Colt work well together and their romance forms naturally in a world where the next day might be their last, especially when John is wounded with broken ribs from taking a few hits. It makes for an interesting film that holds you in its grip from start to finish. That being said it has one major flaw that arrives very late in the film that is a personal gripe with me but that I won't spoil for those who want to see this film.

The production value of the film is very good with some nice cinematography making things clear rather than going for an edgier look. The sound people have done an outstanding job here as well highlighting everything someone in deep concentration might be hearing throughout each confrontation. The acting is well done by all involved but Roarke is used so little here as to almost make his part a cameo undeserving of his name being used to promote the film.

The movie may not be for everyone but it will present something different to watch on a Friday night. Finding an original movie is rare and this one doesnt quite fit into any particular category making it more original than most. I guess you could call it a western set in a different location but on the whole its its own movie.",1445904000,5,4421,4.388278388278389

7282215,1,B00ZGPMBNI,What was I thinking here. The name of this should have said it all. Mickey Rourke fans; don't let this fool you. He is in the last 10 minutes of this thing. He always does the best he can but no one can do much with 10 minutes. Ughh! I'm sure there will be an audience for this. People who like the TV gaming stuff might like it.,1452729600,,329,3.8529411764705883

7282217,4,B00ZGPMBNI,"This is a US indie film that sets itself in the underground world of shooting each other for cash whilst wearing Kevlar vests. John (Ryan Kwanten) is good at the game having fallen into it for revenge and thrills. On the road he runs into Freida Pinto playing Colt who does the same thing but with a nicer vest.

Anyway they set off together and have more  to share than their love of shooting the bejesus out of people and things occur This also stars Mickey Rourke as Zorrringer  a mythical figure whom John is out to meet. For Rourke fans though please be warned that he is only on screen for a few minutes.

The make up is excellent, the soundtrack is very good and the acting is also very good. The plot is a bit of a stretch on the credulity front but I was ok with that too and it has enough of an arthouse feel to avoid many of the macho centric clichs that often befall a film that is essentially testosterone fuelled. So all in all not actually a bad effort, it does not score very highly in IMDB and I would give it seven out of ten but am rounding up as I actually quite liked it.",1449446400,,1092,4.112676056338028
7282218,4,B00ZGPMBNI,"Well, since I did the sound and mix for this...I had to get the Bluray to make sure the distribution co. didn't screw it up (as they've done so many times before). Get it. It's a decent Indie film.",1448236800,2,197,4.076923076923077

8720224,3,B00ZGPMBNI,"I had looked at the cover (on Netflix) several times and kept passing if over. I finally decided to watch and was pleasantly surprised. The cinematographer and director got this one right, it does look seedy and so do the characters. I felt invested with the outcome of the characters, I wanted to see how it played out. The dueling and how it played out was a nice touch. The dialogue between characters feels right based on the world they live and breathe in. I think this movie is worth a more critical eye when watched a second time. Yeah, I think it deserves another look. Nice indie film that could have been written better but was enjoyable just as it is. Oh, by the way the ending is a solid what just happened type of ending which makes for interesting discussion on why the director chose this ending and what motivated the characters to be who they are and to act in the way they did for the ending.",1471132800,,910,4.358823529411764
