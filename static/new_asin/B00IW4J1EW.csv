8645778,5,B00IW4J1EW,Just got today. Did a little but mostly just watched! So much fun! Totally worth it since there's nothing else like this that you can do in the privacy of your own home! Plus the little bit I did do I was winded and my legs were hurting! So excited to really get into this!!,1409616000,,274,4.0
8645779,2,B00IW4J1EW,"not super impressed with the product. i think $40 is a  little steep for the quality of the dvds. there are neat moves, but i don't think it met my expectations. the beginners dvd is not really worth the purchase...",1398470400,,215,4.375
8645780,1,B00IW4J1EW,"I opened my package and the dvds looked ok but when I tryed to play them they didn't work!! Ao I put them in my laptop, the first disc was a catalog of some man with trophies and the other two were TOAD a freaking car diagnostics cd download. Wtf!!! I will be working on getting my money back and never recommending this product ever! And it didn't even come on a box.",1396828800,,368,4.054794520547945
