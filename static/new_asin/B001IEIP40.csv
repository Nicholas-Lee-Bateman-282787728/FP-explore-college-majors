3648006,5,B001IEIP40,"I was doing research for a novel I am writing and wanted to hear the Hungarian language spoken. I was not disappointed, but am greatly appreciative that the movie is subtitled in English. Some of my classmates in high school were refugees from the Hungarian Revolution of '56. I always felt compassion for their struggle and admiration for their ability to adapt so quickly to the countries they chose to relocate to. This movie was made to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that revolution. The story comes through without the distractions of over-the-top big bang Hollywood special effects.",1371772800,,594,5.071428571428571
3648007,5,B001IEIP40,I bought this movie for my son because he is a water polo player. I watched it with him. This is a very historical movie and it was entirely entertaining and extremely interesting. Parts of it though are very sad.,1361577600,,213,4.35
3648008,5,B001IEIP40,"I was recommnended to order this fine movie by my father. He was present in Hungary during the revolution of 1956. Although he was not an active participant with the revolutionary soldiers, the depiction of what actually occurred is  very true to form. He and my mother were direct witnesses of what truly happened.
The main characters are well portrayed. The oppressive regime during the Stalinist era relied on the Hungarian secret police version of the KGB ,called the ""AVO"". Their purpose was to keep the public in  utter control.  The use of fear and psychological torture is well demonstrated in the film.

The movie's mood and style is very up to date. You are right there with the protagonists,as if it were occurring in this century.

There is no glamorized violence. Although some of the color of the Hungarian language,particularly demeaning expressions are lost with the English translation,it lends to some humor and release of tension.

One major politial message that still haunts many Hungarians to this day was the lack of response to pleas of help to the ""West"". This occurred after the massive response by the Russians which quelled the hope of a people  for freedom. After confirming that the Americans and the ""West"" ignored Hungary's request,Soviet Russia asserted her  military might to validate the fact that Hungary was still a colony and hostage to the Eastern block.

This movie would appeal to anyone who abhors  the oppression of humanity. It detailed the methods and astmosphere of what it is like to live in a  brutal police state.

There remains many of those kind of regimes in the world today including some world powers.

If you are a water polo player, as I was during college,you'll appreciate the excellent underwater shots. Scenes of the matches  portray the tension and physical viciousness  that is not obvious to the spectators. Realistic action of the sport is aided greatly by using clips of actual world class games.

Highly recommended even if you are not of Hungarian origin!",1309737600,7,2022,4.955489614243324
3648009,5,B001IEIP40,"Being a participant of the events in Hungary in 1956, it brought me back to the time and reason  I needed to leave my Homeland. I cherish this movie because it will be part of my legacy to my children and grandchildren.
I am saddened by the fact that this recent picture was so well accepted in Europe and yet has not made the scene in this country. I was happy to find this video available in the US format with English subtitles.",1261180800,13,431,4.192771084337349
3648010,5,B001IEIP40,"Great film... a presumably fictional love story set against the backdrop of the very real 1956 revolution in Hungary and the most famous water polo match in Olympic history (or any history, for that matter!).  The movie was filmed in Hungarian, but this is presumably dubbed over in English.  The original title is ""Szabadsg, szerelem"" which translates to ""freedom, love"" and is taken from a poem by the famous poet and revolutionary, Sndor Pet'fi, who played a key role in the Hungarian revolution of 1848.  However, it is given the English title, ""Children of Glory"".  Get your hands on this film, if you can!!",1256256000,3,612,4.855769230769231
3648011,4,B001IEIP40,"A love affair takes place during the outbreake of the fighting for indepeendence from the Soviet Union in Hungary in 1956. This is coupled with the preparation of the Hungarian water polo team for the Melbourne
Olimpic Games. Although the Soviets crushed the revolution in Hungary the Hungarian Waterpolo Team was victorious against the Soviet team in the semifinal game 4:0. The blood was flowing in the water as a Hungarian player was hit by a soviet player. Hungary won the gold medal in the final game. Much of the plot was real as it took place 50 years ago.",1233014400,2,563,4.64

8310855,4,B001IEIP40,"It used a personal story to highlight a few dramatic days in the history of Hungary.  Cinematography excellent. Impressive directing and acting. I had to use subtitles, and that worked well, too.",1516147200,,195,5.09375
8310856,5,B001IEIP40,"This is really great movie and I didn't expected this good.
First I expected this movie as a sports movie but it wasn't .
It's about acheiving freedom against dictatoship and intervention[interference] in the domestic affairs of Russia.
It is a story happening in Hungary during the revolution of 1956.
I usually concentrate more on actress then actor since I am a man, but in this movie the main actor was so charming I cannot but to love the actor so much. His eyes were shinning like stars. I bet no woman can deny but to fall in love with him.
I also don't like war movies that much. But in this film, the director was so smart enough for me to involve me to be on the civilian's side, that I had to hold my breath and watch them fight as if I am fighting with them towards the government soldiers.
This movie is also great not using some of the cheap documentary films to show the actual event wich happend at that time. They rather showed by using lots of crowd and imitate the actual event as if happening at the real time.
I don't know how many people watched this film but I am sure that this movie hit at the boxoffice pretty well and now it's your turn to watch it.(Actually later I had some research and found out that this film broke the new record in Hungary at the boxoffice.)
Just be sure that this movie is not all about sports. It has some love story also but it's still more about achieving freedom from Russia and dictatorship.
It's a great film and you should not hesitate to watch it!

Also it is quite surprising that the dvd was made in Korea and it's been imported to the US and still there are many people watched this dvd.
I am living in Korean and bought this in 6 $. Quite surprised how many comments there are in this website.",1453075200,,1756,4.25748502994012
8310857,2,B001IEIP40,"The movie is excellent, it captures the events quite accurately (I was there for most of the important events) and the essence, the struggle is portrayed ""par excellence"". I bought it to show my friends and family, most of them do not speak Hungarian, so the English subtitles would have been nice. However the subtitles are in Korean only, contrary to the description.",1438473600,,369,4.873015873015873
8310858,5,B001IEIP40,Very Well done. Anyone interested in a crash course on the Hungarian Revolution will appreciate this film.,1435622400,,106,5.294117647058823
8310859,4,B001IEIP40,An incredibly well-crafted film detailing how Hungary (a country made virtually non-existent by Communist occupation) wins gold at The Olympics in Water Polo against the Russian team.,1429574400,,183,5.814814814814815
8310860,5,B001IEIP40,Loved this movie. I lived through these times from the comfort of America. Tragic! The U.S. under Eisenhower did some bad things.,1415836800,,129,4.909090909090909
8310861,5,B001IEIP40,A very well made film about a crucial period in modern Hungary's history. It's rare for a movie to stick so closely to the real story about real people.,1405987200,,152,4.275862068965517
8310862,5,B001IEIP40,"Having been personally involved in that uprising in Hungary I can safely say that even though this may be clasified as historical fiction there were a lot more actual history in this film than fiction.  A few minor technical errors were evident for those in the know, to vit Soviet troops arrived in armored personnel carriers not open bodied trucks; arms and munitions were carried into Budapest from outlying depots by volunteers in commandeered trucks etc.  Excellent, very well done!",1405728000,,487,5.075
8310863,1,B001IEIP40,"The translation from Hungarian to English is poor, pathetic, inadequate...,Many scenes are incomprehensible for non Hungarian speakers You should find a professional translator",1384905600,3,176,6.695652173913044
