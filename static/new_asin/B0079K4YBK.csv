If you like this anime then I reccomend buying the whole box set, much cheaper that way.",1389398400,,257,4.608695652173913

5066655,2,B0079K4YBK,"The opening of this series isn't bad. It begins with the conquest of a nation and the exile of the heirs to the throne.
The hero with no memories saves them, he is named Guin. Guin then saves these two heirs repeatedly using means and methods so tripe that you can tell they are written into the plot. At one point he just confronts and beats the antagonist to a pulp. Given he is so strong there is little tension at this point. The plot then gets even worse. As an example. While traveling to confront a group of giants Guin finds a small crystal on the side of a mountain. It ends up that this crystal is conveniently the god of the giants and they start to worship him. There is no reason he should have found the crystal other than it was the next plot point in the story.

And so the story repeats. Hero is confronted with an army. Hero finds Mcguffin. Hero defeats army's leader but still has to retreat to be hunted again. Then bigger army comes and it repeats.

So I would not recomend buying the full series. It runs out of steam after the first 5 episodes.",1371513600,,1067,4.2254901960784315
5066656,4,B0079K4YBK,"14 year old twins, Princess Rinda and Prince Remus, escape from their home city when it is attacked by the Mongaul, using a strange device hidden in the palace which transports them to the Forest of Rood. There they encounter a strange leopard-headed man named Guin. Guin saves them from Mongaul solders and then continues to travel with and protect them while he searches for his lost memories and the meaning of the only thing he does remember, the word ""Aurra.""

I enjoyed this series. I couldn't really care about any of the characters (the twins are especially annoying), but the world was fascinating and the mysteries many. It was interesting just to see where the characters ended up next. The politics were also fun. The plotting, the scheming, the deception!

Guin Saga is an epic fantasy story that spanned 130 light novels (short books, but it adds up). The series ran from 1979 to 2009, when the author died before finishing it. Needless to say, the anime doesn't have a complete ending. The immediate problem is solved, but you don't get to learn most of the secrets the series introduces you to (yup, no explanation about Guin).

Despite its flaws, Guin Saga is a pretty fun series and it worth watching if you enjoy fantasy.",1354060800,3,1240,4.731481481481482
5066657,5,B0079K4YBK,"LOVED this series. -And in ENGLISH TOO@!!???!?!??
Normally I'm not so into the english-dubbed versions, but the acting was top notch and the story, -that I honestly happened to pick randomly for no reason, had me watching non-stop for three days. -Only to find out that there is No Season 2!!!
Waaaahh. Need Prozac now :(
 SUCH a great and very intricate and incredibly well-woven story and very well done.. such a shame they didn't produce a second, and continuing seasons. -so if you're reading....  producer people,. Please get on it. You guys did an amazing job.
I will definitely be picking up the books, but the show is outstanding. -Also, Eureka 7 is another absolutely fantastic show -I watched that in Japanese. One of my all-time fav's. :)  -anyhow, Guin Saga:
I'm still in shock at how much I enjoyed it. Now I miss it. -Been looking for anything even close only to turn off netflix in frustration at there being nothing as yet I've found to be its equal - Especially in the music. -Absolutely can not stand anything less than a great orchestral score to not jolt you out of the story by an annoyingly pathetic attempt at ""Cool RnB"" music that is utterly out of place in any epic saga and should have their music supervisor fired immediately when they suggest it. I'mean, Honestly,... the LAST thing you want to hear when you are knee and soul deep in a great story is something that sounds like it belongs on the Grand Theft Auto station suddenly pop up in the middle of an intense moment.
I digress....
Point is, if you have a heart and avoid las vegas as a general rule, you will love this show.
I hope one day there is more to come.
Until then, a second watch through is on the books and also getting the Actual books as well.
Enjoy.
Peace, Love and a giant, leopard warrior that can somehow pull off not being cheesy. Absolutely amazing.
Cheers!",1347667200,5,1861,4.516320474777448
5066658,4,B0079K4YBK,"This is one of the better anime series I have seen. I won't give away much of the story but I enjoyed watching this. It was tastefully done, viewable by a younger audience than many anime series and movies these days, yet intellectual enough for an adult viewer. There were character arcs that I would have like to have been resolved better at the end of the series, but this probably cannot be helped since this is an adaptation of the beginning of a large series of books. The way this series ends has closure but leaves room for more story to be told, and the books probably continue the story. I particularly wanted to know the mysterious origins of the character Guin, but this DVD set does not reveal this. I hope that one day they will continue this series so I can see what happens next, but since it has been a few years since this show has aired, that is not likely. Despite the loose ends left at the end, this series is worth watching and I highly recommend it.",1342656000,8,973,4.3224043715847

8512820,5,B0079K4YBK,"It is one marvelous medieval adventure with a fantastic hero that has marked me for life, it has a complete story that is developed from many different points of view while at the same tome showing the struggle of the main characters over politics and his personal struggle, this is truly a masterpiece that manages to show the epic nature of Guin path as a hero as it only gets better every time I look at it. At the end i was left with a huge need of more but sandly there is not a second season yet.
I really loved how they show the development of every character either for good or bad, with all their flaws each character either acknowledge their flaws and try to improve or loose themselves to a different path blinded by their vision.
The music of this series could be used as the definition of beauty on its own, it is the first time that i have enjoyed this genre of music so much and on its own it earned a spot on my top music.",1416268800,,938,4.15934065934066
