2223994,5,B0007OC1GU,"This is a great DVD to exercise with.  I had a similar one years ago and wanted to find one that would work for me.  As a senior citizen, my body doesn't function as it did 20 years ago.  This one is perfect.",1369094400,,208,3.7906976744186047
2223995,4,B0007OC1GU,"This is a great workout for people just starting out, or people who have never used a stability ball before.  I used just the Give Me 20 workout for 3 months (a few days a week at least) and got some killer abs for a trip to Hawaii several years ago!  If I could post a picture of them from then I would!  Since then I my strength and endurance has increased drastically so i've moved on to longer and more challenging workouts, but I still always incorporate a stablility in almost all my workouts.  You are engaging your core the entire time you are sitting or laying on the ball or holding it while doing ANY workout moves (i.e. holding it when doing squats, sitting on it when lifting weights for your upper body, etc.).  I NEVER do traditional sit ups or crunches and i'm able to maintain a ""6 pack"".  I would highly recommend this workout to any beginner wanting to gain strength, muscle definition, or a strong sleek core.  I will still throw this workout in when I am crunched on time or not feeling 100%.  Increasing the weight with this DVD can give anyone a solid short workout!",1358294400,3,1089,4.356435643564357
2223996,5,B0007OC1GU,"I used this DVD,Core Secrets FunDamentals, years ago and had great results. I bragged so much that my DVD went missing. I couldn't find the DVD online or in local stores. My friend referred me to Amazon.com. He relies on Amazon.com. I am back to fundamental exercising and back to bragging.",1339718400,3,290,4.705882352941177
2223997,4,B0007OC1GU,"I had done this routine a few years before with good results, was glad to find the DVD again. With the appropriate weights its a great ""all-in-one"" workout, ie., cardio, abs and arms.",1272067200,,183,4.575757575757576
2223998,2,B0007OC1GU,This is not much of a workout. One explains the fundamentals of the ball and the other is a small workout.,1269302400,,106,4.095238095238095
2223999,3,B0007OC1GU,I didn't like FUN-Damentals I found it kind of dull! it was just Brooke and Gunnar showing you different movements nothing exciting I think it's better for beginners GIVE ME 20 was good,1267833600,2,185,4.636363636363637
2224000,5,B0007OC1GU,"I spent only $10 so far on Core Secrets and got a lot of value in return. Gunnar Peterson is a great teacher (easy to understand) and gives you a product that is thorough and well organized. He didn't forget anything. You get  the ball, training log and eating guide which will make a big difference in your health if you stick with it. Gunnar is no nonsense and down to earth. He teaches you what you need to know and then gives you an appropriate workout that uses the same skills. The ball is super easy to inflate unlike Gaiam's ball package. Core Secret's comes with a foot pedal and key to inflate/deflate. Plus you get a training log on which to write your exercise routine... to keep you honest about your workouts. Brooke is not annoying she gives great advice if Gunnar forgets a detail. I plan to buy the next level but am glad that I have a month to perfect the Give Me 20 exercises first (they are pretty easy to perfect but you have to do them!). Anyway I am very happy I spent $10 on the introductory package.",1185494400,13,1024,4.278350515463917
2224001,5,B0007OC1GU,It is great if you are just starting out because it shows how to do the moves and what to avoid.,1182211200,9,96,3.619047619047619
2224002,5,B0007OC1GU,"Being a single mother with a young child I had trouble finding the time for my workout. Buying some workout DVD's solved this problem, so now I exercise every other day when my child has gone to bed. I bought two of the core secrets DVD's and I must say that I love them! They really work! The most important thing is that I have fun all the time, even after playing the DVD's again and again I don't seem to get bored as I did with some other workout DVD's I bought. Another important thing is that I can make the exercises as hard or easy as I want to, so they are suitable for beginners but they will also make those who are advanced sweat. Gunnar really seams to know what he's doing and talks you through the exercises which guarantees you will do them right. But he also has humor that will make you laugh along the way. So, if you want exercises that work and are lots of fun I recommend you try this one along with the other core secrets DVD's :)",1158019200,3,954,4.106951871657754
2224003,5,B0007OC1GU,"This review is for the Give Me 20 workout on this DVD only.  I thought that this was a great workout combining strength training with the stability ball, and I really enjoyed it.  In just 20 minutes, you will hit all major muscle groups, and you will definitely feel worked out by the end!  Instructor Gunnar Peterson begins with a 3.5 minute warm-up on the ball; he gets right into things with squats and lunges (using the ball for balance) plus some static stretches.  In the next segment (3 minutes), you'll lie on your back with your feet on the ball and holding a weight across your chest for abs work; you also roll onto your side to work the obliques.  Next you return to standing for the ""woodsman"" move--holding the ball over your head to one side, you sort of chop it down to the other side, coming to a lunge.  Gunnar does two sets, and I really felt these!  You'll continue the leg work with some rear lunges and then sit on the ball for flies and rows (4 minutes total for the standing/seated segment).

Gunnar then has you lie over the ball for more upper body work, including flies and chest press.  Seated on the ball, you'll do side lats and an overhead chest press.  You'll do another abs move with weights on the ball and then finish off the upper body on the ball with bicep and hammer curls (5.5 minutes total).  Next, you'll return to the floor for a final 4-minute segment. First, you'll do a triceps press with your feet on the ball, then you'll repeat the abs series from the beginning, this time without any weights.  Gunnar ends the workout with some very quick stretches to finish.  I can definitely see myself using this workout often, particularly when I'm short on time--highly recommended!",1125964800,55,1721,4.512903225806451

You can always incorporate it with other workouts as you progress.  I go to a gym as well.  There are more  advanced workouts you can find on CD by Gunnar Peterson or find more exercises to add  on youtube. Great for building strength.",1409184000,,357,3.9859154929577465

8049542,5,B0007OC1GU,"I used to use this DVD daily back in 2004. I loaned it out so many times, that someone decided to just keep it. I found this one on Amazon for a great price.

I wanted to supplement my current workout routine so that I could get in a good workout at home when I don't have time for the gym. I love Gunnar and this workout. It is not really hardcore, but it is as hardcore as you make it. If you think this is easy, then bump up your weights. You will feel a difference for sure. I feel like I get a good full body workout in 20 minutes. Should not be your whole fitness plan, but great for when you want to squeeze in a quick workout.",1380672000,,634,3.8396946564885495
