8140938,1,B000HRMDJC,"to me,this documentary is not really that good.first of all,it just
didn't have a professional look to it.a lot of the people they
interviewed really just gave their opinion on things,but there were no
real facts.plus,some of the people didn't really have great credentials
either.there was definitely a theme of sensationalism running through
the program.i also didn't find it compelling.in fact,much of it is
downright boring.not the best documentary i have seen on this
subject,or any subject for that matter.overall,i just felt it was
poorly done.the back of the DVD box claims this is a groundbreaking
documentary,among other things.but it isn't really.i certainly wouldn't
recommend it to others.for me,Alien Gods is a 1/5",1204329600,,728,5.451327433628318
8140939,5,B000HRMDJC,It was really amazing how the director really got the ufo people to let their guards down and speak frankly about the idea of life being created by extraterrestrials. The graphics and the music were cool too!,1170806400,2,208,4.648648648648648
