8085831,4,B000BF0WI4,"The information on this video is incorrect.  The company who put it out is KARL LORIMAR, NOT, Simitar, the latter of which is a knockoff EP speed bunch of vidiots.  KARL LORIMAR was a quality label, and they presented a very nice program here in SP SPEED.  First, they have a coming attractions short called HIGHRISE, where a bug monster swoops down from outer space and swipes a high rise office building in it's talons, all done in incredible stop-animation.  Then we see DISCIPLES OF THE CORN, which was my favorite of the two, although all of these college student films in the two collections are first rate.  Contrary to the other reviewer, who you should disregard, because the word 'CHEESE' is in his vocabulary, and he knows nothing of the film's history, since it pre-dates the movie, and every critic in the civilized world considers it superior to the movie.  I agree completely with that analysis.  It is a creepy, no fluff, eerie piece of work that packs more energy and symbolism into King's story than the movie, which is the real knockoff.  The second film, NIGHT WAITER, is also well made and features some stark cinematography.  Both are shot on high quality color film.  I passed on the other collection because it was put out on another cheap EP speed company, Interglobal.  Can you imagine the cheapness in a company that can't see clear to providing enough tape to cover a collection that is under 60 minutes??? The tape must look like the leader of an SP speed tape.",1335484800,2,1490,4.670498084291188
8085832,2,B000BF0WI4,"Two nightshift videos both with two shorts. These two movies complete my collection of every available Stephen King movie. Now about this movie which contains two shorts. Firstly, ""The diciples of the crow."" This is a cheesy knock off of ""The Children of the corn."" I must say I can't recomed this short as it has a begining but no end, The main characters drive off and nothing happens from there except the end. Good to watch once but do it before you buy the actual ""Children of the Corn,"" movie which is a classic and one of the first movies of King's collection I ever bought. This short is the sole reason I give this video such a low rating. It is so bad it stinks up the next short which is much better. ""The Night Waiter,"" winner of an emmy and deservingly so. I won't spoil the story but if you've ever seen another of King's movies called, ""1408,"" then your prepared for a similar ride. Sure the effects are lacking and a skelaton and dirty feet aren't that scarry but the voice of the ghost is chilling. It has a quick and surprising ending that leaves the viewer wanting more. If only this were a big budget film with all the bells, whistles, and content and you'd have a great film. But then again only one of two haunted hotel movies written by the same author can get the glory. If you liked 1408 you will love this little gem. Too bad the first short was such a stinker.",1304640000,,1387,4.297709923664122
8085833,5,B000BF0WI4,"I`ve waited a long time for a DVD of this show but no luck, so I broke down and purchased the VHS which was not the best picture but better than nothing.",1269475200,,153,3.8125
