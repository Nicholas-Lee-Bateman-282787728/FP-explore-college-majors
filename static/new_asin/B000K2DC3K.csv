It was hard to discern which was which, when ordering. I'm happy to now have two of the series and will get the other one soon.",1517529600,,292,4.327272727272727

In this video, Buck explains the various equipment that you will need and how to use it.

He explains that he has gone from a 5/8"" bosal to a 3/8"" bosal and a "" mecate.  He shows both a half breed mouth piece and a spade bit.  While he explains the mechanics of how the mouth piece is made with a flair for the bosal to fit beneath it, I wish that he would have gone into greater detail regarding how each of these mouth pieces actually operates in the horse's mouth.  Also, I wish that he would have discussed the romal reins in greater detail.  He might have wanted to address such questions as why they are made the way that they are, what is important in a good set of romal reins, rein chains, etc.

Since you won't lead your horse by the reins, he shows you how to tie a neck rope around your horse's neck for leading.  He also shows you the use of the bosalito.  He explains that this really serves no purpose, but is more of a tradition and a sign of respect for the effort that your horse has put into his education to this point in his life.  He shows you how to tie it to the forelock and how to take it off.  I think that this is a really neat tradition to carry on.  He also shows the traditional vaquero way of trimming your horse's mane to indicate his level of education.

 He shows you how to hold and handle both reins and reviews basic exercises that you will want to do at the walk, trot and canter, such as haunches in,  getting and maintaining a soft feel, leg yields, subtle transitions between gaits, simple changes, flying changes, counter canter and backing in circles.

At the end, he does a little cutting and roping and shows how you will put all of these exercises to work in a cow working situation.  Here he talks a little about teaching your horse to mirror the cow, pressing off and drawing the cow to you if you want to.  He does his cutting on a 16/2 Thoroughbred that is really getting with the program!  He also demonstrates how you might gently handle the roping of a cow with two ropes - one around the neck and the other around the hind legs.

Overall, this is a fantastic video.  If you want to watch a master at his craft, you can't do any better than this three DVD series.  Watching Buck ride a horse is poetry in motion.  It's the picture that you want to have in your own mind as you ride your own horse.  If you ever have an opportunity to ride in one of his clinics, or just watch, do it.  Besides being a superb horseman, he is a fine human being.",1165190400,5,2526,4.137577002053388
