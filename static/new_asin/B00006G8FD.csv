1754229,5,B00006G8FD,"This man is one of the most under-rated actors in hollywood.  Not only did I enjoy his James Bond, I look for all other work that he has done.  This was a good piece.",1363046400,,166,3.8529411764705883

1754231,2,B00006G8FD,"Is dashing Pierce Brosnan a wife murderer?

Is he a manipulative cad?  Is he telling the truth or is Virginia Madsen?  And why is an average looking Jobeth Williams such a desired commodity for Brosnan?

These and many other questions are left unanswered in this made for TV dud.  The script tries to be Hitchcockian in its many twists, but Hitch knew how to make those twists convincing, whereas the writers of RAW HEAT merely hoped for any similarities.  Williams as a shrink does a real no-no in revealing something a client told her in confidence; she also vacillates back and forth in trying to assess Brosnan's duplicity, and the end is so uh-oh, what have I done, it makes no sense.  And who really killed Brosnan's wife?

Brosnan is an automaton, capitalizing on his suave looks, and Madsen shows some of the talent that would eventually lead to her Oscar nominated performance in SIDEWAYS.  But RAW HEAT is DEAD COLD in my book.",1111449600,,937,4.664634146341464
1754232,1,B00006G8FD,"A word to the wise:  I purchased this for my wife's Pierce Brosnan collection only to discover that it is a re-titled re-release of ""Victim of Love"", which we already owned on DVD.  Buyer beware: two versions of the same DVD are being listed for sale simultaneously under different titles and packaging without any disclosure of the duplicate content.",1041292800,23,351,4.932203389830509

7968371,3,B00006G8FD,I would give this movie a four but the picture quality was poor. Suspenseful. with wild mind games. I didn't see any chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and the female actors but he looked great.,1489622400,,192,4.676470588235294
