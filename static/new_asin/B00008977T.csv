1830634,5,B00008977T,"This series introduces a new take on the after life when Yuske Yurimeshie saves a little boy and dies in the process, sort of.  Death is a beautiful woman named Boton, and the underworld is run by a baby!  Anyway, Yuske finds a way back to life, with powers of course, and as his adventures against demons and authority lead him to better power and friends, he comes up against powerful foes that would like nothing better than to kill him, permanently.  Yuske faces the Saint Beasts, and a demon with 99 spirit moves to use.  As this part winds down, Yuske faces a seemingly unbeatable opponent, a demon that looks human, but is unbelievably strong.  This all leads up to the challenge to enter the Dark Tournament, the next Season.  An overall good series with characters that can keep a light atmosphere while still giving very human perfomances.",1062892800,,849,4.6644295302013425
1830635,3,B00008977T,"Ok this show is a good show alright. I'm not taking anything away from it. These first 25 episodes of yu yu are good but they do tend to get boring. I would not buy this dvd if anyone plans on watching it over once or twice. But I do reccomend it for people who like the anime and like to watch it over and over again. I would definetly wait till the dark tournament box set comes out. A much better saga, better animation and fight scenes are way better.",1057622400,,455,4.010989010989011
1830636,4,B00008977T,"This series is just plain fun, especially if you appreciate anime or manga.  Anyone who doesn't like it cause it follows the pattern of the hero always kicking [booty] should take a good hard look at american action movies and shows and realize the [garbage] on tv shovels that theme out way more than the japanese.  The series also exemplifies the power of human emotions and their spirit.  Even if you are not a fan of anime, you should try this out cause it has action, comedy, drama, romance and a lil somethin for perverts.  Don't judge it by the edited and dubbed garbage]you see on tv, this has all the blood and cursing you could want in a show.  And if you aren't too lazy to read, i suggest watching the subtitled version in japanese, because the americanized version is ok, yet doesn't hold true to the characters as well as the original voice cast.  And the only reason I give this one only 4 stars is because the animation is sometimes sloppy and weak, but this is only because it is a very old anime, and because the creators had tight budgets.  But I think you will enjoy it all the same like you would appreciate any black and white classic.",1057363200,18,1157,4.403755868544601
1830637,4,B00008977T,"The story is about Yusuke a boy ""about 14-15"" who is considered a huge thug. He is somewhat of a bully at the school though more of a thug. He is the strongest punk in the whole school and as such people treat him like a punk. The teachers hate him and the students fear him. However Yusuke gives his life for a little boy and such a courageous act as well as an unexpected one gives him the chance to be granted life once more.
This is a pretty good anime and while he seems immortal remember he loses his life once and almost twice and unlike such animes as DBZ they can't be brought back to life. When you lose in this game you die so I see no reason why the director would want Yusuke to be deleted from the series.",1056931200,,719,4.0
1830638,5,B00008977T,"I haven't bought this set but I know the series well. Anime is great(much better than in the US). This is about a boy name Yuskae(can't spell it right)Yuramishe who one day saves a boy life but dies in the doing. It so happens that the car wasn't to kill either of them and Yuskae has to go through ordeals to get his life back, but with doing so learns to use his Spirt energy in which he becomes detective of the spirt world. This has change the boy's life with him being in only middle school, but I promise you you will not be dissopointed with this great series that awaits you.(btw the theme song is very catchy!)",1056758400,,619,4.2100840336134455
1830639,1,B00008977T,".......  Ok, first off, I'm not too into anime, so I find it ridiculous for fans to give every single anime a perfect score.  That's what most anime fans do.  It's really odd.  So if you're not really into animation, you'd be better off reading this review than a dude who's totally obsessed with the stuff.  Not to say we don't all have our obssesions...  it's just, from an outsider's perspective, the Japanese do some really stupid things in their animation.  (Such as Domon in Mobile Fighter G Gundam splitting his Gundam into multiple to block incoming prjectiles--it's a robot, and CAN'T DO THAT!!!!!)
Ok, in a nutshell:
This show's about a dude who dies.  Then he's awakened to become a spirit detective and he comes back to life.  (I'm sparing you the details--read one of the major fan's reviews for the gist of the plot.)  Anywho, he's been awakened to realize that he has to stop these demons because he can now control his own spirit energies, which all humans have but most never use.  You see where this is going, right?  He can point his finger like a gun and actually shoot from it.  A dumb idea, but it's actually kinda funny.  The show's pretty original, and honestly deserves about 2-3 stars, but with the amount of 5 stars given this thing by anime fans (we already went over this, most think every one is a masterpiece), it needs to be off-set.  Anyways, this is a decent show, but the amount of absolutely stupid things that the characters are capable of doing is pretty lame.  Of course, being an anime, the main character is practically a god that, even though he can (and is @ the beginning) be killed, he beats everything in his path.  (Like Domon again...)  LISTEN UP ANIMATORS!  Quit making these characters out to be gods!  LET THEM LOSE EVERY NOW AND THEN!
Whew!  Well, that about sums it up.  There are a lot of flaws in this show, but it's ok, overall.  I wouldn't bother if you've never seen an anime.  But if you're a hardcore anime fan--you'll love this show.  For the rest of us--don't bother, it's actually kinda dumb.",1056067200,,2055,4.5340599455040875
1830640,4,B00008977T,"If you've never seen the series then I'm sure your questioning buying this. My advice is check out the other reviews be it in the idiviual dvds themself or on this item combineing them.
As I don't have it in front of me I beleave this is a 9 disc set containing 3-4 episodes per dvd. This is the first arc of the series which spans 112 episodes. It only gets better as you go along.
I would recomend this over buying just the first couple as if you hate the first couple and wanna return them it's just as easy if you hate this to return it. But should you like it which I have a hunch you will you save yourself some money getting them all at once than buying each one seperately. Plus you get a nice little box to hold them in. Also on a side not I personally hate waiting for the next episode so this was ideal for me. As I got a alot of for alittle. Took me about 2.5 days to watch the whole arc.
Just to mention this for you people still saying well this is alot of money for me to spend on something I've never seen. The series is being aired on Cartoon network on toonami at 6pm currently. They seem to be changing their time slots alot lately. But check out a couple of episodes there to see if you like it.
If you like animae I think you will enjoy this most defintally. =)",1049932800,10,1282,3.992217898832685
1830641,5,B00008977T,"This is really one of the most charming anime series to come along in a great long while.  The basic premise is; young punk ne'er do well (Yusuke Urameshi) does ONE good deed and dies in the process.  The spirits are so flabbergasted by this, they decide to give him another chance.  The first couple episodes are comedic gems as the disembodied Yusuke uses all his ghostly powers (suggestion,possession, etc.) to try and convince his alcoholic mother, would-be girlfriend, and schoolyard rival not to cremate his body.  Okay, this is an ongoing series, so I don't think it'll ruin anything, but...
The real strength of this series is its characterizations.  This set mostly introduces characters who will play a major role in the rest of the series, so you get a lot of first impressions, but they are good ones.  The kids and even the demons are likable, and their enemies thoroughly evil (as they should be!).  The interplay of the characters is at times very funny.  This series has a wonderful sense of imagination and humor.  Some of the jokes and language are a little adult at times, and there's a lot of violence (some of the fights stretch over two or more episodes), but overall its very lighthearted and fun.
Highly recommended.",1048032000,24,1240,4.757009345794392

1830673,5,B00008977T,"Having only watched a few episodes on adult swim before i got this, i had no idea what was in store for me, i was plesantly surprised.  If you like Dragon Ball and all that, then you'll love Yu Yu Hakesho.  This anime is halarious and has on the edge of your seat suspense when it comes down till whether or not Yusuke will ever come back to life again, or whether or not he will succed ion his struggle with Rando and Suzaku.

The japanese lanquage track is great and preferable to the english track where if you compare between the two you will find the dubbed translation is very inaccurate at times compared to the subtitles.

I find nothing wrong with this series at all....it is one all can love and enjoy, although with some adult themes and lanquage you may want to keep it away from little kids unless you are watching it in english.",1104019200,8,842,4.310126582278481

(the red head above) People who like bad boys will love Hiei and his trademark 'Hn'. The animation isn't too good in some episodes, but the plotline more than makes up for that. The fights aren't overly dramatic or gory, and unlike DBZ, they don't drag on and on and on.....the character's rise in power is pretty believable, and over time you get really attached to the characters. (I cried when Genkai died it twas very sad) So, this series is neatly balanced, with sweet but not overly sweet moments, fighting, but not so much that it dominates the plotline, and comedy, but not so much that the series goes fluff.",1094860800,3,774,4.7835820895522385

1830677,5,B00008977T,"This series is amazing, its got comedy, drama, action all rolled up in one. The english version is hilarious, the charachter kuabara is a riot, just listening to him talk sets me rolling on the floor. A must see series",1078963200,,218,4.475
1830678,4,B00008977T,"""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is a shounen (young teen male) fight series that excels above others in this genre.  The first season introduces us to the character of Yusuke Urameshi, a young punk who's single act of charity in giving up his life to save a young child causes the defacto ruler of the Sprit World ,Koenma-sama, to give him a 2nd chance.  As such, Yusuke is assigned cases in which youkai (demons) criminals are on the loose and must be defeated.  Yusuke is joined in this by former rival Kuwabara and ex-criminal youkai Hiei and Kurama as well as cute Botan (similar to Death) who serves as their intermediary and guide.
The English dub is well cast and the voice actors try to capture the spirit of their Japanese counterparts.  They do tend to butcher names though.  The English dub script is given a fairly heavy domestication treatment which will give the series a more ""kiddy"" feel.  However English subtitles for the Japanese dub are very accurate and virtually undomesticated.  Not only are Japanese honorifics left in, but terms such as ""youkai"", ""yoki"", and all of the Japanese attack names remain intact.  This is an unusual move as far as American companies go, however for the hardcore ""fanboy"" ""otaku"" fans who watch the subtitles, this will be a very welcome addition.  Not to worry, Japanese terms are either defined or the Japanese script defines them, so you'll know what they mean.
That aside, the accuracy of the translation of the Japanese script will show that it is the superior script over the English dub script.  Those who watch English dubs will enjoy that version of YYH, but those willing to try out the Japanese version with subtitles will enjoy the story more as it is more intelligent at times and has the funnier jokes.  But the point is that FUNimation knows there are two audiences for anime and have done their best to accomidate both.  In this, FUNimation succeeds greatly.
The only downside is that most of the DVD's only contain 3 episodes which is a waste of space.
Bottom line: fans of YYH will want to get the box set to save some money.  Whether you are a casual anime fan or a hardcore anime fan, FUNimation has you covered on this series.  The series is good for some mindless, fun entertainment.",1076889600,39,2241,4.669211195928753
1830679,5,B00008977T,"Yu Yu Hakusho is the story of a boy named Yusuke Urameshi, a 14 year old 8th grade delinquent that attends Sarayashiki Junior High. Now one of the things that I like about this anime is the fun and interesting personalities of the characters. The dialouge is also very well scripted. You also get to experience Junior High from the eyes of a not-so-average student.
In Japan, gangs and rivalries are rampant in schools, and this anime portray's that perfectly. The characters are all fun and interesting and have you always wondering what they are going to say next. This show has a little bit of everything: action, adventure, fighting, romance, and the occasional pervert.
The name ""Urameshi"" is a phrase stereotypically said by wailing ghosts. The ""Yu"" in Yusuke's name and the title is written with the kanji for ghost.(Shonen Jump, 7/03)
Yoshihiro Togashi does an excellent job with the animation and story. I highly recommend checking this anime out, and also check out the Yu Yu Hakusho movies.",1075334400,4,1001,4.894117647058824

but the beginning is necessary for understanding the whole story line. this is a better deal than buying the dvds separately.
the characters are well developed and not only age over time, but change and grow emotionally as well. it's not just a fighting or adventure anime, there is some serious themes woven in as well.
overall it's exciting and hilarious...a must see for all ages.",1066435200,,581,4.762376237623762

7980352,4,B00008977T,"Life is hard, and then you die. If you're unlucky, like Yusuke Urameshi, then life gets harder AFTER you die.

In fact, death is only the beginning of his troubles in the first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho."" While this action-comedy series lags during the first few episodes (seriously, a whole episode about Kuwabara's schoolwork?), it picks up considerably once the eclectic main characters are introduced, and Yusuke starts spending his time working as a spirit detective.

Despite a reputation as a hardened rebel, Yusuke was killed knocking a toddler from the path of a moving car. Turns out the afterlife, aka Spirit World, didn't expect such a selfless act -- so Spirit World's toddler ruler Koenma offers him a second chance at life, with the help of the sprightly Botan. After seeing how the people around him are responding to his death -- including his rival Kuwabara and semi-girlfriend Keiko -- Yusuke agrees.

But that's a lot easier said than done, and only another selfless act keeps Yusuke from being permanently dead. And his return is conditional -- now he's working for Koenma as Spirit Detective. And his first case is a doozy -- retrieve three stolen artifacts from a demon trio, including the ruthless Hiei and mysterious Kurama. But Yusuke soon finds that Kurama's motives are a lot more complicated than he thought -- and that Hiei has a very nasty fate in mind for Keiko.

On Koenma's orders Yusuke signs up for an aging martial-artist's Pick-A-Student competition, to hunt down a lethal demon -- and his psychic rival Kuwabara may be in danger. And when rage-inducing insects start swarming his town, Yusuke and Kuwabara are sent to stop the malevolent demon band responsible for it. What's more they have some reluctant new allies -- the paroled Hiei and Kurama.

But Yusuke receives an even more sensitive assignment after that -- rescue a beautiful ice maiden from a human crimelord. To complicate matters, Kuwabara has fallen in love with her, and she's also Hiei's twin sister. But as the boys fight their way into the fortified mansion, they can't even imagine the danger that is guarding the ice maiden... and just slavering for a fight with them.

The first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is all about introducing the characters, and easing Yusuke into his new role as Spirit Detective. It starts off rather slowly, with a string of episodes all about Yusuke floating around yelling at people, occasionally possessing Kuwabara and helping the big friendly lug with his homework. It's a rather bland start to an action-series.

But things start picking up when Yusuke is made Spirit Detective. Then we're treated to grotesque demonic opponents, superpowers, nasty spells, and lots of action-packed sequences involving fists, lightning, lava, swords and rose vines. And the villains get way worse with each successive battle, right up to the explosive fight at the end of the first season.

It's not all action, though. There's some romantic stuff between the bickering Yusuke and Keiko, as well as Kuwabara's adorable crush on Hiei's sister. And there's a pretty hefty dose of humor as well -- the pacifier-sucking Koenma and his overworked office ogres, Kuwabara's kitten, or Genkai's torturous training. Funny dialogue too (""We're just watching fuzz."" ""Fuzz, yes fuzz! We find it relaxing"").

Yusuke makes a solid anti-hero, with his alcoholic mother and a mile-wide rebellious streak. While he's a bit obnoxious at first, his increasing strength and responsibility make him more likable. And his thuggish-looking classmate Kuwabara makes an unexpected ally, since he turns out to be a lot more powerful and sweet-natured than you'd expect.

The crabby, lethal Hiei is still something of an enigma here, but Kurama more than makes up for that -- he's graceful, elegant, and has a very peculiar past as a foxy thief with a rose whip. We've also got a number of interesting supporting characters, such as Botan the perky Grim Reaper, Genkai the crusty martial-artist, and the feisty Keiko who proves to be Yusuke's only weak spot.

It's worth noting that the edited and unedited versions of the series are quite different -- the edited versions lack some of the gorier, more violent moments, and some of the more colourful words have been redubbed with more tame alternatives.

The first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is there to warm up the storyline, and introduce the main characters. While the beginning is a bit slow, it's a solid beginning to a good anime.",1227052800,,4483,4.978609625668449

7980355,5,B00008977T,"If you're the type of person who likes anime that delivers a mix of beat-em-up with deep character and story development then you've found a nice gem.  Yu Yu Hakusho's story starts off with a boy living the tough life, being a local knock-out tough guy.  With a constant pessimist outlook towards life he often only thinks of himself and skips school as to his advantage.  One day it all changes instantly for him as he suddenly finds himself dead.

Thus starts a series of decisions for the boy named Yusuke, he finds himself as a Spirit Detective whose job is to apprehend criminal demons who're making trouble in the Human world.  What makes this series stand out is the delivery of his assignments and the variety of battles he faces with his friends, an old rival, an anti-hero demon, and an expert theif demon born anew as human.  Not a typical rag-tag bunch but together they are a potent force against the trials they face.

With many plot twists and likable characters it's hard to not like the series, though after the Dark Tournament saga many tend to argue that this is the start of the series de-evolution.  I tend to disagree as it was such a turn of events that provides a satisfying end to the series.  It is one that will stay in your heart as a oft overlooked gem if not a classic.

The only letdown I see with the series is that the fights tend to be tedious at points and may turn off people not patient enough to stick it through, but it is nothing in scale like the infamous DBZ never-ending fights.  If you get past this then you have in your hands a classic worthy of owning.",1165622400,,1599,4.386440677966101
7980356,5,B00008977T,"The Spirit Detective Saga is YuYu Hakusho at its most original, its most action-packed, and its all-around best.  The Dark Tournament Saga was good, but a lot of anim series also have fighting tournaments (look no further than Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z), so that left a little to be desired.  The final two sagas were rushed and they just weren't up to par, which is why I've always believed the series should've ended with the conclusion of The Dark Tournament Saga.

The Spirit Detective Saga represents Yusuke at his most accessible as a character, going to school and all that.  He accepts his missions with reluctance, which is when I like him best.  Yusuke hasn't yet willingly taken on the role of the hero.  He isn't really ridiculously strong here, either.  He doesn't fight his fights using a lot of Spirit Power, he's still a real street fighter.  He's a real punk here, and in my opinion, his best as a character and a hero.

In the Spirit Detective Saga, there are also the introductions of the other three main characters (Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei).  Kurama and Hiei are villains at first, and not yet the close ""friends"" that they become in later sagas.  While I like the camaraderie that comes about in The Dark Tournament and Chapter Black, I like seeing Hiei as a villain.  Hiei is a really good villain and, out of all the villains in the series, he's my favorite.  He's evil purely for the sake of being evil.  Kurama was supposed to be a villain, but he softened up.  And Kuwabara...well, he's just a doofus in the English dub.  He doesn't really change or mature in the duration of the series, he just gets new powers.  I've come to believe that he's the comic relief guy.

The battles in The Spirit Detective Saga are the best.  Yusuke struggles in most of his fights in The Spirit Detective Saga, which makes the fights interesting.  The weapons he uses, like the Spirit Gun, are also introduced for the first time.  Their originality fades away after they're used hundreds of times (probably) over the rest of the course of the series.

The series itself reaches its peak at the battle with the Saint Beasts.  The four main characters (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, and Kurama) all band together to fight the beasts.  The fights are great, the action is superb, and there's always a funny retort by Yusuke to be heard.  He loses some of his wit in the later sagas.

After the Saint Beasts, Toguro is introduced and The Dark Tournament storyline is ushered in.  The Dark Tournament is still good, but The Spirit Detective Saga is where it's at.  I own both The Spirit Detective Saga and The Dark Tournament Saga, and I can say with confidence that The Spirit Detective Saga is Yuyu Hakusho's absolute pinnacle.  If you have to own one Yuyu Hakusho saga, this is the one to buy.",1135641600,8,2797,4.593939393939394

That made no sence but im sure you know what i mean. 3/4 of my siblings are watching ALL of Yu Yu from beginning to end (cuz the last DVD just came out and we wanna finish with a bang). And I'm just starting to realize how FUNNY Yu Yu is! I'm actually paying more attention and am laughing more because I actually GET the jokes! Back when i first saw the series uncut (i think i was in 3rd grade) I never got the jokes. Now, i burst out laughing like a hyena on drugs. 0.0 I hav no idea what a hyena on drugs WOULD sound like but... just work with me here! Anyway, you'll love Yu Yu and its characters! And NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO~ YYH is NOT like DBZ! (I cant believe ppl would actually compare the two! DBZ sux so much! No offence, DBZ fans). So, yyh rox, Hiei is the coolest, there is more to the series than just this box-set so don't miss out, and... BUY THE SERIES!",1122508800,,1026,4.321243523316062
7980358,5,B00008977T,This is the adult swim version which means (uncut). Yu Yu Hakusho got good right after the four saint beast sagas then the show turn into more comedic and animation started to look more childish instead of anime. The action wasn't more mature that may be why adult swim stop airing it right after the saint beast episodes they should of kept it on a adult level. But still I like this set.,1118534400,4,389,4.342465753424658

It tells you everything about the spirit detective, the reason why he has been choosen for this mission and the gradual increasing of his capabilities and the difficulty of the missions he has to accomplish. I personally believe that it could not be any better !!",1110758400,2,289,4.576923076923077
