8256757,5,B0014ZUQVI,"I ride a single speed, and am a life long rider. i have never had a licence. so riding is a daily part of my life. given my love of riding i am always looking for bike related items, and mash has been my favorite aquisition. the video features a group of riders who each get a segment of the film lasting the duration of a song or two. the rides are excellent, each exihbiting the rider's skill, and the music is well selected to suit the ride. if you love to ride this is a video worth seeing, especially when you take into account that these riders are flying down san francisco's hills on fixed gears. something that takes nerve, skill, and experience. excellent dvd, i watch it at least once a week. highly recommended.",1273708800,2,723,4.323529411764706
8256758,5,B0014ZUQVI,"Simply put the DVD is amazing. It's riding at it's best and has inspired me to step my game up. It's a beautiful interpretation of a city from a riders point of view. The 120 page book is also fantastic. Great photography of the city, riders, and culture. I strongly recomend buying this DVD set.",1256342400,,296,4.4
8256759,4,B0014ZUQVI,"The Mash DVD is a great example of how to promote an active counter culture in cycling. It plays out the same way skate videos like ""Yeah, Right!"" play, with amazing looking footage, well framed shots, snappy editing all blended into an artful end package that makes half your brain want to keep on watching, and the other half want to get on your bike and go bombing down the nearest steep hill at top speed. Top marks for being a solid representation of bike culture in the 21st century.

A Few things that get me thinking though are a matter of production. The truth of the matter is though enough time was put into this it seems, that with just a little more emphasis on interviews and b-roll of the sort, it could be edited to make a solid documentary about the history of the SF bike scene and what it means for the development as a city as a whole. In other words it could be made accessible to people who don't know anything about cycling. The end result as is, can be interpreted as just a video showing off the skills of one particular team, and if that sort of thing doesn't interest you than it just isn't going to get you to sit down for an hour and watch.

That one complaint however is overshadowed by the fact that the packaging is effing sweet. 120 pages of gorgeous photos and written interviews from the riders in the video.

All in all this is a really good example of an alternative sport type video, with enough artistic flair that it would entice someone with just enough of an attention span to watch an hours worth of high speed bicycling footage set to a relatively awesome soundtrack.",1243468800,,1611,4.381270903010034
8256760,4,B0014ZUQVI,"My boyfriend rides a fixie and this is the first dvd/book he has bought on cycling. He has watched the video more times than I can count and looks through the book all the time. I was impressed with the cinematography...after a while I realized that someone was actually shooting the footage and had to ride with the messengers and avoid the same dangers. The music is also great and would definitely reccomend this product to anyone in the cycling community, riders, messengers, enthusiasts, etc. I would not reccomend for anyone who doesn't want their cyclist (boyfriend, girlfriend, brother, sister, son, daughter) getting pumped up and going out to try new things on the roads of their city, because that is exactly what it did for mine. ;)",1229385600,6,744,4.8203125
