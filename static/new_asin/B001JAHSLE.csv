3654008,5,B001JAHSLE,"I loved this show when I was a kid, and have had Season 1 for a few years now... When is Season 2 going to be released? Even though I've long since realized that the situations in this show are nothing like real education, Mr. Kotter's classroom, the jokes of the students - the whole atmosphere of the show made me feel very warm inside.",1318464000,5,338,4.2153846153846155
3654009,5,B001JAHSLE,"This is the season I remember most vividly, since I watched them as they debuted.  One of my favorites in this season is the Sadie Hawkins dance, in which Vinnie is too proud to accept a date (listen for Mr. Kotter's classic story of Bonzo Marretti's kid sister Betty). Horshack gets his shining moment as he doesn't show up for school after the other Sweathogs have laughed at his acting in a school play, then tries to make something of himself (he's the only Sweathog whose family you got to meet). Epstein falls for Mr. Kotter's sister-in-law (and Mrs. Kotter reacts the same way Juan does when Horshack has a crush on his sister!). Washington gets accused of stealing the student council's treasury money.  Horshack tries standing up to bully Carvelli. A volatile gym coach physically punishes Barbarino for acting up in gym class (he especially doesn't appreciate his ""What?"" ""Where?"" routine). Epstein takes up smoking (listen for Mr. Kotter's potato gnish story). A student teacher is brought in and not exactly given the red carpet treatment by the others. Washington becomes a radio star after a field trip.  All the Sweathogs try to help a bum out for Christmas (and we find out that Santa Claus isn't a big fan of Mr. Kotter's uncle jokes!).  All 5 of them (Gabe and Sweathogs)get locked in a museum on a field trip (Barbarino laments ""I'm so confuuuuused!"" and Horshack wishes he got the chance to meet Marie Osmand!). And at home, Mr. Kotter's wife Julie is pregnant, so in addition to dealing with his adopted sons, a goofball, a stud, a hipster and a wiseguy who's often late for class, he's going to be a real-life father.  This carries on into Season 3.",1254700800,8,1671,4.708904109589041
3654030,5,B001JAHSLE,"Love this show!  John Travolta took us back to a time when life was simpler for high school students, and when teachers were more involved in their student's life.",1430611200,,163,4.620689655172414

3654037,4,B001JAHSLE,"I got mine today before the release date (from another seller) and the picture quality is really good for a 70s show.  The first 2 seasons are the only seasons worth owning and I will be stopping at this one(I have no interest in the box set).  It's too bad it took 8 years for this to come out after the release of the first season.  There will probably be grumbling about no closed-captions.  There are captions but you have to use it through your TV, not the DVD menu itself.",1421452800,,478,4.21978021978022

8312382,5,B001JAHSLE,"I think with a lot of shows the first two seasons are enough. Several reasons to watch a show from yesteryear, and Kaplan's opening and closing segments have a warmth to them. It is surprising to see what a strong character Horshack was. We remember him as funny, but he has a much stronger presence than I remember.",1437609600,,316,4.4655172413793105
