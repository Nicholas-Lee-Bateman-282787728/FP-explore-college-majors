8120802,5,B000FCEMUW,"Love, intrigue, betrayal and a happy ending wrapped in a lovely melodies of Imre Kalman - what else can you ask from operetta? I fell in love with this movie as a child and it have been a life -long love affair. And while Georg Ots(Mister X) may be not the best of actors,there is no denial that his beautiful, effortless baritone is a pleasure to listen to. The supporting cast, including Grigorij Yaron is wonderful. This is charming, delightful piece of nostalgia and one of the best versions of Kalman's operetta's ever put on the screen. So, if you love music of Kalman and do not mind that the soundtrack is in Russian only (no subtitles) - do yourself a favour and get this DVD and not an insipid, graceless 1982 re-make.",1348704000,,728,4.481203007518797
