498284,2,6302682576,"Ida Lupino tries really hard to inject some life and energy into this story of two brothers who fall in love with the same woman.  Lupino is the poor single mother who loves one of the brothers, Errol Flynn, a free spirit who composes music.  Gig Young is the other brother, and rich girl Eleanor Parker is the object of both brothers' affections.  The story is too complicated to summarize in a few sentences, with the locale shifting across Europe.  However, the story is never credible, and neither are the actors.  Flynn was no longer cutting much of a dashing figure by this point in his career, and he brings no depth or conviction to the character at all.  Parker never seems like the type of woman who could inspire anything, while Young barely registers as the other brother.  Lupino goes for it, as she did with pretty much every performance, but with this script and ill-defined character, there's not much she can do than appear continually overwrought.  By the half way mark of the movie, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them.  There is some good music, but the story and characters do not flow nearly as well as the orchestrations.  This film is a disappointment.",1019260800,5,1196,4.625592417061611
498285,2,6302682576,"It's not a comedy but if you don't laugh, you will be wondering why you continued to sit through this till the very end. Errol Flynn carried this film most of the way with his usual charm but even he can't perform lazarus on such a bad written screenplay. Peter Godfrey didn't help either. Perhaps he had fallen asleep while directing this piece. Having said that, it has a great cast of actors and actresses. Lupino is a good actress but I felt she was badly miscast in this film. What a pity though because the idea was good and it had potential.",999043200,5,548,4.330097087378641
498286,1,6302682576,"Despite the impassioned tribute to Elisabeth Bergner below, this is not the little heartbreaker's version of this particular story. In this glossy Warners remake, the adorable little gamine is played by Ida Lupino, who  scampers about in what has to be her worst performance. This is one of the  duds (""Never Say Goodbye"" and ""Cry Wolf"" are the  others) that Errol Flynn made in the late forties trying to extend his  range, and which instead killed off his career as a major star. Don't even  think about buying it.",958780800,3,516,4.752808988764045
498287,5,6302682576,"I think this is one of Errol Flynn's greatest movies.  He first makes you love his character, hate his character, then in the end allows you to forgive.  I recommend this movie highly.  Forget Me Never is sappy, but it  is sappy in a good way.  You laugh, you cry and before you know it, the  movie is over.  It has a complete storyline that is on the same level as  The Adventures of Robin Hood.",940809600,7,396,4.118421052631579

7829811,1,6302682576,"There is a reason you never heard of this movie; it starts with a poor storyline and continues downhill with Ida Lupino as a young widow in love with Errol Flynn the poor but immeasurably talented composer you never heard of who can't figure out that Lupino desperately loves him, even though she follows him around Europe.  Meanwhile Eleanor Parker is a beautiful aristocrat who would give up all to follow Flynn.  Definitely not recommended for ""golden oldie"" fans",1458000000,3,466,4.886075949367089

7829813,3,6302682576,"This has the reputation of being a real stinker, and it is, but not on account of casting or production . The latter is quite handsome, some awfully tired back-projection aside, and the leads put best foot forward. It's the material. Pee-yew. Truly lousy, fatuous flourishes in place of a script. Why the devil can't screenwriters deal with art and music without resorting to such ""lofty"" hogwash? There's a thesis in that for somebody smarter than yours truly.
  The leads do their damnedest, with Lupino womanfully shouldering the heaviest lifting. She shouldn't have had to, but never shirks nor behaves as if the material were beneath her, nor do Parker nor Flynn. Parker already exhibits her purposeful allure and elegance, and Flynn proves yet again what a subtle and sensitive player he was.  The score, another Korngold horror, matches the script in overblownness, without a cliche left uncloyed, nor a memorable phrase to its name,  but relentless in its banality none the less. Indeed one wonders if the film's name might itself not accuse its composer, who ever-so-audibly never gave ear to the power of silence.  hfs",1408924800,4,1128,5.010695187165775
7829814,5,6302682576,"I saw this movie the wee hour of the morning on turner classics and just loved it. Lately I have become a complete Errol Flynn fan
and loved Ida Lupino. This movie also includes Eleanor Parker who I also love & Gig Young in his early 20's. I would definitely recommend this movie.",1372118400,7,280,4.30188679245283
7829815,4,6302682576,"Ok, ok. I'm in the minority here, but I loved this film! Watching it brought out my emotional side. I cried and cried and cried. I thought Errol Flynn and Ida Lupino were great. Though reviewers mock the weak screenplay and melodramatic acting, I thought the film was sweet and very enchanting!

Flynn and Lupino were the best of friends before the making of this film. Yet during its filming, they became romantically involved, which I thought played so well for the characters they portrayed. There was a spark between them that was undeniable! Lupino herself said that ""the extra gleam in her eyes"" was due in part to her off-set fling with Flynn.

Eleanor Parker was beautiful and her counterpart, Gig Young, were both decent in their supporting roles. The spotlight, however, does shine brightly on its two major stars. The ending is a little unsatisfying, though. The epiphany of Flynn's character is disbelieving; he didn't do much groveling for my taste! Throughout much of the film he acts horrid and irresponsible. However, he's forgiven albeit a little too easily!

""Escape Me Never"" is not highly regarded as their best picture, but I still think it's worth a shot. If you're a softie like me, then you'll be crying your eyes out. As a testament, my eyes are still stinging hot and dry from all the tears I've shed. Also, there's wonderful music as well with some very romantic pieces by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.",1181606400,21,1424,4.8040816326530615
7829816,4,6302682576,"This is an intriguing and beguiling Errol Flynn film. Errol Flynn puts the viewer through a gamut of emotions and flexing loyalties for his character. Perhaps a flawed film, it remains intriguing for what Errol Flynn did with his character. Errol Flynn demonstrates a great range of histrionics and an unusual and much deeper talent for his craft.",1142899200,3,347,5.0
7829817,3,6302682576,"This film is underated. Although I must admit that the script is a little dumb, on the comdemy that is, it was filmed well and the sets do not look fake, although they are. What I do not understand is why Flynn goes from Lupino to Parker and back again. He eyes most of the women in the picture, that is not really bad but it shows what we all think he was. The profomances are excellent and the cast is great. The Ballet is good and the Korngold score is a real plus! Malton should have given it ** out of ****.",1111622400,6,512,3.9805825242718447
