5774746,2,B00D4Q1UWO,this movie is so anticlimactic. the budget for this movie must have been around $300.,1438387200,,85,4.733333333333333
5774747,2,B00D4Q1UWO,"My favorite scenes were the minor league baseball scenes near the beginning. My least favorite scenes were almost all of the rest. They weren't terrible, but I just cant think of any satisfying or memorable moments. Hitting the Cycle pops out.",1422489600,,243,4.951219512195122

5774750,3,B00D4Q1UWO,Started and stopped watching it a couple of times. It does not grab my interest. The lead character is so so in performance and so far it is moving at to slow a pace.,1463270400,,166,3.911764705882353

5774753,3,B00D4Q1UWO,Very slow moving movie but good. Would have liked to see more of the relationship develop between Sam and Jim.,1455926400,,110,4.55
5774754,3,B00D4Q1UWO,"Hitting The Cycle was OK, but there were far too many low points and not enough high.  I was looking forward to an entertaining baseball story, but 15 minutes into the movie the star player gets released from his team and it goes downhill from there.  Richey Nash, or (Rip) is played in the movie as an angry man who is a baseball star, but started to have problems and was released from the league.  He is also drunk for much of the movie just as his father was, who is dying in a hospital room from a liver problem.

He doesnt want to be associated with his father, James Ripley played by Bruce Dern, because he believes that he ruined his life while in High School.  Rip Jr. got into some trouble just before the High School State Champion baseball game, and he believes that it was his father that reported him to the school, who ended up banning him from the State Championship game.

I didn't enjoy seeing all of the low points and almost turned it off, but stuck it out.  I did like co-star Courtney Henggeler who played Samantha, a nurse and Rips classmate from High School, although I would have liked to see that relationship go a bit further than it did, even though it was implied at the end of the movie.  The last picture below is the last 5 seconds of the movie!

All in all I give the movie a 3 stars, or a grade of B-.",1451174400,,1335,4.203921568627451
5774755,5,B00D4Q1UWO,"Great feel good movie.  I enjoyed the story and the happy ending -even though some parts were tear jerkers.  A fun evening of entertainment.  The acting was decent and not too predictable.  Family friendly for the most part (teens and older children), although it did center on a lot of drinking (showing the negative consequences such as liver failure),  Worth watching!",1448064000,,371,5.016393442622951

5774759,3,B00D4Q1UWO,A drunken ballplayer is released from a minor league team and returns to his hometown where he chats with his brother. The past is talked about and seen in flashbacks. He argues with his sick dad. He gets to do some coaching while he aspires to date a former classmate. The classmate's babysitter hits on him. Unlikeable character to watch. It has a good message but not easy to watch.,1442966400,,385,4.514285714285714
