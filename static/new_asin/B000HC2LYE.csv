8138241,5,B000HC2LYE,"Sarah Carey is just the best!  I think she should have her own TV show.  She's a good, down to earth (formally trained) chef who is entertaining and informative to watch. I judge a cooking show/cook by how inspiring they are to me, how much their cooking work makes me want to go cook - and Sarah Carey always does.  She deserves a bigger role in Martha Stewart's empire!  Many people miss Everyday Food, magazine and TV show, and I'm one of them. It was great; this DVD is part of that.",1422835200,,487,4.260869565217392
