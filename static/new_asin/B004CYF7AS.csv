4329963,5,B004CYF7AS,This is just a fun video.  It is very interesting to see how the cast relates to each other in such a different way.,1358294400,,116,3.8333333333333335
4329964,5,B004CYF7AS,Definitely worth the watch even if you are very familiar with the show and its concept.  It allows you to get a back door glimpse of the actors behind the characters and how they approach their work.  Simon often looks like he is somewhat disengaged on the stage but springs to life when he has something to say.  They really caught him when someone from the audience asked him if he had planned the boob-grab of Grace during the blind episode.  He owned up beautifully.,1357862400,,470,4.4941176470588236
4329965,4,B004CYF7AS,"This is very informal and shows the cast as real people instead of their characters. I wouldn't recommend it for those who are looking for great insights, but it is a good look at the ideas behind ""The Mentalist,"" it's creators and cast.",1356048000,,237,4.534883720930233
4329966,2,B004CYF7AS,This dvd is very expensive for what you get. The cast looks uncomfortable to be there. The first half is mostly the moderator gushing. There are only a few audience questions. I am sorry that I bought this for a gift for a person who loves the show. They were dissapointed.,1341187200,2,273,4.372549019607843
4329967,5,B004CYF7AS,"This is not a high quality video in terms of production. However, as a Mentalist fan I found it extremely interesting. Simon Baker is naturally entertaining, which helps explain why he is such a good actor. I love that he brings his mom along on these things (even got her a bit part in ""The Affair of the Necklace"") and seems to love acknowledging her presence. Very endearing. The other cast members were also interesting to listen to, especially Robin Tunney. She has a very lively personality.",1337731200,2,497,4.724137931034483
4329968,3,B004CYF7AS,"Here's my suggestion if you're a fan but a bit cheap.  Watch it instantly ($1.99) as opposed to buying the disk.

The conversation is enjoyable and well worth watching but hard-core fans will leave unsatisfied.  First, the program appears to have been taped after the first season but before the second, so there are a number of sub-plots (Rigsby and Van Pelt's relationship and Lisbon's one-night stand) that had been filmed but very consciously not referred to.  There's no discussion of the subtleties of character development, the balance between Patrick's Jane's charm and (sometimes) annoying arrogance nor most of the other story telling features that make the show pretty sophisticated and standing above what it might have been if the writing and character development weren't so advanced.  This would have been much better if taped after the second season and even more so after the third.  There would be far more to discuss.

The cast, particularly Tunney and Yeoman, are really charming and funny and Heller is a wonderful nerd.

If you hadn't already figured it out, you'll learn the make of the car Patrick Jane drives.

If you're a fan you'll find this well worth your time, you'll enjoy it but understand that if taped at another time you'd enjoy it more. Hopefully there's be another cast interview available on disk.",1310774400,6,1335,4.9774774774774775
4329969,5,B004CYF7AS,"I was a bit skeptical at first, because usually those interview things are often pretty boring and technical. And at first glance, the product description of only about an hour's worth of video seemed a bit offputting as well. But boy was I proved wrong.

This is a very nice video of a very rare thing: An interview session with a cast that was FUN to watch and not only gave great insight into the background of the show, but also showed the awesome chemistry between the cast members. First you get about half an hour of questions by the host, which are clever and not just the usual run of the mill (particularly watch out for Simon defending himself by saying ""Mate, it was the early 90s....!"", it's a riot!!LOL). Then the audience gets to ask questions for another roughly 20 minutes, and there are some sweet moments as well.

This is one interview session I will be watching more than once, in fact I've already seen it five times now and it doesn't become boring at all.

All in all, I was definitely not dissapointed by this DVD, it's worth every penny and amazon did a great job as well when they manufactured the DVD, it played perfectly (even on a German DVD player).

My vote: A full two thumbs up!",1299542400,14,1212,4.42152466367713
4329970,3,B004CYF7AS,"As a big fan of 'The Mentalist' I expected a little more for my money.  Listening to the writer and producer talking about the creation of the show and the different characters is interesting, but I felt a lack of in-depth questions, the same old questions that come up in every interview with the actors about the  show. In fact the best questions were the ones asked by the audience at the very end (should of had more of them...).",1294444800,6,433,4.4

4330010,5,B004CYF7AS,A great insight into the show. And why we loved it so much.,1431648000,,59,3.6153846153846154

4330013,2,B004CYF7AS,"I love The Mentalist and the actors here, as always, did their best.  The host, however, was dreadful.  I'm surprised none of the actors said anything about his horrible questions.  Tragic waste of a great opportunity.",1425686400,,218,5.0
4330014,4,B004CYF7AS,"As The Mentalist comes to a close this season, looking at this early cast interview is so great! Yes, some of the questions are fluffy, especially some of the audience questions which are downright silly but Simon Baker's reaction to the Hugh Jackman question is hilarious. You do see that early chemistry between the actors, especially Simon and Robin Tunney. I wish there was a follow-up to this interview in a later season but that's what the PaleyFest does, it captures a snapshot of a hit show early in its life and I'm glad we have this to look back on. Biggest disappointment is that there is no Tim Kang (Agent Cho) which is why I gave it a 4. Its interesting to hear their opinions on the Jane/Lisbon and Rigsby/VanPelt relationships. In all, if you are a fan of the show, its worth a watch if for nothing more than watching Simon Baker play with a water bottle.",1419552000,,871,4.484276729559748
4330015,3,B004CYF7AS,"I'm a big fan of the show, but I was a bit disappointed in this item.  Didn't like the interviewer.  He spent too much time on the non-actors.  Disappointed Tim Kang wasn't there.  On the positive side, loved Simon Baker speaking up on many issues.  Amanda Righetti hardly spoke at all--perhaps shy.  It was a good discounted price, so it was worth it to me, but otherwise not worth the full price.  Love the show--can't wait for the new season to start (major time delay).  This usually means it won't be back again.  Have every show on tape.  This is a nice addition to my collection.",1412294400,,586,4.443396226415095
4330016,4,B004CYF7AS,"Very interesting to see my favorite characters in ""real life"".  Check out the accents.  I learned a lot about the show from this feature.",1409443200,,137,4.666666666666667
4330017,2,B004CYF7AS,"Combine a poor interviewer with rambling answers and cast members who seemed to want to be somewhere else, and you get a two-star production",1395964800,,140,4.875
4330018,4,B004CYF7AS,"If you love The Mentalist you will want to watch this.  I don't think the questions were very good and the cast seemed to be a little uncomfortable. If you love Simon Baker you will enjoy his comments plus his back and forth with Robin Tunney.
You can see why they are so engaging on the show. Amanda Rigetti and Owain Yeoman don't have too much to say, but they're cute too!",1394928000,,375,4.208333333333333
4330035,5,B004CYF7AS,Very good overview of inside look at cast and writers.  One of the best of the Pauley center productions we have watched. Would recommend.,1391472000,,138,4.75
4330036,4,B004CYF7AS,"Bruno is such a gifted  writer and I wanted to see why he chose to write for mainstream television.  The cast is pretty well chosen and I do enjoy the series.  Not so brutal as ""Rome"" which was inspired but left me a bit queasy.  I'm not sure about recommending this dvd since it  was made a long time before the series became so popular around the world. It was well done although the moderator was a bit giggly.",1388361600,,413,4.177215189873418
4330037,3,B004CYF7AS,"I Just watched this tonight and found it very entertaining and loved listening to the fine cast talk about the series up to the date
of the show.  I only gave it three stars because it was a bit dated, either after the 3rd season or early into the fourth.  Still I would
recommend it to Castleoids like myself (and I did) to get an idea of how the actors-actresses are in real life.  I would recommend to
ABC studios (where the hell are they?) to put on one of  these at the conclusion of each season, sometime early summer.  It would
make for some very interesting things to talk about.  Otherwise it was fine.  All the important cast members were there though I
am not a fan of ""Martha"".  They seemed to  suggest that if Castle and Beckett get married that Martha the Moocher will continue
to live there in the Loft.  Bad Idea.  It is not good to have an in-law living with the married couple. particularly newlyweds.  Especially
a mother-in-law like Martha.  Martha should move Washington DC, marry Dr Sweets and disappear from the planet.
 But everyone else there was just fine.  So I do recommend it.  I did purchase this from AMAZON.",1386892800,,1139,4.456310679611651
4330038,5,B004CYF7AS,"This video was made four years ago but I had never seen it in its entirety until I stumbled across it recently.  I enjoyed it immensely because Bruno Heller and all the cast members joined in the conversation.  They were very entertaining with stories of onset pranks and I could see the camaraderie they had after just one season.  I'm a big fan of Simon Baker's work and I enjoyed seeing him in a group setting.  He was good-natured about the teasing the other cast members gave him and I thought it was very sweet of him to acknowledge his mother in the audience.  I enjoyed the audience questions and comments too, so I would recommend this video to any fans of The Mentalist and Simon Baker.  It's in my video library and I will watch it over and over. I wish they would do this again.",1382313600,,790,4.340136054421769

4330044,5,B004CYF7AS,"Enjoy the comraderie between the cast members.  Great to get to see and hear the discourse and exchange between the writers, directors, producers, and of course the actors.  I love this series!!",1361836800,,194,5.03125
8423799,2,B004CYF7AS,"The problem with these Paley center cast interviews is usually the interviewer. The shows already have a fan base and quality or they wouldn't get an invitation. The productions are substantial enough as well so there is no shortage of content to discuss. The material and the actors and creators are inherently interesting to the audience and it is already exciting and unusual to have these type of people in a long form serious interview. Consequently, where the f do they get these interviewers? They are almost without exception bad. One interviewer seemed completely uninformed, or barely, about the show she was interviewing on in one of the other paley episodes.
This interviewer is not funny, is a smart ass, and has a weird manufactured high energy about him that is completely unnecessary and awkward. And by the way, did he actually slap Simon Baker on the ass as Baker was finishing shaking hands with him and walking away? Interesting to see that in the current environment of December 2017.
So rarely do I actually watch one of these cast interviews all the way through as much as I would want to because of this pervasive flaw.
The only one worse is the guy who is the after show interviewer for the new start trek show. He is an unmitigated disaster.",1514419200,,1267,4.737556561085973
