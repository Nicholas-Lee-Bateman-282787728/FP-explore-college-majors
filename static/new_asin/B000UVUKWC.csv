I was able to play however the Nutcracker in my computer. I am not a ballet nut but if I compare the quality of dancing of this ballet group vs the Bolchoi that I had already, the Bolchoi, which is 10 dollars is superior!. I have a 3 year old and she definetly enjoy more the Bolchoi ballet more than this one. Obviously, the bolchoi is simpler in decoration but superior in choreography and dance.",1317859200,,554,4.091743119266055
