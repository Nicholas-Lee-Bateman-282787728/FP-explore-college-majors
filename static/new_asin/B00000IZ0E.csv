8609221,5,B00000IZ0E,"Back in the 90s they made a cartoon series called ""Legends of Treasure Island"" in the United Kingdom,  which ran for two series, each series being 13 episodes long. This DVD contains a movie version of this show, which was made by editing four episodes together from series 1 (Episodes 1,2,3 and 13 - The Quest Begins, Memories Are Made of This, The Watch Tower and The Beginning of the End). The cartoon is well written and superbly animated. It was one of my favourite cartoons of the 90s in my younger years and watching it now it's still excellent fun.

The movie's picture quality is okay but sadly no restoration has been done, so it is showing its age. There are no special features but there is one bit of good news - they did make the DVD region free so everyone in the world can watch it. As this is the only DVD release of the show currently (at time of writing this at least) this is a very good thing.

I dream of he unlikely day they release all of this show on DVD, but until they do, this DVD is a treasure from the past that I highly recommend buying. Whether it is to relive your childhood memories of the show or entertain your own kids with a great bit of story telling and animation that you too might well enjoy, this DVD is well worth the purchase.",1398556800,2,1271,4.243801652892562
