4009917,5,B002XTBE60,"This movie is very good despite the poor reviews. I thought the acting was very believable as well as the story. The story was simple and seriously done, which to me was refreshing. I am so tired of martial arts movies with elaborate plots that end up leaving you more confused than when the movie started. To me martial arts movies tend to get too bogged down with heavy plot and cheapen the action. This was not the case with this film. Instead the director seem focus on the action and choreography and keep the story concise enough the keep the audience engaged. I thought this was the best movie about the Ninja I have ever seen, however, the new Ninja Assassin movie has not come out yet on Blu-ray. At least when it does I will have something to compare it to.",1265155200,17,767,4.370629370629371
4009918,1,B002XTBE60,"I have been a martial arts movie fan for a long time and watched my share of good and bad movies. I rented this movie last night at blockbuster. What a waste of time and money! Didn't even watch the whole thing because it was that ridiculous. The first 45 minutes were enough, 45 minutes of my life I won't get back. Horrible acting, tired plot, martial art scenes were just plain stupid. Low budget b-movie effects. When a person gets shot from the front the bullet doesn't cause the clothing to blow out in the opposite direction of the impact. When the outcast ninja returns to the school you have one ninja defeat a whole school of ninjas in 10 seconds and the master  in less than 5, COME ON! The hero and heroin rent a hotel room and both jump in the shower with their clothes on to get clean, how stupid is that. They could have filmed that scene in a different way or not at all. And the choreography made it look like each move was stop motion. Ridiculous thing like this happen throughout the whole movie. Don't waste your time or money.",1264291200,8,1047,4.314720812182741
4009919,4,B002XTBE60,"I didn't know what to expect when I started to watch this movie. I mean, a movie called ninja. I was hoping it was not all in subtitles. I was lucky and it was not. There were some parts with sub titles. But don't worry. They did not speed by so fast that someone couldn't read them. The movie is about a man who is in a school for martial arts. After his dad died and his mom left him at this school when he was a child, he stayed in the school. Time comes to choose a new head in the school. Another man attending the school is jealous. During a spar he gets a real sword and tries to kill the man. He is banned from ever coming back to the school. Then, he comes back. There is a sword and a special box. The box has items in it that are rare and mean a lot to the people who went to the school. The man who tried to kill the other student wants the box. The young man who was almost killed is sent to protect the box. That's the story. It is cheesy and the acting is just ok. But, the reason that I will be buying this when it is available is the fighting. WOW! This was some of the best and coolest fighting I have ever seen in a movie. I mean scenes that have a man cut someone with a sword and blood just squirts all over the place. Don't worry though, it is not super bloody and meant to make you sick. It almost seems real when you are watching. For an actor I have never heard of, the man sure can fight. I will be happy to add this movie to my collection and even happier to see the main actor in more movies. For any fans of martial arts movies, this is a must see!",1264204800,13,1577,3.8404907975460123
4009920,4,B002XTBE60,"I just saw this movie and totally recomend it to all you ninja and martial arts fans!!! Some great camara work, awesome choreography, very nice action scenes, a good rivalry and the story isn't half bad. For those of you who might want more story detail, don't expect any twists its a simple story of 2 men at odds, one of them has something the other wants and won't stop at nothing to attain. Sure it has its problems, mainly the cult that the bad ninja works for and police ethics... The acting isn't going to win any Academy Awards but the actors all do good work with the material they had, I'm interested in seeing what they do next.
Bottom line: Movie kicks major ass and does it well, action fans rejoice.",1263945600,15,713,4.368421052631579
4009921,4,B002XTBE60,"James McTeigue's ""Ninja Assassin,"" the Wachowski Brothers, Hollywood backed big budget Ninja flick was a ridiculously over the top, and stylish take more on the mythology of ninjas and the supposed mystical abilities they had than it was about those behind the dark mask and shadows. It was violent, bloody, and just plain awesome. After watching Ninjas in anime and videogames melt into shadows and perform ninjutsu (ninja magic) or whatever it's referred to in said media, it was great to see it brought to life here in America. Previously all we had was ""Shinobi: Heart Under Blade,"" which is a great movie and should definitely be checked out. ""Assassin"" is visceral and just plain fun.

That said I was also looking forward to the lesser known and much smaller budgeted ""Ninja"" starring Scott Adkins and directed by Isaac Florentine. Both are mostly unknown to the world but both have been around for a bit using their martial arts backgrounds to get some decent direct-to-disc action films out. Adkins a amazing martial artist in his own right, hails from Britain and has most recently been seen as the fight and stunt double for Weapon XI in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" and will appear reprising his role Uri Boyka in ""Undisputed 3."" Florentine is an Israeli born director who has directed martial artists Michael Jai White, and Jean Claude Van Damme in his films that include ""Undisputed 2,"" and ""The Sheppard: Border Patrol,"" respectively.

That opening was to illustrate the major difference between ""Ninja"" and ""Assassin."" While ""Assassin"" eschews its 80's roots for a modern yet mythical angle, ""Ninja"" stays firmly entrenched in its 80's roots. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. First let's start with the good. Scott Adkins is underrated as a martial artist, as is his co-star from ""Undisputed 2,"" Michael Jai White. In ""Ninja"" Adkins plays the role of Casey Bowman, an American raised at a Japanese dojo run by the last surviving descendant of the Koga Ninja Clan. The story is simple and to the point. Sometimes to the detriment of the film, but again, it's a throwback and I think Florentine consciously made it such. After the other top student at the school is expelled, he returns sometime later to stake his claim as the next Soke (teacher/leader) of the school and protector of the Yoroi Bitsu, the last remaining artifacts of the Koga Clan. The chest is sent to New York to keep it from Masazuka, who kills his former teacher trying to get to it.

What works for the film is its minimalistic approach to the work. Much like ""American Ninja"" before it, this story gives us an American (British) protagonist who grew up studying the ways of the ninja. Much like those films before this, Casey isn't wearing a Ninja suit for most of the film and much of his adventure takes place during the day and he's fighting gangsters and thugs. This film does a great job of showing off Adkins' skills. There are two fight scenes in particular that are top notch, and the editing and multiple angles really sell his moves. There are scenes where he starts a fight and the camera is facing him as he dispatches his adversaries, but as he spins to kick an attacker approaching from behind another camera catches the action from the new angle just before he connects. This isn't the film, cut, edit technique that most films use to make their star look more adept than they are. This was simply placing multiple cameras so that you can catch the action from as many angles that would allow you to make a fluid fight scene. No behind the back, cut to close ups here. Masazuka has an incredible, but all too short standoff in the rain early in the film that has some cool camera work too. It zooms in and out kinetically and allows you to get right up on the action and zooms out just in time to see the broader picture.

I mentioned before ""ninja"" was a more realistic look at the ninja, albeit realistic in a ""no shadow melting"" way. One thing I really liked was Masazuka's gear (seen on the cover of the DVD) which is basically modern ninja gear, including night vision visor, grapnel gun, and fire arms. Yes I said fire-arms. I didn't much care for it (if you're a ninja shouldn't the guns at least be silenced) but hey it works for the character as he really has no honor. Of course this sets up the traditional versus the modern fight at the end but hey it was still very cool to see. Though ""Ninja"" may be 80's inspired it did make some improvements to what in emulated. The day scenes were pretty sparse and short and not much action happened during them and was mostly indoors. They actually had night scenes, though they were brightly lit. And the choreography was great

On the other side of things, the low budget diminished the scope of the film and really limited what could be done. The sets were obviously backlots, and being from NYC I could tell during the rooftop scenes that they had no idea where in the city they wanted this to take place, despite their labeling each place at the beginning of scenes. It seems like the whole film took place within a ten block radius. The chase scene in the middle of the movie starts in the exact same spot the climax of the movie happens. The dialogue was rather bad, and all supporting characters were cardboard.

The female lead is also a student at the ninja school, and even bested Casey with a staff during practices, and yet she gets tossed around like a ragdoll. I mean yeah she gets a punch in here, and a kick in there, and is just dangerous wielding a crutch, but seriously she's just a damsel in distress. It's like she there for Casey to get angry about and whoop some ass. Lastly and most importantly are the plot issues. There are several that just made my head hurt, but the biggest was the introduction of an Illuminati like group, who seemed to have an endless number of hooded thugs to send after Casey. It was like a video game at some parts with these guys just coming out of the woodworks. How do they track this guy? They just always know exactly where to go.

Plot aside I wasn't going into this looking for Oscar worthy performances and big budget awe. I went into this looking for something to take me back to the world of the Ninja just like when I was a kid. And I was not disappointed. Scott Adkins carries the torch that Michael Dudikof lit many years ago, and he carries it well. I'm hoping Hollywood notices this guy, as he'd be great for ""Iron Fist"" or the character of Roper in that ""Enter The Dragon"" remake I keep hearing about. So as long as you're just looking for some decent martial arts wrapped in a cheesy but yummy 80's candy shell ""Ninja"" is for you.",1259625600,8,6664,4.548333333333333

4009964,5,B002XTBE60,"As a  lifetime student of numerous martial arts and a lover of martial art books and movies I have seen countless martial art movies.  Some were bad, some were good, and several were great.  I had never seen this movie (Ninja starring Scott Adkins, Tsuyoshi with a cameo of the great Karate master Fumio Demura) until yesterday and I admit I did not expect much, but was I ever wrong.  The martial arts scenes were absolutely fantastic. They were authentic showing numerous types of arts such as Kenjutsu, Jujutsu, Sai Jutsu, Karate, Judo, and tons of other Japanese systems.  If you are seeking more martial art fight action scenes rather than just dialog this movie is for you.

It is true the story is not very original, but the action was truly non-stop all the way throughout the movie from beginning to end.  This movie ranks in my own personal top ten of best martial arts movies.  If you are seeking an authentic and action packed marital arts movie you should check out this one.  I personally loved this movie and look forward to watching it again.

4010122,1,B002XTBE60,"A complete waste of time.

It had a plot...protect ""the box"". Everything else was rather lame. The fight sequences were lame and tired. The American ""ninja"" was muscular, but seemed as dumb as a block of wood. The love interest, whose father was the expert of all experts, could not fight her way out of a paper bag despite having been trained in Ninja stuff her entire life! Did I mention how bad the fighting was? In one scene, the American battles the bad guys for at least 5 minutes without seriously hurting any of them (they kept getting back in the fight, so how bad could it have been?). However, in the major fight scene where he breaks into enemy HQ (spoiler alert) he fights 20 guys and knocks them all out in record time. Really?

Story - existed, but poor
Cinematography - poor
Action scenes - poor
Stunts - poor
Character development - poor
Bad guy - best part of whole movie...at least he was a Ninja",1402272000,,915,4.408284023668639

Ninja is a well crafted movie, traditional martial arts philosophy is depicted and serves as the vehicle for this well written story.
There are many fight sequences in this film as in Ninja 2, which is also part of my blu ray collection.
The fights are expertly choreographed and filmed using various camera shots, from in close, from above and in slow motion.
This film is one I will pull off the shelf and revisit in the future again and again.

However all of these seemingly negative aspects are overlooked, when considering the overall ninja quality of the movie. It keeps an authentic feeling of the ninja well contained within. Plus I think that the cinematography was really good. The action sequences have this like 'turbo-blaster' effect whenever our boy goes in for a kick to his enemies face that is pretty uplifting. It keeps things going with a nice driving sensation.

The bad guys are awesome in this movie. Its basically the idea of the foot clan from the ninja turtles. These dudes are crazy! they need to take in old boy alive so they can torture him into confessing where the chest in, and you'd think they wouldn't try to kill him, but they do- sending hundreds of hundreds of rounds from various small arms right at him. Fortunately for him, and them, his impeccable ninja moves keep him well protected from the bullets that are flying all around him.

Anyways the action is very much like early Jackie Chan movies without any of the funny stuff. The Protagonist Casey is buff. This dude has some muscles. Reminds me of when I was young. Well him and this other feller Matuzukawa or something like that have a beef. Matzukuwa is apparently jealous of Casey's muscular build and the fact that the other chicks at the Dojo like him.  Matszukuwa tries to kill him and he gets expelled by Sensei.  It fasts forward some years later and we some old dude named Temple running some sort of Satanic/Illuminati/Freemason thing out of his factory. The requirement to get in is wear a cheap leather jacket, a hoodie, and get branded with the Iron Cross on their chest. Ouch! Anyways this Temple feller is a bad ass using Materzukawa as his Assassin to knock off rivals which he does very nicely and gory. Well later on Matsukawaz shows back up at his old haunt drunk, stoned, or both trying to get the Yoroi Bitsu. A nice chest with some cool Ninja tools in it. His old Sensei tells him he's SOL and Matsukawasaki leaves. The Sensei gets Casey and the really good looking Chick to take the chest to New York.

4010362,3,B002XTBE60,"Just like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", this is just another film where some american director wanted to make an asian film, but in this case, some american white guy will play the lead role.

It says that Casey Bowman (Scott Adkins) was abandoned as a child and raised in Japan by the Sensei in the dujo (a live-in school of the Ninjitsu art of defense) but he still only speaks English and has no Japanese accent so that reduces the integrity of the film's authenticity just a little bit right there.

The main bad guy here, Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara), who was also raised in the dujo by the Sensei, for some reason just flips his lid and wants to hurt the american guy where he just loses his right to stay in the dujo to continue to study Ninjutsu. That was a truly unrealistic sacrifice for a life time student.

The Sensei entrusts the american born guy to go to New York to protect the encased weapons of the last Koja Ninja (why they are in New York, I'll never know). Anyway, most of the action to protect and to retrieve these weapons are basically a continued story done in New York City in which the New York Police Department just seems to just get in the way.

What helps to make this movie worth watching twice is the main hot asian babe in the film. Namiko (Mika Hijii) is a very beautiful young Japanese actress who has a sexy stare throughout the film where her beautiful black hair always seems to cover one eye. I kinda like that.

Anyway, for seven bucks, and this being a blu-ray, it's not too bad.",1380585600,,1512,4.347517730496454
4010363,1,B002XTBE60,"The story line was thin. Spoiler alert:

Anti-feminist. Sensei's daughter cowers and squeals when attacked?  Puhleeze.

Fight scenes were mainly gruesome but more campy than even being close to interesting.

 So many flaws so little time.

We laughed through most of this film.  Waste of time.",1379808000,,293,5.239130434782608
4010364,3,B002XTBE60,"Overall, this movie was a bit cartoonish, which I was expecting to a certain degree. The plot was an oldie but a goodie (spoiler alert): two rival ninja students are chosen as candidates to take over as ""Soke,"" master of the last and only modern-day Koga ninja school. During a duel, one of them does something stupid, so he gets kicked out and becomes an assassin.  Later, the expelled student comes back for revenge, and the remaining candidate and main character, Casey (played by Scott Adkins), must deal with him.  This is basically a re-run of 1981's ""Enter the Ninja.""

As a fighter, Adkins shows his props early on.  He's very muscular, flexible, fast, and an excellent martial arts performer.  Unfortunately, as a ninja, he's an absolute zero.  Adkins continually uses fancy, unarmed acrobatics and kicks in favor of the shrewd strategy, misdirection, tools, and trickery I would expect from someone about to take over a ninja dojo.

Tsuyoshi Ihara is probably the most fun to watch as the antagonist, Masazuka.  When we see him to go to work, he uses all the tricks of the trade, some of them with a modern twist.  His outfit was pretty snazzy, too.  The role was fairly two-dimensional, but he did a great job with what he had.  He also came across as more of a ninja, and less of a fighter, which I suppose made him a good opposite of the main character.  But rather than the intended overall theme of ""Honorable Ninja vs. Dishonorable Ninja,"" the message of the film for me was ""Tae Kwon Do vs. Ninja.""  Yes, Casey does finally uses some ninja weapons later on (shuriken and manriki-kusari), but still no clever strategy.

Mika Hijii plays the supporting role of Namiko, the current master's daughter.  Though easy on the eyes and a passable actress, don't expect her to open up a can of butt-whoopin' in any fight scenes. It was disappointing to see how poor her techniques were, or that she didn't even know how to hold an arrow. I believe she was cast to fill the role of ""damsel in distress,"" rather than live up to the character's full potential as a lifelong practitioner of her father's art.",1379721600,,2111,4.652291105121294

I don't agree with the other reviewers about the main female character- she deals plenty of kick-ass herself, but understanding fight mechanics, a 5-foot nothin' female fighter against many larger and brawnier males is gonna go down sooner or later. But not before she takes a few out herself. Plenty of action, lots of artful blood and combat. I do agree, there are quite a few inconsistencies in the movie (old style cellphones in a city that has flat-screen t.v.'s, a main character who has spent most of his formative years in a foreign country yet still sounds like he's from the Bronx, a bad guy who uses night vision while setting off flash-bangs (duh, idiot, you'll blind yourself), some secret Bilderberg-style evil group involved in world affairs, also run by idiots, stuff like that) but I wasn't watching this for the plot- I was watching it for the ACTION! Darned good when it is there, and it is there in spades. Don't give a damn about plot? That's a plus here. Just wanna see fountaining blood? Also a plus here. Body parts severed, yeah, so by now you know I'm a guy and this is what I wanted to see this time around. Doesn't hurt my pride at all to see some cute young thing kick some ass also. Would I watch it again? NO. But was it worth sitting down through the whole thing and was I on the edge of my seat during the action sequences? Well, most of the sequences? Definitely.

You want to see a ninja cut a man's arm off with his ninja sword and the man goes ""Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"" while blood spurts out of his stump, then this is the movie for you.

You want to see a stacked gravure idol as a dojo master's daughter who always needs to be saved just because she's a stacked gravure idol and even though she's a ninja, too, then this is the movie for you.

You want shurikens, poison blowgun darts, a ninja flying suit, and an SUV that rolls over and blows up spectacularly for NO FREAKING REASON, then this is the movie for you.

You want to see two ninjas have swordfight on the rooftop of a skyscraper with the Empire State Building in the background and you say, ""This is the most awesomest thing ever!"" in your best Peter Griffin voice, then babe, this is the ****ing movie for you.

You want sense? Read Jane ****ing Austen. You want ninjawesome, grab this baby, some chips and a Stella Artois and you're set for the night, brochacho.",1355788800,,1360,4.3478260869565215

4010454,3,B002XTBE60,"I don't know that I've ever encountered an action film with this long a list of both assets and liabilities.  So much to simultaneously revere and revile.  I'll try and keep my comments lean but I could describe factors from either category at great length.  The important thing to remember is that for a DTV release it's got some decent fights and looks pretty slick.  So if one doesn't enter this with high expectations a fun time should be had.

A young man named Casey (Scott Adkins, ""El Gringo"") has spent most of his life training in a Ninjutsu dojo after he was orphaned in Japan since adolescence.  His Sensei (Togo Igawa, ""The Last Samurai"") has picked him and fellow student Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") as his two best pupils and one will be given the title of the Sensei's rightful successor to protect and maintain some ancient Ninja weapons and carry on the school's tradition.  While Masazuka is a born native of Japan and the more advanced student, the Sensei senses anger, pride and ambition in him, whereas Casey is deeply dedicated and possesses the preferred humble demeanor.  During competition for the promotion, Masazuka tries to kill Casey, prompting the Sensei to permanently kick him out of the dojo, adding to Masazuka's painful emotional tapestry with feelings of resentment and abandonment.  Later, when the Sensei learns of Masazuka's new job as an assassin for hire (GREAT dental plan), he sends Casey and his daughter, Namiko (Mika Hijii), to New York City to hide the weapons from Masazuka.

As a fan of martial arts films, I had not looked forward to this as a Ninja flick so much as I had another collabortation between director Isaac Florentine and actor Scott Adkins.  Their ""Undisputed 2"" is one of the best DTV martial-arts films I've ever seen.  Luckily for me, I had heard several groans of disappointment from many a member of the fu-community before I finally got my hands on it.  Taking their complaints to heart I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.

While still pretty good, the fights could've been WAY better and have some awkward problems.  The biggest being that until the last 20 minutes of the movie, Casey seems inexplicably restrained.  He eventually goes through an entire building of the same goons he can barely handle 2 or 3 of in earlier confrontations.  Also, Namiko, the daughter of the Sensei and a lifelong ninja-practitioner, has great difficulty handling herself in several scuffles.

On the plus side, Tsuyoshi Ihara does a fine job as Masazuka in all required ways.  The Ninja sub-genre has never been my favorite (though I've seen plenty) so perhaps I'm not qualified to comment on the actual Ninjutsu but I thought that the scenes of him sneaking around wasting dudes was pretty sweet.  Nice mix of old and new weapons, too.  Mika Hijii as Namiko is sweet and cute and, despite her character's flaws, is a considerable step-up as the feminine 3rd wheel in an action flick.  There are also some interesting little visual nods to films like ""Sin City"" and the anime-favorite ""Ninja Scroll"".

The DVD has good widescreen picture quality and no special features.  Oh, well. I have seen this now several times and still like it a lot but to recommend it creates some hesitation.  It avoids some cliches and dives head-first into others and if it still interests you after all of that it's probably for you, assuming you can handle when members of a global-level ""secret"" society wear matching jackets.  3.5/5

4010456,3,B002XTBE60,"What do you expect from an action flick blatantly titled ""Ninja""? Sh Kosugi and those ninja movies made in the early '80s like ""Enter the Ninja""? Though a low-budget martial arts action ""Ninja"" suffers from incoherent storytelling, stock characters and clichd narrative techniques (a secret organization?), the fast-paced movie is not boring with surprisingly decent action stunts including some nice sword fights.

The story is about Casey (Scott Adkins), a westerner adopted in the Kouga ninja clan, trying to protect the ""Yoroi Bitsu,"" a box containing the sacred armor that has been handed down from generation to generation. Adkins shows what he can do in the action sequences (and there are many of them), but watching him kicking ordinary thugs on and on is not very thrilling. The repetitious action choreography needs more creative moves.

Tsuyoshi Ihara plays Masazuka, a disgraced disciple who craves for the clan's heirloom.  Movie fans outside Japan probably remember him as Colonel Takeichi Nishi or ""Baron Nishi"" in Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" Mika Hijii plays the sensei's daughter Namiko. Several scenes of the film indicate both players have enough skills for action stunts, but sadly they are not allowed to show them here.

Like the most low-budget action movies you see on DVD, it is not the silly storyline or cheesy effects that bother us. What is really disappointing about ""Ninja"" is the lack of creative ideas in action choreography, which could have been better considering the martial arts skills of the star.",1328918400,,1551,5.192

4010462,3,B002XTBE60,"It probably would've been less of a headache for everyone if only the sensei had given his unruly pupil another chance. But the sensei didn't, and so Masazuka, expelled from the dojo, went completely over to the dark side, becoming a ruthless ninja assassin. NINJA stars the ridiculously ripped Scott Adkins and tracks his character's attempts in New York City to safeguard the Yorio Bitsu, the legendary weapons of the last Koga Ninja, from the clutches of Masazuka and his waves of thugs. There's also some nefarious secret sect called the Ring throwing in its two cents, not that the script writers fleshed it out that well. Then again, in a martial arts picture, things like script and plot and acting and internal consistency serve a marginal function.

Scott Adkins plays Casey Bowman, an American student of Ninjutsu who as a twelve-year-old orphan was taken in by the martial arts dojo. And as soon as you hear the sensei advise his pupils to ""Listen to Casey,"" you know that the glowering guy over there was steadily getting his hate on. Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is highly offended that the sensei chose to heap praise on the gaijin. And, essentially, that's your conflict right there.

You've seen variations of this same old plot regurgitated before, and you can even throw in that rivalry between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Honestly, in this genre, the story sometimes isn't so important (witness the dumb, go-nowhere sub-plot involving Casey's estranged mother). Sometimes it's enough that the story is there to provide a framing device for what we came for: the bonecrunching martial arts. And in this area, the movie delivers. The fight scenes are dynamically staged. And when it comes to the fight presentation, NINJA improves on NINJA ASSASSIN, it's closest contemporary in terms of release date. NINJA's fight scenes have more clarity, maybe because it doesn't make use of shaky cams or tight close-ups that prevent the viewer from seeing the martial arts moves in great detail. The American martial artist sub-genre has come along since the days of AMERICAN NINJA. Scott Adkins is the real deal and demonstrates more legit martial skills than did good old Michael Dudikoff. Adkins exhibits flair and sleek moves, and I'm pretty sure that's him performing the acrobatic stunts. It's said that Adkins was a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan when he was a kid, and it shows. Check out those impressive helicopter kicks. But try not to wince when Adkins finally puts on that tacky ninja outfit.

I've always wondered why ninjas were so stubborn that they cling solely to the use of traditional weaponry. This flick fixes that concern and demonstrates that at least this ninja can be forward thinking. Masazuka freely employs hi-tech gear to complement the traditional arsenal, and this makes him even more potent. Tsuyoshi Ihara, who with his shades on looks like an evil Asian Jimmy Smits, is really good and menacing as Adkins' foil. The actress who plays the sensei's daughter (and, incidentally, Adkins' love interest) gets to take out a goon or five. In one scene, she even engages in a demo of subway crutch-fu.

NINJA scores high on the violence meter. The ninja assassin's blades cause fountains of blood to jet out of his perforated victims. Body bits get sliced and filleted. There's the occasional beheading or two. Collateral damage is pronounced as tons of innocent bystanders bite a bullet. One particularly awesome kill scene has Adkins hurling a goon out the subway train window only to be pancaked by another oncoming subway train.

But what the hell happened to that police helicopter circling above the climactic fight scene? What, did the cops just give up and leave, after everyone ignored their orders for all parties to drop their weapons? That's not very NYPD.

If they had added comedic scenes, then it might have been salvageable. I'm going to be a little vague only because I don't want to spoil it if you want to watch it anyway.

I don't normally write reviews for movies, but this one was so horrible I felt obligated to warn anyone considering watching this ... or worse, buying it. I kept watching the DVD progress bar to see how much longer I had to watch it (I can't stop in the middle of a movie or a book).

The special effects aren't very realistic. The fighting scenes are mediocre, about the bare minimum you would expect from an action movie. The plot was thin. The main antagonist is after a box of artifacts, acceptance of the sensei, and revenge (?). The artifacts are suppose to have magic capabilities that are never explained - so I think it's really just sentimental, but who knows...

They waste a lot of time on the main character's parents but nothing comes of it. It doesn't really drive him or affect him. It just provides an excuse for why an American is spending his life in Japan. There was absolutely zero character development.

Also at the end, the ""Ring"" Organization wastes a lot of resources trying to kill the main characters. It doesn't really give a reason why a financially motivated organization would try to stop them to such an extent other than as a favor to the main antagonist (however, the ""Ring"" tries to kill him too at the end).

I'm also annoyed that the ninja poison (only ninjas know the poison/antidote combo) was used twice on two other ninjas but no one but the bad guy had the antidote. You would think the sensei/soke would have had one handy.

The cops and the ""Ring"" bad guys were just fodder. The detective just gave them an easy out to push the plot along.

Was pleasantly surprised that the japanese girl actually tried to fight and hold her own, unlike american women in movies who just scream and get in the way of the hero. and she was good so it was cool.

The fighting scenes were few and far between. Lots of blood but not excessive like ninja assassin. I'm really just upset that there were few actual martial arts scenes. It wasn't a bad movie though.

You could literally take this movie back to the 1980s, show it, and not a single person would notice it was from 2009. No one in the movie uses a modern cell phone, laptop computer, PDA, or mp3 player; most of the cars are from the 80s.

4010505,4,B002XTBE60,"There has been a modest revival in Ninja films in the last year, with Ninja Assassin [DVD] [2009] triggering an inevitable wave of DTV low-budget entries into the somewhat anaemic Ninja action movie sub-genre. Ninja follows hot on the heels of the Casper ""I was in Starship Troopers once"" Van Dien vehicle, Mask of the Ninja- a movie that has almost nothing going for it. Mask of the Ninja stumbles and splutters between poorly executed fight scenes, as Van Dien and his co-stars embarrassedly mumble their way through atrocious dialogue; add to the mix awful Seven [DVD] -style editing and poor lighting, and you have a film that isn't worth two hours of your life.

Ninja is a much better film. While not quite harking back to the Ninja genre's giddy, exploitation heights ( for instance Revenge of the Ninja [DVD] [1983]  or American Ninja [DVD] [1985]), the director Isaac Florentine wisely realizes the limitations of his budget, and avoids the temptation of Bourne shaky-cam, while firmly training his camera on star Scott Adkins, who is quite simply phenomenal. Adkins brings a physicality to the role that is reminiscent of Jason Statham in The Transporter/Transporter 2, with the added bonus of being able to do some crazy Tony Jaa-style acrobatics. While the plot, acting, lighting, and score are all barely perfunctory, the fight choreography elevates this movie to low budget, trashy, greatness.",1271376000,11,1407,5.060344827586207

I love deep movies that make you think.  But like any red-blooded man, sometimes I just need an adrenaline-pumping action flick.  That's exactly what Ninja delivers.  You've got great fight sequences, over-the-top acrobatics, and weapons weapons weapons.

This isn't The Notebook or Gone with the Wind.  Don't expect Academy Award performances or a plot that will make you laugh and cry.

I guess they didn't have time or budget to use better filters in post production. Overall, it was like watching a live action 80's cartoon with way over the top stories and villains. I loved those 80's cartoons and the ninja movies of that decade, and this film seemed help me live some of those memories. But overall it was really hurried and poorly done.

Call me old-fashioned, but replacing real-life physicality and athleticism with CGI strikes discord in me. To me, ""Ninja Assassin"" was more of a horror movie with ninjas taking the place of monsters, featuring fight scenes that relied more on post-production editing than the talents of the performers on the set. I liked it even less since it's undoubtedly destined to be the leading lights of a comeback of the original 80s ninja fandom - an honor that couldn't have gone to a worse contestant.  I had more faith Isaac Florentine's low-budget production, since he has proven time over that he has both the skills and appreciation for action movies to be the true architect behind a possible revival. Oh, and his movie starred the current king of kung fu, Scott Adkins. Shouldn't this be great? Well, I certainly hoped so, but I'm sorry to have to admit that ""Ninja"" is no award-winner: while it shows up some of the superficialities of ""Assassin"", it fails to define itself as a worthy alternative by falling short in a number of others.

The story: Casey (Adkins), a western orphan studying the art of ninja in Japan, is asked by his sensei (Togo Igawa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/1404983082/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>) to deliver the prized treasure of their school to America to keep it safe from the hands of a jealous outcast, Masazuka (Tsuyoshi Ihara,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letters-from-Iwo-Jima/dp/B0017XCDN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Letters from Iwo Jima</a>), who has honed his skills and recruited members of an American gang-sect for the sole purpose of getting his hands on the prized heirloom.

Apparently, ""Ninja"" was created back-to-back with another Adkins vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>; knowing this and comparing the production values of the two, it's easy to speculate that ""Ninja"" was lower on Florentine's list of priorities. Don't get me wrong, it's good-looking for a DTV production, but it fails to match the standard set by his other big project. Its superficial sleekness is interrupted by the occasional unnecessary post-production 'enhancement' and the fact that it's not backing up any particularly breathtaking action scenes. Again, what's there is better than any old DTV martial arts flick, but fans of Adkins will note that he's been in more exhilarating brawls than these and delivered much cooler moves. The close-quarters fight in the train is neat, as is the randori in the warehouse, but most of the other fights are either too short or one-sided to stand out. It's all better than quick-cuts and computer effects, in my opinion, but come on - was it really impossible to utilize Adkins as well as he has been in the past?

As a torchbearer of the ninja subgenre, the movie disappoints for choosing to ape the style of ""Ninja Assassin"" rather than classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Ninja/dp/B000092Q4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Ninja</a>. There are some definite clichs and cheesiness to remind us of the good ol' Cannon days, but far from paying homage to the golden era of ninja movies, Florentine indulges in excessive CGI bloodletting and ends up making a minor mockery of the ninja archetype via some clueless character spins and occasionally exaggerating physical abilities to a ridiculous lengths (e.g. the disappearing-in-front-of-your-eyes trick was actually done better in ""Ninja Assassin""). The 'modern ninja' aspect was pretty cool - use of night vision, retractable swords, etc. - but I wish it had been exploited a bit more, especially since the final showdown between Casey and Maz is billed as an all-out old school vs. new grudge match but didn't do much to perpetuate the premise.

Admittedly, maybe I'm being a bit too hard on the movie; I guess I was just hoping for Florentine to pull off another ""Undisputed"" and show up the multimillion-dollar Hollywood studios again. Alas, ""Ninja"" will fool no one about its DTV roots, for it fails to rise above all the stigmas of low-budget moviemaking. As mentioned, comparisons to the other big ninja movie of our time don't fare well for this one: though there's some definite quality here, it fails to shine as brightly as its super-glossy competitor. Florentine fans ought to remain faithful, but if you're looking for the truly defining shadow warrior flick, look to the past - it can't be replicated in modern times, it seems.",1268179200,2,4886,5.818435754189944

Here's the plot in haiku:

Bad jealous ninja
fights American ninja
for number one title.

Despite its simplistic plot (aren't all ninja movies?), low-budget production (which actually didn't look too bad in some parts), a direct-to-video debut, and the fact that it's helmed by Issac Florentine (yes, the same Issac Florentine that directed many a Power Rangers episode), I have to admit this is actually one of the better ninja titles I've seen since the U.S. ninja boom of the '80s. The first American Ninja and any Sh' Kosugi film still hold a nostalgic place in my heart for the cool, campy, yet bloody portrayal that are ninja. And let's face it, when we think of ninja here in the States we usually think of the stealthy, shadow-sneaking, cold-blooded assassin, right? Ninja (this film) does a great job bypassing any real attempt of a story, maybe only believable for a video game or one-shot anime movie, and skips right to the focal point of what makes ninjas so cool -- the style. In addition to the weaponry and costuming, I notice this movie really puts an emphasis on the actual martial arts/hand-to-hand combat aspect. Even with the mediocre visual effects, I think the movie especially excels in the fight choreography department and even has some excellent Snyder-esque cinematography as Mr. Somner mentioned in his editorial review. Scott Adkins looks very fluid and natural with all those spin kicks. And I feel I must make special mention to Tsuyoshi Ihara as the villain. His character's intentions are pretty clear cut, but he really does a great job playing one heck of a rival ninja. Another factor I really enjoy is the fact that they actually divided the script between English and Japanese dialogue to obtain a more realistic atmosphere. On the other end of the spectrum, though, it's still a low-budget B-movie, so if you happen to chuckle or laugh out loud at some of the poor acting and script, it's completely understandable. Invariably, this will probably get a lot of comparisons to the also recent Ninja Assassin. I enjoy both, though I'd have to give Assassin a slight edge for the higher production values and slightly more solid acting/writing (which isn't by much, but there have to be standards at some point, high-budget or not).

Video - 4.5

Brought to you by First Look Studios in 1080p at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39), Ninja presents itself remarkably well for a low-budget B-movie. Detail and skin textures are tight from the very opening of the movie. Colors are well-balanced with no traces of weird tint. Black levels, while excellent, are a little underwhelmed by the contrast during the night/dark scenes. However, I actually found it to be an effect of the lighting used on-stage. Normally darkness results in very grainy shots, but thanks to the artificial lighting, many of those scenes looked much clearer instead. In fact, the transfer is so clean that it really brings out some of the cheapness of the CG. But with that said, my only complaint is with the one scene around the beginning where Sensei is in the darkness of the dojo. It's extremely grainy, but fixes itself in about 3 or 4 seconds. Aside from that, all things considered the film looks near-reference.

Audio - 5.0

Wow, the LFEs are killer. I don't know how such a low-budget film can afford to create such a kick-ass lossless track. Music, gunshots, and dramatic rumbling effects are outstanding on this English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Dialogue doesn't even lose volume amidst all the chaotic fight sequences, and I'm confident to say this is one diamond-in-the-rough of a reference disc. Surrounds offer great separation between flying/crashing objects, sword-slashing, and punches/kicks. One funny thing I find they like to accentuate is the sound of cracking knuckles. For whatever reason, they surely don't look like they're flexing hard enough, but it seems to sound cool anyway. Don't let this film's B-movie status fool you. Regardless of monetary and developmental constraints, this is definitely worth showcasing on your home theaters.

Overall - 4.5

Ninja as a movie completely blew my expectations out of the water. It's cheesy at times, maybe even discombobulating at others, but I find myself oddly enamored by the very nature and presentation of all the ninja elements. With some excellent choreography and cinematography the movie does a very good job killing 87 minutes in style. If you grew up in the '80s watching a good number of those Americanized ninja films, I am willing to bet you'll enjoy this title as well. It's not quite as flashy and stylized as Ninja Assassin, but it's a darn good effort that really outdoes itself with reference audio and near-reference video. Give it a try.",1267747200,5,4766,4.925280199252802
4010517,3,B002XTBE60,"This review will be broken down into two sections: 1) The quality of the movie itself, and 2) The BD Disc quality.

First up, the film itself:

Plot (WARNING, MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!)

The time is present day, and somewhere in a rural region of Japan, a dojo carries on the tradition of the Koga Ninja by training students in the ninja arts. The head of the school, called the Soke, is nearing retirement age and must choose his successor. His top two students are fierce rivals and both are leading candidates to inherit the title of Soke. However, before the Soke can appoint his successor, one of the top two students disgraces himself in a training duel against his rival and is banished from the school.  Predictably, the banished student becomes a freelance assassin, and we see him employ his ninja skills to deadly effect in a very cool assassination sequence.

We soon learn that the Soke is the keeper of some ancient Koga weapons which, legend has it, grants the wielder extraordinary abilities. The banished ninja comes calling to claim the weapons, but only after they've been shipped elsewhere for safekeeping. A vicious battle ensues between the bansihed ninja and the Soke, and at the conclusion of this battle, the chase is on for the Koga weapons, with the film culminating in a showdown between, you guessed it, the two rival ninja students. In this climactic battle, only one survives.

As an added bonus, the beautiful daughter of the Soke is thrown into the mix, but sadly, she serves as little more than window dressing. While she demonstrates some ninja skills, she is mostly helpless in a fight and is relegated to the role of damsel in distress more often than not, despite having trained all her life in the ninja arts. Though in her defense, she's fairly useful with a bow and arrow, and she's nice to look at.

The plot is better than most straight to video flicks, and in this case, serves as the thin thread tying the action scenes together, which are themselves well choreographed and well filmed.

The Action:

The action scenes feature the generous use of ninja weapons, including some impressive sword battles, as well as some decent hand to hand fight scenes.  Aside from three fairly intense one-on-one fight scenes (all featuring liberal use of the katana), most of the battles feature one of the top ninjas in the film dispatching a multitude of lesser skilled opponents.  The star of the film, Scott Adkins (caucasian actor and good guy ninja), demonstrates impressive martial arts and acrobatic ability, and it appears that he performed most of his own stunts. Keep your eyes open for a scene where he uses his acrobatic ability to evade an oncoming car. The ninja villain (asian actor and bad guy ninja, read into that what you will) also seemed to be well versed in martial arts and the use of ninja weapons, and I dare say that the fight scenes in this movie were more impressive than those in ""Ninja Assassin"" due in equal part to good choreography (far better than a Van Damme or Seagal flick, though don't expect anything as energetic or creative as what you'd see from Hong Kong legends like Yuen Woo Ping, Corey Yuen, Jet Li or Jackie Chan), the actors in this film being experienced martial artists, and an editing style that lingers just long enough on the action (as opposed to the hyper-quick cut aways used in Ninja Assassins, which is the norm for a film featuring actors who aren't very adept at performing the action featured in the film) so you can appreciate the skill of the actors pulling off the moves.

The Acting:

Nothing to write home about. The actors look and play their parts well enough as far as action films like this go, but none of them deliver performances that will leave a long lasting impression on you.  That's a good thing though, because the acting isn't horrible either. It's just good enough to move the story along, as threadbare and full of plotholes as it is.

The special effects:

There is liberal use of blood splattering, sometimes into the camera, when a katana is used to lethal effect. The blood didn't look overly cartoony to me, but your tolerance/appreciation of these effects will vary depending on how much of a gorehound you are.

The pyrotechnics are good.  Swords clashing generate sparks at the appropriate times, and I recall two separate vehicle explosions also being impressively done.

As for the BLU-RAY itself:

Picture quality on my 1080P Phillips is excellent, though not quite reference material. The image is generally sharp, colors are well delineated with little crush evident in day or night scenes, and there is very little to no film grain, leading me to believe the film was shot digitally, with some grain retained for a film-like appearance.

I can't provide a detailed review of the audio, as I utilize only the speakers on my tv itself, but from what I heard, I can say the audio came across clearly, with dialogue being easy to pick up and louder foley effects, such as swords clashing, gun fire, and explosions, coming in crisply as well.

There is nothing in the way of special features, unless you count previews of other movies.

All in all, if you're not too critical when it comes to martial arts themed movies, and you have an interest in seeing ninjas fighting ninjas and killing people in bloody fashion without an overuse of rapid cut editing, you may be pleasantly surprised.  I recommend ""Ninja"" to viewers who are nostalgic for films like American Ninja (the first and best of the series) and Sho Kosugi films like Revenge of the Ninja.

Is Ninja worth a blind buy though? I'd say for the $15 price tag, it is if you're a fan of violent and bloody ninja films. If you're just a casual fan, a rental is the safest bet.
