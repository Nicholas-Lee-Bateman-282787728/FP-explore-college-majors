914912,5,6304544081,This video will make you a bigfoot believer. They do exist in the Pacific North West. They are like needles in a haystack except these needles keep moving and moving!,942796800,2,166,4.566666666666666
914913,3,6304544081,"This video includes the famous '67 Patterson/Gimlin film; that's one good thing about it. But it also includes (Big)footage of something you can't make out what is. It's filmed through trees and bushes, and it really could  be just about anything. The two guys who apparently lensed it are  interviewed, and they come across as being very used to the situation of  being on camera. Their piece of film shows, and proves nothing. A staged  field-search with Sasquatch investigator Peter Byrne is also shown. My  comments make me sound like a disbeliever, I know, but in reality I firmly  believe these creatures are real... I'm talking about Bigfoot now,  ofcourse. The many sightings can't be lies, bears, or men in (black) suits  all of them !. And then there's the featured Patterson/Gimlin film. -If  it's a hoax, why hasn't Gimlin had enough fun, and said so yet ?. (As far  as I know, he's not making any money on the film.) -Gimlin and his friend  were just two very lucky men, that glorious day back in '67. The scientists  who dismiss the film as a prank, will have to eat their unscientific words  one fine day. -And I can't wait!. If it's such a clever hoax, surely there  would have been dozens of (better) faked, and filmed ""high tech""  Bigfoots by now, don't you think ?. -And just why have we not seen that ?.  -Naturally because no one could, and this object is authentic. Conclusion:  Bigfoot is alive and well, walking this way, and living in your own  backyard. Still, ""serious science"" doesn't seem to care. Go  figure.",934934400,33,1538,4.650557620817844

915015,4,6304544081,"I really enjoyed this program when it was aired on A&E many years ago; Leonard Nimoy's narrative adds a distinct quality to it. I would love to see an updated version of it, maybe with new evidence or more interviews, but still a fantastic look into the subject of Sasquatch/ Bigfoot, and I think it's a must have for any fan of the mysterious creature. Grover Krantz offers some unique insights ,and his book "" Bigfoot Prints"" makes a good companion to the video for the serious enthusiast. All in all, a great DVD",1357430400,,515,4.48936170212766

915017,4,6304544081,"""Ancient Mysteries: Bigfoot"" is a surprisingly sober look at the Bigfoot mystery, from the angle of the believers. It's narrated by Leonard Nimoy (Spock in Star Trek).

According to another reviewer, this is actually an old show from the 1990's, which may explain why it doesn't mention the more recent hoax allegations against the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. ""Ancient Mysteries"" treats the film as crucial evidence for the existence of Bigfoot, arguing that the creature walks and moves in a manner inconsistent with a human (read: a man in an ape costume). They also believe that Hollywood wasn't sophisticated enough in 1967 to even make costumes as realistic as the one seen in the film.

Apart from one ""token sceptic"", almost everyone else interviewed in ""Ancient Mysteries: Bigfoot"" believes that Bigfoot is a real, flesh-and-blood creature. One anthropologist speculates that the Bigfoots live in small groups of about five individuals, eat salmon and have an uncanny ability to stay clear of humans. They are said to be descendants of Gigantopithecus, the largest fossil ape known to science. Other evidence (real or perceived) presented includes a spooky sound recording, footprints and additional footage (I admit I couldn't make out anything on the Herriett/Owen video either).

A more humorous sequence shows a Bigfoot festival in Willow Creek, in which two residents claim that Bigfoot is just Elvis in a monkey suite. There's also a shot showing a sensational tabloid article about a man shooting a Bigfoot only to take the carcass home and eat it! First, it'll kill'ya, then it'll eat'ya?

I admit that the physical evidence is intriguing, but there are also obvious problems with the flesh-and-blood theory. Is it *really* possible for a large creature to survive in the Pacific Northwest undetected for centuries? What about the Bigfoot sightings in flatland prairie states? It seems the elusive creature has been sighted in all 50 states of the union...and in the rest of the world, as well. Somehow, this doesn't add up. One man in the program, a Native elder, suggests that Bigfoot is a spirit that can materialize or dematerialize at will, citing reports about Bigfoots being shot only to vanish, or about tracks that disappear right in the middle of nowhere...

If actual, physical creatures of the primate lineage have managed to survive undetected all around the world, including Upstate New York, something is very wrong about our basic ideas concerning biology and, arguably, animal tracking. If Bigfoot is an interdimensional creature, something is very wrong about our basic ideas concerning everything else, too...

Do we really want to know the solution to this one? ;-)

Be that as it may, I nevertheless recommend ""Ancient Mysteries: Bigfoot"" as a good introduction to the subject.",1351209600,3,2816,5.18942731277533
915018,5,6304544081,"I've always liked Ancient Mysteries series back in the 80's
so I had to get this subject about Bigfoot!

915019,4,6304544081,"I bought this Documentary 4 years ago ( for 30$ ) and I still believe that this is one of the best documentary about Bigfoot. The first two chapters are by far the best chapters, I still watch them very often. The other chapters are ok, but nothing extraordinary.

If you are a real fan of The Bigfoot phenomenon then go ahead, buy this DVD. For less than 10$ it's a very, very good buy. The documentary is a little short ( less than 50 minutes ) but for less than 10$ you can't go wrong. :)",1308441600,,491,4.061855670103093
915020,5,6304544081,"This DVD is worth watching. Approximately fifty minutes long, but sticks to the bigfoot story(s). For those who have not encountered the creature and need more information about the creature, this DVD will do it. I enjoyed it watching it. If you feel you should watch it, don't hesitate. Worth buying the DVD.",1298851200,,309,4.849056603773585
915021,4,6304544081,"From the A&E Ancient Mysteries Series comes this little gem of ""Bigfoot."" The narration is what sold me. Leonard Nimoy is the best, in my opinion, at this sort of story telling.
Whether you agree with the facts or just enjoy a good mystery , this DVD delivers, albeit, for only 50 minutes, and there are no extras. So, find it at the lowest price possible, and enjoy.
Now if they would only release the ""In Search Of"" series, that would be something. A terrific series about the Unexplained, Unknown, and Mysterious. Worth your time if you like stories with incomplete facts and/or endings. Also narrated by Leonard Nimoy.",1280620800,3,622,4.715596330275229
915075,5,6304544081,This is one of the best Dvd documentarys of Bigfoot out their.

915077,5,6304544081,This is a good documentary.  Only drawback was that its too short.  It contained no special features whatsoever.  Grover Krantz & Peter Byrne were great as always.  Wish this had been a longer documentary.,1245715200,2,205,4.9411764705882355
915078,4,6304544081,"Basic information on the subject of bigfoot, points of view, great graphics and actual locations in many of the scenes.

915079,4,6304544081,"When I give a rating of four stars, it means there is very little room for much better or improvement. (5 stars IMB is reserved for the very rare, best of the best). Don't let the price of this DVD for 50 minutes of Bigfoot stop you in this case. I love the narration with Leonard Nimoy in this version. The narration is the same word for word as the original TV released version. Only better IMO with LN's voice. You get top notch stories, history and examination of bigfoot extending over 125 years. This is a high quality production with great re-watchability. Feels like more than 50 minutes as you view this too. Just wish it would never end. Highly Recommended.",1217289600,,667,4.475409836065574
915080,4,6304544081,"This DVD traces the beginning of Bigfoot in the late 1950's till the mid 1990's (but does not include the Freeman footage).  I have to admit, it will make you think about what might be out there.  I have had a hard time accepting this entire legend, but this DVD presents it in the best possible way.  BOTH sides are looked at - why some think it's a real thing, and others that thinks it's a comical hoax.  It does analyze the famous 1967 Patterson/Gimlin film of the ""female"" Bigfoot in northern CA, and does point out things I never noticed in it - making it seem real.  It does show the Scott Herriott/Daryl Owen film of the Bigfoot looking them down at a mere 35 feet away, although it's thru thick bushes (and almost spooky).

If you do or do not believe in this, it is worth a look.  My personal belief is about 50/50 - how can almost 2000 of these things (according to the DVD) be alive and we only have a few shaky. blurry, far away videos and footprints of it - nothing more?  You be the judge.",1203465600,2,1004,4.192708333333333
915081,4,6304544081,"This documentary, originally aired in 1994 on A&E, was very well-done and was very fair as to its assessments of the Bigfoot Mystery. Luminaries in the Bigfoot field such as the late Dr. Grover Krantz, Peter Byrne, Scott Herriott, Al Hodgson and Roderick Sprague are interviewed about their research and their opinions on the hunt for these elusive creatures. Byrne was running the Bigfoot Research Project at that time out of Parkdale, Oregon, and is shown in the field investigating a sighting. Dr. Krantz is shown in his lab at Washington State University with his footprint casts and his Gigantopithecus model based on the jawbone of the mystery primate. Herriott's video (along with Darryl Owen's) are both shown, as is the Patterson/Gimlin Movie, with narration from Gimlin. Skeptical scientist John Crane is also interviewed about his opinions on the subject. This version is slightly different from the original, with Leonard Nimoy (In Search Of...) as the narrator, and some clips are edited a little differently, but overall it is the same one seen in 1994. It ends in Willow Creek, California during the Bigfoot Daze celebration with different townspeople giving their assessments of the reality of the creature, as well as the cultural influences Bigfoot has had through the years. I do recommend this documentary for anyone's Cryptozoology collection.",1198540800,,1364,5.232876712328767
915082,4,6304544081,"This is a fun DVD to watch. There isn't a lot of new information in the piece, but the fundamentals of this mystery/legend are well represented. Decades after it was shot, I am still floored by the Patterson/Gimlin footage.",1188864000,2,223,4.743589743589744
915083,5,6304544081,"I bought this dvd because I wanted  to start  exploring the possibility of hidden creatures. BOY,was I surprised to view this documentary! Both views were presented,the believer and sceptics. It is wonderfully done with respect to both sides of the subject at hand. While the visual sightings of bigfoot were somewhat questionable,they did present a plausible explanation to them and what the eyewitnesses saw. Everything is covered,from the first sightings of the creature in the eighteen hundreds to the most current ones.the films of sasquatch are examined quite well and modern technology is used to give the footage  depth and credibility. I am just beginning my research for all things un-explained,and the possibility of life from outer space. If there was one down side to this dvd,it would have to be that it was too short,but that is it! I feel like fox mulder....I want to believe. After viewing this dvd,I would have to say that I hold out hope that we will find that tall,hairy beast that has captured our imagination for so long. One thing is certain,all these sightings point to the fact that while no one has captured bigfoot,something is out there. Even if some or if not most of the general population  does not understand it yet,much less believe in it,something is out there that reigns over the Pacific Northwest. As for me all I can say is....I want to believe.",1186531200,10,1383,4.872340425531915

915139,5,6304544081,I love this DVD. This is the best dvd out there on Bigfoot. Watching it makes me want to know more.

915141,4,6304544081,"This is the Bigfoot episode of A&E's Ancient Mysteries series. I have this recorded on VHS and will end up comparing content between the vhs and the dvd in the future. None-the-less, this Leonard Nimoy narrated episode is done quite well if not brief. It's less than 50 minutes long and there are no extras. The show itself is one of the better ones on the subject matter of bigfoot. Main sources for this documentary are from the late Grover Krantz and Peter Byrne with his former Bigfoot Research Project out of Mt Hood, OR. It includes the Scott Herriett/Daryl Owen video footage of a purported bigfoot in the bushes; I however have never ""seen"" what the hell it is they say is a bigfoot in their video (even with the computer enhancement version, I just don't see it) and I've never seen much further coverage of it anywhere but this show. This episode originally aired in 1994 and lightly revamped in 1997, I recommend this for your bigfoot collection.",1154044800,21,957,4.635294117647059
915142,4,6304544081,"I had the vhs version of this documentary several years ago, and when I saw it was coming out on DVD I hoped it was the same one.

It was, and yet it wasn't. The one I had did not have Leonard Nimoy as the narrator. I forget who he was, but his voice was more suited to the material than Nimoy's. I also noticed that some material has been added, as well as cut from the original.

It may well be that the vhs version was the revised one, and that the one with Leonard Nimoy was the original, I don't know.

But anyway, this is a very good Bigfoot film and well worth your time and money. If you get hold of the vhs version, you'll see what I mean about the differences.",1114992000,37,670,3.948148148148148
915143,4,6304544081,"This is one of the first Sasquatch videos I had ever seen. It presents the material beautifully if a little dated. I had to get it for the collection. THis had lots of data, and was narrated well by Leonard Nimoy [ another bonus!!]

915144,4,6304544081,"A very good documentary for enthusiasts in the field of cryptozoology.  The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is the problems I have with all television documentaries on these subjects, and that is, the film makers simply aren't given enough time to put forth all the information and evidence that is needed to fully complete their argument.  One hour minus commercial time is simply not long enough.  But make no mistake, this documentary has everything needed to start that argument including a detailed discussion of the legendary Patterson film, analysis of distinct and unique footprints with Peter Byrne and the late Dr. Grover Krantz(both integral to the subject of Sasquatch), as well as historical and a few eye witness accounts.  Production values are high as usual with A&E but with an extra hour to present more evidence and accounts, the argument for the existence would have been made much more thoroughly to no fault of the film makers or contributers.  I'm sure their hands were tied.  Anyone interested may want to try and find a copy of Peter Byrne's book, 'Bigfoot: Monster, Man, or Myth'.  It is as good and thorough a book as you will ever read on the subject.",1037404800,,1187,4.760975609756097

This is the first video I've purchased on the subject and enjoyed it thoroughly (that Patterson video footage is creepy...)! The eccentric Peter Byrne (a former big-game hunter who headed up an expedition called ""The Bigfoot Research Project"" from 1993-97) offers some interesting views on the Sasquatch subject. Narrator Leonard Nimoy also engrosses you into the subject matter. I most enjoyed Dr. Grover Krantz's (a university professor) theories and views on the Patterson film. There was some footage included from a 1992 sighting which I have some reservations about (two yahoos see a pair of Sasquatch eyeballs peering at them through the foliage). But, overall, a VERY enjoyable 50 minutes and it definitely leaves you hungry for more.",995846400,9,866,5.148936170212766

Some interesting facts were that some bigfoot print casts display dermal ridges, same as fingerprints, what hoaxer would take the time to do this?  How can something as big as Bigfoot exist in todays world and not be seen?  Since World War II there has been 73 aircraft lost in the forests of the Pacific Northwest,and they haven't been found either.  Why haven't we found remains of a Bigfoot?  According to Peter Byrnes, in over 20 years of asking he has yet to talk to anyone that has found the remains of bears that have died naturally in the forest, and we know bears exist.

Leonard Nimoy provides an excellent narrative that flows along well with the five parts in the documentary. There have been too many sightings all over the country for this to be a hoax. It is a primitive form of primate that has yet to be documented. New species are being discovered on a daily basis, even as crowded as our planet is becoming with human population. There is a lot of territory in the Pacific Northwest that man has never set foot on, and still plenty of room for a few thousand of these creatures to roam virtually undetected until one or more of them stumbles upon a camper, hiker or a hunter. This is probably the best documentary I have seen on the subject, covering the Indian lore of Bigfoot, looking at it from a scientific approach through Grover Krantz's analysis, seeing the Patterson-Gimlin film, and even the commercial aspects of Bigfoot in Willow Creek, California.
