4343365,5,B004EPZ06Q,"""The Hangover Part II"" is great! This is how the story goes: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to exotic Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the unforgettable bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu is taking no chances and has opted for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. However, things don't always go as planned. What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas, but what happens in Bangkok can't even be imagined.

The cast led by Bradley Cooper (as Phil), Ed Helms (as Stu), Zach Galifianakis (as Alan), Ken Jeong (as Mr. Chow) & Justin Bartha (as Doug) is great. The directing by Todd Phillips (who also produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Phillips, Craig Mazin & Scot Armstrong is great.

The music by Christophe Beck is great. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher is great. The film editing by Debra Neil-Fisher & Michael L. Sale is great. The casting by Justine Baddeley & Kim Davis-Wagner is great. The production design by Bill Brzeski is great. The art direction by Desma Murphy & Philip Toolin is great. The set decoration by Danielle Berman is great. The costume design by Louise Mingenbach is great.

This is a great sequel that is funny and entertaining, just as its original was. This is just as great as its original, as well. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, so far, by far.",1306540800,2,1304,4.612068965517241
4343366,2,B004EPZ06Q,"On the commentary track for David Gordon Green's ""PINEAPPLE EXPRESS"", Seth Rogen compares the audience of that film, watching him put his blown off ear back together, with the audience that can watch ""HOSTEL"" and ""SAW"" unflinchingly, then decides that they both might be the same audience. There was an eruption of laughter in my theater during the original ""HOSTEL"" film, when Jay Hernandez's torturer slipped on two severed fingers, accidentally driving a chain saw through his midsection. I heard similar outbursts during a fantasy sequence in ""SUPERBAD"" when a security guard brutally slashes Jonah Hill's throat with a bottle. There is a line that's no longer fine when dividing horror realism with comedy or vice versa, and Todd Phillips' ""THE HANGOVER PART 2"", has no idea which side of the road it's on.

The picture opens with a small gathering of laborers putting seats together by an alter for a wedding. An impatient bride receives a phone call from Bradley Cooper, who is not her groom to be. His side profile shot leaves just enough room in frame to show Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, staring at the ground in defeat. ""That's not going to happen"", Cooper responds to the question of a yay or nay wedding. Cut to rolling camera overheads of empty landscapes featuring the sounds of Danzig. Sound familiar? If you've seen the original, you've basically seen the new one-but instead of Las Vegas, they're in Bangkok.

I find it unnecessary to explain any of the plot, seeing how the original has generated almost half of a billion dollars and is considered the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time. I doubt there's few who have any interest in this picture at all that don't know what the scenario is. What the original lacked, this one tried to make up for, and unfortunately failed in the process. Like a ""SCREAM"" movie, these characters aren't stupid and are very aware of what they did in the movies before, which weeds out a lot of guess work, but makes it hard for the formula to be executed as well as the original.

Todd Phillips is a constantly maturing filmmaker, and I believe the original ""HANGOVER"" will remain his most gifted work (it even brought him a Best Film in Comedy or Musical category at The Golden Globes). He became noticed with the forgettable yet disturbing documentary, ""FRAT HOUSE"" followed by the equally forgettable ""BITTERSWEET MOTEL"" where he followed the band Phish, for reasons I still don't quite understand. ""ROAD TRIP"" was a success but didn't have the comic fortune that his ""OLD SCHOOL"" did. There should be no question that Frat Boy humor is what his pictures bleed from the frames, and probably always will. So setting his first sequel in Thailand, I anxiously awaited the plethora of ""Bangkok jokes"" that would fall flat, only to discover there would be just one...and anything but flat.

There was a dark ferocity in part one that didn't go too far over the limit. There were times I thought the missing Doug might be dead, and the film was structured to such a confident degree that it would have maybe even worked better if he was. They played with jokes about the date rape drug, and I was somewhat disappointed that none of them were. For the most part, he makes up for what I was hoping would happen to the characters, with ""HANGOVER PART 2"" and goes to the darkest territories he's yet to uncover in a picture. But again, I was disappointed that he didn't see them all the way through, (one including a potential death that would have honored the ever present dread element).

The biggest uproars in the theater were not laughs, but gasps. Sure to be the most talked about involves Ed Helms' character, Stu, with something that had people rolling in the aisles in ""NAKED GUN 33 1/3"" and had mouths drop to the floor in disbelief with the clever twist in Neil Jordan's ""THE CRYING GAME"". This is neither, because it is pure shock value, and this is where the two genres of Comedy and Horror share a dysfunctional marriage. ""THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY"" was an enormous success, because in between the I-can't-believe-it's, was a clever Rom-Com with a superior script. Movies like the ""AMERICAN PIE"" series and virtually every Ashton Kutcher flop, had no talent executives see two scenes and think ""we got to up the ante"". The ante became nothing short of trash and not even blanketed with a clever script around it. Hard to believe now, because of films like ""THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE"" and ""TEETH"", but less than a decade ago, people flocked to the theater to see the original ""SAW"" because they thought, ""is he really going to cut his foot off?"" That one foot spawned hundreds of severed feet, where a whole generation of moviegoers now yawn at detachable body parts. Just because it's bloodier or grosser does not make it scarier or funnier.

There is a new breed of comedy that's been creeping up through the cracks, that's darker, meaner and fiercer. Filmmakers like Jody Hill who gave us ""OBSERVE AND REPORT"" and HBO's ""EASTBOUND AND DOWN"" are scoring big with audiences. Anything goes for a laugh nowadays, be it violence, rape or heavy drug use. There used to be a time when marijuana was the only drug you could make jokes about, now we're asked to laugh at heroine use and roofies (with a little cocaine on the side). Phillips seems so desperate to play with these ideas, that the context they're being used in is inappropriate for the movie that we're watching. That's not to say the ""mean bone"" the comedy skeleton has been adapting by way of Comedic Darwinism is a failure-I think Danny McBride, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are all greatly onto something, but when you're funniest character (and most lovable if you could say that) is still the naturally born clueless dim-wit who cries for friendship, you need to keep that bone out of your skeletal structure. Phillips was so desperate to get blood on the side of the characters' car, they pointlessly drive through a dead pig. Not to sound like a psychopath, but if you're going for that effect, why not hit a character?

There is, however, no argument that it was fun to see this group again on the screen. Every actor is as gifted comedically as they are dramatically and as usual, Galifianakis is the show stealer. I laughed quite a bit, but not as hard as I wanted to...I mostly closed my eyes. There is a look to this movie that I can only compare to Eli Roth's ""HOSTEL"" films. The grit, the uncertainty and the nastily rusted hole in the wall rooms that look like torture chambers, sort of worked perfectly with this picture. In the marketing for both ""HOSTEL PART 2"" and ""THE HANGOVER PART 2"", we see empty rooms with spinning fans and leaky pipes that are so dirty you wouldn't want to put your worst enemy in them. Without any major props, blood on the walls or talent, your mind races by just seeing these empty rooms thinking ""how did they get there?"" and ""what could have possibly happened?"". ""HANGOVER 2"" also beautifully plays with the horrors of not knowing where you are overseas, that ""HOSTEL"" and John Landis' ""AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON"" earned 80% of their atmos-fear from. I don't think it's a coincidence that all three filmmakers (Phillips, Roth and Landis) have intertwined violence with frat boys, going back to the original with Landis' ""ANIMAL HOUSE"", which is the reason we even have a ""HANGOVER"" in the first place. They're all extremely gifted filmmakers, who all show similarities in style. I eagerly await Todd Phillips' horror film, if it ever finds its way down his career path.

""THE HANGOVER"" worked itself to such a clever limit, where every obstacle was a discovery and within each discovery were more hilarious details and anecdotes, whether believable or not, they complimented the talent and the story. A high speed drive in a beaten down Mercedes, where a van pulls alongside of them, tossing out their wedding tuxedos, followed by a complimentary close of one character's misfortune turned to discovering $80,000 worth of Bellagio hotel chips, works so much better than just a straight boat ride home with no catharsis. Take a tattoo, shaved head, nasty hotel room and a monkey. Does that even come close to the efforts of a smoking chair, Crystal champaign bottles set like bowling pins, missing tooth, Tiger in the bathroom, baby in the closet, valet attendant returning them a police car and an unexplained chicken? No. You give more, you can work with more. ""HANGOVER 2"" resides on old elements that aren't half as clever as the first.",1306540800,2,8528,4.74966261808367
4343367,3,B004EPZ06Q,"The Hangover 2 is almost an exact copy of the first film, with a new location and a slightly higher shock value of course. The boys are headed to Stu's wedding in Bangkok, but of course they get drugged again, wake up with all sorts of problems, and have to solve the puzzle of what happened.

There is nothing really wrong with this movie other than the fact that we've see it before. You can tell they went with the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach. The main difference I noticed was the much darker vibe and it's less fun because of it.

Still, the cast is good all around, with Zach Galifianakis still providing most of the laughs with his weird humor, and there are more than a few moments that had my whole theater cracking up really loud. I know it's going to make a ton of money (I just saw it has already made over $60 million in two days) and I do recommend it if you liked the original, but I don't think we need a third Hangover.",1306540800,3,951,4.163043478260869
4343368,4,B004EPZ06Q,"When The Hangover was released in 2009 and became a box-office sensation and a cultural phenomenon, it also made a sequel an inevitability. When official word came that one had been greenlit, I, like many others, wondered how it could be made without repeating the same formula. Without that formula, it's not really a sequel so much as a new film with the same characters. Apparently, director Todd Phillips had the same thought and returns with what, at face value, looks like the laziest sequel in years. Following the exact same template as the first, The Hangover Part II is less of a sequel and more of a remake. Change the location from Vegas to Thailand, switch Doug out for Stu's brother-in-law, change the jokes, and you're left with a sequel that essentially follows it's predecessor note-for-note. After all, Hollywood is notorious for putting no effort into a sequel when it has a built-in audience and is a sure-fire hit. I admit that I had reservations going in, but as I settled in to watch the film I found that what I mistook for laziness was actually logic; ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Whether you find this logical or not, this was Todd Phillips' logic while making this film and, defying all logic, it actually works.

The film reunites Doug (Justin Bartha), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms) as they prepare to travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding to fiancee Lauren (Jamie Chung). Due to what happened in Vegas, they all agree to not invite Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and only change their minds out of guilt when he discovers their plan. Once in Thailand, the four decide to have a small bonfire by the beach along with Lauren's 16-year-old brother Teddy (Mason Lee). Phil, Stu, and Alan awake the next morning in a Bangkok hotel room and find themselves in a remarkably familiar situation. This time, however, Doug is safe (having left the bonfire early) and it is Teddy who is missing.

If you've seen the first film, you can fill in the rest from here. Every plot point is basically the same, just tweaked ever-so-slightly. Remember baby Carlos and the tiger from the first film? Well now there's a monkey and a Buddhist monk. The main cast is all here, but there's plenty of familiar faces too, with Ken Jeong and Jeffrey Tambor reprising their roles as Mr. Chow and Sid Garner, respectively. Even Bryan Callen who played Eddie (the owner of the wedding chapel) appears, albeit in a different role. New faces include Paul Giamatti and Nick Cassavetes (who replaced Liam Neeson, after the actor was unable to re-shoot his cameo).

Making a sequel to The Hangover could not have been an easy task. Not only was it a box office hit, but many of the film's jokes and bits of dialogue have become a part of the cultural vernacular. With a movie that has become so ingrained into moviegoer's collective consciousness, how can a sequel expect to achieve the same effect? Rather than trying to force this sequel into the same realm, Phillips and his cast rely on one of the most important factors of the original's success: the chemistry between the three principal actors. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis slip back into their roles effortlessly and manage to capture the magic that made the last film such a joy to watch. Although the three have vastly different comedic styles, they somehow blend together and bounce off of each other perfectly. Sure the element of surprise is missing and the sequel is a little darker in tone, but all the essential ingredients are here, along with the added bonus of the beautiful scenery of Thailand (admittedly juxtaposed with some of the grittier areas of Bangkok).

The humor of both films is raunchy and irreverent, built on stupid rather than sophisticated humor. Even so, there is intelligence behind the irreverence which makes these films appeal to such a wide audience. However, Part II does seem more crude and much raunchier than it's predecessor with many jokes and shots pertaining to male anatomy. There is nothing here that is likely to offend fans of the original, although Phillips seems to be testing the limits of the MPAA's 'R' rating. The bottom-line is that the main cast retains their chemistry together and the new players, particularly Giamatti, are funny enough to keep the film from being bogged down and becoming a pointless retread of earlier material. The film does take some cheap jabs at Asian stereotypes, but this is unlikely to offend the intended audience as Asian stereotypes are hardly a new thing for this series (Mr. Chow was, after all, in the first film).

Critics have come down hard on the film, but, as of this writing, audiences seem satisfied (the film currently holds a 7.2 on IMDB). It's easy to see why critics have shown dismay for it, but none of them seem convinced that it's a bad film, simply one they were already subjected to a couple years ago. This movie is critic-proof; it's not for film critics and film scholars, but for people who enjoyed the first movie. Is The Hangover Part II better than it's predecessor? Probably not, as this one lacks the fresh, new, and surprising quality of the first. There was a certain spark that the filmmakers could not hope to replicate due to the familiarity of the first movie. With that in mind, I can't imagine you not liking this film if you enjoyed the original, as they are two parts of the same entity; the jokes are different, but everything else is the same. I saw the film in a theatre with roughly 30 people who reacted with the same riotous laughter that I heard people react to the first film with. I don't know how Todd Phillips successfully made an effective, funny movie by remaking his own work...But he did. While it's unlikely to achieve the iconic status of it's predecessor, The Hangover Part II is a worthy companion piece to a comedy that many people already consider a classic.

GRADE: B",1306540800,2,5879,4.736328125
4343369,5,B004EPZ06Q,"Let's get the meat of the review out of the way right away: if you enjoyed the first movie, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the second.

Yes, perhaps it is the same basic plot-line, but that's part of what makes the movie so funny. ""It happened again"" Phil says. ""Seriously, what is wrong with the three of you?"" Tracy replies.  Somehow, these three can't keep out of trouble.

But perhaps this time is even a bit more insane. Because this time they're lost in Thailand and have lost Stu's 16-year old brother-in-law.  Only this time, not only do they have no idea what happened, they have no idea how they became so inebriated that it could happen in the first place.  They only intended to have one beer...and of course, just like the first movie, we don't see the events occur. We learn about them as they flush out what happened.

If you're easily offended, this movie isn't for you.  If you didn't enjoy the first one, there's nothing about the second one that changes enough to make you like this one any more.

But if you want to bust a gut laughing, go see The Hangover Part II.",1306454400,12,1092,4.425
4343370,5,B004EPZ06Q,"This movie was wonderful! it took a mixed version of the plot from the first one and set it in an even scarier place, bangkok. It was really graphic and i honestly was happy that the director wasn't afraid to try new and extremely graphic stuff! Ed, Zach, and Bradley return as the funniest trio i have ever seen and i hope to see them again! This is a Must-See!!!!!",1306368000,4,366,4.242857142857143
4343371,2,B004EPZ06Q,"Most people seem to really enjoy The Hangover. It wouldn't be the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time if they didn't, right? The movie also has a fairly solid reputation, as well; certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes along with above average scores just about everywhere else you look. With that said, it's better as a standalone film. Pushing another Hangover film onto the masses would water down and lessen the impact of what made the first film entertaining. The Hangover Part II proves just that and illustrates what a film made solely for money and nothing more really is.

I felt like I missed out for not seeing the original film in theaters. Due to how often I laughed out loud during its duration, it certainly seemed to warrant a theatrical viewing. With the sequel's release upon us, it seemed like an easy solution. But promotion for the sequel made me feel weary. Trailers pretty much let everybody know that audiences would be sitting through the exact same film again. As it turns out, it is. The Hangover Part II is probably about 90% the same film as The Hangover.

A few things are changed in comparison to the first film: there's a drug dealing monkey instead of a tiger, Stu gets a tattoo instead of losing a tooth, Alan loses his hair instead of his pants, they're in Thailand instead of Vegas, Jamie Chung replaces Heather Graham (different characters, but still), and a new character is missing instead of one of ""The Wolfpack."" Everything else plays out nearly identically to the first film other than them checking the roof first; searching all over the city, outrageous antics, Stu's realization that the person they were looking for was right under their nose the entire time, Mike Tyson having a small cameo, right down to the ending leading to pictures in the credits. It's difficult to consider these spoilers when this is technically a film you've already seen. There are a few surprises in there, but not enough to make this sequel feel worthwhile.

Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow gets a bigger role this time around and he's just as much a blessing as he is poison to the sequel. He has a few pretty classic one-liners, but is really annoying overall. So right after he mutters something amusing, he usually ruins it immediately afterward by either taking the joke too far or just saying something lame. He's a perfect example of too much of a good thing.

Part of me wishes that The Hangover Part II would've combined The Human Centipede just to see something different. Phil, Alan, and Stu waking up as part of The Human Centipede without any recollection of how they got there sounds way more interesting than what we received. At least it'd be something different and not a complete rehash.

The Hangover Part II does offer a handful of laughs, but suffers because it's the illegitimate twin brother of the original film. Its redundancy renders it an unnecessary experience even for the most die-hard Hangover fan. You'd probably be better off just watching the first one at home again and saving yourself $10. Part II may also set the record for most male genitalia shown in a wide released R-rated film or at least gives the record a run for its money. Men's junk and its overuse was all that was being discussed as people exited the theater.

At the end of the day, The Hangover Part II is a mostly pointless sequel that's excessive, repetitive, and manages to tarnish what good it had going for it the first time around. If the small references to the first film weren't in there, it could probably pass as a remake. While it does offer some laughs and is bound to kill at the box office, it doesn't seem worth the trouble since it's basically the same journey with the addition of a bucket load of shafts and testicles and a cigarette smoking monkey.",1306368000,6,3789,4.673163418290854
4343372,4,B004EPZ06Q,"The Wolfpack is back with a vengeance! The Hangover 2 may be better than the original. It has more action, more Chow, and more hilarious Alan moments.

4344865,5,B004EPZ06Q,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning.

The Hangover Part II is a lighthearted, sarcastic film about a group of guys partying it up before one of their weddings. This is the second in the Hangover series. We already own part one and have seen all three in theaters together, so adding Part II to our collection was a no brainer. This was a great film to put on to get excited for our own wedding and bachelor/bachelorette festivities. It is laugh out loud funny. My husband and I can relate to this style of sarcastic humor. It may seem brash, or crude, but you can't please everyone.

Covers as tourist visit to Thailand pretty good.  From the 5 Star resorts to the cheaper hotels.  Been in both.  On my multiple tourist trips to Thailand I have never seen any drugs nor guns in Thailand.  And I traveled the gambit of 5 Star hotels to flop house hotels.  Does this happen in Thailand - well the country chosen here could have been any country.  All in all - a good snipit of life as a tourist in Thailand.  I would have not viewed the movie if it was not filmed in Thailand.

4346331,3,B004EPZ06Q,"The Hangover Part II is a sequel to the 2009 blockbuster hit The Hangover and the second film in The Hangover franchise. This time around,it tells the story of Phil,Stu,Alan and Doug when they travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. Just like Doug,Stu throws his own bachelor party before the wedding. But things do not go as planned and the group once again find themselves having no memories of the events of the previous night the following day.

Overall,the movie is visually dazzling,well-shot and obviously richer in personalities and characters. Unfortunately,it wasn't clever,refreshing and funny compared to the first film. It was practically almost the same too as the first film as the only difference happens to be that the bachelor party and the group who are at a lot are in Bangkok instead of Last Vegas. Despite the fact that it has a talented cast,it does not deliver enough laughter and humor to hold a candle to the first Hangover film.",1419724800,2,953,4.882716049382716

4346655,2,B004EPZ06Q,"What happens when a movie is wildly successful and you have legions of fans? Make a second installment, of course!

It doesn't matter if the premise was shaky to begin with, fans of the first one will come in droves to watch the second. That is undoubtedly the thinking behind this movie. ""Let's put out something to please the masses while making bank in the process"". Pretty much sums it up to a T. No real effort went into this movie. A good portion of it seemed like it was improvised, and poorly at that. There were several seems where the guys were standing around staring at each other for several awkward minutes. Yeah, because that's what I want to watch.

Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand. He grudgingly invites the other members of the wolf pack to be a part of his wedding. Thrown into the mix is the soon to be bride's younger brother. The five guys (wolf pack + younger brother) go down to a beach a few nights before the wedding and end up in the crazy ""Hangover"" scenario. They need to piece together what happened the night before, especially when the younger brother turns up missing.

This movie seemed like the original hangover in a new location without the laughs. I think there were two parts that actually made me laugh, the rest was simply me tiring of their ridiculous antics. The randomness of the first one was definitely lost on this film, mostly because it had already been done and was expected.

I haven't watched the third installment yet, but if it is anything like the second, I won't be missing anything if I decide not to.",1411862400,,1572,4.505263157894737

4346660,3,B004EPZ06Q,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the first half of the movie was hard to believe from an acting perspective.  The premise was kind of thrown at you and you were expected to just accept it.  The acting did not adequately support the plot.  By the second half, they had warmed up to each other and really seemed to be functioning as part of a true group of friends.  But before that it seemed awkward.  The Phil guy (as an actor) seemed more concerned with looking ""pretty"", than making himself believable as a genuine friend of these others. His character was not very believable.  Towards the end that changed as they all began to gel.  But I'm talking about gelling as actors, not in the movie. That is why the first half was slow and unconvincing. And that's why this gets 3 stars.  They need to do a better job of being pals.  So that the writing doesn't force you to believe it without support from the acting. Don't get me wrong, towards the end I was laughing pretty hard.  But they had to rely heavily on shock to sustain the movie due to a poor acting performance early on.  Compared to most movies I would give this 4 stars, but because it's part of a great franchise, I'll give it 3.",1410566400,2,1192,4.324324324324325

4347332,5,B004EPZ06Q,The story and plot are weak but you don't rent a movie like this for that. The gags and humor are worth the price of admission.,1394928000,,127,3.923076923076923
4347333,5,B004EPZ06Q,"Love The Hangover Series ( except #3) But Movie # 2 is very funny Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, and Ken Jeong are awesome in the movie",1394755200,,149,4.357142857142857

4347337,1,B004EPZ06Q,"This movie was just awful. The Hangover, the original one, was really good and really funny. I thought they might have a good thing going by putting out The Hangover Part 2. But it was as if they used the same plot for the first one but just plugged in different variables. The movie lacked imagination, initiative, and I didn't even finish watching it. What and utter disappointment.",1393891200,,384,4.661764705882353

4347594,5,B004EPZ06Q,An oral and cinematic history of everything that makes us laugh. Every character flawed and yet capable of overcoming the human condition that makes us enjoy life and the process of its challenges.

4347771,2,B004EPZ06Q,"When we watched The Hangover at the insistence of our 20 year old son, we were pleasantly surprised - probably because our expectations were so low. There were funny surprises and parts that doubled us over with laughter . Having said that, once is enough. There's nothing new to really capture the attention in The Hangover Part II. Watch the original and call it good enough. If you're offended by vulgar language, skip both.",1387756800,,427,4.783783783783784

4348065,1,B004EPZ06Q,"My wife and I both enjoyed the original movie, The Hangover. So we thought we would check out this sequel.

Wow. I am familiar with the general principle that sequels are rarely as good as the original film, but this...this...this movie is unbelievably abysmal. About an hour into it, my wife asked me ""Is this supposed to be funny?"" The story is horrible, the acting is phoned in, and the ""plot"" is banal. Where the first movie had so many laugh out loud moments, Part II just limped along like a dog that had been run over by a car but survived. I cannot fathom the thought process of the executives who signed off on this, or the test audiences who found it anything less than painful to watch.

I can honestly tell you I did not laugh once. Where the original was humorous, this sequel is just plain painful. The plot consists of Stu's impending nuptials in Thailand, a night that none of the friends can remember, a missing teenage boy, and one or two subplots that don't really ever come to fruition. The film is joyless and, at times, mean-spirited. Very sad.",1381104000,,1066,4.489690721649485

Are they funny things he does? Not often. But the ensembles he appeared with before Hangover II kept him buried far enough down in the mix that these glaring defects didn't show, while letting his weirdo-schtick persona do a few gags here and there.

The thing that ruined it for me was the photo sequence at the end. The photos were funny until the very last photo, which mocked a famous photo of an atrocious war crime.

Of course, when they wake up one of the four is missing (again !!!), so they set out to find him, this time in Thailand. Just to add a little much needed support to the now-thin concept the director throws in a monkey who goes everywhere with these immature duds. This might work in a circus or with an organ grinder, but in a movie we get tired of the monkey after two minutes. As in the first movie, these guys get into all sorts of mindless, stupid, moronic, and unimaginative situations that are supposed to have us laughing out of our seats, but instead make us wonder if the movie can just get any worse. And it does. If you are a ten-year-old you might find this screen disaster slightly funny. But if you are older, avoid this bomb at all costs. Not even the monkey could save this idiotic film.

A lot of people are complaining that this is the same plot as Hangover the first, and that's loosely accurate, but it's not the problem.  It's the jokes, there aren't enough actual jokes.

Hangover the first was rapid fire, clever, it even had a handful of multilevel Arrested Development style moments.  This movie had none of that, it relied on setting and a lot of semi-musical montage moments.

Allen does another tune for the situation, like his song for Doug in the first.

The characters are all back in Part II, but they should of gone elsewhere for a better movie script. The one person I TRULY HATED in this film, is actor Zach Galifianakis's character Alan, he was a down right rude, sad, whiny little sod. He kept being a total pain in the you know where, the way he kept staring at people, & the way he treated Teddy in the film, was ridiculous. How can this actor, play a moronic character that is so mean, rude, & just plain stupid? Onto the movie itself. It lost all of the first one's funny bone, 10-15 mins into it. I wanted to press the stop button on my Blu-Ray Remote, after the scene where Alan throws the neck comforter, or whatever it was, away at the Airport. The scene when they go to the Thailand Strip Bar, was disgusting. The whole film, had humour in it, that was never really funny.

4349624,3,B004EPZ06Q,"They set out to make a sequel and ended up making a remake, and an uninspired one at that. What made ""The Hangover"" - a 2009 surprise hit (and a Golden Globe winner) - so refreshing and fun is pretty much gone in ""The Hangover Part II."" The actors give all they got, and the exotic locations are nice to look at, but let's face it. The ""sequel"" is a virtual rehash of the original, if not poorly done, still mediocre.

So the Wolfpack is back. Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) return, but this time Stu is going to be married in Thailand, not in Las Vegas. And this time, not Doug, but the bride's brother Teddy (Mason Lee, Oscar winning film director Ang Lee's son) is missing.

Helmed by Todd Phillips, director of the original, ""The Hangover Part II"" tells almost the same story as its predecessor, with some minor differences. We are left with a feeling of ""we have seen it all already."" Or maybe we haven't, as the film's jokes are raunchier and even darker (with Ken Jeong returning as Mr. Chow), as if to cover up the fact that the film is running out of ideas.

This is not to say ""The Hangover Part II"" is a totally unfunny sequel, or remake, but for anyone who has enjoyed the original, this is simply an unnecessary entry. But they are making ""The Hangover Part III"" anyway, which I hope will be at least better than ""Part II.""",1367452800,2,1394,4.395348837209302

This is 100% proof that if you try to recreate what made the original so great without putting any writing effort into making the sequel funny or interesting and basically just copy what's already been done, the results will completely fall flat.

The Hangover Part II is a colossal disappointment.  One missed attempt at humor after another, including an adorable but unfunny and overused monkey, and the search for a friend that's eventually found in a location not *nearly* as compelling or interesting as in the first film.  Plus an overall noticeable rushed feeling to the writing that eventually severely hurts this one.  Let's not even mention the overbearing nude scenes that only spark a reaction of unbelievable shock and feeling grossed out.

4349761,3,B004EPZ06Q,"I would compare this to the Back to the Future movies in that the second and third installments recycled the same basic story and jokes. This is the first film in a new location, but with pretty much the same plot, many of the same jokes (or cruder variations on the jokes). Even the film makers stated that this one was too close to the first movie and have promised the third one will be different.

If you liked the first movie you will probably fall into one of two camps. You will either like this one, but not as enthusiastically as the first, or hate it because they just did the same story. If you were lukewarm to or did not like the first movie you will probably not like this one.  That is not to say that everyone will fall into one of those groups, but that seem to be where many people fall.  I know some love this movie as much or more than the first, and I know some are pretty indifferent to it.  That is really subjective to begin with.

The positives to this movie are that Zach Galifianakis gives another great performance, and the cast had the same great chemistry as in the first movie.  That ultimately why this one work to the extent that is does.  If you are okay with the fact that you are not going to get much originality from this one then it is worth buying or renting.

4349841,4,B004EPZ06Q,"The Hangover Part II tries so hard to be exactly like the first that it leaves nothing to the imagination and has no surprises what so ever! Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, it still has all its laugh out loud one liners, and of course Alan. What Part II doesn't have is originality. With a sequel, we want to see the same characters we love, in a similar, but different story. This movie parallels the original to the point where they are uttering the same lines in the same situation, just in another city. If you saw the first one, while watching this one, you're going to know where they go and what happens next. They have a great thing here with a ton of chemistry between the actors, but what they need to do is take it to the next level. I hear they have hired a screenwriter for a third chapter, let's hope they keep the laughter and change the story!",1361577600,,867,4.228915662650603

Granted it's basically the first film transposed into Bangkok but how awesome is it to juxtapose the glitter of Vegas with the squalor of Thailand? (The monk boner/monkey scene shows how much further they could have taken it) As in the first each cast member does an excellent job of contributing their brand of comedy to the film and I did not feel at all like the cast members where trying to one up each other.

4350055,3,B004EPZ06Q,"It's already been two years?  Holy wow, I can't believe how time flies!  In 2009, The Hangover became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time.  Rightfully so.  With a blend of unique characters, a funny premise, and shock value to boot; it was a homerun.  It catapulted Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis to stardom.  And it proved director Todd Phillips was a someone with longevity in this business.

The first movie followed the three main characters as they tried to find their lost friend after a night they couldn't remember.  The movie took place in Las Vegas and the city was a great backdrop to the story being told.  This time around, the ""Wolfpack"" finds themselves in a similar situation, only this time, they've lost a friend in Bangkok, Thailand.  Oh no... The Hangover II.

What I liked about the film:
The Wolfpack (including the monkey)

This is an obvious one.  Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis have an unbelievable chemistry together.  The three actors feed and play off of each other so well, they're totally believable in their roles.

Galifianakis steals most of the scenes again, as he did in the first film.  Helms plays the paranoid panic attack very well.  And the contrast to Helms is Bradley Cooper, who never seems to get phased by anything.  Ken Jeong and Paul Giamatti round out some great supporting characters as well.  And don't forget about the much talked about monkey.  Baby Carlos has NOTHING on the cigarette smoking, drug dealing monkey in the sequel.  It was cleverly worked into the film and actually served a purpose in the plot.  Great!

The setting

Vegas was a great place to setup the last film.  It just made sense for the guys to wake up in their hotel room, not remembering much.  This time, they pushed the envelope.  Thailand is so visually busy, the movie will need a second viewing to catch everything.  Tying in Jeong's character into the setting was great.  Watching the movie, you got a real sense of how difficult it was for the cast and crew to work in such busy conditions.  I've read interviews with director, Phillips, where he says it was his most difficult shoot to date.

The one-liners, memorable

I hate when I go to a movie and leave not recalling a thing.  That wasn't the case with this film.  My wife and I left the theater repeating one-liner after the other.  I am well aware of all the criticisms of the film being identical to the first (I'll get to that in a minute), but the movie is very memorable and will hold up against a lot of other comedies out there.

What I didn't like about the film:
Sub-plot
I find myself disliking a lot of film sub-plots.  It's because it feels like the movie wouldn't have suffered if they took it out completely.  Without giving anything away, the sub-plot involves Jeong and Giamatti's characters.  The writers used it as a device to take the main characters from one place to the next, but once the sub-plot is revealed in full, there's no pay off.  I didn't like it and wished they would have written it out of the movie.

The Verdict:
Loved it, KNOWING what I was walking into

I think people just wanted to hate the film.  ""It's exactly like the first one.""  ""They couldn't have thought of anything better?""  Interesting how you weren't criticizing the movie while laughing so hard I couldn't hear the dialogue.  Look, the first trailer showed us all that it was going to have the EXACT same format as the first film.  So I knew what I was getting myself into and was very content with it.  To me, it was fresh and funny in ways the first one wasn't; and it was enough to satisfy my hunger for another grown-up comedy after Bridesmaids.  Check out The Hangover II, you will not be disappointed!",1356220800,2,3727,4.591185410334346

If potty humor and crudeness aren't your cup of tea - you probably hated the first Hangover.  If you like a belly laugh with a couple new variations on the same type of theme, you'll enjoy this one.

My partner and I really enjoyed both of the Hangover movies and are looking forward to Hangover III.  The chemistry between the cast is a lot of fun.

4350327,3,B004EPZ06Q,"I readily admit I was curious to watch this sequel of the hilariously successful original; I wanted to see if the filmmakers could come up with some original material to make the guys' second black out believable.  Alas, THE HANGOVER PART II is a retread--and often a tired retread--only here the raunch is vigorously ratcheted up.  From missing digits to drug overdose to transgendered shenanigans to Mike Tyson tweaking supreme annoyance with ease, this sequel definitely bends the envelope, and does have some laugh-out-loud moments, but if you've seen (and enjoyed) the original offering you can rest assured there is really no new ground covered in the sequel.

The original foursome (Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis) return as Phil, Doug, Stu, and Alan; and this time Stu is wedding an Asian/American girl (Jamie Chung) in her native Thailand.  Stu wants no part of a bachelor party, yet upon arrival to the Orient he consents to the guys having one beer on the beach--and naturally the guys (sans Doug, who we discover leaves the get-together early and returns to the hotel, but adding Stu's future brother-in-law Teddy, played by Mason Lee) wake up the next morning in a rundown hotel in Bangkok with no memory of the night before, and missing young Teddy.  Of course, this sequel wouldn't be complete without the antics of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), who once again makes his appearance in all his natural glory.  Thus the manhunt for Teddy commences, as Stu, Phil, and Alan slowly piece together the events of a very busy evening, augmented by a faux ransom fronted by an undercover cop (Paul Giamatti), and, as before, just as the wedding appears doomed Stu solves the mystery, Teddy is found, there's a mad scramble to get back in time for the wedding, with (another)dramatic entrance.  And as if this sequel hasn't borrowed from its predecessor enough, Stu once again gets to ping another person, only this time it's his future father-in-law (Nirut Sirichanya).  Again, there are very funny moments to THE HANGOVER PART II, and all the antics are delivered as vigorously as before, but a retread is a retread is a retread.  So my curiosity is satisfied--my indifference is not.

***************SPOILER ALERT***************

How humorless is this movie? Here's one example that pretty much sums up this whole, unfunny mess. At one point Ed Helms' character learns that while he was under the influence of some memory-erasing drugs, he willfully participated in an unprotected sexual act with a pre-operative, male transexual. (whose ""equipment"" we have the displeasure of actually seeing) We find out in graphic detail that while the thankfully unseen act itself involved a ""happy ending"" for both participants, as it turns out, Helms' character, a heterosexual, was on the receiving end of this act, if you know what I mean. There is no humor in this revelation whatsoever but Helms' character sings about the event later on in the movie as though it were something he thought to be amusing enough to actually joke around about. Really? That's funny?! Can someone, can ANYONE tell me when sad and disturbing became an acceptable substitute for actual humor because I swear, I did NOT get that memo.",1339372800,2,1023,5.089285714285714

I think director Todd Philips succeeded by making a continuation of the first film and not a cynical copy of it.  Plotwise there are similarities netween the two films but Philips gives some panache to the proceedings of the follow up.  By relocating the action to the locale of Thailand Philips imbues some exoticism to the ribaldry.  I laughed out loud consistently throughout the film.  Mike Tyson offers an amusing cameo and Ken Jeong as the flamboyant Chow practically steals the show.  My wife liked the cigarette smoking monkey sporting a Rolling Stones jacket.

4350551,5,B004EPZ06Q,"I give the Hangover Part 2 five out of 5 stars because each friend has a unique relatable personality, the dialog of this film was hilarious, and there is suspense throughout the whole movie.

I watched The Hangover Part 2 this summer while it was still in theaters. I loved it so much and thought it was so outstanding that I went back three other times. When it was available on DVD I was sure to purchase it.

This movie is the sequel to The Hangover. It is about 4 friends who have what was supposed to be a small and quiet bachelor party which turns into a night to remember. The guys wake up the morning after and are completely oblivious to what happened the previous night. They begin to back track while trying to hide what's happened from the groom to be's fiance. They encounter many situations from angry monks to singing professional boxers.

This film was so spectacular because each friend was easy to relate to in some way. Each of their personalities and curiosity made for an eventful film.
The dialog of this film is very intriguing. In some scenes they say the most random things while using very intelligent vocabulary and it somehow works together making the viewers laugh nonstop.

Along with the hilarious dialog, there was never a dull moment. Something is always unexpectedly making you chuckle. There is always a situation needing to be solved.
Although this was an excellent movie, it could have been better if the Main Character from the following movie, Doug, was involved more in the events.

This movie was crude, rude, and just fantastic is so many ways. If you've seen the first one 1 highly recommend you purchase the sequel.  I've seen it uncountable times and I laugh just as hard every single time I put it into my DVD player.",1333497600,5,1764,4.601910828025478
4350552,1,B004EPZ06Q,"*1/2

There's barely a laugh to be had in ""The Hangover - Part 2,"" a dreadful sequel to the original box office smash from 2009.

This time the boys - and I do mean ""boys"" - are trapped in Thailand, where they've gone to celebrate Stu's nuptials and where they immediately fall into a series of misadventures after a riotous night of bachelor party celebration in Bangkok, all of which has been mysteriously erased from their collective memory.

I wish I could say that, from all this, hilarity ensues. But I would be lying.  As with most big-budget studio comedies these days, the tone and the performances are pitched so over-the-top that the audience winds up feeling assaulted rather than entertained long before the closing credits come rolling by.  To that end, the  screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.

The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's ""Community"" - have been added to the cast.

By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - ""The Hangover - Part2"" is a colossal bomb.",1333324800,4,1504,4.870588235294117
4350553,2,B004EPZ06Q,"Two stars is really to generous!  I think this is one of the worse sequels ever.  It brings nothing new to the table.  Talk about a pitiful sequel.  They didn't even bother to write a new story.  It is basically the same story minus the humor.  It is so bad.  I don't think there is a single scene as good as one in the first movie.  I also wonder why no bad guys in the movie were Thai only foreigners as they call them in Thailand.  If you've seen the first movie,  I'd say this movie is a 1 star.  If you didn't see the first maybe you could give it a 2 stars, because it may seem a little funny.",1331856000,,599,3.8677685950413223
4350554,5,B004EPZ06Q,This movie is hysterical.  I have watched it over and over because you always catch something you missed the first time around.  Great laughs!,1331596800,,142,4.875
4350555,2,B004EPZ06Q,"The boys are ready for another bachelor party and this time beautiful Thailand plays host to the gang of irresponsible nitwits. It's Stu's turn to get married (Didn't he marry a hooker in the original film?) Jamie Chung plays his lovely Thai-American bride Lauren. Her parents are planning a beautiful wedding in Thailand. Stu invites his best buddies Phil and Doug to join him but this time the bachelor party will be dinner at IHOP. No more shenanigans for Stu. He has a conservative future father-in-law to impress. After what happened in Las Vegas, Alan is out of the picture until Stu is convinced to invite him along. Is Thailand ready for this gang?

Alan promises to behave but an impromptu bonfire party for the guys at the beach goes wrong--very wrong. The guys are joined by Lauren's teeange brother teddy. Of course, the next thing we know, Stu, Phi and Alan wake up in a strange Bangkok hotel with no idea of what happened. They've lost Teddy but gained a monkey and somehow the mysterious Mr. Chow is with them. There is one more item of note in the room but I won't spoil the surprise.

The humor quickly turns dark and even more raunchy and vulgar as the guys try to figure out what happened last night and desperately try to find Teddy who may be ""lost to Bangkok"" which must mean he'll never be seen again. The guys's fill in bits and pieces of their lost memories and end up with a Buddhist monk, a facial tattoo, a destroyed bar...should I go on?

I felt bad for Thailand that such a silly movie was filmed in their lovely country. Although the wedding is taking place at a beautiful seaside area, the guys end up in a seedy and ugly part of Bangkok. I found several things distasteful about this film. The monkey is shown smoking and ""works"" for criminals. The item found in the hotel room that I have not mentioned specifically is such a major issue and it is taken lightly. It's bad news for that item to be there. Stu has unprotected sex with a Thai prostitute and there is no mention of consequences except that he ""cheated"" on his future wife and obviously has a thing for prostitutes. Be prepared for an extra surprise in that part of the story.

Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow, a rather embarrassing character and a not very politically correct protrayal of an Asian character. Chow is something out of a bad comic book. Just looking and listening to him makes you want to cringe. Bradley Cooper is back as the pretty boy of the group. Justin Bartha has a smaller roll in this film as Doug.

HANGOVER II could have made better use of the beautiful Thai scenery. The raunch could have been toned down. Alan is so much trouble yet he gets to come along and chaos ensures. The way the monkey is presented disturbed me and the whole story of the extra item in the hotel is unnerving because of the ramifitcations which are barely mentioned later. You have to watch the credits to see that pictures of the night that were taken to get some explanation of the mysterious item.

Good:

There are some good jokes and the interaction between the guys is still hilarious. There is great chemistry with these guys and it delivers in this movie too.

More than once it had me laughing loudly. It does have some really great moments, and a couple of shockers.

Chow steals the show in this one I think, and giving him more time was definitely worth it.

Another song from Ed Helms that is hilarious.

You get to see the story continue for the guys.

Bad:

It's a sequel so you can't avoid the constant comparisons in your mind.

Its a repeat of the formula almost exactly (though most of us expected that).

The ending was crap.

The jokes were re-used, sometimes the EXACT joke was re-used as if we wouldn't remember it.

Mike Tyson's acting doesn't get any better, he's a distraction and kind of annoying.

I found myself walking away trying to figure out how this movie made it into the public without an NC-17 rating. I suppose they are becoming more liberal with the rating boards. There are too many funny moments to pick just one. Needless to say this is a must see for fans of the first one, but at the same time some of the more light hearted folks may want to pass it up.

Yes it's the same but more realized and capitalizes on what made the first film great. Now I know this does not always work, take a sequel like Grease II or Jaws II which are not really comedies...well Jaws II was pretty funny considering how bad it was compared to the first.

I actually enjoyed this one a little more, I think because of the Thailand setting. Personally I could use a little more Bradley Cooper and less Zach Galifianakis, but that may just be me:-) In this one, Ed Helms is getting married in Thailand - his wife's family is from there - at a lovely beachside resort. Although not planning to party, through a mysterious set of circumstances (which we later learn of) a beachside beer turns into a complete blackout night, with Helms/Cooper/Galifiankis's characters waking up in Bangkok in a dreadful state, and missing the bride's 15-year old brother (whose finger appears to be in an ice bucket next to him.) So sets the stage for the movie. They set out to find him, and get back to the resort in time for the wedding, and in the process start to remember and retrace the events of the night before.

Plenty of funny moments ensue - dark humor of course. I think everyone plays their parts well, and it's a solid sequel, good for some laughs.

However, if you watched The Hangover I then you should already be prepared for crude humor, even if it is a bit over the top. Just be prepared. You'll laugh, just not as often.
The boys are just as funny as ever, though I would have to say, the script really didn't give them a lot of room for that easy going friendship they seemed to have in the first movie. I was a little disappointed that they seemed to have lost that spark, but it's a rare sequel that is remotely as good as the first. That said, this sequel was better than some other sequels I've been unlucky enough to have paid to see.
A little warning to the ladies out there: Should you watch this movie and get offended, remember that it's guy humor! This movie wasn't made to leave you feeling good and sappy inside! It's made to leave you feeling like you've just been shocked and awed, and a little queasy feeling LOL And if anything in the movie itself offended you, for heavens sake, whatever you do DO NOT watch the end credits!",1326844800,,1120,4.238317757009346
4350943,1,B004EPZ06Q,"There was little doubt that there would be a sequel to the hit 2009 comedy about a group of friends trying to put together the pieces of an alcohol soaked night in Las Vegas. Hollywood is first and foremost a business and no one is going to pass up the opportunity to squeeze more money out of a popular commodity. What's so frustrating about The Hangover Part II is the complete lack of anything resembling creativity or originality on the part of everyone involved. This movie is one of the most blatant examples of ""phoning it in"" that I have ever seen.

The plot is an exact replica of the first film. Once again the wolf pack (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galafranakas) find themselves hung-over after a wild night of partying (this time in Thailand) and working to figure out what happened. I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well. Even the cast doesn't seem to be having as much fun this time around.

If you saw the first movie, skip this one since it is merely a faded copy of the much funnier original. If you haven't seen it then watch it and forget about this lame excuse to cash in at the box office.

Was everyone in some sort of bad mood when they watched this or something?

Myself and everyone i viewed it with laughed hysterically throughout the entire thing. Sure the premise was basically the same as the first but what were you expecting,high drama?! What sequel isn't similar to the original? If it ain't broke you know. If it hadn't been similar people like myself would have probably been disappointed about that,so what are you going to do?

These guys are old enough to know better, and should be smarter, well all but the chubby guy who never grew up, but they aren't, and the keep on partying long after their brains have gone to bed.  I've done that, and I've lived to talk, so far, and I don't want to do that again, but it can make for some funny stories.  So we're not talking great cinema, but it should still be funny.  Where Hangover II outshines Hangover I is that there are funny parts that weren't in the trailer.  Every single funny part of Hangover I was in the trailer and nothing was left for the remaining ninety minutes.  Otherwise, both films follow the same format:  Someone is supposed to get married, and the guys lose someone and the rest of the movie is spent looking for him;  along the way we learn most of what happened the night before, and what we don't learn is hilariously filled in at the end, in photographs that someone took...

However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens. And while a member of the party is, again, missing, this time it's his future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) who is nowhere to be found. And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.

  I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of `green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a ""green comedy"". Whatever esthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film.",1326499200,,1305,5.1753554502369665

Maybe I just needed a good laugh, or maybe I just accepted Hangover II for what it was... entertainment. I wasn't expecting any Oscar performances; I simply wanted mindless, stomach splitting humor which is what I got. The Hangover II proved for several hours of good fun. I personally thought this one was just as funny as the first. I mean what could be more hilarious as Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Mike Tyson singing. Anyway, Stu is planning on marrying Lauren (the love of his life). Initially he invites all of his friends, with the exception of Alan, to come join him in Thailand for the upcoming nuptials. But succumbing to pressure from Phil and Doug, Stu finally invites Alan to join them, which would prove to be the first in a series of steps that lead to quite the adventure.

Once they arrive in Thailand, Stu has to deal with Lauren's father (who hates him and takes every opportunity to demean his future son-in-law); Alan's jealousy of Lauren's kid brother Teddy (a genius and Stanford Med Student); and Phil's attempts to plan a bachelor party. After all he remembers Las Vegas and doesn't want anything like that to happen again. As luck would have it, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in Bangkok with (again) no memory of the events from the night before. The only things they know for sure is that (1) Stu now has a large tattoo on his face (that strongly resembles the one Mike Tyson sports); (2) they now are responsible for a monkey (who smokes and does other hilarious things); (3) Teddy, Lauren's little brother is now missing and all they have left of him is a finger with his class ring; (4) they are a long way from where they should be and must get Stu and Teddy back in time for the wedding; (5) Alan is bald; (6) Mr. Chow is still involved in some questionable things; (6) there is a monk, who has taken a vow of silence who witnessed the events from the previous night; and (7) they are in a great deal of trouble. It would seem that the Las Vegas events are tame compared to what they are don't remember experiencing in Bangok.

4351734,3,B004EPZ06Q,"Try to imagine the original Hangover and blending it with 'Apocalypse Now'. Mix well and serve.

Very roller coaster. The laughs were gut busters, but the lulls in between were interminable and often horrifyingly dull - like the first twenty minutes of the film. How can you spend wholly 1/5th of your movie in the set-up? That was the first sign that this wasn't going to be a repeat performance of their amazing first effort.

Although the formula was the same, there's a dank undercurrent, a pitifulness that's built up as we watch these muckers go about one twisted situation after another.

The script replaced hilarity with shock, humor with the bizarre. Lost from the first film was the genuine sense of discovery. Also lost - a great deal of emotional sincerity - as we no longer feel like one of the gang and more like detached observers to their antics.

The hysterical comic lunacy of the first film is replaced by plain lunacy with comical asides. This gives ""II"" a grungy edge and less a comedic one. Certainly not a formula for repeat success.

Again, the one element that had me scratching my head was the overall atmosphere of the film; many of the scenes seem gritty and unpolished. Not sure what Director Todd Phillips was attempting? I honestly expected a half-naked Martin Sheen to walk out of the hotel getting ready to face Colonel Kurtz in the jungle. And maybe that wouldn't have been such a bad idea, because the Mike Tyson cameo really lacked oomph this time around.

And speaking of cameos and a Sheen - how did they miss getting Charlie to appear? C'mon! That should have been a gimme; a massive lost opportunity for this production, which needed every trick in the book to work. You can't tell me a free trip and fully funded Yum-Yum City excursion wouldn't have interested his Warlockness.

Honestly? I get the sense this was an extended party for the production crew, staff and actors - and they just happened to do a movie on the side.

Definitely suffers from the sophomore jinx. Rent it for the one-time laughs.",1325548800,,2045,4.676880222841226
4351735,2,B004EPZ06Q,"The idea of a sequel to the 2009 film The Hangover was a welcome one after having caught audiences off-guard with its hilarious situations in Las Vegas while raking in the cash to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all-time. The characters were likable on their own and had great chemistry together so the thought of following them further absolutely made sense.

In the lead-up to The Hangover: Part II however there was concern regarding the appearance that the plot would be a carbon copy of the original. Unfortunately that was largely realized, and despite a number of big laughs the movie feels uninspired and all too familiar.

The setting has changed to Thailand but the scenarios are largely the same. A bachelor party spins out of control and the guys wake up not remembering a thing about the night and realizing someone is missing. From there it is a race around the city as they try to put the pieces together. Substitute monkey for baby for easy reactionary laughs and so on.

The majority of the developments parallel what took place in the first film to a frustrating degree. Being unable to overlook that it made each and every reveal feel forced. Surprises really didn't feel as though they were surprises and ultimately they all led to predictable conclusions. Even the new locale didn't really add much to the story but to provide the backdrop as they raced around without largely inhibiting their efforts.

If just one unexpected thing took place it's that I came away having really enjoyed Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow despite not having cared for the character in the first movie. All the other actors were playing their roles identical to the first except for Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who was quite mean-spirited early on and that felt somewhat out of place and distracting.

As much as its familiarity hampered its potential The Hangover II was still full of laughs and I can't overlook that entirely. The main problem is that these characters just can't shock me anymore regardless of what they get themselves into. In fact by the end I started to dread the prospect of them in a third film attempting to top the first two. The photos during the credits sequence though were genuinely funny yet again and almost made the whole thing worthwhile on their own. When the credit sequence is the highlight that isn't a sign of a good film however.

You pretty much know what you're going to get with The Hangover II, an enjoyable but unoriginal follow-up, and for such a popular comedy that may be just enough to entice audiences and satisfy the masses who don't necessarily care for anything more.",1325548800,,2622,4.76431718061674

4352099,2,B004EPZ06Q,"I'm assuming anyone who watched Hangover II has watched the first Hangover movie, which I found hilarious.  The second installment of the Hangover, is so bad it can't even be classified as a comedy, and I mean that sincerely.  This movie could be a second rate action movie, but to classify it as a comedy is false advertising.

The boys are back, Bradley Cooper(Phil), Ed Helms(Stu), Doug(Justin Bartha) and last, and with the worse acting gig in the history of acting, Alan(Zach Galifianakis), but the all the good scriptwriters seem to have taken a vacation.

I found Alan to be so repulsive as to be unbelievable, and the fact that Phil, Stu trust him again, is beyond the pale.  Of course they get in trouble again by way of Alan, or there wouldn't be a movie, but maybe that's the point, there shouldn't have been another movie, or maybe it should have been from the ladies point of view this time, anything other than what happened in this movie.

In the first movie, Alan's pranks were charming, in this second movie, he is so out there, that all I could think is that he should be put in a mental institution for the criminally insane.  Zach's character is so toxic, that it was all I could do to watch him on the screen.  Didn't he read the script?  Isn't part of being talented, being able to imagine how your character will turn out?  I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch this man in a movie again.

---spoiler alert-----

The addition of Stu's finance's brilliant little brother might have been a nice touch, except that they had him lose a finger and that allowed this brilliant musician, and aspiring surgeon to bond with the 'wolf pack' idiots, allowing him to smile for the first time in his life.  What????

Then there's the ending, Stu's finance's father hates him, as well the man should.  Stu is the coward he's accused of being, and when he finally stands up to his future father-in-law, the man accepts him, as if being and a** makes a person more noble.  Why Stu's fiance even considered dating him in the first place, is unbelievable to the extreme.

It's hard to believe that you can take the cast from the original Hangover, one of the funniest movies of all time, place them in a similar scenario and produce a movie so awful that fully one-half of all viewers give it a ONE STAR rating.

WARNING: ADULT SUBJECT MATTER....I place the majority of the blame on a thoroughly lousy ""plot"" and dialog that contains numerous wince-inducing, downright revolting scenes which are completely devoid of any real humor. For example: One of the main characters is the drunken (but willing) recipient of anal sex by a female impersonator and then, to make matters even worse, we are treated to several shots of the offending ""equipment"" and a graphic discussion of the exchange of fluids that occurred. Are there really people in the world who consider this to be hysterically funny? There weren't any around when I saw the movie, unless groans of disgust and asking for refunds are a new type of laughter.

Such humorless sensory shocks are delivered repeatedly, until you are almost (mercifully) numb, and then, just when you thought your suffering might be over, Mike Tyson shows up to deliver the single worst, most off-key, god-awful rap performance in the history of recorded sound. If this movie were shown in a prison, it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Instead, it is foisted on the public by a group of people who HAD to realize just how awful it was, and yet released it anyway....for money.

As my other reviews will indicate, I am no prude and love a good gross-out if it is hysterically funny, but disgusting, juvenile dialog and behavior without any redeeming humor are simply disgusting....and definitely not worth your time and money.

Or rather, I did (I was in college when the first film came out), but it still didn't impress me all that much.  That said, when I checked the Amazon reviews a few weeks ago, I thought that surely people were exaggerating their criticisms of Part II.  Most of the complaints seemed to be about the unoriginality of the script.  And, yes, it follows the original premise almost completely:  Ed Helms sings a song about halfway through, and it ends with incriminating photos discovered on a phone.  Oh, those crazy cell phone pics.

But none of that bothers me.  It's a franchise about hangovers - the options aren't so numerous.  The real problem is that the film is just lame.  Really lame.  The performances feel completely telegraphed, so I think even the actors might have agreed.  Nobody is looking for Shakespearean depth in a flick with a cigarette smoking monkey, but signs that they're actually interested in their lines wouldn't hurt.

In short: the attempts at outlandish humor result more often in eye rolls than laughs.  It's all so tired, and there is a complete lack of new ideas.  The movie is at its most pathetic when the writers finally just have one of the characters get shot.  Sure, why not?  That's funny, right?!  The first film made a gazillion dollars, and now all involved have decided to ride this cash cow for all it's worth.  Part III is due out in 2013, and I'm sure it will pull in the big bucks, too.

4352242,1,B004EPZ06Q,"Wish I could have taken a couple of Alan's roofies so I couldn't remember this movie.

Most sequels are really an excuse to remake the first film but with less originality in hopes of capturing much of the same audience. There are exceptions of course to this rule; ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Aliens"", ""Spider-Man II"" are all popular movies where the sequel measured up to or outdid the first film that sparked it all but for every sequel that's good to exceptional there's 10 more that are just plain awful.

""The Hangover II"" belongs to the latter category. It's bad, really bad except for two brief inspired sequences that the rest of the film hangs off of like a poorly cut suit.

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with colors that pop, nice, sharp detail and depth but no matter how well you dress up a pig, it's still a pig or, in this case, a turd.

Audio also sounds great with a nice 5.1 lossless audio mix has plenty of kick for a comedy and puts you right in the middle of the action.

We get an ""unauthorized"" documentary by a ""budding"" filmmaker to uncover what REALLY went on during the shooting of the movie. It's funnier than most of the movie. Seriously.

We also get featurettes on the director's style, shooting on location in Thailand, the monkey, ""Action Mash-Up"" which pointlessly compiles some of the action scenes from the movie, a very unfunny gag reel and a DVD with a copy of the movie (let's not even discuss what appears to be the reviled Ultraviolet ""digital copy""). Unlike most folks I could care less about the ""Ultraviolet"" copy because I don't think I'll be watching this again. I'd rather watch paint dry. The fumes would be more entertaining than this film.

""The Hangover Part II"" does everything WRONG that the first movie did right and, with the exception of two amusing brief sequences is a complete waste of time. The film proves you can't go again or at least to Thailand without duplicating the same plot as the first film.

I'd suggesting watching this only if it's free. Is there anyway I can get my two hours back?

A summary of the plot follows (it'll save you two hours trust me on this).

The plot is roughly the same as the first film except this time Stu (Ed Helms)is getting married (what happened to his first wife the stripper? We're never told). Stu has invited his friends Doug (Justin Bartha completely wasted here) and Phil (Bradley Cooper)his foul mouthed teacher buddy. Stu ends up inviting Alan (Zach Galifianakis)when he's pressured by Doug to his nuptials in Thailand. To insure that nothing goes wrong Stu has just one beer with his buddies but, of course, everything goes wrong. Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a dive in Bangkok where they discover they've partied with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong)and lost Stu's brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee).",1324166400,9,2806,4.650505050505051

I was disappointed because they basically used the same script, which was somewhat expected as I heard they were going to keep it similar by going by the old saying, ""if it aint broke, don't fix it"".  With that said, the movie was very VERY predictable. A lot of the same scenes such as waking up in a hotel room not remembering anything, another missing buddy, another wedding they're late for, another song by Stew, another bad guy who holds their friend hostage, another SOS call to Doug's wife at the beginning and end, another late entrance to the wedding, another Asian full frontal, I could go on and on. They made poor Alan's jokes and humor over the top to the point where they weren't really that funny which is sad since Alan is probably the best character.

It's almost like the original creators were in a big hurry to make No. 2 that they just made the exact same movie in a different location. I KNOW it's a Part II, but it's like a re-make of the first one. It pissed me off that this movie was put off from being sold on DVD for so long like it's actually going to be worth the wait and anticipation. Huge FAIL.

So, it has some laughs, not as many as the first movie, but there are some laugh-out loud moments.

4352692,3,B004EPZ06Q,"Todd Phillips' 2009 comic masterpiece, ""The Hangover,"" resurrected the raunchy comedy with its brilliantly demented ""lost weekend"" in Vegas. Despite the top-notch work of the ensemble cast, Zach Galifianakis stole the show more completely than any actor since we walked away from ""High Fidelity"" raving about Jack Black.

Even before the release of ""The Hangover,"" which made a bazillion dollars at the box office, a sequel was in the works. The great news is that almost the entire gang is back from Vegas and now heads to Bangkok in the sequel, ""The Hangover Part II."" Doug (Justin Bartha) is comfortably married and Stu (Ed Helms) is taking the plunge with Lauren (Jamie Chung), whose family still lives in Thailand. Stu wants nothing more than a quiet wedding, and he wisely spends his bachelor party at brunch. Unfortunately, Stu brings Alan (Galifianakis) along for the wedding, against his better instincts. With Alan in tow, one should expect accidental mayhem to follow, and it does.

In spades.

Once again the boys find themselves awakening with blinding hangovers, blank memories, and a missing friend. Once again, they spend the movie resurrecting what went on the night before, and each discovered secret is more deranged than the one before. Dead bodies. Severed fingers. Toking monkeys. Enraged Buddhist monks. The list goes on and on, and the laughs do indeed pile up.

And yet, one cannot escape the fact that the entire movie is a slightly less funny retread of the original. From the narrative structure (both films start with a phone call to a distressed significant other) to the craziness to the jokes, we've heard this song before. Despite the great comic performances -- Galifianakis alone is worth the rental fee -- and clever use of the Bangkok reputation for depravity, the latest ""Hangover"" is as original and inspiring as its title.

Here's hoping that the upcoming ""Hangover Part III"" takes the boys on an entirely new journey to the wild side.

I bought both of the Hangover movies anticipating an enjoyable back to back escape from reality after having surgery and taking my pain meds. While the first one barely passed for humor, this movie actually had very little to do with humor and IMHO the actors should have refused to do the material as it is so stupid. I didn't laugh during the film and I was under medication. The acting/actors in this film are the worst and I'm pretty sure they will not be seen again for even going along with this plot. If you think you want to waste the time to watch either of the Hangover movies wait for a few weeks as these things will be selling for $1.00 in the bargain bins.",1323561600,2,757,4.227586206896552

If you've heard or read anything about the movie, you know that the typical summary offered is ""It's pretty much the same as the first one, except that it takes place in Thailand."" This time around, it's Stu who's getting married, so the gang travels back to his fiancee's homeland for the festivities, and again, it's Alan who inadvertently brings about another forgotten night of mayhem that the fellas must piece together the day after.

First, it is not accurately advertised. You do not get a ""Digital Copy"". A digital copy means that you own a copy of the film in digital format by legal means and you can load it onto your devices and watch it legally regardless of whether or not if you have an internet connection when you watch. What is advertised as a ""digital copy"" here (aka Ultraviolet) is simply a login access to a website where you stream the movie from. So if you are on an airplane, no movie. If you are not in a WiFi connected environment, no movie. If your connection slows, no movie. If you are paying per MB for internet access or have a fixed data plan, you will have the movie but will either pay as much as buying it from iTunes if you exceed your limits. This is a wonderful example of how a technology that has proved wonderful (i.e. true digital copy) can be turned into a disaster (i.e. ultraviolet), all in the name of corporate greed from Warner Brothers.

In the past I've always ordered versions with digital copies even if it means a few extra $$ as I would gain a copy for my iTunes library. Recently, though, Warner has gotten on the Ultraviolet bandwagon. Ultraviolet is a somewhat clunky online service that manages your copy for you. While you do technically receive a digital copy, you cannot import it to anything other than the Ultraviolet library. Those of us who enjoy the iTunes crossover will be sorely disappointed.

Lessons learned? Yes, and they are two-fold. First, when Amazon lists the movie with digital copy initially, there has not been an indication that the digital copy was any different than in the past. The 'Ultraviolet Digital Copy' that now appears in the header is new to those of us who placed the order early. In a sense, we're not getting what we've ordered. To be fair, this is NOT Amazon's fault. I'm also certain that they would accept a return/cancel the order for the simple reason that you won't get what you were expecting. So, the lesson here is to watch for the studio that is releasing the movie and keep in mind that they are likely employing Ultraviolet, and then act according to your preference even if the initial indication is that your copy is simply digital or Ultraviolet digital.

Second, figure out whether you mind Ultaviolet. Clearly, there is enough of an outcry against it that it appears Warner is making its customers unhappy. Protest by not buying the slightly marked up version with the digital copy and continue to lower the ranking here, which is clearly the case with the last Potter film considering the overwhelming number of single-star rankings. I'm still too dearly attached to the idea of having a copy to watch on my iPod or iPad so Ultraviolet remains a far, far inferior solution to the digital copy question. Will it stop me from buying versions with Ultraviolet digital copies? Maybe - but sometimes the difference in cost is very small, if we even have a choice in blu ray versions of the film.

Regardless, this is simply a move toward greater proprietorial behavior on the part of digital media providers. As much as technology opens up tremendous opportunities for crossover, it's only a matter of time before someone decides that they aren't making enough money or that they are losing too much control over their product, and then moves to change the rules, ultimately to the displeasure of the consumer. More one star reviews are likely on the way as we are persuaded less by the content and more by the 'packaging'.",1323043200,7,2632,4.75492341356674

4353486,3,B004EPZ06Q,"The first HANGOVER was a bit of comedy genius: a film featuring three guys most people hadn't yet heard of, in raunchy situations that would normally alienate a large part of the general audience.  Yet it was a hit, because it had a quality that so many comedies today lack: it was funny.  Director Todd Phillips and company were unafraid to ""go there,"" to push buttons and risk offending people, all in the name of comedy.

HANGOVER PART II is pretty much the same, except this time the guys are in Bangkok, and there's a drug-dealing monkey.  Even Mr. Chow is back, although his character really isn't important (Ken Jeong provides quite a bit of humor, but we're always painfully aware he was brought back to satisfy fans).  Paul Giamatti has a nice bit, as does Nick Cassavetes (in a role originally intended for Mel Gibson, then Liam Neeson; it would have been nice to see either actor in the roll, but Cassavetes is good).  The leads are as solid as they were in the first film; their elevated star status hasn't diminished their ability to deliver quality performances.

It seems like I'm harping on the film; and in many ways, this harping is justified. HANGOVER broke new comedic ground; it wasn't revolutionary, but it was unique among modern comedy films.  HANGOVER PART II doesn't do this; it is a retreading of the first film, from the basic plot point (to be expected) to some of the more minor details (which makes things much too predictable in spots).  There are some memorable bits (a stripper surprise, which pushes the envelope, and Giamatti's ever-reliable presence), but ultimately HANGOVER PART II melds with the first film, becoming the weaker second act.  This isn't a horrible thing (it's still funny; note the 3 stars), but it's somewhat disappointing, considering the quality of its predecessor.",1322956800,,1823,4.832797427652733

I will be curious what the third disc will contain since this being a WB BD/DVD set with UV B.S. copy does not require a separate disc just a code.

The reason I ordered this and other WB bluray combo packs is mainly for the DVD.  You can download a physical copy of movies on to your iOS device and it will playback without an Internet connection, but my beef with WB, the owners of Flixster BTW (surprise surprise) is that the copy has such a low bit rate that it makes it pretty much unwatchable except on an iPhone.  Now I am not saying that the usual digital copies were spectacular, but at least they were DVD quality.  The iTunes copies usually supplied are on average 1.5 to 2gb files. But the UV copies they give to playback on an iOS device clock in at a pathetic sub 500mb in size.  Some people rip thier own copy (nothing I would do) wink wink.  If the other studios start to release UV copies, I predict most will make thier own.

Bangkok instead of Vegas. A tatoo instead of losing a tooth.  I think the main problem with this movie is that the first one came out of nowhere and surprised everyone with how funny it was.  After making a ton of money a sequel had to be made.  The only problem is that this type of movie doesn't lend itself to a sequel.  So they did they only thing they could.  I would call this more of a remake then a sequel, and much like all remakes it's not as good as the original.  Overall, very disapointing after the classic first one.  I give it a B-.

I will NEVER buy an ULTRAVIOLET so-called ""Digital Copy"" EVER!  This is about the studios giving the consumer what the studios ""deign"" give the consumer.......  NOT what the consumer wants and is ready to pay for - hence we have piracy.....

I had this same issue w/ the final Harry Potter movie - I purchased on Amazon UK which had a region-free disc and an iTunes ""Digital Copy""....... now I can't find the region-free disc on Amazon UK for this movie......!  AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!

I will NEVER purchase an ULTRAVIOLET ""Digital Copy"" because that is NOT the format I want it in.........  Sorry guys.......  Apple has stolen another step on you and anyone with a very small brain can just rip your precious ""content"" for free.......

THIS is what the studios get when they force a format on consumers that they hate - more piracy.........

Though he's hated by Lauren's father's (Nirut Sirijanya), Stu is adored by her brother Teddy (Mason Lee), so he includes him in their partying plans in Bangkok (much to Alan's chagrin.)  Well, once again the boys party to hard, and once again they lose another member of the party (though it's not Doug this time, as he spends most of the movie hanging out at the resort being the boring married guy.)  The difference is that Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) is now responsible for some of the trouble the boys are involved in and a chain-smoking monkey has engaged them on their travels.  The group goes through a bunch of ridiculous scenarios in an attempt to retrace their steps and to explain what occurred the night before and to find their missing comrade.  Will they get back to the wedding unscathed and intact?  Will Stu earn the respect of Lauren's father?  Will Alan ever grow up or will he always be a man-child?

While the first Hangover was laugh-out-loud funny, this one wasn't nearly as humorous.  However, the action sequences were far more intense than what you saw in the first film, so if you were watching this as you were any type of action movie, then it could have been very enjoyable.  However, the ending of the film killed any redeeming factor that the movie leading up to it would have offered.  When Stu told off his previous fiancee, it was one of the moments where everyone in the theater stood up and cheered him on.  Now when he stands up to Lauren's father at the end, the nonsense that comes out of his mouth (and the father's subsequent reaction) is actually less believable than everything else that occurred leading up to it (and believe me, their misadventures in this film were certainly more ridiculous than the first film.)  Part of a movie is wanting to see it again, not to kill 90 minutes of buildup with a weak climax during the last 10 minutes of the film.  I think I read somewhere that Todd Richards is going to hold off on a Hangover 3 movie and frankly, that's probably a solid plan if they want to inject the franchise with some fresh ideas.

It's basically the same plot recycled all over again but instead of taking Place in Las Vegas which really gives you the sense of a Bachelor's Party gone bad this one takes place in Bangkok, Thailand. The same characters are attending a wedding and the same guy goes missing ....Oh that sounds familiar ! It's the same story all over again except less funny. Yes, movies like the Hangover will never win an Oscar but that's not why they are made ! They are for pure entertainment they're supposed to be dumb and funny.

As for the setting, I usually have this unexplained fascination with places I've never visited before and I've visited both Las Vegas and Bangkok and still loved the first movie. However, Bangkok as the whereabouts for Hangover II isn't exactly the best place suitable. No offense it's a beautiful country but it's not right.

4354000,1,B004EPZ06Q,"This is certainly the case of Hollywood trying to cash in and try to create a cashcow franchise. But instead of being a refreshing comedy it is a disappointment of epic proportions. The first Hangover film was a brilliant comedy that was fresh, funny and creative. This sequel in comparison was a severe disappointment. The jokes were clich and offensive in some cases (and not in a good way); the story predictable and recycled; and the writing was weak and uninteresting; and the acting was unbelievable. The only envelope that was pushed in this film was the director's ability to try to put more raunchy scenes in the film than the first film.

As such with many summer blockbusters, the limited amounts of creativity and humor were padded in the trailers, to the point when you watch the movie the jokes are no longer funny. Homophobic, racist, sterotypical/cliche jokes that made up the rest of the comedy not seen in the trailers just don't cut it.

Zach Galifianakis character, Alan, was over the top funny in the first film, in this one he just seems to be trying too hard to be awkwardly funny. Outrageous in the first movie was replaced with over acting in this sequel.

Ed Helms character, Stu, is less interesting than the first film and more whiny than ever. His character isn't enduring he's just annoying.

Justin Bartha's character, Doug, is not much more than an extended cameo in this film much like the first film. But as an audience member, you wonder why he's even in the film at all, other than continuity. It's really not enough for fans of the original.

Ken Jong plays Mr Chow, who was hilarious in the first film and managed to make even mildly racist jokes funny in The Hangover, is merely just perpetuating stereotypical Asian jokes in this film. His character, like Galifianakis's Alan, feels over acted and recycled.

Bradley Cooper's character, Phil, was about the only interesting character of this film, he's charisma was just enough to make me think that the movie was going to get better, but ultimately the film needed more than Cooper's charisma, it needed a script, a director, actors and a miracle.

Supporting cast members Jaime Chung (reality show personality turned actor) - Lauren, and Mason Lee - Teddy, are mere afterthoughts of characters when they should be interesting and part of the storyline even if they aren't in many scenes. Lauren and Stu are slated to get married, but Teddy, Lauren's brother goes missing when the guys go out on a bender for Stu's bachelor party. And other than that premise, you could really care less that Teddy is gone and that Stu is marrying Lauren. Unlike the first film where you really wanted to know what happened to Doug and how and if the guys were going to get him to his wedding on time.

I wish I could give this movie a zero stars but Amazon's lowest rating is a one. If someone were to give me this movie, I'd exchange it for something more valuable, because there's nothing this sequel had to offer other than stealing 102mins of my life away (plus the 15mins it took me to write this reveiw).",1317254400,9,3085,4.668508287292818

Its of course not as funny as the first time you heard the original joke. Well that is the case with the movie ""The Hangover Part II""

Stu, Phil and Allen wake up from a night of partying not long before a friend's wedding. Problem is they cant remember what happened and one of them is missing.

Part II showcases the country beautifully, from the many islands to Bangkok, one of the great cities of the world. They shot a couple scenes at the SkyBar and Scirocco atop State Towers, a location the BBC named one of the worlds best bars.

4354078,2,B004EPZ06Q,"""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". That seems to have been the mentality of director Todd Phillips on set. The sequel for the surprise 2009 smash hit ""The Hangover"" was inevitable. How Phillips would tackle such a sequel, wasn't quite as clear. ""The Hangover Part II"" uses the same formula that brought the first film such success. The EXACT same formula. Here's the opening: It's wedding day, the bride is anxious, and an exasperated, beleaguered Bradley Cooper sputters from his cell phone: ""We did it again"". OOPS! This movie suffers from the ""Sex and the City 2"" conundrum, in which the screenwriters basically say, ""Let's make the same exact movie.... somewhere else"".

Part II takes place in Bangkok, as opposed to Las Vegas. Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married there, and he wants no issues, nothing that could even possibly recreate the horrifying events from the first ""Hangover"". All he wants is a ""bachelor brunch"" at ihop, but is eventually coerced into having just one beer down at the beach with the guys. Cue the timelapse, cut to the morning after, then to the emptying of the pockets, then to the ensuing hijinks. The biggest problem with ""The Hangover Part II"" is its inherent predictability. By following the same cookie-cutter formula, we as the audience aren't shocked by anything, no matter how much they try to raise the stakes (and they try constantly).

Everything is bigger, if not necessarily better, in ""The Hangover Part II"". Someone gets shot at one point, kidnappings and gun shootings are commonplace, drug deals, monkeys, transvestites, riots in the streets. They even have Stu strumming a guitar, singing a song about their absurd misfortunes, much like in the first Hangover! The first Hangover's charm was the insane but legitimate spontaneity of it all. We genuinely cared about what happened, how it happened, and where their friend Doug was. In this one, it's just distracting, and frankly embarrassing watching them go through the motions of the first film in a new city, as Ed Helms tries to contort his facial reactions in new, unique ways.

It probably sounds like I hate this movie, but that's not the case. I found myself laughing throughout, so it's definitely an effective film; the guy next to me certainly thought it was ""way better"" than the first one. ""The Hangover Part II"" will probably be very successful in the box office, but it will have no lasting imprint like the first one. Unfortunately, the project was doomed from the start; by following the same formula, they were setting themselves up for failure. I know I keep harping on the same point, but it's one that defines the whole movie. I truly would have liked to have seen these characters in a different scenario, but not the same scenario somewhere else! That's just absurd!

Then when the film realizes it left out Mike Tyson, even he's lazily thrown in there for the hell of it.

Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are a fun trio to hangout with even if the same material all over again is a waste of their talents.

4354082,2,B004EPZ06Q,"This month, two hotly anticipated sequels were released- Pirates 4 and Hangover 2. For me, this should have been an awesome movie month. Well, OK, Bridesmaids and Thor were awesome movies- however the thing is, these aren't sequels, they're original concepts (OK, well not really original- I'm talking original as in ""The start of something"").

OK, now Pirates wasn't a bad movie, it had its share of entertaining scenes, but felt undercooked for the most part, and sadly, Hangover 2 suffers from exactly the same problem... except Pirates 4 was unfortunately much better.

Now, I LOVED The Hangover. I remeber when it came out back in 2009 and I loved it so much, I saw it twice. Every viewing was just as entertaining as the first. When I heard a Hangover 2 was being made, I was excited. I figured the first movie was good enough to have a solid sequel, and Todd Phillips knew what he was doing was good. So I patiently anticipated this movie, and when it got released, I was one of the first people in line.

Unfortunately, this is no sequel. It is essentially a remake of the first movie. Why is that a problem? Because the first movie was way funnier.

The plot is essentially exatly the same... except this time it's set in Thailand. This time, Stu is getting married to a beautiful Thai woman,
and Allan is not invited- he has even been rendered Catatonic for that reason. Yet after a bit of convincing, Allan is suddenly invited along, and alredy having problems with the chosen best man- Teddy, Stu's wife-to-be's brother. After a rather disconcerting celebratory dinner at the resort, the gang, with teddy, go down to the resort's beach and have a few drinks... and then the first movie happens... again.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you the rest, because I'm assuming you have seen the first movie already, and if you have, you've seen this movie too.

The problem with Hangover 2 is that it's just plain not original AT ALL. While it did have a few belly laughs, in particular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago. Plenty of people I know, my girlfriend and manager at work included, asked ""Why didn't you like it? It's exactly the same as the first."" The latter sentence is exactly why I was disappointed- I felt that with this being a sequel, they could have introduced something new. Sadly this wasn't the case- everything came from the first movie, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to be over. Because I saw it two years ago already, but much funnier. In my opinion, only one movie got away with being a carbon copy of its predecessor- Escape from LA.

That being said, maybe if you haven't seen the first movie, you will love this. But if you have, well, hoo boy, prepare yourself for a mega disappointment. They practically REMADE the first movie, all the way down to Stu singing a song about the crap they're in and then some. If you must see it, rent it on blu-ray- it is not worth the $15.75 UltraAVX price I paid to see it.

4354083,5,B004EPZ06Q,"A good sequel better than the first. The first movie while funny seemed to stop short of pushing the envelope of what could be shown on the screen.  There are no such problems with the sequel.

Todd Phillips reuses the same recipe of hi-jinks and hilarity but pushes it to the next level in The Hangover Part II. This time the laughs and scenarios are a lot more raunchier and bizarre than the first movie.

It's true that setup and certain parts are copied of the original, but to call this a carbon copy of the first would be a misstatement.

The location is different, newer characters are introduced, the characters seem more in tune with themselves than the first movie when they were going through the motions of what was going on. Here they don't seem as shocked by the circumstances surrounding their wild night of debauchery (for example Alan's bald head doesn't seem to phase him, Phil chucking at Stu's Mike Tyson tattoo, and Mr. Chow's sudden friendship with the Wolfpac namely Alan). If anything there seems to be a certain admiring among the guys over what they have done (except for Stu).

They did try to provide a bit more of a back story as well. In the first movie, Stu was a miserable wreck with his relationship, gets married in Vegas (though he has on recollection of what happened) and eventually separates from that girl as well. Here they tried to introduce Stu as happier man when he's about to get married to his Asian bride despite the fact that her father disapproves of their whole union.

The interactions even with some of the objects and animals for example carry in a bit more time and usage. Like the Tiger in the first movie was merely just there as a small side note to the Wolfpac's inebriated rampage over Vegas. In this sequel, the hilarious drug dealing monkey in Bangkok serves a bit more purpose and actually practically steals the movie during a couple of over the top scenes.

Regardless then of whether of you dispute if this is more or the same, the end point of this discussion should be whether this is a great comedy or not. The simple answer to that is DUH yes!!!!!

It has all the elements of a good comedy, it's a good buddy movie, and it never manages to be boring. It delivers the laughs and then some.",1306627200,2,2257,4.50122249388753
4354084,3,B004EPZ06Q,"Full-disclosure: I thought the first Hangover movie was among the best in its class.

I remember comparing it favorably to ""Old School"" and ""American Pie"" when I encouraged friends to see it.

But, let's call a spade a spade.

Part II would have been more aptly named ""Part 2.0"" because it is essentially a re-imagining of the first movie.

Additionally, nothing of note happens until the ""Wolfpack"" gets to Thailand one-third of the way through the film.

With this having been said, there are a few really cool moments -- such as Alan's (Zach Galifanikis) flashback that tells you everything you need to know about how he views the world; a hilarious version of Billy Joel's ""Allentown"" with poignantly-disturbing lyrics provided by Stu (Ed Helm) and some rather shocking disclosures toward the end of the movie involving a bad night in a strip club and a dismembered finger.

This movie would have been a classic if it had been the only ""Hangover"" film ever released. But, it suffers in comparison to its predecessor.

I would compare it to a DJ remixing an already perfect song. It may be interesting to listen to. But, honestly, you'd rather he played the original version and left well-enough alone.

4354085,2,B004EPZ06Q,"Todd Phillip's 2009 comedy film The Hangover, while unoriginal in the sense of a buddy comedy gone wrong, did have its moments in the spotlight. The idea behind the film was simple, formulaic at times, yet was very good at providing a good pace for our 3 amnesiac heroes as they blindly stumble from one crazy incident to the other. I didn't get the sense that it dragged at all there was always something going and really seemed  to feel as though the writers had found somewhat of an even flow. Even when it seemed to drag it always found some outrageous allusion to popular culture such as Mike Tyson, Rain Man or other moments that the 3 leads could work with especially the character of Alan ( Galifanakis). However this was not the case with the 2011 follow-up entitled The Hangover Part II. The title just with the incorporation of the roman numerals seems to suggest a tongue-in-cheek prestige, with the promise that it could live up and dominate the first in situation comedy.
  Right from the get go I felt like the actors were sort of going through the motions and more ad-libbing moments to creative ""authentic"" comedy rather then follow any sort of script. It struck me as though Phillip's had no clue as to how to live up to the hype that would sure to be created with the announcement of a sequel and thus half-assed the script. The plot to me didn't feel believable at all in terms of following up the first film with Stu and the gang heading for his Thai wedding. To me what appealed to me about the ending of the first one was the seemingly romantic relationship with Heather Graham's character and the baby Carlos which was pretty darn funny at points. However, much to my chagrin this was not taken advantage of most likely to avoid repeating shooting in Vegas which as all of us known had been done before. Characters such as Mr. Chow who makes his grand re appearance in the second does not have the same presence that he did in the first in terms of laugh out loud moments. For the first half of the movie it felt strained and I found myself yawning on many an occasion as I felt as though I had seen this all before word for word. Certainly this movie at least for the majority of the film follows the same situations that the first did with very slight twists on the ideas. For the example the tiger is now a cigarette smoking monkey, the missing tooth is now a tyson-esque tattoo, the ""misplaced buddy"" is now a misplaced future brother in law etc. While in theory these  ideas should work as they did fine in the Vegas strip they unfortunately do not. Bangkok while alive in culture did not provide the same wild backdrop that first did almost becoming more of a sheet on a tack for a puppet show then an real comedic element/prop that the actors could work with. When the film does drag ( and does frequently) it tries to distract us with various displays of lewd, gross-out humor, that seem almost unnecessary like when someone talks really loudly when they fart so you don't hear it. Unlike the first film it felt long to me, I started marking the plot points in the film like bulletpoints on a list. We get one or two unexpected cameos to reward us for our patience but really nothing left me ultimately satisfied by the end of 102 minutes.
  When the film does eventually end it is a relief as by the 75 min mark I had already seen all that I needed to be satisfied. Literally the film ends exactly the way the first one did almost word for word and quite ridiculously. In the end what could've been a decent follow up ending up being a waste of a film which to me felt like a much better films ugly rude cousin. While the jokes do break through on rare occasions, The Hangover 2 is definitely one worth skipping unless you're a die-hard fan of the original.

And this movie is not going to help their cause because it is clear that not all of the orcs were even played by orcs.
My wife is the head of diversity and inclusion at a major international company.  She was so disappointed in the portrayal of orcs by humans that she intends to write a formal complaint to the studio.  I won't go that far because I know that the studio probably struggled with finding orcs that are actors.  It is just not a common field for them to pursue.  When they are young they are culturally driven to pursue more physical jobs.  I don't blame the producers or the director, but I think they should have simply used fewer orcs in each shot so that the real orcs could have played every orc role in the movie.  I truly believe that they may have done that in the final battle scenes when the dynamite arrows hurt or killed small bands of orcs.  I hope to turn on the Academy Awards this year and see some orcs at least nominated for one or two Oscars.  Their deaths were very well done.",1529020800,,1686,4.37620578778135

8427441,2,B004EPZ06Q,"Very uneven. There were times when the lines and acting were good, then they would take a sharp turn for the worse in the next scene. I think there were larger than average chunks of time in between shoots. Even the orc makeup varied from beginning, middle, and end. It wasn't the worst thing I've seen, but far from the best.",1526860800,,326,4.360655737704918
8427442,4,B004EPZ06Q,"I went in to watch this with low expectations, but it is actually entertaining. I love low budget horror/sci-fi and this fit like a glove. Subpar acting, and sometimes archetypal characters but it is worth the 90 minutes I gave it. Was entertained. Especially enjoyed the LOTR ties in the fairways scenes. Over All a good movie as long as your not looking to watch the next blockbuster.",1526688000,,386,4.6911764705882355
