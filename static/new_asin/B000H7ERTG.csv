8137471,2,B000H7ERTG,"I'm rating this version 2 stars, instead of 4 because the print is in black and white although the movie was filmed in color and is available that way on DVD.  It's a good movie, not great, but good.  The film is based on a play and is very much a showcase for Anna Neagle who gets to play 2 different characters (mother and daughter), but also as well as to reprise scenes from two of her biggest hit movies playing Nell Gwyn and Queen Victoria in dream sequences.  For the Flynn fans, you will find a different Flynn than you are used to, he is a song and dance man here and functions as Anna Neagle's leading man rather than the real star of this picture.  David Farrar is also featured and gives a pleasant performance as well. If you are not a fan of Ms. Neagle's, you will not care much for this film.  If you are, you will enjoy it but I would strongly recommend you seek out the color versions available rather than this.",1303689600,,929,4.196629213483146
