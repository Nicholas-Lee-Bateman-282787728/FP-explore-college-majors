8426536,5,B004E5G7FE,"For those who don't know, this is another Wal-Mart exclusive double pack from WWE with the concept behind this being to re-release an old anthology set combined with the 2009 edition of the PPV based upon the same match concept.  In this case, it's the Ladder Match match.

T.L.C. - Tables, Ladders, And Chairs 2009:
Ladder Match: ECW Champion Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin - With the ECW brand being lost in the shuffle for the past couple of PPV's (which Christian openly admitted weeks earlier), they came back with a bang here with the two men who have their own highlight reels when it comes to ladder matches. Michael Cole described this match just right in the end when he called it a ""thriller"" because you just had so many moments such as various moves done off the ladder (flying clothesline, powerslam, scorpion deathdrop) and done onto the ladder (frog splash) and one moment where Shelton showed heavy strength by catching Christian off the ladder into a powerbomb onto another one. The only thing I can really say that was negative here was when Christian got busted open at one point & the match was stopped so the EMT can attend to it leading the crowd to chant ""WE WANT BLOOD."" Despite that one negative, they did what they acomplished to do & that's steal the show.

Intercontinental Champion John Morrison vs. Drew McIntyre - This was a different type of match than the previous match as this was more of a normal wrestling match with Drew using a more mat-based offense as opposed to how Morrison uses a more diverse combination style. It was hard to follow up the previous match as the crowd was mostly dead for this match as it started off real show but picked up the pace overtime as these two young guys put together a good above average contest.

Womens Champion Michelle McCool vs. Mickie James - Before I get started, someone tell Michelle to leave ""boxer"" attire with the rest of Marc Mero's leftovers? Just based off the buildup they had for weeks with all the ""Piggy James"" comments, this match played out exactly how it should have in the beginning as it was real intense to the point where the opening moments had a tie-up the went all the way out of the ring with both heavily starting each other down. However from there, they didn't keep it going throughout the match as it was just a good average divas contest with Layla coming into play on the outside. Instead of this coming off as a relevant match on the card with all the buildup it had, it just came off mostly as a filler but it was one of Mickie's better matches this year compared to the others where she just seemed to keep having an off night.

Tables Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Sheamus - Unless you've been heavily paying attention to ECW & RAW for the past few months, your going to say ""Who The Hell Is Sheamus?"" Well, he's a new face in the heavyweight division known as the ""Celtic Warrior"" (complete with his own press in Irish newspapers) & was put in the right position for his first major PPV match against Cena in a tables match as it's been proven that Cena's best performances are in these types of ""No Rules"" matches. They had a good brawl that had the usual moments you would expect but one key thing to pay attention to in this match is the commentary because even though people didn't like the ending, it was referenced early in the match and it was a good way to keep both men strong afterwards.

Chairs Match: World Champion Undertaker vs. Batista - Please someone correct me if I wrong but this is the first time I've ever heard of a ""chairs match"" but this is just a normal match with the stipulation that chairs were legal to use & that point was hammered home in the opening moments as Batista went for the chairs right away. Even though chairs were legal, they didn't heavily base the match around that but I'll say that this match was a step down from their previous series of matches back in 2007-2008 as it just seemed like they didn't pick up the pace at all during the match and the ending was really just out of left field. Good match but it didn't match the standards set by their previous matches as this was missing that ""it"" factor for me.

Kofi Kingston vs. Randy Orton - After months of having the ""rinse, wash, repeat"" formula of having Kofi defend his title in multi-man matches before finally dropping the Jamaican character & getting more serious, this was Kofi's ""breakout"" match here as he was more aggressive than we've seen before with using high impact moves at various times before Orton hit a dropkick on Kofi's ribs in midair after Kofi jumped off the top rope onto the outside. Orton continued his ""Viper"" character by heavily focusing on his ribs while Kofi kept fighting back. Very competitive match between both men in a type of match that had both men leaving strong with great selling by Kofi throughout the match on both his ribs & his arm after blocking Orton's punt.

T.L.C. Match: Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs. D-Generation X - DX was out to gain their first set of tag team championship (even though technically the New Age Outlaws were tag team champions as members of DX a decade ago). This started out as you would expect with an all-out brawl on the from the ring to the floor all the way to the arm with dueling chair being used. This match had it's various moments with Big Show actually being the M.V.P. of the match like how Triple H was sprawled across a ladder in the corner only for HBK to the thrown against him & be squished by Show, Big Show punched through a chair into Triple H's face, the power of Show destroying more than one ladder with his bare hands, and the comedic ending with Jericho & Show working together to grab the belts only for that to backfire in a nasty way for Jericho as he took the worst fall than anyone else the entire night. If your expecting the heavy ""spotfest"" that you've gotten from T.L.C./Ladder matches in the past that you won't get it here but this was still a good contest with plenty of moments to not leave you disappointed.

The Ladder Match Anthology:
It's amazing how a simple concept for a match (climb up a ladder & grab the belt) has spawn so many memorable moments in the history of professional wrestling and WWE picked out a wonderful collection of matches here to illustrate how the ladder match has spawn off so many memorable to classic moments in wrestling & was also the catalyst for so many versions of this match including T.L.C., Stairway To Hell in ECW, and King Of The Mountain in TNA.

North American Champion Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (Junkyard Dog) - This was joined in progress and it was using a one sided ladder with the referees holding it steady while the wrestlers climbed up. Nothing special past the historical factor.
Stampede Wrestling '79

Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Even though many remember WrestleMania X to be the first Ladder Match, this was truly the first one. For this match being the first of it's kind in WWE at the time, it's really something to see with how the ladder was used at times along with the ""X"" factor of Sherri getting involved at times.
July '92

Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon - I'm glad they put this one on here instead of their WrestleMania X one since most people forgot about it. This match was completely different than their previous on in that they didn't use the ladder as a weapon while both men knew each other so well that they were able to avoid each others signature moves throughout the match. This one won't disappoint and if you want an idea of how comical WWF was back in '95, watch the HBK intro when they have a guy trying to sell you his merchandise at ringside (ala Home Shopping Network).
SummerSlam '95

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Triple H - Even though Undertaker/Austin was the main event, this was the match that stole the show. HHH was selling a knee injury that he got earlier in the night while the Rock was just ruthless here with both Chyna & Mark Henry getting involved here. This was the highlight match of both men's career before they would go on to each win the World Title.
SummerSlam '98

Edge & Christian vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) - This was the match that put both teams on the map that would eventually plant the seeds for the future series of ladder/T.L.C. matches featuring various members. Since this was the first tag team ladder match, it was non-stop action & never a dull moment.
No Mercy '99

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - The first T.L.C. match and this was the one that topped their WrestleMania match months earlier. Again, this is one of those matches that I can't describe in words that you just have to watch.
SummerSlam '00

Shannon Moore & Shane Helms vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing. This match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time. It wasn't as crazy as the T.L.C. matches in WWE but these guys put on one hell of a performance.
WCW Starrcade '00

Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - They took from brutal bumps & the chair shot delivered when Benoit went though the ropes was ""hardcore"" to say the least & is a classic in quality.
Royal Rumble '01

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - T.L.C. II followed the same patterns as their previous matches with the exception this time being the involvement of Lita, Rhyno, and Spike Dudley. This match has the highlight reel of Edge (off the top of the ladder) spearing Jeff Hardy (who was hanging from the belt hooks) all the way to the floor that WWE still uses in some promotional videos today.
WrestleMania X-7

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - This match is known as the ""forgotten T.L.C."" for various reasons such as Edge not acknowledging this match when he kept saying ""I never lost a T.L.C. match."" Jericho & Benoit pulled off some spots not seen in the previous ones such as a headbutt off the top of a ladder though a table that led to his eventual neck surgery.
""SmackDown"" May '01

Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Edge - With both men having so much experience in a ladder match with each other, this match certainly had it's moments when they went against each other. The ladder here was used as a weapon various times along with making a regular move more impactful. This had it's various moments like Christian getting crotched & later being snapped off the top rope onto the ladder, both falling off the ladder onto the floor, and Edge getting his receipts on all the acts Christian did to him over the past two months.
No Mercy '01

Intercontinental Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam - This match had a style of both of them using the ladder to make their normal moves more high impactful with Eddie heavily dominating while constantly targeting RVD's face. These was very intense and was without a doubt one of the best matches on WWE TV for that year.
""RAW"" May '02
(Eddie Guerrero: Cheating Death, Stealing Life)

WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - The story behind this match was Undertaker just delivering a beating to Jeff Hardy who just refused to quit & give up...to the point where Taker just had to do what he had to do after the match.
""RAW"" July '02

T.L.C. Match: World Tag Team Champion Kane vs. Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian - They advertise Hurricane for this match but he wasn't in it. High spots all over the place along with high impact moves to the point to where Bubba Ray suffered such a concussion that he doesn't remember the match to this day.
""RAW"" Oct. '02

Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury. This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.
Unforgiven '04

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin Kane vs. Edge vs. Christian - I was here LIVE & to quote Joey Styles ""OH MY GOD!"" The show-stealer here though was Shelton Benjamin as he looked like Spiderman with the majority of the moves he was pulling off involving the ladders. As a side note, watch Kane's intro because that was something to see with the ladders on fire.
WrestleMania 21

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - It was a great ladder match even though the storyline got stupid with the whole ""Dominic is my son"" thing going on (well, it did result in the ""I'm Your Papi"" shirt so I guess it's not all bad). Lots of interference from Vicki Guerrero & Dominic himself but it didn't ruin the match itself.
SummerSlam '05

Loser Leaves RAW Match: Matt Hardy vs. Edge - The final encounter between these two in this very personal feud against each other and as you expected, this was a fight with weapons like a table also getting involved here while Lita played a big role in this match from beginning to end. This doesn't live up to the previous ladder matches these two have had but it was still good.
""RAW"" Oct. '05

T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion Edge vs. Ric Flair - At this stage in Flair's career, this was a completely new environment for him as this was his very first ladder match with his daughter at ringside. This match was more about ""how can Flair take this punishment as his age"" than anything else as Edge targeted Flair's head after he suffered the concussion the week before resulting in his entire face being the classic ""crimson mask"". Flair gave out the much punishment here as well as he received it & this was a very impressive performance from Ric Flair in this being his first time doing this type of match.
""RAW"" Jan. '06

WWE Champion Edge vs. John Cena - Cena was of course booed out the building due to the fact they were in Edge's hometown but that's when Cena is at his best (remember One Night Stand). Again, both men brought their A game & resulted in a great main event with plenty of highlight moments including the final ""F-U"" to Edge towards the end.
Unforgiven '06

Intercontinental Champion Johnny Nitro vs. Jeff Hardy - This was the match for me that put Nitro on the map as a ""superstar of the future"" as he was able to hold his own & surpass the previous RAW ladder matches with the ladder match veteran in Jeff Hardy. This was just another match in their great series of matches but look out for the swanton on the ladder by Jeff Hardy.
""RAW"" Nov. '06

WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. MNM vs. The Hardys - We all know what the Hardys & MNM can do based on their past so mix that with the daredevil style London & Kendrick adapted along with the fact that Regal & Taylor didn't look out of place with their mat wrestling style as well. And watch out for that SICK spot where Joey Mercury's face gets crushed.
Armageddon '06

In the end, the T.L.C. PPV was my favorite themed PPV of the year as it wasn't a classic but come off like everyone stepped their game up & had a good mix of in-ring action (wrestling & hardcore) along with establishing new stars in the process.  As for the anthology, WWE didn't drop the ball & picked out a bunch of matches available on multiple DVD sets so you know you'll be getting more than your money's worth & they do acknowledge the history of ladder matches before WrestleMania X (which they've said was the first ladder match). The only ladder match I've seen that I wish was on here was the Judgment Day 2003 match between Hass & Benjamin vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri but you can't win them all.  I highly recommend this.",1294272000,,16255,4.495257452574526
