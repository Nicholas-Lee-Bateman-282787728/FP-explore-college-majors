The busty blond girl, the one squeezed into the little desk in his classroom, the one with the distinctive mole on her cheek... was apparently doing porn in LA back then. If you can find it, you can see her deep throating Ron Jeremy by a swimming pool. She was quite talented. Don't ask me how I know this.",1496880000,,327,4.290322580645161
7876744,5,630476359X,Great movie.  Too bad never made a sequel.,1474156800,,42,4.25
7876745,5,630476359X,"I practically cried all the way through it. It seem to be an emotional roller coaster for me! I hope they bring it to dvd soon not for any extras, cause I'm pretty sure they will not be able to come up with any...But this is the kind of movie I would want to be around for future generations!",1076716800,,292,3.9661016949152543
7876746,5,630476359X,"Before ""Falling Down,"" there was ""Cole Justice.""  The idea of a good man seeking justice in a world where there seems to be none always makes for a good story.  This movie really needs to be released on DVD. What a shame it didn't have the financial backing and resources of the typical Hollywood media-blitz. People who haven't seen ""Cole Justice"" are missing a really good movie.",1054857600,3,381,4.6716417910447765

7876748,5,630476359X,"I know that this is not a well know film, but it is a diamond in the ruff..
 This movie is a hero type of film that really gives you a good feeling, and includes lots of really fun action.
 You will want to be a modern day cowboy after seeing this film!",1045785600,2,253,3.7547169811320753
7876749,3,630476359X,"For the time and money we didn't have, I was very pleased with the finished film. Yes, this type of movie has been time an time again, but I think we gave it a different spin. There are no new ideas, you just try to do them better than the last guy. I think we were successful. I think it is a good story which is about a history professor who acts out his western gun-fighter fantasy in today's world. Or... simple justice done with a modern day western twist. It was my pleasure to write, direct, and play, Cole Justice. I would consider it to be PG-13. Enjoy it. We did making it.",1014249600,8,583,4.12280701754386
