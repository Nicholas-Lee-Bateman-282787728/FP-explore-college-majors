  Shortly after the very last episode ""Lucy Meets the Mustache"", with Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams, was filmed, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz.
  Lucy came back to CBS with a new tv series, The Lucy Show (1962-68). Vivian Vance also returned to help her friend Lucy with the new show. She stayed for 3 seasons. William Frawley made a guest appearance in Season 4.
  Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball never appeared on a tv series together again, but Desi was on the set as ""executive producer"".
  During the course of the show you will notice some changes made. This is called a ""re-tool"". The children disappeared and the house changed, now in color.
  Guess I will have to buy all of the Lucy Show tv series to find out what happened.

The tv prints are not restored, but have that old syndicated look. However, I enjoyed all 10 episodes in this set.

 I received this Lucy Show DVD set from my daughter and didn't have the heart to tell her I had already bought ""The Lucy Show: The Official First Season"" for myself. However, this volume contains episodes I have not seen yet.
 I was in the womb or had already been born during these episodes in this set. So I do appreciate my daughter's gift and will keep it in my collections at home.
  The Lucy Show began October 1, 1962, so I wonder if I was conceived during the Lucy Show.

 Funny line from Gale Gordon, ""...more fun than banking?""

 You will see Carol Burnett in her first and second appearance working with Lucille Ball. She adored Lucy so much.
  The next year, Carol would begin her own variety show on CBS, The Carol Burnett Show.  Incidentally, Lucy had passed away on Carol's birthday on April 26, 1989 at the age of 77.

 Dick Martin would leave The Lucy Show to team up with Dan Rowan on NBC for Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968-73).

  After The Lucy Show ended in 1968, Lucy restyled the show again and named it, ""Here's Lucy"". She brought back Gale Gordon as her boss again. Vivian Vance would visit once in a while. Lucy added her real-life children to the cast Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.
