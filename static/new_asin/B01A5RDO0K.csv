8746528,5,B01A5RDO0K,This video explains a lot of subtle things about tsukamaki as well as handle making selection of samegawa as well as the proper way to place the ito with the weave facing the proper way. It has a lot more info compared to Thomas buck's art of tsukamaki when it comes to the subtle details that make a great tsuka wrap. Bucks book is great too. Glad I have both worth every penny,1517875200,,378,4.191780821917808
