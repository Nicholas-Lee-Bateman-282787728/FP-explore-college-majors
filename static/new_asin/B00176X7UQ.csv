8265202,5,B00176X7UQ,"This has to be one of the most action packed Bruce Le films that he's made. The plot revolves around a missing treasure that his Sifu requests he recover and gives him half a silver coin. Shot entirely in the Philippines, the only familiar face was Cheung Nik in a support role. The rest of the cast was graced by mostly Filipino actors; including the lead villain played by a young voluptuous woman who knows kung fu and is apparently the leader of a mafia like gang determined to prevent Bruce's character from getting to the treasure.

At one point Bruce is ambushed by a gang of primitive looking midgets that wear only a loin cloth and use various weapons to no avail. One of the best scenes was the gang leader meeting Bruce by coincidence on a beach trying to seduce him to which Bruce politely declines. To coerce him she fakes a drowning to which our hero obligates himself to come to her aid. Then suddenly no less than 5 knife wielding busty babes rise out of the water in yet another surprise ambush. And of course, there's the fight scene with the shaolin bronzemen in a public park in Manila.

There are plenty of fight filled sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the climactic end.",1406419200,3,1218,4.408888888888889
