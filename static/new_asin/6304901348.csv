8195347,5,6304901348,"Alright all, Type O Negative is MY band.  Everything that they put out is phenomenal and you all know it! So this video is even more phenomenal for its glimpse behind the scenes.  Translation, ""Buy it!""  Yes, knucklehead, this means you!  -----If you leave now without buying it I will hop on my broom-vac, track you down and dye your kitty green and black...consider yourself warned.",994809600,3,384,4.7727272727272725
8195348,5,6304901348,"Type O Negative has combined sly interviews and lush music videos, allowing their fans to come even closer to the band. With tongues planted firmly in cheek, they deliver the goods! Well done, and a must for any fan  of gothadelic!",961977600,,231,4.634146341463414
8195349,3,6304901348,"As a Type O Negative fanatic for the past eight years I was really excited to see this video when I bought it. While the video has both ups and downs, it is quite mediocre. You get to see the band members' true colors behind  the music they play, i.e., Peter's idea of a dream home, Kenny's baby  daughter, Josh's priorities, and Johnny's view on life. The live footage is  a bit lacking, simply cutting scenes on and off now and again, mainly  scenes where they parties up on stage with Pantera. The interviews aren't  quite as bad, at least including whole sentence answers. However, there  wasn't enough of any one interview to get the point of each one. There are  quite of few humorous interviews with people who both like and disliked the  band, some just being bitter.
  If you are looking for music videos,  this tape has them. The only problem is, the videos are not really  Oscar-worthy performances. The ""Christian Woman: Naildriver  Version"" video is actually quite breath taking, and each video has a  lot of potential, but none of them really live it out. ""Black  No. 1"" has a is a black & white semi-gothic vampiric setting of an  undead fun-fest. The video would have been better suited to Oingo Boingo's  ""Dead Man's Party"". ""Christian Woman <edited>"" is  okay, with sexual images and what appears to be superimposed crosses all  over the screen goes for a chilling setting, but doesn't look as impressive  as it could. ""My Girlfriend's Girlfriend"" has a 60s/70s  psychedelic atmosphere with vague cut scenes of Peter bedding to women at  once, and other scenes of the girls driving around in a corvette. It's a  decent video that' all around fun but nothing to shout about. ""Love  You to Death"" is a good bright atmosphered video of romance and  tragedy mixed together for a very pretty but somewhat depressing video.  ""Christian Woman: Naildriver Version"" is, like I said, actually a  breath taking video full of in your face religious imagery. If you're  familiar with literary devices it will smack you in the face several times,  both lyrically and visually.
  Before people bash the videos too much,  they need to understand that Roadrunner Records does not provide a very  generous budget for their videos, or for promotion advertisement for that  matter, as Type O fans might have noticed. But they still could have been  better.
  All in all, this is a fair video that Type O fans will  definitly want to look at, newcomers should start off their collection with  the CDs ""Bloody Kisses"" or ""October Rust"" first before  they decide whether or not they want the video.
  In the future,  depending on when you read this review, the DVD version of ""After  Dark"" will be available. It will feature the video for  ""Everything Dies"", the first single off their most recent studio  album, ""World Coming Down"".
  The video is decent, but nothing  special. Hardcore fans should run out and get it, everyone else might want  to learn more about Type O Negative's music first.",961891200,5,2991,4.7573385518591
8195350,3,6304901348,"I would have to agree with the first reviewer that Type O Negative's videos are not groundbreaking pieces of art.  The quality of the videos leaves a lot to be desired. The cheesy photo shop lens flares in  ""Everything Dies"" and  the awful looking superimposed crosses in  ""Christian Woman"" makes it look like the videos were made by  first year film students. Nothing in Type O Negative's videos are earth  shattering or revolutionary (nothing like the creative masterpieces by  Trent Reznor),but then again, Type O does a decent job considering the low  budget that was allocated to them by Roadrunner.  The interviews and live  footage are fairly well done, with the band displaying their trademark  ""tounge in cheek"" humor.  However, once you've watched After Dark  once, there is little motivation to go back and watch it again.  If you're  a hardcore type o negative fan, you should check it out (It is Type O after  all!), otherwise you will be wasting your money.",955756800,,971,4.865030674846626
8195351,5,6304901348,"After Dark is a real must have for every Type O Negative Fan. Not because of the interview and (rare) live-footage (that's okay too, but it's not what the video is really all about) but because of the video-clips  themselves. How many times do you get to see a Type O video on MTV? See!  Here you can watch them over and over again. And, furthermore, they're NOT  conventional rock and roll videos. ""Christian Woman"" and  ""Black No 1"" marked Type O's status as would be vampires and  ""Love U to death"" really could be taken right out of a Nathaniel  Hawthorne novel like ""Young Goodman Brown"". This video really  shows the (possible) puritan roots of their music and how they mock  them...""My girlfriend's girlfriend"" looks just as if you took the  psychodelic music of The Doors and visualized it: it's a very unusual  colorful Pop-video, showing Pete Steele in full action, i. e. with two  girls... To put it in a nutshell: if you were longing to see Type O videos  this is just the thing.",954979200,,991,4.536723163841808
8195352,4,6304901348,"After Dark is a collection of Type O Negative's video's, as well as some brief behind the scene's interviews and live clips.  The video's themselves are fairly conventional rock videos, that don't take many chances or offer  anything of real artistic merit.  The real jems of the video are the  interviews with the band members.  We see the bands trademark dark  sarcastic humor in full force (especially with the segments with Peter  Steele and Josh Silver).  This video is really more like a ""TV  special"" than a full fledged documentary and/or band info video.  We  get teased with brief live clips and backstage footage, that are spread  between the six videos.  It would be nice to see RoadRunner put out a real  documentary/live video of this highly creative and talented band, rather  than a sixty minute montage of clips and videos.  Serious Type O Negative  fans will want to get this tape to add to their collection, but I doubt  this video has enough appeal to attract anyone else.
Pro's:  Interviews, and Live clips Con's: Mediocre Videos, needs more live stuff!  Bottom Line:  Good, But Type O Negative needs to put out a ""real""  video/documentary",952732800,,1160,4.841025641025641
