5735042,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Great Standup Routine by Craig Ferguson

I ordered it the First day it was available and had a viewing party for it that next weekend.

Well worth the 10 bucks he's asking for it.

This is an hour plus of STAND UP, it's NOT just another TV Show",1377302400,,244,4.041666666666667
5735043,5,B00CQRNLLU,"I don't think I have ever seen or heard Craig Ferguson when I didn't laugh my *** off.  I enjoyed this performance so much I have watched it 3 times so far.  I have also read all his books and learned so much about the life behind the humor, and I respect him so much for being so open and honest about his life, where he started and how he got to where he is today.  I think anyone with an open mind, over the age of 25-30, and has lived a bit outside the box will appreciate all of his performances and laugh their *** off as well!",1376524800,,533,3.871559633027523
5735044,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Craig Ferguson is so funny when he does his standup routines. I couldn't wait to watch it. My son and I laughed so hard. It was nice to share the experience.
I simply love Craig Ferguson.  This was just another gem for my video library.",1376006400,2,236,4.2444444444444445
5735045,4,B00CQRNLLU,"If you like Craig Ferguson's comedy on his late late night show, you will love this. Except no bleeped obscenities, so you actually get to hear how a Scot pronounces some of that stuff. Riffs on babies, Hollywood... and no bad Kardashian jokes, thank heavens. Not to mention a Sean Connery bit that had me in tears, it was so funny. I give it less than five stars only because I found a couple of spots to be a bit dead.",1375574400,6,420,4.197530864197531
5735046,5,B00CQRNLLU,"The DVD isn't released yet, but I have seen this on the internet streaming service it was already released on. It is so funny... I was laughing to the point of crying the whole show. And I'd already seen it when he preformed the same show live before. It is honestly, just like all Craig Ferguson's other stand up specials, absolutely hilarious and worth every penny.",1371772800,18,367,4.575757575757576
5735047,5,B00CQRNLLU,I was at that show and laughed so hard tears were running down my face and my face hurt afterward from the constant laughing! There's no one funnier,1369612800,18,148,4.321428571428571

5735051,3,B00CQRNLLU,This production lacked a lot of the fun found in Craig's earlier videos. Amusing but with an angry edge.,1423094400,2,104,4.526315789473684

5735060,5,B00CQRNLLU,"We love ""Craigy Ferg"" and this performance did not dissappoint.  We'll be missing him after December.  He truly does have a talk show that is unlike any other talk show.  It stands to reason his stand-up would be hilarious.",1400112000,,223,4.666666666666667
5735061,5,B00CQRNLLU,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my mom.  She loved it. If you are a fan of his TV show, you'll love it.",1400025600,,115,3.6
5735062,5,B00CQRNLLU,"This guy is so funny.  All of his CDs are great and his book, ""American on Purpose"" is terrific.  He's an American citizen, Irish descent from Scotland.  So, of course, he's funny.",1399420800,,180,4.5625
5735063,5,B00CQRNLLU,"This was an amazingly funny video. I could not stop laughing. If you are feeling down, this video is the cure. I wish Craig would have more stand up videos. I Also hope that he put out a compilation of the best from his Late Late show gig",1399248000,,238,3.9791666666666665

If you need a good, sarcastic laugh, try this one.",1392076800,,121,4.304347826086956
5735070,5,B00CQRNLLU,i stay up late and i started watching the late late show with Craig Ferguson by accident. I then read the two books he has written and when i heard he had a grammy nomination for this recording i had to get it. His humor may not be for everyone but i certainly enjoy his intellegence,1389571200,2,283,4.071428571428571
5735071,5,B00CQRNLLU,I was in the audience at this show and bought this to share with brother.  Still LMAO.  This guy is one of the most inventive comics working.,1388966400,,141,4.185185185185185
5735072,3,B00CQRNLLU,"you've watched his TV show then you've pretty much seen this stuff.  The only thing missing is the ""Ai Carramba!!"", the Robot Skeleton & the 2 man Horse (and the guest stars). If you don't watch the show, then its fine.  On second thought, just watch the TV show........",1387756800,,270,4.489795918367347
5735073,5,B00CQRNLLU,"I love everything he does and just when you think he can't get even funnier, he does it!  There is language but nothing more than your kids hear on rap records!  LOL",1385251200,,165,4.125
5735074,5,B00CQRNLLU,OMG! This guy is soooo funny! I watch his tv show when I am up that late (not usually) and he has a sharp and quick wit. Absolutely loved the DVD!,1384473600,,146,3.7419354838709675
5735075,5,B00CQRNLLU,Truly enjoy Mr. Ferguson's brand of humor and think he is the best late night entertainer on TV.  People like Jimmy Kimmel & Jimmy Fallon can't even come close to this man's genius.,1384128000,2,181,4.484848484848484
5735076,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Yes it is indeed a great day for America with this latest release from TV's Craig Ferguson. Ferguson's live show is something of an extension of his monologue on The Late Late Show, but without any pixelated swear words. Live and in person Craigy Ferg is completely unleashed, sharing his thoughts and observations with us. I've seen him live twice, and this DVD nicely captures the live Ferguson experience. Classically stream of consciousness and subtly intellectual, Craigy Ferg's standup act is amazing. On this DVD he runs the table on topics, including of course his battles with addiction (the raw edge and complete authenticity here is, as always, amazing), Hitler, shark penises, and the ""celebrity culture"" he experiences first-hand in Los Angeles. If you like Craig Ferguson's TV show but always find yourself wanting more, this is the DVD for you.",1383264000,17,859,5.099290780141844
5735077,4,B00CQRNLLU,I like Craig Ferguson he is funny comedian and talks about different topics that are really funny. Some comedians have a list of topics to talk about but he doesn't use a list. Goes from one topic to the other.,1382832000,,210,4.275
5735078,4,B00CQRNLLU,"We love Craig, and this special is very funny. But we're learning that we find Craig to be much funnier on his own show. We love seeing him push back against the censors and suits. That's when Craig is at his funniest. But this special was still good for a laugh, and we're glad we saw it. Craig is always funny.",1382659200,3,312,4.131147540983607
5735079,4,B00CQRNLLU,It is a typical Craig Ferguson stand up routine. If you like his brand of humor you will like this. There is a lot of cussing and adult humor so be prepared.,1380672000,,157,3.9375
5735080,5,B00CQRNLLU,I love the comedy of Craig Ferguson. His stream of consciousness style of comedy is one of the best that I have seen. He has such a friendly demeanor about him and in his delivery style you almost think he is in your living room hanging out with you and a few friends.,1379808000,5,268,4.0754716981132075
5735081,4,B00CQRNLLU,but still hilarious. Craig remains an inspiration to anyone who is goofy. And I love that he offends people with no sense of the ridiculous,1379462400,,139,4.6
5735082,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Mr. Ferguson is unique (in the definitive usage of the word). He is the host of THE LATE LATE SHOW (CBS, 12:35 PM,E). Once there was only Carson -- now, about a zillion late night shows. His is simply the best and most sophisticated of them all -- even going back to ""Steverino,"" Paar...Letterman...Leno and the many ""Jimmies.""

Letterman is superb and I have watched about two-thirds of both his programs over the past 30 years. He began on NBC by deconstructing this venue. Now, Ferguson has gone far further in the deconstruction effort.

His sidekick is well... not a human being -- but rather a dead gay skeleton as they both converse during each program. So, the specter of the Grim Reaper is always part of the ambiance. Then a third regular -- again not human either is a make believe horse played by two guys in some sort of outfit. He converses with the non-speaking horse and translates the horse's physical motions for all of us. Bizarre? Yes!

He is constantly using blue material and dances (quite well) with either the horse or a few sexy ladies in ultra sexy outfits.

Then, he talks about his alcohol and drug addictions openly. Did I mention his attempt to commit suicide? This man born on Scotland has a European-existentialist approach to life and his ingenious comedy. Didn't someone say that tragedy and comedy are the same -- intertwined?

Who else on a network TV broadcast would allude to Nietche, Sartre, Brideshead Revisited, and... No one! Yet, the gig has lasted to date and he has a cult following. For me he is always appointment television via the CBS feed to my TV set or DVR.

He is rumored to replace David Letterman (whose company, World Wide Pants), is the producer of the nightly program. Well he can be effective at 12:35 -- but I have my doubts that he can maintain a large enough audience at 11:35 -- with his seemingly and probably improvisational style using a stream of consciousness technique. He is the best!

As far as his DVD goes... First get a copy. On CBS which is regulated by the FCC he codes his off-color comments. If you want to see him as he has the complete freedom to speak about anything he thinks or wants to say.

There are few working humorists and comedians presently working who are close to him. He has taken comedy to be an art form. (I guess you can say that I like him.}",1379116800,,2339,4.5260663507109005
5735083,5,B00CQRNLLU,It would be wonderful if Craig Ferguson had 28 more DVDs. Then we would have one for every day of the month. This one has a collection of 21 stories. He takes us from #1 GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA to #24 TRAVELING SALESMAN JOKE.  All of them are timely and hilarious. Thank goodness we never tire of him. We can watch this video over and over again.,1378252800,2,344,4.134328358208955
5735084,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Nobody other scotsman on CBS at night is as funny as Craig Ferguson. Actually he is my all time favourite Ferguson.

Would have loved to see the warm up show as well - maybe as a bonus on the DVD?!",1377993600,,197,3.925
5735085,3,B00CQRNLLU,"First off, I really like Craig Ferguson.  He's very funny on his show and really enjoy his irreverent character.

But this DVD started off slow, he pandered to the liberal DC crowd and seemed to try really hard at swearing allot. Not sure if the Scottish vocabulary is littered with American vulgarities because it did take away from the show.

Being a party animal ""back in the day"" can really appreciate Craig's brand of humor on those matters and the show picks up mid-way and ends with a few good laughs.

Still want to see him live and continue to be a fan. Just wish he wouldn't try so hard to carry on like some sort of trailer trash",1377820800,6,640,4.352941176470588
5735086,5,B00CQRNLLU,I'm such a HUGE Craig Ferguson fan so how could I possibly NOT love it!!  Not like seeing him live but next best thing.,1377648000,,119,3.9583333333333335
5735087,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Craig Ferguson is my favorite comedian and this DVD is a great showcase of his stand-up act.  It's a definite must-have for fans but anyone who likes to laugh will enjoy it.  Any time I need a little pick-me-up after a bad day, Ferguson is the perfect choice.",1377388800,,259,4.375

8585100,5,B00CQRNLLU,I love Craig's standup he is the best,1446940800,,37,3.75
8585101,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Craig's got another winner here.  I especially love his tirade against the scandal tabloids  his bit on Angelina Jolie, Jennifer  Aniston, and Brad Pitt is side-splittingly hilarious and right on target.  As in his previous live-performance video, ""Does This Need to be Said,"" Ferguson delights in interacting with his audience, and, simply put, I really enjoy watching him work.  I won't say this about many stand-up comedians, but I love it when Ferguson's putting things together in his head, and starts cracking up over what he's about to say.  I'm glad he takes us along for the ride....",1443744000,,592,4.989795918367347

8585105,5,B00CQRNLLU,"Hilarious as always live or on DVD. It helps with the withdrawals I'm experiencing now that CBS has pulled the show. And I might add, with a show that licks! It's just like all the other late night crap that's out there!",1431648000,,220,4.261904761904762
