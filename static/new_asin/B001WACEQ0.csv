8347275,5,B001WACEQ0,"Les Stroud and his wife spend a year in the Canadian wilderness, and encounter difficulties both in the forest and back home.
A very good documentary revealing the realities of ""escaping it all"" by living off the land; it's not as easily done as we imagine.",1464739200,,257,4.608695652173913
8347276,5,B001WACEQ0,"I found it really inspiring and recommend it to anyone looking for a very interesting documentary. They took some cool footage, some that's quite artistic even. Despite this they pull no punches when talking about their (almost) year living primitive in the Canadian wilderness.",1372032000,4,278,5.340909090909091
8347277,5,B001WACEQ0,"Howdy!

Excellent documentary about Les Stroud and his new wife trying to eek out a living in the Canadian Wilderness.  They are on their honeymoon and only leave the wilderness three times over the course of a year living primitively, for deaths in the family and medical emergencies (such as both Les and his wife getting Giardia, and his wife having a miscarriage).  They try to build shelter and survive the harsh conditions of the Canadian bush using only tools they can make themselves and food they bring in to stay healthy (it is their honeymoon, give them a break why don't ya). Worth watching if you are a Les Stroud fan or considering homesteading.

A word of warning though.  These sellers are way overpricing these DVD's as you can get them for $20 from Les Strouds own website and you would be supporting him instead of a re-seller.",1352160000,9,846,4.651006711409396
8347278,1,B001WACEQ0,"This was the worst DVD I have ever bought..Do yourself a favor and skip this one..horrible made, horrible subject manner and Les naked is awful !!!",1335225600,,147,4.6923076923076925
8347279,5,B001WACEQ0,"I had to leave a positive review after reading the previous reviewer's remarks about them leaving multiple times.  First of all, you know they didn't want to.  They had no other option.  I'm not going to spoil the story... but, let's just say they endured a lot of misfortune that year.  More so than most people go through in a decade.  Furthermore, doing something like this doesn't allow you to stop and start all over again.  It takes time, money, and commitment.  They dashed out of the bush when they had to and came right back as soon as possible.  It didn't ruin the adventure... it added to it.  You can't anticipate what will happen.  Most people couldn't last a week out in the woods.  They suffered through sickness for months.

Anyway... my rant is over.  It's a terrific documentary.  I own this and several similar wilderness movies.  I watch this one about twice a year.  Usually I stick it in the DVD player right when I am so fed up with civilization that I can't take it anymore.... especially when I can't get out to the bush myself.  It takes me to a wonderful place every time.",1318550400,9,1099,4.46969696969697
8347280,3,B001WACEQ0,I would have wanted to know that they made three trips out of the bush on an airplane before I made the purchase. In the preview it was said that they were going to be all alone under primitive conditions. It was primitive but what about the steel bow saw? What about the stove that was found?  What about their friends that brought in the chain saw? Other wise it was a very enjoyable story. A journey w Les Stroud is always exciting and eductional.,1291161600,5,450,4.294117647058823
