8316747,4,B001KZO1PE,"If you get this DVD, the film Get 'Em Off is on there as an extra. This is what I bought it for. Filmed mostly at London's Nell Gwynne Strip club in the late 70s, it brings back happy memories of the few occasions I went there. I fell in love with several of the girls there. You want to watch out for an Indian stripper (in a spiderweb - watch it, you'll see what I mean) who has to be one of the most perfectly formed human beings that I have ever seen. I also had a crush on the blonde girl (topless) behind the bar. She was a dancer too, although the film doesn't show this.

This is a precious little time capsule when Soho in central London was fun, before it became homogenised and boring. Strip clubs use to put on a proper show, with choreographed dancing and proper music, much better than the clumsy pole dancing you see nowadays.

Those two girls: I wonder what their names were and what they are doing now?",1413590400,,919,4.157303370786517
8316748,4,B001KZO1PE,"Arnold L. Miller and Stanley Long's documentary on the effect the Street Offences Act of 1959 had on vice crime in London is an historical look at the problem of London prostitution in the early to mid 1960's.

I first became aware of Miller's work through the BFI Flipside collection Miller presents his film as documentaries even though much of the film is staged for the camara's benefit. The Street Offences Act had as its principle aim the clearing of London's streets of its population of prostitutes. The act did not really change the situation but moved it to a newer playing field. Instead of the usual street walkers a new industry developed of near beer clip joint, call girl services and private hostess clubs now filling in the places left by the criminalization of prostitution. Miller presents the johns as hapless victims willing to be taken advantage of by a pretty face and the chance for affection.

This is a relatively short and quick 52 minute documentary which makes its points quite well. The film had the distinction of being banned in England by the censors for primarily political reasons. It appears that the censors did not want London seen in such a poor light. Miller and Long would go on to produce two of Britain's stranger mondo films:Lonon in the Raw and Primitive London in the years that followed and West End Jungle remains a good place to start any study of the directors.

Strike Force Entertainment presents the film on a standard definition DVD with some extra features. Included are two newsreels dealing with the Street Offenses Act  and a hort interview with Miller.

Check this one out for a view of London that no longer exists.",1383523200,,1675,4.7620689655172415
