8251452,5,B0013K8L8O,"One of the best DVDs showing Bukowski at a reading ever made. Period. He is so funny and his interaction with the rowdy crowd is hilarious. A must have for any Bukowski fanatic. The crowd gives it to Buk and he gives it right back, plus the reading of his poems are wonderful. The crowd quiets down and his voice just fills the room with the simple lines that are so profound.",1408060800,,376,4.236111111111111
8251453,4,B0013K8L8O,"This is an aptly named video.

There isn't a ton of video footage of Bukowski, so if you are a fan this is a must-see video.  Charles does get drunk throughout this reading and that is interesting as a fan of his novels and poetry, (things his Amazon critics are probably not capable of, by the way.)

However, let it be known that the video quality is very poor.  It was shot on video tape and obviously could not be digitized for so many years that we have the smearing, ghosting and other noise that goes with that.  It's not TOO bad though - we can see the man doing his thing well enough.  The photographer mostly stays zoomed in on him from a tripod, but there are occasional wider shots from the dark and smoky venue.

The reading featured a rambunctious Canadian crowd that apparently thought all of Bukowski's writing was comedy, then gets drunk and becomes somewhat wild.  This can be grating at times.  He handles it well and plays along with them, including the hecklers, and as he gets more drunk this gets more interesting to watch.  But if you adore his writing for his weighty points, you may find this experience annoying.  Still, it's worth it to see what he had to endure doing these readings, which he also wrote about so it's good to actually see and hear it.  Note: In the second half of the movie, the crowd is much more relaxed and quiet while he reads his work.

The audio is not a board recording; it was a microphone on the camera, (or near it,) which was in the audience.  So we have close-up crowd noise, which is particularly irritating during the first half of the film as there was a cackling moron very close to the microphone.  It's a shame.  After he is no longer audible, we begin to hear unexplained music coming from somewhere that doesn't quite fit into the experience.  Then the cackler returns, horribly, at the end of the picture in spite of our prayers.

If you aren't a stuck-up person or a person in recovery, I recommend starting this video with a drink and following suit with the program.  It will gel much better that way.  For those of you who don't understand Bukowski's writing style or lifestyle, remember that you are careening head-first into the same grave as everyone else.  You can relax and have a drink once in a while with a drunk poet.  I promise it won't hurt too badly.",1401494400,,2333,4.44
8251454,1,B0013K8L8O,"Bukowski likes his booze and drinks a couple of bottles while reading his poems in front of a live audience, mostly about sex and booze.  For anyone lacking an understanding poetry can be about anything, and anything can be expressed as ""poetry,"" and anyone wanting to see a drunk insult his audience and be insulted in return during a public reading, this might be ""enjoyed.""",1394582400,,376,4.7846153846153845
8251455,5,B0013K8L8O,"This is a good example of audience participation. The first few minutes the camera is blocked by someone later the catcalls and smartasses really start in on poor Chuck. But he rebuts & rebukes them in his inimitable style. You can see why he gave up public readings soon after this one,a classic!",1359331200,,297,4.622641509433962

8251457,5,B0013K8L8O,This was my first live view of Bukowski and I loved every minute of it. He is so real and he does not put up a front in order to be a highlight of society. I feel like his poetry shows that even the darkest corners of humanity have a wonderfully subjective beauty. This man inspires me and he is utterly entertaining.,1340496000,4,317,4.129032258064516
8251458,5,B0013K8L8O,"Vancouver was blessed by this atypical reading by the drunk Bukowski...a six bottles of wine event! The comments from the audience were pretty rowdy and Bukowski blew up at a couple who continuously interrupted his readings with their loud conversations about ""nothing"". Terrific stuff and a good performance by the ""master"".",1289952000,3,325,5.392156862745098
8251459,5,B0013K8L8O,"I bought this for my husband, a lifelong Bukowski fan.  He was very happy with it.
This dvd features Charles Bukowski at a poetry reading in Canada, in 1979.  He reads for less than two hours.  During that time, he interacts with the immature crowd and drinks 4 bottles of red red wine.  He also smokes some kind of cigarettes from India, and lights them over and over; to me what looked like a nervous habit.

The video was shot from within the crowd, and you can hear the obnoxious braying laughter of one particular man throughout the entire tape.

Equally annoying is the fact that so many people are laughing at poems that simply weren't intended to be humorous.  And then there are a few people in the audience who find themselves repeatedly shushed by Bukowski, because they continually talk over his readings.

All in all, it gives those of us not entirely familiar with the Bukowski live reading format the opportunity to see it, and the old Buk fans will certainly love this as much as anything else they can get their hands on that are related to the late-great Charles Bukowski.

A poetry reading - short, sweet and simple.  Or is it?",1230508800,14,1146,4.546341463414634
