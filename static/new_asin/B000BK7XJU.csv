It had, for me, too many travelogue-like scenes of the area where St. Clare lived and not enough substance of her life and spirituality  But I do like very much the second program on the disc, where nuns (or a nun) speak of their understanding of their mission in life and the spirituality that undergirds that mission.",1449619200,,370,4.590909090909091
