7839189,5,630311556X,"The best episode of the second season, by far. Data is one of those characters who you can do anything with and it will be good. This episode is no exception. The story of Picard fighting for Data's right to have his own life is as gripping as it is thought-provoking. Brent Spiner is amazing of course, the scene with him and Commander Maddox, who wants to take him under his command, just so he can disect him for information that will be helpful in creating his own andriod. The scene where Data tells him that he is resigning and that he is the result of his creator's own dream and that if destroyed, his dream would be destroyed. The court scene is also very gripping, with Riker as Maddox's ""lawyer"" and he gives a very devesting argement, by asking Data to bend a steel rod, removing Data's arm, and then shutting him off.""Pinocheo is broken, his strings have been cut"". The situation looks grim, until with Picard in Ten-Forward discuss that if Commander Maddox is successful, he can create a whole army of Data's, even creating a race. Then Picard comes up with the idea is that could also be grounds for slavery. This is the opening that the Captain needs, and then he goes on and brings Maddox to his knees, asking him if Data is intelligent, self-aware and consencess(sorry if thats spelled wrong). This leads to the judgement that Data was not the property of Starfleet, and he could refuse to withgo Maddox's experiment. This episode was wonderful as well forthcoming as the Matrix used this idea in even greater detail.",1106265600,,1535,4.605839416058394
7839190,4,630311556X,"I'm always a little disappointed when I watch this episode. It's sound in concept but uneven in execution.
Riker and Picard go head-to-head before a judge who must rule whether Data is a sentient being or not. Data is an android, so what should happen when he turns out to have wishes that conflict with those of his superior officers at Starfleet Command? Does he have the right to refuse to participate in a risky experiment, or not? Is he person like those around him, or a tool for their use?
It seems hard to believe that the practice of justice, in particular the adversarial process and arbitrary rulings by judges, has not changed at all in four hundred years. More than that, Riker's courtroom arguments really are nothing more than a sideshow display, making Picard's despondency about his own case very difficult to understand. The judge's final verdict draws on almost nothing of the arguments presented before her, which undercuts the point of Riker and Picard making their presentations at all. However, these problems are balanced to some degree by fine performances from all the actors, and some excellent interplay between Picard and Judge Louvois.
On a final note: it would have been good if the writers of Star Trek: The Next Generation had demonstrated some social change/progress from the twentieth century to the twenty-fourth, rather than just having the characters proudly claim that it has occurred. This was an episode crying out for such a context.",1075593600,3,1475,4.951612903225806
7839191,5,630311556X,"I was interested in watching this after watching the classic The Outer Limits episode, ""I Robot"" (episode 41), staring Leonard Nimoy where the same question was explored... also in a court room.
A lot of philosophy is explored in this episode.  But the acting is magnificent with the exception of Judge Advocate General Philipa Louvois who gave some poorly delivered and cheesy lines.  Plus for a JAG officer, she sure seems to be shocked by statements made in court more than you would think or believe.  But Jonathan Frakes, I believe, gives the best performance as he is given the unbearable task of actually prosecuting Data.  You could really feel his pain in performing the task he did not want to do.  This also has one of the better poker bits this show ever produced as Data plays poker for the first time.
Like ""I Robot,"" this makes you think.  While I developed my own ideas of who I thought was right and wrong and in between, this episode leaves enough open for you to explore your own ideas.  Which, I believe, is one of the strengths of this episode.",1060128000,3,1065,4.573684210526316
7839192,5,630311556X,"Too many people look at the Trek stories and shows as ""just science fiction"" but Gene Rodenberry had much more in mind.  This episode stayed true to Rodenberry's vision and made us think and question.  It looked at themes of Civil Rights and Slavery.. it looked at ethics, morality and science all intermingling.
The character of Lt. Commander Data the android crewmember was an ingenious invention of the Next Generation writers.  Each time they explored his character the more interesting he became.  This, however, is the best of those explorations of character.  It could be used in an ethics class! It is a definate ""must see!""",1054684800,,632,4.9245283018867925
7839193,5,630311556X,"The nature of what it is to be alive is a question which many humans, to their detriment, take for granted in the twenty-first century. The truth is that history shows that red blood does not always make ""human"" in the eyes of those who hold the control levers on the machine of power. Every race that has ever known slavery has known what it is to be what the Nazis called ""untermaenschlich,"" subhuman.
The question in this episode does not concern Data's humanity directly, but the more fundamental question of whether or not he truly does live. In summary, Maddox lists the qualifications for sentience as possessing self-consciousness or self-awareness, the ability to addapt to change, and the ability to seek out knowledge or actively learn. The quintessential moment of the episode occurs when Picard forces the commander to agree that his subject, Data, does in fact meet all of his own, Maddox's, stated criteria for sentience.
Realization and compensation for human ignorance is not a phenomenon which stops in the twenty-fourth century either. Consider the Judge Advocate General's ruling and the catharsis it envokes. The observer empathizes with her pain and regret brought about by her all-too-human arrogance.
In the end, there are simply some principles which cannot be sacrificed for science. And as human experimentation is decried by many, so too does Data make his own feelings abundently clear. It is Data who may represent the views of this fan when he says: ""Commander, I formally refuse to participate in your experiment. Do not worry sir, when you are ready, I will still be here.""",1043798400,,1606,4.996268656716418
7839194,5,630311556X,"Commander Data is to be 'retrieved' by famed Starfleet scientist Commander Bruce Maddux for ... disassembly?
This exceptional morality play about the nature of existence has wonderful depth for being a mere forty-plus minutes.  In record time, it manages to deal with such titillating sci-fi subjects as the man vs. machine controversy, a person's right to choose, and even slavery.
Brent Spiner, as Commander Data, is at top form in this episode, given perhaps the greatest story possible: a story tinkering with a hidden sense of euthanasia and his right, as a manufactured being, to make the choices that determine his fate.  Picard Stewart, as his captain and defense attorney in court, gives an incredibly stirring speech about the nature of epistemology.
Another must-see ... but not just for Trek fans.",1011830400,8,809,5.1679389312977095
7839195,5,630311556X,In this one Starfleet wants to study Data and declare him as property!  Starfleet wants to build an army of Datas so humans won't have to endure the dangers of space travel.  Amanda McBroom plays the JAG officer that wants to put Data into the hands of Starfleet.  Riker argues that Data is nothing but a machine. He presents an argument that eventually does help him.  Picard portrays Data's advocate.  Both convince the JAG officer (Judge Advocate General) that Data is a sentient being and has the right to pursue his own life.  We all know Data gets to resume his career; however it does make another second season standout episode.,997228800,2,636,4.684684684684685
7839196,5,630311556X,"This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" takes on a classic science fiction theme: the rights and dignity of sentient artificial beings. ""The Measure of a Man"" ranks right up there with the best of such explorations. The combination of an intelligent script and superb acting makes this one that bears repeat watching.
Lieutenant Commander Data, the android bridge officer on the starship ""Enterprise,"" is faced with the unpleasant prospect of being disassembled against his will by an obsessed Starfleet cybernetics expert. Scriptwriter Melinda Snodgrass effectively uses the dramatic device of a legal hearing as the vehicle by which to present a philosophical inquiry into the crucial questions: Is Data ""alive""? Does he have inalienable rights? Would forcing him into actions against his will amount to slavery?
The performances are uniformly good. Special mention should be made of Brent Spiner's portrayal of Data: it is a masterfully nuanced performance which engages the viewers' sympathy. And Patrick Stewart, as Data's captain and courtroom defender, delivers his key pieces of oratory with passionate integrity.
As I noted above, this television episode can be read as part of a greater science fiction tradition. But in its exploration of the enduring conflict between individual rights and the forces of exploitation, ""The Measure of a Man"" is also a worthy successor to the literature of the anti-slavery activists of the 19th century. Watch ""The Measure of a Man"" and then read an abolitionist classic like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" ""The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"" or ""David Walker's Appeal."" With ""The Measure of a Man,"" the ""Star Trek"" creative team has produced an episode that is full of moral relevance.",973900800,9,1745,5.303249097472924
7839197,5,630311556X,"This is one of my all-time favorite TNG episodes. In a nutshell: starfleet wants to disect Data for nefarious purposes. Picard convinces old flame to hold hearing to establish Data's personhood. Old flame assigns Riker to  represent starfleet. (When Riker tries to refuse, she threatens to declare  Data a toaster.) Hearing ensues... I was impressed when I saw this  first-run and I'm STILL impressed. ""Measure of a Man"" asks the  question: ""What defines sentience?"" But it also asks the more  profound question: ""What defines humanity?""  The hearing is both  touching and thought-provoking. I found myself wondering if *I'd* be  declared sentient under the same circumstances. Spiner's performance gives  Data a gentle dignity and compassion that just shines. Too many great lines  to list. Stand-out scene when Riker removes Data's arm at the hearing and  says: ""I'm sorry.""  A must-have for all TNG fans.",948585600,6,907,5.265734265734266
7839198,5,630311556X,"Data is thrust into a trial to determine whether or not he is Starfleet property,  or a living being with the same rights to life as all other Starfleet officers.  One of my personal top ten!  A must see for all Data  fans!",930009600,4,223,4.116279069767442
