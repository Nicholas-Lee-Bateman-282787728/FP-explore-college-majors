8200180,2,B000REWYXK,"This is a tough one. While, as a devotee, which is hella more than *fan*, of horror and classic horror and the Golden Age of Hollywood, I was very much looking forward to a probably obscure, not necessarily great little film about the man who so powerfully [for all time] realized the great monsters, when that was not easy with the makeup, lighting, and film available in that long-ago era.

So just personally, I feel I'd have to respect the actors and directors and producers out there who would want to make sure Jack Pierce and his peerless contributions are memorialized. Sadly, an honorable, because minimally watchable, memorial or historic exploration does not happen here. This is a mess.

This is one of the worst amateur products I've seen on Amazon. Documentaries of quality are not that difficult to make; you leave out the dramatizations [which are hard even for National Geographic to effectively pull off] and too often play like other reviewers  here mentioned -- a highschool drama club performance or blatant vanity project assembled by people who have simply not understood that in the last 30 years, people expect much more from any film project offered for sale at any price.

While I live in a theatre town, and would've lined up in a New York minute to see any type or scale theatre event on Jack Pierce, and would've totally forgiven such a theatre production because it *wasn't* a documentary film, but a stage piece on the order of a one-man show, I have to say this documentary is not worth watching for useful information even.

Apparently someone from the crew made a comment on another strongly negative review to the effect that defects in this film should be forgiven because the CD had more info. Dude, I didn't buy a CD, I'm renting via Amazon, and this is a bad film any way you look at it, if you are not part of the crew/friends/family.

The dramatization monologue is so far behind the current standards of the last 20-30 years for this sort of thing,  as to be unwatchable. It's not vintage aesthetics of a period piece that's generating negative reviews here, it's bad writing and bad filmmaking, along with bad acting [which might not be the actor's fault, hard to say].  Basic documentary standards that would appeal to anyone other than friends/family of crew and made this watchable have totally been ignored.

I've seen extremely low budget documentaries made by family members or individual servivors, say,  about murders and paranormal topics that had far less history and glamour to draw on that were actually worth watching and paying to watch.  There are great documentaries made with still photos and voice overs all over the place. Allowing bad writing and bad directing for the sake of adding dramatization to a documentary is bad film making and unnecessary.",1483056000,,2814,4.82952182952183

8200182,2,B000REWYXK,"Admittedly, this one isn't going to appeal to people who aren't fans of the Universal Monsters or their behind the scenes legends. I happen to be a huge fan of Jack Pierce's work, given the times and technology that he became famous in. That said, this was remarkably bad! It isn't a documentary, but a recording of a one-man play of someone pretending to be Jack Pierce, giving an account of his life. It seemed as though it could've been recorded on a VHS-camera with a tripod. Also, it would've helped had we not been able to see that the actor was reading his lines from the book in his lap. It may have picked up in the second half, but I'm not sure. I stopped watching due to the quality.",1448409600,,694,4.305343511450381
8200183,5,B000REWYXK,"Like most fans of this underappreciated make up genius, we're all been looking for an elaborate documentary on the man behind the monsters. Jack Pierce the creator of The Frankenstein Monster, The Mummy and The Wolf Man, and countless others is often overlooked by those outside the ""monster club"" in which I'm a proud member of.

I've had some contact by mail in the past with Mr. Essman and have found him to be a sincere person who truly loves this stuff as much as I do. This DVD isn't going to be the end all for those clambering for the definitive Jack Pierce documentary, but it does shed some light on his life both fortunate and tragic.

The DVD's main portion is an one time only show with actors portraying his various creations and his associates through out his life. I wish I could say that it is all good, for it is not. The good stuff, great recreations of his monsters on atmospheric sets, the bad....well the acting is a bit over the top and amateurish. I don't mean to be harsh, but I've worked in theater and these actors are just laying it on way too thick.

The DVD also has some cool little extras, such as a Jack Pierce time line of his life and accomplishments, Trailer for the DVD with Bob Burns showing off one of his and last surviving Pierce mask of the Mummy, some stills, short making of feature-ette and a few more trinkets.

Overall I would give this production a 3 star rating because I know all involved must care about the material and man who created the most memorable monsters of all time and never got his due......can you believe Universal fired this guy!??? What a bunch of ungrateful %$#@! yep I said it!

Why did I give this 5 stars, when I stated it was a 3 star production?,... well that is because there are some unjust one star reviews for this item so I wanted to even out the overall score.",1399507200,2,1840,4.368421052631579
8200184,1,B000REWYXK,"Badly written, performed, with bad lighting and sound, crude and laughable sets and filmed by amateurs, this one-off performance is obviously a backer's audition/vanity production for the writer/performer and the make-up designers. I learned more about Jack Pierce from the historical timeline included as an extra. If you were trying to give Hollywood film makers a bad reputation you succeeded.",1382486400,,396,5.616666666666666
8200185,1,B000REWYXK,"As a previous reviewer stated, I too was expecting a professional documentary-style program on the life and career of Jack Pierce... not an actor doing a reading in the first person AS Jack Pierce. (And in response to another previous reviewer, it's mighty hard to know that this is not as it's described without watching it first... I'll skip the emoticon.)

""Amateurish"" and ""dull"" are the two words that come first to my mind. With the amount of material that must be available on this remarkable man, I'm beyond disappointed that this is the best anybody could do.  To add insult to injury, both the sound quality and picture quality are very bad; the lighting is atrocious. When a second actor with a laboring accent showed up and started speaking as Conrad Veidt, I gave up.

My consolation is that I got it as a 7-day streaming rental and did not purchase it outright. My recommendation is, ""Don't bother"".",1347926400,,913,4.729559748427673

8200187,1,B000REWYXK,"Jack Pierce was a remarkable man - responsible for the look and success of the golden age of monster films. In buying this dvd, I was hoping for a straightforward documentary with an assortment of film clips and stills. Although the product description describes the film as a ""live biography including recreations of 15 of his characters"" I was completely unprepared for the paucity of the actual film.
  This is a filmed one-time performance, or more correctly a read-through, stage presentation of Jack Pierce as an old man reminiscing about his life in the movie industry. I suspect that he actor portraying him is actually quite skilled, but why does he give him this strange, wavering German accent? Especially since one of the miserable little extras is a brief interview with the actual Jack Pierce, who appears to have no accent at all. And speaking of those extras, a few still pictures apparently in public domain with special software scrapbook effects!? Rest assured, there are no film clips at all, nor are there stills detailing Pierce's technique.
  I cannot say anything good about the actors who recreate his characters, so I won't say anything at all. The only reason you might purchase this dvd is if you already have a huge classic monster library and must have this obscure little student exercise to make it complete.",1230681600,10,1340,4.915929203539823
