8086059,5,B000BFH2RI,"gotta love this show! lots of action, so many car crashes that it became too expensive to produce. After it shut down in the US, it became the number 1 hit in Germany. This is one cop show where both characters  have a love interest. Steve William's character owns a gym, and Wolf Larsen's is an artist",1424217600,,302,4.298245614035087
8086060,4,B000BFH2RI,I enjoyed watching L.A. Heat on TV and decided to add it to my collection.  It is an intense thrill ride of a show.,1377216000,3,115,3.7916666666666665
8086061,5,B000BFH2RI,There is a lot of cop shows out there from the 40s to the 90s but LA HEAT takes the cake a lot of chases and stunts and the nice thing about it they are both good friends in this one the only dislike was when Chase got killed but unfortunately that is what happens to police men today so buy it and think of all the police men that put their lives on the line every day.,1373068800,2,370,3.7564102564102564
8086062,1,B000BFH2RI,"I'm very happy if the Digi-Pack arrived today but the happiness was not long. I put in the first DVD and saw the catastrophe. The master of this show is good but the DVD-label made a very very poor encoding. Every scene with faster movements or explosions are blocking and pixeling like a bad VCD before 10 years. That's not the way to sell a very good action tv show.

My own recordings from the german tv are better and has a Mbps of 5.000 or a little more in peaks. This original digi-pack has a Mbps of 3.500.

Please ignore this bad quality digi-pack, so we can hope of a better release by a better label.

The tv show self are a 5 stars action show in my opinion.

In the future it will be better if more customers wrote about the dvd quality and not the quality of shows or films.",1231113600,4,787,4.124183006535947
8086063,5,B000BFH2RI,I remember watching this show when I would get home from college in the late afternoon on TNT. The action is great and are the two main characters.  This is a show that never takes itself seriously (unlike many shows today. It just good old action and fun.,1220227200,3,256,4.333333333333333
8086064,5,B000BFH2RI,"At least, thats how I call it, and it's not meant as an insult. This is one of my favorite cop shows of the 90s - Barney Miller meets Hill Street Blues. Fans of 21 Jump Street will recognize Captain Fuller as Detective Brooks. I'll be crushed if the rest of the series isn't released.",1156464000,5,284,4.181818181818182
