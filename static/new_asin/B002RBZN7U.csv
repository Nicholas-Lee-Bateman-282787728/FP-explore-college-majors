3972253,5,B002RBZN7U,"This video is 3 1/2 hours of guitar building instruction and entertainment! Another viewer disliked it because there is a segment where he is working outside and the reviewer thought he would see a guitar being built in a guitar factory. As a beginning home builder I could care less how the factories do it! I want to see a musician building a guitar in his backyard and garage with the basic of tools. And that is just what Mr. Dewar does in this video. I learned a lot of tricks and techiniques from watching this video and I will be watching it again and again for a long, long time!",1282348800,,587,4.297297297297297
3972254,2,B002RBZN7U,"i was snooping around the internet before xmas, looking at dvds to keep me occupied over the holiday break....
my missus saw what i was doing and offered to buy me a dvd from amazon.com as an xmas gift,
dvd was called ""A complete custom electric guitar build""

i agreed to purchase it, expecting to watch a professional guitar builder do some work in a professional shop,
thinking that maybe i would pick up some better/easier ways to do certain processes during building and maybe get some ideas for jigs....

what i got was a long dvd with a man who started off working on a table outdoors, then in a small green room (or was it blue) with a bench, and minimul tools,

(imo) he used very primative methods and did alot of bad things during the dvd.

-off the top of my head:
sanding the whole body, front and back with a belt sander against the grain.
sanded the fretboard against the grain,
used steel wool without covering the pickups in any way,
using a large (saber?) saw in a dangerous fashion,

he glues the guitar to his table,
this is NO DOUBT the most pathetic thing i have ever seen,
all that ran through my head when i watched him clamping the thing on the table was, WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

he also screwed around and made some immature comments in regards to consuming the clear finish he was using.
maybe im just being harsh, but i think to a novice who would like to build their first guitar, all that stuff would just create confusion (and possibly cause injury concerns).

he also did an aweful job of the inlays, i would never try to sell something with such problems (hence why i am yet to do any other inlays than timber, plastic and pearl dots).

he also put the stew mac hotrod truss rod in upside down,
now iv never heard of it being used this way,
but he seems to think it works,
so if it can be put in upside down (adjusting rod on the top) then i appologise :)

he also had a cat in the workspace,
and didn't tie his hair back. (thats like... oh&s rule number two right there)

now, i am not a pro, and i do not have a registered guitar building buisness as of yet,
but i do know a fair bit on the subject and have built a fair few custom solid body 6 & 7 string guitars and a bass, so i think im entitled to my opinions :)
and tbh i am appauld that he is marketing such a dvd.
that being said, i have nothing against the guy,
its just not a dvd i would ever recomend to anyone, and i am very unhappy with the purchase.

all in all, i probably got an idea for 2 jigs, and a bit of info on buffing,

the 30 or 40bux i paid could have bought something alot better.....",1264464000,9,2632,4.119140625
3972255,5,B002RBZN7U,"The subtitle to this DVD and accompanying 16 page booklet is ""From tree to guitar"" and that is exactly what you get. Everything on this DVD, the level of detail of the instruction, the skills demonstrated and the quality of the videography is first class. Furthermore, the entire package is infused with the genuine passion of Mr. Dewar which is perhaps what makes it not just good but excellent. Highly recommended for anyone interested in electric guitars, just to see the process, even if you never actually build one yourself.",1262476800,,530,4.9
3972256,5,B002RBZN7U,"I have always wanted to make a guitar.  I have various ideas in mind.  And this DVD is a great start.  Now, you can follow every step this guy makes in making the exact guitar.  But, you can use your own design and follow on how he handles certain situation.  This is quite an informative DVD.  I have read a couple of books, but to actually see the practice is great.

This DVD starts from cutting down a tree, curing the wood, shaping, cutting, cluing and ultimately finishing the guitar.  It is a complete step by step on how a guitar can be built.  Although, I won't go far in cutting down an actually tree, I will purchase the wood already cured and treated.  But, all the rest will definitely be considered.

There are times involving the electronic aspect that threw me off, but you can learn the basics.  Also, setting intonation has been a problem for me. Especially with my purchased guitars.  But, he does make it look easy.  And a good way in maintaining your original instruments.

Go out and buy this DVD if you want to know what it takes to make your own guitar.  I plan to make my own someday.",1262390400,,1109,4.336585365853659
3972257,5,B002RBZN7U,"This DVD will appeal not only to hardcore guitar building enthusiasts who want to march off into the forest, cut down a tree and build a guitar from scratch, but also to those who might want to get information on how to upgrade an already existing guitar, and even those who might never actually build a guitar in their lives, but who enjoy a well-presented and lively documentary showing a skilled artisan at work.  ""A Complete Custom Electric Guitar Build"" is more than a mere ""how-to"" program.  I can actually imagine sitting down and watching this on the Discovery network (though at almost 3 1/2 hours it might need to be spread over two or three evenings!).  Even my 5 year old son was fascinated, particularly by the tree-cutting parts, but also he loved watching the instrument take shape, from a formless block of raw wood, to the beautiful, finished product.  The music, which was written especially for the DVD, provides a fitting soundtrack, and the 16 page booklet that accompanies the DVD is far more than your usual slip of paper that often contains only credits and a few photos; it offers lots of instruction and photos to complement the contents of the DVD.

Overall, I give this DVD a well-deserved ""thumbs-up"" and can heartily recommend it!",1256256000,,1260,4.761467889908257
3972258,5,B002RBZN7U,"Fantastic Guitar Building DVD. There's nothing like this out there... You can read as many books as you like on guitar making but there is nothing better than actually seeing someone do it. Great product, great price.

Most reviews on this site are from people that haven't watched the actual dvd and have made presumptions based on youtube previews!!! The dvd is great. The Truss rod can infact be fitted either way (bi-directional) and it IS explained in the dvd why you would want to fit it that way (a fact that is only apparent to the buyers of this film!)

I can't believe some reviewers on here actually would prefer the film to be more of a gruelling three and a half hour experience! You Americans and your strange ways...",1256256000,3,731,4.572519083969466

It gave me the confidence I needed to start building my first guitar.
I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1484956800,,174,4.833333333333333

8378575,5,B002RBZN7U,"All the time skip to order this! just for the price and finally did the order, this DVD is perfect and pretty well explain everything about how to built electric guitar from a tree, electronics, pickups, lacquer, body and neck!! the price is nothing for all the information.",1385164800,,274,4.729166666666667
8378576,5,B002RBZN7U,Very interesting.  I would of liked to see more about lacquering and painting. Learned a lot from this video.  The guy is cool too.  Love the video,1363996800,,147,4.37037037037037
8378577,4,B002RBZN7U,"This DVD is good for an overview of guitar building. I did learn a good bit from it, just wish there were more details at various parts making it easier to follow. Guess that's what the books are for. Definitely get some accompanying books.",1363132800,,240,4.4772727272727275
8378578,5,B002RBZN7U,"Since I bought this DVD I think I've watched it at least 20 times. It's both a very good and detailed presentation of how to build a custom electric guitar and it's also fun to watch because it's not a typical sanitized company produced video where people with frozen fake smiles read off teleprompters and everything is scripted and devoid of anything human. In this video Antony Dewar is describing what (and why) he is doing as he is doing it, in whatever words come (or not) to him at the moment, giving you a great insight into numerous little details and tricks that most novice guitar builders (and many experienced ones) could otherwise very easily miss.

The video follows every step of making an electric guitar and, unlike most available books or videos on the subject, it starts with felling a (dead) tree and goes all the way through cutting it into boards, drying them (in a home built kiln), and then into the actual guitar building, including even such details as mother of pearl inlay and potting pickups. Most of the tools used are not too expensive (hand tools, for the most part) and anyone who is even thinking of making a guitar by themselves probably already has most of them, except for a few specialized guitar making hand tools.

All those things that one of the reviewers listed as negative I actually find very positive; the best example being when Antony glued the body of the guitar to the table by mistake - it would have been easy to edit that out, but they left it deliberately because it's a good way for people to learn not to do it, to learn to pay attention to such details that could cost them a lot of aggravation if they miss them. Plus - it's human and it's funny. I've been gluing a wooden frame today and that scene from the video kept popping up in my mind, so I paid extra attention to wipe the oozing glue off before it reached the table and I was smiling all the time while doing it - if it wasn't for this DVD I don't think I would have been careful enough.

If there's any critique I could give it would be that I'd love to see this DVD accompanied with a book, for the nerds among us who love learning from technical drawings, pictures, tables, etc. or who like to know a lot more details than is actually needed to successfully build an electric guitar.

For me this is definitely a 5 star DVD. Too bad the new one (Pimp That Strat) isn't available on Amazon, but I'm ordering it directly from ACD Guitars and I'm sure it will be as good as this one.",1349913600,,2501,4.372043010752688
8378579,4,B002RBZN7U,"I personally think that this was a pretty good video, I am building a guitar as a project, and I have not built one before. I have done quite a bit of research into
building guitars, and seen that he does do a few things wrong, but the thing that stood out to me while he was building the guitar is that he was having a lot of
fun doing it, and it shows through in the video. Yes, I was expecting a formal video, giving step by step instructions for how to construct a guitar, and that the
three hours I would be watching this video would be dead serious, but I had a laugh while learning how to build this guitar, and I would recommend it to any of
my neighbors or family.

  As I said before, he does make a few mistakes. They are as follows:
-Gluing the Guitar to the Table
-Inserting the StewMac HotRod Truss Rod Upside down
-And didn't tie his hair back.

  I have to admit, I did think that it was funny when he glued the guitar to the table, but no actual damage was done to the guitar. There was some glue on the
back of the guitar, and it was fixed by sanding it all off, so there really was no harm done. I think they were going to cut it out, but decided that it was too funny
to cut out. Also, it brings it to your attention to put wax paper underneath the guitar, so as to avoid this mistake he made. Everything worked out fine in the end
with his guitar, and it looks beautiful after it is finished.

  I do agree that a bit of the video is quite cheezy, where he uses unnecessary camera effects that just look weird and make your opinion of the video go down
slightly, like where he is about to saw the wood, and uses appearing effects.

All in all, I think that this is a wonderful video that is out there, and I am very glad that I purchased it. I hope that when I start building my guitar in a few weeks,
that I have as much fun with it as he did.",1303603200,2,1865,3.949333333333333
