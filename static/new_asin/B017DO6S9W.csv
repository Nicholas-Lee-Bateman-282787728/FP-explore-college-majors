8738730,5,B017DO6S9W,"Very wity film. very ironic, much of intentionally. Laugh out loud funny sometimes, Everyone is well cast and the film is a hoot. Though it is supposed to take place in ny/long island area, its easy enough to see its actually california..

Charles Boyer is charming and plays the straight man with wit and aplomb. Dick Shawn is the prototype sensitive man of today. Rock Hudson is charming,witty, and ironic beyond words. Leslie Caron goes from frigid to volcanic and her character becomes funnier along the way.

I won't give away the plot, its a pleasure to see it unravel before your eyes. No nudity, no swear words, no sex and yet Rock Hudson, described it as the ""filthiest film he'd made up to that point"". You see, the brain can make us see what our eyes cannot.

Probably not the wittiest film ever made, nor the most emotionally challenging or dramtic, but if its laughs you crave, then this is a platter full of them. Its a nice slice of 60's romcom. Very politically incorrect, very sexist, very funny, if your easily offended, you should rent a National Geographic DVD and watch the mating habits of penguins or something. This is an adult comedy and there seems to be so few adults left in the world. Enjoy it while you can, it will probably be burned at the next ritual book burning of our tolerant society.",1529280000,,1321,4.565400843881856

8738736,4,B017DO6S9W,"I've seen this Rock Hudson movie, And I like it. Granted Doris Day isn't Rock's leading lady in this BUT Leslie Caron wasn't bad either. She was a good match for Rock in this movie. I thought Charles Boyer as Leslie Caron's father was GREAT in this movie as was Walter Slazak, Dick Shawn as the WIMPY boyfriend of Leslie Caron and Nita Talbot as Mickey the telephone operator. The ending to this movie SWEET and very funny I think.",1447718400,,431,4.4
