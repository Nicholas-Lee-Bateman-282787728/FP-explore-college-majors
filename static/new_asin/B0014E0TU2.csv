3130428,5,B0014E0TU2,"I ""discovered"" Wilford Brimley on this excellent TV series (not realizing that I'd seen him before in Absence of Malice, The Natural, The China Syndrome, etc.). Brimley, who plays a retired grandfather of three grandkids, and a rock of wisdom & stability to a widowed daughter-in-law, is all man - a rough, tough, loving and comforting protector of hearth and home. While the rest of the cast is good, especially Deidre Hall, Brimley makes the show. His power and presence hooks you and may take you back to the day when someone was looking out for your best interests.

This show lasted only two seasons. Why? In this era of 'reality TV' America must want to focus more on fractured or non-existent families than it wants to be reminded of the benefits of close-knit & secure homes. Don't get me wrong. There's no schmaltz or goody-two-shoes here. This show is zero 'preachy'. It's just 5 people trying to deal with the outside world. But it subtly and entertainingly reminds us that a close and loving family is the best of all available options for where and how to safely incubate and cultivate future adults.",1232841600,26,1113,4.737113402061856

8255375,5,B0014E0TU2,"Please someone make this show available in dvd. I was always crazy about this show. I just saw Wilford Brimley on a commercial and, other than a bit of a weight gain, he looked the same as in the mid 80's when the show was running. They should have made more seasons. Wilford Brimley also played a character in The Waltons. I agree, he made Our House.",1296777600,,351,4.253731343283582
8255376,5,B0014E0TU2,I check Amazon.com almost daily just waiting to be able to order Our House.  I watched it every Sunday night!  It was the best show and I loved the people who were on it.  I can't believe it only lasted 2 seasons.  I just hope that when it becomes available they will go ahead and release the whole series and not just Season 1.  I'M WAITING!!!!!,1252972800,14,346,4.181818181818182
