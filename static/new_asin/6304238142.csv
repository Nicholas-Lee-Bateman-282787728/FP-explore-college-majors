813674,5,6304238142,"This movie may not appeal some because of it is critcism from various people such as TV Guide.  They think that the movie is nothing but another mindless B flick.  It is a B flick as they say.  However, it is scary and  entertaining.
  The movie is about a town that is being devastated by  the horrific outcomes of experiments.  The men are being killed in a  gruesome fashion and the woman are being raped.  The people are scared and  bewildered and wonder if they will be next.
  The ones involved in the  experiment soon find themselves tracking the creatures down.  When they  come face to face with one, they immediately bring it to a laboratory.  They realize that there is more than one, and they are about to strike  again.
  As the body count rises, the suspense builds up and you will  keep your eyes glued to the television screen until the heart pounding  spine tingling bone chilling gory climax.  Some may think the effects are  cheesy and unoriginal, but they are still scary nonetheless.
  It  contains many rape scenes and lots of nudity.  If you don't like to see a  lot of sex or full frontal female nudity, then I suggest that you skip this  film.
  This movie also contains extreme gore.  The body count is  high, and each death involves blood and gore.  Some are tame, and others  are graphic.  If you do not like movies with extreme gore and violence, I  suggest you skip this one.
  The script is pretty well written and the  lines are not as cheesy as others.  There is hardly any humor, but it is  not supposed to be.  The cast give outstanding performances, and they do  not seem like those streotypes in some slasher films.  I would recommmend  this to anyone who wants to see a scary Roger Corman B movie.",966729600,12,1735,4.448387096774193
813675,3,6304238142,"When was the last time you saw a 2 legged humanoid mutant salmon / coelacanth combo chasing its bikini clad teen-age prey on a boardwalk's merry-go-round? Probably the same time you saw the newly crowned Miss  Salmon at the same boardwalk bludgeon another humanoid with a piece of  masonry.  Yep, toss in the Shatner-esque late model Doug McLure, an evil  Vic Morrow, and a few dozen convincing salmon monsters and you have a  Corman classic. Does the back story matter? Well, sure, isolated fishing  village languishes while a nearby research facility works to genetically  produce superior salmon.  Of course a batch escapes into the wild and mates  with every crypto zoologists favorite fish, the 70 million year `extinct'  coelacanth.  The resulting progeny grow into shambling golem style  freakers, attacking bathing beauties in an attempt to er, spawn.  Never  mind the boyfriends, they're quickly dispatched in a shower of red dye.  Marvel at the Prophecy-esque sub-plot between the local Indian trying to  save his land and Vic Morrow, resident bully.  What we're left with after  the finale on the boardwalk are more questions [but not before McLure gets  a chance to try out that rifle on the dang land fish], and a final scene  nod to Alien.  While it was amusing to be brought under the schlock spell  for a few hours, let's just say I'm glad I caught this on the dish, for  free.",960336000,3,1393,4.858974358974359

I would love to see the Edgar Rice Burroughs's movies remade with today special effect's, I was surprised the "" John Carter of Mars"" movie was not better received...but in retrospect people probably don't realize the books these movies are based on were written decades before "" Star Wars"" or "" Jurassic Park"" & therefore probably not given the respect due to these old classics put on film.",1470182400,4,1123,4.534653465346534

813965,5,6304238142,"My friends and I wore the VHS US version of this movie out when we were kids. It was one of our favorite horror flicks. I'm sure we watched the infamous tent scene at least 100 times. Until recently, it was one of those lost movies that you could not find on DVD or in digital format. When I saw this Blu-Ray release of the original uncut International version, I could not resist.

Yes, it is a corny 1980 horror movie with large sea creatures runnning around killing people and a little gratuitous nudity, but that is what makes it great. To me it is similar to the original Jaws movie as far as entertainment. If you enjoyed this movie as a child I'm sure you will love it again on Blu-Ray. I also like the bonus reversible cover that you can flip around in the Blu-Ray sleeve to display the international movie cover or the Us cover.",1461715200,2,837,4.2974683544303796

813969,4,6304238142,"First of all, this is a ""Roger Corman Classic"" , so you should have some idea what you're getting into right off the bat. If you can accept that and are game to continue watching, you're in for a pretty great low budget monster movie.

Things start out in a sleepy fishing town in Northern California. There are already some tensions brewing between your typical red neck townies and the local native tribe about fishing rights. On top of that, a big cannery is showing interest in the town which could heavily impact the environment. The men who make their living on fishing boats obviously are all for the big money company moving in, but the tribes people are completely against it due to the damage that it could do to their land and their own subsistence fishing.

All of a sudden strange ""accidents"" start plaguing the fishermen, including a missing boy and a boat explosion. Pets are also disappearing at an alarming rate. Naturally, they attribute this to a native ""trouble maker"" . This battle begins to escalate, all the while other even stranger things keep happening.

 It's not long before the real menace is uncovered.  MUTATED HUMAN SIZE SALMON CREATURES. Yes, you read that correctly. The interesting twist here is that,  like normal non mutant salmon, these creatures have come inland from the sea to mate...and not with other mutant salmon or regular salmon. Let that sink in for a minute. Yeah. So a bunch of highly territorial, hormone crazy, mutant fish men start attacking any menfolk they come across and absconding with any of the local women unlucky enough to get caught by the fish (IRONY!!!) to continue their mating frenzy with. This crazy fish lust is discovered by one of the locals and a visiting environmental scientist, who then set out to stop the slimy beasts. Before they can get the word out, the annual Salmon Fest fair kicks off down at the pier with lots of locals showing up to see who's going to be crowned Salmon Queen , and a small army of Humanoids show up to get lucky, and all hell breaks loose.

As bizarre as all of that sounds,  it all makes a peculiar kind of sense.  Amazingly, it makes a pretty damn entertaining movie too. The crew really got every penny's worth out of the monster suits and they look great for a Corman production. The cast is a solid group of unknowns who perform admirably. As per most of Mr. Corman's films, there is a TON of nudity and gore. In the end, Humanoids turns out to be a really well done B-movie and my 2nd favorite Corman Classic ( Behind the incredible DEATH RACE 2000 ).

The ""Roger Corman Classics"" brand always delivers a great DVD. Usually far better than the film itself deserves. You get a bunch of cast interviews, behind the scenes FX talk with a few guys who went on to do truly amazing work on other features, and all sorts of bells and whistles. If you are a fan of the movie, you can absolutely not go wrong with this release.

There's no denying that Roger Corman was a brilliant guy, and he knew what his 80s home video rental audience wanted. The movie is a little dated, but still holds up pretty well. Any fan of monster movies, especially from the golden age of low budget greatness, should appreciate this movie for what it is. The greatest movie about horny mutant fish-men ever made!!!!",1454630400,3,3296,4.569491525423729

814052,5,6304238142,"This is the movie Joe Dante turned down and Barbara Peeters accepted.  Unfortunately, she thought she was making one kind of a movie while Roger Corman was expecting her to make quite another.  Enter Jimmy T. Murakami who ""fixed"" the film by adding some much needed spice (exploitation).  Supposedly, the actors were outraged by the addition of nudity (apparently, they had no problem accepting the gratuitous violence).  They claim they didn't know anything about the smut until they saw the finished film.  So, the name Roger Corman meant nothing to them?  Did they not know whom they were working for?  Supposedly, the actress most outraged by this unexpected development was Ann Turkel who played Dr. Susan Drake (a marginal character at best).  It could explain why her character always seemed a bit miffed and putout by what was going on.  She was almost a famous actress (how humiliating to lower her standards by default).  I love this movie in spite of her protests and her demand that her name be stricken from the credits.  Ann who?

It's a fun film, not very accomplished in the way it was made, but all the right ingredients are there so it works on a level not to be confused with high art.  Every brother and his dog dies.  Breasts are exposed, frequently.  There are fiery explosions.  Oodles of monsters (although only three suits were made, they managed to make it seem like an army of monsters was on the rampage).  Dopey dialog delivered with a severe lack of acumen.  It's practically a masterpiece!  It's one of my all time favorites!!!",1443052800,4,1558,4.7677902621722845

814189,5,6304238142,"I can remember when I watched this for the first time on cable TV back in the '80s.  I loved it and still do! If you grew up in the age of the ""animal kingdom gone wild"" theme of the late '70s to early '80s as I did, you will enjoy this one. Roger Corman does a good job and comes up with a campy sea creature not like anything we have seen before. When a sleepy fishing village comes into contact with several ""humanoids"", they don't know what to make of it at first. Accidents happen and a few citizens begin to disappear. The fishermen and town sheriff are baffled, until a woman scientist comes to town with her own theory. The native Indian residents want the fishing rights restored and don't want a new cannery coming in to make matters worse. The local men do want the cannery and most of the citizens agree, saying it will bring jobs to Noyo. However, the scientists have tampered with the DNA of local fish and that only means trouble for the entire town as they are forced to deal with a potential and grave threat to their very survival.
The yearly salmon carnival at the end of the movie is one carnival the creatures will make sure their presence is finally known to all.

This edition is wonderful! This is the International Uncut version, not the American version released on DVD in 1999. I believe it is somewhat more graphic, especially that of a man that is attacked at the carnival and has his head literally torn off from one of the humanoids. Looks pretty good even for today's standards and back then, there was no CGI. Everything was models, masks, and makeup.
The Menu is well done with music from the movie in the background and film footage clips, ""Humanoids From the Deep"" graphic in yellow on top center with selections ""Play"" ""Chapters"" ""Bonus"" underneath. The woman laying on the beach with the Red bikini is on the menu as well.

Supposedly Roger Corman was the un-credited executive producer, and now they're using his name to promote it. Well, like anytime when I have a bad cold, I plopped onto the couch and put on some random B-Horror flicks. Although I prefer 1950s creature features and ambient ghostly themes, this one is from 1980 and was a real treat.

The rape scenes are not as harsh as they sound, there are only like two, and it's somewhat dubious what's exactly taking place. Other sequences of attacking humanoids are terrifyingly whimsical. It's all ridiculous fun, you guys. It pushes the envelope in a goofy way, as all classic B-Horrors do.

The film is well directed by Barbara Peeters though Corman felt the film lacked the more exploitative elements needed to sell it and brought in James Sbardellati to direct the more graphic scenes of sex, nudity and gore to be added in. Peeters was apparently very unhappy with the changes Corman made, as was star Ann Turkel who plays scientist Dr. Susan Drake, who created the creatures and now seeks to help destroy them. And as for the cast a cast lead by Doug McClure (as fisherman Jim Hill) and Vic Morrow (as rival fisherman and town jerk, Hank Slattery) they treat the material with the respect it deserves and that adds weight despite its far fetched story. Despite the artistic differences between Corman and his director, the film is bloody good time and loaded with all the fun characteristics we expect from a Roger Corman movie and thats what counts. Also characteristic of a Roger Corman film, future talents are present behind the scenes. Here it is makeup FX legend Rob Bottin providing creatures and plentiful gore and, one of todays top composers, James Horner.

814490,4,6304238142,"BOTTOM LINE: If you love 80's horror and/or are a fan of monster movies, (especially the 'man-in-suit' variety), then this film belongs in your collection. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Slimy aquamaniac whatchamacallits from the murky ocean depths surface in order to scrounge up some human babes to mate with because: 1) their pollution-threatened population is dwindling; 2) they're kinda horny; and 3) why the hell not?

THOUGHTS: This film is not for everyone, especially young kids. There's quite a bit of gore and the story contains some unpleasant scenarios. Bonered-up fishmen raping beach babes isn't exactly your standard kid-friendly fare. The low budget makes the goings-on more ghastly than you might otherwise find in more mainstream films. (After all, this was a Roger Corman-produced flick.) This forced the filmmakers to be creative to achieve their vision and, IMHO, the resulting F/X stuff is generally pretty decent. I'm a big Doug McClure fan also, so his inclusion is a bonus. Film is played straight and despite the absurd plot, it comes across fairly honest and believable (on its own terms). Be aware that the ending is a one of modern horror's truly legendary gross-out, showstopping shockers... so don't say you weren't warned! LOL.

THE DVD: Shout! Factory's home video presentation of HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP is a solid effort. Audio portion is level & strong and the picture is clean & crisp. This is especially apparent during the mass night attack scene. Lots of fan-pleasing bonus features up the value of this release, including a newly-shot on-camera interview with producer Roger Corman, a ""Making of"" featurette and some vintage tidbits.",1388102400,2,1664,5.178438661710037

814495,4,6304238142,"Humanoids... is a pleasingly gory creature feature from Roger Corman's studio. It was directed by a woman Barbara Peeters, but had additional footage inserted from a second unit shoot because Corman felt that Peeters' cut did not have the requisite sexploitation content he had mandated (the evil creatures here rape and impregnate naked / semi-naked local women). This is alluded to in the making of docu where a distinct element of embarrassment hovers over most of the crew as they discuss the changes made by Corman to Peeters' film (she herself is not seen here). That said, the film is a lot more distinctive on account of its exploitative elements.

Shout Factory's 16:9 transfer (again for me a revelation from the 4:3 cropped version I'd seen as a kid) wonderfully recreates the look of the film. It's on the softer side, but lush and colorful, and the grain pattern is not tampered with. The LPCM 2.0 track faithfully presents the original mix of the film. The aforementioned making of is quite interesting with a lot of input from crew members like composer James Horner and editor Michael Goldblatt who went on to more prestigious jobs.",1382918400,,1148,4.887179487179488

Now lets dive into this incredible monster flick.

Story: Due to the Company CanCo releasing growth hormones into Salmon. The hormones cause mutations in the Salmon they capture and so the Salmon when eaten by larger fish cause the larger fish to mutate into oversize humanoid beasts. The creatures view man as a competitor and have begun to rape human women so their new species can live on. The creatures have super strength, thrive on land, and in water. The fish have become amphibious very much like Salamanders or Newts. It's up to Jim Hill and Dr. Susan Drake to stop the creatures' monstrous rampage.

Right before the shock ending there is a shot of the destruction the creatures have caused and it adds a dark almost sad tone to the film. I don't know the shot just has an affect on the viewer.

The Good: Great gore effects, nice practical effects, great acting, great cinematography, nice pace, fantastic score, unique story, good writing, good dialogue, and fantastic directing.

The Bad: Dialogue and acting at times is a little cheesy.

Fun Facts: Originally the film was meant to be a take on the Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). This is Roger Corman's 3rd sea monster film, his first was Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961), his 2nd was Up from the Depths (1979), and his fourth is Demon of Paradise (1987). James Horner does the score which is magnificent. Humanoids from the Deep has an alternate title called Monster which appears  at the title on the title screen. Joe Dante was originally given the project but he turned it down, Barbara Peeters accepted the project. James Sbarbdellati became the second unit director and filmed all of the sex, nudity, rape, and gore scenes. James Sbarbdellati would go on to direct Deathstalker. Which those shots Roger Corman edited without Barbra Peeters' knowing at the last minute to spice up the picture. Rob Bottin (pronounced boot-een) did the special effects for  the film and in 1980 did the effects for Joe Dantes' The Howling, and in 1982 Rob Bottin did the effects for John Capenter's The Thing. There was only 3 monster suits and one baby creature puppet, which the effect of there being more than 3 and in fact a whole army is pulled off quite well. Roger Corman did a made for TV film remake of this film in 1996 starring David Carradine and Emma Samms. The remake lacks nudity (which is fine) but lacks the gore and monster action of the original. Roger knew the remake was awful because he took footage from this film (the original) and put it into the film. The remake is very dull, very slow paced, and just bad. Its sad that David Carradine stars in it because he couldn't even save the film. Take my word for it the remake is BAD! The remake marks low sad point in David Carradine's career. The filming for Humanoids from the Deep (1980) began in 1970. In the Japanese release there was a scene edited in of a head being decapitated. Film dips into both the horror, sc-fi, and exploitation genres. The film also deals with racism. Film is apart of Shout! Factory's Roger Corman's Cult Classics.

A note from me: I really love the creatures they are kinda goofy but I like em'. I also like the score by James Horner. The film has lots of gore, nudity, explosions, and ma-ma-ma-ma monster rape. It is a Joe Bob Briggs style monster movie (TNT's monstervision reference) featuring, blood, babes, and beasts.

Verdict: In the words of Joe Bob Briggs check it out. I give the film 5/5 stars and the DVD 5/5 stars.

Thank you Shout!/Scream! Factory for these fantastic DVDS but where is The Nest (1988)?

All in all a gross movie that was only provided small interest that led me to re-find how Vic Morrow died so young - if you remember it was on a set of a Vietnam War flic where a helicopter crashed and literally decapitated Morrow and a young child he was carrying in the scene. Anyway, with that bit of sad movie trivia out of the way, it had no other redeeming qualities IMO. Oh, it also starred Doug McClure who also passed away young, like Morrow, but of a more mundane cause.

814560,1,6304238142,"It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen -- but it is SO bad that it's really quite amusing (if accompanied by some mild intoxication, anyway). Bad acting, bad direction, bad editing, and bad 80s hairdos to top it all off.

Best question to ask of this movie: Why do the monsters kill human males, but rape human females? Shouldn't they find human females just as repulsive as humans find THEM? What on earth would compel them to WANT to rape human females?

Answer: Because the sickos who created this movie thought it was entertaining to have grotesque monsters rip the clothing off attractive women and then paw at them. That's why this movie spends almost as much time showing boobs as it does showing the monsters.

As I said, it's so stupid it's almost funny. If you can watch it for free, get some beer and have yourself a laugh. But don't watch it sober, or you'll just hate yourself -- and for God's sake, don't PAY to watch this. It ain't worth it.",1371168000,,961,4.448863636363637

814657,4,6304238142,"In a way, Jaws created a genre. It established a kind of visual and structural template. And this movie, to an extent, follows it. On the other hand, Roger Corman was shooting monsters coming out of the water when Stevie Spielberg was a wee lad geeking out at the cinema. These Humanoids... They'll come after you, whether you're near the water or not. They'll choke you. Bludgeon you. Bite you. Rape you. But, worst of all, they will get in your trash. Fortunately, the way to stop them is no great mystery. You just shoot them a lot. Of note: The party in the film's small town made me feel more sorry for the citizens than the monster attacks did. This despite a neck-break performance by the elderly outfit known as the Whitewater Boys. Also of note: There's a toddler in a few scenes that is always legitimately upset, and may have been scarred for life. Favorite scene? At the big Salmon Festival, a local radio deejay, Mad Man Mike Michaels is broadcasting live and interviewing ""Miss Salmon."" (You read that right.) His lines include: ""Come on out, folks.

814661,4,6304238142,"Humanoids of the Deep (1979) features strange mutated creatures from the ocean, who come ashore and aggressively attack and kill, while seeking to procreate with women.  Also going by the rather generic title ""Monsters"", the film bears some basic similarities to classic 1950 science fiction, with actors dressed in rubber monster suits.  With Roger Corman as executive producer, the plot unfolds in textbook fashion for a creature feature, as the people of a small seaside fishing town, unexpectedly find themselves under attack.  Humanoids of the Deep is distinguished by a number of strong action sequences, and provocative scenes featuring women being ravaged by the creepy creatures.

There may not be a great deal of originality to the plot, but the finished product is pretty entertaining B-move fare.  Although the residents are divided about supporting plans for building a canning plant in the town, everyone pulls together to battle the marauding creatures, when they mount a mass assault during a celebration, and plenty of violence and gore ensues.

Roger Corman wanted more exploitative elements in the movie, so second unit director James Sbardellati shot additional action and nude scenes, which were then incorporated into the final version of the film which features Vic Morrow, Doug McClure, Ann Turkel, and Lynn Shiller.

The basic story is that a new cannery in town seems to be dumping chemicals into the water to facilitate faster fish growth. It works, but unfortunately it works a bit too well, as it's created an army of Creature From the Black Lagoon knock-offs that are intent on raping and killing the towns population.

Yes, the story is goofy, while the F/X are pretty solid for a B-movie, this flick is as corny as they come. Tons of blood, gratuitous nudity, monsters, cheezy dialogue...in short, the perfect movie for a late night weekend showing.

Funny how these people disapear from the town at the same time as the film crew), and even the evil corporate developer. If there were any Japanese there would have been a giant robot and ninjas in school girl outfits!
But enough of my private life. This movie is about a small town on the water that gets attacked by a school of fishmen who have to impregnate human women to survive. A few people (and dogs) get killed and the obligatory teenage couples get killed (boys) or worse (girls) before the inevetable massed attack on the town fair. The difference with this movie is that after the initial shock and a few deaths/rapes the locals realise that the fish men may have the arms of orangutans and the teeth of sharks, they also had the agility of wombats. Crowds of locals armed with rifles and bits of wood make short work of the bipedal sushi.
One of the girls impregnated even has a ""John Hurt moment"".

It is drawn from a European print of the film and carries the title ""Monster,"" but it is the same ""Humanoids from the Deep"" you likely remember fondly. This has no relation to the terrible, utterly pointless re-edit that was done in 1996.

The soundtrack is remastered as well as can be expected, with decent ranges in a home theater setting, but do not expect something along the lines of Iron Man. This is a low budget oldie, and only so much restoration can be effectively done. It has its weaknesses, but as a whole was still very enjoyable and pure nostalgic fun. It is worth the cost. This version is unedited, and there is at least one instance where a brief added scene was cut in some versions for obvious reasons. . .but overall this is the best version and copy of this film I have ever seen.  Oh, and this has Doug McClure in it. . .remember him?  Really, what more can you ask for?

814846,5,6304238142,"Humanoids from the Deep tasked writers with what would happen if the Creature from the Black Lagoon had procreated with a manatee and released its humanoid, tailed, ichthyoid and evidently all-male children off the coast of some north-Pacific American fishing town.  The answer?  They would capture and rape as many young women as possible--leaving many dead and sequestering some in case they desired seconds.  That's basically the story of this movie.  Well, they tried to sell a little side plot about a cannery (for canned fish) that was threatening the livelihood of local Native Americans, but would help the local white fishermen.  Not very interesting.  But I guess the writers thought that a flat-out fish-man rape/snuff film would be a bit much all alone.

 Our ""let's investigate""-minded protagonists discover the breeding ground and lair of these creatures.  They clearly never played a zombie FPS because they're aiming their shotguns for body shots and the creatures' heads have over-sized exposed brains.  Really, guys?  How did you miss that?  While they fumble about trying to eradicate these abominations we learn that the somewhat-attractive, 6-foot blonde, marine biologist (Ann Turkel of Deep Space (1988)) accompanying them seems far too knowledgeable about this allegedly unknown species.  It turns out that her super-funded company was responsible for accidently creating these awful mutant, hyper-evolved sardinious killers.  Who'd of thought that a big company would be responsible for such horror (Alien's Weyland Industries; Resident Evil's Umbrella Corporation; Jurassic Park's InGen; Terminator's SkyNet)?

 The action in this flick is bad.  Like, really bad.  But that makes it no different from any other Roger Corman classic, right?  So, it really poses no major problem or flaw for the genre.  The acting is bad, but--come on!  What did we expect from early 80s horror?  The effects are just serviceable and attempts at gore are satisfactory, though less common than I'd prefer until the end, which is gore-rich.  This hits its high point when the annual Salmon Festival is going on and they have to try to get the locals to buy this line of bull.

 This movie is delightfully awful and adorably inconsistent.  Three shotgun rounds to the chest and these monsters may keep coming at you.  But use a bottle of drain cleaner, a two-by-four, or put a steak knife in the hands of a scared housewife and these amphibious aberrations fall apart as if one were attacking a bowl of organ pudding.  They seem MUCH more strong and dangerous when facing a star protagonist than, say, a woman, child, or horrified teen.  And, perhaps to convey the ""rapid evolutionary rate"" of these mutants, some have awkward triple-length forearms.  If you have an Intro to Biology background, you'll find some intriguingly obvious holes in the writers' concept of genetics and evolution.  After all, something with salmon and frog DNA can evolve ""in its own lifetime"" and should be able to mate with humans, right?  That makes sense!

 Our heroes' coup de grace comes when they light a 50x100' area of water surface on fire with gasoline.  Somehow this helps the festival attendees to successfully thwart this brood of gilled villains.  Of course!  Because if I was a fish-man I'd become physically weaker if within ten yards of fire and, were I under water, I'd surely surface, catch fire, and remain at the surface so that I could burn to death slowly.  REALLY?

 The ending is predictable, but B-horror-wonderful!  Mine are the rantings and ravings of a very pleased horror enthusiast.  If you love horror and have yet to see this classic--stop what you're doing, hop onto Netflix, sit down and enjoy!

If you like other trashy, exploitative Roger Corman classics, you'll probably love this.  As much effort was placed on campy as gory, and boy does that mean it's going to be fun.  For an 80s B-horror, I give this a B+ for ludicrous entertainment value.  Loved it!  IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE, WATCH:  Contamination (1980), Inseminoid (1982), Deep Space (1988, which features our lead actress) and Galaxy of Terror (1981).  Also try Piranha (1978) and sequel.  For a more modern flick with a similar plot, you can't go wrong or without laughing if you watch Piranha 3D (2010) and, of course, the upcoming sequel Piranha 3DD.",1332115200,,4333,5.0508474576271185

But, I was disappointed when I finally got the DVD home.  Several of the scenes in the film are ultra grainy, while most of it looks perfect.  A small footnote in the insert says this happened because they used the European print and the scenes would have been blurry if they had been cleaned up.  It can't believe with today's technology that these scenes couldn't have been cleaned up, if even just a little.  The DVD also says that it is the first time the uncut version has been made available in America.  However, I watched my VHS tape of Humanoids right after this DVD and found nothing new in it.  But, my biggest complaint would have to be the sound.  The DVD makers kept the film in a 2.0 mix.  Which is fine, except that for most of the movie, I had to turn the volume up and down because the dialogue kept fading out.  My VHS tape didn't have this problem so I am not sure if this is a problem with the print used or a problem with the transfer to DVD itself.  Overall, the DVD is worth it as long as it stays at a price around $10.00.  Anything more than that and the buyer is not getting their money's worth.",1310169600,,1281,4.154471544715447

Sleazy and gruesome 1980 Sci-fi horror exploitation shocker from New World Pictures and Roger Corman is one of their biggest hits yet.

There's sexy nude girls with a few icky scenes of rape done by monsters and gore abound which nearly got an X-Rating, laughable acting, excellent make-up and monsters by Rob Bottin, a terrific score by James Horner as this is his debut score and of course a bizarre ending that will remind you of Alien.

814965,3,6304238142,"Another Roger Corman Classic has made it to DVD courtesy of Shout Factory. This film had been released before but this is the first time it is fully intact with no cuts or censorship. The ""Humanoids From The Deep"" (AKA ""Monster"" in other countries) concerns another scientific experiment gone wrong creating reptilian type underwater/land breathing ""Humanoids"" that emerge from the ocean to attack and kill men and rape the women to propagate their species. The film stars Doug McClure and Ann Turkel and Vic Morrow. Ann Turkel is the scientist whose experiment has gone wrong. The creatures were designed by Academy Award winning Special Effects Master (Who created all the mutated creatures in John Carpenter's nightmare version of ""The Thing"") Rob Bottin. The film directed by Barbara Peters (who claims Corman didn't think the film was 'shocking' enough and added more scenes) has created a film that shows what was only discussed in other films, salmon-esque mutated monsters raping women on film. The ending is a shocker when the 'babies' are born. If you like Corman's exploitation films, you'll enjoy this one. Be warned that this film is not for kids as it contains scenes of creature/woman rape, nudity and the shocking ending. This is one of Corman' films that Shout Factory has released recently. They also did ""Piranha"" (which has a remake coming out this summer), David Carradine in ""Deathrace 2000' (recently remade by Paul Anderson), ""Galaxy of Terror"" with it's 'all-star' cast before they were big stars. also un-cut (and my favorite horror movie) and ""Forbidden World"" (another creature in space horror film) and several more films released only weeks apart.

As everybody in the free world knows, the mutant fishmen in this film attack a fishing town called Noyo coz they want to reproduce(Noyo must be located upstream).  They attack from the water, slaughtering the men and getting down to slimy business with the chicks in the sand in a kind of Corman version of From Here To Eternity.  Strangely, the humanoids never seem to attack ugly women, and though they kinda clumsily shuffle along, they always manage to catch the women.  No one knows what's causing the strange deaths and attacks at first, but leave it to ol' Doug McClure to smell something fishy going on.  With the help of a Native American fisherman(who's been branded the murderer by the town bigot, Vic Morrow) and a female scientist(who's partly responsible for these humanoids but never really owns up to it) McClure figures out what's REALLY going on, but soon the humanoids are launching a full out assault on the annual Salmon Festival.  Fish, sex and violence run rampant!
Not the most politically correct of films, but there's no reason in the world it should be.  It's good ol' creature feature fun the way we like it done.  Once again Corman makes great use of his tiny budget.  The humanoid costumes by Rob Bottin are great.  The documentary on this new DVD tells how director Barbara Peeters wasn't too pleased with the outcome of this film(didn't she know what kind of movie she was doing?), as she wanted a much tamer film, and Corman hired a second director to shoot some of the more juicy scenes.  Corman also lured in actors under a different film title coz he knew no one would want to audition for a film called Humanoids From The Deep!
The film on this DVD is the International version known as ""Monster"", and has a few extra snippets of gore.  Yet another Corman hit from the Shout Factory.  Keep em coming!",1281744000,4,2032,4.661064425770308

If you're looking for a twisted combination of gore, nudity, and cheese, it doesn't get much better than this. Humanoids From the Deep kicks the '80s off in fine fashion, with enough touches of '70s exploitation and '50s monster madness inserted to make this essential viewing for the cult horror fan.

Some fiendish/foolish scientists get to tinkering with mother nature in the lab, attempting to alter the genetics of the salmon in the small fishing village of Noyo. Bad idea docs...mo fish, mo problems. I'm talking major Salmonella sickness. The end result is a horde of horny fish monsters raping and pillaging the town in chaotic gory splendor.

This film is just good sick fun. I honestly believe every horror film needs a beautifully big-breasted chick running across the beach. Plus the gore effects and costumes here are simply great. If the idea of grotesque water monsters mounting hot naked chicks is potentially offensive to you, you might wanna skip this one. The sexual conquests are more than just implied here, although not nearly as graphic as say a Joe D'Amato film. This Corman classic also has a nice touch of humor and cheesiness to balance it out.

815044,5,6304238142,"It's tough to believe that ""Humanoids From the Deep"" isn't more of a cult item. After having heard about it for years but not caring to shell out big bucks for the out of print DVD I finally caught it on IFC and was pretty much blown away. Few films display such a goofy, straight faced audacity, and while it loses some impact on repeated viewing there still isn't a lot out there quite like it. It's a little on the slow side, I'll admit, but damn does it deliver in the end and has just enough spice through the early going to keep you watching. Mandatory viewing for all horror buffs.

Normally I'd delve a bit into plot and character and so forth, but I'll keep that to a minimum. Suffice it to say that in a small Northwestern town they've been screwing with nature and now there're some nasty salmon-men with an insatiable lust for human females. (The humanoids also kill people too, pretty much just for the hell of it.) There's also a bit of ""Jaws"" style conspiracy and some pro-Indian material to bolster the film's environmentalist credentials, but none of this matters much. (It does seem to take the faintly superstitious environmentalist message more seriously than most of your ""revenge of nature"" flicks, though this ain't saying much as most of them clearly didn't give a damn about such stuff.) More important than the specific plot is the rather pieced together nature of the film. As has been documented extensively and is rather obvious from merely watching the film, Roger Corman and New World Productions re-worked it somewhat after director Barbara Peeters finished the major shooting. Thus we have a peculiar mix of Peeters' silly but still self-serious eco-horror pic and Corman and second unit director James Sbardellati's more teen- and sex-oriented exploitation horror. These elements actually play off one another very well, with the spontaneous and random scenes of grue and nudity being all the more striking and amusing in contrast to the sometimes unrelated narrative. And when it all comes together in the orgy of violence at the film's climax, well, it's quite the sight. (And the coda, which most of you probably already know about but which I will not reveal, is deliriously ridiculous/derivative. It contains quite possible the least convincing hand puppet in all of film.)

Most significant, however, are the monsters themselves. They're an early effort from FX genius Rob Bottin and while philistines will complain that they aren't convincing (such people have no concept of art), they represent a trio of the most endearing rubber suit monsters ever to grace the screen. (We've got one basic monster, one with a tail and one with extra long arms.) Considering the limited budget they are quite impressively detailed, some of the slimiest, bumpiest fish monsters ever conceived. The choreography and motion of the monsters is somewhat more limited (they mostly just kinda bear hug their victims to death), but the suits themselves are good enough to compensate for such limitations. And as for the most controversial element, i.e. the monsters raping of mostly naked women, well, this is absolutely hilarious. The humor doesn't have a lot to do with rape per se, but rather the stunning effect of presenting this taboo event in such an absurd manner. I could go on about why being deeply offended by such a display makes you an uptight moron, but those who believe this are pretty impervious logic, so what's the point? (Reasoning is highly phallic and the Goddess doesn't approve it in the least, don't ya know?) Anyway, the film came out 30 years ago, so the massive cultural damage it generated via the depiction of rubber-suited men grinding against scantily clad females has already occurred. All we can do is pick up the pieces and try to restore the shattered lives.

Anyway, though the exploitation elements are key, the other angles are better than you might think. The acting isn't too bad (though lead Ann Turkel sometimes mangles her oft ludicrous dialogue) and Peeters' direction is competent if somewhat flat, at least until the final massacre. The film runs a scant 77 or so minutes minus the credits, so you don't have enough time to get bogged down in the surrounding material even if it, again, doesn't totally come alive until the last act. There's enough blood and monsters and molesting in those last 20 minutes for a half dozen mediocre exploitation films, however, and that's what really counts.

Finally, this new Shout Factory DVD seems to be of pretty high quality. It's extended ever so slightly (though the added decapitation is pretty unimpressive) and looks pretty decent for such an old and cheap film. I dunno how it matches up to the older versions, but they aren't readily available now anyway.

Again, an exploitation horror classic. Not to be missed.

having seen this movie in the theater back during the Summer of 1980.  It was one cheesey movie.  It's not a great movie, however, it's one of those 'guilty pleasure' movies.  I believe it was also shown on 'Joe Bob Brigg's Drive-In theater' show on
TMC several years later. This movie made me laugh.  What can I say, it was one funny 'horror' picture.  I don't know if they did it for the this blu-ray release, however, I
think it would be great if they had Joe Bob Briggs do the commentaries in the 'Special Features' section of the blu-ray disk.  I think Roger Corman remade this movie later in the mid 1990s, unfortunately, I never saw the remake.  We can hope he will release that movie soon as well.",1279584000,,789,4.393103448275862
815046,4,6304238142,"Humanoids From the Deep: Movie Review

Grade: B+

Ah, Roger Corman. Giver of other creature-features like Carnosaur, Creature From the Haunted Sea, Beast From Haunted Cave, and The Wasp Woman. You can't help but respect all the work he's put in over the years--and Humanoids From the Deep is him at his schlocky best.

Noyo is a dying town. Filled with people who sit at bars and argue over the cannery coming to town (nobody really seems to work) the only thing good coming up for them is the annual Salmon Fest. This year's festival is shaping up to be pretty fun---if it weren't for the horribly mutated humanoids heading their way. You see, scientists at the cannery have been trying to speed up growth in the salmon, but instead coelacanths eat a bunch of treated fish and turn into freaky, large-brained, (yet incredibly one-minded and dumb) monsters. From the deep. Yeah, it doesn't make much sense to me either.

But if you're watching a movie with a title like ""Humanoids From the Deep"" in the first place, why would you want it to be smart? It's obviously not, and even the scientists in the movie say the dumbest lines.

Take this one for example: ""These creatures are driven to mate with man now, in order to further develop their incredible evolution."" A scientist said that? Really?

That brings us to the movie's main fault: its way too serious. For a movie like this, the actors line are all dead pan and grim. That does mean that there are times when Humanoids actually manages to become...well, actually creepy and atmospheric, but those moments come few and far between. By the time we're at the festival climax, you'll be laughing at the ridiculousness of the attacks. (Who knew humanoids were so flammable?)

Yet underneath all of the scientific lectures and social commentary the movie offers, (Don't. Mess. With. Nature. Or it'll send salmon mutants to mate with your daughters.) the movie is a creature feature at heart---filled with random gory attacks and costumed actors ripping people apart. There's no CGI here folks, only good ol' fashioned practical effects. Corman manages to add in a couple explosions too; it just goes to show that the film is really meant to be purely entertaining. And it mostly succeeds at that, something SyFy creature features of late can't even begin to compare with.

Note: A new DVD release is scheduled to come out on August 3rd. This is great news, especially since it's selling for extremely high prices everywhere I look. Trust me--the movie's good, but it's not worth paying those prices.",1275955200,,2552,4.810502283105023
815047,4,6304238142,"Sweet Jeebus! Here it comes again! The triumphant return of the original 1980 classic: ""Humanoids from the Deep"".
I am placing my order, now that it is getting a fitting transfer to Blu Ray! A sleepy fishing village is the next rung on the evolutionary ladder for an entirely new species: humanoids! They are an off-shoot by-product of man's arrogance in developing a formula to make fish (in this case salmon) larger & more plentiful. It back-fires as the mutated fry somehow evolve into horny sea monsters with an insatiable appetite to get laid! Doug McClure plays Jim Hill, the local harbor master. He and visiting scientist Dr. Susan Drake (the lovely Ann Turkel)must discover the cause of the commotion as these sea-devils are about to make their bid at taking over the local fish festival!
This was one of veteran actor Vic Morrow's final roles before his accidental death on the set of ""The Twilight Zone"" movie in 1982. Word has it that this films director, Barbara Peeters was appalled by the intense scenes of rape against women, which were shot by a second unit director and inserted at the insistence of producer Roger Corman. How can you fault him? Hey, he knows his audience.  Also noteworthy for a great early scoring by James Horner, who went on to do the film scores for ""Star Trek II:the wrath of Khan"" and ""The Perfect Storm"". ***Update!*** The Blu Ray transfer is simply stunning! Of note, that this is the International version, so the title is MONSTER (in small print ""Humanoids from the Deep""). It includes many longer and extended shots of gore all pretty much at the end. I love the deleted scenes (some without audio)! Many are chock full of boobies! Nice!

815049,5,6304238142,"This review is for the 2010 DVD version of Humanoids from the Deep. The original version and NOT the remake..
Shout Factory has acquired the rights to releasing New Horizons Roger Corman library & has announced many new titles to be released for the first time or in this case re-released but with a twist. This will be a vast improvement over previous releases. What you will get on the DVD or the BluRay are the following

* New high-definition transfer of the Uncut international version presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1)
* Never-before-seen deleted scenes
* Trailer, TV and radio spots
* Leonard Maltin's interviews with Roger Corman on the making of the film
* ""The Making of Humanoids From The Deep,"" featuring new interviews with composer James Horner, second unit/assistant director James Sbardellati, editor Mark Goldblatt and more!
* New World trailers
Being released uncut, the DVD will be just like the DVD version that was released in Japan which is (maybe now was ) very sought after. The uncut scene is a head ripping off scene at the dock toward the end of the movie.
The movie itself is about mutant man-sized killer salmon that wreck havoc on humanity. The late Doug McClure is the hero..
This is not a spoiler but this movie contains some graphic gory violence as well as brief shots / flash cuts of the monsters mating (raping actually) with females. Yes, its pretty gory and contains nudity. For these reasons this movie is not for young kids. This movie isn't a scary horror ala Halloween or Friday the 13th - but it is an action packed in your face man size monster brutal horror movie. The monsters are human sized & slice and dice a lot of people. I have seen this film many times and it still packs a jolt. It is the closest thing we have to a modern day Creature from the Black Lagoon or a Monster of Piedras Blancas, but these creatures are shown doing what those monsters would do off-screen. A very well made B movie made by one of the best in the business - Roger Corman
The deleted scenes in this are really amazing and fantastic..I feel they should have been in the film. Some of the scenes have no sound. There is also a very well written linear notes by Michael Felsher , President of Red Shirt Pictures, talking about this film with some cool background information.
The DVD itself has a reversible cover as do many of Shouts Corman releases. The other cover as well as the disc is the sleeve art for the Japanese DVD of Humanoids. In fact the transfer used is under the title ""Monster"" not Humanoids actually.
I do highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it before. I HIGHLY recommend getting this version of the DVD. There is no more need to spend $50.00 for a full screen bare bones release with this widescreen uncut DVD on the Horizon..
More Roger Corman titles are coming out ..

815101,3,6304238142,"Noticeably taking several cues from big budget horror films, Humanoids from the Deep still manages to create an enjoyable atmosphere and a few unique thrills to retain an air of originality. Combining an infinitely absurd plot with serious actors, decent gore effects, gratuitous nudity, and a pervasive foreboding score from James Horner culminates in a low budget horror flick that nearly breaks free of such impediments to offer plenty of scares and laughs, mostly in that order.

In this Roger Corman produced monster movie, a small coastal village finds themselves facing a deadly invasion when DNA testing on local sea life causes mutated amphibious monstrosities to rise from the waters and begin preying on the villagers - and attempting to mate with human women.

With their large, exposed brains and slimy green bodies, the designs for the ""Humanoids"" look like a cross between Swamp Thing and the extraterrestrials from This Island Earth. Knowing the limitations of their budget and creature effects, the filmmakers wisely chose to keep the beasts shrouded in darkness, and until about halfway through we never see the entire mutant. As legendary B-movie producer Roger Corman himself stated, the true monster will likely never live up to what the audience creates in their own minds, and here such words of wisdom certainly apply as the Humanoids' shambling long-armed awkwardness and fishy faces lessens the horror and amplifies the silliness. But in the end this is a B-movie, so the ""people in rubber suits"" creatures are expected and the amount of destruction and mayhem they cause is actually rather impressive.

In an interview with film historian Leonard Maltin, Corman admitted that he felt a sense of humor is very important in horror films - especially if you don't want audiences laughing in the wrong places. One of the major shortcomings with Humanoids from the Deep is that there are no obvious moments of humor - the laughs arise from clich character stupidities and overly witless dialogue. In fact, most often the funniest moments are meant to be the scariest. This makes Humanoids from the Deep an effective schlock horror film, but by no means demonstrates the level of purposeful humor that Corman insists he instilled.

As a throwback to the science-fiction monster movies of the 50's, Humanoids does offer bloodthirsty fans the opportunity to enjoy the entertaining cheesiness with an added dose of violence, gore and nudity. Many scenes of nubile young vixens getting their clothes torn off appear to be added just for the sake of more nakedness, which of course is a greatly appreciated fundamental aspect of B-movie bliss.

815104,1,6304238142,"Humanoids from the Deep (Barbara Peters, 1980)

Perhaps the worst insult I can pay a film, from my own experience, is my not remembering I'd seen it before until I'm at least halfway through the movie. It's usually the oddest things that make me remember I've seen a film before. In this case, it was Anothony Pena's entirely innocuous ""I've caught a bunch of steelhead I need help eating, wanna come?"" line. From there, the deja vu came thick and fast. When the dock collapsed, I knew I'd seen it before and forgotten it entirely. How did I forget it? Easy-- it's completely forgettable.

The story: Noyo, California, lives and dies by its salmon industry. In order to revitalize the town, CanCo, who are planning in opening a cannery in town, have hired a doctor, Susan Drake (Ann Turkel, perhaps better known for being Richard Harris' ex-wife than for any of her film work) to work on a growth hormone to help the salmon reproduce and reach maturity faster. Well, you know the rest, it's standard ecohorror fare, with a Corman twist: the sea monsters feel driven to mate with humans, allowing for much gratuitous nudity in the great Roger Corman tradition. (Peters, who never directed another feature film after this, reportedly refused to shoot the nude scenes, so Corman brought in another director-- Jimmy Murakami, who would later go on to well-deserved fame as the co-director, with Melinda Gebbie, of Where the Wind Blows.)

Unfortunately, the nudity is pretty much the only reason to watch this. The script, basically a one-off collaboration by folks who never did much in Hollywood, is predictable and silly, while the cast is made up of B-grade actors (Turkel shares top billing with second-feature stalwarts Doug McClure and Vic Morrow) delivering even less than their usual verve. Peters' direction shows that she grew up at Corman's foot (her entire feature film career consisted of work in the Corman stable), never rising above the level of cheap exploitation fare. The special effects are about as special as my education. In short, why bother? *",1203292800,3,2064,4.908309455587393

815107,4,6304238142,"Humanoids From The Deep was released during the age of gore (1978-1983) in 1980. Incredible film transfer picture is sharp and crisp, audio is loud and clear. An interview with Roger Corman done by Leonard Maltin is really a nice feature on this dvd release. There are also a few other trailers from other Roger Corman movies on this dvd, along with talent bios. Roger Corman really struck a cord with gore fans with Humanoids. Humanoids is 80 minutes just like the old 1950s sci-fi movies. Barbara Peters does an excellent job directing this movie. Vic Morrow plays Hank Slattery so well that I could really believe this hank charachter existed. Doug Mcclure plays the calm and steady Jim Hill. Ann Turkell a believable scientist. All the other lesser known actors really fused the script and the story of Humanoids really well. A young Rob Bottin does an awesome job in the special effects of the mutated Humanoids, Rob Bottins effects work was done for the production of Humanoids in 1979, way before computer animation. I think the effects were quite believable even then in 1980 and even today. The Humanoids are a really believable monster, long teeth, long sharp claws. I could have done without their screeching and wailing but I think it fit the Humanoids perfect. Excellently written story by Frank Arnold and Martin B.Cohen. The ending to Humanoids was shocking for its time, but really quite common as with gore movies at this time (1978-1983). Directors and writers of this film genre were always trying to shock film audiences with gory effects during this time in the film industry. Keep in mind Humanoids came out during the age of gore but also before the MPAA got involved in controlling content in motion pictures. Horror gore movies like Humanoids From The Deep got away with alot of really gory effects. This movie should, I hope will keep your interest, the thing I like about Humanoids is the black humor, black humor aside, viewing the end of Humanoids from the deep will leave you thinking ""what if this really happened?"". If you have 80 minutes to spare on something wild watch Humanoids From The Deep there is lots of gore and an  awesome classical soundtrack by a young James Horner, great Rob Bottin monster effects, political issues about over land  development, and by the way a few georgeous ladies to ad to this shlock fest.",1156291200,5,2357,4.802955665024631

Spending my time next to a gas burner to keep us warm at 3:30 in the morning waiting for the next shot. i have great memories of us extras dining with Doug, Vic, Anthony, Ann, Barbra. The movie was campy fun and a definite B movie of desperate measure.",1133049600,8,502,4.03
815109,3,6304238142,"Doug McClure established himself as Trampas on tv's ""Virginian"" that ran from 1962 to 1971.  After ""The Virginian"" McClure had a hit or miss career in the movies.  This particular movie is a campy bit of fun that is most assuredly not a family movie, though teenage boys will likely figure out a way to watch it.

The plot is a rehash of monster movie plots that date back to at least the 1950s.  We have local creatures that have mutated from fish to become somewhat humanoid.  The fish-humanoids move about as fast as an arthritic old man, but that somehow does not prevent the critters from killing dogs and people with abandon.  Even more interesting, the creatures seem to figure out a clever way to grab the local ladies, even though they often run away, and mate with them.

Somehow the cast manages to put in a decent acting job in spite of the monster silliness. Doug McClure is level-headed Jim Hill who battles local fisherman and bully Hank Slattery, played by Vic Morrow.  Ann Turkel plays a rare female scientist Dr. Susan Drake.  Then there are a number of very pretty monster victim babes.

When I watch this movie I think of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" because the monsters shamble along and yet they somehow manage to make victims of healthy men and women.  Though some of the victims fall prey to the monsters laying in wait for them, sometimes the victims fall prey through sheer silliness.  The monsters are certainly big and strong, and once a humanoid catches a victim the victim is unlikely to survive the encounter if male, and female victims are sexually violated.

The rape of female victims by the monsters raises this movie to a new low.  The scenes are graphic and while intended to be horrifying, often end up being a little silly.  The victims are stereotypically portrayed as scatterbrained bunnies bolting headlong from a monster only to fall prey to the monster as they somehow manage to fall and scream a lot.  For some strange reason the humanoids also have an interest in human female breasts as the monsters rip the bikini tops from their victims.  Of course, this movie also assumes that the genetically created monsters have no female monsters to mate with, unless the female monsters were stalking the men in the movie and we did not get to see that.

This movie also features a ""surprise"" ending that horror film fans will see coming well before the end of the movie.  Fans of director Roger Corman will likely intuit the ending from nearly the beginning.

In spite of the rehash of monster movies, and the gratuitous sex scenes, this movie is bad enough to be worth watching at least once.  The acting by the leads is decent, and there are some satisfying special effects.

Okay, that's fine, one expects that in such low-budget, drive-in fare.  The problem is that when the director objected to what amounts to scenes of  sexual violence against women, along with the bare breasts, Corman fired her and put in a new director.  That's really not cool.  The movie would have been fine without the depiction of the rapes -- at the very least, the camera could have cut away at one point, leaving us to imagine what may have happened, and it would have made the final scene even more effective.

As with most mutant creature films, there is usually a scientific project gone awry in their somewhere and this is no different.

This has led to the rapid evolution of half human half fish monsters - the ""humanoids from the deep"".  Of course in classic Roger Corman style these walking sea monsters are primarily concerned with making off with attractive young human girls so that they can mate with them and further evolve their bloodline.

815218,4,6304238142,"Pretty horrible, but bad in the Burial Ground or Pieces kind of way. The story here centers on a fishing town where the financial hub is evidently salmon. The fish have been thinning out, and all of the fishermen, morose beer-swilling lowlifes for the most part, are bitter. But there is one ray of hope in the form of the cannery that's supposed to revitalize the whole town. Add to this powder keg the Billy Jack-esque Indian guy that wants to preserve the land.
Apparently, a scientist working for the cannery has been tampering with salmon, I guess on some genetic level, to make better salmon or something. What this actually does is create a race of humanoid salmon, buck-toothed monsters with bulging brain sacks and gigantic rubber flippers. The monsters are coming ashore and mauling people, but they are particularly driven towards the chicks. You see, salmon monsters need love too, especially when it comes in the the form of bikini-clad or outright naked beach girls. There isn't much romanace involved. The girls just sort of scream and run, then make sure they fall once or twice so the rubber flipper tread can keep up with them. Now, when the girls aren't entertaining the salmon monsters, they're busy getting it on with land-based degenerates (who just want to drink some beer and have a good time.) More to the point, one girl, tenting on the beach near the tide line for some bizarre reason, is actually coaxed out of her clothes by a puppet with only slightly more finesse than the salmon monsters. There is one blonde girl, voluptuous, milky-skinned, that's kind of pretty, and the salmon monsters really take a liking to her. They take her to their lair, which is above ground, and this is okay, since the salmon monsters just randomly venture miles inland and take to the water only when it's convenient.
Eventually, one of the salmon monsters is killed, giving the salmon scientist a chance to study it and make a round of profound observations. Evidently these humanoid salmon are in fact humanoid, and their amphibious attack patterns suggest the fact that they might be turning amphibious! There's never really any satisfactory explanation as to why they chase girls. Probably it's just an ego thing. Or maybe they ARE just diehard romantics---personally I think that is the true reason. The Creature from the Black Lagoon needed love too, and his defense, they threw a super hot babe into each one of his movies, and that was because the Creature, unlike the salmon monsters, had panache and that quiet kind of cool.

815220,5,6304238142,"I consider myself well schooled in low budget schlock from various film genres. Watching cheesy films is an acquired taste, one not easily cultivated overnight. Even with some knowledge about who makes these types of films under my belt, I still stumble over major contributors to the clunker movie catalogue and wonder why I haven't spent time with these delicacies before now. Roger Corman is my latest discovery. I admit to having heard of Corman before in reference to the spate of Vincent Price horror classics that emerged in the 1960s along with a few other films he made over the course of his career, but until now I never saw any of them. This guy is a giant of the low budget film, producing or directing some 500 plus movies in the last forty years. He's still going strong as far as I know, and never limits himself to one particular genre; he's made westerns, horror, action, drama, and science fiction films with seeming ease. Moreover, according to the bio on this DVD, Corman helped launch the careers of numerous Hollywood bigwigs. If ""Humanoids From the Deep"" is any indication, I will spend a lot of time with this filmmaker's projects in the near future.
This movie really ought to be a huge cult cinema classic. Maybe it is in some circles, but if so, I never heard about it. What a shame, too, because ""Humanoids From the Deep"" is classic camp that rips off every 1950s monster film you ever heard about. The movie, set in a fishing town called Noyo, tells the story of a town rapidly fading away. The local tars are having a tough time catching enough fish to make a living, and just when it seems that all is lost a big time cannery corporation arrives on the scene promising to build a factory that will rejuvenate the local industry. Who can argue with an influx of well paying jobs? Certainly not a fisherman named Hank Slattery who sees dollar signs in the arrival of the suits. Most of the townspeople adopt Hank's position concerning the changing times, even level headed Jim Hill. Hill, who really doesn't care for Hank due to the man's racism against the local Indian tribe, grudgingly agrees that the cannery will help salvage the town. He's a bit suspicious about corporations in general, a thought shared by his wife, but he's willing to go along with it if it means food on table. The local Indians, led by Hank's nemesis Johnny Eagle, despise the idea of building a cannery on old tribal grounds. When a series of unexplainable incidents occur in rapid succession, the Indians and Slattery's goons duke it out with other over the future of the area.
What in the world could possibly cause all of the dogs in the area to die violently in the space of a single evening, lead to the disappearance of a few of the local ladies, and cause such discord between the Indians and the Anglo community? Why, humanoids from the deep, of course! That's right, within mere minutes we learn that Noyo has a big problem in the form of some weird half-salmon, half man beasties roaming around offshore. And these monstrosities take no prisoners, either, since they aren't above tearing open a few bodies, ripping off a few heads, or liberating a few bosoms in order to capture Noyo's women for mating purposes. Corman permeates this film with everything a low budget horror lover could want: completely unnecessary nudity, gallons of gore, and numerous massive explosions. The cars, houses, and boats blowing up in ""Humanoids From the Deep"" especially impressed me since the producers of the film sank a lot of money into these blossoming fireballs. This is obvious because they use the hilarious old ""numerous camera angles and quick cuts"" to get the most out of the effect. If you don't care explosions, there is always the gore to float your boat. The conclusion of the film, when Noyo celebrates their town festival and the humanoids make an impressive yet unannounced visit is sure to thrill you with the arterial sprays and gory amputations going on all over the place. What a great little film.
The performances aren't all that bad either. Vic Morrow plays Hank Slattery with all the menace you would expect from the late star. Doug McClure turns in steady work as the even tempered Jim Hill. The rest of the cast, while not as well known as these two actors, all do a pretty good job with their parts. Of course, the humanoids share top billing with the human actors, which is fine because the special effects used in creating these violent creatures worked quite well in my opinion. The humanoids are gruesome looking, with sharp teeth, oversized heads and arms, and a shambling gait resembling the undead in all of those Italian horror movies. I can't say I cared too much their endless shrieking and wailing, but the look and the unremitting violence of these monsters repeatedly entertains.
The DVD is quite a catch too (pun intended). You get five trailers: ""Humanoids From the Deep,"" ""Eat My Dust,"" ""Big Bad Mama,"" ""Death Race 2000,"" and ""Grand Theft Auto."" A short interview with Corman, conducted by Leonard Maltin, graces the DVD, along with bios for Corman and the cast. The film transfer looks good for an old film of this caliber, at least good enough to see all of the splattery effects and nubile young women running around town. ""Humanoids From the Deep"" is a must see for those looking for a way to spend a wacky eighty minutes.",1068508800,39,5373,4.686772486772487

815302,4,6304238142,"I love schlock!! I love cheese! ""Humanoids From The Deep"" is my dream come true! Roger Corman understands what makes a bad movie good. Picture if you will, a small village where fishing and drinking beer are the only activities. Imagine this town invaded by hordes of horny fishmen. Women are savagely attacked and impregnated (??). Nudity? This flick has more bouncing boobs than a 3 stooges marathon! Doug McClure is the goodguy. As usual, he pulls off his role with the skill and charisma of driftwood. Vic Morrow is the badguy (although he comes ""into the light"" at the end). He basically plays the same drunken bigot he played in ""Twilight Zone, The Movie"". Morrow is a great actor. No one does a better job of being menacing! I've been afraid of him ever since ""Blackboard Jungle""! Anyway, the Humanoids keep on raping and pillaging, until the great apocolyptic carnival scene! Lots of fake blood, explosions, and hand-to-fin combat! This film would make an excellent double feature with ""Horror Of Party Beach""! A must see...",1046995200,57,1032,4.869318181818182

It did have a happy ending though.",1032134400,,331,3.8955223880597014
815304,2,6304238142,"With a title called Humanoids from the Deep, you'd probably be pretty dumb to expect anything more than a schlocky B-movie.  And since I'm always game for a schlocky B-movie, I actually had decent expectations from this movie (even Leonard Maltin gave it 3 stars out of 4).  Maybe not so unsurprisingly, Humanoids turns out to be a pretty lame, but also rather watchable, ""monsters run amok"" flick.
The fishing village of Noyo has a few problems on its hands, actually rather a LOT, in the form of mutated salmon that want to kill all the men and rape the women.  We see this cycle play itself out for, well, the entire movie, so that's pretty much all there is plot-wise, excepting the Native American who has trouble from a bigot (played by Vic Morrow).
I've always said that it's entirely possible to make a truly entertaining film (for all the right reasons) from a fun premise.  So Humanoids from the Deep probably could have made for one wild little horror flick if not for the stilted pacing and second-rate creature effects.  The movie certainly has its heart set in the right place.  We've got all the ingredients we expect from a movie like this: lots of gore and gratuitous nudity.  Now only if the director could have crafted this with more competence and fun.
Humanoids feels almost two hours in length, even though it runs barely over eighty minutes.  The monotony is occasionally punctuated by the nudity and the kill scenes, but it's a shame all the moments in-between don't hold much interest.  This is probably because of the lack of atmosphere; director Barbara Peters doesn't give the film the much-needed creepy edge and look it demands.  The movie looks and sometimes feels a little bland.
Not helping matters much are the special effects, which are rather poor.  These mutated salmon are obviously just men in shoddy suits covered in seaweed.  The gore effects, while nothing great, are adequate enough, particularly in the extremely violent climax, which must have made the R-rating a close call.  Hard to believe the effects were done by Rob Bottin, who did such a masterful job on the visuals in The Thing.
Humanoids' pacing does get better in the last half hour, when all hell breaks loose, and we get a pretty nifty massacre at the end.  Peters even throws in some gunplay, which I imagine would have been more exciting with better direction and editing.  As far as script and acting goes, the former isn't quite as stupid as I'd expected it (don't get me wrong, the science is idiotic, though plot holes are sort of kept to a minimum) to be and the latter is actually not that bad for a Roger Corman production.
The score is done by none other than James Horner(!), who must have been in the budding stages of his career.  To his credit, he doesn't rip off John Williams, though the music does have a Bernard Herrman-esque sound to it.",1031184000,4,2864,4.664015904572564

Then someone says, ""Hey, that monster's (having sex) with that girl up there.""
Nobody said another word and we watched the rest of the movie.
After JAWS ('75), there was a deluge of drive-in B-movies set on or next to water.  ALIEN was another huge hit in '79 so then came all the cheap sci-fi knock-offs.  HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP combined/ripped-off both JAWS and ALIEN: you had the seaside setting as well as the slimy monsters.
Sure, it's an exploitation movie, but it also answered the age-old question of what monsters want with our women.  And it's pretty much what we suspected.
In the right frame of mind, this is a Drive In Classic.
(But be careful: there's an even-cheaper ""remake"" floating around out there with Robert Carradine, a sexless, humorless, drive-in-less knock-off so avoid the more recent version.

And since I'm a new devotee to the DVD format, my  comments refer to the DVD version of this classic Corman work.
The image quality is good in most of the scenes.  The audio quality is also good.  And the ""sleaze"" quality is great!  Some of Corman's best.  But the movie is not in widescreen format and the special features are not too special.  There is a trailer of the movie and some trailers of other Corman movies, some brief cast biographies, a scene index, a little booklet detailing the highlights of Corman's career, and a three minute Corman interview with film critic Leonard Maltin, which is not too informative.
In the interview Corman gives his not-too-original theory of how to scare audiences by not showing the monsters too much and letting the viewer's imagination do the work for him, a rule Humanoids seems to avoid, sine the mutant fish-men are on screen quite a lot.  He also gives credit to director Barbara Peeters, saying she was the right person for the job at the time.  However, he neglects to mention that both she and Ann Turkel, the female lead, both publicly denounced the movie and disavowed their parts in it, saying that Corman had turned it into ""a T & A flick!""
Barbara Peeters had directed at least one other Corman movie before Humanoids, so she should have known what was expected of her.  Evidently she and Turkel thought they were making a serious ecological disaster type movie, and were incensed when Corman brought in another director to add the nudity and rape scenes!  Not surprisingly, since she failed to live down to his expectations, Peeters never directed another Corman film.  She went into TV work instead.
During the production of this film, someone suggested that, for comic relief, one of the humanoids should be gay, and be seen attacking a male citizen of the small fishing village of Noyo, but Corman nixed the idea, saying, with a straight face, ""There are no homosexual humanoids!""
As to the movie itself, the cast is good: Vic Morrow, near the tragic end of his career, is very villainous; Doug McClure, always competent, is stalwart and brave; Ann Turkel is beautiful and resolute as the lady scientist; Cindy Weintraub is beautiful and courageous as McClure's wife.  And  Linda Shayne is beautiful and naked, as are Lynn Theel and Lisa Glaser, all hapless victims of the Humanoids.
