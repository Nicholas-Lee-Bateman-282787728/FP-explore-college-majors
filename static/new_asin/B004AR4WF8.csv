The documentary has some technical components, which my husband enjoyed, but it was easy enough for me to follow along too.  They filmmakers did a nice job of balancing  the technical aspects of the rescue with the emotional/human component. We really enjoyed this documentary, and it was just one hour, so it went by quickly!",1507161600,,426,4.716216216216216
