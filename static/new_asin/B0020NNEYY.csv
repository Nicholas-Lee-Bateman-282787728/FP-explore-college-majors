Sad though that talented actors like Ben and others do not receive deserved credit where it's due, nevertheless this is a must see :)",1422748800,,289,4.576923076923077
8348583,5,B0020NNEYY,"Sadly neglected comedy/drama.  I guess some Britons might find the entire idea of a movie where the protagonists are Soviet immigrants trying to leech off the government less than amusing, but these are two fairly likeable characters just trying to get by any way they can.  If they could work legitimately, they would, but they're forced through a series of often-hilarious misadventures, all quite believable.

Not sure if the two leads have been in any other films of note, but they deliver 100% in their roles, accompanied by an oft-impressive cast of unknowns.  Last but not least: a fine soundtrack rounds out this top-notch B-movie -- I haven't seen it 50 times for nothing :-)",1405123200,,684,4.921739130434783
8348584,5,B0020NNEYY,"""Bigga Than Ben"" is a quirky story about two guy pals, sort of a ""road picture"" for the present generation. I loved the film. It is never boring: it never lets up. Ben Barnes is an extremely under-rated actor. Take a chance on this one.",1371686400,,236,4.266666666666667
