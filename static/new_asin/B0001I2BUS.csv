2002811,4,B0001I2BUS,"Nicely packaged documentary not only about Brit pop, but 90's Britian period. The main focus is on Oasis & Blur, with some Jarivs/Pulp (but not nearly enough). Live Forever runs a little over an hour and also touches on politics, fashion, and art of the time. I had nearly forgotten about that horribly cheesey Vanity Fair cover with Liam and Patsy, but there it was--along with a flood of memories of the time.",1110931200,5,411,4.6438356164383565
2002812,5,B0001I2BUS,"I hate people who complain that films don't have enough of some element, some band who they want to see. There are enough Oasis, Blur and Pulp videos out there to catch up on. There is John Harris' Britpop book. Britpop WAS a media invention. It is a tired subject. But it did happen. It is essential to talk about the Blur vs. Oasis thing at some point. I feel that this film succeeded at some point. There are another hour of interviews with the bands as a bonus. If you don't like this film, make your own. It will probably suck. It will probably have a thousand close shots of Jarvis Cocker. That is just fandom. That is monomania. That is not narrative filmmaking.",1102464000,6,669,4.36
2002813,3,B0001I2BUS,"The idea of this DVD appealed to me greatly.  As someone who was in college during what many consider to be the height of the 90's BritPop craze, I was totally immersed in this music! Having had no particular interest in the grunge scene of the early 90's, to me, the BritPop renaissance was a Godsend!

Having said that, when I saw this DVD at the store just the other day, I figured I would give it a try.  While there are terrific moments, the whole affair comes up short.

Sure, it's great to see such in-depth interviews with the likes of The Gallagher Brothers from OASIS, Damon Albarn from BLUR and Jarvis Cocker from PULP, but there is so much missing!

I guess I was hoping for more live performance footage.  The breif excert they show of PULP singing COMMON PEOPLE from Knebworth was a real highlight! But, as I said, it was breif.

My biggest problem is the fact that the film focuses a little too much on the old OASIS vs. BLUR argument.  What about all the other great bands of that era? Sure, they talk a bit about PULP and they do give some credit to the STONE ROSES, but there were so many other bands that were either mentioned breifly or not at all.  It would have been nice to see and hear more from amazings bands like SUEDE, THE VERVE, and RADIOHEAD.

Still, there are moments that make this DVD at least worth renting.  It's worth it alone to see Noel Gallagher and Damon Albarn sadly discuss the demise of this great movement in music.

In closing, this DVD is not a must to avoid.  If you are a fan of BritPop, you will enjoy it, but you will inevitably be craving more when it is over.",1099872000,4,1611,4.2772277227722775
2002814,4,B0001I2BUS,"""Live Forever"" takes a sleek, well-documented look at ""Cool Britannia,"" the British pop movement of the 1990s that briefly filled the void left by the demise of Nirvana and provided a soundtrack for the new era of Tony Blair and the Labour Party.

Though the DVD box promises looks at great bands such as Radiohead, The Verve, Elastica, Massive Attack and Portishead, those groups are just name-checked. The movie is actually dominated by Oasis, Pulp and Blur, three of the era's most popular bands who flew high for a while, got bogged down by feuding and excess and eventually tanked out.  My only quibble is that the movie pokes a stick into the old Blur/Oasis rivalry; the feud was a marketing gimmick but the movie lingers on it too long and structures its coverage so that Damon Albairn (who famously came out on the bottom) gets kicked while he's down.

Seemingly taking its cue from the Experience Music Project's excellent musical history ""Rock and Roll,"" ""Live Forever"" offers well-negotiated & stylishly arranged interviews (check Noel Gallagher being questioned first in the study of a posh estate, then later in what appears to be a ship's cargo hold), period clips and also sends a cool, composed camera into the areas from which the music came -- the streets of Manchester, the highways of Bristol and carefully tended suburbs.

Though the movie scatters details in a somewhat disorienting way that almost demands a repeat viewing, the interviews and the music are excellent.",1093910400,10,1490,4.948
2002815,2,B0001I2BUS,"I recieved this DVD for my birthday. I was currently in college in england when this all took place and it brings back great memories to see various brit bands. Unfortunately I think the documentary lingers too long on the thoughts and opinions of the Gallagher brothers, making it very one sided. I think for a documentary to work a view from various sides of the story have to be covered, and to a ceratin extent it was, with views from Jarvis Cocker, Damon Alban, and some very snooty music journalist who seemed very out of place, but there was very little input from one of the most important parts of the equation; the fans. The DVD mentions music by various brit bands, but barely plays a few seconds of each. Before you know it the documentary is talking about the appearance of Robbie Williams and the Spice Girls. Come on..... thats quite a jump, not to mention the a lack of discussion about how these bands of the 90's have been so influential to the music of the day.

 I think any Britpop fan around in the mid 90's could have written a better diary of events than this documentary. There just seems like a little is missing.",1090972800,14,1139,4.444976076555024
2002816,4,B0001I2BUS,"I was at university in Wales at about the time when this all took off and this DVD filled me with a warm nostalgic glow, with occasional goose bumps, remembering how vital the whole scene was. The Oasis and Blur duel really was an important national news story. People actually bothered to watch Top of the Pops every Thursday. British music and film seemed to matter internationally and was finally taking over from Nirvana-alikes like Stone Temple Pilots and Soundgarden. Whilst detailing the main players in the music scene, you also see how the whole Britpop phenomenon was tied up with the political paradigm shift in the mid-90s from Conservative to New Labour and Alistair Campbell's Machiavellian meddling.

 One caveat, for ""Britpop"", read Blur, Oasis and Pulp, as no one else really gets a look in. Given that the whole documentary weighs in at a mere 86 minutes, maybe that's as wide ranging as you could make it. That said, I'd like to have heard other Blur members' takes on events, or even just more from Jarvis Cocker or (the lovely) Louise Wener . It would certainly have benefited from heavier editing of the ramblings of fashionista, Oswald Boeteng and that bloke from Loaded magazine. The Gallagher brothers both make riveting viewing, as ever, even if they can't stand to be in the same room these days- Noel waxes lyrical about his working-class roots from what looks like one of the more elegant rooms of Balmoral Castle.

 For an acid take on how Britpop was already in decline by the time of the Vanity Fair cover I'd recommend Hugo Young's book, ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"". He was one of the people responsible for getting the unlikely cover stars to the photo shoot and is not shy in describing the monstrous, coke-fuelled egos involved.

 I heartily recommend this to anyone with even a fleeting interest in Blur, Oasis or Pulp. It offers a fair amount of insight into the 90s British music scene and while it could be more thorough and take in more bands, it does cover a lot of ground in a short time. If you've never watched a UK documentary and have grown up with VH1's Behind the Music or even Michael Moore, then you should watch this just to see that you don't have to cram in 30 different camera angles per minute to keep viewers interested. A very tastefully-presented film peopled with interesting characters and with a top-notch soundtrack.",1090800000,6,2393,4.740384615384615
2002817,3,B0001I2BUS,"Although a bit scant and lacking in depth overall, this rock doc about the rise and fall of Britpop deserves an ""E"" for effort, trying to encapsulate What It All Meant in just over 90 minutes. The golden era of ""Britpop"", as defined by the filmmakers, begins in 1994 with the release of Oasis' ""What's The Story Morning Glory?"" and is bookended by the death of Princess Di in 1997. The ""movement"" involved not only music, but a sea change in British fashion, movies, and politics. Present-day interviews with the brothers Gallagher (Oasis), Jarvis Cocker (Pulp) and Damon Albairn (Blur)take up the majority of screen time, with teasingly short performance clips of key acts sprinkled in. The reflections range from thoughtful (Jarvis Cocker) to exasperating (Liam Gallagher, whose unintelligible mumbling and belligerent glare adds little insight to the precedings). The filmmakers spend too much time trying to rekindle the infamous (and silly) Blur vs Oasis ""rivalry"" hype by pushing an obviously reticent Damon Albairn to put in his two shillings worth (Noel Gallagher, on the other hand, readily takes the bait). The only real revelation for this viewer was the filmaker's interesting conjecture that this cultural explosion was primarily a ""rebellion"" by a new generation of Brits against the creeping ""Americanization"" of thier pop culture (Sort of a Boston Tea Party in reverse?! Discuss.) Worthwhile as a collectible for Anglophiles and/or fans of this specific music genre, other non-Brits will likely just shrug and think ""Why an entire film on this subject?"".",1090800000,2,1570,5.234126984126984
2002818,4,B0001I2BUS,"I recommend ""Live Forever"" to the fans and the curious as the story of Britpop is documented from beginning to....not exactly THE end as the Blur/Oasis contest continues in the form of Who Is The Most Dull And Pretentious:  Is it Insane Liam from Oasis lounging in the midst of what appears to be a secondhand furniture sale (or his living room) or Barely Awake Damon from Blur who plays the ""I am SO over it"" role to such extent he feels the need to strum a ukulele during the last half of his narcoleptic Q&A.  woo hoo.
These interviews are from the NOW however THEN in America we were being smothered with bad indie and drama dummies such as Smashing Pumpkins and NIN so by the time US MTV got hold of Britpop it was with much hesitation and unattractively attached to the ""Firestarter"" video by Prodigy.
Yes, ""Live Forever"" is reliable without the fast sound bites or the know-nothing-all-knowing TV presenter.
The film details the hype, the clubs, drugs, BLAIR/Oasis, snapshots and NME covers in amazing, almost glorious montages then follows each segment with a less than intentional ""come-down"" as if reliving tragedy.  Smile! It was fun! Right?
Many interviews conducted in dim settings and while Noel Gallagher is hilarious from a distance Jarvis Cocker of Pulp is poorly misrepresented as a near casualty when in fact Cocker is  the most intelligent. How can Jarvis seem less witty than  Noel Gallagher- leading me to ask ""Who edited the last 20 minutes?"" which is where the presentation falls apart. The problems are the uncertain end and not enough substance however many bland dialogues from Ozwald Boatneg (designer AND tailor) and Damien Hirst (he ruined Blur in just three and a half minutes). I can live (forever?) with the baggage though the biggest flaw is no mention of the disappearance of Richey from Manic Street Preachers which gained so much media attention and general hysteria it grew to  overshadow Britpop and helped put the Manics at #1.
Whatever the reason, no excuse for ignoring it.
Worth seeing, glad i own it and most American bands STILL
suck so maybe Blur and Oasis both won.",1087084800,5,2112,4.788461538461538
2002819,4,B0001I2BUS,"I watched a new to DVD documentary called ""Live Forever"" this weekend and it's entertaining as hell. Most of the interviews feature the big names of the era: Damon, Noel, Liam, Jarvis and other assorted talking heads and pundits.
In addition to the 90 min main film, there is a supplement with all the interview bits they didn't edit in, and that section has some priceless moments, especially from Liam. Two examples:
Interviewer: You've often been described as androgynous..
Liam: What's that mean?
I: You have a feminine quality...
Liam: What's that mean?
I: You have a look that's neither masculine or feminine exactly...
Liam: You mean I look like a bird?
and he goes on to explain that he does care about how his hair looks cuz that's important.
I: ""Live Forever"" has been mentioned as a song that cystalizes the mid 90s. What's that song about?
Liam: It's about living forever, innit?
Lots of good music and vintage footage, but overall a somewhat surface look despite getting all the main participants to agree to on camera interviews.
Worth at least renting.
I would also recommend John Harris' more insightful book about BritPop in the 90s called ""The Last Party.""",1084665600,15,1174,4.845771144278607

That is what got me the most about this movie.  I do love Noel outlook on life I would love to have a chat with him at a pub.

2002821,4,B0001I2BUS,"Live Forever was a comedic take on the decade known as the 90s and the rise in British music scene at the time. The main bands interviewed were Blur and Oasis, but several other bands were mentioned, such as Nirvana. Several other things were adressed, such as the well-known feud between both Blur and Oasis. I will admit that Damon Albarn (lead singer and writer of Blur) came off as rude in this film.

I viewed this first as a rental in 2005, couldn't recall the dvd name, just 'Oasis, Blur, something, something.' They didn't have a clue at the rental place so I gave up. Then I found it on Amazon!
It is a fantastic time travel agency of the early 90's-complete with references to Nirvana and Grunge. You can almost feel the weird mix of mosh-pit and pasty voiced post-Thatcher creative release. Bits of contemporary videos by Stone Roses, Oasis, Blur, Pulp and interviews spice it up for you fellow Anglophiles.
Makes you wish there'd been a Malcom McClaren floating about, then the Blur/Oasis brou-ha-ha could've been fun. I find the Gallaghers mono-browed and over rated myself-though Blur's almost as ego-driven.
I was working with the manager of Everclear back then; broken noses, mosh pits and the Pacific NW seriously edged out any britpop being here. This is a gem which puts you THERE!",1212537600,,1100,5.748466257668712

Granted some of its theories revolving the BritPop movement seem overextended, it still provides a bit of entertainment. You might not agree with some of the theories, but its still worth a listen. Anyway, the DVD devotes a most of its time to the 3 biggest bands at the time : Oasis, Blur, and Pulp. (Well, I guess the Verve should also be included, but I doubt the reclusive Richard Ashcroft was willing to give an interview). The DVD is worth a go just for the great MUSIC, the hilarious (and on-the-spot) GALLAGHER Bros. interviews,  and Jarvis' insight. BTW, Damon Albarn comes off as a real tool.

2002828,4,B0001I2BUS,"I was in college when the Brit Pop phenomena hit.  But I was a snob back then, deeply involved in my college radio station and turning my nose up at this tripe.  Oh that was just too mainstream and commercial for ME to like!  Of course I've since matured, and I gave Brit Pop a chance since then, and this documentary taught me a few things I otherwise didn't know.

There is a curious phenomena that takes place between America and the UK in terms of pop culture.  One gentleman made a comment about a pendulum swing back and forth between the two, and that is certainly true now that I think about it.  I had heard of The Stone Roses, but they never caught on with avengence here.  Then, of course, Nirvana happened and eclipsed everything else.  After Kurt died in 94, Oasis began to rise and the UK's ""grunge years"" began.  I heard stories about all the kids in the UK chasing after Oasis and their packed, sold out shows, and a new chapter began.

This documentary concentrates mostly on the Gallagher brothers.  Noel is far more well spoken than Liam (but everyone knows that because I don't think he's spent nearly as much time pickling himself), everything Noel said seemed to have more meaning behind it.  They interviewed a few more people, such as Damien from Blur and the guy from Pulp.  Damien seems like a real downer, they should've given the guy from Pulp more of a say as he seemed a little more animated than Blur.  I liked the Beatles vs. Rolling Stones - type rivalry established against Blur and Oasis (seeing whose album would hit #1 first), but you can tell that they really weren't interested and it was a creation by the press.  Plus, you got the impression that London was swinging again like the mods in the 60s.

It is a little ironic that they too fell into the same traps that we did in America with the death of grunge.  Heroin too had them in their grasp (referencing Blur's song ""BeetleBum"", as it was supposed to be about heroin).  And, a celebrity death ended their trip as well (ours was Kurt's, theirs was Princess Diana).

Here it is 10 years later.  Blur and Pulp seem to have gone the way of the dodo, but Oasis is still around.  They're not the hot phenomena they were, but they continue to make music and seem to have staying power (when they're not fighting or drunk/high).  Now Coldplay seems to be the one leading the Brit Pop charge.  Maybe they will, in fact, live forever.",1125446400,2,2420,4.437641723356009

8012848,3,B0001I2BUS,"I read many 5-Star reviews & ratings of LIVE FOREVER DVD before deciding to purchase it.  I was disappointed.  In my opinion, in the LIVE FOREVER DVD there are not nearly enough musical 'clips', or concert footage for a documentary on music & culture in Britain in the 90's.  The Oasis interviews are skimpy (both with the Gallagher brothers and none with fans).  And, Liam & Noel's interviews are all separate; none of the brothers together.

For any 90's music documentary to have so little muscial & inteview coverage of & by Oasis ...tsk, tsk; shame; shame (Especially a British one! C'mon!)  There was nothing about the shoe-gaze category of Britpop or any of those bands, nor any other sub-categories...far, far too many bands not covered at all!! (And, I believe there were plenty to choose from). Only a brief one-liner about The Stone Roses.  Again, not nearly enough Manchester coverage, as a lot of bands were making their way having had Manchester as their homebase.  LIVE FOREVER did have a few funny moments...again, not nearly as many as I would have thought after reading reviews of LIVE FOREVER.

In LIVE FOREVER, I did learn more about the British economy and politics from the 80's & into the 90's with Margaret Thatcher's reign as Britain's Prime Minister. I hadn't realized things were so bad during that time.  I knew about Tony Blair having been in a band in his youth.  So, I learned more about recent British history... more about the Labor Party vs. Convervative.  More about the Oasis vs. Blur biz (which I was always a bit 'hazy' on; both to the extent & the reason).

Something we're very much lacking in the U.S. is a show like ""Top of the Pops"" or ""Later....with Jools Holland"" (he being, formerly part of 80's band, Squeeze) The show is akin to Ed Sullivan during the 1st British Invasion.  We haven't had any shows like that in decades; nor can we even catch them now, on DVD, since they're only available on PAL format & here we need NTSC format.

It was also more than a little jolting to learn just how much the Brits disdained the Americans during this period in recent history.  Oasis was never quiet on this issue, but I didn't realize how widespread it was felt by Brit's (and this was slightly mentioned in LIVE FOREVER).  I suppose I've been aware that the term ""The Ugly American"" exists for a reason & I've been vaguely aware that we're hated by other countries; seen as a bit prudish by Europeans & also as wasteful, glutonous consumers (which is simply not true).  Our own media certainly does nothing to change other countries' ideas of the United States & its' image.  However, it's a sweeping generalization & generalizations can be dangerous.  Americans don't all spend their time playing computer games, eating & drinking everything ""oversize"" & wandering about malls looking to spend...being the ""spendthrifts"" we're made out to be.  Those are brash generalizations about Americans.  And, LIVE FOREVER does nothing to change this viewpoint, but only serves to reiterate it.

I've always felt that our own news coverage doesn't give us enough of world news.  I learn more from communicating with individuals in the U.K.  I was surprised that it was felt there was a vacuum in British music during the 80's into the mid-90's, as told in LIVE FOREVER.  The early to mid-80's was when I was in clubs.  There was plenty of music during that time period that I recall the U.S. making & that was imported from England & Australia.  I, myself, probably listened to Billy Idol & Joan Jett, equally.  Many great imports from Britain: New Order, Simple Minds, Chrissie Hynde & The Pretenders, Duran Duran, Annie Lenox & Eurythemics, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, ABC, Culture Club, Erasure, Human League, Squeeze, Tears for Fears, The Clash (70's into 80's) Judas Priest.  Australia gave us INXS, Midnight Oil, Men At Work, I think Echo & The Bunnymen, Psychedelic Furs & Siouxsie Sue & the Banshees.  A tremendous British export & a band that's endured: Depeche Mode (still going strong since the 80's, currently touring their latest release this year ""Delta Machine"" & sound great!!!  No appearances on LIVE FOREVER).  I make mention of this only because it was spoken of in LIVE FOREVER; how ""awful"" the music of the 80's was, as a prelude to how Britpop began in the 90's.  I think the writers & producers should go back & give another listen to 80's music from both sides of the Atlantic, before dismissing an entire decade of music.  I could go on & on with bands & Britpop sub-categories which received no coverage whatsoever on LIVE FOREVER...

SPOILER ALERT: The Stone Roses have reunited & are touring.  I've caught appearances on youtube & they sound terrific.  Only sad part, at one concert I caught, Ian Brown did a ""rap"" during ""Love Spreads""; don't get me wrong, he did a fantastic job.  It just saddens me that ""rap"" is in England, now, too...Well, it took a good quarter-century, since ""rap"" became mainstream in U.S. with The Beastie Boys & Vanilla Ice: combined with grunge (which was started, in my opinion, not by Nirvana or Pearl Jam or any of the Seattle bands, but before the 90's; in the 80's by R.E.M. out of North or South Carolina (I don't remember which); it was ""stripped down & the antithesis of 80's music"": the beginning of the end of rock 'n roll in America (sorry Neil Young ""...Hey, Hey, My, My..Rock n'Roll Will Never Die"").

Perhaps in LIVE FOREVER, when they mention this ""vacuum"", they're referring more to late 80's (?I just don't know).  I do recall even here, the rock music wasn't coming out of NYC in the late 80's; by then, it had moved to L.A.  I remember all the ""hair bands"" of L.A. (i.e. Motley Crue, Poison) & Def Leppard & The Cult as being pretty terrific imports from England for the late 80's.

I do recall that the 80's was the decade of excess here (I know when I look back, the 80's was definitely my favorite decade!)  Where the 90's was issuing in a period of hopefulness in England, here it was just the opposite (more akin to hopelessness); the 80's were known as the ""go-go"" 80s & I can see how Americans were taken to have too much (of, basically, everything) & were much too preoccupied with over-the-top consumerism.

However, the pendulum turns...The 90's rolled in, doing a complete 180 shift from the 80's. The 90's seemed to start a big shift in music, culture, everything becoming just plain depressing & I really don't think we've ever really come back; certainly not with rock 'n roll (although the new century does seem to be making more strides; however, the rock bands do seem more 'metal'-based, than pure rock).  I do think, however, this frequently happens from decade to decade: it's a ""clean sweep""; everything that was ""in"" is ""out"" & vice versa.

I think both the U.S. & U.K. may each have a lot of wonder about the other & neither country supplies nearly enough information to feed our curiousity.

Regarding the music, when I feel I need to hear some ""new"" rock, I actually look to the past & try 'n discover, or rediscover bands that I wasn't aware of at the time; or, find that I appreciate their sound now, when I previously may not have.  I was in an INXS phase for about 3 years; then once I heard Beady Eye, backtracked into Oasis & now am going into The Stone Roses & Primal Scream.  I also only recently developed an appreciaton for Depeche Mode.  Also discovered a late 80's Brit gem called Flesh for Lulu.  This LIVE FOREVER DVD would be great if it were part of a series; because it really seemed to just give a little ""glimpse"".

I learned, from LIVE FOREVER, more about the Union Jack.  I had no idea it was considered ""racial"" (as here, the Confederate flag is).  I did also re-learn about the ""Class"" system in Britain.  I suppose we do take some things for granted here, in America, if we are fortunate enough to be born middle or upper-middle class & certainly upper class.  There are probably more opportunities here to work your way up to it, if you're not born into it.  In LIVE FOREVER DVD, through viewing neighborhoods (however briefly), you could sense not abject poverty; but not the affluence that most Americans do take for granted.

If you want to watch a true 5-Star musical documentary, catch ""Rock 'N' Roll Exposed: The Photography of Bob Gruen"", which spans approx. 5 decades, has many in-depth interviews with Yoko Ono, Julian Lennon, Deborah Harry, Iggy Pop, Billy Joe Armstrong (of Green Day), to name just a few.  There's coverage of loads of bands...Led Zeppelin, John Lennon, The New York Dolls, Ramones, Sex Pistols... I've watched it twice, just recently, on Showtime and found it to be fascinating!  If it's in your area, I highly recommend it, or buy it!!  It's money well-spent!

In closing, regarding LIVE FOREVER: it's a good historical, political & cultural documentary; it just didn't go nearly deep enough, nor offer enough musically to be considered a musical documentary. I would still be interested if this were to be expanded upon with more discs to be added & made a collection, which could be purchased singly or as a whole.",1376611200,,9101,4.677763819095477

8012850,4,B0001I2BUS,It helps me know more about Brit-pop and everything I've been listening to. Oasis was so great. What a pity the brothers broke up.,1363046400,,130,4.458333333333333
8012851,5,B0001I2BUS,"This is one of the funniest music documentaries ever.  I first saw an edited version of this a few years ago on BBCA and was hooked.  It reminded me of all the great music to come out of England in the mid 90s, and how so much of it was sadly overlooked by most Americans. First off, the Gallaghers are just hilarious for different reasons, but the way the documentary put the music into political and artistic context was just great.  The Oasis cover band didn't really work for me, and the ending came a bit suddenly, but overall 5 stars, other documentaries should aim for this.",1352332800,,581,4.411214953271028
8012852,4,B0001I2BUS,"This was a great time for British music, and if you are of a certain age, you will enjoy this. If you like Dizzee Rascal and girls aloud, I probably wouldn't bother with it. However, if you have GOOD taste in British music, then this is for you. A little slow at times, but it captures the mood of the era well.",1321833600,,311,4.032258064516129
