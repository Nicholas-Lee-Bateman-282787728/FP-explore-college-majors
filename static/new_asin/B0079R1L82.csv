5070262,5,B0079R1L82,"I am a great fan of 40's movies, have grown to love Dana Andrews movies, but for some reason never saw this one.  Turned on TCM and there was Dana's face on the screen, I immediately sat down to watch even thought I missed about 45 minutes of it.
What a truly wonderful movie and love story which we don't have enough of in today's movies.  Then on top of that to be treated to the most wonderful music that I would pay big bucks to hear at the theater.  The best cast of 40's actors that made me feel at home again.  As I watched the story it had almost the same story line of
""Random Harvest"" which of course is the all time best love story, but Dana and Meryl made this story just as wonderful.  I can't wait to get the DVD and watch this one many times over.",1401408000,11,762,3.986842105263158
5070263,5,B0079R1L82,"Without the performances of Dana Andrews, Merle Oberon, Ethyl Barrymore and Hoagy Carmichael, this film would be laughable. Merle Oberon plays a conveniently, fantastically wealthy woman of the Arts, who finds a skilled pianist [Dana Andrews] performing exotic jazzy orchestrations in a nightclub. Intrigued by the music, she wants to meet him and is shocked to learn he's blind, and cynical. A thoroughly preposterous love story ensues, with bad pacing to boot. But there are some interesting choices made with the music (composed by Leith Stevens) and it's got to be worth it to see real San Francisco street scenes, real Arthur Rubenstein, Eugene Ormandy, and Carnegie Hall. Better scripts have been written and 5 stars is generous, I agree - but the performances are so high quality, you can keep watching it. Not typical, that's for sure.",1387324800,4,843,5.115942028985507

5070265,5,B0079R1L82,"Dana Andrews & Merle Oberon star as a blind pianist (Andrews) who falls in love with a blind girl (Oberon) who is a patron of the arts.  There are a few surprises in the film which also stars Ethel Barrymore and Hoagy Carmichael playing the usual stock characters they have been known for.  But the big surprise is the blind composer's Concerto played by the inimitable Artur Rubenstein at Carnegie Hall in NYC.

It is a romantic tear jerker with Andrews and Oberon giving terrific performancesl

5070266,5,B0079R1L82,"This is one of those shmaltzy romances from the 40s which today's audience probably wouldn't warm up to but was de rigueur for its time. Merle Oberon, a wealthy single woman, befriends and then falls in love with blind composer Dana Andrews. She initially pretends to be blind and presents herself as just another ordinary woman in love with his music, which she is, when she deliberately schemes to meet him. Attracted to his music, she wants to get Andrews out of a funk and plans to help him with her wealth but doesn't want him to know what she is up to lest he reject her largesse out of pride. She assumes her real guise to finance Andrews' compositional efforts without his knowledge and, in so doing, develops a separate relationship with him. He, of course, has no idea that the two women are one and the same. He appears to fall in love with the latter but, quite obviously, has strong feelings for the former. ""Wealthy"" Oberon puts Andrews in contact with an eye specialist who restores his sight.
Long story short: Andrews completes his piano concerto (actually composed by film composer Leith Stevens) and has it premiered with Arthur Rubenstein at the piano and Eugene Ormandy as conductor.
The concerto is well received and an apparent success (the richly attired all white audience would be jarring to present day audiences). While it is being played, Andrews cannot help but think of ""blind"" Oberon and, at the end, tells his sidekick (Hoagy Carmichael) that they are going to California where ""blind"" Oberon lives. Hoagy runs to tell ""wealthy"" Oberon (he knows all along about the duplicity) what Andrews intends.  Hoagy and Andrews take a train to California. Oberon flies to California (she can afford it and they can't, I guess). Andrews arrives at her home, the front door is unlocked (sigh, welcome to the 1940s), Andrews goes into the house and hears his concerto being played by Oberon on her piano. As he enters the room where she is playing, he gradually sees that ""blind"" Oberon is the same as ""wealthy"" Oberon; he smiles, sits down next to her, and they both play. Ethel Barrymore, Oberon's aunt?, comes to the edge of the room, sees the two, smiles, and retreats to the kitchen.  Happy ending.
As the title to this review indicates: the best part is the Concerto. It deservedly takes its place in Hollywood filmdom music alongside the Warsaw Concerto by Richard Addinsell and the Spellbound Concerto by Miklos Rozsa. Unfortunately, it is only available in an out of print CD from Elan titled ""Piano in Hollywood"" (which has 8 Hollywood Piano Concertos and 1 Piano Solo). Therefore, this DVD (long overdue) is most worthwhile as a substitute for the CD music.",1367625600,5,2688,4.778494623655914
5070267,4,B0079R1L82,"This 1947 black and white 102 minutes long movie was digitally remastered and put on DVD in 2012 with Dolby sound. The story is quite beautiful; About a blind pianist/composer that composes a piano Concerto and finally gets to hear it played by Artur Rubinstein pianist and Eugene Ormandy conducting the New York Philharmonic. The music is actually a piano Concerto in one movement by Leith Stevens which is quite beautiful and sounds a lot like early Scriabin with a bit of Gershwin here and there. Great care was obviously taken in making this movie, the script, acting, photography and overall feeling is one of dedication to promoting the very beautiful music that the story revolves around. I accidentally first heard this Concerto on Youtube and really liked it so I bought the DVD.Artur Rubinstein and Eugene Ormandy are magnificent and quite unforgettable. So if you are tired of the mindless sex and violence that seems to predominate todays films, this DVD might suit your needs very well.",1350950400,17,999,4.9523809523809526

8512979,5,B0079R1L82,"An underrated film and excellently acted out by Dana Andrews and great to see Rubinstein and Ormandy in action, good acting all round.",1475107200,,134,4.869565217391305
8512980,4,B0079R1L82,"NIGHT SONG might only appear to be a routine example of the kind of postwar romance that most of the major studios produced. A blind bar pianist (Dana Andrews) is taken up by a wealthy socialite (Merle Oberon), who pretends to be blind herself in order to secure his confidence. After a courtship in San Francisco, the pianist is given sufficient financial backing to have an operation to restore his sight, and receive a concert premiere of his new concerto at Carnegie Hall, New York. He returns to San Francisco, where he meets his beloved, and the two them vow eternal love.

Frank Renton and Dick Irving Hyland's screenplay contains its fair share of intertexts. The idea of a concert performance dates back to Brian Desmond Hurst's huge British wartime hit DANGEROUS MOONLIGHT (1941), that contained the premiere of Addinsell's ""Warsaw Concerto,"" while Andrews's predicament as a war-scarred survivor cross-references Goldwyn's THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946), in which the actor had given an equally memorable characterization in a similar role.

Yet nonetheless NIGHT SONG possesses a certain integrity. Director John Cromwell establishes a close bond between Andrews and his boon companion Chick (Hoagy Carmichael, who even gets a solo number), and by doing so suggests the importance of male bonding in an often uncertain world. No one, it seems, knows really what to do with the peace, after having won the war; the only outlet both men can find is playing bands in some cheap SF dive bars.

This relationship is contrasted with the more spiky friendship between Oberon and her boon companion Miss Willey (Ethel Barrymore). The grande dame of the American theater gives one of her more commanding characterizations as a supposed cynic with a heart of gold, who readily understands the agonies her younger friend experiences as she tries to woo the pianist without hurting his feelings. In an environment where people seldom gave vent to their emotions in public, emotional expression is put at a premium.

The end of the movie is enlivened by a live performance from Leopold Stokowski and Eugeme Ormandy playing themselves with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. They do not have to do much, but they set about delivering the concerto (with music by Leith Stevens) with a conviction and gusto that is truly refreshing.",1473379200,,2334,5.054545454545455
8512981,3,B0079R1L82,"As much as I admire Dana Andrews's style of  acting, I found this boring. The two stars were mismatched. Hoagy Carmichael was the best part.",1466726400,,140,4.6
