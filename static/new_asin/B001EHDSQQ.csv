3554116,5,B001EHDSQQ,"I finally purchased all episodes of Jimmy Neutron. Jimmy Neutron is not for children only. The DVD's are excellent for those students who are not so interesting in science as well as those who love science of course. The students that are not interested will clearly look at science differently and grow to love science. My granson is almost 4 years old. He will be attending a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematic)magnet school. I am using Jimmy Neutron DVD's to help ""BaKari"" create a love for Science, Technology,Engineer and Mathematics. Jimmy Neutron is always inventing something. The episodes are educational, animatedly vibrant, witty and exciting. His vocabulary and educational level is amazingly of a genuis. BaKari totally loves Jimmy Neutron and so do I.",1344124800,,781,5.256

This is a very good Jimmy Neutron DVD Collection.
-First, about Jimmy Neutron, in case you don't know. Jimmy is a Boy Genius, a cartoon from Nickelodeon. He invents all kinds of wonderful devices, from a simple Hovercar, to Shrink Rays and Books On Gum (Something Amazon should explore.) Adventures and silliness always follow! Jimmy is often accompanied by his friends, Sheen and Carl, his best buddies; Jimmy's robotic pet dog, Goddard, who can do eleven million and four things; and two girls named Cindy and Libby, who by this time are starting to like Jimmy and Sheen.
-The animation is simply superb; three dimensional computer graphics with astonishing attention to detail, reflections, shadows, mirrors, and moving backgrounds. It's not Pixar, but it sure isn't the Fairly Oddparents either. Better still, every episode is at least funny, and at most fall-on-the-floor hilarious.
-The Collection is very good. Though I know many Neutron fans were disappointed Nick didn't just release the series in its entirety. But some Jimmy is better than no Jimmy. Still, there are no DVD special add-ons at all, which is disappointing. No behind-the-scenes, storyboards, commentary, or anything. Just the shows. It should be noted that the DVDs are formatted DVD-R so they will probably not work on older DVD players.
-But the shows are definitely worth having. Nightmare in Retroville is the famous and little seen Halloween episode. While Grumpy Young Men is the funniest episode Jimmy Neutron has ever done. Almost every line uttered in that show will make you split a gut laughing.

Hugh Neutron (Jimmy's Father): ""Hey old timer! I like the way you're wearing your pants! I've been thinking about wearing my pants like that! Maybe growing out my nose hair. Say, you look familiar...""
Jimmy (Now accidentally aged to about 65 years old): ""I'm just a weird old man and not your son after screwing up an experiment!""

3554127,5,B001EHDSQQ,"Television cartoons of today lacks a certain wit. Among the bright animations and ridiculous caricatures lie no substance. ""Jimmy Neutron"" was and still is different. The animated Nickelodeon sitcom about a boy genius and the misadventures that accompany him and his friends brims to the bone with wit. Along with a stellar voice cast, the storylines are simple to follow, yet cleverly written to entertain both adult and adolescent. 5 stars.",1469059200,,442,5.23943661971831
