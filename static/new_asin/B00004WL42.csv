8491125,4,B00004WL42,"If you like southern style stand-up, you will enjoy the standup bits on this DVD.  The interview with Andy Griffith goes on a bit too long for my taste. If you are a fan of the Andy Griffith show, there better sources out there (I.E. on TBS).  I would have rather seen more stand-up, which is why I bought this DVD.",982368000,12,315,4.147540983606557
