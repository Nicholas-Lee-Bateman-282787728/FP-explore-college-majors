On the DVDs themselves are PDF files with 80 full sized pages of transcriptions with BOTH Standard notation and Tablature. This DVD has 12 great tunes performed and taught by a variety of guitarists. I can't imagine stuffing 80 pages of transcriptions into a DVD case so having it on PDF file (which took a couple minutes to print) was a smart move.

I don't have a DVD player  on my computer, so it is hard to learn the songs without starting and stopping the song on the DVD player.",1158624000,3,501,4.112244897959184
