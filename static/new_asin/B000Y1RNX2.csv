3011382,5,B000Y1RNX2,"...for anyone who loves dogs.  I'm a nanny for two children, ages 5 and 3, and I gave this DVD to one of them as a birthday gift.  They both love it, and so do I!  It's that rare find - a DVD that kids want to watch over and over, and that adults can actually enjoy too.  How can you go wrong with adorable puppies?!",1196640000,4,316,3.742424242424242
3011383,5,B000Y1RNX2,Then you must add this DVD to your collection.  The puppies and their antics are absolutely entertaining to watch.  Each breed has their own description of their unique physical and behavioral characteristics that make this a great learning tool as well.,1194307200,6,254,5.170731707317073
3011384,5,B000Y1RNX2,"My animal-obsessed seven and four year old daughters love puppy party. Even my too-cool 12-year-old step daughter finds it irrisistable. Moms will like puppy party because it's trustworthy television: educational, non-violent, fun, even inspiring. Builds empathy too. My girls help out with pet-duty more after watching this adorable program.",1194220800,7,342,6.0
3011385,5,B000Y1RNX2,Puppy Party delights children and parents as they watch roly poly puppies of all kinds cavort and tumble over one another in this fast moving delightful program suitable for all ages.

3011428,2,B000Y1RNX2,Though I think it's nice to learn about all the different dog/puppy breeds.  My 1.5 year old son didn't hardly watch this dvd the 2 different times I have played it. I only bought this dvd because my child always enjoys seeing the puppies playing in their Animal Party dvd. However the difference here is that they focused more on introducing the different breed of puppies/dogs rather than on showing fun footage of the puppies playing like they did for the Animal Party dvd.  So my child found this one boring. Maybe he'll appreciate when he's much older.,1476489600,,557,4.673469387755102

I had pbs on one day and nature animal odd couples was on and she started barking at the tv lol. So, that sent me on a search for dvds for dogs and this was in my price range so I thought I'd give it a try. Although I thought it was cute unfortunately she was less interested. If it had more animal sounds and a little less narration it may have been great. Still it was fun watching all the pups playing.",1454889600,3,531,3.8363636363636364

It wasn't what I expected but if you don't mind voice overs with your critter antics, it's great.

3011576,1,B000Y1RNX2,I saw this video advertised at the end of a pajaminals video my daughter watches.  She loves dogs (she's 18 months) / but this video is not at all what I thought.

3011578,1,B000Y1RNX2,"For adults trying to select a puppy this is a GREAT video!  For children to watch puppies playing it is a GREAT video!  BUT I bought it hoping it would be all playing and barking BUT it contains maybe three barks and a few other sounds. A great speaker describing the breeds and all you need to know for selecting the right dog.  I bought it for my lonely dog who lost his two best friends both to old age.  I'm getting too old to handle two dogs plus he is an alpha dog so that is tricky.  NO barking.  He did watch the screen a bit but then went to sleep.

I went to YouTube and put in the two words  dogs barking. LOTS of GREAT videos of dogs barking like crazy.  He went NUTS!!!!  And it is free!  There is even one nice fellow who has stuck 50 videos together so just hit play and you get 50 videos non-stop all day of barking, farm animals mooing, clucking, birds chirping - he loved it!!  Almost climbed into the screen to chase the squirrel!  . But mostly dogs barking like crazy.  He has taken my computer from me!  Oops!  I have to get off as he wants YouTube DARK BARKING back again.  I have an old pc I'm going to hook up for him and let it run 12 hours a day or as long as my wife can take it.

So GREAT well done professional video if you are a kid or an adult selecting a dog.  To entertain another dog?  Zero nada zip. There needs to be a DVD of nothing but barking dogs!!!",1390608000,,1389,3.9458483754512637

3011603,5,B000Y1RNX2,"This movie is absolutely the greatest piece of cinematic work ever filmed. I am a 40 year old man and I have seen thousands of movies, but none have been better than this. I've watched Puppy Party Holiday Version at least 75 times. The directing, acting and storyline are unique. I especially love the scenes with the puppies.

One tip: this is the holiday version of Puppy Party. I saw Puppy Party the regular version and thought that was the greatest movie ever made. But then I saw this, and it was equally as good. I do think the holiday version is a tad bit violent for any kidlets under age 8, because in some scenes the puppies fight over a puppy toy. If this concerns you, you could simply fast forward the puppy fight scene or send your kidlet out of the room temporarily. Or get Kitten Party, which may be slightly more appropriate.

3011609,4,B000Y1RNX2,"Whether you are a dog lover or looking to get a dog, Puppy Party is an new, adorable DVD from NCircle Entertainment. It is 70 minutes of dog-filled fun and perfect for both kids and adults. Now I admit it, I am not an animal lover, but I did enjoy this DVD.

Filled with over 25 breeds and hundreds of adorable puppies, the DVD is really jam packed with puppies. There are Heartwarming puppy moments, Hilarious puppy antics, and Puppy Facts about each breed. The DVD is even educational as it gives information about each breed and showcases the dogs.

My youngest son loves this DVD as he loves dogs. Even though he doesn't understand the facts or the different breeds, he cracks up at when the puppies do funny things. I think this DVD would be especially perfect if you are planning on getting a puppy as it would get your child excited or even to put on the TV for your own dog to watch.

I only bought this dvd because my child always enjoys seeing the puppies playing in their Animal Party dvd. However the difference here is that they focused more on introducing the different breed of puppies/dogs rather than on showing fun footage of the puppies playing like they did for the Animal Party dvd.

I'm getting too old to handle two dogs plus he is an alpha dog so that is tricky.  NO barking.  He did watch the screen a bit but then went to sleep.

I went to YouTube and put in the two words  dogs barking. LOTS of GREAT videos of dogs barking like crazy.  He went NUTS!!!!  And it is free!  There is even one nice fellow who has stuck 50 videos together so just hit play and you get 50 videos non-stop all day of barking, farm animals mooing, clucking, birds chirping - he loved it!!  Almost climbed into the screen to chase the squirrel!  . But mostly dogs barking like crazy.  He has taken my computer from me!  Oops!  I have to get off as he wants YouTube DARK BARKING back again.  I have an old pc I'm going to hook up for him and let it run 12 hours a day or as long as my wife can take it.

We use to rent this from RedBox pretty regularly so we decided to just buy it. Kitten Party is next!",1345766400,,387,4.6231884057971016

3246100,5,B000Y1RNX2,"This movie is absolutely the greatest piece of cinematic work ever filmed. I am a 40 year old man and I have seen thousands of movies, but none have been better than this. I've watched Puppy Party Holiday Version at least 75 times. The directing, acting and storyline are unique. I especially love the scenes with the puppies.

One tip: this is the holiday version of Puppy Party. I saw Puppy Party the regular version and thought that was the greatest movie ever made. But then I saw this, and it was equally as good. I do think the holiday version is a tad bit violent for any kidlets under age 8, because in some scenes the puppies fight over a puppy toy. If this concerns you, you could simply fast forward the puppy fight scene or send your kidlet out of the room temporarily. Or get Kitten Party, which may be slightly more appropriate. Or get Kitten Party Holiday Version. Your kidlets will love them all.

If you like puppies, you need to purchase this DVD piece of art ASAP. You won't be disappointed.",1308441600,4,1010,4.454054054054054
3246101,2,B000Y1RNX2,I bought this for my pup because he likes to watch other dogs on tv. Unfortunately... there is just a narrator the whole time and the puppies don't make any noise! No barking or playing noises at all so he quickly lost interest. I wish it had said it was narrated the whole way through!,1297900800,17,286,4.218181818181818

3246106,4,B000Y1RNX2,"Whether you are a dog lover or looking to get a dog, Puppy Party is an new, adorable DVD from NCircle Entertainment. It is 70 minutes of dog-filled fun and perfect for both kids and adults. Now I admit it, I am not an animal lover, but I did enjoy this DVD.

Filled with over 25 breeds and hundreds of adorable puppies, the DVD is really jam packed with puppies. There are Heartwarming puppy moments, Hilarious puppy antics, and Puppy Facts about each breed. The DVD is even educational as it gives information about each breed and showcases the dogs.

My youngest son loves this DVD as he loves dogs. Even though he doesn't understand the facts or the different breeds, he cracks up at when the puppies do funny things. I think this DVD would be especially perfect if you are planning on getting a puppy as it would get your child excited or even to put on the TV for your own dog to watch. (My mother-in-law leaves the TV on for her dog.) It really is a cute DVD and for the price you can't beat it!",1262131200,31,1001,4.2631578947368425
