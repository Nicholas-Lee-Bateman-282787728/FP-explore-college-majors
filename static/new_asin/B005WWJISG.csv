4899997,3,B005WWJISG,"Jury please I'm not going down for nobody..... I'm not snitching, but hey I'm not about to play the law to help anyone. The dialogue was a lil slow at first, but let's just say if your my nemesis I will not let you give me a drink of any kind! Overall this movie could have use something that pop. It was okay!",1331596800,,310,3.9365079365079363
4899998,2,B005WWJISG,I got the movie to see Bryce and the beautiful house it was filmed in .I am acquainted with him and the owner of the house. I was disappointed in the movie.,1331596800,,156,3.90625

8488153,3,B005WWJISG,"This movie started off slow. In the beginning of the movie there was fighting and drinking. And then some words are exchanged and then we go to another party where there is drinking. A poem is read and there is a rape and drugs involved. The guy is so mad that he kills one of the guys he used to be friends with when he learns he raped his fianc soon to be wife. I'm not going to tell the rest of the story because I hate spoiling the end for the ones that have not seen it. But I will say the ending was a good twist but this could have been a really good movie if it had more of a plot to it. It started off really slow and there were a lot of images which was good. Images are good in a movie and people hate a lot of talking in movies without there being some symbolism in it. But the images have to have symbolism and meaning behind it and be connected to the words spoken in the movie. But overall, I would say the movie is the best toward the end. But I kind of which the director would have told more of a story instead of just trying to get a good twist at the end. I which there would have been both elements to make the film more impactful and I kind of which the director would make a sequel. Because he really did have a really good twist at the end that could produce a sequel. But overall I was able to watch the movie and did like the ending. If I had to do it all over I would buy the movie again but I wish there was more to it than the drinking and fighting in the movie. But you will still be able to watch this movie it just won't be a movie that you can watch over and over.",1456790400,,1597,3.8132530120481927

8488156,3,B005WWJISG,"Low budget movie...some of the actors were very robotic, a few were believable. I did not see the ending coming like that. Worth watching the one time, though",1368835200,,158,4.678571428571429
8488157,5,B005WWJISG,I wonder why this movie was not in the theater's. This is as good or better than a lot of movie flops that do make it to the big screen.,1367193600,,136,3.566666666666667

8488159,5,B005WWJISG,I liked this movie. It had a plot. I knew some of the actors and they were good. The ending was bananas. Anyone who didn't like this movie is a hater! lol It was good. Give it a try. You might like it.;-) xoxo,1340668800,,209,3.772727272727273
8488160,4,B005WWJISG,"This was clearly low-budget, but the storyline kept my interest.  Vic, a nasty and conniving runner, sought to terrorize his former girlfriend into coming back to him and destroy his buddy's relationship with his fiancee by destroying her.  Wow.  Gotta give it to Bryce Wilson...he can play subdued evil to the hilt.  His motto, ""Divide and conquer"", seemed to be his unholy grail to getting back at those who he felt wronged him.  Just when I thought it was all over, the ending hit me in the face like a ton of bricks!  I don't know if there is going to be a ""JURY"" the sequel or not.  Personally, I don't forsee it, so I won't go on for fear of spilling the ending.  A movie with some merit, if you can get past some of the other stuff, like the stilted acting from some of the players and the cinematography, which was a little dark for me.",1340582400,,844,4.2974683544303796
8488161,3,B005WWJISG,Was looking forward to seeing this movie. Was very disappointed. This movie could have and should have been much better. It was just above low budget with the acting and flow. Some of the actors seemed so robotic with their acting and lines which took away from the quality of the movie and made it hard to watch.,1336262400,,313,4.413793103448276
8488162,4,B005WWJISG,"A class reunion of below 30's gorgeous youngsters who can't act winds up with one of them  murdered by another. Naturally, calling the police is out of the question.  So now what do  they do?  Well the women are so beautiful that for a long time you just stare at them. That's occasionally for rather long periods, but keeps you from concentrating on the acting or the words of the inane dialogue. Plus it's Puritanical too.  There is lot of sex happening, we think, since all of the actors who've spent years working out to become physically perfect specimens are rewarded with  50's fadeouts or  fully clothed lovemaking.  Otherwise, Jury of Our Peers  was fun to watch and I enjoyed it a lot.  Warning: the expectation of movie content from the title will not be realized.  Any trial scene and verdict seems to have been deleted (and abruptly too) from the final cut.  There is only one sentence in the movie referencing any trial or verdict.  The end is a big surprise until you think back over the murder.  ""OF Course that one did it,""  you'll say.  But then why didn't you figure it out back then.  That's what makes this such a fun film.  Again, black film producers, a little more skin  is always  appreciated in these sex movies.  The lighting is fairly good for the night takes. This is  too often a problem for the audiences when when it  filming darker skinned actors.  The sound track was well integrated into the film if one goes for this tuneless hip hop stuff. 4 stars.
