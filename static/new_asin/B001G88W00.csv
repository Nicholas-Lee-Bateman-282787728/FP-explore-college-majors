It shows how a poor family - a widow with 2 children are struggling in a poor village. The drama is set in Georgia between 19 and beginning of 20th centuries. The poor family makes the ends meet by selling yogurt, which Magdana (the widow-mother) takes to the town market every morning and makes small money, enough to barely feed her orphan children.

Once, in their mother's absence, the children - six-year-old Mikho and three-year-old Kato - found an abandoned donkey on a road leading to their village. They took care of him and named him ""Lurdja"", which means ""blue-eyed"". Surrounded by love and care, the donkey became a big help in the poor household. But as it always happens - poor man's luck doesn't last long... In the end they lose the donkey, they're taken to court by a man with money, who the donkey originally belonged to, but was abandoned and thrown on the road to die. The corrupt judge rules the case in the rich man's favor. So, the poor family loses the donkey...

Good quality DVD, though it's a black and white movie. Nice picture, and nice sound!

I'd recommend it to watch!",1255392000,4,1145,4.598039215686274
