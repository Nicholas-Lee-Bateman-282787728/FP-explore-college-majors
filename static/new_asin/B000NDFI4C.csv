2765608,2,B000NDFI4C,I was a little dissapointed in  this item.  It was a very general outline of weight loss and not the detailed information I had hoped for.,1202515200,3,138,4.269230769230769
2765609,5,B000NDFI4C,"Dr. Roizen has presented the key to a better looking, better feeling, fit and healthy body which can add years to your life depending on how closely you stick to this lifestyle change.  This is not a diet.  It's about making better choices in your diet; trading white bread for brown and fruit in place of cake and cookies.  All the information is there, with an explanation of how our bodies age and why we need to make these changes; why we fell hunger and how to turn it off naturally.
He has presented this information in a clear, concise and simple manner. This is no expensive diet or a gym membership, it is just good common sense food choices and a short exercise regime that anyone can do in his or her  home.
No fluff or filler here, just pure Dr. Roizen...look at him if you have any doubt.",1192752000,31,801,4.32

8177196,5,B000NDFI4C,"The video by Dr Rozen is good, but the workout section is great!  I have owned over 25 different exercise videos and think this is the best ever!  I tried to find this portion of the dvd as a seperate dvd but could not.
I think Tracy Hafen should make her own DVD.  I would buy it in a heartbeat!",1358726400,,296,3.9
8177197,5,B000NDFI4C,Dr. Roizen provides some of the best health wize information you can use.  Becoming healthy is not as difficult to achieve as we'd like to make it.  It will take some effort on our part to break old habits.  This video was resourceful.  I received it in excellent condition.,1294531200,,274,4.530612244897959
8177198,5,B000NDFI4C,"Dr. Oz starts by explaining what our Omentum is - the fat in our belly.  He shows an omentum - a yellow, slimey piece of goo - and it hits home that is what is on top of the waistline.  He doesn't use scare tactics, he's actually quite friendly and encouraging, but he does tell it like it is.

He then moves into the steps that people need to take to lose their omentum and bring their bodies into the most efficient machines that they can be.  He uses quizes and audience participation to keep the subject matter moving.

They go over what foods to avoid all togeteher - to absolutely get rid of and at first it is overwhelming to think that you have to literally start over, but with the audience examples of success, it's encouraging and hopeful that you too can be healthy.  He stresses that everyone needs to walk a minimun of half hour a day no matter waht and explains why.

There are books and a website that goes along with the DVD - but it's a great way to jumpstart the world that is Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen.  He's a great speaker and seems like a smart doctor that backs up his information with facts and time tested research.

I've watched a few times and sent a copy to my sister as well.  Now, if I could only get my husband to watch it!",1233705600,2,1251,4.153526970954357
8177199,5,B000NDFI4C,"The things discussed just make so much sense, yet it is good to have them reiterated from time to time.

Straightforwad sound advice about keeping mind the little things that can help you maintain your weight and health.  Vegatablle, fruits, not eating as many fatty foods.  When combining these things together, along with exercise, it is easier to maintain weight and health while not feeling starved or ""on a diet.""

I like the feeling that I am not punishing myself but am being kind to myself.

Pick this up and one or two of the books in the series and you will feel better.",1220745600,2,580,4.538461538461538

8177201,5,B000NDFI4C,"This book should be read by all. This is NOT a diet in the modern sense rather a way to eat that WILL cause weight loss and more importantly better health. I was on the South Beach Diet, which is very similar to this one, but this book is more informative about fat and the effects on the body. Both my wife and I have had great success from a health prospective. In 4 weeks my wife who is a type 2 diabetic, was taking the maximum dosage of 2 different meds for the diabetis has completely gotten off one of them and reduced the amount she takes of the other.
I was on a high blood pressure med and could not get below 130/95 on the meds. I don't take the meds anymore and have a consistant 118/70 BP. Weight loss has been ok, waist loss (more important) has been steady.
Do the refridgerator cleaning and follow as closely as possible the food recogmendations. No hydrogenated oils, limit beef and other high saturated fats sources,sugar and avoid ""prepared"" foods without reading lables. Most use hydrogenated oil of some type.

Good luck, See ya on the trail!!

PS Thanks Dr Roizen and Oz",1204588800,9,1092,4.374384236453202
