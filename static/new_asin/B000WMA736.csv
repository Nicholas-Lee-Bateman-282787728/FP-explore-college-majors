2985485,5,B000WMA736,"The Marva Collins Story is another example of an excellent made for television film (a film that probably cost very little to make and needed no expensive special effects or razzle dazzle) that brings a true story to the attention of the public.  Such quality television films reminds me once again of the broad variety of material that can make it on to the small screen, when the cinema fare is much more limited in scope.

  The film chronicles how Marva Collins, a highly dedicated public school teacher in an inner city Chicago school, gave up the security of her teaching position to start her own private school.  Frustrated by the apathy and low standards of her colleagues and the obstructiveness of the public school bureaucracy, and horrified by the related poor performance of so many of the students, Collins opened a school where she could carry out her own teaching philosophy.  Collins believed that children should be taught and challenged by the best material in history, literature, languages, math, and science.  This approach is called a classical education, the idea that the greatest accomplishments of Western civilization, the civilization that gave rise to our own country, are the common heritage of all.  Collins also had a fierce love for her students, who were mostly African-American children from poorer families.  This love manifested itself in a commitment and determination to their education that brooked no obstacles.

  Supported by her loving husband, but otherwise without any real financial or institutional support, Collins put together a successful school where she could demonstrate that poor black children, some of whom had been struggling in other school systems, could master great literature, foreign languages, persuasive composition, and above all, the best ideas of the past.

  The film is well-acted, with Cicely Tyson in the lead role, supported by a youngish Morgan Freeman as her husband.  The supporting actors who play the children and other adults are also excellent, bringing a realistic and sometimes humorous tone to the domestic and schoolroom scenes.

  Marva Collins went on to become extremely influential in the educational reform movement, contributing to the rise of private and charter schools that regrouped around high standards, high expectations, and high quality content.  There has also been a renewed interest among many Americans in classical education, for which Marva Collins deserves great credit.  While her own school unfortunately closed down during the economic recession of 2008-2009, her influence on the many children she taught as well as many more who were blessed by her inspiring example to the private, charter, and homeschooling movements has been profound.

  Although the film only introduces the viewer to her wonderful life work and does not extend beyond the initial success of her school, it is well worth seeing.  Highly recommended.",1329350400,6,2935,5.287257019438445
2985486,4,B000WMA736,"Yes, the movie was very good.  I am a follower of Marva Collins, who I consider the greatest teacher of our time.  I only wish the DVD came with an interview of the real Marva Collins, or at the least, a copy of the TV 60 Minutes story which is only 15 minutes long.

Also, if the DVD came had a Spanish option, it would reach a lot more who need to hear her message.

I also highly recommend her book where she and a co-author tell it like it is.

She is as great as Martin Luther King Jr.  Both state that skin is not the issue, but the content of one's character which Marva Collins pinpoints with success.

God bless them both.",1318723200,6,631,4.040322580645161

2985498,5,B000WMA736,"This is a must-watch for just about anyone.  It's a very inspiring true story that makes you want to cheer or cry or both!  Watch by yourself to see what determination can produce.  Watch it with your kids to show them the power of independent thinking and learning beyond the basics.  And watch it with a loved one/partner to show what support for one another can bring.

For everyone, this is a marvelous example of how your beliefs shape your reality.  When one woman wouldn't accept the conventional wisdom of her time and place and instead followed her own, she changed the world for countless children and their families.

Yes, this made-for-TV production is not as impressive as a full-up theater production.  But passionate acting by Cicely Tyson with a good supporting cast will tug at your heartstrings and stir your hopes for the next generation.  Buy it, and share it with everyone in your family!",1264291200,8,909,4.7756410256410255

Unfortunatly ""touching, patting, kissing on the cheek or contact of any kind"" would be grounds for dismissal.  I am not a teacher but use Marva's principles on the people I work with, my family and even my dogs.  I don't have children, but if I did, I would use her teaching method on them as well.  This is an EXCELLENT story and insight on how to ""connect"" with children.  If you have the opportunity to see this movie it will better your life in so many ways.  You really need to watch Marva's style and how she gets across to her students.  It will be worth your while and be a movie you'll never forget.",1241568000,11,692,4.276923076923077

She demonstrates what our schools could really achieve with all children if we could attract and keep highly talented and dedicated teachers and then get the bureaucrats and standardized tests out of the way.

3219982,5,B000WMA736,"The Marva Collins Story is another example of an excellent made for television film (a film that probably cost very little to make and needed no expensive special effects or razzle dazzle) that brings a true story to the attention of the public.  Such quality television films reminds me once again of the broad variety of material that can make it on to the small screen, when the cinema fare is much more limited in scope.

  The film chronicles how Marva Collins, a highly dedicated public school teacher in an inner city Chicago school, gave up the security of her teaching position to start her own private school.  Frustrated by the apathy and low standards of her colleagues and the obstructiveness of the public school bureaucracy, and horrified by the related poor performance of so many of the students, Collins opened a school where she could carry out her own teaching philosophy.  Collins believed that children should be taught and challenged by the best material in history, literature, languages, math, and science.  This approach is called a classical education, the idea that the greatest accomplishments of Western civilization, the civilization that gave rise to our own country, are the common heritage of all.  Collins also had a fierce love for her students, who were mostly African-American children from poorer families.  This love manifested itself in a commitment and determination to their education that brooked no obstacles.

  Supported by her loving husband, but otherwise without any real financial or institutional support, Collins put together a successful school where she could demonstrate that poor black children, some of whom had been struggling in other school systems, could master great literature, foreign languages, persuasive composition, and above all, the best ideas of the past.

  The film is well-acted, with Cicely Tyson in the lead role, supported by a youngish Morgan Freeman as her husband.  The supporting actors who play the children and other adults are also excellent, bringing a realistic and sometimes humorous tone to the domestic and schoolroom scenes.

  Marva Collins went on to become extremely influential in the educational reform movement, contributing to the rise of private and charter schools that regrouped around high standards, high expectations, and high quality content.  There has also been a renewed interest among many Americans in classical education, for which Marva Collins deserves great credit.  While her own school unfortunately closed down during the economic recession of 2008-2009, her influence on the many children she taught as well as many more who were blessed by her inspiring example to the private, charter, and homeschooling movements has been profound.

  Although the film only introduces the viewer to her wonderful life work and does not extend beyond the initial success of her school, it is well worth seeing.  Highly recommended.",1329350400,6,2935,5.287257019438445
3219983,4,B000WMA736,"Yes, the movie was very good.  I am a follower of Marva Collins, who I consider the greatest teacher of our time.  I only wish the DVD came with an interview of the real Marva Collins, or at the least, a copy of the TV 60 Minutes story which is only 15 minutes long.

Also, if the DVD came had a Spanish option, it would reach a lot more who need to hear her message.

I also highly recommend her book where she and a co-author tell it like it is.

She is as great as Martin Luther King Jr.  Both state that skin is not the issue, but the content of one's character which Marva Collins pinpoints with success.

God bless them both.",1318723200,6,631,4.040322580645161

3219995,5,B000WMA736,"This is a must-watch for just about anyone.  It's a very inspiring true story that makes you want to cheer or cry or both!  Watch by yourself to see what determination can produce.  Watch it with your kids to show them the power of independent thinking and learning beyond the basics.  And watch it with a loved one/partner to show what support for one another can bring.

For everyone, this is a marvelous example of how your beliefs shape your reality.  When one woman wouldn't accept the conventional wisdom of her time and place and instead followed her own, she changed the world for countless children and their families.

Yes, this made-for-TV production is not as impressive as a full-up theater production.  But passionate acting by Cicely Tyson with a good supporting cast will tug at your heartstrings and stir your hopes for the next generation.  Buy it, and share it with everyone in your family!",1264291200,8,909,4.7756410256410255

I wonder why there are so many amazing stories attached to Chicago. An excellent addition to my so called ""black movie"" collection. Good family movie in which you might need a box of kleenex to get through it's 102 minutes. The chemistry between Tyson and Freedman magnificent, they both look so young I think the movie originally came out in 1981. Great acting jobs by two superstars; the child actors and actresses were wonderful as well.",1261526400,,576,5.073684210526316

3219999,5,B000WMA736,"If only the teachers of today could use the method of teaching Marva Collins used.  Unfortunatly ""touching, patting, kissing on the cheek or contact of any kind"" would be grounds for dismissal.  I am not a teacher but use Marva's principles on the people I work with, my family and even my dogs.  I don't have children, but if I did, I would use her teaching method on them as well.  This is an EXCELLENT story and insight on how to ""connect"" with children.  If you have the opportunity to see this movie it will better your life in so many ways.  You really need to watch Marva's style and how she gets across to her students.  It will be worth your while and be a movie you'll never forget.",1241568000,11,692,4.276923076923077

We need to go back to some basis and learn to incorporate both the classical learning and with modern learning.  I sure wish I had teacher like that, and I had one who taught Social Studies and she was amazing and she also was a nun.  What I like the most, was she brought out that the school system back then has been failing, and also she prove children can learn across the board in the right setting.  I also saw the interview and it was remarkable.  Wonderful movie and I just finish watching it again.  Also there is another movie based on true story  Son Rise with Love.
