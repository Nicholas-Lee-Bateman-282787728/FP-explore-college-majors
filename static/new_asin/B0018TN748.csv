8271166,1,B0018TN748,"Embassy Home Entertainment has released a series of Bulldog Drummond double features on vhs. They are very good-looking prints from the Janus Collection. WHY, OH WHY can't they release them on DVD? Who currently has the right to release the Janus prints? I bought the Embassy vhs series and made my own DVD-R's because the Alpha Home Video series is unwatchable! The video quality of these films is the worst I've ever seen from Alpha (and that's saying a lot). The Embassy vhs's are available on AMAZON at the time of this posting.",1425600000,4,532,4.731182795698925
8271167,2,B0018TN748,"Perhaps we should just be grateful that these nine rare titles are available.  Then again, ""minimally happy"" seems more apropriate.  Sound quality is O.K. on all titles, however picture quality leaves much to be desired.  It appears as though the source material came from one of the old time 16 MM ""basement dupers"".  Fuzzy picture, washed out faces, poor contrast, etc.  Had I been aware of the very poor picture quality, I probably would have passed.  But, coming from Alpha Video, I should have been forewarned.  They are just like a box of chocolates (you never know what you'll get).  So, I remain ""minimally happy"" yours; Don Kruse, Memphis.",1313452800,13,648,4.8807339449541285

These are all fun B-mystery films starring John Howard as Bulldog Drummond in all but the first of the series, which stars Ray Milland. In all but the last film, E.E. Clive is the model of efficiency as Drummond's gentleman's gentleman. He even has a gun ready when Drummond finds the need for one but has none on hand. Reginald Denny is great fun as Drummond's faithful if inept friend, Algie. Finally, there is the appearance of John Barrymore in a couple of films as Inspector Neilsen of Scotland Yard. Barrymore still projected quite a screen presence even as the end neared for him.

So, if I like these so much, why am I giving the set 2/5 stars? Because they are public domain films with extremely variable audio and video quality. The first of the series, ""Bulldog Drummond Escapes"", has such darkened video and bad audio that it is impossible to hear quiet conversation between the players and in many cases see what is going on. If you want to see these films, and they are fun, buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>. For a fraction of the cost you get all of these films with the exception of ""Arrest Bulldog Drummond"" and ""Bulldog Drummond's Bride"", plus 44 other great public domain mysteries.",1215907200,43,3362,5.5984251968503935
