3610878,2,B001GEJY1A,This is a really BAD home made cheapo reproduction. The disk arrived loose in case with scratches on it caused during shipment. Put it in new JVC dvd player to see what it would look like anyway. It is almost unviewable & the sound is terrible. There are very bright white highlights around the images which are common with home made unsophisticated copy attempts. I do not recommend this particular copy of The Sword & the Dragon to anyone. This review is no reflection on Amazon as they are not responsible for the poor quality of this product. I have bought many products from Amazon & all have been excellent. Unfortunately this product is not up to par & whoever made it should be ashamed. I do not recommend Mad Phat videos to anyone.,1315872000,,740,4.529850746268656
3610879,4,B001GEJY1A,"Admittedly, this film is a bit hokey, but it tells the story of a larger-than-life character.  I enjoy it, because I like some melodrama once in a while, and this film certainly supplies it.  The film itself is a bit jerky in spots because whoever did the dubbing didn't do too good a job, which is why I gave it only four stars.  As far as the story goes, it's an old Russian folk tale about Ilya Muromets, one of their heroes of the past.  The story is fairly well told, though as I've noted it gets a bit hokey in spots.  I have to say they did a great job casting the villains in this movie.  The leader of the Tugars, an Edward G. Robinson-type character named Kalin, is not at all a nice guy, and his stooge in the castle is a real scuzz ball.  All in all, it's a nice folk tale, complete with good guys, bad guys, and a real live fire breathing dragon.  (Yeah, right!)  Still, it's worth at least a liter bottle of pop and a bowl of chips.  What's more, it IS enjoyable.",1300147200,,977,4.094736842105263
3610880,4,B001GEJY1A,"I very much enjoyed viewing this movie and will do so again and again.  It's a movie I saw when it came out around 1960 and never forgot.  Also I never though that I would find and own it.  This experience is valuable to me because it provided another resource.  Neither Turner Classic Movies or Movies Unlimited have this movie in their library and it was so good finding out that I could get it from your source.  The quality of the movie, especially considering its age, is very good and I am pleased with the price and the rapidity of delivery.  I look forward to ordering from you again.",1265241600,,592,4.336363636363636
3610881,1,B001GEJY1A,"""The Sword and the Dragon"" is the American edition of the Russian film ""Ilya Muromets"" directed by Ptushko.  It is based upon the byliny, oral epic poems collected in the 19th Century that go back to the time of Kievan Rus.  In that respect, it is similar to the Finnish Kalevala.

Reviewers of the film are generally harsh in their criticisms, ranging from the storyline itself, through the quality of the acting, to the naivitee of the special effects.

Let me first say that the special effects are pretty bad, even for a pre-Star Wars film, and you have to be willing to accept that.  Ray Harryhausen was doing vastly superior work at roughly the same time.  But on the other hand, just remember the many B rated Japanese Sci-Fi efforts from that period as well.

As to the story, it helps to understand both the virtues and the limitations of the film if you know the poems upon which it is based.  Some of the film's plot derives from songs about Ilya, where Invincor=Sviatogor the giant, the wind demon=Solovey the Nightingale Robber, Prince Vandar=Vladimir II the Sun Prince, the Tugar emissary=Idolische, etc.  Some of it derives from byliny about other heroes, e.g., the rescue of the Princess from a dragon derives from a poem about Dobrynia Nikitisch.

As with other efforts to turn old literary epics into films such as the recent rash of Beowulf movies, or for that matter even modern literature such as H.P. Lovecraft's stories, there is always going to be some problems in trying to combine and adapt diverse elements from one format into another.

When you know the original material, it helps better to appreciate these difficulties.  Read some of the Russian byliny and watch this film in its original Russian version as ""Ilya Muromets"", and it wears better.

That brings me to this particular DVD issuance of ""The Sword and the Dragon"".

Back in the late eighties and early nineties, United Home Video produced a VHS tape version of the film which, while not perfect, is vastly superior to the present DVD.  The VHS had good imaging and color saturation, and lacked all the scratches and pops etc. that plague this DVD.  The DVD text says something about this copy being derived from Video Yesteryear, but the abysmal quality of it suggests that, whatever the source, this is a badly made unauthorized copy.

Furthermore, the Russians have come out with an absolutely terrific DVD version of the original ""Ilya Muromets"" film available from MOSFILM.  If you want this film on DVD, get the Russian ""Ilya"", and forget this dismal ""Sword"".

For those of you who, like me, still want a copy on DVD of the American version of ""Sword"", out of pure nostalgia if nothing else, hold off until a better copy of ""Sword"" becomes available.  Maybe with a little urging United will come up with one.

P.S.  It would be nice to also see the Mystery Science Theatre spoof on this film.

Also, for those interested in this type of film, note that ""Sadko"", a Russian film also based on the byliny, which was distributed in America under the title ""The Magic Voyage of Sindbad"", is available in both its Russian version and its American version (double-billed with ""The Day the Earth Froze"") on excellent DVDs.  It too was spoofed on Mystery Science Theatre.

3610882,1,B001GEJY1A,"""The Sword and the Dragon"" is a late-'50s Russian-made film about a semi-legendary warrior-hero of medieval Kiev, which was dubbed into English and theatrically released in the US in the early '60s and much later sold here as a good-quality VHS tape, which I enjoyed. So when I saw it become available on Amazon.com as a DVD, and after reading the (then) only favorable review, I bought it.

BIG MISTAKE.

This copy of ""The Sword and the Dragon"" is technically so bad it is almost unwatchable, and paying what's ordinarily a full-price for a premium DVD makes it a Total Ripoff!

It looks like whoever made this DVD apparently got hold of an old REAL beat-up movie-reels version, projected it, filmed it close-up with a generally unfocused video camera, dubbed it ""as is"" onto a DVD --and then somehow got Amazon.com to itself offer copies at a premium price, without any attached warning as to its ultra-poor technical quality.

There is NO editing or digital ""cleaning"" or ""restoration"" whatsoever of the re-filmed movie. The color varies literally from minute to minute, occassionally blazing so brilliantly it strains the eyes, but too much more often bleaching out to shades of palest pastels and even B&W. Moreover, the camera is semi-focused closely onto the dead-center of what was a widescreen movie, so if someone is somewhat off to the side and talking --or fighting the dragon!--we don't see that person --maybe just a hand! And if all that's not enough to tickle your funny bone, wait til you see the very-visible ""scratches"" and hear the sound ""hiccups"" throughout the film!

""Distracting"" is too nice a word to describe the many many technical flaws only too visible in this copy of what was a decent ""action-hero-oldie"" in the style of the now-classic Steve Reeve's ""Hercules"" movies or the best of the Italian ""Spaghetti Westerns""! But Amazon's ""review"" policy won't let us use more appropriate words, so I'll just add a caveat:

If you buy this version, You've Been Forewarned: at the very best, IT'S A RIPOFF!  Even at 1/10th the price.",1227052800,,2055,4.887931034482759
3610883,1,B001GEJY1A,"When I first read the one and only review regarding this Russian DVD, I was really expecting another movie in the caliber of Lord of the Rings, as described by the only raviewer.  Not so folks!  this has to be the biggest rip-off I have ever encountered.  The so-called color movie is mostly a washed out black and white, rare hints of color, scratches like a 20's movie, and certainly alien to the caliber of a 60s movie.  The acting is absolutely amateur.  I have filed a request to Amazon to accept my return of the DVD and refund my money due to a misleading description and review.  From past experience, I'm sure Amazon will honor this and hopefully they'll pull the other review after they look at my returned DVD.  Seriously Folks!! I have purchased several hundred DVDs from Amazon during the last few years and this is by far the worst I have ever seen sold with the accompanying misleading description/review.  I had purchased from Amazon the Russian DVD ""War and Peace"" which is absolutely magnificent in color and production, and expected this caliber from the description and review of ""Sword and the Dragon"".  NOT! Seriously....this is a piece of junk!!!!!",1226966400,,1171,4.729064039408867
3610884,5,B001GEJY1A,"Sword and the Dragon what a monster movie, figurativley and literally.
This Russian movie made in 1959 during the cold war was contoverial because of geopolotical tensions. However hollywood producer Sig Shore who produced the blacksploitation movie Super Fly in 1973 took a risk in promoting this soviet fantasy movie,  at a time when some hollywood producers were being black balled for being suspected communist sympathizers.

This is among the greatest fantasy movies ever made in its powerful portrayal of a spernatural medieval war between good and evil, and features a cast of thousands with special effects and weird creatures that to this day rivals the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is a highly valued movie experience that will leave the viewer awestruck.",1223856000,,768,5.185483870967742

good after viewing it cause its the old Good againt  Evil subject and good
does win at the end.
After seeing the vhs version you can see that its not widescreen and boy
do you miss a lot. So i found my old tv copy from 15 years ago when it
played on tv and its also in that Ratio.
So i just ordered the DVD as there is one out there that will provide
you with a widescreen version so one can see the movie as it was supposed
to be seen....The only drawback is that its in russian with subtittles.. Cant wait..",1201478400,,651,3.8947368421052633

3610888,5,B001GEJY1A,"This is the story of Ilya Morometz.  Ilya's an alright guy, but his legs won't work for some reason.  He can only watch helplessly while his beloved country is plundered by a Mongolian race known as the Tugars.  Then, one day, his life is changed forever.  Some strangers visit his house and give him a special kind of dew to drink that restores his legs to full health once again.  Ilya celebrates by rooting up large tree stumps and throwing them off a cliff.  He tells his parents he'd like to work on the farm again but he has to stop those dog gone Tugars first.

So Ilya sets out to destroy all the Tugars.  After mounting his mighty steed, Chestnut Gray, he neglects the roads that lead to riches and a wife, and instead sets out on the road that leads to death.  He defeats a wind demon and takes the demon back to the prince of his land.  The prince gives Ilya a ring for conquering the demon, and so Ilya is on the prince's good side.  But not for long...

You see, there are traitors in the palace whose loyalty is with the Tugars.  They tell the prince horrible lies about Ilya and the prince is...well...kind of gullible.  He orders Ilya to be locked in a dungeon, but to be fed well.  The sneaky traitors disobey the prince and won't even give Ilya a scrap of food.  Ilya only survives with the help of a magic blanket his wife made for him.  It has a picture of a tree on it that somehow is able to grow real fruit.  It's a miracle!

When the traitors are discovered and Ilya is freed from prison, he comes up with a very complicated plan to stop the Tugars.  To this day I still have no idea what Ilya's plan was.  I guess it doesn't really matter though.  He and his men kill the three-headed dragon of the Tugars and save the kingdom of the prince.  The prince invites Ilya to become a noble or something, but Ilya declines and tells the prince to accept his son as a noble instead.  I believe the last line of the film is, ""We shall be proud to have with us the son of Ilya Morometz!""  Awesome movie.",1160870400,,2019,4.1953125

Yes, I've read the criticisms about this DVD being a very old print of the film, that the color was faded for the first half of its 82 minutes but my wanting to see it again outweighed anything critical that I'd read. Dubbed into English for this American release, the original Russian film, ""I l y a M u r o m e t s"" was actually made four years earlier. This film was a part of my childhood and I just had to see it again. Based on a Russian folk tale children, this film chronicles I l y A's rise to prominence in Kiev during the Merle Ages and his lesion to lead soldiers loyal to their Prince to battle the hordes of T u g a r s (Tartars) and also to face their final weapon of destruction, a three-headed fire-breathing dragon!
