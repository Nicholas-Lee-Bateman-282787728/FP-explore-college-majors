Shot completely on location in New Orleans, Louisiana, this film is a perfect blend of classic 50's camp tied with contemporary humor.  Hints of such classic slapstick such as the Three Stooges line up with quips and gags that would make Kevin Smith proud.

The story is led by a strong cast as well.  Derek Fogarty is the adorable geek that will have all the girls rooting for him, Travis Resor is one to watch as a loveable jock (yes, he plays a big, mean jock, but c'mon, he's loveable), and Jessica Ratiff is hilarious as the popular girl with a hidden geek side that's just dying to come out.....literally!

If you're looking for a fun way to spend your evening or looking to add to your queue for upcoming Halloween parties, this film is a must-have for any horror/comedy fan!",1316995200,3,1013,4.443243243243243
