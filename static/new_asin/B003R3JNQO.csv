At Cross Academy there are two classes the day class for humans and the night class made up of all vampires, the human girls openly drool over the sexy male vamps and each day pile up outside to see them like fan girls with a rock star

Yuuki Cross the adopted daughter of the head master has a strange connection to the gorgeous Kaname the secret is slowly revealed  leading up to very interesting events that have taken place in the past and shed a whole new light on the mysterious kaname. Zero a also has a connection Yuuki and Kaname from childhood after his parents vampire hunters were killed by a pure blood revenge seeking Shizuka after they took the life of her human lover

Zero is then bitten by the vengeful vampiress, his twin brother is taken with her surprisingly she keeps him with her like a relative. Zero is taken in by Yuuki's father he and Yuuki grow close fast. when he first meets Kaname on one of his vistts to Yuuki Zero tries to stab him with a silver knife. It is revealed that when she was a child Kaname saved Yuuki from a bad vampire trying to kill her. As time passes it becomes a daily battle for Zero to keep his vampiric half restrained. This has episodes 5 to 8. [ Vampire Knight Guilty ] the series that picks up where [ Vampire Knight ] left off is amazing and gives detailed episodes leading up to an exciting conclusion like the first one it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, that set has a total of 13 episodes as well",1402876800,,1670,4.261829652996846
