8623502,1,B000MPPVT8,"I was very excited to find a set of both Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 but now wish I'd have saved my $$$$ or spent it on another guitar instructional book or DVD.  I really enjoy Glenn Kaiser's playing style both his blues and especially his earlier Resurrection Band work...but this DVD DOESN'T DELIVER THE GOODS.  THE GOOD: You get Glenn going over the VERY BASICS of numerous instruments and electronics (acoustic & electric guitar, harmonicas, dobros, amps, mics, switches, etc.,) and why certain brands or makes are his personal favorites.  He shares some good insight to his inspiration from the Lord when it comes to songwriting and singing.  You know where his heart lies and Glenn plays a few tunes on various instruments.  THE BAD:  There's really NO INSTRUCTION whatsoever for any of his work or songs, he alludes to you finding your own sound/tone and style and never really tries to teach you or walk through any song or share his techniques which was VERY DISAPPOINTING.  He alludes to one's TONE and to the BEND (bending strings / notes) for both guitar and harmonica several times as the meat that separates the men from the boys or the master musician from the novice. Glenn, you could have done much better.

OVERALL:  As for me, I've been playing guitar and harmonica (some keyboard, banjo, dobro, and ukelee)  since I was a teen (I'm now almost 50) so I'm fairly well rounded as a guitar player and musician.  I thought this would be like paying for several personal lessons from the man himself and was excited waiting to get and watch these dvd's, instead it was like going to a music store and getting someone to break down instruments pros/cons before making a sales pitch which anyone with a love of instruments has already done with there own two feet. Had the retail cost of these had been half of what it is this would have been a good value, at their current price, there cost too much for what you get.  There's really not much replay value once you watch these once, you won't find yourself going back to learn more, at least I didn't.

SAVE YOUR MONEY or go to a TAB site that someone else had tried to share some of Glenn's work or just start playing lps/tapes/cds over and over again and try to learn it yourself.  I've always hoped Glenn would release a authenic TAB book for some of his ealier work with Resurrection band and then a separate book for his GKB bandwork (It's not to late Glenn!)",1268092800,,2416,4.5368663594470044
