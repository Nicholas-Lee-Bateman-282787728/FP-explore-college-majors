3823963,5,B001W4KPQM,"Gary Sparrow, a young, married service engineer accidentally discovers a time portal into back into Blitz-torn 1940s London; a portal only he can use. His hum-drum life is injected with excitement and new romance as lives the lie of being a secret agent in the past. All this sets the scene for all kinds of mishap, as Gary becomes more and more involved in his other life, and has to juggle two lives, and eventually two wives, without arousing the suspicions of his 1990s wife. An array of regular characters bring charm to this journey into nostaligia where the time-travel aspect also allows for a comparison between the morals and ideas of the 1940s and 1990s. If you are a fan of British comedy, then you simply must see this charming series. I hope that there will be a US-compatible version out soon.",1280361600,2,808,4.6573426573426575
3823964,5,B001W4KPQM,"In the United States, we all so loved this series.  We viewed it on public television sometime ago.  The concept was so creative and the show a complete delight.  BBC if somehow this comes to your attention, PLEASE, PLEASE release this on Region 1 format for purchase of complete series.  You'll find quite a market here in the U.S.

3823965,5,B001W4KPQM,"This program was broadcast on public television in the 1990s.  For some very strange reason, the BBC has not released it for sale in the video format compatible with players in the USA (Ntsc format).  Why... I can't imagine, since it is one of the best British comedy series ever.  Very entertaining.  I usually don't even like time-travel plots.  And certainly a story premise in which a man cheats on his wife (since he has a lover in the other ""time"" zone) doesn't hold a lot of appeal.  But there is something else that redeems this unlikely plot.  The characters, for one thing, are very likeable.  And the World War II London setting draws one in, especially when Gary Sparrow brings in elements contemporary to us (Beatles songs, e.g.) providing humor and contrast.  Also, a side plot involves his contemporary wife not being able to find a job, even though she is skilled and competent.  This plays right into our current economic times with joblessness so high.  Many people could relate to this.  I may still buy this set, even though it is in the PALS format, because it is possible to play it on a computer.  I think it is also possible to connect the computer to your TV, although I haven't yet tried that.  I have watched videos purchased in Italy on my laptop, and it works fine.  I guess the bigger question is WHY DO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE DIFFERENT DVD FORMATS?  It can't be just an accident of corporate incompetence, since all companies love to make money, and they'd make a heck of a lot more if they let the general public buy and watch any video they want.  For fear of sounding almost paranoid, could it be that ??? (fill-in the blank) is preventing the people of the earth from getting to know one another more by experiencing entertainment from all parts of the globe?  We're kept very provincial by having access only to movies and TV from our own ""zone.""",1264464000,8,1891,4.544378698224852

If this review somehow reaches the attention of the powers that be:  Please, Please, Please release this DVD set on region 1 format so we can watch it here in the States!",1250726400,6,251,4.208333333333333

8346961,5,B001W4KPQM,"Very entertaining show.  Wish it was on DVD Region 1, on Prime for streaming, or something other than hunting it down on the internet.  My favorite episode is in Season 5.  It is during episode 2 as soon as Gary belts out a song.  I was in stitches.  That's all I'll say about it, because it would be a spoiler of what has to be one of the funniest bits in TV comedy.",1439683200,,367,3.9726027397260273

8346965,4,B001W4KPQM,"I enjoyed Goodnight Sweetheart.  Having bought the series I was able to watch several in a row which I think added to the enjoyment. The concept was ripe with possibilities and the writers touched on or developed many of these. My issue with the series ending was that it didn't add up: while in one show there were several portals and some future body of people could open or close these as they chose fit to, but in the last show we are left to assume that either it was chance it closed or as a result of the hero having done the task he was meant to - preventing the assassination. I also felt he was left with no means of support, and with increasing documentation stability how long could he last without being caught?
Having said that it was good fun and I have no regrets about having bought the series.",1390780800,,811,4.300653594771242

8346968,5,B001W4KPQM,"I had  many years ago seen a small  section of this DVD, back home in Glasgow, Scotland.  And I came here to the States some 18 years ago, and one wet miserable evening sitting by the television, it came to me about what happened in further episodes, and this made me look thge internet for a supplier and I thought of Amazon as being my first/last choice, and I was correct.

I have watched all 11 discs and am highly delighted with them.

Thank you, Amazon.",1355616000,,459,4.290697674418604
