However, since there are multiple episodes, they hold older children's attention for longer periods of time. And since the shows are family-oriented, it makes for a great family movie night. As a parent, the episodes didn't hold my attention specifically, but it was great to be able to watch the DVD with both of my children and not be concerned about bad language, violence, or inappropriate situations. My daughters liked it so well that they watched it several times before we returned the DVD, and 3 neighborhood children ended up watching it with us as well.

4593274,3,B005702CN6,"I agree with another reviewer--- If you DON'T have Nick Jr and your child hasn't already seen all of the episodes a million times, this is a good DVD.  But this has been my son's favorite show since it came out, so he already knew all but one episode.  We were both pretty disappointed.  They should have a list of what's on the dvd... I assumed it was new stuff.",1330905600,4,363,4.1571428571428575

4593276,4,B005702CN6,"I bought this thinking it was going to be a movie or combination of episodes not shown on Nick Jr.  I was wrong.  There was only one episode on this DVD that my son hadn't seen 100 times on our DVR.  He does LOVE all of the episodes, so if your child doesn't have episodes on DVR or has never seen one......this is a must.  My son is captivated through all of the episodes.  He started loving dinosaurs because of this show.  It is very educational and worth the money, if your child hasn't already seen all of the episodes.",1326240000,9,524,4.19

8460099,5,B005702CN6,"My grandson loves Dino Dan, he watches the dvds over and over again.  We do not get cable so the dvds are our only source to the programs.  I wish they would release more of the shows.  The DVDs are great..... My only complaint is AMAZON does NOT post run time or episodes for the dvds in their descriptions so you can end up buy more of the same episodes.  This is why I list them here:  1/ Name-A- Saurus  2/ TO FLEE or NOT to FLEE  3/ There is a COMPSOGNATHUS under my bed.  4/  DINO TRACKERS  5/  MINI DINO .... plus extras.  RUN TIME about 60 minutes.",1407715200,3,556,4.0
