1420969,5,B00005B1WX,Brings back memories of what REAL comedy is all about. You gotta love the Little Rascals,1155168000,8,88,4.5625
1420970,4,B00005B1WX,"Good collection of Rascals shorts. ""Shrimps For A day"" is the classic tale of Spanky and two midgets (Olive and Dick Brasno) who lead a kiddie revolt against a tyrannical orphanage owner. If seen in childhood, it will stay in your mind forever! ""Hi Neighbor"" and ""Fly My Kite"" are great, but easily available elsewhere (they seem to be on almost every Our Gang DVD). ""Beginner's Luck"" is a howl-fest about Spanky's misadventures at a kiddie talent show. Look for Alfalfa's debut in this one as well as the Five cabin Kids, a talented group of Black children who were quite popular at the time. Check the kiddie imitation of Louis Armstrong!
Then there's ""The Kid From Borneo."" One of the less ""politically correct"" Rascal epics, modern Black viewers may not take well to the story of the children's encounter with a Black ""jungle savage"". Stymie (of all people) is given lines referring to the title character as a ""sissy cannibal"" and a ""gorilla ape."" However, it does have moments of real humor and contains some great chase scenes. One has to really ""leave your brains at the door"" to enjoy this one and remember that the positive racial aspects of the Rascals far outweigh the negative, given the times that they were made. Personally, my reaction to the film veers between cringing and laughter, although I've seen far worse.
That aside, the transfers vary and youmay have to turn up the brightness on your tv to enjoy this set. But overall, a good collection, especially for longtime fans.",1077235200,75,1495,4.776061776061776

1421022,4,B00005B1WX,"Classic comedy that stands the test of time. In the tradition of The Three Stooges and Laurel&Hardy, this is another ""slapstick"" style piece of comedy history that will never die but with children as the stars. Although clearly outdated, if you like the 3 Stooges(check them out on AMC in the early morning hours), you will like Our Gang/Little Rascals. Nuff' said!",1283126400,,365,4.903225806451613

1421024,5,B00005B1WX,I remembered this one from when I was a kid. (yum yum eat um up) It took some research to find it. And It still cracked me up now just as it did back then. I cant see anything really racial about it. Its just all in fun. (But some people have to squawk.) Sorry to say that the people that see anything racial about this must be racial themselves. For those people that are free in there minds im sure you will enjoy this. I believe its one of the best rascal shorts. I hope you enjoy.,1279584000,5,484,3.9489795918367347
1421025,5,B00005B1WX,"I purchased the OUR GANG -LITTLE RASCALS GREATEST HITS because I wanted to introduce my seven year old granddaughter to this classic series.  I was very pleased with this DVD because I did not want the later episodes, and this DVD had many of the early hits including 'shorts' with cast members who were not featured in later episodes.

This DVD is great for fans of the LITTLE RASCAL series because the episode selections are all enjoyable, and truly 'classic'.

This was a great buy!

1421027,5,B00005B1WX,"Introduced my four year old grandson to the Rascals.....great laughs and got him away from the current rash of modern cartoon rubbish. The black and white thing was easy to get over because of the terrific content. We are still laughing at Spanky, Petey and their friends......and a great moral in every episode! Super value...",1203811200,3,327,4.963636363636364
1421028,3,B00005B1WX,"The collection is ok, not as funny as I remembered, though the last time I saw them was 20 something years ago.  The darkness of the picture (sometimes) was another thing.  I don't know - maybe all the Little Rascal b&w versions are like this.

Also, seemed like there'd been cropping (?) - some of the letters in the opening titles, for example, are not visible.

On the other hand, for the price you can't complain too much.  I don't know if these 6 shows are the ""best"" of the Little Rascals, or if they represent the same quality you'd find in larger collections, but it may be worth picking up something like this before spending more on a larger collection.  Also, after watching these episodes I started thinking I should have bought the technicolor version (bright!).",1195430400,15,775,4.62043795620438
1421029,5,B00005B1WX,"I like the Little Rascals/Our Gang but my kids haven't been interested in watching it yet because it's from ""dinosaur times"" and anything in black and white is like the plague to them but I haven't given up yet... One thing, there may be comments not acceptable in our current politically correct times but you have to take into account the views of the time and overlook them as things now long gone.",1184198400,,401,4.506849315068493
1421030,5,B00005B1WX,"This inexpensive DVD presents the viewer with five great earlier Our Gang comedies.
The prints and transfer are fairly good, especially considering the age of these shorts.
Plenty of laughs and some tears here - ""Fly My Kite"" is touching, mixing both pathos and comedy.
""The Kid From Borneo"" (""Yum, yum, eat 'em up!"") is seldom seen anymore, probably due to its insensitive racial portrayals.
But if you judge this as a product of its time, there are plenty of laughs here.",1183161600,19,473,4.780487804878049

Spanky and his laugh is the greatest.  The other shows are great too, but be ordered this especially for Yum Yum.  I highly recommend this for all ages.",1168300800,3,304,3.9833333333333334

7936833,5,B00005B1WX,"There are (unsurprisingly for such perennial favourites among vintage cinema) numerous video reissues of ""Our Gang"" (the ""Little Rascals"") available. I have two of them, a good representation of these films, not wishing to have a complete edition of ""Our Gang"", but desiring to have, on the one hand, a sizable selection and, on the other, to be sure of having one DVD, that, at least, was sure to include my departed mother's favourite, ""The Kid from Borneo"".

The two DVDs of Little Rascals material especially have satisfied my requirements, namely ""Our Gang: over 8 Hours, 16 Features, including 4 Bonus Features"", a DVD in the series, Classic Television [i.e., more accurately, in this case, cinema shorter and longer motion pictures frequently seen on TV] Series (Echo House Home Entertainment 82899) and, what is specifically under review here, ""Our Gang: Little Rascals Greatest Hits"" (Good Times Home Video Corp. 05-81095). I was pleasantly surprised that Good Times' own DVD, besides including the particularly sought after episode, was of such superior quality, in both sound and image, to what I would see on the Echo House compilation; it would seem that either the source material was better in quality or that some effort to restore the old films had been made. The improvement is most obvious on the episodes that the two DVDs include in common.

It is fun, though, to view, in whatever condition, thanks to the considerable playing time of Echo Park's rival DVD, so many episodes and also some longer-length related movies featuring one or another of the actors, having become teenagers by the time of the longer films and who had starred as tots in the ""Our Gang""; thankfully, my entire family's favourite, Carl Dean Switzer, who had played ""Alfalfa"" in the ""Our Gang"" movie shorts, is among them. So, I would heartily recommend both of the releases discussed here, to have a generous sampling of ""Our Gang"" and, in the case of Good Times' disc, to have some of them to view in really excellent quality.",1467676800,,2021,4.9411764705882355
