2884559,4,B000SFOX1Y,"There seem to be a lot of multi-movie collection sets on DVD these days, especially with horror movies.  And just like most music compilations, a lot of these tend to have one or two good titles packaged in with a bunch of crap.  It seems that they just throw things in with the sake of quantity rather than quality.  But in all fairness, I realize that trying to secure the rights to high-ranked horror movies and release them all together, especially if they're from different film companies, isn't something that can be done for a cheap price.  In light of all this, this ""Horror Movie Classics"" set is suprisingly pretty good.

The set comes in a tin case.  Pressing the red button at the top of the case plays a short clip of horror music, screaming, and other sorts of horror effects.  It's a nice little novelty feature.

When it comes to extras, again, a lot of DVD compilations don't give you much.  However, this set includes shots of movie posts, numerous trailers (which are fun to watch, especially when it comes to the tacky sci-fi titles), short bios on the actors, and trivia games.  The makers actually put some degree of effort into this.

The movies include the classics ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original silent ""Nosferatu"" (based directly off Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"").  There are also two Vincent Price films: ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Last Man on Earth"".  Price was simply a brilliant actor, and even if these two aren't ranked among his best, they're still good horror films.  As is ""Horror Hotel"" with good ol' Christopher Lee.

So at least half of what you find on this collection is certainly NOT obscure camp starring nobodys.  This was my first chance to finally see the silent film ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", which I'd never been able to find in the stores.  I had a scrambly second-hand VHS copy of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", which works great as a silent film, and was happy to see it in its full clarity on DVD.

I still haven't gotten around to seeing ""Dementia 13"", ""Nightmare Castle"", and Boris Karloff's ""The Terror"".  But even if these were left out completely, I'd be happy with the set, especially at the price I paid for them.",1224028800,13,2186,4.602067183462532
2884560,3,B000SFOX1Y,"I bought this pack because I'm a fan of old horror movies and Vincent Price.  I liked that this package included House on Haunted Hill and The Last Man on Earth.  The packaging includes a tin can with a haunting theme that can be played by pressing a red button at the end of the can.  This package also includes a bonus horror CD (which I haven't played).  Ultimately, the picture quality of the first 4 movies isn't bad, I haven't watched the rest.  My biggest complaint is that for the first 2 DVDs and for each movie on the DVDs there is a pause when moving from one chapter/scene to the next; i.e. if the movie has 9 chapters, it will pause 9 times.  This holds true for both my DVD players which have given me no problems before.  The pause is roughly 2 seconds long and although doesn't ruin the movies, does lessen their quality.",1205020800,2,837,4.292993630573249
2884561,1,B000SFOX1Y,"Another low budget package of public domain horror films, so I wasn't expecting much, but I got far less.

Each disc supposedly contains 2 movies, and when you pop the disc in a menu with the two movie selections comes up.  BUT NO MATTER WHICH BUTTON YOU CHOOSE IT ONLY CONNECTS TO THE FIRST FILM!  There seems to be no way to get to the second film.  This is simply inexcusable.

I purchased two copies of this and every disc from each copy is the same, so it's not just a faulty disc.  The fault seems to be in their DVD design.  DO NOT PURCHASE!

So the movies you get are:
Horror Hotel, The Last Man on Earth, Dementia 13, The Terror & The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari

One cannot access:
House on Haunted Hill
Night of the Living Dead
Nightmare Castle
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Nosferatu",1197504000,7,785,4.25
2884562,4,B000SFOX1Y,"HORROR MOVIE CLASSICS features ten public domain fright films on five double-sided DVDs. All are stored in a sturdy folding case that's packed within a nicely decorative tin box. Transfer quality, while not pristine, is acceptable and the films themselves are consistently good; there's even a few genuine classics here.

So if you don't have these films in your collection and want them in this box set, by all means, get it. you will not have any problems viewing them. I had to use the up/down arrows on my remote to get to the 2nd film of the disc not the side to side arrows. This may have been A.R.'s problem. PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIS REVIEW!
Have fun and happy viewing.",1230854400,8,465,3.905263157894737
