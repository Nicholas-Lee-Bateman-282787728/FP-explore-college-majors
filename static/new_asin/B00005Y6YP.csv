Except Queen Azura disappearing. Defeating Ming was not up to Darth Vader  status, but still was a challenge. True make believe!",1489881600,,286,5.355555555555555

7956341,4,B00005Y6YP,"Make sure you get the Image Entertainment DVD!  That one has all the episodes and runs 299 minutes.  I bought the 97 minute edition by accident because the reviews are all combined!

Even the 97 minute version was good, but so much was edited out, and a few times the viewer is edited into a different situation completely.

The plot involves an attempt to destroy earth once again, and Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkhov, and Dale Arden come to the rescue.  The queen of Mars has usurped the throne and turned her enemies into ""clay men.""  But behind it all is Ming the Merciless.  Lots of fun!  But remember, with all these serials, the viewer had better not ask questions (like how is it everyone speaks English, or why can you fly from planet to planet and never worry about Oxygen or temperature). These movies are meant as an escape and are best called ""feel good"" movies.  Kids love these as well as adults.",1128297600,14,911,4.539877300613497
7956342,5,B00005Y6YP,"I saw all the episodes of Flash Gordon during my adolescence and it had been for ever in my mind. Later on,as a man I had the opportunity to buy it and see it again, and I was impressed for the performance of Buster Crabbe that with the company of Dale Arden and Dr. Zarkov go in the quest to save planet Earth.

During the 13 hair-raising episodes of fabulous high adventure on Mongo, a planet complete with hawkmen, lionmen,melting rays, sky cities, rocket fleets, atom furnaces, all controlled by the cruelestdespot in the universe...Ming the merciless. comparing all this I realized that this 1951 TV series is the beginning of the new star war episodes, that is the importance of to see Flash Gordon.",1126051200,4,705,4.64
7956343,4,B00005Y6YP,"Flash Gordon is certainly the true precursor to ""Star Wars.""  Image Entertainment is distributing four feature length titles edited down to about 90 minutes from the original four hour serial length.  Zippy plots, lots of action, clever sets and surprisingly strong scripts do justice to ""THE PERIL FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""THE PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""SPACE SHIP TO THE UNKNOWN"" and ""THE DEADLY RAY FROM MARS.""
Good stuff that looks even better when cut down to the central plot.  The action does not let up. See the whole series in order.
Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe is charismatic and strangely beautiful as the lead in this beguiling comic book space opera from the late 30s.
For die hard fans of this series, the full length, uncut serial ""FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE"" is also available.",1019347200,4,796,4.925373134328358
7956344,2,B00005Y6YP,"Note that the below reviews of this disc are for the complete, 15-chapter serial FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS. This disc, however, is an edited ""feature"" version and is a poor replacement for the full serial, available from Image Entertainment (along with the other two FLASH GORDON serials) in a beautifully restored edition. Get that and skip this.",1016409600,7,349,5.0344827586206895
