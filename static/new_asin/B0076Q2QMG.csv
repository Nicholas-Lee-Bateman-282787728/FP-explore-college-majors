First let me qualify my review with the comment that ANY Rene Clair motion picture is worthwhile to see.
Rene Clair was one of the great directors of the Twentieth Century and one of the half dozen or so greatest
French filmmakers, the equal of Cocteau, Jean Vigo, Jean Renoir, and others.  So see Beauties if you are
interested in the works and development of Rene Claire.  He didn't do much work in the United States but
was brought from Europe, as many directors were in the 1930's and 40's to try and recreate his success in
the Hollywood cinema of the day.  Beauties was one of his last projects in this country.  He had worked with
Marlene Dietrich in his notable Flame of New Orleans during the World War II Years.  But by 1952, Beauties
seems very much like a ""studio-bound"" surrealistic experiment, and filled with a plethora of dream sequences,
which drag-on, until one almost feels the walls of the sound stage closing-in on the film's single protagonist.
It's a neat experiment in dream sequences and cross cutting between the protagonist's failures as a musician
and teacher in the real world and his successes and romances brought to him only through the dream world.
The problem is that it just drags on too long and seems bound by the conventions available within the sound
stages of the mid-century studio production world.  I'm sure the concept looked good on paper and Claire was
a master scenarist, writing, then revising and reediting most of his projects.  But Beauties, young as it is mostly
within boudoir interiors lacks the great energy and camera movement which characterized Claire's early work
in silent and early sound films such as the masterful story telling in Under The Roofs of Paris, Claire's masterpiece.
One must remember that Rene Clair bridged the gap between silent and sound film as a practitioner schooled in
the art of the former, with its freer camera movement.  Beauties is interesting to see once, but not to look at over
and over again.  At least that's one reviewer's opinion.",1362268800,,2108,4.769230769230769
8511137,5,B0076Q2QMG,"Rene Clair brings his observations of human nature in a gentle manner as we watch the music teacher come to terms with the search for romance. A situation to which most of us can relate. And as a sub plot the clash of opinions over what is considered noise and what is music. All is resolved when the music teacher discovers true love lives downstairs, to which he has been blind throughout the story. Gerard Philipe, Gina Lollobrigida Martine Carol, Magali Vendeuil and the rest of the cast play their parts in harmony with Clair's warmth as he explores our attitudes to the motives and idiosynchracies of life It is easy to watch this film again and again.",1355529600,,658,4.584745762711864
8511138,4,B0076Q2QMG,"Rene Clair has made some outstanding films, ""The Italian Straw Hat"", ""Sous les toits de Paris"", ""The Ghost Goes West"".  This is the latest.  It is utter fancy and very amusing.",1352764800,,176,4.645161290322581
