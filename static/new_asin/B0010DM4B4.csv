Thanks, guys, you left your reviews in the wrong place!  ""Moonlight Mile"" is a Japanese anime.  It is serious science fiction (not sci-fi, not fantasy, not vampire romance!)  The story follows Goro, a Japanese constructor with a big heart, and his American friend, Lostman, who is a pilot, to the moon.  International friendship and secret rivalries were portrayed through various events and crises that took place on Earth and later in space and on the moon.

It is not the usual Mobile Suit sci-fi fantasy anime.  In Moonlight Mile, the science is more accurate:  There is no gravity in space; space ships don't bank or stop suddenly as if flying in air or water; things float in space stations and you do need to put on a space suit and get depressurized in and out of a space shuttle.

Goro will show us a very different way of life and the perspectives of his kind.  When you're on top of the tallest mountains in the world or when you're on the moon, you simply have different (though not necessarily loftier) thoughts and worries.  It is a good change from all the eye-candy anime.  This one is aimed for adult audience or people who enjoy thoughtful dramas.  Anime in Japan can mean serious political and educational shows, too, and here is one example.

Personally, I enjoy listening to the seiyuu (Japanese voice actors).  Moonlight Mile has two big names leading the roles of Goro (Inoue Kazuhiko-san, who is probably best known as Kakashi in Naruto) and Lostman (Hirata Hiroaki-san, who is Sanji in One Piece.)  They're amazing in this show.  Please enjoy.",1230076800,4,1809,4.628930817610063

This anime is not at all related to that network show. It opens with two mountain climbers boffing some hot Sherpa ladies on their way up Everest. Drinking, smoking, sex, adventure... this is a testosterone flooded over-the-top extravaganza that somewhat to our surprise both my wife and I are really enjoying. For those of us that grew up living & breathing the space race in the '60s, a show that says you can get up there with enough guts and will really warms our hearts.
It's X-file conspiracies, Kimball Kinnison space opera, Tom Swift genius engineer... all in one. So far it has the emotional introspection of The A-Team, so it's not on the shoujou side of the fence, but both a guy who sobbs through Fruits Basket and a gal who loves Patlabor Mobile Police find this to be a primo series.",1216944000,7,886,4.578616352201258

  I really want to believe that this series is building towards something. I'm not overly optimistic by what I saw on this volume though. While this opening volume wasn't bad, I really didn't feel like I gained much by watching these episodes when I really think that I could possibly go into the next volume and be fine if I had just been given a vague summary of these episodes. I go into the next volume with caution but I sure don't recommend this one.",1213747200,2,513,4.378947368421053
8237675,4,B0010DM4B4,"A very nice new anime themed on the opening of the new commercial space frontier.  By the time the story starts, the various national space programs are well underway and lunar energy commercialization has started.  The national programs are to be merged into an international one.  We follow the story of our two protagonists,  one American, one Japanese as they inexorably find their way to becoming astronauts.

The plot isn't new, with many elements recognizable from SF.  The animation is generally very good, wand some of it excellent.  The dialog is quite adult for the most part.  The music is very reminiscent of that of the HBO series ""To the Moon"", for which this anime pays some hommage I think.

I gave this 4 stars rather than five which I would give to the best anime has to offer, e.g. ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Wings of Honneamise"".",1205712000,3,846,4.700680272108843
