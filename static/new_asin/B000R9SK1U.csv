2862841,5,B000R9SK1U,"It's about time Christians were exposed to the wonderful benefits of yoga!  I bought this DVD and have done the workout twice, and already am experiencing the positive changes.  The workout itself is about 70 minutes long, beginning with centering and stretching, advancing to strengthening and action, and finishing with an exercise of balance and guided relaxation, with a peaceful backdrop of candles and crosses.  The positions have been renamed to fit a Christian theme - Prodigal Son, Noah's Arch, Lazarus, and Holy Rollers, which made me laugh and was thoroughly enjoyable.  Throughout we have beautiful Janine Turner (Maggie from Northern Exposure) reciting some of my favorite and most inspirational Scripture verses.  The DVD is completely Christ-centered, and teaches us to worship Him not just with our minds, but bodies as well.  I bought this DVD because I was worried that my prayer life was lacking.  This is an excellent way to incorporate Christ's Word into your soul.

I noticed that Janine's abdomen showed at times, but didn't really find it to be offensive.  She's wearing workout clothes.  The workout moves at a quick pace, so it may be a good idea to view the DVD before attempting it, as is advised by the instructor.  I didn't, however, and made it through just fine.  One thing that could have been done differently was that occasionally, when a position is being held, the video briefly cuts completely to Janine reciting a verse.  I wish they wouldn't have done that because a couple of times I looked to make sure I was doing the position right, but they weren't showing that.

All in all, I totally recommend this workout.  You will not regret adding this positive workout to your busy life.",1205366400,29,1723,4.913494809688581
2862842,2,B000R9SK1U,"I was very dissapointed in this DVD.  I don't think it is wise of the star to show her belly and wear sequence in a CHRISTIAN yoga DVD. Worse is that she comes off as being sort of fake, ditzy and un-yoga-like.?  I think her intentions are good, but her behavior is way too Hollywood. Also the sequence is not a very nice flow and they give far too much scripture.",1204588800,7,364,4.112676056338028
2862843,5,B000R9SK1U,"As a Christian and exercise enthusiast, I'm very excited about yoga centered on scripture. I couldn't find reviews for Christian yoga specifically dealing with level. This DVD is a wonderful beginner DVD. Janine Turner recites scripture during each pose. Mary Cunningham leads and has a contageous sparkle in her eyes. The background is lovely and peaceful decorated with crosses & candles. Soft music plays in the background. I look forward to seeing more DVD's from this beautiful actress.",1199750400,29,491,5.3076923076923075
2862844,5,B000R9SK1U,"I am a mother of 2 young children. When I'm not running off to soccer practice, or a ballet recital I like to relieve some of my stress through exercise. I loved doing Yoga, but hated that I was bringing Eastern religions in to my home, and letting it infiltrate into my children. I found myself putting the videos on mute most of the time (which if you have ever done any kind of exercise tapes the fun is in the sound). When I caught wind that Janine Turner had just put out a Christoga exercise routine I had to have it. Being able to pop it into my DVD player, and do my workout with the sound on and the kids in the same room is the most rewarding time of my day. Its been like going to church, and the gym all in one!",1192406400,36,723,3.958904109589041
2862845,5,B000R9SK1U,"I just want to VERY strongly recommend Christoga to everyone who is looking for a superb yoga workout that also is centered around Christ.  Janine Turner along with Mary Cunningham offer an amazing workout/worship experience with recited scriptures, awesome hymnal music and an extremely relaxing set featuring crosses, candles and curtains.  They both blend their individual talents beautifully.  My sister and I work out with this DVD regularly and are constantly blessed by it.  It truly strengthens your mind, body and soul.  We are thoroughly pleased with our purchase and look forward to using it as often as possible.  Trust me you will be richly blessed and inspired by Christoga!!!!!

God Bless!!!

2862846,3,B000R9SK1U,"I actually REALLY enjoyed this...""workout"" for lack of a better term.  I love to stretch within a calm environment and this program provides that.  (Though I agree with some of the more negative reviewers that the production is  cheesy. It appears to just have slapped Christian names on Yoga moves and placed crosses in the studio.  It doesn't seem devout, at least at first blush.)

Yet how else could it be done?

For me, the larger, more important issue is why hasn't Western Christianity done more to foster worshiping its God in a more holistic manner?  In other words, what are Christians to do when they want some help strengthening their back, reliving pain or just plain old stretching?

At this time (Nov. 2010,) Christians have two options:  Try to practice a ""non-Spiritual"" Yoga, or go to physical therapy.  The latter is never as much fun or cheap enough to continue indefinitely.

I salute Ms. Turner for trying to provide something that bridges the gap between the Western emphasis on busy busy rush rush and the Christian idea of ""be still and know that I am God.""  Yet, there's got to be another way...

Yoga doesn't ""own"" stretching and deep breathing.  But Yoga is so prevalent today that as a Christian I feel guilty doing either of those things!  I wish some exercise expert would bring back a good, old fashion STRETCH workout based on common sense moves to stretch muscles.  Its as if ""stretching"" doesn't exist anymore.  Yoga has taken over.

I say dim the lights, put on some favorite music and stretch to your heart's content.  And all you fitness instructors, I think you have a HUGE market for some good old fashioned STRETCH classes and videos!!",1290556800,3,1676,4.737024221453288
2862847,1,B000R9SK1U,"Overacting, too much makeup, sleazy production trying to achieve a spiritual effect by whispering scripture in a haze was a real turnoff.  The renaming of yoga positions was amateurish and results were silly rather than inspirational.",1284768000,10,234,5.5
2862848,4,B000R9SK1U,"I've been doing yoga on and off for years for fitness and to reduce stress.  I wanted to find a practice that removed all the eastern stuff and replaced it with Christ (was thinking of doing my own version if I couldn't find one).  I was delighted to find the assortment of Christian yoga DVDs here on Amazon.  I ordered many to fulfill my New Year's resolution and will try to post feedback on each.

This video was beautiful in execution with an ideal setting.  I still have the DVD on while I am typing this because I LOVE the music.  I also loved the first and last sessions of the DVD which are great to incorporate into your workout when you have more time.  However, I felt that the poses overall were a little too basic and too easy for me.  If I were directing this video, I would have included a thirty minute aerobic yoga session that left practitioners breathless and sweating at the end (a la ""yoga fitness fusion"" by Angie Stewart or ""yoga fitness plus"" by Elise Gulan) and incorporated verses and Christian music.  The viewer could skip that session if they wanted to and just focus on the stretching and relaxing segments for a lower workout.  Another option would have been for these two women to include a third person demonstrating more challenging versions of the positions such as lower positions of the warrior (sorry, don't remember the Christoga nickname for that position) that would provide a better workout.

Overall though, I think these two women are on to something and should continue this series.  I will save this DVD to loan out to friends who want to try yoga at the beginner level.

The comment about Jeanine's shirt and attempts to be sexy is ridiculous.  This is a yoga video and its main audience will be women.  Jeanine appears natural, modest and focused on her workout.  This is a wonderful effort to fill a need in yoga practice.",1264204800,2,1872,4.559880239520958
2862849,1,B000R9SK1U,"DONT BUY IT! This woman loved herself so much that you cant focus on the workout itself. I was actually sick to my stomach having to watch her glorify her sexuality! I am all about feeling good about oneself, but she was absolutely ridiculous! Spend your money else where, but not with this joke!",1253404800,5,296,4.5
2862850,1,B000R9SK1U,"Yoga is not about ""fitness"" and Christian BS has no place in it. This is a perversion and is not yoga. It doesn't seem to be particularly Christian either. I'm no believer, but seems to me displaying a few crosses and reciting some out of context Bible verses probably doesn't make this Christian practice. This is just poorly done bogus ""fitness"" yoga with some atrocious religious pandering. I wish I believed in a God and Hell so I could hope for God to damn everyone involved in this stupid video to Hell.",1249776000,12,509,4.543478260869565
2862851,1,B000R9SK1U,"I'm sorry but do we live in the 14th century? What exactly is un-Christian about a belly button? I never thought a belly button was so scandalous. God made them, right?

I think it's bad enough that Christianity took over all the pagan holidays (Easter (who is a pagan god, btw), Christmas, etc.), now someone's trying to make money off an Eastern practice, too, by making it ""Christian""? You can call it ""Christoga"" all you want, it's still Yoga. If people are *that* offended by Eastern practices (why exactly, I don't know!), maybe they shouldn't be using them.

Big thumbs down for this video.",1247270400,18,597,4.730769230769231
2862852,4,B000R9SK1U,"I don't have much experience with yoga or poses, this was one of my first dvds. I feel great afterwards & I like doing it. I really like the workout, but I don't have anything else to compare it to. There are 2 instructors & the poses are explained very well, with options for a greater challenge. There are 7 different segments & you can do as many as you want or just play all of them. It's nice to have time where you are guided through focusing on Christ & scriptures.

My only concern is about modesty, especially since this is a Christian dvd. The red head's navel shows through the video & it just seems like she is trying to be sexy. Kind of weird!

All in all, it gets 4 stars & my recommendation.",1238112000,5,706,4.145985401459854
2862853,5,B000R9SK1U,A wonderful workout and daily devotional in one.  I have never felt the Holy Spirit as powerfully as I did after this workout.  I feel great physically and spiritually.  I recommend this to anyone!,1221436800,4,197,4.735294117647059
2862854,5,B000R9SK1U,I absolutly LOVE this dvd!!! It is beautifully filmed!! janine's voice is very soothing as she reads scripture during the poses. I love being able to incorporate spirituallity in my fitness routine!!! Well done!!!,1207267200,8,213,5.294117647058823
8199718,5,B000R9SK1U,I've been doing yoga for many many years. This is bar none the best yoga video I have ever worked out to. It is very inspirational. I can't recommend it enough. I don't understand how anyone can give this a bad review. In order to do yoga properly one needs to have an open not a closed mind. This video opens the mind and the heart.,1444780800,,333,4.0606060606060606

8199720,1,B000R9SK1U,"Continuing with the 1600 year tradition of stealing from and then digesting indic traditions, this person poaches from an age old eastern practice centered around union with the divine. This is really a travesty and disgusting thievery which will be defended by evanjihadis under the guise of freedom and persecution etc (while they were committing persecution on the entire world). First they took our land and now our ideas. You are continuing in the tradition of the pilgrims who stole from the Native Americans, the missionaries who enabled the theft of native land in Latin America, stealing and appropriation of pagan traditions worldwide.
You are a pox on this world",1424736000,,673,5.127272727272727

8199722,5,B000R9SK1U,I love doing Yoga to Christian worship. She has changed the names of the poses to biblical people and subjects.,1398211200,,111,4.6
8199723,4,B000R9SK1U,"Okay, I admit I am no good at yoga.  I'm as flexible as a potato chip!  I am a Christian, and have some reservations about yoga as it is a Hindu practice, from what I understand.

I should mention I've been in near-constant pain in my lower back/right hip for 9 months now. As a long distance runner, it's been incredibly frustrating.  I would start to feel better, only to reinjure myself again.

Yes, Janine Turner looked and acted cheesy.  She was so made up, though, and looked so beautiful, my daughter asked me, ""Is that an angel?""  Hee hee! But reciting the scripture helped me to focus on that instead.  The whole thing has brought healing to my lower back like no other independent stretching has.  My spirit found rest.  I'm willing to ignore the annoying factors in order to get some strength and flexibility for this crispy girl.",1378944000,,841,4.546666666666667
8199724,1,B000R9SK1U,"I bought this DVD because the one thing I don't like about yoga is hearing the ""mantras' and ""mudras,"" talking about my ""energy being grounded to mother earth""...New Age stuff like that.  But honestly, I'd rather put up with all of that than watch this silly ""Christian"" DVD.  A woman dressed in a big, high collar robe, with candles and crosses and dim lighting, while she recites Scripture, all the while making cute, coy expressions to the camera!  It was like watching someone taking the Lord's name in vain.  And it wasn't just once in a while--it was constant...they show a yoga pose and then the camera switches to her--she was the star of the show more than the yoga poses.  It was really creepy actually.  I was embarrassed for Janine Turner.  Even my kids were turned off--they wanted to exercise with me and they kept asking me, ""Mommy, why is she showing off like that?"" Each time the camera went back to her in her little spa area, my kids would look at me with an ""isn't this creepy?"" expression on their faces.  I finally had to turn it off--could not get through it.  The other lady with her should just make a video on her own--I liked what she did with the stretching.",1362355200,7,1186,4.47906976744186
8199725,4,B000R9SK1U,"I got a great workout with Janine's version of ""Christoga.""  I'm a devout Christian so I have no problem with yoga being presented from a Christian perspective.  I've seen several reviews of putting Christians down for practicing yoga in their own religion.  Hey, isn't that what freedom of religion is all about??  Besides, the Bible mentions meditation.  The word ""meditate"" is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments.  We Christians believe that the mind, body and soul are all connected, just like the Hindus and Buddhists who practice yoga.  The big difference is that the traditional yoga practice tells you to empty your mind, but the Bible says we should ""renew our minds.""

As far as the presentation of this Christian-style yoga, the crosses and candles added a nice touch which presented a worshipful atmosphere.  The music was very worshipful and beautiful, too.  On the negative side, I didn't think it was necessary to have Janine's face to appear when reciting scripture.  Janine was overly-dressed for a yoga workout.  I just don't think about wearing makeup, jewelry and looking glamorous when I'm working up a sweat.  That part was too ""Hollywood"", I must admit.  That's why I rated this DVD 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, it's a great workout in a worshipful, Christian atmosphere.",1360886400,,1301,4.986046511627907
8199726,5,B000R9SK1U,"As a Certified Pilates Instructor, health and fitness lover, Christian woman, I loved, loved, loved this DVD. I was so blessed by the workout. It IS fitness, spiritual and physical. The music was perfect, my favorites - it's loaded with so many wonderful scriptures, which are given while holding each pose (which are given scriptural names) -too numerous to count! I've used many I would love to see this DVD re-published.  Our Creator made our bodies, knowing what they can do, need to do, and we need this. Humans have taken all kinds of things from His Creation and called them something else as if they created it, but every good and perfect gift is from Him first. We need to reclaim these things and use them to Glorify Him. Those who scream about this are usually stiff and bitter. Because Music has been perverted, is all music evil? Or art? Or medicine? Or food? Herbs? NO, they all originated with the Creator.",1351555200,,921,4.6503067484662575
