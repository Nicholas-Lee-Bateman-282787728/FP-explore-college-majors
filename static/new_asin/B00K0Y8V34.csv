6867084,5,B00K0Y8V34,Good use of basically everything.  Watched IXCANUL the same day though and preferred that over this.,1486598400,2,100,5.25
6867085,5,B00K0Y8V34,"Thought provoking and filmed amazingly, this film is definitely one not to miss. Be prepared for a very heavy experience, but one you won't soon forget, if ever. Excellent commentary on our times, a real prompt to reflect doubly-well on the messages we are sending to our young, and the needs they have which are so often going unaddressed for reasons which this film identifies with stark clarity. Brace yourself.",1486166400,8,414,4.928571428571429

8691207,1,B00K0Y8V34,"You think showing your junk on screen is going make me overlook everything else wrong in this film? Getting someone to take off their clothes on film is a momentary distraction and a sign of desperation that could be saved by good writing. I don't care how hot you are, or how enticing you think you can be on camera. It won't work. You need more than a nice ass. You need a story to go with it.",1530921600,,395,4.076923076923077

8691210,5,B00K0Y8V34,"Fascinating, mesmerizing with a dream-like quality that suits this film perfectly. It shifts seamlessly from the serene interplay of light and shadow to sudden explosive violence that drives the film to its  inexorable climax.",1492819200,2,226,5.647058823529412
8691211,1,B00K0Y8V34,"Completely wasting my time..like you are going through a gallery with photography exhibition, keep guessing the meaning behind each photograph...yes it is pretty to look at, but so what???",1492646400,,188,5.517241379310345
8691212,5,B00K0Y8V34,"This is a challenging movie to watch. Its beautifully shot in black and white, and most of the action happens at night. Suggestions in cinematography abound  there are scenes with dust, pollen and feathers flying around in the air suggesting the looseness (or is it easiness?) buffeting in a young persons life. The hard life of a poor Helsinki housing estate is reflected in concrete, concrete verandahs, poor windows, no gardens or trees, interiors in need of repair The protagonist is a 14-year-old boy, Simo, who while not beautiful or handsome, has an openness, a potential for good or evil (?) on his young face. Simo appears to watch all wide-eyed, and trying to discern what is good and what is bad. Simos brother is going to jail. Simos mother has a lot of problems. You see he is starved for love or direction  he looks up to his brother, who has human flaws, but might not be a good role model. There is a gay neighbor who seems to offer opportunity for hope against the nihilism of his brother, but an encounter ends badly. Was there sexual assault when Simo was young? Are the platitudes about hope offered by the gat neighbor real or words to seduce him (again?). There are Felliniesque sequences (in black and white) that suggest depravity and hope. New scenes as Simo appears to discover Helsinki are introduced by an aria  hopeful scenes in churches, depraved violent scenes.
I read other reviews to try and understand this film better. The look of Concrete Night pulls the trigger on an explosion of visual memories and subconscious references, most of them linked to films of social importance  yes! I found You have to choose a face, the voiceover says, and as Simo stares into a mirror, hes trying to figure out whos staring back. Such moments of duality are rampant in Concrete Night. Honkasalo exploits every reflective surface she can find, suggesting alternate identities and possibilities, juxtaposing the what-ifs of a parallel existence, where Simo might have been born and better educated and made less morally porous, and where the influences on him might not have been so poisonous.
Whats the plot - Simo has no idea where he is going in terms of psychological development. He has no clue what to think, and appears to borrow bad/nihilistic ideas from his brother. He is angry because he sees the people he loves hurting themselves and lying to suggest they are not.
This is a beautiful film. I don't understand it fully, but I do recommend it. Many scenes are like feelings we cannot articulate, but feel very strongly about. There is no resolution. It saddens me when other reviewers dismiss it so rapidly.",1492300800,10,2639,4.780701754385965

8691214,3,B00K0Y8V34,A bit confusing. Not into movies that are English subtitled. Will be viewing this movie again. Was not crazy about that it is a black and white movie.,1489708800,,150,4.392857142857143
8691215,2,B00K0Y8V34,"Excellent cinematography, but that's it.  There is no storyline.  What should develop doesn't.  This is just a visual piece without any substance.  It's quite unfortunate, actually.",1489449600,3,181,5.846153846153846
