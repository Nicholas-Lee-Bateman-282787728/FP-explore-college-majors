8016788,4,B0001W69PC,"Fantasy Fest 2 is a lot like a Girls Gone Wild dvd. It's a bunch of public flashing, and or body paint. Many of the people featured are wearing costumes or body paint. If you like Girls Gone Wild, or Girls Going Crazy check this out!",1307404800,2,233,4.086956521739131
8016789,4,B0001W69PC,"I had wondered about Fantasy Fest in Key West, Florida, but their web site barely hints at all the gorgeous flashing ladies as are shown on this DVD!! Many people are in various costumes or are painted with all kinds of wild designs on their bodies, so this is a good DVD for those things too. Most of this was filmed on the streets of Key West, with a couple of segments in clubs or bars. But there's no explanation here of what Fantasy Fest is about, or the origins of it. There's just this film of people who attended, possibly in 2003. The emphasis here is on topless ladies, although some are fully nude but painted all over. A good many of them are stacked too! And sorry, ladies, although there are lots of guys in costumes here, very few flash the camera or are painted nude.

So, this DVD is very similar to series like Crazy Chicks or Girls Gone Wild, but with more emphasis here on costuming and body painting. Oddly, the editing is occasionally very sloppy, with several flubs and pointless shots that should have been cut. Camerawork is quite decent, although not the best I've seen. I like that the sound is live from the event and not some obtrusive music track. So overall, FANTASY FEST #2 a good DVD, not quite as good with regard to flashing as some devoted to that like Crazy Chicks or Wild Party Girls, but if you like costuming and body painting you might like to get this one too. And recently I've discovered another DVD in the series that's a little better put together than this one, entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erotic-Fantasy-Fest-1/dp/B003J2I7BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erotic Fantasy Fest #1</a>. (I reviewed it on that page.)

In the meantime, I'm getting out my map and heading for Key West......",1217203200,5,1785,4.849180327868853
