6069509,4,B00GB0OX10,"Seeing movies like this reminds me why we love movies so much. You can tell that there is a message, remember those? No car chases, huge shootouts, explosions, a six packed white leading man and a doll faced blonde falling in love with him. Nope. This film is real. The story about true love and what happens to someone when the person they lived for dies. I cried. And I don't cry. Loved Mr. Glover, Mr. Greene, and the newbies. Mike Wade, Chelsea Ricketts, Ashley Bell, and Adriana Mather. There is hope for this ""Transformer-ing"" industry yet! Stories like this need to be seen. BUY this movie! And a box of tissues!",1407715200,,619,4.535714285714286
