2692983,5,B000KJU1G4,"Than you are really going to appreciate this.  The '87 Twins are a classic eighties baseball team.  Small ball, tight jerseys, mustaches, and mullets run rampant and nothing is better than T.K. in his first year as manager looking as stoic as ever.  Great stuff.",1326067200,,262,4.777777777777778
2692984,5,B000KJU1G4,"If you ever wanted to re-watch the '87 World Series like I did, puchase this item. The extras are just icing on the cake of the original games. I got this item for a total of about $19 (including shipping) and it was worth every penny...if you're teetering on whether to get it or not, buy it. Only pass on it if you are a Cardinals fan.",1311292800,,337,4.044776119402985
2692985,5,B000KJU1G4,"A chance to relive the 1987 World Series.  Each game included in its entireity, I love that idea.  Over-all, the series wasn't that exciting.  The first two games were Twins blowouts, so as a Twins fan, I enjoyed that, but there wasn't much drama involved.  The three games in St. Louis were downright boring.  It wasn't until the last two games where there was some drama and excitement.  The set also includes division clinching moment, and ALCS clinching moment, which are nice bonuses.  Victory parade coverage also included.  After watching it, it seems like it just happened a few years ago, it's hard to believe it's been that long.

If you're a Twins fan, this is a must-have.  If you're the average baseball fan, this set is a good bargain for the price.",1308268800,,763,4.669172932330827
2692986,5,B000KJU1G4,I bought this as a gift for my dad for Father's Day. He LOVES it!,1215388800,,65,3.4
2692987,5,B000KJU1G4,"This is the first world series I remember watching very closly & really caring about.  My Mom & Dad were Twins fans & we watched every game, every pitch of this amazing series live with baited breath.  For Twins fans this is a easy ""must have"".  For fans of baseball world series who never saw this remarkable set of seven games, you will want to watch.  It is pure fun! Now please the 1991 series.  Please!",1194739200,,407,4.302631578947368
2692988,5,B000KJU1G4,"A nice remembrance of a great World Series, Minnesota's first championship since the great Lakers teams of the late '40's and early '50's.",1181433600,,138,5.043478260869565
2692989,5,B000KJU1G4,"I am a big Twins Fan and have been waiting for the World Series DVDs to come out.  I never recorded the games and I've always been sorry I haven't.  This product is so clear and without commercials, and I've been watching them over and over.  It's especially significant to my family and me as they hear me talking about the series and now they can see it for themselves.  Thank you so much for having this available.",1178928000,6,417,4.3076923076923075
2692990,4,B000KJU1G4,"Following up on others' reviews, I would agree that the sound quality during the first several innings of Game 6, in particular, is poor.  NOTE: the sound on the original TV broadcast of this game was fine (I taped it off of TV at the time).  I contacted A&E about this issue, and they said there was nothing they could do about it.  My guess is the ABC Sports master tape has degraded in quality over the past 20 years (or they gave A&E a poor copy of it).

Also, the inclusion of pre- and post-game coverage would have made it even better.

Having said all of that, this is still a must-own item for long-time Twins fans.  Cardinals fans may want to own it too for historical purposes and footage of solid play by several of their stars at the time, although they should look to the 1982 or 2006 World Series for better highlights of their team.",1178064000,3,847,4.29559748427673
2692991,4,B000KJU1G4,"This set contains the complete 1987 ABC Network World Series game coverage.  Each of the seven discs comes in its' own case with the box score and game summary of that specific game.  I was a bit surprised that the ABC pre-game and post-game shows weren't included.  A nice feature is that you can play these DVD's by the half inning if you wish.

  The 7th disc also contains nine bonus features, four of which are from the ABC broadcast, and two others were from the NBC coverage of the 1987 AL Championship Series.  The other three features were ""A History of the Minnesota Twins"", the end of the AL West clinching game against Texas, and some of the Minneapolis and St. Paul victory parades.  The seven minute ""A History of the Minnesota Twins"" was disappointing becuse it was so short.

  This set is a must for Twins fans.  Cardinals fans might not enjoy it quite so much.  More general fans might be able to get by with the cheaper MLB Vintage World Series Films: Minnesota Twins 1987 & 1991.",1176508800,10,999,4.483333333333333
2692992,5,B000KJU1G4,"These are the complete broadcasts of all 7 games played between the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals in the 1987 World Series - 4 games in the Metrodome and 3 games in Busch Stadium.  The quality of the broadcasts is very nice, with the exception of the sound during parts of Games 6 & 7.  During the first 2.5 innings of Game 6 the sound is really bad and, while not as bad as Game 6, the sound during the first 6.5 innings of Game 7 isn't very good.  Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer do the call on all 7 games.

I'm a little bit surprised that this set was released before the 1991 Twins vs. Braves series because 3 of these games weren't competitive.  Also, it was very cold in Busch Stadium for games 3 & 4, so the crowd enthusiasm is somewhat low.  All in all, it's a great trip down memory lane to watch these games again.  Let's hope that the good folks at A&E continue to release more and more games in the future.",1176163200,17,939,4.154696132596685

8157663,3,B000KJU1G4,"This was fun to watch after nearly 30 years have passed, I was very disappointed in the sound quality in some parts however. I think one whole game you can hardly hear the announcers. With that said it is worth watching this again the guys in the booth have incredible knowledge of the game and what to expect on the field very interesting  to listen to their incite, when you can here them of course.",1426204800,,401,4.346666666666667

8157667,2,B000KJU1G4,"The Twins' two championships were a bit of a travesty, in that they could only win in that dome with the shallow roof and unnaturally loud noise.  Would they have won either year if they had to play on the road?  Probably not, right?

I'd prefer seeing
1971, Pirates-Reds, 7 games
1972, Athletics-Reds, 7 games
1973, Athletics-Mets, 7 games
1978, Yanks-Dodgers w the Bucky Dent game in Boston
1982, Cardinals-Brewers, 7 games
1997, Marlins-Indians, 7 games",1344038400,,456,4.973684210526316
