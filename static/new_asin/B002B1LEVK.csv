8360598,5,B002B1LEVK,"Francois (Christian Clavier) is an aristocrat on a mission to save France.  His mission is to go to London and make a purchase from an ex KGB agent.  Unfortunately, Francois doesn't speak English and at the last minute, his usual interpreter can't accompany him.  Enter Jean-Pierre (Daniel Auteuil), a man as different from Francois as he could be.  This madcap action comedy moves at rocket speed.  In addition to the hilarious performances of the two French leads are delightful comedic performances by John Cleese and Jennifer Saunders.
