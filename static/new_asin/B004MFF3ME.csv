8436012,5,B004MFF3ME,"Well if you can stand constant recaps of information between watching each of the DVDs and the seminar format, the information in this series is extremely interesting.  Despite some repetitive review segments, Doug Batchelor keeps the pace of the series interesting with interesting facts and anecdotes.  After years of listening to prophecy ""experts"" who have no idea why prophecy doesn't directly mention or hint at America in eschatological events, I found the explanation of one of the beasts as being the U.S. to be ""plain as day"".  Kind of slap your forehead simple.  Batchelor has this effect by unlocking the symbolic pictures that are contained in apocalyptic scriptural references.  Great DVD set.  You won't regret paying the money if you're really interested in these types of subjects.

8436013,5,B004MFF3ME,I have enjoyed watching this series of Bible prophecy seminars several times. Each time I learn something I missed before. Doug Batchelor is an energetic and dynamic speaker who keeps your attention throughout the series. I highly recommend watching.,1337472000,4,250,5.435897435897436
