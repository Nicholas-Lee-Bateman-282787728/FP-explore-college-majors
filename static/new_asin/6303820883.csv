718297,5,6303820883,"I cannot think of a better director/screenwriter & actor combination than Hartley & Donovan (respectively). As with his other films, Hartley showcases an offbeat, yet deadpan, approach to dialogue and physical  expression. Combine this with the odd story and tangental sideshows, and  what you'll end up with is one delightfully strange film. Hartley also  shows a gift for finding talented - yet largely unknown - actors (at least  to the general American audience at large). Martin Donovan (the amnesiac)  has collaborated with Hartley in the past (most successfully, I feel, in  *Trust*), and theirs is a team that works well. Donovan's presence,  combined with an expression that requires little movement to shift from  irritation to affection to confusion, makes him perfect for the largely  deadpan stylings of Hartley's writing and direction. Isabelle Huppert, the  esteemed French actress, makes her American screen debut in this film. A  superb performer, she contributes to the near-minimalist character  tonalities by displaying the largest range of emotions without breaking the  carefully set mood of the film. Elina Lowensohn and the rest of the cast  also give strong performances.  Another notable shift in this film from  previous Hartley productions is the improvement in music.  While a  wonderfully comedic  film, *Amateur* is definitely not a film for the  masses. The humor and storyline are both odd enough to leave most anyone  thinking, ""Huh?"" for at least part of the film, but such  questions and queries are generally answered five minutes later. Certainly  one that rates second and third viewings, *Amateur* is delightful movie.",912470400,2,1658,5.390625
718440,5,6303820883,"This is my favorite Hal Hartley film, several of the scenes do not fail to bring a tear to my eye or give me a feeling of frisson and I saw it for the first time in 1995.  I think that should say it all.
Purist Hartley fans seem to believe that Trust is the quintessential Hartley, and while I agree that the film is great, Amateur has a much more complicated plot and explores more complicated issues.
The film is all about ontology.  What is the nature of being? Can one change? What is memory?  Is there an essential nature to existence or is existence mutable depending on experience?
Don't think, however, this is some weird indie/foreign flick heavy on the meaning.  Hartley manages to pose all of the above questions within a film that is quirky and funny and deadpan and sad and wonderful all at the same time.
Yes, I know this man.",1082592000,3,840,4.365384615384615
718441,4,6303820883,"Here's the trademark Hartley quirkiness that fuses bullets with uncertainty, a fried-brain accountant and two sexy women, semi-stagey dialogue and neatly dressed corporate hit men.  Here's Parker Posey in a small role, Michael Imperioli (of The Sopranos) in a smaller one, and Martin Donovan as the amnesiac lead male who gets involved with Isabelle Huppert's character, an ex-nun who's turned to writing porno fiction--unfortunately, bad enough to make her publisher reject her work.
And here's Elina Lowensohn as well as a porno actress who wants out of her tawdry (though well-paying) life, whose sad eyes and possible death wish clash with her overly sensuous demeanor.  How can all these disparate elements, you ask, ever possibly blend into a whole?
An excellent question.  In Hartley's film, they do and they don't.  Nobody really knows anything for sure; everyone here is an amateur at life, trying to figure out what to do next--or not knowing how to do anything next.  Thomas (Martin Donovan's character) can't remember his name or what he did in the past.  Isabelle (Huppert's character) knows intuitively she's linked to Sofia (Elina Lowensohn's role) but she doesn't know how.  The accountant, Edward (Damian Young) seems self-assured until he has his brains fried and then he's completely unpredictable.
There's shooting and torture and a little love making.  There's uncertainty or puzzlement around every corner.  We never really know a whole lot, Hartley's saying, and because of that, you could, in fact, meet a porno-loving ex-nun.  You could be an accountant whose neat orderly life is scrambled into violent outbursts and uncontrollable behavior.  You could wind up becoming a man who doesn't remember his name and makes some effort to find out what it is, but not enough to discover it.
So is this a coherent film?  Hartley is interested more in character than coherence.  Structure is not as important as how people actually impact each other, how they impinge on each other's lives.  It is, he says, this random colliding of personalities that determines what will happen; people are so complex and so full of possibilities that things just...happen as a result of them being brought together.
Once the viewer accepts this perspective, everything falls into place.  Or randomly shifts into place--falling here, rising there, making a jagged turn when you least expect it.
This is less satisfying than Hartley's masterpiece Henry Fool, but it is nevertheless a very intriguing film and definitely worth seeing.",1032134400,2,2533,5.219753086419753
718442,5,6303820883,"I was channel-surfing when I landed on IFC showing a ""comedy-drama"" called Amateur. It was nearly an hour in, and there was this scene of these two geeky accountant types arguing about the merits of various cell-phones while using the wires from a floorlamp to electrocute a Christopher Lloyd look-alike. High-concept, but decidedly ""B"", I thought. But as the movie progressed, I began to notice the deliberation that led to the quirky stagger of the film. The style itself was saying things that the action couldn't begin to convey. This was high art! And it was funny in an intentionally-unintentional way.
The plot, about an ex-nun who now writes bad pornography, a porn queen with a grudge, and an ex-pornongrapher with amnesia, each searching for their identity, is interesting, but it doesn't begin to tell of the impressive stylishness of this movie. Amateur sucks you in like Beckett mixed with ""letters to Penthouse"", and leaves you satisfied on both accounts. If this sounds good to you, you should check it out. It shows on IFC quite frequently. Oh also, this movie turned me into a freak for Elina Lowensohn.",1016755200,14,1120,4.931216931216931
718443,4,6303820883,"Another overlooked Hal Hartley gem with Martin Donovan playing an amnesia victim who is nursed to health by a nymphomaniacal virgin nun played by French actress Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is superb as the contradictory runaway nun who is trying to adapt to life outside the convent. Donovan, with amnesia and all, is confused anyhow, but also cannot understand how a nun can be a self-professed nymphomaniac without ever having had sexual relations. Huppert's nun is anxious to shed herself of her virginity and many times wants to do so with Donovan, but circumstances keep preventing them. I have not seen this movie in quite some time, but I recall that it is classic Hal Hartley, with a cast of wicked and crazy characters in unbelievable situations. Donovan's amnesia patient begins to learn that he was not such a nice guy in his pre-amnesia days as more characters come into focus and more things happen. Huppert stands by him nevertheless. Donovan pays for whatever is coming to him in the end, but not before Huppert manages to declare her love for him.",1000339200,,1061,4.867403314917127
718444,4,6303820883,"A chance encounter in a coffee shop between two people, both of whom are seeking their own identities (one literally, one figuratively), leads to a relationship seemingly beneficial to both, but for different reasons, in ""Amateur,"" written and directed by Hal Hartley.  A man (Martin Donovan) wakes up one morning lying on his back in a quiet, out-of-the-way street in New York City; all he knows is that he's bleeding from the back of his head and is suffering from total amnesia.  He has no identification on him; he has no idea who he is or how he came to be on that street.  Dazed, he stumbles into a small coffee shop and sits down at the counter.  He tries to order something, but the only money he has is Dutch, and he has no idea why.  A young woman, also sitting at the counter and working on a lap-top computer, observes his plight and notices the blood on the back of his neck.
 Her name is Isabelle (Isabelle Huppert); asking for some water, she cleans his injury and buys him something to eat.  Isabelle, it turns out, is a former nun, having only recently left the convent after fifteen years.  Rather lost herself, she is attempting to make a living by writing pornographic stories for a magazine.  A self-professed nymphomaniac (though she is still a virgin), she also feels that she has a specific purpose in life, a destiny she has yet to fulfill, though she has yet to figure out what it is.  But she believes that meeting this man is a sign; perhaps he's a part of whatever it is she has to do.  So she decides to help him, which just may lead her to the answers she is seeking about her own life, as well.
 As with all of Hartley's films, this one has a somewhat mesmerizing effect, which he exacts with a unique style of presenting his story that has to do with the look and feel of the film, the deliberate pace he establishes, and most especially the manner in which his actors deliver their lines.  His performers speak with a rather stoic, matter-of-fact, understated rhythm that is engrossing in itself, very similar to the kind of cadence David Mamet employs in his films.  But Hartley's method is even more pronounced, so that when one of his characters does have an emotional outburst, the underplaying that surrounds it significantly underscores the impact of it all.
 Few directors have such a unique style that so vividly identifies their work;  Mamet is one, Ingmar Bergman another (the three of them being part of a very select group).  And though this particular film is not, perhaps, one of Hartley's best, it is still pure Hartley, with aspects that are certainly engaging and memorable, beginning with his main character, Isabelle.  Talk about an off-the-wall character!  And yet, within the context of the story, she comes across as quite real and believable, which says something about Huppert's ability as an actress, as well as Hartley's expertise as a director.
 Huppert gives a very credible performance here, convincingly conveying that sense of confusion Isabelle obviously harbors deep within about her own life and where she's headed.  She makes you realize that beyond anything else that's happening, this is essentially a person searching for a place to fit in, which is why she makes such a connection with this stranger, this man who really has no idea of who he is or where he belongs.  And Huppert certainly makes Isabelle someone with whom it is easy to empathize.
 Donovan, a veteran of many of Hartley's films, is very effective here also, with a very pensive, understated performance that clearly indicates an honest sense of this man's bewilderment, as does the very real caution with which he approaches his situation as he attempts to reorient himself and get on with his life.  And Hartley develops the relationship between Isabelle and this man in real time-- there's no instant love affair here, as happens so often in cinematic renderings of similar situations-- which gives a ring of authenticity to the story, bizarre as it may get.
 The supporting cast includes Elina Lowensohn (Sofia), Damian Young (Edward), Chuck Montgomery (Jan), Dave Simonds (Kurt) and Pamela Stewart (Officer Melville).  No one can capture a sense of disenfranchisement any better than Hartley, as the characters in ""Amateur"" so aptly illustrate; these are people perpetually on the outside looking in, and yet there's something about them with which you will be able to relate, as well as sympathize .  And that's part of Hartley's magic; making you realize, that in the end we're not so different from one another, after all.",989366400,6,4569,4.7872611464968156

718446,5,6303820883,"To his typically perceptive mix of quirky character-based comedy and  drama, writer/director Hal Hartley adds a wry, clever, and offbeat noir  style crime drama plot, though ultimately the film is still an exploration  of identity issues, with Martin Donovan's amnesiac character serving as the  focal point.  The cast is superb, particulary Donovan in the lead, and  Isabelle Huppert in the co-starring role of a pornography-writing ex-nun  who decides to help him on his quest to find out who he is.  Elina  Lowensohn is, as always, wonderfully strange, haughty, beautiful and  offbeat as someone who was an important part of the Donovan character's  pre-amnesia life.  To give away more would be to spoil somewhat the  experience of seeing this delightful small-scale film for the first  time.
It's astounding, though, that of all of Hartley's films, this is  the ONLY one that has not been priced for retail sale.  96 bucks is simply  an absurd price to have to pay for this, especially considering it's been 5  years since this film was released!  Considering Hartley's loyal cult  following, and the difficulty in finding a film like this for rent in a  typical video store, this is definitley exactly the sort of film that would  tend to lend itself to purchase rather than rental.  Columbia/Tri-Star is  stupidly missing out on sales opportunites for this film by refusing to  price it for retail.  It's no wonder that, in spite of Hartley's following  and how good this little film is, that it ranks very low on Amazon's sales  rank.  Thank goodness Hartley's other films have ended up in the hands of  smarter and more savvy distributors.",968025600,3,1648,4.974169741697417
718447,5,6303820883,"Restraint wrings our emotion. Jumping up and down can express joy, but a perfect ballet segment will convey ecstasy so complete the dance pratically creates it. Subtlety often can explode emotions larger than realism.
Hal  Hartley understands this. The characters in his film do not talk like real  people. Their speech is subdued, flat, and usually bluntly honest. Their  small words carry mountains of meaning.
Most mystery films focus on the  identity of the bad guy. This film instead chooses to explore the bad guy's  identity.  The film opens with him laying unconscious on a cobblestone  street. He awakes but has no idea who he is. With this premise, the  audience always knows who the bad guy is. He is in almost every frame of  the feature. The rest of the film sets about discovering who the bad guy  is.
I'm avoiding the film's plot. Telling too much about this film  steals many of its pleasures, although I have enjoyed it each of the ten  times I have seen it. Most scenes are arranged as artfully as a painting,  the actors understand and enlarge Hartley's vision, and the music, ranging  from Liz Phair to Pavement, is excellent.
This film may well be the best  the ninties have to offer.  Hartley's own Simple Men is one of the only  other real contenders.",946425600,7,1274,4.6923076923076925
718448,5,6303820883,"Hartley is a genious when it comes to getting to know the human heart and the problemas of our times, this movie despite it's title is a deep work into the necesity of redemption and understanding of oneself, the cast and  the music makes this film one of true discovery. I have seen all his films  and possible the Book of life could be better somehow, this is still one of  his best movies yet.

Both movies debuted in 1994 with casts of equally unsavory characters.  The ""hip"" hitmen-in-suits pair appears in both 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Amateur' and one of Hartley's female leads has the exact same hair-style as the Uma Thurman character in 'Pulp Fiction'.  Similarities aside, I liked this film despite the fact that there was not one likeable character in it for me.  It does receive demerits, however, for the mere fact that Isabelle Huppert's haircut is among the worst I've ever seen and distracted me from the plot more than once!",1290470400,,677,4.760683760683761

Anyway; I watched the movie and with Hal Hartley you get his typical offbeat deadpan comedy style. The movie is clever; well-written; funny and another great Hal Hartley film that I've seen. I currently own most of his films on DVD and just got a couple more to get. If you are familar with and have enjoyed other Hal Hartley films then please don't miss this one. The only problem I have with this and other films of Hal Hartley is too many have gone out of print and you have to buy used.

7853877,3,6303820883,"The subject matter alone drew me to this movie. Not knowing the history of the director, Hal Hartley, but knowing of his followers, I decided to check it out. In the end, I was a little disappointed. I'll talk more of this later.

  The story evolves around a nun who leaves the convent because she believes that she is a nymphomaniac. But yet, she's never had sex. She decides to start writing pornographic stories for a nudie magazine to vent her sexual frustration. Soon, she meets an injured man who has amnesia. Little does the nun know, but this man has ties to the porn industry. She has a spiritual revelation and decides to help this man find out who he is. This leads them both into trouble with hired assassins and crazed accountants. A wild story indeed.

  The problem I had with the film was the acting. It seemed as if the characters were just performing their lines and waiting for the director to yell, ""CUT"". Some scenes would get you deeply interested with the bizarre characters and strange situations. Then, the acting would just blow it.

  All in all, it's not a bad film. It tries hard to be like a ""Blue Velvet"" era David Lynch, but falls terribly short with the lack of any visual flair. I would recommend seeing the film, but watch a friend's copy before you decide to buy.",1173312000,,1300,4.497872340425532
7853878,4,6303820883,"Typically, Hartley's films are not for everyone (some might argue they're not for anyone). Still, if you've got the patience, you familiarize yourself with the style of writing, pacing and acting, you'll be rewarded.  Or you could just be like me and instantly devour everything Hartley writes, shoots and films with an insatiable appetite.  Whatever works for you.

This film, albeit about a ex-nun-cum-pornographer, may possess the most mainstream ""feel"" of any Hartley film I can think of.  A first rate cast has been assembled and, without giving away anything, the story has a genuine feel of propelling itself forward in ""pseudo-Hollywood"" style.  But it ain't Hollywood.

Living screen legend Isabelle Huppert stars as Isabelle, the fallen nun writing porno stories to pay for her humble existence while waiting reluctantly (and half awake) for some sort of sign of divine inspiration.  Along for the ride is a young Euro porn star, a man suffering from amnesia who wakes up all bloodied up in an alley, a young corporate pirate on the run from the Russian mob for some missing computer discs, a young punk hip chickster played by Parker Posey with everything coming to life and death proportions in a convent in the country.  You have to see for yourself.

If this sounds up your alley, you will be rewarded with a surprisingly moving film that will have you scratching your head throughout.  Beautifully acted, shot with Hal at the helm.

Not quite on the level of Hartley's ""Henry Fool"" - but few films are.
