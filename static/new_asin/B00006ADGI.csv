1738567,3,B00006ADGI,"From the description, I thought this might be one of those amusing T&A flicks from the 70's. The ones where the girls are jiggling out of their tops in all sorts of preposterous situations. The story is boring, not funny at all. Cassandra Peterson is topless, not naked as the alternative title suggests. It's definatley her, she does the same thing with her eyes that she does when accenting a punchline as the Elvira character. When you've seen this once, your not likely to sit through it again.",1252281600,20,498,4.670454545454546

7966423,4,B00006ADGI,"Well, as promised here are the Pros and Cons of this movie as I see it, without a spoiler of the ending if you have not seen it before.
Pros:
1. Actually a fairly entertaining film considering the story line starts with a woman moving to Los Angeles without any money in the 1970s.
2. A interesting take on feminism in this film.
3. Cassandra Peterson (Elvira) is in the film and acts as a topless dancer.
4. The ending was actually a surprise to me and that rarely happens.
Cons:
1. Poor quality transfer, looks and sounds like it was copied from a VHS or BETA tape,
2. The acting is nothing to write home about, but still overall fun.
Neither Pro or Con:
1. I wonder if this film was the inspiration for the TV show ""Three's Company""?",1514073600,,736,4.264285714285714

7966425,3,B00006ADGI,"Not a bad movie, but not as salacious as the ads would have one believe. An interesting early-feminism study, with sincere performances. Caveat emptor.",1482278400,,151,5.333333333333333

7966429,3,B00006ADGI,"This version of Working Girls is a 70s drive-in movie, not to be confused with the other later and much superior ""Working Girls"" w/Jane Fonda, etc.  This one features Sarah Kennedy, Goldy Hawn's replacement on TV's old ""Laugh-In"", Simon Sturgis, son of classic film director Preston Sturgis, and Elvira, TV vamp.  Directed by Stephanie Rothman, queen of low budget girl flicks, this one involves a comely young woman's adventures looking to make some honest bucks in LA.

I ordered a copy mainly because I was the assistant director on this film, but never got to see the finished product.  I remember the cast & crew as nice folks, especially Elvira, but the
film is nothing special.  Also not the best print for this DVD issue.",1340668800,10,729,4.8
7966430,3,B00006ADGI,"I spent many an hour in the drive-in in the Seventies, and this is exactly the sort of thing you'd see.  The storyline is engaging, there is some mild sexuality, and then a few over-the-top things thrown in for Cormen-eque audience interest.  Yes, you get to see Elvira doing a striptease dance (more interesting and mercifully shorter than most I've seen in movies), but the real characters of interest are Sarah Kennedy, with a strange squeaky voice as Honey, and Laurie Rose and Lynne Guthrie as the other sirens.  It's all easily forgotten, but not dull.  Code Red consistently does a good job with the picture, sound, and extras, so pick this one up before it disappears.",1306022400,5,676,4.752136752136752
7966431,4,B00006ADGI,"It is good to finally get a decent copy of Working Girls in widescreen DVD after all these years. Like the other reviewer stated, its not what you think. Just like other Stephanie Rothman films of the '70s, they are tame by exploitation standards...that's why I enjoy them! I feel Rothman did not exploit women like a male filmmaker would. To me that shows class. This movie is not one of her better efforts, it is still decent enough if you enjoy the '70s types of low budget, shot in ten days movies. Rothman's Group Marriage is much better (see my review on that one). If you are able to get this cheap enough, upgrade over your VHS copy and enjoy it for what it is. As much as I love Stephanie Rothman films, I am hesitant on giving this one the four stars I gave it. It is not one of her best, but I still liked it (plus its from a decent print). Thanks again Code Red for releasing movies no one else would dare!",1299456000,5,918,4.192090395480226
