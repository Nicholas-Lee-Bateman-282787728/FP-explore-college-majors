2485207,3,B000E372KO,"This was a good DVD.  However, as a critical diva, let me get my one criticism out of the way.  This work spends a long time on the De Lorean car.  The only time I ever saw that was in ""Back to the Future"" (and no, I never bothered to see the sequels, especially with Michael J. Fox's whiny, annoying voice).  I have never seen a person drive one nor talk of wanting one.  Perhaps there were few automotive technological innoverations in that decade, but that segment was a time killer.
This work is unique in two ways: it didn't just focus on the mechanical, engineering-based features of 80s inventions, but it also looked seriously at how these products were marketed.  So we learn how porn videos helped promote VCRs over Betamaxes, for example.  Again, this is science-y, so Teddy Ruxpin, ""The Breakfast Club,"" and Lionel Richie's ""Dancing on a Ceiling"" don't come up.
If electronic toys seem like they are the preoccupation of males, this work strokes that images as all the interviewees are male.  A whole bunch of them have chin dimples too, for some reason.
Still, you see walkmans, and Donkey Kong, and an 8-track being thrown away, so this will remind you of 20 years ago.  It is not humorous like VH-1's ""I Love the 80s.""  I'm not sure what viewers below the age of 25 would feel about seeing this.  But if you are older, you may really get a kick out of it.",1225756800,,1370,4.461847389558233
2485208,5,B000E372KO,"The average American consumes 43 lbs. of sugar each year, more than the Chinese, less than those in Australia.  (We also consume 65 lbs. of high fructose corn syrup each year.)

Sugar cane is a tropical grass grown by planting clones, not seeds.  Crops in Hawaii take two years to mature, reaching 30 feet in height and yielding 120 tons/acre.  (Ten lbs. of stalk creates 1-1.5 lbs. sugar.)

Stalks are first cleaned, then chopped into fine pieces, crushed, boiled and concentrated five times, spun in centrifuges (molasses is a by-product).

California grows sugar beets - these are ready one year after planting.  Machines dig under the roots and bring the 3-4 lb. beets up to the surface.  Processing is similar to that of cane sugar.  Additional sugar is taken from the molasses by a process introduced in 1995 and increasing overall sugar yield 25%.

Westerners discovered sugar as a result of the Crusades.  Columbus brought sugar to the New World.  There it accidentally led to the discovery of rum and the two products together created a demand for slaves.  According to ""Sugar,"" one of the reasons Britain withdrew from America was to concentrate on battling France for the West Indies and its sugar.

Raw sugar is brown (contains molasses), confectioners sugar is pure sugar ground into powder.  Sugar now is being used in cosmetics, as well as making cereal crisp, a source for rum, and an ingredient in ice cream, preservative in jam, and in countless foods and soft drinks outside the U.S.

High fructose corn syrup is used in American soft drinks because it is cheaper.  Brazil is now growing extensive sugar cane as a source of ethanol - costs half as much as gasoline.

The fibrous residue from sugar cane is used to generate power at sugar plants in Hawaii, as well as 7% of Maui's electricity.

Scientists now are experimenting with inserting DNA into sugar cane to grow human protein without the risk of host viruses crossing over.",1225238400,7,1950,4.836858006042296
2485209,4,B000E372KO,"We benefit when we learn about the things we take as a given.  This made me think deeply about the sugar I use frequently and to which I don't pay much attention.

I wondered how sugar could be discussed under a series called ""MODERN Marvels"" (my emphasis).  The program pays especial attention to the engineering and chemistry behind sugar production.  That's good for business and science types.  As a social science person, I was more interested in the history of sugar and this program provides info on that as well.

The program is very inclusive.  It speaks for sugar's byproducts (molasses and rum) as well as the competition for sugar.  The interviewees are male and female; white and of color; from the developed world and the developing world.  By showing both CEOs and factory workers, it tries to have a diverse, economic class presentation as well.  One Brazilian interviewee had large, thick eyebrows; one Californian scholar looked like actor Christopher Walken.

In discussing using sugar, rather than gas, in cars, I worried the program wouldn't talk about an environmental impact.  Luckily it does.  In talking about sugar production in the Caribbean, I worried that it would gloss over that sugar was harvested on the backs of African slaves.  It isn't afraid to touch upon that tragedy.

The work only mentions obesity in one sentence at the end.  It never mentions the command, ""Get the molasses out of your gluteus maximus.""  It doesn't reminisce about the time that Homer Simpson tried to sell sugar he found.

I'm a fatty, but this didn't make me want to buy sugar like the episode on candy made me hungry.",1179878400,8,1630,4.865454545454545

8104848,2,B000E372KO,I was expecting a longer historical view on sugar and was utterly disappointed that the role slavery played in sugar production and commodification is just glossed over in passing.,1295222400,,180,5.241379310344827
8104849,4,B000E372KO,"Integrated circuits (ICs) became cheap and prevalent in the 1980s, thanks to Moore's Law (power doubles in about 18 months).  Intel's 8088 chip (1981) had 29,000 transistors; its latest has 713 million.

Wozniak designed Apple's initial hardware and wrote the software as well; Jobs was the business mind.  Wozniak also developed GUI for Lisa, but it didn't sell well because it required lots of costly memory; later was updated to become the Macintosh.

ICs then brought arcade gaming, home games (eg. Atari), VCRs, the tape wars (Betamax's slightly better quality, vs. VHS' cheaper and longer, allowing an entire movie), Walkmans, CD players, Discman, camcorders, miniature headphones, and cell phones - all in the 1980s.  Sony was a leader in all, except VHS and cell phones.

DeLorean brought out his own car design - popular at first, then sales stalled because it was underpowered and overpriced.  Simon and Rubik's Cube were also immensely popular.

Bottom Line:  The 80s gave birth to numerous new products that are being further refined today.",1228176000,3,1052,5.177514792899408
