8018401,5,B0001YXYXU,"Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal are an unlikely duo in this spoofy remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"".  DeVito has a domineering mother he wants to get rid of and tries to strike a deal with Crystal, whose wife is cheating on him.  ""Tit for tat"", as DeVito puts it, hoping Crystal will kill his mother while DeVito kills Crystal's wife.  Lots of sight gags.  Not one of the best but it has it's moments.",1414886400,,419,4.402597402597403
