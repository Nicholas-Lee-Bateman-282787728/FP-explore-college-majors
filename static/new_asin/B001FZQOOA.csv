8303288,5,B001FZQOOA,"If you already know about Claude Vivier then you'll know why you want this disc. If you don't know his music and are interested in a fine presentation, buy this one. I'm a Vivier fan, it's obvious that this production was a great labor of love from the participants. Yes, there are other recordings of the works, some maybe ""better"", but for a comprehensive overview of his important works, this is the set.",1456876800,,407,4.589041095890411
8303289,3,B001FZQOOA,"The music that the French-Canadian composer Claude Vivier wrote in the years preceding his untimely death in 1983 is out of this world: eschewing polyphony, he worked with endless single melodies, wrapped in dazzling microtonal inflections that he called ""les couleurs"". Informed by his studies of both Western classical music and traditions from Asia, the music is a fresh synthesis where East meets West and is then channeled through Vivier's own modernist genius.

Vivier's work fell into obscurity, and it wasn't until the mid 1990s that he was rediscovered. The Amsterdam-based Schoenberg-Asko Ensemble, their conductor Reinbert de Leeuw and the soprano Susan Narucki took up this music and recorded some of it on a must-hear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-disc/dp/B0000041EX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips disc</a>. Then, in 2004, de Leeuw collaborated with director Pierre Audi in the Netherlands Opera stagings on this 2-disc set: Vivier's opera ""Kopernikus"" and a later array of pieces, some of which Vivier linked to the theme of Marco Polo.

For those entirely new to Vivier, Disc 1 of this set includes a documentary on his life and work made in 1996 as part of de Leeuw's ""Toonmeesters"" series for Dutch television, and this is a good place to start. It opens with the night of his death: Vivier, then living in Paris, had picked up a male prostitute in a bar, but the young man stabbed him to death and ran off with the paltry sum Viver had in his pocket. On the table was the still incomplete score of what would be Vivier's last piece, ""Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele?"" (Do You Believe in the Immortality of the Soul?). In this work for voices, some altered with electronics or extended techniques, Vivier tells of entering the Paris metro late at night and being drawn to a handsome man in the otherwise empty car: after a brief conversation, the narrator says, ""Then he removed a dagger from his jacket and stabbed me through the heart."" A ghastly coincidence, no? In making the document de Leeuw interviews a number of people close to Vivier in both Canada and Europe, who are upfront about his complex personality (both his unabashed homosexuality and sadly the fact he was rather a lech, his perennial obsession with music, finding new sounds and learning new languages). De Leeuw's enthusiasm for this music which went neglected for so long is infectious. There is some also footage of the Schoenberg-Asko Ensemble performing the late works.

The hour-long opera ""Kopernikus: Rituel de la mort"" (1979) fills the rest of Disc 1. While this was written just before his discovery of ""les couleurs"", it already eschews polyphony and pays hommage to the exotic music Vivier had heard in Asia. Despite what the title may lead you to except, this opera has little to do with the Prussian astronomer who revolutioned our understanding of the heavens. Instead, it concerns a woman named Agni who calls on historical and mythical figures: Lewis Carroll, Merlin, a witch, the Queen of the Night, a blind prophet, an old monk, Tristan, Isolde, Mozart, the Lord of the Waters, and finally Copenicus and his mother. In spite of some buffo action in the staging, there's not much of a concrete plot to this.

Disc 2 is dedicated most of Vivier's late output and his truly mature career, an ""opera fleuve"" on Marco Polo. It opens with a brief fragment of ""Glaubst du"" before proceeding through ""Prologue pour un Marco Polo"" for narrator, voices and ensemble (1981), ""Shiraz"" for solo piano"" (1977), ""Lonely Child"" for soprano and ensemble (1980), ""Zipangu"" for strings (1980), ""Wo Bist du Licht!"" for mezzo-soprano, strings and tape (1981), and finally ""Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele?"" in its (poignantly incomplete) entirety. The vocal writing becomes increasingly effusive, with techniques like hand tremolos (i.e. the ""Indian war whoop"" that children make), the Japanese percussion instrument called a rin is prominent, and ""les couleurs"" are just to die for.

As this is a production by the controversial director Pierre Audi, you can expect bizzare staging decisions that arguably bear no resemblance whatsoever to the composer's intentions. The costumes by Angelo Figus are risible. The supporting cast is wearing thick layers of random fabric that makes it look like their heads are sticking out of bags. A few are reminiscent of early 1990s New York club kids (indeed, one bears a resemblance to James St. James). For some reason, the entire ensemble and conductors are wearing priests' collars.  The movement of the figures across the stage doesn't seem to have any especial purpose or relation to the text.

Vivier's music needs more exposure: this is music that should appeal to a wide audience, and yet it seems to constantly be forgotten. Unfortunately, I fear the visuals of this 2-disc set will turn a lot of people off. I know that Audi has his following, but I'm not sure how much it overlaps with those who are already fans of Vivier or could potentially become fans. I was excited to find that the set is in 5.1 surround sound, but the quality of the performances are not quite up to the aforementioned Philips disc or the long out-of-print Vivier box set from Radio Canada.

Still, it is exciting to see how the virtuoso piano piece ""Shiraz"" is played, the performance of ""Zipangu"" is better than the competition and as I write this, the set has been reduced to budget price (not widely advertised, it seems to have not sold well). So, fans of modern music should still take a chance on it. But take my advice is doing whatever you can to get ahold of the earlier Philips disc.",1370476800,2,5686,5.0095238095238095
8303290,5,B001FZQOOA,"... would be an apt description of the music of Claude Vivier (1948-1983) whether you love it or hate it. It would depend, I suppose, on your attitude toward be harrowed. Claude Vivier was not in the least concerned with amusing you, either as a solitary listener or as an audience. His larger theatrical works - Kopernikus and Marco Polo - are explicitly intended as ""rituals"" rather than entertainments. The stagings of those two works, recorded live at the Gasholder Cultuurpark Westergasfabriek in Amsterdam, are ""realizations"" of Vivier's rituals by conductor Reinbert de Leeuw and stage director Pierre Audi. Performed in bizarre costumes and masks amid towering industrial scaffolds, they are not for the sybarites of the public. The sounds and the scenes are grim, even ugly at times, with very little that suggests traditional musical rhyme or reason. Much of the singing is in an imaginary language, un-subtitled obviously, and the singers employ extreme techniques - chanting through tubes, patting their mouths like Iroquois war-whoops - mixed with 'Sprachstimme' and poetic recitation. The texts in French and German are, thank you!, subtitled. Most of them are Vivier's own words, but there are quotations of Friedrich Hlderlin and Martin Luther King. The characters in Kopernikus include Lewis Carroll, Merlin, Tristan and Isolde, Mozart and the Queen of the Night, Copernicus and Copernicus's mother; you'll need to be quick with allusions, however, to identify them. The staging of ""Marco Polo"" is an assemblage of shorter works from Vivier's last years of life: the dramatic ritual Prologue dissolves into the solo piano opus Shiraz, followed by the vocal Lonely Child, the orchestral Zipangu, the vocal Wo bist du, Licht, and then the agonizing Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Do you believe in the immortality of the Soul), Vivier's final composition in which he uncannily predicts his own death, being murdered by a stranger. That composition was found on Vivier's desk in Paris when his body was discovered; he was stabbed to death by a 19-year-old male prostitute he'd picked up at a bar. Vivier's music is ""all about"" existential terror, fear of and long for Death, loneliness and ""otherness."" You can be forgiven if you don't wish to be harrowed. I usually don't, myself, but I'm compelled to experience Vivier's ritual anguish by the originality of his music.

If you don't like the music of Gyrgy Ligeti and can't appreciate Karlheinz Stockhausen, there's zero chance that you'll esteem Claude Vivier. Ligeti was Vivier's first champion, and Stockhausen was his reluctant teacher. Vivier's disturbing personality made Stockhausen wary of him. In the end, Vivier took his existentialist modernism farther out, emotionally, than either Ligeti or Stockhausen ... or anyone else that I could name. After Vivier, what? Actual rape, self-mutilation, and human sacrifice are still illegal on stages even in the Netherlands.

If you decide to risk the experience of ""Dreams of a Marco Polo,"" I have a couple of recommendations. Disc 1 includes Kopernikus and a 66-minute documentary on the life of the Montreal orphan who became Claude Vivier, featuring extended explications of his music by conductor Reinbert de Leeuw. I urge you to watch that documentary first! Then watch Disc 2, which includes Vivier's most persuasive music and which is a more vivid ""ritual"" than the sparse and ghastly Kopernikus. Save Kopernikus for last. Don't expect a balmy evening.

The pianist who plays Shiraz is Marc Couroux; he makes this outer-limit composition completely convincing. The vocal and instrumental performers are the asko Ensemble and the Schnberg Ensemble, with conventional orchestral strings and winds, synthesizers, and a vast panoply of percussion. It's not as chaotic as it sounds ... but it is harrowing.",1369872000,2,3841,5.262642740619902
