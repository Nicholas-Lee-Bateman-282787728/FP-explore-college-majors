8484085,5,B005R3BS6K,"From Paramount studios, this film, with its improbable plot of a wild, rogue elephant terrorizing the countryside, was nevertheless a slambang action film with a stalwart hero (Richard Denning), gorgeous heroine (Dorothy Lamour in her prime) and various sidekicks and character actors which were richly woven into studio productions of that era.  It keeps one's attention and has an edge of your seat ending.  Memorable entertainment from the Hollywood studio system.  Worthy of being broadcast on TCM and, most especially, being re-issued from the Paramount studio vaults.",1408233600,2,573,5.563218390804598
