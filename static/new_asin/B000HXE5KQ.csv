8142256,5,B000HXE5KQ,"We watch this DVD about once a month to cure our longing to be in the Isle of Man.  The narrator hasn't become annoying yet, and the music is quite good and varied.  The scenery is typically Manx - beautiful seascapes, landscapes and many tourist attractions, including the unique modes of transportation.  It's hard to classify this DVD - it's got a little of everything.  I recommend it.",1377993600,,389,4.676470588235294
