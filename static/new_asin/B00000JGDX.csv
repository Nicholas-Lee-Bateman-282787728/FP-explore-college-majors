1232219,5,B00000JGDX,Excellent black and white photography and first rate performances all round make this an entertaining thriller. John Saxon is well cast as one of a trio of scientists determined to discover what secrets a glowing sphere  from outer space hold.

1232230,5,B00000JGDX,"Night Caller, a British science fiction/mystery movie released in 1965, has an American version as well. The only difference in the American version is the opening musical score. The American version lacks the musical score ""Image""  played by Alan Haven (organ, with orchestra). You can find the ""Image"" title music on YouTube. The American musical score at the beginning of the film is  not worth mentioning. The way they did the American version of Night Caller, reminds me of what they did with the original Godzilla movie. They didn't do a good job, but that's another story. Night Caller aka ""Blood Beast from Outer Space"" and ""Night Caller from Outer Space"", has a good story which is very intelligent, good cast, and a good plot. The ending will surprise you. The DVD is presented in glorious black and white in full screen format. I have no knowledge of a widescreen version of the movie produced on DVD.

The story starts with scientists in a science lab. One of the scientist discovers on radar a ufo object  traveling at over 10,000 miles per hour. The UFO soon lands on wasteland just outside London. At first it is suspected that the object is a meteorite, but soon they realized the object is under intelligent control. Meanwhile, The army track it down and bring in two of the scientists. Convinced that it was a spacecraft, they're surprised to discover a small sphere, the size of a football, sitting on the ground. There's no crater, so it must have been guided down. The British army and scientist take the space object to the science lab and hold it  for further tests. Inside the lab, surrounded by the army for security, the scientists discover that, late at night, the object glows intensely. What dark secrets does this object spere possesses? And, more importantingly, why did it come to earth, and where did it come from?

Seeing a good copy of The Night Caller is getting easier. The first DVD was the NTSC region 1 Image Entertainment DVD  It's a slightly censored version, with an alternate shot that covers up nudie magazines in the Soho 'bookshop'. More damagingly, it has an awful and dated song over the opening credits, replacing the atmospheric `northern soul' instrumental of the version (see above) One of my favourite movie theme tunes ever! The instrumental is again called ""Image"" and is credited to Joe Glenn, Larry Greene and Bob Sande, and is played by Alan Haven.

I bought my DVD from Renown Pictures, LTD (UK). You can find the web site at [...]. At this site you will find the original Night Caller DVD uncensored which you can order online. This DVD contains the opening scene with the ""Image"" musical score. This current DVD has a first ever color version, and the black and white version is included. Enjoy!

1232231,4,B00000JGDX,"Night Caller from Outer Space with John Saxon reminded me of another B/W sci-fi movie from my youth that had a ""learn from our mistake of destroying our own planet"" message:  The Day the Earth Stood Still.

1232232,2,B00000JGDX,"The British seem to have a way of making science fiction boring. The theme song alone should tip off the viewer that this is not going to be a good movie.  It sounds like a pop tune instead of an eerie sounding music that would set the tone for a film of this nature. This movie was supposed to be about Alien abduction of young women.  The alien had reportedly abducted 21 women.  However,the movie never showed a single female abduction.  Instead the evil alien kills the heroine(not pretty) and a learned professor(an egghead).  The hero John Saxon may as well have not even been in this film because he doesn't do anything heroic. A waste of talent.  The authorities track the alien down and then allow him to fly away without any provocation.  The movie is slow moving and dull.  Unless you like other British Sci-Fi dull-fests like Doctor Who or They came from Outer Space, don't waste your money on this one.  This is a very disappointing movie.",1302825600,,952,4.552941176470588
1232233,4,B00000JGDX,"There have been many good reviews about this odd little film already by fellow IMDB users.

One note of interest however, is that very unfortunately the new crisp release of 'The Night Caller' has omitted the fantastic opening (UK)score to the film.

""Image"" was recorded by Alan Haven; A superb musician who specialised in Hammond Organ, the opening scenes have a tracking shot over London by night and the music on original U.K. release, perfectly captures the essence of Mid-sixties Britain.

The piece has a spooky organ mix set to a mod (ish) and orchestral background, it has become a bit of a 'Northern Soul' classic in the UK having been released in Britain in February 1965!

Great shame then, that the USA release has a totally inappropriate male vocalist-romantic-lounge piece SINGING the title track!

For those who haven't heard the UK original you'd be very pleasantly surprised...",1169856000,11,895,5.02027027027027

1232235,4,B00000JGDX,"Truth be told, the only reason I bought this movie was because my favorite actor, John Carson, was in it.  All in all, it's a fun movie to watch when you want just that - a fun movie to watch.  The plot was certainly different, the ending was VERY odd, but all in all, it was fun.  John Saxon was an odd casting to this - I wasn't really sure if he was supposed to be ""British"" because sometimes he had a slight accent, while other times he didn't.  The only thing I didn't like was that my favorite guy was killed.  The quality of the picture was amazingly fantastic - very crisp and clear!  I've got DVD's of television shows and movies made today and the quality is nothing like this.  The quality alone of the picture is 5 Stars!  Enjoy and just have fun watching it!",1140652800,4,771,4.162162162162162
1232236,5,B00000JGDX,"I am a huge fan of B-Movies from the 1950s to the present, and when I saw the cover art (surely a near reproduction of the original theater poster) I highly suspected that this would be a first class piece of cheese.
I was wrong.
This film is an extremely well made black and white psychological thriller from the mid 1960s. It is taut, has good (for the day) special effects, a plausible story line, genuine suspense, and excellent acting, especially by the young John Saxon (much better than his later role opposite Joe Don Baker in ""Mitchell"" that MST3K fans would be better acquainted with.) The story concerns an object from Ganymede (a moon of Jupiter) which is an energy door which allows a being, the night caller of the title, to come to Earth. The night caller sets up a system to recruit women (via ads in 'Bikini Girl' magazine!) to return to Ganymede with him. The plot is well executed, and keeps tension high throughout. The conclusion proves both dramatic and cautionary about the future of Earth, and is not overdone with the histrionics so common today.
I liked this film for totally different reasons than I expected to. Although frequently lumped in with other monster movies from that era, this film is well executed, well acted, and suspenseful from start to finish.",1086739200,15,1288,4.70353982300885
1232237,4,B00000JGDX,"Ganymede (""GAN uh meed""), in case you weren't aware, is the seventh and largest of Jupiter's known satellites and third of the Galilean moons.  It's also the name of a Trojan boy of great beauty whom Zeus carried away to be cup bearer to the gods.  In the case of The Night Caller (1965), my reference relates to the very real moon and not the mythological figure.
This British film, directed by the prolific and well known John Gilling, stars John Saxon as Dr. Jack Costain, an American scientist working in a research facility in England.  While doing some routine research work, an object is observed traveling to Earth.  What makes it so strange is that it appears not to be a random piece of space flotsam, but an object guided by some unseen force.  The military is also aware of the object, having tracked its' decent, has concern that it may be an atomic device from an unfriendly country, so they are actively seeking the mysterious widget.  Once found, the mystery deepens as the orb, about the size of a bowling ball, is comprised of an unknown material and has a temperature of below zero.
After a couple of incidents, one involving a death, the cosmic bowling ball vanishes, and young women from the area begin disappearing.  The women all seem to have a common link in that they answered an ad in a magazine, one that is calling for attractive women to model on television, promotional advertising, and such, and a strangely garbed individual calling himself Mr. Medra.  As the police search for clues, Dr. Costain feels that the timing of the disappearance of the space orb and the missing girls are linked, along with this shady Medra character.  The police, with the help of Dr. Costain, begin to put the pieces together, and the hunt for Medra begins.  Will they learn the true nature of the sphere, Medra, and the missing girls?  If you've read the cover of the box, you've probably already deduced that Medra is an alien and he is kidnapping the women to take back to his planet, Ganymede, so I don't think I am really giving anything away.  For what purpose, though?
The Night Caller is listed as a horror/sci-fi film, but it has a strong element of mystery throughout as the police and Dr. Costain try to track down this Medra, and learn of the nature of his appearance on Earth, and for what purpose he needs the women.  The casting of John Saxon in the lead role seems an odd one, but I suppose it was done to help the film sell within the US, as similarly done with other British productions like The Quatermass Experiment (1955) and The Trollenberg Terror (1958), starring American actors Brian Donlevy (actually, Donlevy was sort of a transplanted American, being born in Ireland but immigrating to the US early in his life) and Forrest Tucker, respectively.  The science fiction portion is obvious, but certainly competes with the mystery element of the story.  The horror aspect is not really in a visual sense, but more of an underlying theme as we are unaware of what purpose the women will serve, and if they will ever be seen again.  The reference of the Night Caller is because the character Medra always stayed in the shadows, appearing only at night, and wore dark garments further shrouding himself in darkness.  The box would appear to make this look like a cheap, schlocky, run of the mill science fiction feature, but when I saw that Gilling had directed it, I took a bit more interest in it, as I knew I would, at the very least, get an visually entertaining story.  Not only that, but it's pretty intelligent and has a light smattering of comedy (the part where the police and Dr. Costain interview the parents of one of the missing girls is rife with your classical, dry British humor).  I found surprising a few of the plot twists within the film, and found it interesting that the story developed the way it did. What really shocked (well, maybe not so much shocked, but more startled) me was the way the film ended.  I didn't see it coming, and, while some may be unsatisfied with it, I thought it was a pretty gutsy move, going against the some of the conventions I am used to seeing in other science fiction films of the time.
Image Entertainment provides a really good looking print here in full screen format.  I am unsure if this was the original aspect ratio, but it shows very little, if any signs of wear and tear.  Also provided are fairly detailed listing of filmographies of director Gilling and Saxon, looking like complete listings, rather than `selected' listings as I am used to seeing whenever a disc has this feature.  By the way, love that opening song sung in classical Las Vegas lounge style...you wouldn't think serious science fiction and cheesy lounge music could mix...and you'd be right.

A large plastic ball transports an alien to earth from one of Jupiters moons, where he poses as an agent for ""Bikini today"" to ensnare attractive young women.

7912113,4,B00000JGDX,"Very good mid-60's British-made sci-fi film.  Scientists and the military recover a small beach-ball sized sphere that comes from ""OUT THERE"".  Weird happenings occur at the facility where it's being examined, then the sphere disappears along with whatever came out of it.  After a few weeks the cops call in the scientists because young women are disappearing under strange circumstances and it's believed that the sphere traveler is responsible.  Turns out that the space creep is from Ganymede, one of Jupiter's giant moons.  It seems that ""Ganymede Needs Women"".  A long time back Ganymede had an atomic war and it is only now that the inhabitants are starting to recover.  But it seems that they need fresh, pure female genes to clean up their physiology.  Someone should tell them they would need clean male genes as well.  We never see the Ganymedian, named Medra, until the end.  He has a claw hand, one side of his face is classically handsome, the other side all messed up.  Poor captive girls, having to wake up to that in the morning.  I don't think these E.T.'s have learned their lesson yet.  Medra is incredibly snooty, thinking his people are infinitely superior.  Well they nearly wiped themselves out with nukes, so how are they better than us?  Anyway Medra achieves his mission and escapes with his captive women.  One of the better British sci-fi flicks, crisp black-and-white photography, and a non-camp story.  The opening title song is good but doesn't seem to fit the genre.  I have the Image Entertainment DVD and it is excellent quality though it is very hard to find now. It has very little in the way of extras.  Highly recommended.",1522454400,,1661,4.846975088967971

7912116,2,B00000JGDX,"What a downer of a movie.  It started out promising but ended up in a confused, muddled mess.  It also lacked a sense of justice that should have been in the movie.  At first the Night Caller does not intentionally kill anyone.  Then he accidentally kills someone.  Then he purposefully kills someone who was trying to communicate with him and he justifies it by saying he ""destroys what he can't control."" Finally at the end of the movie he gives some kind of ""holier than thou"" speech about his race being better than ours but they just take what they want yet claim their victims will be well-treated, even though he has killed innocents and shows not a smidgen of remorse for it.  So, he expects us to believe him?  Not likely.

Also, as another reviewer has said, John Saxon's presence in the movie is wasted.  He is supposedly the lead yet he does nothing heroic or does anything to bring the bad guy to justice or stop him. There was really no reason for him to be in the movie. It's too bad about this movie.

The unseen space creep commits a series of grisly and gratuitous murders and when finally cornered, delivers a self-righteous speech about the future of mankind and how we'd better straighten up, a la Klaatu in The Day The Earth Stood Still.

7912121,2,B00000JGDX,"Variously known as THE NIGHT CALLER, NIGHT CALLER FROM OUTER SPACE, and BLOOD BEAST FROM OUTER SPACE, this 1965 English film opens with a placard that certifies it for display to audiences of sixteen years or older. Precisely why is quite a mystery: in truth the film is more likely to induce slumber than frighten children.

After opening with a ridiculous theme song, the film takes us to a laboratory where three scientists note a falling meteor that they soon suspect isn't a meteor at all. Once found, the object resembles a fiberglass globe of the sort one might have seen in the tackier trailers of the 1960s. In any case, and through much scientific doubletalk, the scientists conclude that it is a sort of interplanetary ""valve"" sent to the earth and then used to transport an alien life form to and from its home planet. Indeed, an alien does appear, and in short order dozens of women turn up missing. Soon scientists and police are working together to prevent these innocent women from being transported to Ganymede. Yes, Ganymede.

Now and then one encounters a bad movie that is so brazen in its awfulness that it is fun to watch. But most bad movies are simply bad, and THE NIGHT CALLER is that. It's not in the same league with MANOS: HANDS OF FATE (but then few things are), but it's dull enough to cause your eyes to glaze over. If you are a fan of bad English B-level horror movies, watch it by all means ... but most others should give it a miss.
