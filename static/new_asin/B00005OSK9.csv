7949107,2,B00005OSK9,"The plot surrounding FLOP is rather simple. A middle age  teacher attracts one of his felloes by the proposition of a gay book to read (Maurice, by J.M.Foster) while maintaining some distance of him, in views of their differences in expectations of live and age. And the film doesnt go very away from this plot, giving little, if one, intrinsically movements of why this relationship is faded to fail.
Both actors perform not very well. The Teacher (Edmond Strode) is constantly trying to be though; the student (Alex Wong) fells, or pretends to feel, the pains of first love. And so they go through the film, giving a boring conflict of generations.
As a hole, the film doesnt need more than the 50 attributed to it. It can lead to some reflection of the problems of love with such a difference of age, but that won't last a few minutes after the film is closed. Very boring.",1481328000,,876,4.579617834394904

7949109,4,B00005OSK9,"You don't need flashy direction and big budgets when you have interesting characters, tangible dilemmas, and troubled human relationships. Here is a good example. A quiet love story taking place in Hong Kong between Hugh, a 49 year old professor of English literature and his Chinese student, 19 year old Mark.
The two men are from very different worlds. Hugh is a neurotic character, sensing that his life is slipping away from him. He is writing a play about a long-lost love-affair, but can't get it published. This frustrates him no end, and he has problems concentrating on his job at the University.
Into his life enters Mark, a polite, intelligent Chinese boy, very Confucian, but he seems more sure of himself. He wants Hugh badly, but Hugh is keeping a distance. The key scene happens near the end, when a failed phone-call proves critical.
This film benefits from several viewings. The people grow on you, and what seems like stiff acting is actually restraint, modesty, a reluctance to let themselves go. The good manners of Chinese culture is very much in evidence in Mark and Hugh. Yet, this doesn't retract from the movie, it merely allows you to project you own emotions into the characters. Very Checkovian, you might say.
As for the gay content, expect nothing explicit. But other than that, this is very good indeed.
Note: The film lasts 50 minutes.",1025568000,31,1367,4.846153846153846
