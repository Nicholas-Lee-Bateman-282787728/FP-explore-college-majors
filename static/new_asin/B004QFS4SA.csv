The graph of the narrative is low as the film begins and is the same till the intermission point. Just like Sonal's condition, you desperately want the film to get better. And it does! After the interval, the twist shown elevates the narrative to a great extent. Just as you feel Ganesh has finally steadied the sinking ship, it plummets and again goes haywire. The hurried climax doesn't help.

There are flimsy scenes like Abhay taking on several policemen single handedly. Don't the police officers have guns? Then there's Sonal doing a Mere Khwabon mein jo aaye tackily. The numerous songs, most of them shot in foreign locations don't add any value. Amjad Nadeem's music is passable. Aseem Bajaj's cinematography is decent. Nilesh Naik's editing is good.",1300665600,,889,4.926666666666667
