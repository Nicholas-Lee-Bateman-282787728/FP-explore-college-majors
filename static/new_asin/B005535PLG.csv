8457315,5,B005535PLG,"Outstanding series. Don Hany is a fantastic Australian Dramatic Actor. One of the best I have come across.
I would also recommend Don Hany's other DVD series ""Serangoon Road"" (also available at Amazon).
I would rate him and the series as good as they come. While the Box  says video is in a Non-USA PAL format, It plays perfect
on my Laptop PC (running Linux). No special adjustments required.",1463097600,,393,4.695652173913044

8457319,1,B005535PLG,"This is a great idea that is horribly executed. The multicultural clash is defined in clumsy strokes and the drama is circa 1970's American cop show. I was bored fairly quickly in, but powered through knowing that some shows need a moment to get to their feet. I was not happy that I at the end and you are talking to someone who loves the genre so much that I want it all to work.",1422144000,,381,4.093333333333334

8457321,5,B005535PLG,"Season 3 of East West 101 starts off with a dramatic armoured van robbery and then just accelerates as the key detective Malik begins to sort out the crime.  Season 3 is the final season in the series so I won't spoil the end.  Needless to say it was all filmed on location on the streets of Sydney and they captured the multicultural society perfectly.  This TV series has won many awards, Australian and international and is certainly worth checking out.",1313366400,4,456,4.604938271604938
