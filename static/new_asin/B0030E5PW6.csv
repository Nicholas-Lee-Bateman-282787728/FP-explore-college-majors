A lot of the scenes were filmed in my hometown Elyria,Ohio which is twenty-five miles west of Cleveland. It was a surprise to almost everyone when Jerry Springer entered the stage where we were rehearsing in Cleveland. We had to keep everything hush-hush until the movie was released. If you like to make fun of politics you will like this movie.",1270080000,,476,4.241758241758242
