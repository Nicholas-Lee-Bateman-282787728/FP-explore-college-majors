8113139,5,B000EQ5UWI,"My-Hime is one of those animes that you come across usually by accident. When that happened to me I thought, ""where the heck have they been hiding this one all these years?"" It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

This anime is great. It has a good mixture of emotion and action. You should definitely check it out.",1354752000,,1072,4.414141414141414
8113140,5,B000EQ5UWI,"a wonderous opera that will help you understand love even if you thought you already did. I recommend everyone that has a passion for anime to see this and also those that don't too, and if someone would make a live action movie to this story it would be something great (no changing the story-line for ratings, etc.)",1336780800,,317,4.482758620689655
8113141,4,B000EQ5UWI,"It was great to see more Hime show themselves... and man was there some crazy twists...

If you haven't seen the first disc you should before you watch this one... funny and adventurous series",1154044800,,192,4.647058823529412
8113142,4,B000EQ5UWI,". . . Be prepared for a problem with episode 7. I've owned four different discs of volume 2. Episodes 5, 6, and 8 play fine but episode 7 won't play at all, it's so pixilated. It makes following the otherwise intriguing storyline (and great animation)difficult.",1152576000,2,261,4.695652173913044
8113143,5,B000EQ5UWI,"Mai Tokiha is getting more used to life at Fuka Academy, even if she still has to wake up every morning with Mikoto clinging to her breasts!  In addition to looking out for Mikoto and working a part-time job as a waitress, she also has to keep on eye on her sickly brother, Takumi. Along with all this goes the additional pressure of being a Hime, a role which Mai is struggling to reject. She just wants to be a normal high school student. But events are shaping her destiny that are beyond her control. As she faces a lethal battle with an Orphan, Midori, her co-worker, reveals herself as a Hime, and saves her life. Midori, unlike Mai relishes her powers, almost too much....She seems to enjoy it like a cosplayer...but at least she's having fun...too bad she's an alcoholic! Even though she says she's only 17, she's a bit older. Some other Hime also join the cast, some with a more negative bent than others, who use their powers to serve their own sense of justice instead of battling to save the world.

Volume 2 of My-Hime further deepens not only the plot but the characters. The Hime seem to be wrestling with what to do with their powers. Whether to serve unknown agents and be controlled, use the power for selfish reasons, or to simply ignore them! Mai, at this point, wants to forget the whole problem and just get on with her life. But she isn't going to get her wish. The plot is still a little fuzzy, but gives just enough info to refrain from being frustrating. At this early stage, the writers are concentrating more on building up the characters. In terms of animation, this series is pretty top-notch, and the characters are realistically designed with a sexy edge. My-Hime is a keeper!",1148515200,6,1708,4.524271844660194
