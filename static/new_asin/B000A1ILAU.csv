8072135,1,B000A1ILAU,"What a horrible, bloody & pointless production
I wasted my time & money watching it.
Bearing in mind that I hardly ever bother entering comments about movies I watch, I feel so strongly about this one, that I decided posting this entry in order to warn others to stay away from this movie!.",1423440000,,290,4.490566037735849

8072137,2,B000A1ILAU,"Brat packer C. Thomas Howell has matured as a nice looking fellow, but unfortuntely LAST LIVES is not a showcase for any acting talent the man may have.

In this one, we have parallel worlds in which a convicted killer is convinced that a bride to be in the other world is destined to be his bride.  So he and two ruthless killers are transported into her world, shoot up her wedding and kidnap the unsuspecting bride.  One major gimmick is that Howell is provided with life bands from the mad scientist that enable him to die and come back to life.

This isn't a bad premise but the acting and execution are just subpar.  Jennifer Ruben as the heroine; Judge Reinhold as the wacky professor, and especially Billy Wirth as Malakai, the nutcase, are just terrible in their roles and the movie's low budget doesn't help either.

For diehard scifi fans only.",1167868800,9,855,4.555555555555555
