196485,5,1578214696,The added bonus of Stuart Whitman's commentary makes this DVD even more enjoyable. He has an easy going style and let's us in on a few tidbits of his life before and after his 7 year contract with Fox. Highly recommended.,1013212800,10,221,4.414634146341464
196486,5,1578214696,"Arguably the best performance of Stuart Whitman's career, one wonders why he didn't win the Oscar for his sensitive portrayal. A film that leaves one thinking long after the closing credits.",935539200,8,190,5.161290322580645
196487,5,1578214696,"I have seen this movie once, in a cheap hotel on a business trip, late at night, over ten years ago.  I remember it still.  The movie covers the offence, treatment and rehabilitation of a paedophile. Be warned, it is not  to everyone's taste.  I discussed it with friends who were violently  opposed to the subject.  Me too, but the movie is still riveting - and  unique (in my experience).  It leaves the final question to answer yourself  - can such an offender be cured?",929059200,14,473,4.470588235294118
7799173,5,1578214696,"This was an elusive film I had been looking for many years, I originally owned it on Goodtimes Video back in the 80s, but could not find a DVD release until just recently. This was a daring film to make, a pedaphilia just released from prison. I was revolted by the subject matter, but Stuart Whitman gave such a nuanced Oscar nominated performance as the luckless Jim, I felt pity toward him. Although I have doubts about his conversion to heterosexual love, if it could actually happen. Rod Steiger added another bravura performance to his resume as his psychiatrist and Maria Schell was lovely. All in all a film that should not be missed but I can see where it would maintain a selective audience. Definitely a controversial film but very worthwhile.",1503446400,,754,4.71969696969697

7799176,1,1578214696,This movie was disturbing because it tries to convince the viewer that child molesters are curable people.  NOT SO!!!  Was this man really a child molester?  In the book he did molest the child so - yes he was.  The idea that suddenly he could love a woman and not be attracted to a child was absolutely absurd.  The script must have been written by someone who either knew a molester or was one himself and was trying to convince the public that this was a curable disease caused by childhood trauma.  WRONG AGAIN!  Stuart Whitman was excellent in the film but that's about all I can say that's positive about this movie.,1427068800,,622,4.451327433628318
7799177,2,1578214696,"I watched this film on TCM, never having seen it before. It had a 4 star rating in the capsule description.

This is a very dated film, and I did not find it to be believable at all in today's world. Was it a believable film in 1961? Maybe. But I do not believe it has aged well.

It is chock full of Freudian nonsense (which held some sway in 1961). The ""crime"" of which the protagonist was convicted was child molestation (or something along those lines). We are not shown the trial, but the flashback to the crime evidences no actual molestation of any sort. It seems to show him taking the 10 yr old girl (who he knows) on a ride in his car without her parents permission, and she wants to go with him at first. Then she cries and wants to go home. He eventually drives her home, and it is night-time. That's it.  Seems more like a kidnapping, if anything. So, the film does not present the crime of ""child molestation"" as we would view it today. Did 1961 society view this as child molestation?

The protagonist gets out of jail after 3 yrs (on parole). He is set up with a nice executive job  -- again, not believable at all. Not in today's world, anyway. Flashbacks show him in jail with other prisoners during group therapy sessions.  All the prisoners are wearing suits and ties! The therapy sessions are not at all believable (for 1961 or now). After starting work the day after he's out of prison, he befriends the boss's secretary, and she becomes his girlfriend. She knows he was released from prison, yet never do they discuss what his crime was. Never.  This is simply not credible. This is what leads to his downfall, in the sense that she has no qualms about him hanging out with her 10 yr old daughter. He goes to a carnival with his girlfriend's young daughter (at the girlfriend's request), while the girlfriend fixes dinner. A newspaperman photographs the two and writes a devastating front-page article about the ""child molester"" hanging out with another child. (This is at least 3 or 4 yrs after the original ""crime"".) The idea that this would be a front page article with full-page photo just seems ridiculous today. Was it ""true"" to 1961 standards? I don't know, but I doubt it. If it correctly reflects the times, then all we can say is, this film reflects the times but is strictly a period piece. How the times have changed! Today's world would bears little resemblance to the world depicted in this film.

The film drags a bit, and it lacks any believability. The actual subject matter is still relevant today ( Can a ""child molester"" be cured? Can society accept a ""cured child molester"" back into society?). But, this film is too dated to speak to the subject as it presents itself in today's world.",1424217600,,2730,4.501010101010101
7799178,5,1578214696,"Excellent film! Extremely well acted by everyone in the cast. Rod Steiger gives a jewel of a performance. Stuart Whitman remarkably underplays a psychopath on his way to healing, thus humanizing  him. The direction was superb and carefully crafted. I think this is one of the best but least recognized films of all time. As a ""social problem"" film it doesn't preach but portrays universal traits and struggles honestly and tastefully.",1406160000,,434,5.112676056338028
7799179,2,1578214696,"This film about a ""cured"" sexual predator could not have been made today and it's hard to see how it was made in 1960. Whitman and Schell give fine performances but the premise of a reformed child molester having a relationship with a widow with a young daughter is highly offensive. They present Whitman as ""The Mark"" being hounded by the press simply because he is a convicted child molester. How or why any one would want to view his character as sympathetic is unfathomable. I can't help but wonder about anyone who would choose to make a film that sees the predator as victim.",1392940800,,581,4.542857142857143
7799180,5,1578214696,"If you are lucky enough to acquire this film to watch, then you are indeed lucky.  And then watch it at least 3 times: once to engross yourself in the story; a second time to listen director Guy Green's accompanying cinematic comments; and a third time to enjoy Stuart Whitman's conversation about the film and how it impacted his career and his life.  This is a compelling drama that impacts the viewer to this day, with a perfect combination of dialogue and tension among the characters, beautifully played by Whitman, Maria Schell and Rod Steiger.  Whitman plays it with commanding restraint, allowing us to be fully  sympathetic for Jim Fuller as he struggles to re-build his life, cheering him at his little successes, worrying for him at each drawback, and hoping that he will have the strength to make it through. The Whitman-Steiger scenes are excellent and display a wonderful therapist-patient relationship.  Steiger's Dr. McNally refuses to have all the answers, encourages and cajoles and chides when he has to. Schell's Ruth Leighton is a woman full of her own hurt and hope, and her sensitively portrayed role is the perfect balance to Whitman's sensitive character.  With Cinemascope literally surrounding this story we are treated to black and white elegance in film hardly seen these days.  The sets are lovingly created and detailed - check out McNally's crammed yet oh-so-lifelike office.  Shadows and light - and rain - are all crisp.  Dissolving scenes move us easily from one moment to the other, and allow the 2-hour timeframe to quickly go by.  This film is a treasure - no one should miss it.  Whitman earned a Best Actor Nomination for his performance, and it is deserved.",1360713600,6,1698,4.922807017543859
7799181,5,1578214696,Stuart Whitman received an Academy Award for his performance as a guilt-ridden child molester.  He revealed a sensitivity which was never seen again in his Westerns.,1282608000,6,165,5.346153846153846
7799182,5,1578214696,"Very fine acting thoughout and well done in that it enables you to empathize with someone who came close to committing an act that would place him in the minds of many people on a lower, more subhuman plane than a cold blooded murderer.

But was this person truly a pedophile?  After all, he did not molest the girl child when he easily could have done so, and, if memory serves me correctly, returned her to the place where he abducted her.  Moreover, the film suggests that he was moved to commit this act by his feelings of indequacy and inhibition with mature women, not because he really sexually preferred children, or even that he was necessarily attracted that way to children at all. On the other hand, maybe many people in the early sixties thought that men became pedophiles simply because they couldn't cut the mustard with women rather than being fundamentally more attracted to children than adults.  One might ask in light of today's knowledge about child molesters whether it is psychologically possible for someone to molest a child primarily out of feelings of inadequacy and inhibition towards mature adults rather than genuine sexual attraction to children?  Food for thought.",1147996800,15,1196,4.900990099009901
