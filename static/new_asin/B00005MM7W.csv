1627796,4,B00005MM7W,"wow... what can i say. this old school kung fu flick is corny, over the top, ridiculous, and totally sweet. it's clearly not an A grade film, but it doesn't try to be and doesn't pretend it is. the plot is fairly standard, with a student trying to avenge the death of his master. he does this in pretty weird ways (disguising himself as a begger for some reason), but it leads to some great kung fu fights. one of my favorite parts about this movie is that characters just fight instead of trying to talk or explain themselves at all. awesome.
it's pretty hard to tell exactly who the invincible obsessed fighter is in this film, but that's ok. the kung fu action is pretty good despite awful direction, the characters and dialogue are hilarious even though they don't make any sense, and it's just a fun movie to watch.
the only problems i really had were with the DVD release itself. through experience i've found that these xenon releases of classic kung fu flicks are very, very low quality. the only audio option is horrible english dubbing (don't you hate that?), the video transfer and image quality is very poor, and the left and right edges of the frame are cut off (there's one point in the film where two characters, one holding a sword, run to opposite ends of the frame, dissappear off screen due to the poorly cropped frame, and the sword flies from off screen, across the frame, and off the opposite end of the frame again with no characters on screen at all ha ha).
still, this movie is worth picking up if you're into cheesy old school kung fu. if you want a better all round movie (and DVD) in the same veign, get master of the flying guillotine.",1085356800,4,1664,4.4411764705882355

7945950,3,B00005MM7W,"So your thinking about buying Invincible Obsessed Fighter huh, not sure if its good,

has great martial art scenes or even a plot? Well look here let me break it all down.

1) This movie is NOT a highly complex film where warriors clash and all hell breaks

loose and there is resistance between super styles.

2) This movie is not about someone being defeated and practicing through all these

dificult levels to defeat his or the ""enemy""

3) This is not some Wu Tang or Shaolin Temple film, or a swordplay film. Its more like

a Eclectic Kung Fu film, with people trying to kill the hero (Elton Chong) but cant.

He's just to Resourcefull and outwits everyone. In order to keep the people around him

safe, he chooses to life a life of disguise and secrecy. There is the element of Humor

in the film but mostly it's a vengance type film.

This includes a Ghost Fighter, the old man on the cover, and among other people a

Kung Fu expert.

4) This movie is not HORRIBLE in fact i might suprise you by saying its good, but it's So

Ridiculously Horribly Good if that makes any sense.

Its not something that was done on purpose because the Editing is just plain terrible ...

But its just it ended up having so much humor to it. This is the StereoTypical old school

Kung Fu movie with a twist of mysticism humor and on skilled resourcefull kung fu fighter.

The way two people are talking and then from NOWHERE a kick slides down someones

face, i mean god. Not only that the Chinese to English translation is so Horrrible...

That believe it or not the Film gets good! Weird Huh?

5) There is no love story besides a small one, in fact hm let me see... at one point the

main character is dressed up in one of his many disguises as a woman and the love interest

seeking to escape her former life and the way things are is dressed up as a man.

This is the type of film this was. The characters style is Light hearted the guy is

pretty cool he goes on Taunting every opponent he goes against DURING the fights.

Exclaiming ""Hey im done fooling with you"" after he kicks one guy and his entire body

summersaults, ""You better not mess around... Unless you want some more.""

It's up to you and what you are in the mood for or open to the movie is funny as hell has

lots of action and can lend no more genuis than some middle grade fight scenes at its peak.

No extras whatsoever, Fullscreen. Sounds pretty bad but most of these re-releases of kung

fu movies hardly ever come with extras anyway. I definetely would call the quality of this

movie Re-mastered but im sure it better than any VHS version you could find of the film,

probably -  the best copy of this film you can buy if you want it.

I reccomend this film but its definitely not for ""hardcore"" plot and super fight scenes

kind of Fu Fans, lol, um its definitly a B movie. I like it one of a kind movie.",1127606400,2,2870,4.25
