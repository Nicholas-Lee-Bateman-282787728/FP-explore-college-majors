7829206,4,6302620724,Love the sex scenes and wished it were ME ;-PPP But it was a creepy movie.  The end of the movie I thought was pretty funny...,1462665600,,126,3.8461538461538463
7829207,1,6302620724,"The plot was okay, the acting was very good by some (Reeve and Helgenberger were superb) and HORRIBLE by others .  The doctor played by Flanagan with her Transylvania/Dracula/gypsy fortuneteller accent was so painful, so pathetic, so contrived that  I could not stand it and I have a high threshold for bad acting.

Some of the scenes in the movie were so obviously made up to give the movie it's ""splash"" clips they could use to advertise the movie and were so poorly done, so out of context that they are laughable.

Christopher Reeve does a great job with his role and he carries the movie but even Superman couldn't save this stinker.",1426723200,,638,4.619469026548672

7829209,5,6302620724,I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  YOU REALLY FEEL THE ANGER AND RESENTMENT CHRISTOPHER REEVE'S CHARACTER HAS AGAINST HIS STEP DAUGHTER.  I THOUGHT BOTH HE AND HELGENBERG PLAYED THE PARTS SO WELL. THE SORROW THE MOTHER FEELS FOR HER DEAD DAUGHTER IS FELT SO GUTRENCHING. THE END IS WONDERFULLY DONE ALSO. IT PROVES THAT A BOND BETWEEN MOTHER AND CHILD IS NEVER BROKEN EVEN IN DEATH.  I GIVE IT ALL FIVE STARS.,1196035200,2,394,4.6
7829210,2,6302620724,"As a fan of Christopher Reeve I watched this entire overwrought drama, but felt the plot was flawed from the start.  This was about a foolish mother who stood by while her beloved child set out rowing an air-filled floatcraft alone, without a life jacket, knowing that the kid couldn't swim.  How utterly stupid of her, yet we're supposed to believe her brilliant husband was madly enough in love with her to go beyond the limits of decency. It's a gripping story, tho, and beautifully filmed.",1126828800,,493,4.72093023255814
7829211,4,6302620724,if you like supernatural and paranormal movies ? See this one its a great movie  a muddered girl is coming back from her grave to haunt for revenge  and for the truth,941328000,2,166,4.15625
