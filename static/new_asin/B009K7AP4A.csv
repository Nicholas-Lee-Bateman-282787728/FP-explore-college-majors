5344181,4,B009K7AP4A,"Phil Vischer has produced two videos based on the series he produced called Buck Denver Asks Whats in the Bible? This video series contains six to seven vignettes where unknown childrens questions get answered. Each vignette follows the same template. The first scene is Buck Denver in the newsroom introducing a question he is investigating. For example, in the first vignette, he is asking questions about the kangaroo. Before he can get to a report, he is interrupted by an unnamed newsroom worker who tells him to take the call which is flashing on the monitor behind him.
Then after finding out what the question is, the scene quickly changed to Clive and Ians Wonder-Blimp of Knowledge. Clive and Ian sing an intro song and ask the monkey who is driving the blimp to take them to a location to answer the question. After a moment they arrive but it is not a physical location but a place where they receive the signal from someone who can answer the question.
Now this is where the kids question can be answered.

The first DVD answers 6 questions, Emily asks Who made the Universe?, Diego asks Is God as powerful as a superhero?, Latasha  asks, How old is God?, Alexander asks, Does God love me even when I make bad choices?, Jessica asks, Is God with me when I am afraid?, and Megan asks, Can I count on God?. All the answers are very theologically accurate with one reservation.

I was particularly interested in the answer to the first question because it included statements about origins. Each question is answered by an expert and in this case it is a character named Dr. Shniffenhowzen. He starts by talking about all the energy in the universe and then says science tells us that energy cannot be created but can only be changed from one form to another. So the answer is beyond science. I found this answer well done and quite a clever one.
The question he says science cannot answer is how did life begin?
Ian responds that Darwin would say they evolved and the Dr. clarifies by saying that Darwins theory only talks about how creatures change a little bit over time. It doesnt say anything about how living creatures came about in the first place. Darwins theory didn't say about where life came from.
So the universe and life came from God because the Bible tells us so.

I find this clarification initially very comforting but then I realized the video never refutes Darwins theory of change. He leaves the idea of microevolution as a valid theory which fits in with his portrayal of the creation story in the other video Buck Denver Asks Whats in the Bible?.

So with this caution in mind, I would recommend this video series as a valid way to help children learn biblical answers to their probing questions.",1440115200,11,2729,4.630165289256198
