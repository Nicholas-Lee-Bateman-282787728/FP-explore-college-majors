There is just something about this movie that appeals to me, can't really explain it. Seen it at least 6 times already, wouldn't mind seeing it again.",1358726400,,268,4.38

As one of our greatest, underrated actors, anything he does is well worth watching (even in the smallest roles.) This was actually a fun movie; I was pleasantly surprised.",1336435200,,252,4.478260869565218
