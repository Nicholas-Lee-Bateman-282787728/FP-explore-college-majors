However the editing is very choppy; it cuts abruptly from song to song, losing intros and a few last notes. Also, there were only two Yes songs, and four Moodies songs. I know the Moodies played at least one more song on that show, and I thought Yes did, too.",1401408000,2,379,4.0

If you are a fan of either band or both the price is really too inexpensive not to add this DVD to your collection.....",1373846400,2,210,4.146341463414634
8498520,2,B006HH60B8,"Recorded in 1998, this is one of the poorest videos I have viewed in the last 20 years.  I have VHS tapes with better image and sound quality.  The audio is terrible - many glitches and sudden shifts from one song to another.  There is no introduction and no break or interlude between the two bands. Through the entire video a HUGE ""LIVE"" banner displays on the screen. Save your money, or spend it on ""Live at Red Rocks"" or ""Live from Albert Hall.""  The six songs (2 Yes and 4 Moodies)were at best an amateur production and a professional rip-off.",1330819200,35,549,4.405940594059406
