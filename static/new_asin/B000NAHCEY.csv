8176354,1,B000NAHCEY,I have scoliosis & found this dvd to be useless.,1472688000,,48,3.9
8176355,2,B000NAHCEY,"I suppose this video could be useful to people with more severe scoliosis and/or old age. But the workouts are too easy for a half-way fit person. And since scoliosis varies so much from patient to patient, it'd be much better to visit a good physical therapist a couple times.",1350777600,2,277,4.56
8176356,1,B000NAHCEY,"First of all, I had scoliosis surgery in June 2010 and it went well.  I have no pain!!  I was looking for a pilates type DVD to help with stretches and core strengthening.  When I checked out this DVD, it failed to mention that I would need to buy WALL SPRINGS!!  Who wants to buy more stuff when I just bought the stupid DVD for $20!  I never even opened this, just read the cover and now not interested.  I checked on returning this and it says FINAL SALE.  Nice of them to leave this off when you place the order.  Seriously, do you think someone with scoliosis feels like hanging from their door frame on wall springs??  Get real!  The DVD also says they recommend series two.  I bet they do, so they can get another $20 off me??  I think not!  If you are still interested after reading this, email me & I will sell you this one.",1296604800,9,833,4.13125
8176357,5,B000NAHCEY,"I am a certified pilates trainer and have 3 clients with scoliosis.  It's true that the exercise portion of the video is short but the information gained throughout the entire video is worth it. Even if you can find the same info in books, to visually learn is always better.  You can never stop learning; knowledge is key to being a good trainer.",1282003200,14,347,4.492063492063492
8176358,2,B000NAHCEY,"If you are looking for an exercise video this is not for you.  The workout section is extremely short, and hard to get to.  I also didn't see how it was helpful to scoliosis.  Its a pretty standard Pilates routine. Also, you need to buy fairly pricey equipment in order to even do the workout.  The equipment is not sold on Amazon, and is difficult to find. Don't be fooled if you are told you don't need the equipment, you definitely do. Most of the DVD contains information your could read about in a book.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1249689600,26,545,4.303921568627451
8176359,5,B000NAHCEY,"This DVD does not give itself enough credit for the amount of information that Suzanne gives on the subject of scoliosis. After several visits to a chiropractor who shrugged off my curved spine shown on an ex-ray, and several traditional therapies, I found a physical therapist who would incorporate exercise based on Suzanne's classical pilates techniques. I also purchased her Core volume II and will use both as I work with my physical therapist trained in Pilates (who was hard to find!). After 1 day, I feel my hip is back where is should be and more flexibilty. I did not have the wall springs, but I could mimick the positions and movements as a basic mat routine. I will also shop around for the wall springs. I will purchase Volume II.",1232841600,24,744,4.643939393939394
