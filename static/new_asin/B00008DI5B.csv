The Medusa Touch is an British film that was limited in its release in the US. Its about a man(Rchard Burton) who is a writer disillusioned with the world. He is also a very powerful telekinetic who makes disaster happen just by thinking about them. Lee Remic(spelling) plays his psych. anaylist. Someone realizes what he is doing and tries to kill him but he survives and is in a coma where he is free to unleash his deadly power. GREAT MOVIE MUST SEE!!!!!",1391472000,,576,4.495238095238095
