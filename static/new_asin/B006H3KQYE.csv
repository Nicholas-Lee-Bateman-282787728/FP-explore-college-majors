Bad acting. Worse soundtrack.

The story is nothing special and is simply about a gang of thieves breaking into a rich casino vault, and the films title just refers to a baby that's kidnapped later on in the film. It's low-budget with a budget that doesn't allow for anything elaborate. The action sequences will probably be considered bland and uninspired by many, and the movie will have a limited appeal. The film begins with some nice scenery on a beach. There's full nudity within the first couple of minutes from Sasa Kastoura; unfortunately, she died in 2014 according to the IMDB. I thought she looked pretty good, so it's off to a good start. Later in the film, there's a couple more shots of full nudity; however, these below the waist shots aren't long and are quick. Some other shots of topless and rear nudity are also present later on. The main problem with the film is a gap that I personally thought dragged and therefore damaged the film. About the first half hour moves well. It takes over 15 minutes for the first death, but things move along pretty well with that nudity in the beginning and the thieves breaking into the casino vault; but then after about the first 30 minutes, I thought it had a gap of over 20 minutes that was kind of boring at times. Over 50 minutes into the movie, the pace starts to pick up again. There's a close-up shot of a stabbing, which is actually the bloodiest scene in the film, and a guy is crushed over an hour into the flick with only a little blood spilling from his mouth. There's no extreme gore in the film, and none of the gunshot deaths are really bloody. The overall blood content in the film is very low. I didn't have a problem with the acting, and the directing will probably be considered OK or below average depending on your taste. The film also has a rather unsatisfactory ending with just a shootout sequence near the sea that doesn't display any good exploitation. With the exception of the sequences near the sea, the rest of the films scenery is nothing worth mentioning. As for the atmosphere, I thought it fails and delivers nothing effective. Another problem is that it isn't a well scored film; better soundtracks would've helped it. I'll give the flick about three and a half stars because I liked some stuff about it; I thought it has a pretty good retro feel and style, but I think many will lose interest and be bored by it.

This is mastered from either one or a variety of VHS sources and is in rough shape. The picture isn't really clear because it has lots of stuff like assorted marks, tape dropouts, and color bleeding. The quality varies with some places looking better and worse than others, but I've seen other DVDs that are mastered from VHS sources that look much worse. The main problem with the picture is that it looks messy in many places. At least it isn't really dark like some other VHS transfers that I've seen, so you can see what's going on. Since they used old and worn VHS materials, the sharpness, contrast and color could've been worse; for a VHS transfer, I personally didn't think that these things looked bad. However, many people may be disappointed in the somewhat degraded and messy type quality. It has a photo gallery that lasts under 1 minute.",1421366400,,3366,4.554455445544554
