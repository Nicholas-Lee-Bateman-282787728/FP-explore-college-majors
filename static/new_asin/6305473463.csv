7890519,2,6305473463,"Apparently, ""Virtual Combat"" is the first solo vehicle that Don Wilson completed after his supporting role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Forever/dp/B001OST0LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Forever</a>, and it doesn't seem like The Dragon learned anything from Hollywood. ""Virtual Combat"" (more aptly known as ""Grid Runners"") is bad in the worst way: it's a major missed opportunity. Though I have learned over time not to expect much from Wilson's flicks, this one is particularly disappointing not only for the unique storyline it squanders, but also for the selection of supporting talent that gets wasted in the process.

The story: when a scientific breakthrough makes it possible for virtual reality characters to be ""cloned"" into human form, the deadliest combatant of a fighting game (Michael Bernardo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter/dp/B00005UWOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter</a>) wreaks havoc in his mission to bring his fellow fighters to reality, and the only one who can stop him is a ""grid runner"" security specialist (Wilson).

There's enough buffoonery going on here to take note of even without considering the deficiencies of the action content, mainly in the form of the story content. For example, when it's revealed that life can now basically be created from nothing, the biggest plan the evil CEO (Ron Barker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braddock-Missing-In-Action-III/dp/B004CJQVO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braddock: Missing In Action III</a>) can come up with for his new miracle is to clone his virtual reality women and enter the prostitution business. Later, the lead villain is inexplicably impervious to lasers, can form objects like swords out of his body, and makes trashcans burst into flames with a gesture. Oh, and Don Wilson's character can blow up a helicopter with a revolver. It's enjoyable cheese for the most part, but taxes the credibility of an already fantastical plot.

But I can swallow just about any nonsense in a martial arts movie, provided there are plenty of good fights to back it up. This film has it half right: there is no shortage of fights, but none of them are good. None. Having seen almost all of Wilson's pictures, I'm used to this, but for the cast involved, this one is particularly disheartening. While Don often stuffs his pictures with legitimate martial artists, few of them have an onscreen track record, unlike a good deal of the fighting cast here. Wilson's onscreen partner Ken McLeod (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/College-Kickboxers/dp/B00IKMEQDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">College Kickboxers</a>) and minor thug Nicholas Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>) were good guys of the B-movie kickboxing scene. Michael Bernardo himself is probably the most complete performer of this era who never got a substantial solo career. And supporting villain Loren Avedon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender-2/dp/B0002ISFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender 2</a>) is simply one of the most talented karate stars of the last three decades. So why have the fights been swamped with tight camera angles, chopping editing, and slow motion? - only the producers know for sure, but the brawls are definitely ruined because of it.

People who go for Don Wilson's style of fight scene will probably really enjoy this ample offering, but personally, I was counting the minutes until the film was over and I could write this review. I have no doubt that Don worked very hard for each of his movies, but the way they've turned out just don't endear him to me as a martial arts star. For the fans, only.",1405296000,,3958,6.217153284671533
