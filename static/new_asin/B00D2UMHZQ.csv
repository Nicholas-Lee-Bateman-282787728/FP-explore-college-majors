5768641,4,B00D2UMHZQ,"I got this DVD for my young nephews, and they love it! I even find myself singing the songs throughout the day. It's fun and gets the kids moving! I especially like that the movements can be done without tons of space required.",1394582400,,227,4.3023255813953485
5768732,1,B00D2UMHZQ,"Received Fit Pea DVD, brand new, and the first time we put in, it freezes several times. We really couldn't even watch it. Do not buy this for older children it's ment for children between 1-3 in my opinion.",1418169600,,207,4.333333333333333
5768733,5,B00D2UMHZQ,I bought this for my preschoolers who range from 2-5yrs old. They all love it. I wish there were more like this one.,1417651200,,116,4.086956521739131
5768734,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"I bought this for my nephew (1) and son (5) and they LOVE it!!!!  It keeps all ages engaged and active.  I love watching my son do the exercise moves and watching the instructors and their enthusiasm is contagious.  I found myself doing the exercises too...and felt like I got a work out :-)  What a wonderful idea, starting kids early in life loving being physically active.  Def money well spent and I will be buying more as my friends/family have babies!",1404259200,2,457,4.524390243902439
5768735,5,B00D2UMHZQ,This is definitely a wonderful DVD for young children. Just enough time to keep the interest and enthusiasm of a child with catchy animation and musical song that will keep you humming for hours! Great time to interact with grandchild!  So much fun and getting little ones to want to exercise like the adults do makes this an extra special DVD. Don't just put in a DVD to entertain - entertain for health and fun. Highly recommend!,1401667200,,431,4.597402597402597
5768736,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"Great kids fitness video. Catchy songs, and I am pleased with the purchase. I would recommend this to all my friends with little ones.",1397952000,,134,4.625
5768737,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"This was such a cute video!  Perfect for those cold or rainy days when your kids need to expend some energy!  Catchy songs, easy basic moves and lively characters make it a go-to in my household. My 3 and 7 year old both beg to put Fit Pea in!!",1397347200,2,244,3.9591836734693877
5768738,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"I sent this to my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter, and then had a chance to watch her enjoy it. Each segment is just the right length for a small child's attention span, and the music is simple and peppy. This is a great idea, and well carried out.",1396915200,2,245,4.125
5768739,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"My three year old and six year old love this workout! I even gave a copy to my son's Kindergarten teacher who has been using it to give the kids an exercise break in the classroom. The kids love it! The short length is perfect for the attention span of young kids, and they never seem to get bored of it. I even enjoying watching it :). My kids also love coloring the Fit Pea coloring sheet after working out, which can be downloaded from the Fit Pea facebook page. Having ""Fit Pea Parties"" has become a fun daily routine in our home. I highly recommend it!",1396051200,4,557,4.214953271028038
5768740,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"We have a toddler who only has a few ""select"" videos he wants to watch. Fit Pea has joined Stuart Little and Little Orphan Annie in his group of must watch movies. The video is short at around 10 minutes long, but for little ones that seems to be an ideal amount of time to keep their short attention span, and for those who are looking to ""work out"" the kids it is the perfect amount of time.  It's also fun to hear our 2 year old mispronounce the title, the funniest version so far has been ""Cat Pee.""

I'd highly recommend this video for anyone with pre-K kids.",1395273600,2,564,4.165137614678899
5768741,5,B00D2UMHZQ,The kids love it and they don't even think about the fact that they are getting exercise. My son loves it and it is funny to watch him dance around.,1394582400,2,148,3.966666666666667
8588730,5,B00D2UMHZQ,Love these shorter workouts to fit into my busy day.,1510444800,,52,4.3
8588731,1,B00D2UMHZQ,"This looks like it might be a terrific workout dvd.  But I ordered one that skipped impossibly, then returned it and bought another.  The same thing happened again!  I don't understand how two copies could have been defective, and I know it isn't my dvd player which I use daily to workout.  So, I'm super frustrated, as I think I would have really enjoyed this workout.  If anyone has information to share about this dvd skipping like crazy, please let me know!",1491436800,,462,4.585365853658536
8588732,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"Extremely challenging. Not for a raw beginner unless you view it a few times first and go slow to start! Many different routines to choose from so it doesn't get boring.  Great for upper body strength, core, and back which are all weak on me.  I recommend this DVD highly!",1482796800,,272,4.42
8588733,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"I have an in-home daycare with a range of ages.  The older kids (1st grade & up) love having ""dance time"" and my younger group (1-4 years) LOVE this DVD that we do it everyday and twice in a row!  It is super simple for the littles to understand and to keep up.  The older kids love the beat of the music and they get exercise without even realizing it because the videos are short and keep there interest!!!  I wish that there was another video because I'd buy it in a heartbeat!!!  Thank you moms for making a great workout DVD!!!!",1480550400,,533,4.186274509803922
8588734,1,B00D2UMHZQ,my kids hated it,1450569600,,16,3.25
8588735,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"This is such a refreshing break from the other DVDs we have. I only wish it was longer! This is a great tool for someone that needs 5-10 minutes to make a phone call, encourage a quick change of mood in their child, or for teachers who need an active transition between activities in the classroom, rainy day or not.
I hope Fit Pea 2 will be at least twice as long! PLEASE!!",1444089600,,374,4.136986301369863
8588736,1,B00D2UMHZQ,"Really? The idea is cute but it's only 11 minutes long, and only about 5 minutes of that is exercise. Each section is about 30 seconds long. Not worth the money, we had to do it twice to even feel like we did anything. My kids are 2.5 and 6 and it was disappointing to them as well.",1440460800,2,282,3.8793103448275863
8588737,3,B00D2UMHZQ,"This is to short.....  Its not even 10 mins.  Pretty disappointing really, especially for $12.99 .",1438214400,,98,5.0625
8588738,4,B00D2UMHZQ,"Love the idea!!! I bought this for my almost-two-year old and I to use together, The songs and videos are great for little kids. The only problem we have is that it moves quite quickly from one to the next when using the ""Play All"" feature. My son has trouble getting the moves down before the song ends and it moves on to the next one. Older kids would be able to pick up the moves much faster. I would love for them to make another video for the younger kids that would spend a little more time on the moves before going into the song. But after a few more views he should have it memorized and can move along with them. The scenes, enthusiasm and outfits make this an entertaining 'workout'.",1422576000,,694,4.225563909774436
8588739,5,B00D2UMHZQ,"This was a gift for my grandson. He loves it. My daughter said, although it says it's 10 minutes, it's more like 8-9.",1418774400,2,117,4.130434782608695
