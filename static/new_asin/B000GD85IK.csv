2604775,5,B000GD85IK,"This is a great video for beginners who don't know anyone personally to teach them how to knit. I had been trying to learn to knit for a month now and finally know how to do a knit stitch thanks to this video!

If you know someone you can help you knit, get their help first but this video is great for people who don't have that help. I would suggest learning how to knit from a video than buying a book.",1202774400,14,405,3.9390243902439024
2604776,5,B000GD85IK,"I thought this was good. I got it for my grandkids to learn to knit and I think it is just the video to do that!!  I recommend it!!  It's very clear and easy to follow for adults and children.  I will probably purchase the rest of the series.  OH...by the way, I do not work for Leisure Arts...this is an honest review.  Thank you!",1190505600,14,331,4.030769230769231
2604777,5,B000GD85IK,"The knitting instructional DVD is clear and organized well. Miss Leapman brings her knowledge as a teacher to the privacy of your own home. If you need to review a stitch, the DVD's format design allows you to view the demonstration without having to return to the beginning of the DVD. ""Two needles up"" to Leisure Arts.",1183420800,13,320,4.631578947368421
2604778,5,B000GD85IK,"I had little to no knowledge about knitting and this was a great product.  Very easy to follow, very easy to use.  Helped me, and taught me a lot of things I definitely needed to know.",1389830400,,184,4.083333333333333
2604779,5,B000GD85IK,it is in motion i can stop the video as like and review as i will at one time I was going to the library but i would have to bring it back in so many days now I have my own and it is nice.,1388102400,,188,3.108695652173913
2604780,5,B000GD85IK,"I know some may not like the time she takes to show every step. I seem to forget how to knit every summer and enjoy the extra instruction the ""knit-alongs"" provide.",1387065600,3,164,4.32258064516129
2604781,5,B000GD85IK,Learning how to knit by dvd is awesome. Would highly recommend for someone just starting out.  Give it a 5 Star rating,1374278400,,118,4.363636363636363
2604782,5,B000GD85IK,This series of videos is a great tool for those who want to learn knitting.  It is great for the beginner or the more experienced who may not have knitted for a while and need a reminder of how to do things.,1363737600,,207,3.9285714285714284
2604783,2,B000GD85IK,The contents seem okay but I also ordered another DVD from the used section or reseller and that one was still shrink wrapped which I thought was pretty good.,1363046400,,158,4.482758620689655
2604784,5,B000GD85IK,"I tell you this is one of the best things I've seen since I was a child, now all I have to do is sit and watch instead of trying to second guess myself, I have a really bad memory so between my husband and my children this is what they turn to when they see me getting frustrated because I have forgotten how to do something... This is one amazing tool...",1339286400,,355,3.9444444444444446
2604785,5,B000GD85IK,"This is an excellent dvd for beginning knitters. I think that the instructor is a wonderful teacher. She definitely helped me feel more comfortable with the mechanics behind knitting. I bought another dvd earlier,which I did not like,but this one helped encourage me to  want to continue with knitting. I hope that the instructor creates many many many more dvds on knitting. I would love it if in the future, she would create different dvds on how to do all sorts of knitting patterns. I learn better through dvds, than than through books teaching knitting patterns.",1274313600,3,567,4.90625
2604786,5,B000GD85IK,"This is really a well done DVD. You absolutely will learn to knit! I did! AND I love it! I actually got this from the library first, but liked it so much I bought it! Don't be turned off by the front photo.....She's not the instructor. The instructor has a nice calmness about her....not flashy, but confident and pleasant. A bargain!!!",1269475200,3,336,4.524590163934426
2604787,2,B000GD85IK,"First, I would not call the host an expert knitter. Her continental style is very sloppy. the complete beginner's guide was MUCH better. this is for the complete novice. I picked this up to learn cont. style and long tail cast on. She goes WAY to fast in the long tail cast one. Other times are very slow. She even pauses to count her stitches in an example....what a waste of time. a novice would do much better to watch a youtube clip. there is no real value to this dvd. unlike complete beginner DVD which you can keep going back to, to learn more. not sure why the other reviews are so high. Just wanted to let folks know the truth.",1262563200,10,636,4.221311475409836
8130628,2,B000GD85IK,"I thought it would be more beginner prone.  Confusing to me.  Also, when I returned it I only got back $2 and change from the $13.99 I paid.  Didn't like that.",1498435200,,159,4.064516129032258
8130629,5,B000GD85IK,Purchased as a gift.  She was happy.,1490400000,,36,4.142857142857143
8130630,5,B000GD85IK,Allows one to watch portions over and over again.,1486339200,,49,4.555555555555555
8130631,5,B000GD85IK,IT MADE A GREAT GIFT,1485734400,,20,3.2
8130632,4,B000GD85IK,"If you don't have a knitter always available, this is great.",1475193600,,60,4.545454545454546
8130633,5,B000GD85IK,It was sent in to the prison for the guys there to learn to knit.  I am sure they will love it,1472169600,,94,3.272727272727273
8130634,1,B000GD85IK,Really wasn't helpful. I would not recommend it.,1447372800,,48,5.125
8130635,4,B000GD85IK,Visual Helpful for beginner knitters.,1429833600,,37,6.6
8130636,2,B000GD85IK,Somewhat disappointing. Got more information via internet. not as good or informative as I originally expected it to be.,1423440000,,120,5.368421052631579
8130637,2,B000GD85IK,"The audio is recorded at such a low volume that I can barely understand what is being said.  I have a new computer equipped with great sound, all settings full out and I still can't understand her very well.  I don't seem to be able to turn on the closed captioning which defaults to off and appears to have no on option, which would probably augment the sound well enough for me to use this DVD.  I really don't think it is my settings because every other DVD I have tried has superior sound quality through this computer and needs the volume adjusted lower.  I would love any advice anyone can offer....thanks!",1407628800,,612,4.4375
