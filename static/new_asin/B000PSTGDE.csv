2828021,5,B000PSTGDE,I believe all young people should watch this movie and have time to think about their lives to shape themselves.,1370563200,,112,4.65
2828022,5,B000PSTGDE,I was amazed at the depth and feeling of this movie on forgiveness of this story.  The fact that it is a true story is amazing what Bruce did.  I wonder if anyone else would have done such a thing.  I would like to think they might but it would take a very big man (on the inside) to carry it out.  Dean Cain did a fantastic performance and should have won an award for it.,1361232000,,373,3.8684210526315788
2828023,5,B000PSTGDE,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE ALOT. IT HAS ALOT TO TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT FORGIVING OTHERS EVEN WHEN THEY TAKE AWAY YOUR REASON(S) FOR LIVING. IT IS WHAT I WANTED.,1325808000,,157,4.448275862068965
2828024,5,B000PSTGDE,"This movie was an excellent story of how strongly forgiveness can heal. It helps to remind us that we need to listen to all around us, even in the tough times and it reminds us that we all make mistakes. How we deal with the mistakes we make and the mistakes of others will make a difference in all lives touched.

Based on a true story, this movie will take the watcher through a range of emotions. Superbly protrayed and it is also nice to know how the family and others have fared since the tragic incidents that led to this portrayal. A must for all to see.",1249516800,2,561,4.194444444444445
2828025,5,B000PSTGDE,"I've seen this movie twice on TV, plus I own a copy of it. It is very well made.

Dean Cain does a great job of portraying Bruce Murakami, and bringing into our living rooms the emotional nightmare that this grieving husband and father was forced to experience. I also felt compassion for the young man who caused the accident, largely because the actor who played him expressed real emotions as he acted the part. The movie is very well directed, and even gives attention to the emotional distance between Bruce and his youngest son.

This movie is not overdramatized. It is very ""true to life,"" as it is a presentation of a true story. Furthermore, it gives a sort of documentary background to the formation of Safe Teen Driver, the organization that Bruce founded to educate teens so that they don't make the same mistake that killed his wife and daughter.[...]

Whether or not you have teenagers, this movie is worth buying. If fact, it is a great tool for teaching lessons about forgiveness, no matter what age.",1246406400,3,1016,4.664804469273743
2828026,5,B000PSTGDE,Very moving true-life story without descending into melodrama and hystrionics. Dean Cain shows once again that his talent was wasted in Lois & Clark.,1241827200,2,149,5.25
2828027,5,B000PSTGDE,Great story for those who like to plot revenge on anybody who crosses against them,1241481600,,82,4.533333333333333
2828028,5,B000PSTGDE,This DVD was very inspiring and brought a desire to forgive the seemingly unforgivable.  To be like Jesus!,1238457600,7,106,4.888888888888889
2828029,5,B000PSTGDE,I found this to be a very moving film that I think many people (especially teens) should see as it might just make them think twice about speeding and dangerous driving. Its also quite inspirational as what the main character (and real father) did seems impossible to most of us but he managed to do it. Makes you wonder about the silly grudges we all have. Also thought Dean Cain was brillliant. I'm a huge fan of his anyway but thought this was one of his best performances.,1203465600,18,476,4.420454545454546
2828030,5,B000PSTGDE,"I only wish we all could be as forgiving as this Father was and truly is in this movie. Based on a true story this Dad looses two precious gifts in his life; his beautiful wife and precious daughter. He start outs in a rage wanting to prove that the teenager that was ""racing"" when he killed them.  The Dad was wanting to him put away in jail forever, but something happened and changed his heart forever. An incredible and heartwarming story about one family that will warm your heart, also.",1183680000,19,492,4.406593406593407

8193192,5,B000PSTGDE,Outstanding true story with progressive responses of grieving characters from anger through to forgiveness and reconciliation.

8193194,5,B000PSTGDE,"I wasn't really sure what this was about, but felt like I couldn't be disappointed with a Hallmark choice -
and I wasn't! The relationship and coming of age issues are dealt with straight up, The acting is well
done, and the plot arc very hopeful. Even the worst events (so it would seem) can have a silver lining.",1400371200,,314,4.338983050847458
8193195,5,B000PSTGDE,This is a wonderful heartwarming FAMILY movie. It shows the love & loneliness that a family experiences during the good times and bad times that a family goes through. This is a movie that should be exposed to more schools and families. There is a strong lesson being presented in this movie. It's filled with scenes that will make you cry and/or fill your heart with a sense of love. This is something you won't forget quickly.,1398124800,,428,4.571428571428571
