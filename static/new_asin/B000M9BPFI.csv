2727744,4,B000M9BPFI,"Any ""true fan"" of this series should at least like this movie! I saw the original at the theater back in the day, and have loved it ever since. I participated in the dvd campaign to bring the original to DVD. Rave to the Grave is almost as fun as any in the series(way better than necropolis). I wish that any one who dislikes this movie and gives it a bad rap on here, or anywhere else, would step up to the plate and make something better!!! My two cents worth!!!",1182124800,5,465,4.1208791208791204
2727745,5,B000M9BPFI,"This one is different than part four and I must say I liked it better. In this one they take the trioxon and use it as a drug not knowing what it will do to people. Of course the people that took the drug end up turning into zombies and that is when the fun begins. Also in this film we have the classic tar man zombie that we all know and love, that I thought was really cool. I still don't understand why people don't like part four and five. But to each their own I guess. But in my opinion if you like the first four return of the living dead films you should like this one. This one has the comedy just like the first two and like part four. In this one you have the two government agents that are funny as hell. As far as the zombies they are like the zombies in part four. Also there is plenty of zombie carnage and gore to please us sick individuals. But all in all this is your standard zombie film with zombies going around killing people. So if you like zombie movies you will like this.",1175817600,7,998,3.995

They need to let this franchise die or find Russo & let him save it...But, it's probably too late - the cancer that is parts 4 & 5 has spread...This makes part 3 look like high art...

I love zombie films more than any kind of horror..I own more than most people know exist...I don't say this to soud like a know it all but this movie is just embarrasing...

2727748,1,B000M9BPFI,"There's not much to say about Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave other than it's actually worse than the movie before it. Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis was really bad and not in the so bad it's funny. What had been a cult horror franchise which had fun with the zombie genre in addition to putting some genuine scares in people, these last two Return of the Living Dead movies should pretty much kill the franchise just when the zombie revival is still going on strong.

Ellory Elkayem does directing duty for this fifth installment. He also directed the fourth film. I had thought that not everything should be laid at Elkayem's feet when it came to who to blame for the lackluster and awful film that was Necropolis, but after sitting through Rave to the Grave I have to say that whatever good will Ellory Elkayem built up with his funny take on the giant creature feature, Eight-Legged Freaks, has been wasted with his back-to-back filming of Return of the Living Dead 4 and 5. Elkayem films both films one after the other and I am going to assume this was more to save on the budget than any sort of continuity with the actors hired to play recurring roles. If saving money was the main reason then it sure didn't look like it. Except for a few hero-zombie (zombies given more screentime than most thus given a better make-up effect) scenes the film clearly shows it's ultra low-budget pedrigree. I don't have problems with low-budget horror movies as long as there's a sense of energy and enjoyment by those making it, but neither Necropolis and Rave to the Grave showed any one of the two.

Rave to the Grave occurs one year after the events of Necropolis and the teenage survivors of that film have now graduated and attending college. The film never really makes it clear if they're in back in the U.S. attending college or still in Eastern Europe where the previous film was set. Either way the survivors from the previous film seem to have moved on quite well from their horrific experiences in Necropolis. The fact that they don't seem to recognize the newly found containment barrel marked with the label of 2-4-5 Trioxin just adds to the weird and hge plot hole between film four and five. One would think that these kids would have it etched forver in their minds that containment barrel with 2-4-5- Trioxin equals horror. Instead they naively investigate and research the barrel with one of their friends realizing he could turn the chemical leaking from the barrel into a new form of rave drug whose extreme hallucinogenic effects also hide a side-effect which basically turns anyone who partakes of the drug into a zombie.

The rest of the movie deals with the survivors finally realizing the crisis they've unleashed and instead of calling for police or military help decide to go to the same outdoor rave party where everyone is taking the drug to try and find the person who made the drug Z and stop him from taking them. Like I said earlier the movie really has major plot holes and most of the time doesn't make much sense. What we get in the end is an excuse to have a huge set piece where the survivors get to shoot as many zombies as possible while at the same time allow for the random raver to suddenly become a zombie out of the blue. There's also a subplot of a couple of bumbling Men-in-Black type agents whose job it is to recover the Trioxin barrel while remaining inconspicuous. The secret organization they belong to must be global since I could barely understand their lines with the heavy Russian accent used by both ""actors"".

My disappointment in what could've been a nice follow-up to the first three Return of the Living Dead movies was compounded by the sheer Z-movie level of Rave to the Grave after the awful work that was Necropolis. For those wanting to see a good b-level zombie movie that's bad but enjoyable at the same time should check out House of the Dead 2. Yes, the sequel to Uwe Boll's rancid and awful House of the Dead ended up being better than the original and way more entertaining than Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave. I wouldn't even accept this film as a free dvd if someone gave it to me.",1174348800,16,4189,4.5297225891677675
2727749,1,B000M9BPFI,"Does Peter Coyote desperately need money?  Made side by side with Return of the Living 4: Necropolis for the Sci-Fi Channel, Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave makes the aforementioned film look like Casablanca.  The surviving teens from the last film are here again, now in college, and apparently they have no memory of the events that took place bcause they look shocked when they first see the undead, and make some just plain dumb decisions in the process.  Whatever the reason behind the direction of the story, said story revolves around another cannister found, and a few kids making a rave drug out of it called, you guessed it, Z.  There's some funny moments here and there, but everything about the film is so bad (from the acting, the story, and the makeup effects) that you'll be in hysterics.  The tarman, the iconic zombie from the classic 1985 original, makes an appearance too, but it's far too brief to warrant any merit in watching this drek.",1169683200,8,973,4.666666666666667

2727751,1,B000M9BPFI,"""Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave"" (2005) is, in short, not scary nor funny, another disaster in this series. I thought ""Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis"" (2005) was so awful, enough terrible to become the nail in the series' coffin, but I was wrong. They made another sequel which is worse than the previous ""ROTLD."" Considering the badness of `Necropolis,' this is kind of amazing.

Actually ""Necropolis"" and ""Rave to the Grave"" (the fourth and fifth entries in `Return of the Living Dead' series) were shot back to back in Romania. Director for both films is Ellory Elkayem (`Eight Legged Freaks""), and `Rave to the Grave"" features some of the stars of `Necropolis' including Peter Coyote, Aimee-Lynn Chadwick, Cory Hardrict and John Keefe.

`Rave to the Grave' is about the high school students who survived the terrible zombie outbreak in the previous film. They are now college students and this time one of them finds a dusty canister in the attic, but instead of leaving it alone or reporting to the police, he and his friends take a sample of the slimy liquid inside and bring it to the laboratory in the campus. And ... here is the silliest part ... one student makes a drug called `Z' out of the sample and starts to sell it on campus.

`Rave to the Grave"" relies on this silly one-joke idea about the zombie drug that not only makes people act like zombies, but actually turns them into real ones. The film runs out of steam halfway through the story, and the rest of it is about the repetitious battles between zombies and humans that are neither thrilling nor funny to see. Two `Men-in-Black'-like hitmen are added to the humorless story of teenager zombie attack, but their downbeat humor does not work with the weak and pointless direction that fails to make the entire film a real gorefest or campy fun.

The only good thing about the film is you can see Tarman Zombie, but only briefly. Except for one mildly amusing scene, he has nothing to do in the film. He appears and stays out of the film most of the time. This is definitely the worst film in the `Return of the Living Dead' series, and probably nearly as bad as the notorious ""House of the Dead.""",1169078400,37,2189,4.59079283887468
2727752,1,B000M9BPFI,"Why do I keep comin' back to these movies?  After ""3"" (or after Lionsgate got a hold of the series)I shoulda known that there was no hope for another descent film to come outta this series.  ""Rave From The Grave"" combines(tries to anyway) 2 of my favorite things in life.  Zombies & the underground DJ culture.  Let me just say, they fail miserably at both.  They filmed this movie back to back with part 4, & anyone who saw part 4 should know thats not a good thing.  I'd say this one sucked worse than 3 & 4 combined.  The plot is some ""raver"" kids get ahold of the trioxin & some how get high off it in small doses.  They go and find their chemist buddy (stay with me, it get's better) & put the trioxin into a pill form to distribute all over there college campus.  They call the pill ""Z"" because ""you get so high & tripped out, you're like""... wait for it...  ""a zombie"".  Are the script writers in Hollywood all just completely retarded now, was that really the best that they could come up with?  Mean while there are these 2 ""secret service"" or ""Interpole"" guys with some of the thickest Italian accents I've ever heard are running around trying to find the missing drums.  You wind up waiting over an hour before anything really even happens.  The script, director, whatever, I don't know who's more to blame for this abomination, but how did this even get made?  The acting is HORRIBLE, you wanna see the lame azz characters(especialy the DJ guy, that loser needs a good punch in the face)killed in a grizzly horrible manner.  The make up & special effects are okay, but still nothing like they used to be in the 1st 2 films.  It's movies like this that give the Rave culture such a bad name.  It's very obvious they know nothing about the dance scene or Zombie movies.  It's a shame, they've efficiantly (I hope anyway)put the last nail in the coffin for this once great horror series.  It's a shame & there's really no excuse for this kind of sloppy movie making with such a beloved(well, not so much anymore, but it used to be)property.  Lionsgate knows good horror movies, that's apararant by watching titles like ""House of 1,000 Corpses"", ""The Descent"", ""Undead"", ""Saw"", ""Cube"", & ""Devils Rejects"".  Why they would do what they did to these last 2 movies... well like I said, there's just no excuse.  Thanks again Lionsgate for ruining another property I truely used to care about.

2727777,2,B000M9BPFI,"This time around the scientist from the 4th movie has escaped with the canisters of the zombie chemical, and wants to sell them to these guys who won't buy it unless he proves it works. So he uses it on some dead bodies and gets eaten in the process. His other nefue, not the same as from the 4th movie, is informed his uncle has died. He goes to his uncles house and discovers two of the barrels with the chemicals in it, but does not know what it is. He has his scientist friend from college try to figure it out in his lab, and one of the most annoying characters in film history (a stoner) decided to taste the stuff, and trips out saying it is better then LSD. Without the guys permission, they harvest the chemical from the canister into drugs, and sell them to everyone at the college. The whole thing leads up to a rave party where everyone is taking the drug, and if you take too much, you become a zombie. Yes, the movie is about as stupid as it sounds.

However, there are some good points. One, a Tar Man like looking zombie makes an appearance, nice to see they finally brought one back. But then on the other hand, it still breaks the rule of the first 3 films, because bullets to the head is all it takes to kill a zombie! There are these two Russian guys trying to create some comic relief in the film. Some parts where dumb, but I did laugh a few times. Especially when he blows away 2 zombies in a car with a bazooka and says a line that i'm sure would be a cult favorite had this movie been a bit better.

Overall, out of all the ROTLD movies, I still only highly recommend the first 2 films. I myself kind of enjoyed the 4th, but I can understand why people wouldn't, so I won't recommend it to you. With this one here, if you have seen the first 3, loved them so much you would want to see 4 and 5, even knowing they break rules and they don't compete with 1 and 2, then sure, find this movie and have a watch.

In this one they take zombie juice from the canistors and become the wrong kind of zombie.  In other words these zombies eat people and not their brains. The humor is strickly drug related , I think , like the fourth one that someone who never saw the first three movies made this. In romania or russia , just like the fourth one.  Still it has a few moments of fun, but it should have stuck to the mythos of the first thrre movies which are very good. I have all five and even though this is a bad movie , I love bad b movies too, it smears the name of the original with it's loss of sticking to what the first three were about. I would welcome a blu ray with the last three together though.  I collect series of movies. But on dvd this looks fine, and I would have been more forgiving if it didn't have the 'return of  the living dead' name on it.

Needless to say, the partygoers begin having a bad trip when their friends start eating one another. After the empty rehash used in the previous sequel, this off-beat premise chocked full of low brow humor is a welcome change-up for the series. Ellory Elkayem returns to the director's chair, bringing with him the same gratuitous gore and practical FX that stood out in part 4. The poorly written characters are more easily forgivable thanks to the mindless comedy and toilet humor, while the pacing is maintained thanks to a steady stream of blood that makes it way through the entire picture. RAVE even includes a gooey new (though not necessarily improved) Tar Man in addition to the countless other ghouls. For a film subtitled RAVE TO THE GRAVE, this series closer delivers on all the stupid fun and zombie mayhem that the title suggests.

2727783,2,B000M9BPFI,"""Rave to the Grave"", yeah man, awesome idea . . . NOT! On a high note though, it is better than House of the Dead was, but is that really a good thing? The film stars the same cast, with a few extra people, that were in ROTLD Necropolis, mainly because both films were made back to back. The difference is that Necropolis is a better movie than this one. Read on, if curious.

Yeah, so Trioxin ""5"". the same kind as was used in the prequel (which I suppose might be a cheap way of explaining why these Zombies can die by being shot in the head) is found in a basement of the main bad guy in Necropolis by his nephew. The genius kids then try it out and trip on the substance. Basically it is engineered to become a drug called ""Z"". Ravers love it and a rave happens and all Hell breaks loose as the party goers turn into, you guessed it, Zombies! Yeah, so also during all of this, there are a couple of secret government guys trying to get their hands on the Trioxin. This whole thing culminates into one of the worst cheeseball endings in a Zombie film I have seen in a long time.

In all fairness, this really is not the worst Zombie film I have ever seen, but sadly, it is nowhere close to the best. If you are a fan of the series, this is not what you want to see, trust me. Go rent or buy the first three films and be happy. Rent or buy the 4th film even and pretend it is a film on it's own but man, this is the worst of the series. I hope we get another film in the series, but one that adheres to the original material and can wash this film away.",1263945600,,1555,3.9648562300319488
2727784,2,B000M9BPFI,"I liked  Dead 5 better than 4, but that isn't saying much. At least it isn't filmed in total darkness. Both 4 and 5 have lead sound tracks that weigh down the film. Music, dubbing, and incidental music. A little work on the bad music, the film would have been better.  If you turn off the sound and watch it like a TV in a bar the film becomes better. I found Dead 5 to have it's moments, it isn't as bad as some of the reviewers said.  They were trying, but didn't make it. I don't think the script was as bad as they make out either. If I was a teacher I would give it a C+. If it had  better music a B. It was and sounds like a European made film.",1254528000,,650,3.7925925925925927
2727785,1,B000M9BPFI,"Hands down the dumbest film ever. The major plothole between four and five seems like it never happened and that kid didn't seemed to learn the first time. This time 2-4-5 Trioxin becomes the latest Raver drug, only to have Romero-esque flesh-eating zombies that die when you shoot them in the head.

Return of the Living Dead, the very first film, the zombies could not die unless you nuked them off the face of the planet! That means you can shoot them in the head and chop them into pieces, and the pieces will still come after you. Also, this was the start of the Brain-eating zombies, which was decided in the first film as Dan 0'Bannon didn't want to step all over Romero's toes.

This doesn't even register as a comedy, nor should be considered a film at all. I read the infamous Uwe Boll on here somewhere and that's exactly the kind of disappointment this goes for.

Bury this one in the Sierra Nevada somewhere, or better yet shoot the master print into the sun so it can never be released again!",1252800000,4,1006,4.456521739130435

2727787,2,B000M9BPFI,"Should Police Academy 5 have been made?  Was there any reason for the fifth installment of Nightmare on Elm Street?  Were there really enough flesh-hungry, monstrous sharks to make Jaws 4?  The answer to all questions is obviously ""no"", but they were no doubt better than this cheapquel.

The gist of this story is about some crazy drug found by some dim-witted college students.  They take it without knowing what it is, and nickname it ""Z"" because it makes people zombie-like when they are high.  What nobody knows is that the drug kills, and eventually leads to zombie regeneration - not to mention explosive gas and hallucinations.  It's just too bad the movie didn't stay true to the zombie genre; instead, these zombies maintain both muscular and vocal ability (""Brains!"").  When a greasy drug dealer gets his hands on the stash, he decides to sell it to college kids at a rave.  Lambs to the slaughter, I tell ya.

Insert a few cheesy deaths - ""drumsticks to the eyes"" was a good one - and multiple decapitations.  The requisite bad jokes while dispatching zombies or being slaughtered by them are also there.

The movie has absolutely horrible makeup and special effects, but somewhat makes up for it by including more skull-chomping and head-shot scenes than in any movie in cinema history.  Adding an incredibly lame script, including the most ridiculous scene involving fellatio and a line about Olive Garden in cinema history (even if there are no others), sure doesn't help.

Credit has to be given to the makers of this movie, however, for finding the most zombie-like actors around.  Their rigidity and blank visages made the portrayal of the brain-dead nearly effortless.

If you can stick around until the end, I can only warn you about the ending: it's atrocious.",1225238400,,1781,4.867109634551495

This part is even worse than the last part , part 4 ""necropolis"" , lot's of plot holes , bad actors ,bad script, simple terrible.

2727792,5,B000M9BPFI,"Awesome!

I am a horror fan from Germany.
""Rave to the grave"" is one of my favorites.
It contains a lot of horror sequences which were cut out in Germany (about 20 or so). So I buyed it in USA via amazon.com.

So, as you can guess, this film contains a lot of heavy, heavy horror sequences.

And it is funny, too.

And beautiful Jenny Mollen plays a leading part.
And much more beauties have at least a short appearence in this film.

There is, however, a longer ""unrated"" version available in Canada.

You will enjoy it!

Kind regards,
