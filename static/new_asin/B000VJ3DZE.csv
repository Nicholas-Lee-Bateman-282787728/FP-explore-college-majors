8219018,5,B000VJ3DZE,Bought this for my step son for Christmas because he is needing help with building character and he loves anything cars since both his daddy and step dad are mechanics. So I'm excited that he's going to be learning while watching something he loves. The shipping was fast on our order I received them earlier then expected now I can't wait for him to open them so we can watch them.,1450310400,,382,4.394366197183099
