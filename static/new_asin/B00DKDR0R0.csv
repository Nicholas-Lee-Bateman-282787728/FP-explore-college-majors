5825143,5,B00DKDR0R0,Gives an overview of the basics.  Good info for the beginner in quantum physics.  It will make a newcomer curious as to what it is all about.,1380844800,7,141,4.185185185185185
5825144,1,B00DKDR0R0,"Not even worth viewing. these ""scientist/spiritualists"" are shallow and incredibly naive. I've never taken a course in quantum mechanics and I could explain the anomalies they are discussing with far greater accuracy and truth. Stay away from this one!!!",1471478400,,254,5.538461538461538

5825146,4,B00DKDR0R0,"This movie was well done, giving a very good introduction to some of the current theories that tie spirituality to scientific foundations.  Plenty of helpful food for thought here.",1467504000,,180,5.206896551724138
5825147,5,B00DKDR0R0,This is an interesting subject and complex. I enjoyed the way it is presented with the various people explaining their thoughts about it. I keep watching as much as I can find on the topic.,1465603200,,189,4.428571428571429

5825154,5,B00DKDR0R0,"Finally The true understanding. they proved and help explain my theories on all of these subjects. They won't say the word Spiritual Reality but, the do tell of physical reality. I am pleased that they did indeed prove the existence of GOD.",1445558400,,240,4.738095238095238

5825162,1,B00DKDR0R0,"bad, bad, bad - a bunch of talking heads expounding on their collective ignorance",1430092800,2,81,4.857142857142857
5825163,5,B00DKDR0R0,Good information,1430006400,,16,7.5
5825164,1,B00DKDR0R0,Inferior attempt to explain complex subject. Many interviews without much effort at adding any value to the production through other means.,1429833600,2,139,5.666666666666667
5825165,5,B00DKDR0R0,great,1428537600,2,5,5.0
5825166,4,B00DKDR0R0,Fascinating & enlightening,1425945600,,26,8.0
5825167,5,B00DKDR0R0,Though the quality of the film is poor - the message is incredible - life changing!!,1424390400,,84,4.3125
5825168,5,B00DKDR0R0,Really  makes  a lot of common sense.,1420156800,,37,4.142857142857143
5825169,4,B00DKDR0R0,Very cerebral and you must have an open mind when you watch this.  I would recommend watching their movie Leap! before watching this one.,1419638400,3,137,4.708333333333333
5825170,5,B00DKDR0R0,Well done especially for the non-scientist.  Really enjoyed the video and learned a lot!,1419465600,2,88,5.285714285714286
5825171,4,B00DKDR0R0,Fascinating and worth watching as it explores the almost unknown (and possibly unknowable) quantum universe which forms all that we are but remains a hidden mystery.,1418860800,4,165,5.384615384615385
5825172,5,B00DKDR0R0,thank you,1418256000,,9,4.0
5825173,3,B00DKDR0R0,Nothing new.,1413676800,,12,5.5
5825174,1,B00DKDR0R0,"I had to stop this video after 20 minutes or so because the presentation was as if many blind men touched an elephant from their respective places and gave a lecture on the nature of the elephant without being ever able to grasp the entirety of the animal.  Some of these clowns may be sincere, but they are not much different than anyone who thinks they know the universe and only looks for some sort of support for what they have decided they know.  To think that human awareness is some sort of cosmic or spiritual connection with reality is juvenile hogwash.  As humans, we are limited in experience and conception of a reality that is only possible for humans.  Science has already demonstrated many times over that there are elements of the universe that are so far removed from human perception that it is highly unlikely that the relatively uninformed ""gurus"" presenting their dogmas in this film have the slightest mental capacity to tell another person what the true reality(s) or nature(s) of the universe might be.  I can't find this film any more interesting than Timothy Leary describing the universe under the influence of LSD.  If you have half a brain skip this one.  If you are looking to bite upon a hook and be reeled into someone's limited imagination, then you have a need that the film producers are expecting to make some money fulfilling.",1413331200,8,1363,4.701680672268908
5825175,2,B00DKDR0R0,It was okay. Basically conversations with theorists and scientists in their living rooms and offices though. Some good insights but lacking as a good documentary.,1410825600,5,162,5.52
5825176,1,B00DKDR0R0,"Only talks about the basics of Quantum Physics all from at least 30 years ago, never really makes any conclusions, just says things are like X.

The entire video is just low video quality interviews with people, pretty much no animation or narration.",1409529600,4,250,4.813953488372093
5825177,5,B00DKDR0R0,Loved this production,1409270400,,21,6.333333333333333
5825178,5,B00DKDR0R0,"I have never written a review on a movie before but this movie definitely deserves one. If you are serious about answers to your faith and EAGER to know truth (not just holding on to things your church and culture have fed you) I highly recommend this film. I have been doing contemplative prayer/meditation for 10 years now, and now live with a peace I cannot describe. It sounds so counterintuative to sit for 20 minutes a day to watch your thoughts and let them go, but as all the great mystics/masters say, something changes inside without you even knowing it -- and it does (it may take time to start seeing results but they are incredible when they come).  This film does a great job explaining, scientifically, the possibilities of why these positive changes occur. If you are truly interested in transforming your life, and do not mind putting in some effort, this film may be a good place to start. I hope it opens your heart and mind to live a beautiful life!",1408752000,23,969,4.537142857142857
5825179,5,B00DKDR0R0,Really makes one think!,1408752000,,23,5.0
5825180,1,B00DKDR0R0,"I just have one question.......  who would give this 5 stars? It's a bunch of unknown physicist who apparently couldn't keep up
in the scientific realm so switched to the religious realm but keep talking about science. Some of these characters aren't even physicist.
One was an anesthesiologist. Thanks for the input...... NOT. Amazon should not sell (or rent or whatever) this kind of tapioca.
If you want to know about quantum physics go somewhere else.  If you want to know about mysticism... go somewhere else.  Just go
somewhere else and save your hard earned yams. That's all I've got to say about that.",1408579200,6,609,4.836538461538462
5825181,5,B00DKDR0R0,This has the potential to cause a major paradigm shift in your view of life.  I absolutely LOVED this documentary,1405814400,,113,4.65
5825182,4,B00DKDR0R0,"This program is packed with wisdom and information that really did shake up my concept of reality.... In a good way.  While I found it profoundly interesting, I did have to close my eyes at times because the editing and graphics were annoying.  Actually, the background music was disturbing as well, at times.  Yet, despite the simplistic nature of the videography, I have watched this show over and over, and will continue to watch is repeatedly as each time I learn something new and am profoundly changed by the knowledge.",1401408000,10,525,4.811111111111111
5825183,4,B00DKDR0R0,"I really wanna like this more, and overall there's a lot of good information in this dvd, but this really feels like a re-hashing of his other previously released dvds, like Leap! and Quantum Leap.  There's some new footage, but it seems to be taken from the previously shot interviews that were featured in his other movies.  This time there's no guru-puppet though.  If you haven't seen the Leap movies, and you're interested in quantum physics and spiritual concepts suchas the idea that we're all connected (Law of One) then this is a good purchase, but I personally think the best one Ike has made is Leap!  Ike's narration always seems a bit dry in these movies - it would be better to get someone else to take over that role!  However, he's delivering such good material, so we gotta give thanks for that!  Ike we need some fresh new material!  For any that are interested in this subject do yourself a favor and watch Inner Worlds, Outer Worlds.  It's available to watch for free but well worth purchasing!  Much higher replay value, production quality and some great meditative music and visuals throughout the impressive 3 to 4 hour length!  (Unfortunately it's not available through Amazon).",1386806400,14,1202,4.79126213592233

8594106,5,B00DKDR0R0,Great movie if one is interested in spirituality & quantum physics!,1485734400,,67,5.181818181818182
8594107,4,B00DKDR0R0,"The rest of the room loved it and I probably would have too, if I hadn't already seen so many of the productions talked about and covered in this film.  It was an excellent overview, though.",1484524800,,190,4.277777777777778
8594108,5,B00DKDR0R0,I thought it was good though nothing new,1483833600,,40,4.125
8594109,1,B00DKDR0R0,"I was very interested in this video having read The Tao of Physics many years ago.  However, if you read that book and know the basics of quantum physics this video offers no insight.  It is just clips of people giving their speculations on quantum physics.  Poorly put together.  Not insightful or entertaining",1481241600,,311,4.811320754716981
