7846654,5,6303439187,"Never Say Nefir: Genie feels useless against a maniacal imp who uses a colossal, dancing (& anthromorphic) rhino to destroy an entire city - every single night.  Putting an end to this royal scam is no shoe-in until Genie shows off some truly amazing ""feets""!  This is a very funny episode.  The first of three appearances of Nefir & the Imps & while the others were good too this was the best.  You've gotta love that giant pink dancing rhinoceros.  A+

The Citadel:  Aladdin is forced to do an evil sorceror's dirty work when Genie becomes the blue-plate special for an out of control magic eating beast!  But collaring the beast unleashes the sorceror's craving for the magic of Agrabah!  The introduction for Mozenrath, who aside from Mirage is the most popular of the villain in this series, because fangirls (fanboys for Mirage) think they're sexy.  He's a good villain, but not my favorite.  Still, this is a great episode for him.  A

Like I said, another tape worth having in your collection.",1365465600,,1001,4.716763005780347
