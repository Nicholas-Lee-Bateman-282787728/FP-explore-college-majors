There is a lot of the F... word used and the acting is definitively amateur but it has a certain charm for a locally produced film on a very small budget.",1356307200,,287,4.415094339622642
8508091,5,B0071BY25K,"This movie is not a multi million dollar hollywood blockbuster. It's a low budget film by up and coming director Nathan Oliver. if your looking for big budget thrills, look elswhere. if you're looking for a zombie movie that pays tribute to the classics, then this is it! it's your standard zombie outing, but it's best charm is in it's writing. The one liners and joke pay tribute to some of the best, most classic zombie movies of all time. i give it's writing 10 out of 10.

Technically, this is a low budget movie, so don't expect blu-ray hi def visuals. it does great to capture the feel of b movie horror, and that in itself isn't really good. it succeeds at what it set out to do, but what that is isn't something most filmmakers would want to emulate. i give it's visuals a 6 out of 10.

SOundwise, the effects are great, but the best part is the music. one of the big players in the music of this movie is indie rock legend John Nels, and his take and style of music fits in well with the zombie appocalypse feeling. 10 out of 10.

overall, this isn't zombieland, and it isn't a movie for eveyone. but this movie definitely deserves a place among collectors and hardcore zombie fans such as myself. overall rating: 7 out of 10",1344643200,,1235,4.337662337662338

8508093,5,B0071BY25K,"Ok, so I might be a little partial to this movie, but when taking into consideration the available resources, this has to be the BEST MOVIE to ever come out of northern Maine... Just saying ;)",1330646400,,192,4.361111111111111
