8443942,3,B004VRO84M,"This was an odd story. Unfortunately, Sylvester McCoy, was saddled with a mediocre script along with a producer and script writer who changed things to make stories ""edgier"". They made things sillier in my opinion but McCoy does his best to bring this story up a few notches.

The concept of the story actually wasn't that bad and this could have been so much better if those in charge did things more like it was with the previous Doctor rather than tinkering with it.",1496016000,,469,4.583333333333333
