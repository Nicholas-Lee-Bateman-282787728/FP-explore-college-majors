4709493,5,B005IGX4HW,"Teepa Snow is THE expert in how Alzheimer's affects individuals living with this condition and furthermore, she is very much aware of how fatigued caregivers become when providing 24/7 care at home or out-of-home. I have had the pleasure and honor to attend a dementia conference in Florida last year and witnessed first hand Teepa's approaches and methods. It is a fact that Alzheimer's is a progressive and predictable course with no cause nor a cure. However the person living with Alzheimer's is still all there ~ they simply forget things and process information differently. Learning to speak Alzheimer's and using Teepa's methods will make all the difference in the world for the person living with Alzheimer's and their caregiver, no matter whether at home or out-of-home. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone. Activities is important in promoting engagement and improving the quality of life. This is something I like to stress and have documented at Remembering4You (dot) Com.
