224260,5,6300198731,"Two great actors: Richard Burton and Peter O'toole performing their characters at the peak of their abilities. An intense drama where you may realize that heroicism, the love for the truth, and the reachness of justice are the authentic values and parameters for any person, under any circustamces any time.",994896000,,307,5.16
224261,5,6300198731,"""Becket.""  Now THERE is a marvelous movie... probably one of the finest ""biopics"" ever written!!  It tells the story of the relationship between two men: King Henry II of England, great-grandson to William the Conqueror, and Thomas Becket, a Saxon nobleman, a close friend of King Henry's, and, ultimately, Archbishop of Canterbury.

As our story unfolds, Henry and Becket are inseparable friends. They spend their days feasting at banquets, carousing, wenching, and hunting. Henry (played by Peter O'Toole) appoints Becket (Richard Burton) to the post of Chancellor of England - the equivalent of Prime Minister and Treasurer. Becket is a man completely loyal to the King, and a man with a curious sense of honor. ""Honor is a private matter within,"" he tells Henry early in the film. ""It's an idea, and every man has his own version of it.""

""Becket"" is ultimately a story of ""the honor of God"" versus ""I am your king."" In an effort to gain the upper hand in the ongoing controversy between the Church and state, Henry names Becket to the post of Archbishop of Canterbury. In Thomas Becket, the King sees a loyal servant who will place the wishes of his monarch before everything else. Unfortunately, the King's hopes for an easy time of it are soon dashed.  After becoming the primate of England, Becket  rediscovers his personal sense of honor. To Becket, ""the honor of God"" becomes worthy of defending against all who would attack the Church... even if the attacker is the King.  When one of Henry's noblemen kills a priest, Becket orders him haled before an ecclesiastical court. The inevitable showdown between King and Archbishop is at hand.

 Despite the King's insistence, he refuses to budge from his position that the church courts have jurisdiction in this and all similar cases. His continuing defiance of the King sends Henry into increasingly virulent paroxysms of rage against his former friend. ""I am your king!"" he repeatedly tells Becket.

Ultimately, Becket is forced to flee England, but returns after seven years, having agreed to a series of compromises with the King, but not conceding the main points of his argument. The truce is short lived, however. Becket continues to resist Henry's efforts to intrude into Church affairs. Henry, enraged once again, fills the air with oaths against his new-found foe, asking at one point: ""Will no-one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" On December 29, 1170, four of his barons assassinate Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the altar of Canterbury Cathedral.

""Becket""  is based on the stage play of the same name by French playwright Jean Anouilh, and adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt (who won the 1964 ""Best Screenplay"" Academy Award for his efforts). It was also nominated for 11 other Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor.

This is one of those movies where words can't really convey the depth and quality of the performances turned in by its stars. It's rare to find a film with one performance of such great magnitude; I don't ever recall seeing two such brilliant performances in one movie! For Burton and O'Toole are so very good in their roles as Becket and Henry, that they seem almost to become the very characters they're playing. Their acting is refined, unaffected, completely without ego, almost effortless.

""Becket""  is one of those good old-fashioned movies so popular forty years ago... the kind with world-class actors delivering lines from a superb screenplay; with an interesting subject at its heart; sumptuous sets; and colorful costumes. Maybe the film doesn't quite match the tastes of today's moviegoers as well as it did 37 years ago; but, if you're looking for some first-rate entertainment by the best actors in the business, ""Becket"" is indeed an excellent choice!",991958400,289,3785,4.995230524642289
224262,4,6300198731,"""Becket"" was an interesting film.  It had its laughs, it had its gasps.  The title character, Thomas a Becket, is Richard Burton in an excellent, challenging role, and I could imagine no one else but Peter O'Toole as the jerk-of-a-king Henry II.  The plot centers around the two lifelong friends Thomas and Henry, and the consequences that ensued after Henry crowns Thomas Chancellor of England, and eventually Archbishop of Canterbury.  The problem with Thomas is that he takes his job very seriously.  Being archbishop of England is no joking matter.  So Thomas defies the king to preserve the honor of God.
My favorite character was Brother John, a Saxon monk who wants nothing more than to whack a Norman over the head with the silver crucifix.
My least favorite and character with the most laughs was Henry II.  He was such a loser, but weren't most medieval kings of England?  This opens a lot of plot opportunities.  When a woman stabs herself, Henry staggers into Thomas' quarters and whines, ""Thomas, help me, there's blood everywhere!""  You also get a glimpse of the friction in Henry's family life, which is explored more in ""The Lion in Winter"".  (See the title of my review.)
The end of Becket is a real tear-jerker, so keep the Kleenex nearby.  But you'll feel vindicated as Thomas is pronounced a saint (and when Henry pays pennance.)
All over, an enjoyable watch.  Go out and rent this one if you like cultured things.
Happy viewing, Dani Girl",978480000,3,1459,4.788

224265,5,6300198731,"Becket is one of the most accurate history films available. There is, however one glaring imperfection. Eleanor of Aquitaine, his queen, is portrayed as a whinning, nagging twit. This was one of the most dynamic  women of any era. See Kathryn Hepburn's personification in ""The Lion  in Winter"" for an amazing performance which is in agreement with most  historical sources. Further, Peter O'Toole plays King Henry to perfection  in this one as well. King Henry's mother, the indomitable Matilda, deserves  a better characterization than she receives here. Henry II a most loving  and indulgent father when his children were young, an impression in this  film that he bullied his children would be in error. But - buy the movie! I  never read about Henry II without picturing Peter O'Toole!",963360000,,789,5.062015503875969
224266,4,6300198731,"Perhaps the movie is less than historically accurate; perhaps the video quality leaves much to be desired; but the shear power of Richard Burton as Thomas Becket and Peter O'Toole as his king cannot be denied.
Richard Burton delivers an understated performance that plays very well off of  Peter O'Toole's highly energetic Henry II.  He uses his voice to bring out  subtle nuances of his character (something that is overlooked by many  contemporary actors) and gives his Thomas Becket a slow and thoughtful  demeanor.  I do quibble technique on one point -- I thought that the scene  when his gives away his worldly goods could have been played with a bit  more energy; but that was Richard Burton's choice and undeniably, he  interpretation of the character is wonderful.
Peter O'Toole plays Henry  II with a gusto that is a pleasure to watch.  With his caustic wit and  rapier like tongue, he Henry II is a man that is caught in the middle  between barons who have little regard for intellect and his best friend who  is noted for his intellect.  Henry II is an intelligent king, but not as  gifted as Thomas Becket -- and he acknowledges this many times.
I'm about  to break one of the reviewer rules here -- I'm going to reference another  film and make a recommendation.  Watch Becket as part one of a double  feature, with a Lion in Winter as part two.  The two films make a natural  double feature because one, Peter O'Toole is in both as Henry II and two,  both films are wonderful gifts for film lovers who like their actors to act  and not be simply action heroes.",957225600,13,1575,4.58273381294964

224268,5,6300198731,"When I first saw Becket I was a teenager with little interest in either acting or history. I went because a female friend asked me to. Sometime during the movie, I was captivated by the power which Peter O'Toole and  Richard Burton gave to their respective characters.  I happened to find  the video two years ago and bought it. The video quality is good; The  staging is very good; The acting is superb. Historically it takes some  license. As the reviewer from the U.K. mentions, Becket was born in  Normandy. His education and mother were French. It would not win the  History Channel's award, but it came in a close second for the Academy  awards best picture, and I feel deservedly so.",954374400,2,690,4.598360655737705

Richard Burton does an excellent portrayal of Becket as Peter O'Toole does of portraying Henry II.  Although the film takes liberties of  the historical events of the lives of these two, it doesn't in anyway  effect the plot and drama of the movie.  A great scene in the movie is when  Becket (Burton) says to Henry II (O'Toole) ""do not do this"" when  Henry II insists that Becket takes the title of Archbiship.  It would be  interesting to know what the actual thoughts of Thomas Becket were when we  was offered the office of Archbishop in the 12th century.

224374,5,6300198731,"Today (21st of December) is the Feast Day of Saint Thomas  Becket. I remember reading Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (during my high school years) about the social drama of pilgrimages to visit his tomb in the medieval times and there was a sincere religiosity and piety to respect his sacred person while still having fun on the way (England's El Camino). Unfortunately, in 1538 a certain despot decided to demolish his bones and relics in order to obliterate this tradition. But in vain! The memory of Becket lives on. The superb actor Peter O'Toole played his friend/enemy King Henry II in the movie, while Richard Burton did quite the outstanding job playing The Saint-Archbishop himself. Becket proves that a sinner can become a great saint, and the right way to God (The Religion God instituted) is about following the true order of things set out from hence all rightness must flow and sometimes one must lay down oneself for that cause as Jesus Christ and His Apostles did. Church-State relations is an on-going saga and each particular event has its own synergies, challenges, and results, but nonetheless we must learn from history and understand its significance through our own times and look forward to the future courses of life. One really fun note is that you will you see glimpses of Latin Ritual traditions and Anglo-Saxon-Norman courtly life throughout the film.

224491,4,6300198731,"Review of Becket
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

Becket is a mans movie. I don't think there are any women in the cast, or if there are, they have very insignificant parts. My brother, who has been known to tolerate rather than enjoy old movies, loved this movie. Whenever he talks about the classic film genre, he says, You know what movie I liked? Becket!

The only bad part of the movie is what happened during the 1965 awards season. Richard Burton and Peter OToole were repeatedly pitted against each other in the Best Actor category. If only tied awards were more prevalent. Both men were nominated for the 1965 Oscar, and Rex Harrison ran away with the gold for his bored, flippant, tired, lousy performance in My Fair Lady. If that doesnt make you lose faith in the Academy, just wait two more years for Richard Burton to once again lose the gold in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons. Just terrible.

Anyway, back to Becket. If you like Richard Burton or Peter OToole, you need to watch it. Their performances are fantastic beyond description; you could watch it ten times and still come out with a tie as to who gave a better performance. Pete plays King Henry II, and Dick plays Becket. The king and the archbishop differ in their core beliefs, but will religion get in the way of their friendship? Will Becket compromise his morals to stay a loyal friend to the king?

The historical friendship between the two real life figures is written out thoughtfully and rivetingly, even though the story was originally based off a play. Yes, its wordy, but none of the speeches are wasteful or boring. Its incredibly thought-provoking, constantly pulling the audience both ways. Both characters are likable and both sides of the debate are understandable. And since the actors were famous friends offscreen, its that much more enjoyable to watch them verbally spar with each other onscreen. Its a true masterpiece.",1500595200,,1954,4.721407624633431

224498,5,6300198731,"This 1964 film received well-deserved high acclaim by viewers and critics and Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole were praised highly for their acting in the film. The film is based on a play and parts of it may not be true. For example, the general consensus is that Becket was a Norman, as were his two parents. Also, there is no indication that Becket joined Henry in whoring and other debauchery before he became Archbishop. There is no certainty that Henry expected Becket to support his position that the church and its clergy must be subservient to the crown. Nevertheless, the general mood and theme of the play and film are correct: Henry wanted Becket to support his view, Becket refused.
The following are some other facts and explanations: Becket was born around 1119 and assassinated as shown in the film in 1170. It is generally believed that Henry did not explicitly order Beckets murder but used words that could be interpreted as such. What exactly these words were is in dispute. Becket was canonized by Pope Alexander III soon after his death.
The Normans were descendants of Norse and they gave their name to the northern region of France sometime in the tenth or eleventh century; Normandy is based on Norseman.
William the Conqueror came to England with his Norman army and defeated the Saxons at the battle of Hastings in 1066. Henry II was his great grandson.

224593,2,6300198731,"One of the first things that comes to mind is whether or not Andrew Jackson, one of the Founding Fathers and authors of the American Constitution, and with all certainty a true scholar; took into account the story of the adversarial nature of King Henry II and Thomas Becket when he considered the gravity of the issues regarding the separation of church and state.
This is purely a matter of idle speculation and has nothing to do with the content of the Broadway play by Jean Anouih upon which this movie was produced.
Mr. Anouih himself stated that the play was filled with many historical inaccuracies, and although it may have been a brilliantly dramatic stage production, it does not translate well onto the big screen.

It is highly romanticized and overly sentimental to the point of being ridiculous; although it was a pleasure to see Richard Burton finally break free of his over reliance on the sometimes overbearing mode of Shakespearian acting and depict his character with real spontaneity and intuition.

Peter O'Toole was hemmed in by the script and almost unbearable to watch; although he did his best as he always does.
There are certain scenes that made me cringe in helpless despair.
The character of Henry II as it was scripted, was entirely not in keeping with the personae of a man who was an adroit and accomplished ruler; a political power broker who ruled with an unyielding and conniving intelligence.

The inclusion of the mother and queen were ineffectual and entirely unnecessary.
The formidable talents of Martita Hunt are disgraced and beneath the dignity of an actress of her caliber.

Becket is portrayed as a man who is possessed, seemingly overnight, by the Spirit of God and the scene in which he is depicted as having doubts about being elevated to the dual roles as both Chancellor and Archbishop is sadly underplayed.
The only scene that piqued my interest was the Popes' refusal to permit Becket to step down as Archbishop, knowing full well that he would serve as a convenient sacrificial lamb to glorify the act of martyrdom leading to eventual Sainthood on behalf of Rome.

This seems to be the case throughout the entire movie wherein important pivotal moments which might have redeemed a modicum of the  convenient historical inaccuracies are barely acknowledged.

My Cambridge Audio receiver does a nice job of upscaling 1080P video, but if it's a lower quality than the video suffers. But this 50+ year old film holds up amazingly well, due to the obviously excellent remastering job that was done. You can only expect so much from surround tracks created for movies that were not recorded in any type of surround mode, but again, I think that they have done as nice a job as could be expected.

224727,2,6300198731,"I wanted to watch this because I hadn't seen it before, and it's a classic.  I borrowed the DVD from the library to watch it.

 I have a lot of respect for Burton, O'Toole, and Gielgud.  However I found the movie painful to watch.  I almost stopped watching it less than halfway through, but I did finish watching it.  I felt that O'Toole's character, Henry, was extremely annoying and flat. I felt that Burton's was too reserved and restrained.  I don't know if the decision to portray the two main characters this way was the writer's, the actors', or the director's.  Why wouldn't the two main characters be more rounded?  Gielgud's part was small, but to me it was one of the best aspects of the film.

One of my reasons for not liking the film is the way ALL the women were portrayed and treated.  It was especially puzzling to me that O'Toole's Henry railed at his mother and his wife, and never showed them any kindness, consideration or respect.  He was also consistently mean and bullying to his children in this film.

This is from the Wikipedia article about the 1964 film Becket (comparing the film with the historical record):
""Henry's mother, Empress Matilda, died in 1167, three years before the treaty of Frteval allowed Becket to return in England. Henry appears to not have any respect for his mother and treats her as something of an annoyance, a rather drastic departure from what is generally held as historical fact. Empress Matilda was Henry's sole parent for much of his childhood, and she was instrumental in shaping Henry into the fierce warrior and skilled administrator he was. Far from seeing his mother as a burden, Henry seems to have adored Matilda and relied heavily on her advice and guidance until her death.""",1475020800,,1744,4.697368421052632

The script give no sense of how or why that happened, which makes the movie feel unreal. One moment Becket  is subservient to a fault to Henry, then suddenly a priest radiating holiness and high principle. Both Burton and O'Toole were great actors and capable of doing much more, but the script they followed treats their characters in a very one-dimensional way. Burton's Becket is just unemotional and cold, O'Toole's Henry II is just capricious, hedonistic and self-absorbed and nothing more. Worse, it was boring.",1462752000,,695,4.889830508474576

224827,5,6300198731,"Becket is one of those good, old-fashioned epic biopics that were very popular in the mid 1960s. (Other films in the same genre and from the same era include Lawrence of Arabia, Cleopatra,  The Agony and the Ecstasy, and A Man for All Seasons.)

Becket is the story of two men  King Henry II of England and Thomas Becket, who was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Henry in 1162. In the film, Henry and Becket begin as close friends, with Becket sharing in much of his Kings debauchery.  Henrys appointment of Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury is a political move intended to solidify the Kings power over the Church in England. However, much to the Kings surprise and outrage, Becket takes his new position seriously, and begins staunchly defending the Church against the King. Becket and Henry become bitter foes, and, as history records, this eventually cost Becket his life.

Becket stars two of the greatest English speaking actors of their generation: Richard Burton (Becket) and Peter OToole (Henry.)  They are in nearly every scene in the film, and simply illuminate the screen at all times. The screenplay was written by Edward Anhalt, and is based on a stage play written by playwrights Jean Anouilh and Lucienne Hill.

Ive owned a copy of Becket in every video format since the days of VHS tapes. I recently acquired my new Blu-ray version of the film, and was extremely pleased with the high quality of both the video and audio. The 1080p video is crisp, clear, and filled with fine detail. Colors are vivid, and the very light grain field gives the movie a nice filmic feel to it. The Dolby Digital Multichannel audio fills my room with a good, resonant sound. Neither Beckets video nor audio quite  rise to the reference levels of the best Blu-ray releases (The Sound of Music  and My Fair Lady 50th Anniversary Editions come to mind), but it certainly ranks among the better quality discs in my collection.

And, it is flawless in it's presentation. This superb production which is a Cinematic Classic from the halls of film epic's, which has been transferred to breathtaking High Definition (HD), comes to it's audience fully restored and in brilliant color, on a single, DVD-disc and is 150-minutes long. And, it comes complete with a commentary by Peter O'Toole (Henry II), a theatrical trailer, a TV-spot, archival interviews with Richard Burton (BECKET) and even, a still photo gallery. This film is based on actual English history, which has a young King Henry II naming his best friend, a boozing and womanizing buddy - Thomas BECKET, as Chancellor of all England. Then, out of spite to irritate and inflame the Church further, he appoints BECKET as Archbishop of Canterbury. Now, having propped up his friend to where he wanted him, the King had total control over Church and State. Or does he? BECKET stuns his friend - the King, by acting the mature and noble role as befitting a Chancellor, and that of a pious, humble and celibant, priest. And Henry the King, as well as Henry the man, can't handle either. Or the loss of a friend... especially, in such a manner. Realizing that BECKET is serious about his total turn around in character and habits, finds that his penitent and reverential behavior is in direct opposition to the King's reasons for placing him in such lofty positions, in the first place. It was all about control. And so, out of spiteful jealousy, the King retaliates by destroying BECKET, piece-by-piece. But, when BECKET under pressure to conform to the King's preconceived notions about how he should act refuses to yield, Henrys' vindicative jealousy and vengeful desire to control him, manifests in a sadistic, murderous, plot. This movie is mesmerizing drama, at it's best. An absolute 'must' for any serious, epic, DVD, classic film collector and a definite keeper for your home DVD library.

Now that I know more about the period I am disappointed in the portrayal of Eleanor of Aquitane (you wouldn't recognized the character at all) and his mother Maude. I mean these were women that, for one, would have trouble sitting in the same room with each other for any length of time. These are women who had both lead armies with a fair amount of success. Maude's father had named her his heir to the English thrown, then had fought for her right to be queen against Steven for years. Finally settling with him that he would be king, but her son (Henry) would be his heir. Eleanor had been queen of France, had daughters, and left them to marry Henry, but ruled in her own right in Aquitane. She had ruled and lead armies too, even been on Crusade. Of course THAT was a disaster, but she outlived Henry and several of her sons. The movie had them as prissy, fussy, useless court ladies. Sheesh.",1432598400,3,1180,4.2959641255605385

This does not sit well with the king for a variety of reasons, and the tension that mounts in the friendship makes for a very engaging and compelling historical drama.

225118,4,6300198731,"There are certain movies that are usually serious in tone, based on history or are drawn from the classics; that viewers are almost obligated to like. A cinematic version of ""eat your spinach"". Beckett is one of these moves. If I begin on a leery note my conclusion is that spinach should taste this good. While not certain of my research, this movie is more faithful to the tradition of the Beckett story than the actual history. It is based on an earlier French play and so much for the background.

I liked this move when I first saw it as a new release in the 1960's. I like it as a bookend with the Lion in Winter (Peter O Toole back, older and more commanding as Henry II) and like it.

Having already mentioned it, the older O'Toole playing the older Henry II in The Lion, is on every level a better performance. ""Better"" fails to convey just how much the actor had deepened and grown.  Growing into your role is a theme of Beckett and more of this in a moment. The great weakness of the younger O'Toole/Henry II is that this king is too broadly played and too shallow of a character. This may be the director's-Peter Glenville's fault. So much of this pouting king whining about his lost love, Thomas a Beckett leads one to wonder if the entire movie is intended as an effort to appeal to what would have been called the homosexual market. O'Toole can act (understatement) and performs well enough. The portrayal can be unpleasant to watch. Even his mother warns Henry that this love is ""unnatural"". Look for those moments when Henry II is not being a spoiled brat but a functioning monarch.

Richard Burton's Beckett is from the beginning a more powerful presence.  This Beckett is aware that he is compromised by his association with the crown, but believes that whoever his lord may be his fealty is to that person. This Beckett is strictly a member of the feudal system. Burton is his character and this character is his King's servant through wenching or ruling, even at the cost of love and faith. And then...

The King , almost as a joke, but in a moment of calculation appoints his man to the role of Archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the then Catholic Church in England. This places Beckett at a juncture. Is his new highest loyally to his King or his God? The other question is: Can a person grow into their new job, or must they prove themselves first? The very first minutes of the movie has a living King Henry visiting the elaborate tomb of a martyred Archbishop Thomas. This should be a clue even if you had never before been exposed to the story of the ""meddlesome priest"".

Beckett is intended as a thinking movie rather than an entertainment. There is sufficient depth to say that it succeeds at this level. There is shallowness to it as the set up to the final drama seems more a matter of stringing together episodes rather than an effort to have you share in the moral challenge.  Costumes are elaborate if no longer surprising. Sets have an unexpected simplicity, emphasizing that this was a more primitive England. That forks are a newly imported eating utensils gets at least two good laughs.

Beckett is worth at least one view and is better if you also have A Lion in Winter. This could have been a better movie, but I do like it.",1410825600,2,3268,4.488215488215488

225168,3,6300198731,"I confess that every time I try to sit through BECKET I give up after a few minutes.  I find the film disappointing in more ways than I can bear.  The photography is prosaic, the action tedious, the script cliche, the make-up and costumes uninteresting, and the performances phoned in.  Two stars, Burton and O'Toole, were expected somehow to make a pedestrian drama seem magnificent.  It isn't.  Worst of all, the script focuses on issues that are not at issue.  Friendship that turns to enmity and the relation of church to state are shop-worn topics with regard to Becket's martyrdom.  Neglected in BECKET is the achievement of Henry II who governed an empire stretching from Scotland to Spain with administrative skills so adroit that he is credited with founding English common law.  The fame of Thomas Becket like that of many of his contemporaries derives from his having become the feckless enemy of a gifted leader.",1408579200,3,924,4.878205128205129
225169,4,6300198731,"I love this movie because of its inspiring qualities, although I can only give it four stars because of its seeming lack of faithful historicity.  I am in the process of checking all the source material for the events and characters portrayed.

It is undeniably true that a man called Becket, a wealthy man even before becoming a friend and servant of Henry II, was made archbishop (after being Chancellor) and that this effected a transformation.  The play /  film seems to fall short in being an unquestioning eulogy of one character (Thomas a Becket) and largely a mischaracterisation of Henry of Anjou (Henry II of England) who was very learned in his own right, not a relatively slow-witted, awestruck admirer of Becket.

 Henry was known for a number of striking virtues: he was very honest and straightforward, was known to always keep his word, was a man of considerable compassion, a man ""without pride"" as one of his contemporaries designated him, and tireless in his judicial and administrative duties.  He was abstemious, and careless in his dress, generous to the poor, though a man of moderate personal expenditures.  In the film he comes across as unlearned and almost stupid,with nothing to do but carouse and play politics, and to be offended rather easily.  I find it hard to believe that he was responsible for the death of the imaginary beloved of Thomas Becket; I believe that was one of the fictions invented for the movie.",1408492800,,1445,4.841463414634147

A film adaptation of the play Becket or the Honour of God by Jean Anouilh that starts light hearted but becomes much more indeed. I had never heard the story before, and so it was all new and refreshing to me. A heart breaking story of love, but not in the traditional way that we think of it. Two men, King Henry II & Thomas Becket two friends......I felt for each character and that is what makes the acting in this classic so great. I tip my hat to both O'Toole & Burton! One that will definitely be added to my blu-ray collection!

7/3/14 Update: I watched the Blu-ray version of this restored film I just bought, truly beautiful, you really get to to see the details of the sets, wardrobe, and even actual sweat from the actors! The sound quality of the soundtrack is top notch. What an amazing story that was brought to life by two strong leading men Peter O'Toole & Richard Burton. I was really looking forward to getting this when I saw that Peter O'Toole had done an audio commentary. After watching this film for the first time last month I was certain that I had picked up on the little nuances of the story. Peter O'Toole's commentary let me know that I had indeed pick up on a lot of the cues read by the actors or looks given. I also learned so much more into how Mr. O'Toole works and how he goes about putting that into action. It was great to hear his perspective on scenes, and learn things that I had not picked up on, or even just behind the scene anecdotes. My only complaint is also about the audio commentary that was moderated by Mark Kermode....for the most part his leading questions were great, but that said there were times when he would cut Mr. O'Toole off, or start talking when Mr. O'Toole was clearly trying to enjoy a particular scene. Now it could have just been me, but I just wanted him to shut up at certain points. Here I am trying to listen to one of the greatest actors of his time, talking about an amazing piece of film he worked on, and he dares to interrupt him, shame! If you are going to buy this film I would most certainly go for the Blu-ray....not only for the great film restoration but the price alone is worth Peter O'Toole's commentary!",1404086400,2,2299,4.3217592592592595

Yet I continued, on until his death earlier this year. At which point I did the inevitable reconsideration. And now I realize that Sean Connery could act 1000 rings around O'Toole with his eyes shut and both legs tied around his neck. O'Toole possibly made four or five really decent films, and this was one of them. Most of those were carried off by superior actors--The Lion in Winter sticks out in my memory--but Beckett is another example, not so much of a superior actor but of another case where O'Toole acted as usual, screaming his head off instead of acting, and letting his co-star act off of that. Surprising how often that worked and how often he was applauded for it. Lawrence was the one successful role where he didn't do it that much.

Thomas Becket and Henry II, King of England are best friends. They do everything together, drinking, womanizing, hunting, etc.) Thomas has a sharp and sly wit the king admires. Whatever the situation, he always gives Henry something to ponder. Henry sees something in Thomas that's sorely missing in the rest of his suck-ups so he appoints him as Lord Chancellor.

Yet, in spite of Thomas' immoral lifestyle, he has a clean conscience. Although he is the king's sidekick, he hates to see his Saxon race oppressed by the Norman nobility. He also hates needless war and bloodshed. When he and Henry are out hunting they barge into a hut and find an old man and his daughter. Henry wants to take the girl as a concubine but Thomas desperately tries to save her by begging the king to give her to him instead. The king agrees. Thomas tells the father to take heart--he will send her home as soon as possible, undefiled.

Henry is so pleased with Thomas' accomplishments that when the old Archbishop of Canterbury dies, he appoints Thomas to take his place. Thomas reluctantly agrees but gives Henry a fair warning--there may come a day when Henry will regret his decision. Thomas becomes serious about his new commitment to God and the church and Henry is furious because he can no longer use him as a mindless puppet. I won't spoil the story anymore. If you've read your history you know what happens in the end.

I wish Becket had won the major academy awards of 1964 (Picture, Director and Leading Actor) instead of My Fair Lady because it put a bigger impression on me. MFL has its fans (and I don't look down on them because quality is subjective) but Ive never one of them. The outside scenes are clearly not outside, none of the songs besides I could have danced all night really grab me, the movie goes on and on, Rex Harrison starts out all right as the cynical smart-alleck speech therapist but gets supremely annoying after two and a half hours of ceaseless monologues and Audrey Hepburns two note performance grates on my nerves because it lacks subtlety and shadingshe is either black or white, street vendor or refined, educated accomplished ladyits like a light switch turned on and off.

In Becket, the costumes and sets look more gritty and realistic (those church scenes were absolutely breathtaking) the cinematography is drop dead gorgeous (rich shades of sepia, brown, gray and green) the screenplay is constantly crackling with wit and rolls off the tongue like poetry, the two leads play off each other perfectly and the supporting cast adds some fine color.
Awards are often given due to mood swings of the public and the judges so I suppose My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins won eight and five (whereas Becket only won one) was because this was the year right after the great American tragedy of 1963 (I think you know what I'm referring to) so the judges preferred giving more honors to more cheerful, up-beat, escapism movies.

Richard Burton gives a magnificent, low-key but never wooden performance as the stoic Thomas who gradually transforms from a libertine to a saint. His rich creamy voice is always a pleasure to the ears. Every sentence he utters sounds like it should be etched in marble. Peter O'Toole is also brilliant in a more showy turn as the hysterical, woman-crazed, psychologically teetering Henry. His hammy style is a perfect 180 degree opposite to Burton's more cerebral character.

Probably their finest moments are:

1. When Henry asks Gwendolyn (Thomas' mistress) to play for him and Thomas. He sits next to her while Thomas stands from a distance with a rather cross expression on his face. ""You know what Thomas?"" says Henry ""Sometimes I think we are the only two civilized men in England and you've made me into a man of the most delicate sensibilities. Now, if you truly love me, you should find me (puts his arms around her and gets a truly diabolical, wolfish and savage look on his face) a beautiful and well-bred girl to give me a little polish.""

2. When Henry announces his plans to make Thomas the next Archbishop. Thomas looks Henry straight in the face and says with a cold, dead serious tone ""I beg of you--DO NOT DO THIS.""
3. Thomas' prayer in the middle of the film when he is an archbishop while Brother John is listening in. The urgent, serious look on his face says it all.
4. Right before the excommunication scene. ""Gentlemen, it is a supreme irony that the worldly Becket---the profligate and libertine--should find himself standing here at this moment. Yet here he is, in spite of himself. But the king for good or ill passed the burden of the church onto me and now I must carry it. I've rolled up my sleeves and taken the church on my back. Nothing will ever make me set it down.""
5. Henry contorting his face, gagging, trembling and groveling on the floor at the climatic dinner scene a la Gollum with the elven rope around his neck in The Lord of the Rings. That part was so hard to watch. I know Henry is a bad bad man but at that moment, I felt so sorry for him because he asked his barons if anyone would rid him of `that meddlesome priest' and little does he know he'll have to live with that for the rest of his life. It takes an extremely talented actor to make the audience feel sorry for an unlikeable character and Peter O'Toole NAILED that.
6. The end of the film when Thomas is performing his last church service. Brother Phillip informs him that some soldiers are banging on the doors. Thomas says to open them. ""I've never heard of bolting the doors during vespers. Everything must done as was prepared."" The look on his face and the resonance in his voice says it all--he knows his time has come.

It doesn't surprise me why neither Richard Burton nor Peter O'Toole won the academy award for best leading actor. They both deserved it and it would have been a crime to award one and ignore the other so the judges decided to just cancel them out.

The rest of the cast delivers on all levels. Donald Wolfit as Folliot, the bishop who compromises everything to save his skin, Pamela Brown, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the sad, bitter queen of England who tries to resist the evil nature of her husband, John Gielgud as the smooth-talking King Louie of France, David Weston as Brother John, a monk who starts out as an enemy of Thomas but later on becomes his closest friend when Henry casts him off, Sian Phillips, (who looks and sounds quite a bit like Cate Blanchett) the beautiful Gwendolyn who's love for Thomas was doomed from the start etc.)

Peter Glenville's stagey direction is superb. He brings out the best in every actor and glides smoothly from setting to setting. Probably his best moments were:

1.) The noisy, drunken, savage court of Henry. One of the barons throws a handful of food at another. The other baron grabs his prong and sticks him in the rump. They both get into a big fight on the dinner table. Thomas stops them and then retires to get away from the noise and confusion. He goes upstairs where it is very quiet, serene and peaceful. You can feel the 'shift.' Gwendolyn is singing and playing the lute. He complements her, throws himself on the bed and mutters ""Noisy brutes.""

2.) The eeriness and dramatic flourish of the excommunication and murder scenes. There is plenty of suspense and fear leading up to the climaxes.

Laurence Rosenthal gives a radiant, regal and majestic score that contains plainchant melodies and plenty of rich, warm orchestrations. Probably the finest highlights were Gwendolyn's theme and the hunting party.

The only nitpicks I have are:

1. The scene with the French prostitute could have been cut out. We already know the king is a rake from the beginning flashback scenes with the two peasant girls and when he demands Thomas give up Gwendolyn. We don't need to beat over the head with it.

2. The monks in a cluster when Thomas is killed. It puzzles me that they didn't try to overwhelm and stop the barons because there were only four barons and about twenty monks. Only Brother John has the guts to give his all in all for his master.

However these are just little nitpicks in a otherwise, five star movie. Highly recommended. Good for discussions.",1396137600,,8678,4.752159468438538

225250,4,6300198731,"Becket tells the story of St. Thomas Becket and King Henry II of England. Becket, at the beginning of the story, is a close friend of the king, though they are more like drinking/wenching/carousing buddies than lordly nobility. To be sure, the king does the work of running the kingdom, which includes reclaiming some of Normandy from French rule. Henry is the great grandson of William the Conqueror, who united England under Norman rule in the late 1000s. Becket, by contrast, is a Saxon, one of the conquered people. He has risen up to a level of influence by his quick wits and his few scruples. He has not found an honor worth fighting for and so lives a profligate life. The king admires his intelligence quite a bit and decides to make him Chancellor of England. Becket accepts the role and aids in both raising money for the French campaign and conquering Normandy with as little bloodshed as possible.

Part of raising money is collecting taxes from church properties. When the king consults the bishops, they refuse to pay based on exemptions from William the Conqueror. The king is adamant and Becket, seeing the power play between them, argues for the king. Becket and the king realize that the church is a significant power in England and could be a threat to royal authority. As they fight in France, word comes that the archbishop of Canterbury, the highest prelate in England, has died. The king sees his opportunity to control the church. He makes Becket the new archbishop. Becket is quite reluctant but obeys the king. After becoming archbishop, Becket discovers the honor that he has been lacking and defends the rights of the church against the king. Best friends become intense rivals.

The movie is a fascinating portrayal of the two characters, though clearly Peter O'Toole, who plays the king, delivers the more dynamic performance. Richard Burton plays Becket as a clever but reserved fellow. His transition from profligate playboy to stalwart defender of the church is believable, but his performance is a bit too austere and solemn. Some of the ceremonial scenes, like when Becket is ordained, take longer than modern audiences would be patient for. The production values are very high. The story is the best part.

The two seem type cast as the two fast friends, with Peter O'Toole as the ebullient, imperious, youthful King Henry II, who misreads his much older, more mature, more whimsical companion completely, when he makes Burton's Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury.  The cast is a who's who of great British stage actors of the period, including Donald Wolfit, John Gielgud, Martita Hunt, and Pamela Brown. Produced by the legendary Hal Wallis and directed by England's foremost stage director of the period, Peter Glenville, the movie won an Oscar for Best adapted screenplay from the Jean Anouilh Broadway hit of the same name. This is, for stage lovers, top drawer work from among two of the finest directors, and playwrights of that generation. But the bravura performances of the leading men dominates the film, and, for that alone, it's worth watching. Amazingly, this picture seems to have escaped the signs of the time it which it was made. The costumes and scenery are quite arresting, and the ritual of excommunication is in sound and sight just plain riveting. If you are looking for a film with wonderful dialogue and actors who can give its interpretation its due, if you are in the mood for watching friendship treated seriously as one of the four loves, and if you don't require modern digital tricks an intrusive music and sound effects, you might give it a try.

Traces the conflict between Henry II and Bucket, how Henry's adoration of Beckett turned to hatred because Becket as he mentions in one part of the film loves god more than the king.
Some of the speeches by Henry point to a certain unrequited homosexual infatuation for Becket though Henry (and Beckett in his youth) also are seen here as having a great lust and passion for beautiful women.

Spoiled though by the great error of describing Beckett as a Saxon when he was in reality of Norman nobility. I am totally unsure of why the scriptwriters included this in what a previous reviewer correctly referred to as a 'historic howler'

225426,3,6300198731,"Do you need a spoiler alert for an historical drama where the outcome is already known? Well, just in case:
SPOILER ALERT

I had long looked forward to watching ""Becket."" It did not commit the unforgivable sin of being boring. There were things I liked about it. But I cannot say I liked it. So three stars.

The movie goes over the long friendship between English King Henry II and Thomas Becket. They carouse and chase women through the countryside. Henry names the pragmatic, strategic, loyal and apparently secular Becket as his Chancellor. Hoping to have more control over the enormously powerful Catholic church, Henry gets Becket ordained and appoints him as Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Church in England. To Henry's chagrin, instead of docilely complying with Henry's wishes, Becket truly gets religion, gives all his worldly goods to the poor, and insists on the primacy of the Church in church-related matters. Henry, enraged at Becket's betrayals, asks his barons, ""Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" The barons assassinate Becket on the altar of Canterbury Cathedral. The contrite Henry submits himself to flogging, then exits the cathedral and announces that he has asked the Pope to venerate Becket as a saint.

Do NOT watch Becket looking for accurate history. While historical records from the 12th century are not entirely consistent, the movie is based on a French play authored by a man who acknowledged the inaccuracies but decided that correcting them would undermine his themes. In the movie, Becket represents the Saxon people in England, who are said to have been oppressed by the Normans (including Henry II) since the invasion of William the Conqueror. Becket was in reality Norman. Henry II is portrayed as a crude, perpetually petulant, drunken, irresponsible adolescent, when in fact he was a powerful, competent --if sometimes mercurial-- ruler of a vast realm, unusually well-read for his time, whose reforms underlay the English common law as we know it today. The movie suggests that Henry's frustration at his thwarted homosexual love for Becket inflamed his feelings of resentment at Becket's betrayals--really? Do tell! And the movie portrays Henry's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, as an empty-headed harridan, when in fact she was one of the most accomplished, powerful women of her day.

I can't recall another movie in which women come off as badly as they do in ""Becket."" Henry's highly accomplished mother (Empress Matilda) and wife are reduced to unattractive whining nags. Other female characters are whores. Henry rants and rages about how much he hates women.

Those things being said, ""Becket"" still manages to be a well-made, entertaining film. The director carried over from the English-language performance of the play and manages to open out the movie from the stage quite effectively. You'll find plenty of sharp dialogue, lively camera work, reasonably brisk pacing, and impressive sets and costumes. Peter O'Toole, playing Henry II VERY differently than in the later ""The Lion in Winter,"" gives a vibrant, unreserved performance as the obnoxious king. I have to see a better Richard Burton movie though. It's partly Becket's reserved character, but as with other movies I've seen him in, Burton seems slightly uncomfortable on screen, as though his underwear were a couple of sizes too small. I know his performance in ""Becket"" was widely admired, but I didn't love it.

It's a historical drama of the friendship of commoner Thomas Becket and King Henry II, who promoted Becket to Archbishop of Canterbury, and the tragic end of that friendship.  I'm not at all sure of how far the film may have strayed from factual events; however, from checking other resources, it's probably not too far.

Having trouble with the Catholic Church, he makes Beckett the Archbishop of Canterbury, fully expecting that Beckett will abide by his wishes and will be his ""puppet.""  However, Beckett takes his job as Archbishop very seriously and becomes religious and serious about the post.

 Henry is furious, and Beckett leaves for Rome and is in exile for years.  When he returns, with Henry's permission, he continues his devotion to his office and the Church, further infuriating Henry.

225628,5,6300198731,"Richard Burton is Becket, a Saxon and close friend of the king. Peter O'Toole is Henry the Second, Norman King of England some 100 years after the Conqueror. The Saxons still hate and distrust the Normans, and name as traitor anyone who does not also hate them. But Becket, always the brilliant strategist and subtle, very subtle, has been drinking and wenching with Henry since they were youngsters. Henry openly confesses that he loves Thomas, while Thomas is equally blunt about the fact that he cannot love. In fact, the one time he comes close to it, a Welsh princess of great beauty who was captured in the conquest of her father's kingdom, he contrives to give her over to the king.

Henry uses this hated Saxon as a tool against the Norman nobles who plot by the very nature of their position, and against the Church, which has various privileges, including being tax exempt. (Some things never change, eh?) So when the old Archbishop of Canterbury dies, Henry appoints the one man he believes he can trust to replace him: Thomas Becket. Becket protests that he is not a priest, but Henry points out that he has already been appointed an archdeacon. He can be ordained one day and be consecrated a bishop the next. And so it is done.

What Henry had not anticipated was that Becket would take his position seriously. Just before his ordination, he prays before a crucifix, addressing Christ directly: ""Lord, are you sure you're not laughing at me?""

One important privilege enjoyed by the Church was that if a priest was accused of a crime, he was not given over to the civil authorities, but rather to the church, which was responsible for determining his guilt and punishment. Henry declares that this privilege must end, and orders a priest accused of rape to be handed over to the civil authorities. Becket sees this as against the church's authority, and uses the one really serious weapon he has: he excommunicates the civil magistrate.

I think the whole thing is pretty historical, so I feel free to leave out a lot of plot details. One line, I believe, is directly a historical quote. When Henry is sufficiently vexed by Becket preferring God over him, and by the use of the power of excommunication, he is getting drunk with several of his noble companions. He shouts the immortal line, ""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"" And so they do. They go to the cathedral and murder Becket.

One other major talent is involved in this movie, and gets too little exposure. Sir John Gielgud plays King Louis of France. He's very, very smooth.",1336780800,,2562,4.684444444444445
225629,5,6300198731,"Like all old films, first released on DVD a few years ago and now re-released on blu-ray, the key question is, how good is the high definition transfer? In this case, the transfer is good, with excellent colours, good sharpness but a somewhat grainy image, possibly due to the film's age. The sound is good for its time.

The film, based on the murder of Thomas Beckett in Canterbury cathedral, is very well presented, well acted and well directed. It is moving, touching, but completely lacking in any serious romance, as one would expect from such a political and religious tale. It is the story of two close friends, whose friendship goes sour, when Beckett does not obey his King in every wish of his. An excellent film, definitely worth acquiring.",1332115200,3,752,4.740458015267175
225630,4,6300198731,"Becket is a heavily fictionalized retelling of Henry II's relationship with his best friend Thomas Becket. Behind the personal relationship is the struggle for supremacy between the church and the crown in twelfth century England. The acting is extraordinary, as it should be in a film that stars Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.

As a historian, I find the foppish portrayal of Henry II a bit off putting (hence the four stars). But if you accept the portrayal as incredibly ahistorical, well then prepare yourself for a very well executed film.

There is an interesting argument in the film  over the origins of the Anglican (or perhaps Anglo-Saxon?) Church. The film firmly re-positions the origins of the English Reformation, usually placed in the sixteenth century with Henry VIII, in the twelfth century. It also argues that this movement did not originate with the king, but rather stemmed from the Saxon people. It is an interesting, although highly inaccurate, argument.

Overall this is an excellent movie, well worth watching.",1327536000,2,1038,5.160714285714286
225631,5,6300198731,Received in good order in very short period of time.  I'm impressed with the quick service for this old film.,1324252800,,109,4.45
225632,5,6300198731,"In examining various lists of the greatest religious films ever made, ""Beckett"" is one film that inevitably appears - and with good reason. While it would be easy to think of ""Beckett"" as being a great film because it was nominated for 12 Oscars, I measure its greatness in terms of its acting, the writing, its historical element, and its themes of true religion and friendship.

First, the acting. Both Richard Burton (Beckett) and Peter O'Toole (King Henry II) received Oscar nominations for their roles, and both deserved it. Having either of these great actors in his prime would be a treat, but having both together is something special. While I detest the selfish and self-destructive Henry II that O'Toole portrays, O'Toole makes Henry an intriguing, comical, and tragic figure for the viewer. Burton's Beckett, on the other hand, ends up being someone who is not just crafty as at the beginning of the movie but also courageous and substantial in the end.

The writing is also excellent. The movie actually won the Oscar for Best Screenplay, and it's not surprising. ""Becket"" is based on the play by French playwright Jean Anouilh and was adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt. ""Beckett"" was actually Anhalt's second Oscar for Best Screenplay. The film manages to hold the viewer's interest, despite the length of the film (148 minutes): my two teenaged children were engaged throughout. Anouilh and Anhalt manage to make Henry and Beckett walk out of the history pages and become living characters. ""Beckett"" is also filled with a lot of memorable dialogue. Not the noblest words ever spoken by a husband, but certainly some of the most memorable are those spoken by Henry to his wife: ""Your body, madam, was a desert that duty forced me to wander in alone. But you have never been a wife to me!"" While my son's favorite quote was Henry's ""I haven't bathed for a long time and I stink,"" the most famous is `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?""

Which brings me to the historical element. While ""Beckett,"" naturally takes liberties with history, the essence of the story is true. My wife and oldest daughter both like historical fiction, and ""Beckett"" is fine historical fiction. The movie gives you a sense not only of the conflict between Saxons and Normans in 12th century England but also of the centuries-long struggle between church and state in Europe.

But what makes the historical element especially rich is the film's religious dimension. ""Beckett"" is not only a historical film but also a religious one. I don't mean that it merely deals ""with"" religion but that it also illuminates some of the features of true Christianity. Dramatically, it's good writing to have Beckett undergo a transformation from sinner to saint when he's consecrated archbishop. Historically, it's a fact. But religiously, it's true. ""Beckett"" is a powerful portrayal of the grace of God in a man's life, yet it accomplishes this without ever becoming ""preachy."" The same grace that Beckett received and which made him able to forsake all for the sake of God and His honor is the grace which Henry steadfastly refuses to accept. Beckett's religious courage is an inspiring example to me and my children.

Finally, Beckett is about friendship. While Beckett and Henry's friendship begins with drinking and whoring, it's a much deeper friendship than that. In fact, it appears that Beckett is the only friend Henry ever had. The fact that Beckett ultimately chose God over Henry is not only a threat to his kingship but, perhaps more importantly to the cinematic Henry, a threat to his friendship. For while Henry hates Beckett, he also loves him.

""Beckett"" is a masterpiece on many levels. I highly recommend it!",1321920000,4,3720,4.915605095541402

225687,5,6300198731,"This 1964 film is almost three hours long.  I'm glad I watched it slowly because there is so much to it that I needed time to understand it completely.  It is a compelling tale, one that is based on the reign of King Henry the 2nd from 1154 to 1189.  Brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole, he is a Norman King.  But his best friend, Becket, played by Richard Burton, is a Saxon.  The two men are a high-energy rowdy pair, given to drinking, womanizing and high adventure.

But things change when the King promotes Becket to the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Becket now gets religious and conflicts arise between him and the King.  There's a lot of pomp and ceremony and insights into how the disruption of the friendship impacts both England, the Church and the two men.

I found this all fascinating and applaud the stellar performances of all concerned.  This is a worthwhile film that has stood the test of time and it certainly is worth watching.",1312243200,,957,4.543859649122807
225688,5,6300198731,"Becket is an excellent movie: one of my favorites and one of the handful I have bothered to watch multiple times.  It is both an excellent play and an excellent production with great acting, editing, sets, costumes.  The only real detraction is the music, which doesn't get a pass, even taking into account the era of film-making.  Read the reviews by Mike Powers and David Goldberg.

All I really have to add is that the film does a remarkably good and honest job of dealing with a struggling religious faith, showing it as a subtle force that can exist both sincerely and insincerely at the same time and can work through an aesthete as well as a pulpet thumper.  Likewise, while the film may not be entirely historically accurate, I believe it avoids anachronism in showing the men of the Middle Ages to be a mix of the worldy and spiritual without descending into condescension or hagiography.

Again, a great film that deserves a re-make, although there are no actors today who would not embarass themselves by taking on these roles of Burton and O'Toole.",1310342400,2,1060,4.702702702702703

The United States pretends to honor a separation of Church and State, but how do we act on-the-ground, much less within our foreign policy?
Another twist in this story suggests Henry II (Peter O'Toole) moves beyond ""perennial adolescent"" toward the end of the melodrama to become quite deliciously deranged.

225692,5,6300198731,"First and foremost, this is a play, and a very impressive work by arguably France's greatest playwright of the latter half of the 20th Century, although one would never guess this from the rarity with which his plays are nowadays presented. Unfortunately, death did his reputation no good at all. It is packed with words and ideas articulating history, poetry, political and theological philosophy. The dialogue is beautifully crafted, and it emerges from the mouths of two of Britain's finest actors with all the wit, tension, pathos and grandeur that one associates with those thespians who have reached the very pinnacle of their profession. Anger, sadism, sexual excess and the lowest manifestations of the human animal abound, and they flood the screen at a breath-taking intensity. But the most profound moments are those where stillness and silence prevail, allowing the viewers to assimilate and evaluate the chess-like moves between the two powerful protagonists: O'Toole as the coarse and brutish Henry ll, Burton as the calculating, controlled but ultimately civilized Beckett. It is Ali v Fraser, the Thrilla in Manilla transposed to the Sussex Downs. A bruising bleeding contest fought with minds and tongues that goes right down to the wire.

It is well to recall that the characters are historical, but not straight out of history. As with George Bernard Shaw, they have been created from history to mouth the ideas of the dramatist rather than to present an impeccable account of history itself. This applies to all the other personna that populate these tableaux. The downtrodden Saxon peasants; the over-arching Norman barons;the Bishop of London (Donald Wolfit); Louis the Umpteenth,King of France (John Gielgud); all are splendid mouthpieces ( and sometimes also codpieces ) for the plot and the action but most of all for the dialectic arguments that underpin this whole production and give it a timeless dimension. Not exactly men for all seasons, but instruments of power for all time. And what Tableaux! The camera does a wonderful job of framing the characters and their actions in unfogetable images and calling us back from the language of the 20th Century into the squalor beauty, majesty and ugliness of the 12th. Peter Glenville. the director, could have been fogiven if an element of tedium had permeated the onward flow of the film as dialogue of this high quality cannot be rushed, but his penchant for speeding up the camera following each dramatic episode and cutting cleanly from each scene to the next maintains a momentum that never allows the story to drag or the interest to falter. In short, this must stand as one of the most memorable and compelling historical dramas ever brought to the silver screen, and it enshrines two of the greatest male performances in the pantheon of the cinema.

Technically, the sound and visual qualities are superb, especially given the age of the original. Only the extras disappoint. The musical score is faux Vaughan Willams and does not deserve half-an-hour of critical commentary.

(The exceptions are places where enhanced clarity makes film tricks like matte paintings more obvious. I still prefer the hi-def image without reservation.)

I tend to imagine Peter O'Toole as too big a star to give his attention to DVD commentary tracks, but he does a commentary track here and is fully engaged, interesting and informative.

The Blu-ray supplements are missing two archival interviews with Richard Burton that appear on the DVD. (The interviews are interesting, but there is no mention of Becket in either of them.)",1255219200,6,765,4.9147286821705425

Becket is a movie for all times and the performances of these two fine actors are just EVERGREEN.

Then it seemed, before one could take a breath, out it came on Blu-ray.  Since this is probably my favorite of all films, at least in this genre, I immediately ordered it.  The beautiful rendering of sight and sound of this film brought tears to my eyes.  I had difficulty believing that this forty-five year old movie could have been brought to this level of excellence.  MPI must be given great credit for caring so much for this film.

The cast for this film is essentially a who's who of British acting excellence, many, of course, whom are no longer with us.  Peter O'Toole's achievement in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" notwithstanding, his performance in ""Becket"" is, for me, his tour de force -- the epitome of screen acting.  I think the most moving moment in the entire film is the final scene when he is looking down at the image of Becket on his sarcophagus, following his final lines: ""Is the honor of God washed clean enough?  Are you satisfied now, Thomas?"" His face then, within a few seconds, conveys a series of expressions that I have difficulty describing -- from gladness (that Becket has now been finally canonized a saint) to grief (that the man he admired and loved is gone).  But it was done with such subtlety!  How O'Toole could have accomplished such a thing with a camera grinding a few feet away from him is something I can't fathom.  But it is terribly moving.

Only a few years ago we couldn't have dreamt of having something like this disc sitting on a shelf ready to bring this and other classic films to life again whenever we wish it.  If MGM still has the rights to ""The Lion in Winter"" it would be wonderful to  see a similar restoration of that classic.",1253923200,4,1881,4.507374631268436

Shot almost as a play -- though there are good location scenes -- it came across as overly dialogue-driven ... again, great theater but not-so-great cinema.  Also, and unfortunately, the acting now seems over-the-top almost to the point of over-wrought hysteria, and this in more than a few places.

I recommend this film heartily to anyone who loves history, loves the medieval period, enjoy Burton and O'Toole at their brio-filled best, loves castles with burning torches mounted on the walls. I first saw the movie in the '60s, saw it again in the '70s, lost track of it, and came upon the new DVD recently. For my money, the film has aged very well. It's essentially timeless. Historical accuracy be damned - this movie captures the romance of history, the myth of history, the wonderful pleasure of history, and isn't unduly worried about strictly hewing to actual events. Several of the scenes rank among the finest ever filmed - I think especially of Becket and Henry on the beach, and the death scene. At times the picture is a bit talky; these times are brief. John Geilgud is very fine - I remembered his sequence as boring, but seen now, it works beautifully. Burton is perfect. O'Toole is riveting - a spectacular combination of gorgeous majesty and odd subterranean faultlines. I hesitate to call the movie a masterpiece - it's not quite that - but it's certainly worthy of four stars.",1246492800,,1174,4.703883495145631

Listening to the commentary, it turns out that play was based on two ""famous"" feuding men in British theatre who turned the theatre upside down with their feud.  The Becket story is not followed with historical accuracy. Becket was not Saxon but a Norman like the king.  O'Toole laughs because he says that in schools around the country, teachers are trying to teach the story of Becket and point out the inaccuracies without realizing that the story isn't very accurate at all.

Besides that, the movie offers an interesting and entertaining episode of the conflict between religion (and its associated morality) and politics that could easily be extended to our current times.

225962,4,6300198731,"This magnificent film captures some of the best acting performances ever seen by O'Toole and Burton and weaves a satisfyingly complex storyline with intersecting ideas, philosophies, and spiritual struggles. I grew up watching Becket on telvision (pan and scan) and so watching it widescreen on this (VC-1) Blu-ray Disc is a revelation. However, I'm sorely disappointed that a very late-generation print seems to have been used for the transfer: either that or the best available material representative of the director's vision is somewhat drab in color and disappointingly soft in focus. Indeed, I have DVDs that seem to capture more fine detail than what I see here, though the compression is first-rate so the image is far more ""natural"" than what DVD can convey. However, I suspect that the real negatives or first-generation IP elements appear much sharper and more detailed than what we see here.

The audio is an odd mix, a very mono-sounding ""PCM"" 2.0 lossless track which despite being lossless sounds very thin and conjested, and a nice 5.1 Dolby Digital mix that sadly wasn't optimized by a lossless TrueHD presentation. The mixes are entirely different, and I suspect that the 5.1 DD mix is mastered from the 70mm multichannel mix while the 2.0 PCM is mastered from the mono track. I wish MPI had presented the multi channel mix losslessly as well, as it's clearly the superior mix and would have been nice to have had in full quality.

I have yet to check out the bonus features but suspect that they are well worth the time to investigate.",1230595200,,1554,4.904942965779468
225963,5,6300198731,"I am reminded, amid viewing the solemnity of this epic that one should never go to the movies for a history lesson.
  We begin our story in the early 1170s where a procession of monks and crowds of commoners wait outside Canterbury Cathedral for the arrival of King Henry II (Peter O'Toole)to do penance at the tomb of the slain Archbishop, Thomas Becket (a classically charismatic Richard Burton, very much in his element). Dismounting from his horse, he bestrides the steps of the Cathedral, enters, and approaches the tomb with his two attendants in tow, garbed in a red cape and a simple shift( As red is the color of Catholic martyrdom, the color of the cloak evokes some speculation). Soon, both cloak and shift are removed as the king hunches down for penance, and begins a wistful reminiscence about a tragic path from friendship to enmity.
  Laurence Rosenthal's score captures the early years of the tempestuous duo as a glorious romp through the English countryside, barely escaping by dawn's early light after a tryst with a farmer's daughter (Linda Marlowe), and whereas actual accounts of Becket's life state that he was celebate and abstainant from vice, this version of his life has him arranging more than one such encounter  with the opposite sex ( and joining him in these escapades) when he isn't running Henry's court.
 Interestingly, Jean Anouilh's play-turned-film ignores the fact of the main character's having been of Norman extraction, and makes him a Saxon.
  The real-life camaraderie of the two lead actors comes across very well in the early scenes. The acting becomes more profound with the change in the relationship of their characters.
  The constant debate between the justice by the state and justice by the church comes into focus. Becket becomes the King's Chancellor, much to the dismay of the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury (Felix Aylmer), who prefers to uphold canon law as the supreme law of England  over the power of the King.
 A girl the two friends encounter while hunting (Jennifer Hilary) becomes a point of interest for both of them, indirectly leading to a tragedy involving Becket's dour wife, Gwendolen (O'Toole's then-real-life wife, Sian Phillips), and we see the initial rift between the two men.
 However, they still undertake their diplomatic mission to France and the newly widowered Becket scarcely has time to grieve. He arranges for a French town's capitulation, reporting to the Barons who strongly influence the King, has an initially hazardous encounter with a monk(David Weston) in whom he will find something of a kindred spirit, and confers with Henry in the company of his temporary French acquisition (Veronique Vendell). Soon  both learn of the demise of the old Archbishop of Canterbury, and on a whim, Henry decides to give Thomas his position.
  The rift between the two men becomes official when Thomas begins to take the position seriously, expressing the desire to uphold canon law over  the rule of the King, particularly regarding the issue of a nobleman, who seized an ordered the killing of a priest accused of improper conduct with a young girl before the accused could be brought to trial in ecclesiastical court. This nobleman, Lord Gilbert, one of the King's most loyal supporters, remains unrepentant, and Thomas excommunicates him.
 In  real life, the terms of the Constitution of Clarendon, which further fueled the struggle between monarchical and Papal power were another factor dividing the two former friends.
 As King Louis VII of France, Cardinal Zambelli, Pope Alexander III, and Bishop Folliot,John Gielgud, Gino Cervi, Paolo Stoppa, and Donald Wolfit are the other lead supporting players.
 Martita Hunt, Pamela Brown, and Riggs O'Hara, as Empress Matilda, Eleanor of Aquataine, and Prince Henry compose the family with whom ( at least in this production) the King has much strife.
 As would be the case with another King Henry (VIII) and another Saint Thomas(More) nearly 400 years later,  the issue of the power of the Church vs the power of the King becomes a death struggle between two former friends.
  Despite its inaccuracies, ""Becket"" has a stellar cast, and those viewing it will be entertained by a well-acted and thoroughly absorbing drama.",1229817600,2,4250,5.07183908045977

For the person who does not know a great deal of history I believe they will be surprised to discover that a King of England would submit to being thrashed by a bunch of monks in penance for anything, including the murder of a priest.  Certainly the fact that the primary characters are based on real people might spark an interest, at least to go read a survey of the central characters' biographies.  Hollywood can do useful work in this regard in a culture where significant percentages of people cannot answer basic questions of historical fact.  The acting and the story line are compelling and the casting is superb.

On the other side of the house, Henry II is depicted as being far too shallow and weak.  His angst is much more modern than actual and, then, Becket's transformation is depicted as far more spiritual than are the facts.  Becket never stopped being a politician though I believe that he certainly did undergo a fairly extensive ""rebirth"" upon entering the priesthood.  Those things can be forgiven but allow only a four star recommendation.

There is so much to enjoy in this movie, but for me, two bits of dialog stand out.  In the first, King Henry finally realizes that Becket is no longer ""his Chancellor"" or ""his man.""  The brooding Henry's words cannot help but touch us:

Becket: forgive me (as he hands over chancellor's ring back to Henry)

Henry:  You give the Lions of England back to me; like a little boy who doesn't want to play any more.  I would have gone to war with all England's might being me -- and even against England's interest -- to defend you, Thomas.  I would have given away my life, laughingly, for you.  Only, I loved you, and you didn't love me... that's the difference.

Next is the near comic discussion between Henry and his wife:

Queen Matilda:  I gave you my youth... gave you your children.

Henry:  I don't LIKE my children.  And as for your youth... THAT withered flower, pressed between the pages of a hymnbook since you were 12 years old, with its watery blood and stale, incipid scent, you can bid farewell to that without a tear.  Your body was an empty desert, madam, which duty forced me to wander in alone...  And Becket was my friend... red-blooded, generous and full of strength, oh my Thomas...

There's so much more!

One day, I'm going to wash my face by breaking the ice covering the water.  As Thomas Becket always told his friend Henry to do.

226174,5,6300198731,"While watching this DVD presentation of Becket, I became nostalgic for that mid 60s-early 70s period when so many fine movies of this type were made (A Man for All Seasons, Becket, Anne of the Thousand Days, Cromwell, etc.).  It was a magical period because there were so many great adapted screenplays available and so many talented, serious British stage actors capable of bringing them to life.  Sir Alec Guiness, Sir John Gielgud, Richard Harris, Paul Scofield, Anthony Quayle, Robert Shaw, and other fine actors appeared in these movies, but none were more formidable than Sir Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole starring together.  Both were at the pinnacle of their acting careers in 1964.  Burton was only a year removed from his controversial turn as Marc Antony in the blockbuster Cleopatra and O'Toole had completed the epic Lawrence of Arabia a couple of years earlier.  The movie depicts the familiar story of a worldly and once-debauched Archbishop Thomas Becket, played by Burton, and his late, painful discovery that self-interest and hedonism couldn't compare to love and loyalty in the service of a higher cause.  Becket comes into dangerous conflict with his King, patron and former best friend, Henry II, played by O'Toole, when King Henry realizes too late that Becket is taking his job as Archbishop seriously.  The King, having cynically given the powerful position to his trusted friend, counts on him to be a willing accomplice to Henry's consolidation of royal power over the Church.  It is not to be, and both Henry and Becket are forced to make painful choices.  The movie is beautifully filmed in English castles, cathedrals and Shepperton Studios movie sets.  Becket is both a great piece of history and a wonderful lesson in character and devotion.",1209945600,2,1776,5.051369863013699

Burton hangs back -- as he should -- but his low key work is just as powerful.  The picture has been restored and looks and sounds terrific.

While O'Toole may look enfeebled these days, the sensational commentary shows he hasn't missed a step.

The story was told with as much historical accuracy as modern film would allow.

  Burton's excommunication of Lord Gilbert raised the hair on my neck.
The drama of that scene stands far above anything I've ever seen. It is a tribute to Burton that he underplayed his role so as not to overshadow that of O Toole, but in so doing, he really stole the movie.

226179,5,6300198731,"""Becket"" is a glorious movie and one which provides high interest in England's primeval past. Based upon a play by Jean Anouilh, the prime action centers around the power struggle between King Henry the II (played by Peter O'Toole) and Becket, who becomes The Archbishop of Canterbury (played by Richard Burton).  Set in the 1100s, we get a rare glimpse into that day and age. However, hatred is not at the center which propels this tale - but love.

Henry is base and crass, while Becket is learned and refined. They start off as best friends, roaming the countryside in search of more mayhem and debauchery, but soon fate and ego come in from stage left. To save an innocent girl from Henry's clutches, Becket innocently enters into a deal with the King. Little does he know it will cost him the only thing he loves in his life.

From this point on, the psychological underpinnings weave a treacherous web. Henry loves Becket, and probably knows he is not his equal, thus he begins a tireless campaign to use his royal advantage to make Becket feel the same way he does. But, Becket has a higher purpose and, unfortunately, the damage has been done.

Henry attempts to weaken the power of the Church of England by promoting Becket to Archbishop, thinking that by instilling an ally in that position he will have total control of England. But Becket, reluctant at first, takes the position in great earnest, and becomes a full-fledged man of God.

At this time, the church had the dominant say over many countries, and was a major force to be reckoned with. Henry wanted the right to put on trial religious clerics in civil court, but Becket held firm that it was the church's jurisdiction only. When Henry passes off a light sentence to a member of his court that murdered a clergyman, Becket uses the power of excommunication. This infuriates Henry and he fakes charges in order to prosecute Becket. Seeing the writing on the parchment, Becket flees to France and is given asylum by King Louis the VIIth (played brilliantly by Sir John Gielgud).

After meeting with the Pope, and arranging to come back to England, things never get set right with this debacle. In an off-the-cuff, exasperating declaration by Henry, Becket's sad fate is revealed.

In summation, ""Becket"" is an extraordinary visual experience. You can see the precision of acting excellence in both O'Toole and Burton. You will be riveted by the performance as they display the depth and range of each character; Henry's erratic and egotistical emotions balanced against Becket's single minded devotion. But, we wind up asking is it towards God, or himself? This is only a piece of the larger puzzle which you'll find in ""Becket"".

In closing, Jean Anouilh took some liberties with his play, and there are historical inaccuracies. However, this remains a stimulating character study in an absorbing time in England's history. It begs further investigation and it is well worth the effort. If anything, it proves that the complexity of human relationships remain just as strong now as it did almost 900 years ago. And with actors like these, it is well worth your time.
Highly Recommended!

226180,3,6300198731,"OK, I'll play devil's advocate here with a less than glowing opinion. I enjoyed watching this DVD, but the screenplay, based on the stage play, is truly dated and inaccurate in many respects. Like all human beings, Thomas Becket was flawed in many ways, among them in his arrogance and tactlessness. He invited his own murder, and it is puzzling that such a consummate diplomat would forget all of his considerable negotiation skills as archbishop. Filmmakers would repeat this mistake a few years later, with Thomas More, in A Man For All Seasons. The portrayal of Queen Eleanor is absurd - she was a powerful woman, many generations ahead of her time, not the shrew seen here. The same can be said of the character of Queen Matilda. While the production values, most notably the sets, though thoroughly 1960's, are quite good, the music is cloying and repetitive.

On the positive side, the performances of O'Toole and Burton, especially dealing with what they were given, are superb. And that's exactly what saves this production and makes watching it worthwhile.",1203897600,13,1066,4.955307262569832

That tension forms the backdrop for this film about an early English battle around the question. At least as depicted in the film this seemed an unlikely controversy between two dear friends Norman Henry II (played by a young Peter O'Toole) and his personal political advisor Saxon Thomas a Becket (played by Richard Burton). But that is the rub. Henry takes his kingship seriously, as he should at this point in history. Beckett does likewise as he grows into his role as Archbishop of Canterbury (when that job had real power). In the end one or the other had to win. With the benefit of hindsight and dressed in the full regalia of the Enlightenment I am glad that Henry won. But it was a near thing.

226300,5,6300198731,"Becket is one of those movies I'd heard about for years from people I trusted, yet never bothered to see.  Until today.

What a fine film.  Peter O'Toole has working for so long that it's easy to forget that he once cut a striking young figure.  And what an actor!  He's a rougish Henry II, a clever Norman who finds himself king of England in battle with the Church in the 12th century.  His right hand man (and best pal) is local turncoat Saxon Thomas Becket played by Richard Burton.  Beckett is somewhat expedient (in the worst sense of the word), clever and a good friend of the obnoxious-yet-entertaining king.  The two are bound by tomfoolery and Henry loves Beckett, trusts his counsel and makes him Chancellor of England in the face of opposition from both the barons and the Church.  Yet sometimes Thomas quietly intervenes on behalf of his countrymen.  Simultaneously as a member of Henry's court he seems to bear a sense of guilt.  ""Somehow I can never sport the idea of being loved.""

Becket is about honor, the honor of perhaps a previous age, but honor nonetheless.  Becket's surrender of his woman is terrible, but it comes from his understanding of honor.  And when Henry installs his friend Becket as Archbishop, it's with the understanding that Becket's expediency will inform his churchly function.  Little could have Henry predicted - in spite of the recognition that his friend was a bit enigmatic - that Becket would take his office seriously.  This is also a love story of a sort; the love of a king for his friend, the love of a new believer for an ideal, the sweetness and bitterness of loneliness.  The scenes in which Becket submits himself to God and Henry submits to the loss of his friend are exquisite.  If ""God"" is not your thing, substitute ""wisdom,"" ""truth,"" or ""enlightenment"" and take Becket's prayer in that light.  Enjoy the film, the tension, and the tragedy of honor tensioned against friendship, ""aesthetics"" against ""morality,"" and a more exalted expediency born from someplace within.

Some people may be put off by some of the cinematic techniques of the '60s (e.g. instant, obviously artificial rain during the hunt scene), but for me these things merely mark the time during which the film was made.  On the plus side, another mark of this film's era is the exquisitely crafted dialogue.  This stuff is spoken poetry, incomparably performed by some of the best actors of the 20th century.  There are certain handsome themes in the film; Henry's constant feelings of cold in the land he rules yet is not a part of, and Thomas' comfort in the same land which is his own.

Did I mention Peter O'Toole was fantastic?  And Richard Burton's voice is like buttery dark silk.  A sidenote:  The actor who played the reforming, tumultuous monk John was yet another bright spot in a stellar film.",1200009600,,2832,4.738241308793456

Did religion suddenly hit him? No doubt it was gradual, but the film doesn't provide any subtlety to Becket's transformation.

Hal Wallis produced and Peter Glenville directed this wonderful period film based on the play by French dramatist Jean Anouilh.  Lucienne Hill translated the play into English and David Merrick produced it on stage.  This is a wonderful movie starring Peter O'Toole, as William the Conqueror's descendant Henry II, and Richard Burton, as Thomas Becket his servant friend.  They spend their time together chasing women, hunting and basically partying.  Becket has been well educated.  He is loaded with charm and diplomacy.  As king, Henry decides to expand his power base by making his friend Becket Chancellor.  Then in a turn of fate, after Archbishop Theobold dies, has him installed as Archbishop of Canterbury.  Henry sees this as a chance to get his man in the right place to control the church and especially the church's money.  What is interesting to note is that Becket recognizes the problems that this new position will cause even though Henry doesn't sense the division that is being created.  He begs Henry ""Don't do this thing"".  Henry unwittingly sets the battle ground forcing Becket to choose between friendship and his new found religious convictions.  The right to try clerics belonged only to the church council but Henry wants more control.  He wants to change the law's jurisdiction by placing church officials under the crown's rule.  When a cleric is charged with a civil crime and killed escaping Henry's men, Becket's allegiance changes away from Henry towards the church.  The conflicts of Church and Crown are played out between the now changed Becket and the now bitter Henry.

Luckily this film adaptation cuts off the Saracen mother, yet the music and the singing of Gwendolyn introduces another anachronism: the song is in Welsh, that is to say in a Celtic dialect and not in Saxon at all, though originally, historically it could only be in English (if English could already be considered as existing) or in French. There is an antagonistic situation in England at the time: the social antagonism between the merchants and the nobles. Thomas Becket was not a nobleman, nor a baron, but he was the son of a merchant. Anouilh replaced this social antagonism with an ethnic opposition: it is wrong though I do not pretend it is entirely false. Yet fifty years later the Saxon and Norman barons will unite with the church as a whole against the king (the younger brother John known as Landless of the eldest son of Henry II, presented as Henry III in the film) to impose the Magna Carta. The film has a tremendous advantage over the text of the play: it visualizes the meaning with real settings. The splendor of the situations and the court can be seen, though the director, and probably producer never insisted in doing an epic film. So things remain moderate and contain no battle whatsoever. Now the film explains the whole situation as a conflict between the Saxons and the Normans as basic for the conflict between the church and the crown. This is historically false. The conflict is between royal power and church power. The king is trying to impose royal justice and tax paying to the church. He will succeed as for tax paying thanks to Becket himself when Chancellor but he will fail as for justice, at least partly. The repentance and penance of the King is determined politically but not so much as a conflict between once again the Saxons and the Normans, but as the result of a conflict between Eleanor of Aquitania, the Queen, and her son Henry III, the eldest son who had been crowned before the death of his father by his father's decision. These two were trying to set up a rebellion against the king to seize power. But the film is also badly historically informed in the fact that the pilgrimage started before the king's penance (Friday July 12, 1174) and the sanctification was the Pope's decision and once again before the king's penance, on Ash Wednesday February 21, 1173. These mistakes are of course in the play and are Jean Anouilh's. In fact they are not mistakes. They are rewriting history by Anouilh in order in 1959 to satisfy his own personal desires in Paris. He was probably thinking of Poland, Hungary and even Algeria in the late 1950s more than of England in the twelfth century. These subtleties could easily go through in Broadway New York, 1962, but they could have been slightly modified for the film, and they were indeed by dropping the Saracen mother for example: they could have been more. Then the film insists on the love Henry feels for Thomas and here again Anouilh tricks everyone by making that love excessive, even in a way suspicious, and yet based on something historians are quite doubtful about: the real common interest in and sharing of good cheer, wine and women. The acting of Peter O'Toole makes that love become little by little hysterical which is a rather surprising mistake: it could be somber, inwardly contemplative, but not jealous and uncontrolled as it is shown here. It would have been frowned upon at the time, and a lot more than in the film from the Queen Mother and the Queen. The film though minimizes the austere life of the archbishop, though it could have rebalance this element that is definitely made minimal by Anouilh and this deprives us of an explanation as for the sudden change of attitudes of brother John. Note he is a Saxon monk and here Anouilh could have insisted on the fact that Becket was the first archbishop who opposed the Barons who recaptured their Saxon serfs when they escaped into some religious order or monastery. The film is very good indeed but it has all the defects of the play behind it, justly corrected of the most salient elements that were quite absurd at times.

226551,5,6300198731,"Well, when the ""he""  is Peter O'Toole, one of the greatest that ever was, you know this movie must be something. In fact it is. Paring (and soon sparing) two of the best actors of all time, with Peter O'Toole in what was called the role of his life, creates a masterpiece of cinema. and certainly the greatest of the ""castle flicks"".

The details have been mentioned at length, I just wanted to add that it belongs in any movie collection. It is also based on a real historical drama, one that would in no small part determine history as we know it. The struggle between church and state for power, both political and over the hearts and minds of the people, is the backdrop for what becomes a very personal struggle in this film. Nevertheless it lends those personal struggles an importance that makes them never seem silly or self obsessed. In today's struggles we can see that the question of church and state still burns hot in many countries.

226554,5,6300198731,"Made in 1964 as the screen adaptation of the play by Jean Anouilh ""Beckett or the Honor of God"" written in 1959, the film takes place in the 12th Century's England but never for a  second it feels  outdated or old-fashioned. The subjects it explores, the passion and artistry it presents in every scene, its sunning beauty, the use of medieval music, and especially, the incredible craft and chemistry between two great acting legends in their finest performances make the film an outstanding cinematic event and one of the best history/biopics ever made. Magnificent in every sense, ""Becket"" examines the complex relationship between Henry II (Peter O'Toole), by the words of Sir Winston Churchill, one of the ablest and most remarkable of the English kings,  and his best friend from the days if his youth, his trusted confident, his mentor, whom he loved, respected, and appointed his Chancellor, Thomas Beckett (Richard Burton). As Chancellor, Becket was involved in the important acts as the distribution of royal charters, writs and letters. Becket carried out many tasks for Henry II including leading the English army into battle. After Archbishop of Canterbury dies, Henry offers the post to Beckett counting on his unbending loyalty and support in religious questions. To his utmost surprise and anger, Beckett openly defies Henry on the matter of clergymen found guilty of serious crimes. Henry decided that they should be handed over to his courts. Thomas Becket insisted that the church should retain control of punishing its own clergy. The king believed that Becket betrayed him and was determined to obtain revenge which he finally expressed in front of his four knights, ""Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?""

It's been several days since I saw the film but I still can't (and I don't think I ever will) decide whose performance was more powerful and remarkable. Both, O'Toole and Burton are simply outstanding and carry the film effortlessly. They both were nominated by the Academy for best leading roles.  I will always remember the last Burton's words just before his Becket dies hacked with the knights' swords, ""Poor Henry""...In the last moment of his life, he feels sorry for his murderer, his former friend whom he loved but would not betray his principles and beliefs even for him. Another scene is also imprinted in my memory - Henry invites his family for the reunion where he is expected to name his successor. Surrounded by his closest relatives, his mother, his estranged wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, his three sons, whom he never loved nor they loved him. All they want - the throne of England. All he wants - his friend Beckett next to him, but he lost him to God... I'd like to add that the scene of reunion is the source of another film featuring Peter O'Toole as Henry II. In 1968, O'Toole reprised the role of Henry in ""The Lion in Winter"" where his partner was Katherine Hepburn as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. O'Toole was nominated for the Oscar for both films and lost both times.

For the first time since 1964, ""Beckett"" is available on DVD with many bonus features that include Peter O'Toole's commentary, two archival interviews with Richard Burton from 1967 and 1977 where he does not speak about ""Beckett"" but we learned a lot about Richard Burton, the actor and the man, and interviews with editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal. Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, ""Beckett"" won for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should have won much more. It deserves every one of its nominations even now, after all these years.",1183939200,2,3581,4.920529801324503
226555,4,6300198731,"Like most dramas by Jean Anouih (1910-1987), BECKET essentially sets two larger-than-life characters against each other in a relationship fueled by widening ideological rifts.  In this instance, the rift is between the holy and the secular.  King Henry II of England, who--frustrated by the frequent interference of the Roman Catholic Church in his rule--manages to have friend Thomas Becket appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury.  He expects Becket to act on his behalf--and is shocked when Becket undergoes a spiritual transformation and takes his office seriously.

The 1959 play was tremendous successful throughout Europe, in England, and in the United States.  In 1964 it reached the screen with Richard Burton as Becket, Peter O'Toole as Henry II, such notables as John Gielgud as Louis VII of France.  The film was extremely well-received and received numerous critical accolades, particularly for Burton and O'Toole.  It was not, however, widely available to the home market until this 2007 MPI DVD release.

In a technical sense, BECKET looks better than ever; the transfer is very crisp and the picture likely looks better here than it did on the 1964 big screen.  At the same time, however, it is very evident that this is a film that really is best seen on the big screen, where the larger than life characters and their ideological battles have the advantage of a scope to equal their nature.  It also has a slightly stagey quality, most often in the script, which doesn't quite manage to shed the theatrical trappings of the original.

Even so, there's a great deal to admire, and the leading actors are most certainly chief among them.  Burton and O'Toole wench, brawl, argue, and explode with invective with complete conviction; it would be hard, if not impossible, to say which gives the better performance here.  Gielgud is particularly memorable in his brief appearance as Louis VII--and Sian Philips, Pamela Brown, and Martita Hunt make the most of their relatively small roles as well.

The DVD has several notable bonuses.  I personally found the interviews with Richard Burton, archeival footage from 1967 and 1977, slightly over rated--but the ""featurettes"" on editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal are excellent, and the DVD commentary by O'Toole is consistently fascinating.  I personally find the film as a whole a bit dry--Coats, tellingly, makes the comment that if the producers had put just a bit more money into BECKET it would have an undeniable masterpiece--but fans of the film will find this particular package an extremely welcome one.

226651,5,6300198731,"At the end of the twentieth century the Catholic bishops of England and Wales reduced his obligatory feast to an optional memorial. In the sixteenth century the Protestant reformers destroyed his shrine, desecrated his remains, defaced his image wherever they found it, forbad devotion to him and expunged his name from the missals. And in the twelfth century the barons of King Henry II took care, by means of the sword, to rid their sovereign of so troublesome an English priest, indeed Archbishop, as Thomas Becket.

What is it about this man that continued to provoke such ire; that challenged his contemporaries and his subsequent countrymen for centuries? Was he arrogant, single minded, obstinate, full of pride? Is he a hero, a saint, or a fool?

In 1964 a full length feature film of Hall Wallis' `Becket' appeared starring Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole, with a supporting cast of greats including John Gielgud. As a film it had its day and I remember tasting it all too briefly on television as a boy. It never made a great impact in the age of video tapes. But advances in technology have enabled its recent release on DVD affording widespread and affordable popular release to a classic study of a pivotal character in English and ecclesiastical history.

""What if Thomas Becket should discover his honour?"" the profligate, expedient Becket (Burton) asks rhetorically early in the film. On this question alone everything hangs. For, of course, Becket does discover honour: as the stooge Archbishop of Canterbury interposed by Henry II (O'Toole) he discovers the honour of the love of God. All other loves and loyalties  take second place, much to the incomprehension of his friends, enemies and coreligionists. Yet Becket heroically accepts death of the body rather than the suicide of compromise others would have had him embrace.

That Becket's dilemma and ultimate witness, as portrayed in this classic of the cinema, is available to us again in the twenty-first century by virtue of modern technology is very good indeed for it raises questions that both modern and medieval men ignore to their peril.

Perhaps, though, one should hasten to secure a copy of the DVD, for who knows when or how the next potentate will move to attempt to silence his voice?",1182384000,2,2273,4.968421052631579

226655,5,6300198731,"One of my favourite films of all time, Becket, has come available, at long last, on DVD.  This was a film whose masters were thought lost at once, and potential DVD transfers would have then been substandard - a sorry fate for such a magnificent film, one that garnered a dozen Oscar nominations.  I place this film in the same league as `A Man for All Seasons' and what may well be considered in some senses the sequel to Becket, `The Lion in Winter.'

The film begins and ends in Becket's tomb in the Cathedral of Canterbury, not far from where Becket was murdered/martyred.  Becket became a folk hero, a canonised saint, and the stuff of myth and legend, as useful in politics as in literature - Chaucer's famous pilgrims telling their Canterbury tales were on their way to the same location as Henry II paid his penance for the death of Becket.

The idea of the separation of church and state is an admittedly modern invention, but even in Becket's time, the intertwining of religious politics and secular politics was seen to have decided drawbacks.  The church in most European settings has historically been a wealthy land-owning institution; in England (for much of its history, in fact a rather poor and beknighted land in many ways), the church rivaled the wealth of the monarch for generations.  This sets up a background rivalry for Becket and Henry II while they are both on the same side (Henry II appointed Thomas Becket as his chancellor, a position not dis-similar to being his first, or prime, minister).  When Henry decided to take control of the church by appointing his own man as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Becket then has what some have described as a road-to-Damascus conversion experience - the film follows this interpretation.

`Honour is a private matter within.  It is an idea, and every man has his own version of it.'

Early in the film, King Henry asks Becket how he can reconcile being a man of honour with being a collaborator with the Norman conquerors. Becket hedges on the answer, enjoy the fruits of the reflected honour and glory of the king in his life.  Later, as Becket is elevated to the archbishopric as senior churchman in England, he finds the honour and glory of God, made manifest in `holy mother church', to be so overwhelming as to cast a shadow over duty to the king.

Peter O'Toole gives one of his most memorable performances as Henry II, a role he would reprise in `The Lion in Winter'.  Richard Burton plays Becket in one of his best roles - in fact, this might well have been Burton's career-defining role.  Burton's deep Welsh accent sets him apart audibly from the more polished English accent of O'Toole, a good device for setting up the Saxon/Norman difference.  John Gielgud has a minor role as the king of France, for which he even received an Oscar nomination, though given the low number of minutes on the screen and the do-nothingness of the role makes one wonder at the politics behind that particular nomination (Gielgud is certainly deserving of such honours, but this role isn't weighty enough to warrant it).  O'Toole and Becket play the friendship in a way that in lesser hands would have edged on camp; devoted to each other in many ways, one senses in O'Toole's performance a Henry that is as upset at Becket's betrayal as he would be at a lover's infidelity.  Special mention goes to Sian Phillips (Livia in `I, Claudius'), who plays Becket's paramour, stolen from him by the king.  Her role is brief but significant.

`We both belong to a conquered race, but you've forgotten that people robbed of everything can still have one thing left to call their own,' Gwendolyn pleads.

`Yes,' Becket replies.  `Where honour should be, in me there is only a void.'

This exchange helps set the stage for the later transformation.

After Becket's elevation to the archbishopric and his subsequent exile from England, both Becket and Henry make haste to the Pope in Rome, for his judgement in the matter of who was to have ultimate authority over the church in England (a question that would continue for several hundred years, until another Henry would make a final break with Rome).  Lines of authority are confused in that both the position of archbishop and the position of king are seen as divinely warranted, and difficult to enforce, given the distance (and number of armies) between England and Rome.

Ultimately, Becket returns to England, but receives a welcome that makes King Henry jealous and nervous, causing him to utter perhaps the most famous line in the ordeal:

`Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?'

Several knights, drunk from carousing with the king, take this as a royal command, and rush to the cathedral, striking Becket down in his sanctuary, both to the sadness and the relief of the king.

This film was produced by Hal Wallis (known also for `Casablanca' and `True Grit') at a time when the producer's name was as significant, if not more so, than the director's name (in this case, Peter Glenville).  The look-and-feel of the film is radically different from either `Casablanca' and `True Grit' in almost every aspect other than the sweeping nature of the emotions and the excellent nature of the portrayals on-screen.  The screenplay was adapted by Edward Anhalt (who was also nominated for the Oscar) from the play by Jean Anouilh.  As such, it is markedly different from some treatments of the Becket story such as Eliot's `Murder in the Cathedral', although the idea of spiritual pride being a temptation does factor into this film's interpretation of Becket, too.

The cinematography, costume, and set design are at a very high standard, in keeping with many of the better productions of the 1960s.  The costumes are more in keeping with `Hollywood' than authenticity, particularly with some of the more elaborate ecclesial and royal costumes.

Excellent historical movie about Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury who defied Henry II, King of England and got murdered for it. The film starred Richard Burton as Becket and Peter O'Toole as ""his King"", both at their prime. Two superb actors going at it make this movie utterly interesting to watch.

The DVD proves to be well presented. The colors are sharp and vivid, images are clean and clear and sound proves to be just perfect. I am not sure about the comments made by one previous reviewer but I had no problem with the sound on my sound system. The extra features were pretty nice but the crown jewel of this DVD would have to be the running commentary provided by Peter O'Toole as he talked about the film. His words proves to be highly interesting and entertaining with few breaks in between.

For the historical minded, I thought the movie captured the spirit and conflict between these two men pretty well. In the film, Becket was portaryed as a ""Saxon"" but history tell us that he was Norman by birth. History also tell us that he was recommended as Chancellor by the Archbishop of Canterbury Theobald to Henry II as well. So the movie played loose with real history but the characters of the both personalities I thought, was well captured. And this is a movie about character study more then history study.

The movie come well recommended, there isn't much bloodshed here, very little action scenes but the dialogues are sharp, script superbly written and acting is some of the best ever seen. Geared more toward the mature and intellicual minded viewers, its a pretty involving costume drama that tells more then history but morality and ethics of individuals.",1180224000,8,1778,4.710610932475884

He's put himself on the line for almost two decades helming the Film Foundation, bringing public attention to the need for film preservation. Without the Foundation's efforts, such masterworks as Lawrence of Arabia, How Green Was My Valley, On the Waterfront, and Rear Window might have been lost to movie audiences forever.

Now, thanks to the Foundation and to Academy Film Archive director Michael Pogorzelski's painstaking restoration, the 1964 romantic classic Becket has been re-released in all its pomp, pageantry, and Technicolor glory.

Fresh off his brilliant turn in Lawrence of Arabia, Peter O'Toole gives a bombastic, explosive performance as the hated Angevin king of England, Henry II. In one of his finest screen roles, legendary Welsh actor Richard Burton plays his enforcer, Thomas  Becket, with cool-headed erudition.

Whether looting among the Saxons, taking liberties with wenches, or even having his wife taken from him by Henry, Becket's a loyal pal and reliable stooge. Then, one day, trying to put one over on the pesky clergy, Henry devises a brilliant scheme to install his drinking buddy as Archbishop of Canterbury.

But what begins as a fun romp in the ""buddy picture"" tradition veers into the sublime when Becket begins to understand the enormous gravity and honor required by his office. Transformed from yes-man into his own man, he refuses to render the things holy before God to O'Toole's spoiled brat of a Caesar, who is driven to betray Becket by an unrequited love that dare not speaketh its name.

A fascinating study of integrity in the face of corruption, Becket is an unforgettable Medieval epic from the same decade that gave us A Man for All Seasons and The Lion in Winter (also starring O'Toole).

226782,5,6300198731,"When Henry II entrusted his close friend Thomas Becket with the title of Chancellor of England, Becket proved himself a loyal and trustworthy ally.  But when Henry decided he needed his friend to replace the recently departed Bishop of Canterbury, he never dreamed that Becket would place his duty to God before his loyalty to the monarchy.  Thus sets up the historically flawed but dramatically compelling conflict behind the play and film Becket.  They just don't make films like this anymore, and it is a genuine treat to marvel at the unparalleled skills of these two thespians in their prime.  Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole are both great joys to behold, and the supporting cast, led by a much too-brief but amazing performance by John Gielgud as King Philip of France, are every bit as delicious as the literate, thoughtful script and the sumptuous, colorful sets and costumes.

Edward Anhalt's screenplay of Jean Anouilh's brilliant play won the Oscar for Best Screenplay; the film was nominated for 12 additional Academy Awards, and received 22 other industry awards and nominations.  The intelligent and literate dialogue is so full of raw gems that to quote any one line here would do a gross disservice to the balance of the script.

As breathtaking as Burton is, Peter O'Toole reveals an appreciation of the character of Henry II that, unbelievable as it may seem, gloriously precedes and anticipates his magnificent portrayal of the same king in The Lion in Winter, just five years later.  But where Lion in Winter proffered a brilliant, witty script and an amazingly modern take on medieval court intrigue, Becket offers meaty drama and dead serious, soul-searching introspection.  And unlike his polished portrayal of the self-assured Henry at age 50 in the brilliant James Goldman comedy, O'Toole's portrayal of the younger King Henry in Becket is raw, vulgar, crass and just what you would expect the lesser-experienced monarch to be, until Becket teaches him a royal lesson in humility and penance.  As for Burton, well, his eyes speak paragraphs, and his clear understanding of a complex role and that magnificent voice combine to demonstrate once and for all that he was one of the most talented screen actors of the 20th century.

The DVD extras and brilliant restoration round out the release to make this the not-to-be-missed video event of 2007.  Highly recommended.",1179792000,12,2393,5.061068702290076

and told so it is great that this movie tackles it. It's a Shakesperean story with maybe less twists and turns but the feel is there with the monarchy in the forefront and the study of a King (Henry second). I would consider this film an almost epic cause all the ingredients are there (costumes, art direction) but the budget was thinner like the great epics of the era so it feels more independant let's say which is not a criticism. The cinematography is superior and also the great performances and the direction of Peter Glenville. The only thing is, the thing I hate the most about a transfer was there which is the instability of the image. Don't get me wrong the transfer is ok and the colors are rich and the sharpness of the image is correct but often enough the image moves and wasn't stable and man I hate that. I don't blame the company who did the transfer for the reason that they give us this great title but I had to say it cause it bothered me a little bit.

Problem is that Becket was every bit as Norman as Henry. Because it is a major theme of the play, it is hard to zone out. Once you pass that, however, the film is one of the great films of all time.

""Becket"" was the most satisfying experience I had in a cinema in a year and that's pretty high praise for a year that saw ""The Departed"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and ""Little Miss Sunshine"".  After seeing it I wanted to go back to experience the magic again.  ""Becket"" may be a period piece but it's more of a character study about two friends who've grown estranged due to philosophical differences.  The spectacle of this film is the kinetic chemistry of two of the finest actors ever squaring off.  Richard Burton's understated Becket and O'Toole's over-the-top Henry meld, even when they don't share screen time, like fine wine.  These are two actors at the top of their game that it is not unimaginable that Burton and O'Toole could switch roles and the film would be just as good.

226877,5,6300198731,"What a treat for moviegoers to see this magnificent film on the big screen again after 43 years. Originally released in 1964, directed by Peter Glenville and starring Richard Burton as Thomas Becket and Peter O'Toole as Henry ll, BECKET holds up well with time. Based on the play by the same name by Jean Anouilh, the movie is based-- with cinematic license here and there; for example he is a dirty Saxon here-- on the life and martyrdom of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. (Both Tennyson and Eliot produced major works on the same subject matter.) Although many period pieces like this one are visually stunning to watch, as this one is, they often leave the viewer cold, as this one does but in this instance because of superb acting. Henry complains often that he is always cold and that Becket is not warm in his affection to him. This coldness is so real as to be palpable in the theatre.

It is a pleasure to watch Burton and O'Toole in their verbal fencing as both actors give as good as they get. Neither actor ever looked or acted  better. The scene where Becket and Henry meet on horseback at the sea and Becket tells Henry that he will never see him again is worth whatever you paid to see the movie. Other actors besides O'Toole and Burton give outstanding performances as well, particularly John Gielgud as King Louis VII and David Weston as the young Brother John, Becket's disciple and attendant.

BECKET is about big themes-- honor (Becket: ""I am waiting for the honor of the God and the king to be one, my lord""), friendship and love-- and  a film for all seasons.",1171065600,7,1590,4.548951048951049

226948,3,6300198731,"Re-released for 2007 is 1964's ""Becket.""  As parts seem surprisingly risqu for 1964, I'm assuming that some originally deleted material has been re-inserted.  While there is no question as to the principal character's saintliness, the film raised a few questions in my mind about its historical accuracy.

As per the film review of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ""Becket"" is ""The 12th-century saga...of the deep friendship and later conflict between England's King Henry II...and his friend, Sir Thomas a Becket..., and how their days of drinking and womanizing came to an end when the monarch decided to appoint Becket archbishop of Canterbury.  Much to Henry's surprise, Becket was transformed into a deeply spiritual man of God, who took his new responsibilities very seriously....The film charts how Becket went head-to-head with the king over the vigilante murder of an erring priest by one of Henry's knights. Henry's famous despairing cry, `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?' -- leads to Becket's martyrdom in his cathedral.""  Amazingly, the USCCB also reports that the film is completely in error over Becket's ethnicity - a central concern of the movie!

While the Catholic Encyclopedia agrees on much of the details, there are several noteworthy differences:

* The Catholic Encyclopedia seems to indicate that Thomas' conversion was somewhat less dramatic, and that his pre-archbishop years were chaste (or at least more so than what the movie indicates).

* The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions nothing about the unnamed priest's alleged crime.  Yet, it does indicate that Thomas strongly opposed Henry's effort ""to bring clerics guilty of crimes under the jurisdiction of the secular courts.""  Looking back over the scandals of the past few years, one result seems that - in our own time - the secular world is again exercising too much jurisdiction over clerics (My own opinion, of course).

* The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions nothing about Henry's famous line.  It also indicates that Henry's culpability for Thomas' murder is not clear.

While some seem to suggest that Mother Theresa & Pope John Paul II may be on ""fast tracks,"" the Catholic Encyclopedia confirms that ""The pope promulgated the bull of canonization, little more than two years after the martyrdom, 21 February, 1173.""",1170720000,2,2332,5.27027027027027

The movie itself is superb on every level -- the terrific screenplay, the acting, directing and production design stand out -- but driving everything is the timeless force of the moral theme in all its various guises.  And the cinema gods said, ""It is good and we are well-pleased.""

226950,4,6300198731,"This 1964 film garnered twelve Academy Award nominations, and age has not diminished its power to engage the viewer. Fueled by two powerful performances that drive the entire film, that of Peter O'Toole as Henry II and that of Richard Burton as Thomas Becket, this history based drama explains the conflict that caused the assassinatiom and subsequent canonization of Becket.

Henry II, England's twelfth century Norman King, elevated Thomas Becket, a commoner and Saxon peasant, to the lofty position of Chancellor of England. Famous friends, they drank, caroused and wenched together. All was well between them until Henry takes it into his head to appoint Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury, the most powerful cleric in England, though Becket begs his friend not to do this. Ignoring the heartfelt plea of his friend, he makes it so, under the belief that this would indirectly bring the Catholic Church of England under his dominion and control.

Simultaneously both Archbishop and Chancellor, Becket became the most powerful man, secularly and religiously, in England with one fell swoop. This political move by Henry did not work out as he had envisioned, however, as Becket found himself in the position of being able only to render to the King that which was the King's and to God that which was God's. Becket took his position of Archbishop of Canterbury very seriously and was uncompromising in his view, a devotion to God that Henry had not bargained on. This created conflict between Becket and Henry. The friendship and love that had existed between them for so long, now quickly turned to bitter hate on Henry's part for what he perceived to be a betrayal of that friendship. For the first time in his life, Henry had a rival with whom he could not compete: God.

This was to lead to a battle of wills between the two that would culminate in a tragedy that would become memorialized for all time. This film attempts to capture the events that led up to Becket's eventual martyrdom. It succeeds masterfully. A somewhat hammy Peter O'Toole is terrific as the selfish King Henry II. A more restrained Richard Burton is compelling as the troubled and angst ridden Becket, who ultimately chooses his devotion to God over the dictates of his King and friend.

This was probably my ""punishment"" for being the first to post, on January 30th, the fact that MPI was releasing ""Becket"" in the DVD edition on May 15, 2007. My post, meant to be nothing more than joyous news for ""Becket"" fans, was removed by someone in Amazon, twice! Today's attempt to file a ""Becket"" review, October 11, 2007, will be my last: ***

It would be easy to write paragraphs of praise for ""Becket"" for so many reasons. But what makes it unique to me is the perfect balance of the energies and talents of two such powerful and masterful actors as Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.

This is shown first as the two (Becket and Henry, respectively) are fast friends and staunch allies in supporting the position of the King and the success of England. But it is just as powerful and robust when they become enemies. Each has enormous powers of projection, in love and hate, in happy humor as well as acidic acrimony and sarcasm. And we see the dynamic forces in motion in the personalities of the two throughout the story. At the very beginning, they are like two young guys, partying all night, and actually very much alike. By the end of the story, Henry is an almost insane wretch, convulsing with both his love and hate for Becket, while Becket has developed from clever statesman and master negotiator to being almost a pure warrior of God, surrendering everything and his life itself to ""Your Divine Will"".

And the icing on the cake is the equally poised and perfectly balanced uses of both explosive, vicious rages, as well as sophisticated spontaneous humor. You may expect to feel mentally and spiritually exhausted after watching this story unfold because so much of ""you"", and ""Everyman"" is engaged in the effects of it.

Surely at least some of the praise for this masterful balance between two actors whose symbiotic powerhouse energies and magnificent polish put ""Becket"" into a class by itself is deserved by Director, Peter Glenville. Perhaps a good deal of the success is due to the fondness and friendship of Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole for each other. All this combined with the talents of so many other truly great actors and actresses, the cinematography, the sets, and the heroic, magnificent restoration that has, at last, given us this DVD version have, in the aggregate, given us what I believe to be one of the five best movies ever made.",1151971200,,2560,4.682222222222222

Eliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral' is but the most recent acclaimed literary treatment; each revisitation seems to draw new elements forth from the story. Edward Anhalt won the Oscar for best screenplay (adapted from other material) for this film. This film shows Henry and Thomas Becket roughly equal in age (at variance from history, for in this time the age difference of 15 years is practically a generational difference). Becket is shown as being a guide to Henry, but less from a master/pupil standpoint as it is a clever diplomatic with a utilitarian and almost Machiavellian sense about him. Henry is presented as coarse and unrefined, uneducated and in need of assistance, but historically this is unlikely.

Becket is played admirably by Richard Burton; Henry II is portrayed by Peter O'Toole. Both were nominated for the best actor Oscar, but neither won. In addition to these nominations and the best screenplay award, the film was nominated for nine other Oscars, running the list from costumes, music, directing, best picture, and a best supporting actor nod for John Gielgud, whose cameo as the King of France is rather interestingly presented.

Indeed, the movie has a remarkable realistic feel to it, particularly for a film from the 1960s, when cinema was as likely to portray stylised and idealistic images of the past. The sets are in bare stone with a minimum of ornamentation, as would have been the case in Plantagenet times; likewise, the ceremony around the royal person is much less grand, and the church rather grand, which is both accurate and serves to highlight the underlying conflict of the story in the film.

Becket is portrayed as a man of ambiguous loyalties -- a man of principle who has yet to find principles worthy of loyalty. Finally, in the role of archbishop, he finds a calling from the honour of God (and in so doing is not unlikely many priests who see their path to ordination as the means of spiritual grace; indeed, many are disappointed that the faith does not come with the office). Whether Thomas Becket actually experienced a spiritual conversion that made him a strong champion of the church, or in fact saw the power of the church as a means to an end of dominating the country, we will perhaps never know.

In the film, Becket is often disparaged as being a Saxon; this is perhaps overstated, given his Norman lineage, which is never hinted at in the film. While he does not come from Norman nobility, he is far from being a simple Saxon. Burton's portrayal of Becket shows the change from worldly chancellor to spiritual archbishop in unsubtle terms. Even so, there is an ambiguity that plays out marvelously in both his performance, and the reactions of the other characters who constantly question his sincerity.

O'Toole's performance is not as polished as Burton's; when he plays an older, wiser Henry II in 'The Lion in Winter' four years later, the acting is much more dramatic and effective. It perhaps goes without saying that Pamela Brown does not make the same impression on the screen as Eleanor of Aquitaine as Katherine Hepburn does in the later film, but Eleanor is an incidental character in Becket in any case.

Music in this film is not a prominent feature -- various trumpet and brass flourishes announce events or major scene changes in parts; a lot of chant (long before Gregorian chant achieved popular status) accompanies church scenes -- indeed, I credit this film for giving me my first real taste of Gregorian chant. The scene with Sian Phillips as Becket's love Gwendolyen is accompanied by period string instruments -- again, Phillips is a remarkable actress who is under-utilised in this performance.

Done in a flash-back manner, there is a resolution in the film -- Becket is dead, made a saint, honour is satisfied as the King does penance, and the people are happy. We know what is going to happen, but then, anyone with knowledge of history would likely know the story already. In fact, Henry's reign was rarely without challenge, but he was always powerful, and much more effective after Becket's death than before. Reigning for nearly twenty years after Becket's death, he left a very powerful Western European coalition of lands that soon fell apart, and embroiled England and France in war for centuries later. The tensions between church and state carry forward to this day; while the specifics of the challenges faces Becket and Henry II are very different from issues today, the principle of the relationship between church and state is far from definitively resolved.

Also, the side-line issue of class warfare and racial prejudice (teased out with subtle nuance between the Normans and Saxons, who, ironically, look exactly the same on the screen) are addressed in an interesting, pre-civil rights sort of manner. This issue is never resolved in the film, as indeed it wasn't in the 1960s, either.

This is an intriguing film, with great acting and great production values, and an interesting story that, even if not completely historically accurate, does not alter the history so much that it becomes a parody of the subject.",1138147200,6,5193,4.9122006841505135

227044,5,6300198731,"Peter Glenville's Becket is one of the earliest movies that shows the differences between state and church. Set in 12th century England, this has Peter O'Toole as Henry II and his friend Richard Burton as the Archbishop of Canterbury. It has one of the finest cast and outstanding screenplay. Richard Burton has often been complained for overacting his parts, this movie is one were his part is beautifully played were he gradually changes from a loyal servant of the King to one who becomes loyal to God. Peter O'Toole performance is also fantastic were he is torn between the love for his friend and the hatred that he has for the new power that he has to fight. I doubt if there are any actors now except probably Anthony Hopkins who can play this well.

That year saw the release of My Fair Lady that pretty much vanquished all the other movies. Though Rex Harrison is an outstanding actor and that movie is superb, it was more popular than this one. It was also intelligently made and the appeal was not lost to the Oscar people. So, our two people lost yet again. This was the one time when they lost to a reasonable actor (I think). In all, they lost 7 times, sometimes to not so great actors, which was really sad. Luck has a lot to do with it. The movie won for best screenplay, which one will understand why.

The film starts out with mirth and becomes serious when the previous Archbishop dies and Henry, who was always opposed by the church, finally decides to get his friend appointed to the post. He does not realize that Thomas Becket has been trying to find his honor and this appointment lets him find it. In history, the final separation happens when Henry VIII creates the church of England to marry Anne Boleyn. Both the King and the Bishop play their parts very well and there are points that one can argue for both. In all, it is a wonderfully made movie, which everyone would adore. The movie is more to do with friendship and its interaction with the person's job than to do with religion. The movie is well directed and subtle. Supporting actors such as John Gielgud do a very good job. This movie is listed to come out in DVD sometime by the end of the year (12/30/2005) in two online DVD stores (though I have been disappointed in the past).",1127174400,16,2268,4.462650602409639

227109,5,6300198731,"I don't know if Thomas Becket ever existed in real life, but this is still a good telling of his life, and that God is the only one who doesn't fail. The story begins when Becket and King Henry the second are young men, and the best of friends, and how Becket is portrayed as the servant friend, and anchor that Henry so needs. However, this friendship is tested as Henry makes Becket the new Archbishop of Cantebury figuring that Henry could use Becket as a puppet Archbishop, and he could get whatever he wanted from anyone he wanted. This would backfire though as Becket proves to be more of an Archbishop than Henry wants him to be, and it's not done for show Becket really means this that he's making the commitment that he's going to commit to God this service, and a young man who almost tore Becket apart earlier in the movie now sees this, and becomes his servant, and companion. Henry seething with anger that Becket is going to do his job for real still hopes he can make Becket fall back into doing his will, but when it doesn't look like it will happen Becket pays the ultimate price with his life as Henry arranges for Becket's death. In the end however, Henry is filled with anger and rage that it had to come to Becket's death, but at the same time there's reverence in Henry, and he declares that Becket be worshipped as a saint. I don't know if Henry would go further, or not as it was left in Henry's hands to be repentant, or to just go about his business. This was done up very well, and both Peter O Toole as King Henry and Richard Burton as Becket both turned in fabulous performances.

227115,4,6300198731,"Easily one of my favorite films, showcasing the wonderful talents of O'Toole and Burton, it triumphs as a play but is a dismal failure as history.  The premise of the story is that the Saxon Becket has collaborated with the Norman Henry finding a realistic and somewhat existentialistic view of his situation.  The play was written by a Frenchman after WW II who can speak with some authority about the joys of collaboration.  In real life, Becket was Norman, Henry was Angevin, and without doubt the greatest of all medieval English kings.  Founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, he is remember for having given us our common civil law, which Becket steadfastly objects to.  The implied homosexual affair between the two may or may not be true, but whatever the real relationship it goes down as one of the greatest betrayals in history.  Henry's wife, Eleanor, is shown as a shrew, not the devastating beauty and wiley she-wolf she was and is portrayed in The Lion In Winter.  What the film does very well is portray the somber Latin rituals of the Catholic Church, and the conflict between Church and State that reach bloodshed here, and would be resolved only 300 years later with another King Henry and another Chancellor named Thomas as told in the marvelous A Man For All Seasons.  This struggle between civil and church power is very timely even today, and well worth our time to examine it's roots with this wonderfully entertaining, but historically flawed tale.",1104883200,2,1469,4.848

227201,5,6300198731,"""Becket"" explores the question put to Christ two millenia ago of whether man owes his primary loyalty to his monarch or to God.  The search for the resolution of that question, and how it was answered, makes ""Becket"" one of the best historical dramas ever made.  Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton are in top form as the young Henry II of England and his partner-in-mayhem Thomas Becket, whose primary interests are wine and women and not necessarily in that order.  England in the 12th century was devoutly Roman Catholic, and the Catholic hierarchy enjoyed a level of power and prestige equal to, if not higher than, the king himself.  But when the old archbishop dies and Henry needs to appoint a successor in his place, Henry outfoxes everyone by doing an end run around the bishops and naming Becket as the new archbishop.  The bishops are upset; they believe Henry intends for Becket to be a puppet figure to be used to further the king's own ends.  But to everyone's surprise, Becket takes his job more seriously than Henry ever intended.  No one could be more stunned and shocked at this development than Henry himself.

The confrontation between Henry and the clergy is set immediately following the old archbishop's death, when Henry informs the assembled bishops that there will only be one head honcho in England, and that is the king.  The bishops are not used to having their power abrogated by anyone outside the church; they answer only to the pope and to God.  The king and clergy are on collision course, and Henry, to his chagrin, finds that Becket is solidly on the side of the Church his king has appointed him to represent.  There will be no compromise here.  The stage is thus set for a fateful confrontation.

One has to wonder: when Henry blurted out his petulant rhetorical question ""Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?"", did he really not expect to be taken at his word?  He's made it clear over and over again that he is the king, and the king is the law.  So it's hard not to feel a sense of disgust at Henry's hypocrisy as he undergoes a ritual flogging in the cathedral crypt to expiate his guilt at having instigated Becket's murder, and immediately afterwards announces on the church steps that Becket will be venerated as a saint.  Power-hungry to the last, Henry has abrogated to himself the privilege of an announcement that should have come from the new archbishop, or from the pope who alone has the power of canonization.

The film has everything going for it: a great plot, two excellent performances by Burton and O'Toole, terrific direction and cinematography, and fine historical accuracy.  The Gregorian chant running through the scenes in the cathedral transport the viewer 700 years back in time.  For two unforgettable hours, we're part of 12th century England.

And finally, let me add my request to those of the other reviewers of this excellent movie: Will someone please hurry up and release this film on DVD?  I'll be first in line to buy it.

This review is being UPDATED on 5/23/07 to add the following:

Since I first reviewed this movie three years ago, my opinion of the acting, plot, characterization and script writing has not changed.  This is a magnificent film by any criteria.  I wish I say the same for the DVD.  The picture quality is terrific.  The sound quality, however, is not nearly as good, and for anyone who is hearing-impaired, a very serious problem is that this DVD is NOT closed captioned.  The audio track is in English, French and Spanish.  There are English subtitles for those who require them, but accessing them is tricky on some DVD players.

It looks like whoever put this film on DVD was trying to cut corners.  This movie deserves better.

227202,5,6300198731,"Peter Glenville's direction of this film in no way diminishes the quality of acting among members of the cast, notably Burton and O'Toole, both of whom were nominated for an Academy Award for best actor in a leading role; however, Glenville allows a somewhat sluggish pace which reduces the dramatic impact of the plot, and especially of the multi-dimensional relationship between Thomas Becket (Burton) and his monarch, Henry II (O'Toole). In fact, Edward Anhalt received an Academy Award for his adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play. I wish Glenville had made better use of his cast as well as of Anhalt's screenplay. That said, Burton and O'Toole are magnificent. They portray youthful best friends who share a commitment to hedonism...and to little else. Later, Henry II selects an obviously reluctant Becket (by then a priest) to serve as Archbishop of Canterbury. Becket's acceptance marks a defining moment which he recognizes but his king does not: Henceforth his highest loyalty will be to Almighty God, not to the occupant of the English throne. Opinions vary as to whether or not the historical Henry specifically ordered Becket's assassination but all agree that he would never have authorized it to be done in Canterbury Cathedral. Nonetheless it was.
This is a visually stunning film, perhaps even moreso than (for example) The Lion in Winter (1968) in which O'Toole also appears as Henry II. Granted, the relationship between Henry and Eleanor in that film is quite different from Henry's relationship with Becket. Also, The Lion in Winter covers only a few days during one Christmas season whereas the timeframe in Becket extends over several decades. However, both films focus on conflicting as well as congenial relationships. In Becket, Henry (in effect) finds himself competing with God for Becket's loyalty and devotion. He loses. The supporting cast is first-rate. Notably John Gielgud (Louis VII), Donald Wolfit (Bishop Folliot), Martita Hunt (Queen Matilda), and Gino Cervi (Cardinal Zambelli). The role of Queen Eleanor (Pamela Brown) is minor when contrasted with Eleanor (Katherine Hepburn) as she is presented in The Lion in Winter.
Question: Why is there no DVD version of Becket?
Those who share my high regard for this film are urged to check out the aforementioned The Lion in Winter as well as Cromwell (1970), Elizabeth (1998), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Anne of the Thousand Days(1969), and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971).",1076976000,8,2454,5.168341708542713

Seking more influence over the Roman Catholic Church of England Henry appoints Becket as the Archbishop of Canterbury. After assuming his new duties Becket takes the job too seriously for the king's liking. Henry feels betrayed and from this point on the film moves relentlessly toward its tragic conclusion.

227204,5,6300198731,"I can only speak of the LaserDisc edition, which in itself was good enough to have the Widescreen version of such a masterpiece.
Richard Burton (Becket) and Peter O'Toole (Henry II, Plantagenet, a role he would reprise four years later in ""The Lion in Winter"", another masterpiece), deliver a vivid and excruciating portrayal of two close friends to whom life reserves a cruel surprise.
Based on true events and characters of the 13th Century, but translated to the screen from the same play, which in turn, was adapted from ""Murder in the Cathedral"", this historic portrayal of Feudal England is very imaginative and well done.
The two actors deliver powerful performances and the story, with all its subplots, is solid storytelling of the best kind.
The only thing that kills me, is why, oh why, Paramount, with its wonderful Star Trek franchise and re-release techniques, never came to the idea to re-release this one on DVD as well!!!
Perhaps the eternal fight over rights and who gets what and when, will go on forever. Greed seems to rule the world even when it comes to real masterpieces of art and history.
Producers go insane and studios uptight, not to use another euphemism for it.
Whatever happened to reasonable, creative and talented producers of yesteryear? And what about chasing bankers, lawyers and the kind out of Hollywood and instead bring back guys a la Talberg, Mayer, Selznick and Warner, who had a sense for the business, but also had a creative talent and the interest of the public at heart?
Marlon Brando once said, that no one should be rewarded just for doing his job. How right. How wise.
There are too many awards and rewards out there and too little true talent that deserves them.
But that's the world of business, not that of creative minds.
So, in conclusion, buy the videotape (it's well worth it, although I would wait for the DVD release anyway, otherwise you may spend twice the money) or, if you still own a LD player, try to get hold of the LaserDisc. The image resolution is sharper, although the sound is still a miserable and conventional Mono.
I hope that in some way, whenever, whomever will be so generous as to release a DVD version of it, may also want to clean it up somewhat and perhaps remaster the sound and the picture quality.
I know perfectly well, that some movies were simply produced in Mono. Sometimes to spare money and sometimes, plainly because the director wanted so. But hey, we're living in the 21st Century now, not in the 1960's, so why wouldn't even purists see how far better a stereo sound is?
I mix my own sounds and I can produce a perfect balanced and round stereo sound out of any monaural record I possess. It's no big deal, but some people think it is costly. Wrong!
The only cost is in time, not money. Even a kid could do it...
Becket, as said, is monaural and so are still many recent other DVD releases, from John Wayne Movies to early James Bond flicks and many others still.
I wonder if the studios have become purists, or simply plain lazy. With all the money people pay yearly, to go to the movies, buy DVDs, CD Soundtracks and various memorabilia, it is amazing to me that the studios haven't got the finances to improve their products and instead keep on producing dozens of other, new and rather stupid (see deja vu) movies each year.
Becket may not be a masterpiece like Ben-Hur or Lawrence of Arabia, but it is certainly not as utterly stupid as Dumb and Dumber and absolutely not as boring and wasteful as Pearl Harbor.
But again, hey, who am I to criticize?
I am just a voice in the desert.
A nobody, who buys DVDs instead of going to the movies.
Yet, I am also a stage director and an actor and know when the acting is good and performances are at their peak.
So take it from me. If you have the money to spare, buy the tape, waiting for the DVD to pop up. If not and you can wait so long, buy the DVD the day it appears on the horizon, but if it doesn't, you would have missed some piece of acting here.
You will never regret it...",1059782400,10,4026,4.501366120218579
227205,5,6300198731,"This is truly one of the greatest movies ever.  It is the story of King Henry II of England and his friendship and eventual conflict with his friend, Thomas Becket, whom he has appointed as the Archbishop of Canterbury.  The time is two generations after the Norman Conquest of England, and the bitterness between the Norman victors and the defeated Saxons is still very much alive as the central fact of English political life.
The story deals with the rivalry between Church and State.  King Henry sought to outmaneuver and check the growing power of the the Church, which was acting as a second, and perhaps more powerful, government.  Thomas Becket, his Chancellor and chief advisor, has warned him that in ten year's time there would only be one King--and it wouldn't be King Henry!  The King's plan: to appoint his closest friend, Thomas Becket, as the head of the Church of England.  But Becket feels honor-bound to fight for the Church and against King Henry.  The result is an absolute masterpiece tale of friendship, politics, and conflict.  This is a great story.
As if all of that isn't enough, Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton each in this movie turn in the greatest performances of their careers.  O'Toole is utterly engrossing as King Henry, who is dissolute, disciplined, sly, and scheming.  Burton is great as the highly intelligent, conflicted Thomas Becket, who seeks to reconcile his friendship and loyalty to his King with his honor and the duty he owes to the Church.  It is fun to argue which man turns in the better performance.  My vote goes to O'Toole.
The filming was done in England, and this adds an air of authenticity to the film.  This is a film that every collector will want to own and watch repeatedly over the years.  Now it needs to become available in the DVD format.",1058918400,2,1805,4.725239616613418
227206,5,6300198731,"The tale of Thomas Becket has had many incarnations over time. T.S. Eliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral' is but the most recent acclaimed literary treatment; each revisitation seems to draw new elements forth from the story. Edward Anhalt won the Oscar for best screenplay (adapted from other material) for this film. This film shows Henry and Thomas Becket roughly equal in age (at variance from history, for in this time the age difference of 15 years is practically a generational difference). Becket is shown as being a guide to Henry, but less from a master/pupil standpoint as it is a clever diplomatic with a utilitarian and almost Machiavellian sense about him. Henry is presented as coarse and unrefined, uneducated and in need of assistance, but historically this is unlikely.
Becket is played admirably by Richard Burton; Henry II is portrayed by Peter O'Toole. Both were nominated for the best actor Oscar, but neither won. In addition to these nominations and the best screenplay award, the film was nominated for nine other Oscars, running the list from costumes, music, directing, best picture, and a best supporting actor nod for John Gielgud, whose cameo as the King of France is rather interestingly presented.
Indeed, the movie has a remarkable realistic feel to it, particularly for a film from the 1960s, when cinema was as likely to portray stylised and idealistic images of the past. The sets are in bare stone with a minimum of ornamentation, as would have been the case in Plantagenet times; likewise, the ceremony around the royal person is much less grand, and the church rather grand, which is both accurate and serves to highlight the underlying conflict of the story in the film.
Becket is portrayed as a man of ambiguous loyalties -- a man of principle who has yet to find principles worthy of loyalty. Finally, in the role of archbishop, he finds a calling from the honour of God (and in so doing is not unlikely many priests who see their path to ordination as the means of spiritual grace; indeed, many are disappointed that the faith does not come with the office). Whether Thomas Becket actually experienced a spiritual conversion that made him a strong champion of the church, or in fact saw the power of the church as a means to an end of dominating the country, we will perhaps never know.
In the film, Becket is often disparaged as being a Saxon; this is perhaps overstated, given his Norman lineage, which is never hinted at in the film. While he does not come from Norman nobility, he is far from being a simple Saxon. Burton's portrayal of Becket shows the change from worldly chancellor to spiritual archbishop in unsubtle terms. Even so, there is an ambiguity that plays out marvelously in both his performance, and the reactions of the other characters who constantly question his sincerity.
O'Toole's performance is not as polished as Burton's; when he plays an older, wiser Henry II in 'The Lion in Winter' four years later, the acting is much more dramatic and effective. It perhaps goes without saying that Pamela Brown does not make the same impression on the screen as Eleanor of Aquitaine as Katherine Hepburn does in the later film, but Eleanor is an incidental character in Becket in any case.
Music in this film is not a prominent feature -- various trumpet and brass flourishes announce events or major scene changes in parts; a lot of chant (long before Gregorian chant achieved popular status) accompanies church scenes -- indeed, I credit this film for giving me my first real taste of Gregorian chant. The scene with Sian Phillips as Becket's love Gwendolyen is accompanied by period string instruments -- again, Phillips is a remarkable actress who is under-utilised in this performance.
Done in a flash-back manner, there is a resolution in the film -- Becket is dead, made a saint, honour is satisfied as the King does penance, and the people are happy. We know what is going to happen, but then, anyone with knowledge of history would likely know the story already. In fact, Henry's reign was rarely without challenge, but he was always powerful, and much more effective after Becket's death than before. Reigning for nearly twenty years after Becket's death, he left a very powerful Western European coalition of lands that soon fell apart, and embroiled England and France in war for centuries later. The tensions between church and state carry forward to this day; while the specifics of the challenges faces Becket and Henry II are very different from issues today, the principle of the relationship between church and state is far from definitively resolved.
Also, the side-line issue of class warfare and racial prejudice (teased out with subtle nuance between the Normans and Saxons, who, ironically, look exactly the same on the screen) are addressed in an interesting, pre-civil rights sort of manner. This issue is never resolved in the film, as indeed it wasn't in the 1960s, either.
This is an intriguing film, with great acting and great production values, and an interesting story that, even if not completely historically accurate, does not alter the history so much that it becomes a parody of the subject.",1054339200,10,5184,4.9122006841505135

227258,5,6300198731,"Historical films can be a snooze. History buffs pick apart the particulars, searching for accuracy. Action freaks complain of too much dialogue. But Peter Glenville's BECKET stands very tall; brilliant from every angle. Richard Burton was never better than as Thomas Becket, the rake, libertine, cronie of the king; the politico and gambler who was forced to wear, and bear, the mantle of Archbishop, finding himself inexplicably having to answer to a higher power than mere royality. Burton's performance bursts from the frame, as he galloped the gamut from whisper to roar, allowing us access through his eyes into the soul of a geniune historical treasure, Becket the man. Peter O'Toole was likewise magnificent as King Henry II; spoiled, manipulative, clever, randy, boisterous, bellering at his family; whoring and warring his way into history. The scene where Becket finally convinced Henry that he was taking the office of archbishop seriously struck to the heart of the King, and the plot. Henry, suddenly staggered, realized that now Becket was an advesary, and had to be punished. When mere punishment was not enough to bend Becket to the King's will, Henry had to force martyrdom on him. Anthony Quinn and Laurence Olivier did the play on Broadway, switching parts weekly. Wouldn't it have been incredible to have seen it ? Edward Anhalt's script was clever and intelligent, leaving us with a plethera of phrases, quotes, and thoughts that pierce through our viscera, and inhabit our hearts and minds. John Gielgud was, of course, very good as King Louis VII of France, who gave Becket temporary sanctuary. Donald Wolfit was a fine greasy politico bishop, a hypocrite, villian, and power monger. Look for the a young Edward Woodward in a small part. Undoubtedly, this film will always be residing on a top ten list for historical cinema.",1031788800,11,1848,5.082236842105263

Peter O`Toole was (pardon: still is) an outstanding actor and ""Becket"" is one of his best movies. He and Richard Burton team up to give the performance of their lives. O`Toole as King Henry II and Burton as his friend and boon-companion and later archbishop Thomas Becket.
Both were nominated for an Academy Award in a leading role and luckily neither of them won it. They both would have deserved the award equally.
Kate Hepburn once called Peter O'Toole a ""lousy picker"". To often did he choose to do the wrong (=bad) movies and not even his superb acting could save these movies. This time he was right, perfectly right.
Becket is a great movie and I would love to have it in my DVD library.",1029196800,22,845,4.602649006622516
227262,4,6300198731,"Becket is one of those films that seems to have become lost or forgotten over the years. Which is a pity because, while it is certainly not a great film, it is a film with much to recommend it. Of course, strictly speaking, it is not much of a film at all in a pure cinematic sense - more of a filmed play. It retains its theatrical structure and even has the feel of a play. Most of the exteriors look more like elaborate stage sets (with badly directed extras) than film settings. And the disappointing musical score sounds more like the loud ""we're changing the scenery"" cues often found in theatrical productions. But all of this may have been intentional because the real focus of the film is on the two central characters.
The story of Henry II and Thomas Becket, good friends who became enemies after the former made the latter Archbishop of Canterbury, is a familiar one. Just to make matters more interesting, one is a conquering Norman while the other is a vanquished Saxon. Hollywood loves that Norman/Saxon dynamic (see Robin Hood). Although more recent historical evidence suggests that, in reality, Becket was a minor Norman nobleman himself. Anyway...French playwright Jean Anouilh gave the tale the fresh insight and slightly sardonic interpretation of an outsider. He viewed Becket as more pragmatic - even pedantic - than holy and hinted that the relationship between King and Archbishop-to-be was a tad more intimate than mere friendship. Inevitably, the screenplay plays down this spin on events but thankfully retains much of the dialogue that sparks and flashes between the protagonists.
The real attraction of the film are the two star performances. The flamboyant Peter O'Toole, fresh from his introspective Lawrence of Arabia, is a revelation and rightly dominates every scene he's in. The fact that he never won an Oscar remains a scandal. Richard Burton is less flashy but just as solid. And yet, as with nearly every Burton performance, there is a touch of artificiality that jars, particularly in the early, bawdy scenes. There is a definite chemistry between the two actors, who were good friends, but I sometimes wish that Becket had been played by someone like Alan Bates or Albert Finney who could have made the character more full-bodied and believable. As it is, I have always been bothered by Becket's seemingly overnight change of personality. In one scene, he's pleading with Henry not to make him Archbishop - in the next, he's suddenly a serious cleric giving away all his possessions. Surely there is a scene missing there. (If they wanted to keep the running time down, they could have easily dispensed with the overplayed and unnecessary interlude with the Pope.)
With two such towering performances, the supporting cast has little chance of being noticed. But John Gielgud enjoys himself immensely as the wily King of France. Sian Phillips (Mrs O'Toole at the time) is quietly effective as Becket's Welsh mistress. But hammy Donald Wolfit as the scheming Bishop of London looks too much like a constipated granny to be menacing and Martita Hunt and Pamela Brown as Henry's mother and wife seem merely bitchy. The four English barons who eventually murder Becket are played by solid British character actors - you will know their faces but probably not their names. And what about something called Veronique Vendell - looking every inch a sixties sex kitten from a totally different film - who makes a mercifully brief appearance as a French tart.
The film has many wonderful moments, the best of which is Henry and Becket's final meeting - on horseback on a cold and windswept beach. The good parts of Becket are so good that you happily overlook and forgive the film's faults. If nothing else, it is worth seeing for the magnificent Peter O'Toole.",1022716800,,3792,4.917316692667707
227263,5,6300198731,"Becket is an extremely well done period drama that has not aged at all since it was made in 1964.  The literate and involving screenplay takes a few liberties with the facts, as far as they are known, but does and excellent job at conveying the characters and the political feel of the time.  The direction is always solid, and occasionally brilliant, but most importantly, Becket is flawlessly cast.  Supporting players John Gielgud, Donald Wolfit, Martita Hunt, and Pamela Brown turn in small but impressive performances, and ultimately help showcase Richard Burton's Thomas Becket, and Peter O'Toole's marvellous Henry.  Although Becket is technically the main character, it is Henry who provides the most memorable moments, and O'Toole is brilliant at portraying the slow descent of a fun-loving, if somewhat spoilt, young monarch into a strong and clever king, still somewhat spoilt, but much more dangerous, and also sadder.  The true genious of the film is its ability to make you sympathise completely with both characters although you are fully aware of their many faults.",1018224000,9,1081,5.189655172413793
227264,4,6300198731,"This 1964 film garnered twelve Academy Award nominations, and age has not diminished its power to engage the viewer. Fueled by two powerful performances that drive the entire film, that of Peter O'Toole as Henry II and that of Richard Burton as Thomas Becket, this history based drama explains the conflict that caused the assassinatiom and subsequent canonization of Becket.
Henry II, England's twelfth century Norman King, elevated Thomas Becket, a commoner and Saxon peasant, to the lofty position of Chancellor of England. Famous friends, they drank, caroused and wenched together. All was well between them until Henry takes it into his head to appoint Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury, the most powerful cleric in England, though Becket begs his friend not to do this. Ignoring the heartfelt plea of his friend, he makes it so, under the belief that this would indirectly bring the Catholic Church of England under his dominion and control.
Simultaneously both Archbishop and Chancellor, Becket became the most powerful man, secularly and religiously, in England with one fell swoop. This political move by Henry did not work out as he had envisioned, however, as Becket found himself in the position of being able only to render to the King that which was the King's and to God that which was God's. Becket took his position of Archbishop of Canterbury very seriously and was uncompromising in his view, a devotion to God that Henry had not bargained on. This created conflict between Becket and Henry. The friendship and love that had existed between them for so long, now quickly turned to bitter hate on Henry's part for what he perceived to be a betrayal of that friendship. For the first time in his life, Henry had a rival with whom he could not compete: God.
This was to lead to a battle of wills between the two that would culminate in a tragedy that would become memorialized for all time. This film attempts to capture the events that led up to Becket's eventual martyrdom. It succeeds masterfully. A somewhat hammy Peter O'Toole is terrific as the selfish King Henry II. A more restrained Richard Burton is compelling as the troubled and angst ridden Becket, who ultimately chooses his devotion to God over the dictates of his King and friend. This is a beautifully filmed and superlative historical drama with wonderful performances contributed by the supporting cast. Though somewhat stagey at times, it does not fail to fully engage the viewer. All in all, it is a period piece well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's film collection.",1009065600,4,2569,4.935334872979214
227265,4,6300198731,"This 1964 film deals with the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, after his old drinking buddy, King Henry II, famously asked, ""Who will rid me of this turbulent priest!?""  Its been a matter of great debate whether Henry actually meant to order the murder of his old friend and, to me at least, this film almost makes the case that Henry's words were just the impulsive, possibly drunken words of a rather immature man thrust, by heredity, into a position of power he was not yet ready for.
One might think that the political murder of a priest in a pre-Reniassance England would make for a rather dry, humorless film. Luckily, Becket proves them wrong.  Though director Peter Glenville was not a flashy stylist and occasionally does allow the film to become a bit stagey, he was also a wonderful director of actors and manages to get wonderful lead performances from a young Peter O'Toole (as Henry) and even from the normally diffident Richard Burton (as Becket).  When the film begins, it feels very much like a comedy.  When we first meet Becket and Henry, they are two young, spoiled friends who spend most of their time drinking and wenching.  Though, as expected, O'Toole is hilarious as the fun-loving monarch, even Burton manages a few slyly sardonic line readings.  Years later, in an interview with David Letterman, O'Toole would admit that both the lead actors were drunk during the majority of the shooting and basically just having a grand old time of it.  Their sense of fun in these early scenes is easily translatable to the audience and its hard not to like these two immoral rogues and, perhaps, to even secretly want to find a time machine and go hang out with them.  O'Toole and Burton were friends in real life and the mutual affection the two shared is especially obvious and endearing and serves to make the film's later events all the more tragic.
The film takes a serious turn when the previous Archbishop dies and Henry, seeing a way to make things easier for himself, appoints his old friend Becket to the position.  However, once installed, Becket discovers his soul.  He becomes a rare example of a man who power does not corrupts but instead serves to purify.  As a leader, Becket discovers his lost integrity and tragically, this leads to his own martyrdom and later canonization.  Fittingly, this man redeemed by the church (and who would guess that this would be the premise of such a hilarious, entertaining, and downright fun film?) becomes patron saint of the clergy.
That said, this isn't really a film about religion as much as its about friendship and the price one pays for taking a stand.  This is one of the best historical films I have ever seen and should be seen by anyone interested in either a good story or just some of the best acting ever put on screen.  There's something beautiful about a film that surprises you by defying your expectations and Becket is a great example of one of those films.",1003017600,153,2966,4.7007722007722
227266,4,6300198731,"An inspiring story of Thomas A. Becket leading from the days of his youth as friends with the King to being assassinated as Archbishop of Canterbury.  Becket is, however, more a movie about the struggle of power between church and state than about just one man.  Originally appointed chancellor, after being friends with King Henry II, Becket is loyal to his master and obeys his wishes.  So, when the position of Archbishop of Canterbury opens up, Henry II, sensing the rift developing between church and state over taxation of the clergy, appoints Thomas Becket to the job, hoping to be the puppeteer from the background.  This time, however, Becket was no longer able to do his king's bidding as he was now answerable to higher powers than that of the king, whereas before, Henry II was his one true master.  Eventually relations become so hot-tempered between Henry and Thomas that Thomas is forced to flee to France, where he remains for seven years.  Upon his return he is greeted by four barons and their swords at the altar of Canterbury.  And to add to all of this, there is an underlying theme regarding the class status of Becket, while although a prudent ruler, he is of Saxon background.

Thomas Becket is man with a few faces.  First, we see Becket as a loyal servant of the court whose heart cannot allow him to force a Saxon peasant to his bedchamber.  He gives orders to leave the girl professing, ""Honor is a private matter within--It's an idea, and every man has his own version of it.""  However, and this disturbed me, when the same Saxon is brought to the palace as a gift from the king, Thomas, although at first answers, ""No [do not take of your clothes],"" does eventually sleep with her during the night.  Another side of Becket is shown once he is appointed archbishop.  Abandoning his loyalties to the king Becket claims, ""The honor of God,"" a much more important issue.  Henry II, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional character.  He starts out a glutton, caring more about carnal affairs than affairs of state, and he ends up a glutton, only a broken one.  He is despotic by nature and refuses to give any weight to those of power other than himself.  ""I am your King!"" must have been said a dozen times in the movie serving to accent on the struggle he creates between church and state and Henry basically orders Becket's death when he asks, ""Will no-one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"".

I found this movie very pleasurable to watch.  The passion in Becket's eyes must be the best attribute Richard Burton brought to the show for I was mesmerized.  I was, however, slightly confused with some of the decisions Becket made, such as his choosing to sleep with the peasant Saxon.  Nevertheless, when Becket is faced by his attackers and slowly dies on the steps of the altar, you can't help but feel that what he was doing was right, was just.  Even so, in the end I was left wondering how Henry turned this matter around and made himself seem an honorable king to the people.",1000166400,,3008,4.593632958801498

This is NOT 2 1/2 hours of Beckett and the king discussing the separation of church and state.  This is almost one of the best movies I have ever seen.  What qualifies it was the brutal, bloody ending.  I am pissed at Burton for doing it.  I feel my trust was betrayed.  As I felt about Gregory Peck doing The Omen 40 years ago.  Had expected from him some intellectual, supernatural hocus pocus.  The ending to Beckett (though I already knew how it ended) was a jolt and the blood made it worse.  It was pretty mild by today's standards, but I'm still upset.  Anyway, the story, incidentals of plot twists, Peter O'Toole's fantastic acting (everybody's acting was good, he just had the most to do) - I thought it was a great movie.  I think now (after Camelot, Virginia Woolf, Hamlet and this) that Burton was a personality, not so much an actor.  The personalities of the characters in this movie were so clear and distinct, I think this more than anything else made it good.  Maybe when I get over the climax, I'll put it with my favorite DVDs and watch it again someday.  I kept thinking while I watched it that I would soon watch it again.
