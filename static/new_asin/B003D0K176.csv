Though definitely NOT suitable for kids, even ones who are well versed in horror or zombie movies.",1413072000,,180,4.142857142857143
8394592,5,B003D0K176,"I am a huge supporter of Indie horror, as I am a long time horror film film-geek.  But, the thing is, a lot of, if not most of Indie horror is cluttered with terrible acting, horrible directing and well, just all-over crapiness.  COME GET SOME is an exception.  This film is pretty well put together for an Indie - it's got good sound, well directed and the editing is pretty sharp.

My biggest problem with these types of Indie horror productions is the fact they choose to waste everyone's time by hiring actors and actresses that are so awful to watch; it really either ruins the film altogether or makes the film a joke and a piece of crap you toss on only to make fun of it with your friends at a drunken party.  The film is carried excellently by the lead played by Steven A. Grainger.  Some of the other actors or actresses are at times trying a little too hard to be tough and it takes you out of the moment (actually only one actress I can think of, anyway), BUT, I enjoyed this film a great deal and besides Grainger, I dug the actress who looks like Christina Lindberg (They Call Her One Eye) - the girl's name escapes me at the moment.  The hillbillies and Feds did a pretty stand up job too.

Another thing is Indie horror - the script/dialogue!!!!  Usually pretty bad stuff, but the dialogue here is not just believable, its sun, funny and well written.

All in all I gotta say Grainger is like one of these actors, no matter who they play, you like `em. - Like Paul Giamatti, Bruce Campbell or someone of that ilk - you'll see `em in anything they do, because they are likeable, goofy and highly watchable characters.

The special effects weren't the greatest, but the director made some good off screen shots effectively, which I enjoyed more then seeing no-budget special effects being done.

If you're a fan of Indie horror, I'd buy this and check it out.  These guys got a lot of potential and it's not a bad inclusion into your DVD collection.",1286409600,,1963,4.404432132963989
8394593,5,B003D0K176,"Ok first this is an independent film with a small budget it is in black and white but did any of that hurt this sadly overlooked zombie comedy NO it did not, what it lacks in polished multimillion dollar effect and overpaid name actors it make up for it with heart, originality and whitt.
Shot in and around North Carolina,The slapstick and jokes land and the script by Griscom and Grainger if it was their first is surprisingly fresh and funny. The makeup effects are old-school( think original NOTLD) and pay homage to the dawn of the dead( look for the shirt the kitchen zombie is wearing) ,evil dead( poster hanging on wall and well the title:)) and many nods to other movies and this is clearly made by fans for fans and the fun the cast is having clearly shows on screen.
OK the story is The government release zombies on a small town populated with southern rednecks and protected by four women(summer,skylar,ashyln,christa)with the zombies running amuck The powers that be call screw-up agent the Last Resort Man as tries to clean it up the mess of H.U.D.S. (Human Undead Defense Service).
Steven A. Grainger did a really nice job as the Elvis obsessed Last Resort Man sometimes it seems like he was channeling a young Bruce Campbell and he had me sold the whole time.
So if you enjoy zombie comedy do yourself a favor and check this gem out its in the line of NOTLD,Evil Dead,Shaun of The Dead, Die and Let Live,Dance of the Dead ect.",1276300800,,1443,4.553846153846154
