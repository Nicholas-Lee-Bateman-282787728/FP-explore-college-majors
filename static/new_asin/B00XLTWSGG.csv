7170913,1,B00XLTWSGG,this was a Blu-ray and digital copy purchase and nowhere does it say that you have to be in Ireland or the UK to redeem the digital copy.  So I was greatly disappointed that only the movies worked and not the digital copies.  Still a good deal for the price but upsetting at the same time,1511654400,,288,4.125

7170935,4,B00XLTWSGG,"These three films are a good example of how often a series can go from pretty good to mediocre at best. They're all entertaining if one does not think too hard about plot, especially in the last two films. All three have well done CGI dinosaurs (I still startle at the Raptors) and at least one character from the first film to provide some consistency.
In my opinion the first film is the best while the second has HUGE plot hole issues throughout its middle and end. The third film is almost too similar to the first for me to really like it.",1488153600,,544,4.29126213592233

7170947,5,B00XLTWSGG,"The details are outstanding in the Blu-ray version. Various scenes illustrate the clarity and quality of this product.
.
FACIAL CLOSEUPS: You can visually see the hair studs, moles, forehead lines, and sweat of the actors. Dr. Alan Grant has a pimple on his right cheek with one or two short hair stubbles surrounding it.
.
WATER POOL: Trees, bushes, and shrubs are reflected in the water with small waves disturbing and distorting the color images. You can also see the varied colored stones under the shallow water.
.
DIGGING SCENE: Dust and individual sand particles with their various shades and tones are on the ground. Blown by the oncoming helicopter, they stuck on the shirts and jeans of the actors.
.
THE MULTI-MILLIONAIRE: The individual hairs on his white beard are displayed with their different tones and shades.",1469318400,,826,4.9496402877697845
7170948,3,B00XLTWSGG,"Only indication of the issue is buried in the middle of the Product Details: ""Studio: Universal Pictures UK"".  That's it.  I've NEVER had to scour every single word of an Amazon item listing for a movie to find out whether it was for the US market.

Discs are region-free, so they WORK in US players.  The Ultraviolet codes that came with my set for the online digital versions, however, did *NOT* work, which is quite annoying.  I would have found another, US seller, or delayed my purchase until I could get it from one.",1468627200,3,522,4.51063829787234

7170951,4,B00XLTWSGG,"This is a wonderful collection of the first to third in the series of Jurassic Park movies. These still pack a punch for scares and suspense
in dinosaur filled islands, not to mention a brief stint in San Diego... These will awe the little ones, and still have the ability to entertain the whole family. There are a few brief moments of down right "" I need to look the other way"" shocks along most all these gems.
These are a MUST HAVE for most every family's library of movies!",1458172800,7,478,4.322222222222222

7170958,4,B00XLTWSGG,"Great collection. Love these movies. I did get the blu-Ray  + digital copy and I was a little disappointed. The digital copy won't download because the set that was delivered to me only allows download in the UK, I live in the US so that was a little upsetting seeing how I often travel and would have liked to have these on my I pad. I wish I would have known and maybe would have bought it from a different seller so I could have gotten the digital download for the US",1447545600,8,470,4.108695652173913

7170966,5,B00XLTWSGG,"I had never seen any of these until my wife bought the trilogy and I love each one. Some people say they're not realistic, but who wants realistic over fun. They are great movies with plenty of action and lots of terror and suspense. Great fun.",1439769600,8,244,4.326086956521739
