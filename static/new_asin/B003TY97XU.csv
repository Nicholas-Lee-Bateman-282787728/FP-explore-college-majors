8405523,5,B003TY97XU,"Tim Carmell is a humble person, accomplished martial artist and great writer and translator (watch an interview with him on utube) who dedicated his life to pursuit of martial arts and spreading the wisdom. This book is about Chigong / Nei Gong health exercises rooted in Xing Yi that people familiar with Chigong or Tai Chi might find similar. A real pearl, if you are interested in improving your health, highly recommended. You might want to accompany it with DVD by the same author.",1504656000,,486,4.7976190476190474
8405524,4,B003TY97XU,"This video is a supplement to the book ""Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development"" by Dan Miller and Tim Cartmell (ISBN-10: 0865681740).  It's a barebones presentation intended to clarify the exercises presented in the book.  After a quick introduction, you get an easy to follow, silent demonstration of the exercises.  There's no menu, no chapters, and the whole program runs under thirty minutes.  By itself, this isn't really a good buy.  However, with the book, it's an excellent way to learn a life-changing, little known internal energy exercise.  Recommended to serious practitioners of the Martial Arts and/or Yoga.",1422403200,4,661,5.3076923076923075
8405525,3,B003TY97XU,"I have had a copy of Tim Cartmell's ""Xingyi Nei Gong"" book (companion to this DVD) for a while and have always liked it for more than just the exercises in it.  It is very informative reading on the subject of Xingyi nei gong and also includes some fascinating details about Wang Ji Wu, a famous Xingyi practitioner and developer of the 16 nei gong exercises in the book and DVD.
After a bit of hesitation, I bought the DVD.  I had long sought a more detailed demo of the movements described in the book, because I felt I wasn't doing them correctly.

The prior review is correct about this dvd being short on a soundtrack, or motivational music (LOL) if that's what you're hoping for.  But intentionally so I'm sure.  Except for Tim's initial introduction at the beginning of the DVD this is a pure demonstration of each of the exercises with close-ups and wide shots of Tim performing the movements.  IMHO The DVD is a bit brief to be charging $35.00 a pop for it- plus postage. But I'm sure the cost is not all about keeping gas in Tim's Ferrari.  There is likely a bit of ""middle men"" expense involved I might not be aware of.  :-)

Overall I'm glad I purchased the dvd.  It DID help ""simplify"" things a bit, for me anyway.  :-)

If you have the book and want to get some ""fine tuning"" to the movements, this DVD might be worth your $$$.",1326931200,10,1341,4.32
8405526,2,B003TY97XU,A  dvd copy of the formerly released Video neither of which has sound after the brief introduction of  thanks for buying.  No instruction oral or written; just a soundless demonstration.,1326412800,4,186,5.133333333333334
8405527,3,B003TY97XU,"First of all let me say I have the utmost respect for the authors.
The book is excellent. However, the video adds little insight (At least it didn't for  me). The video simply demonstrates the 16 exercises described in the book. There are no further explanations or elaborations. Unless you have no
familiarity at all with slow qi gong (taiji-like) movements the video will put you to sleep. The explanations in the book if followed carefully are adequate. In the video the demonstrator silently goes through the 16 exercises with approximately 15-20 repetitions of each movement (Why go through the whole set with 15+ repetitions? The video would be far more useful with a few {3-5 reps} and further explanations. Basically, all the reps are just to fill tape {In my opinion}) I personally would have like to have seen some of the spear, standing, ""bagua-like stepping"", and ""before bed"" exercises shown and mentioned in the book demonstrated and elaborated on in the video.  Having said all that. If you are an absolute beginner/neophyte/""clueless about Qigong"", the video will be an excellent reference to see the movements actually carried out. Those with even a little experience with qigong will get little out of the video.",1089763200,,1230,4.995121951219512
