7848554,4,630347926X,"For most artists, making a music video has been nothing but a true art format. For some of them, it really seems to be displayed as oversaturated, and thensome in the other direction. For R.E.M., they truly have made the video age unlike anything else. No matter what seems to be popular out there, the videos they've conjured up are truly one in a million. They have made videos that can make up laughs, and produce a few tears in the process. That absolutely came in the case during the 1990's.
The VHS music video collection, Parallel, in a collection of R.E.M.'s videos from 1992-1995. Only two of R.E.M.'s records were highlighted on this mainstake of collections, Monster and Automatic For The People. The videos are completly full of spice and just completely imaginative and real. Some of these videos just show so much of their gfreat talents and art formats, like Everybody Hurts, Bang & Blame, and Strange Currencies. Everytime I see these videos, I truly am reminded of how artistic Michael Stipe, Bill Berry, Mike Mills, and Peter Buck are truly dominant. There are just so much to offer here, and many R.E.M. fans can taste that a mile away. While many fans might be dissapointed videos for Stand and the acclaimed Losing My Religion aren't here, it really doesn't make a difference here anyway, because R.E.M. truly stands the test of time.
It is just a shame the music videos from ""Corporate Pop"" seems to take over this plagued industry today, with Milli Vanilli Jennifer Lopez, and ""Manufactured Teen Pop"" acts like Britney Spears. You still have to note of R.E.M.'s musical ability and talent. It is just a shame that many people have written them off these past few years, but their talent and innovation will truly stand these tests of time.",1067904000,,1762,4.761437908496732
