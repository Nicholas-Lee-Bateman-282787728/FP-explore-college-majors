7887281,3,6305280134,"Remember those days of hormone-laden male adolescence when you snuck into the living room in the middle of the night, making sure you didn't rouse your dozing parents, just to watch Cinemax? And this movie was just the thing you were lookin' for, wasn't it? Hell, you probably even had a videotape handy to record it for future reference, din't'cha? Hey, don't you start fibbin' to me, boy! And just what was it about this flick that enticed you?
Acting? Feh, who needs it?
Plot? Yeah, right! Like you were paying any attention to the story at all!
Nope- you know what it was that kept you watchin'... nudies! T & A and softcore scenes! Gave you kinduva funny feelin', didn't it? Yep, it sure was a memorable experience to say the least! I know it was for me. So fear not- ""Desert Passion"" features plenty of T & A and softcore moments, with very little real acting and a less-than-original nudie flick plot. Wow- yet another version of the ""women being used as sex slaves"" story! Where have I seen that before...?
For those who consider DVD extras for such movies overkill, you're in luck! This skin-show cuts right to the chase... no trailers, filmographies, or chapter searches to get in the way of your enjoyment. Just hit PLAY to fire 'er up! Ah, sweet simplicity...

7887282,4,6305280134,"Lots of nudity and pretty women.  Some parts of it are slow.  The writer created a very futuristic interesting concept, but it seems like it was written in a hurry - not enough time to delve into the characters'  motivations.  Beginning actors.  Whoever wrote it has potential.  The  director has potential, too.",915235200,6,312,4.884615384615385
