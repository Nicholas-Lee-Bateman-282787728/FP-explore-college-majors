Composing The Beatles Songbook, however, is not one of them.  The panel is first rate: people who were close friends of the Beatles during the sixties and people who are ""experts"" on the Beatles and their music.  I particularly like the diversity of opinions on the panel.  Some seem more partial to Paul's style and some seem more partial to John's style so it's not biased towards either of them.  If you're a serious fan of the Beatles' music, you have to check out this series!",1262044800,2,610,4.716981132075472
3598014,5,B001G9CNJK,"I was truely impressed with the two DVDs on the history of Paul and John's writing experience. I am a true Beatle fan fourever and have hundreds of Beatles items and including DVDs, CDs, and memoriablia. There are truely some facts that I had heard about but was not quiet sure if it was true or not. The people that are in these DVDs are professionals, friends who were around them at all times, and people who know music, which include musicians, professors of music etc. These DVDs are for true Beatle fans who want to know more. Excellent, well done.",1246147200,,554,4.4950495049504955
3598015,4,B001G9CNJK,"I was truly impressed by this review of the Beatles music, feeling the impact of their music to this day.  Had to laugh at some of the comments of these experts on occasion, though, as some of the songs were just plain simple songs that were written on the sly, with no real intent to have all of these multiple meanings.

Still, it was refreshing to hear these insiders look at the songs from their vantage.  If you want an intellectual lift on your favorite Beatles music, I highly recommend this informative DVD.",1231891200,6,515,4.516129032258065
3598016,4,B001G9CNJK,"""Composing the Beatles Songbook - Lennon & McCartney 1966 - 1970"" is a documentary exploring the partnership, music, and impact of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as composers during their immensely creative period. The DVD incorporates rare footage, classic performances, and interviews with friends of the pair as well as with Beatles historians.

We learn the hows, whens, and whys of such Beatles songs as ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""Hey Jude,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Revolution,"" ""Get Back,"" and ""I Am the Walrus."" Seldom has the genesis of pop songs been put to such careful scrutiny. For those who remember those years firsthand, this DVD will provide both nostalgia and the back stories of the songs of youth.

 For Beatles fans, the information contained on this DVD will shed light on the genesis of the groups well-known classics. The archival footage of The Beatles performing is worth the price. Its both thrilling, and a bit sad, to see them in their glory years, when nearly every release became a hit. The documentary also makes clear why these four guys, together, made music magic.

For those too young to recall those years, the DVD will shed light on the combination of talent, artistry, experimentation, and marketing that made the Beatles such an unparalleled phenomenon.",1226880000,,1289,5.123809523809523

8304539,5,B001G9CNJK,This is probably my favorite documentary one the duo and I highly recommend this series of three. Only wish there was one on George.,1415664000,,132,4.541666666666667
8304540,5,B001G9CNJK,"This is the second of two films in this series, the first film focusing on the Lennon/McCartney songbook through Rubber Soul.  For some reason, this one just works better.  Perhaps because the songs the interviewees choose to analyze are more interesting, but regardless I enjoyed this one more.  Same great cast of journalists, same insightful comments.  This is a very specific film in that it literally just goes from song to song to song, minimal biograhpical information.  So, perfect if you need a fresh perspective on some of the more famous Beatles songs from the latter part of their career.",1395273600,,600,4.96
8304541,5,B001G9CNJK,"Following on from the DVD which dealt with the early years of the Lennon-McCartney writing partnership, from the late 1950's up to the mid 1960's, this second documentary deals with the period from the psychadelic mid-Sixties up to the last album of ""Abbey Road."" This has the same panel as the first DVD - so Barry Miles, Nigel Williamson, Johnny Rogan, Chris Ingham, Peter Doggett, etc. These are a very interesting group of people who have written about the Beatles, musicians,music journalists, and comprise a panel who actually have insightful observations to make. You may not agree with them all, but they are valid points.

1966 saw the end of touring and the beginning of the Beatles as largely a band who performed in the studio. There is the masterpiece of ""Revolver"" and the singles ""Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane,"", ""Sgt Peppers,"" ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" the ""White Album,"" the disaster of ""Let It Be,"" and ""Abbey Road."" Along the way, the documentary discusses the emergence of Lennon and McCartney's distinct songwriting styles and personalities, the death of Brian Epstein, the avante-garde and Yoko Ono. There are also the influence of other factors, especially drugs, on the band and a discussion of how the two were seen as having different styles and strengths. Yet, although Lennon was seen as a rocker, he produced ballads like ""Julia,"" while McCartney - often dismissed as a writer of love songs, is more than capable of the hardest rock song, such as ""Helter Skelter.""

There are two more DVD's in this series, which tackles the solo work of the two greatest popular songwriters of all time. If they are anything like as interesting and insightful as the two programmes which look at the Beatles work, they will be well worth watching. Highly enjoyable and very interesting, these are a good - and unbiased - insight into both the music and personalities of Lennon and McCartney.",1394064000,,1910,4.984326018808777
8304542,4,B001G9CNJK,"This follows directly on from Part 1 that comprises the Beatles Songbook 1957-65. There is some material repeated from that part but it does serve a purpose in contextualizing what came after.

So we `travel' from Revolver right through to Abbey Road and witness the travails and eventual demise as a group of this cultural phenomenon. Once again, there are some truly fascinating insights into the particular chemistry of the pairing that changed the world of popular music forever and the contributors, some of whom were personally known to the Beatles, all appear to be knowledgeable and have interesting things to say about arguably one of the greatest and most prolific song writing partnerships in popular music history. Once again, Dylan's influence is felt, but so too are the cultural influences that McCartney was newly experiencing through his relationship with Jane Asher.

As for Part 1; for anyone interested in the history of popular music, how genius works in practice or, perhaps, how the nature of collaboration - in comparison with a solo artist; e.g. Brian Wilson, produces works of art, this second DVD in the series will be an invaluable resource. There are one or two questionably assertions; e.g. that concept albums effectively began with `Pet Sounds' - Sinatra had been making them since he began his collaboration with Riddle. It's also somewhat disappointing that Harrison's burgeoning contribution to the songwriting effort is not give more prominence - but then nothing's perfect!

It may be hard for anyone not from the era to understand what all the fuss is/was about but the Beatles created two things - music and magic: for this fan, at least; whenever I hear the first bars of almost any Beatles song I'm transported back to that time, which now seems, so long ago. Their music demands my (not entirely uncritical) allegiance in a way almost no other musical act does.",1383868800,,1903,5.015822784810126
8304543,5,B001G9CNJK,"Being a life long fan of the Beatles, I stay in search of worthy content to view and help me gain knowledge of four men that helped me grow up. There is much shabby work for sale in the market that should never see the light of day and sometimes we are prey to people who sell junk to take your money. This DVD was a solid investment and a work worth watching repeatedly. This disc is full of insight into the Beatles music, their style of song writing and interesting details into the minds of Paul, John, George & Ringo from artists they worked with intimately. Its very seldom you come across this type of work and have it pull you in the minute it starts. I would have paid twice the price for it and Im tight with my money. The first thing I did after watching it was get back on Amazon and purchase a second copy for my sister who is an even bigger fan of the Beatles than me if thats possible. It was a treat sharing it with her after she had watched it because we compared notes about the film and talked of its detail. Fabulous addition to my collection, I am currently lining up the others in the series for purchase. If you love getting into the creativity of the artist, this should be a part of your collection.",1309392000,3,1224,4.168776371308017
8304544,2,B001G9CNJK,"There were only two people in this documentary who demonstrated first hand knowledge of the subject; Barry Miles and Klaus Voorman.

Other than Klaus and Barry the DVD featured the usual odd assortment of people a couple of degrees removed; critics, musicians and teachers looking to contribute to the subject and occasionally succeeding, but more often following their own opinions to the point of contradicting better informed sources.

All in all it's hard to know whether to recommend this to anyone.  If you don't know much about the Beatles and the songwriting process that supported them, this film will not help you.  The level of collaboration that existed between all four, even when they were fighting, is totally down played in this film in an effort to create a narrative that contrasts the songwriting of John and Paul.  If you do know enough to understand the difference between this narrative and what others closer to the source have said then you're bound to be frustrated at wading through the seemingly endless reels of ill-informed conjecture to get at the new pieces of information.  If you are hoping to hear Klaus on the subject (as I was) please note that he is featured very little in the film.",1285286400,7,1220,4.869565217391305
