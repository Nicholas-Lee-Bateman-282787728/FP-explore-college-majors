I'll be the first! I don't know what this (VHS) really is. There is no product information that I can see. When I inlarge the image I can see that it is John wayne's the Alamo, (but what is Part 2) ? what is the Alamo part two ? Is it the missing thirty minutes they butchered from the original Movie..and if so wher did it come from, how did they get it, why haven't I seen it before? I don't see any way to contact the seller, to ask. I'm trying to find the full length 202 minute original movie, not the butchered 182 or the 187 minute verson. Every time I see the 187 minute version I allways feel left out! I remember seeing the intire 202 minute movie on T.V it was in two parts, way back when they showed real movies on T.V. I was nine the first time and eleven the second time in 1974 It was long enough were they had to split it up in two parts on tv. So I ask again, what is the Alamo part 2 ?? (I know I'm not the only one who is looking for the 202 minute version of this great film) I've read many posts all over the internet of people looking and wondering does it exsist? If I see it I'll buy it!
I would like to see other people coment on this......",1252886400,,1171,3.8833333333333333
