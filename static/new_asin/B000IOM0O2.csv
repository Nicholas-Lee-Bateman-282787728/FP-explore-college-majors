8146556,5,B000IOM0O2,"Buffett & Gates Go Back To School (PBS Home Video) is sponsored by the University of Nebraska foundation and  features both men giving a candid and informative presentation. Additionally, I noticed that both of them took the time to inject humor in many of their questions raised by the University of Nebraska students. The following also includes tidbits about both men during the video:
Buffett has license plates that say thrifty.
A $1,000 Berkshire Investment In 1965 would be worth about $5.5 million today.
Buffett took a Dale Carnegie public speaking course in 1951.
Gates receives millions of e-mails per day. Most of it is spam.
Buffett still lives in the same house he bought in 1957 for $31,500.00 (thirty one thousand and five hundred U.S.  dollars and zero cents).
Both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have three children.
Please know that there is much more interesting tidbits and information that are packed into the dvd.  Reluctantly, I admit that Ive obviously only included a brief sampler, due to writing this in a rush (before getting ready for work).  Buffett & Gates Go Back To School is great for those who like to watch inspirational and informative content.",1386028800,,1181,4.94949494949495

8146560,5,B000IOM0O2,"I purchased this tape out of curiosity. I liked it so much that I had my husband watch it. He borrowed it and showed it to all his MBA classes. When I retrieved it, I took it with me when I visited our seven grandkids. The youngest is only four but all the others, including the seven year old,as well as their parents, enjoyed the banter, words of wisdom and interaction between the two richest men in the world. The tape is a pleasure to watch, the college kids,impressive and I look forward to future discussions between these two men.",1227312000,2,538,4.39

The dynamics between the men is interesting.  I've seem many interviews of both men, and I find this one to be the most open, entertaining, and informative.",1210032000,5,357,5.228070175438597

8146563,5,B000IOM0O2,"Two successful business men. From entirely different approaches they have made themselves successful. Interestingly, their values, and business ethics are similar. Their concern for the future has melded them into a common crusade to make the world a little better. There is a bigger difference between the fresh new college students who ask questions of these successful men, than between the two men.",1174608000,4,402,5.396825396825397
