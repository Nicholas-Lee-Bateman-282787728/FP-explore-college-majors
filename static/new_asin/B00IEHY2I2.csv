8641582,5,B00IEHY2I2,"This documentary gives viewers and extraordinary look inside Pakistan's runaway youth and their struggles in determining what is right, wrong, and their belief in God.

8641586,3,B00IEHY2I2,"What was shown was worth five stars, but what they failed to show brings it down to three. They failed to substantiate through interviews, research or data the level of young male isolation, abuse and poverty and the resulting outcomes within Pakistan. Out of ""courtesy"" and privacy they did not show many scenes, such as inside homes, that would have led to a better and more objective understanding of conditions from those in the rest of the world who view this documentary. They also, for similar reasons, did not show film of females who as we all know undergo much more severe abuse.",1400198400,2,589,4.728155339805825

8641590,5,B00IEHY2I2,"It was the preview of the film that caught my attention. This movie inspired a lot of empathy on my part for these lost boys in Pakistan. The boys grow up in a world that is so different than mine. It was so hard to see them cry and long for home. I loved the immediate message in the beginning of the movie by the man who started the orphanage. He says that he is an ordinary man who came from ordinary people and if you want to find him look among them. He helps these boys out of the kindness of his heart, wanting nothing in return. I loved this documentary. In the end I was left irrevocably moved. It made me want to be a better person in general. One person can make a huge difference in someone's life.",1394668800,,710,4.042553191489362
