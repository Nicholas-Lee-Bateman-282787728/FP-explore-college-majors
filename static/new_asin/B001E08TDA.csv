3544715,5,B001E08TDA,"i can not think of any phrase that would sound impressive enough to describe how great this production is. not only is the dancing of all the performers superb, but the acting skill is equally on par.the sets and costumes mesh perfectly with the ""feel"" of this production. technically, the lighting is perfect. the picture is crisp and sharp. the editing is as close, i think to perfect as you can get. when a particular scene utilizes numerous personnel miming/dancing different things the camera will pan away to allow you to see the scene as a whole rather than just focusing on the main character(s). i have seen other productions of giselle but this one is special because it gave me a whole new appreciation for the story. i have heard it said that the devil is in the details and that is surely the case here. the attention to detail in everything is what pushes this production way ahead of just about every ballet i have on video.  the character portrayal has a richness and depth that is among the best i have ever seen in any production, recorded or live. alina cojocoru is phenomenal as giselle. i'd heard much of her but have only seen her in the royal ballets the nutcracker which i liked but i knew was not the perfect vehicle to showcase her talents. from the moment she stepped out of the cottage in giselle i was mesmerized. she has such a fluid movement, a ""way"" about her that reminded me of baryshnikov. ( i know its a strange comparison but for some reason as i was watching her baryshnikov kept poping into my brain.) she translates so much emotion but in such a subtle way. as another reviewer said ""she lingers long in the mind."" johan kobborg as loys/albrecht was very, very impressive, cleary setting the bench mark for this role. the regal caddishness, the moment of romantic clarity, the remorse, the sorrow and repentance all portrayed just perfect. neither over or under acted.  and i would have to say the same  applies to martin harvey as hillarion. i liked that rugged macho attitude he brought to the role. his portrayal brought more attention to the role of hillarion then any other i'd ever seen. the second act had at moments, a genuine ghostlyness to it, even creepy in a way. marianela nunez as myrtha was perfect. she had that blank, see thru you stare down pat. and for what its worth this production has some of the best looking dancers ever assembled on a stage. the royal orchestra conducted by boris gruzin was perfectly in sync with the action on stage. the sound for this production is also excellent. in conclusion; this giselle gave me a renewed appreciation for this ballet. it is certainly one i will watch again and again. this is truly five stars without reservation.",1238889600,8,2721,4.606185567010309
3544716,5,B001E08TDA,I got so impressed with this marvelous ballet performance. It has all what I always demand to hear and see of the art dance. The Royal Ballet keeps its superb and challenge level and ranks among the greatest ballets companies of the world. Principal roles dance so fine with grace and unique art of prefection and good taste. The sound of the Royal Opera House Orchestra is quite good balanced and very fine. This is the best Gisselle ballet performance I ever seen and heard up to date.,1237680000,2,487,4.545454545454546
3544717,5,B001E08TDA,"This ballet is wonderful. The Royal Ballet knows how to do a first rate performance. As such, one would watch this over and over. I recommend it heartily.",1237161600,2,154,4.535714285714286
3544718,5,B001E08TDA,"Adolphe Adam wrote the music for this Romantic libretto (Saint-Georges and T.Gautier)and choreographers Perrot and Coralli created this 2 act ballet for Carlotta Grisi,in 1841. She had been his pupil,and having become his mistress, gave him a daughter,in 1837. They were never to marry. Later on,Coralli would say that he alone had choreographed it...!
One of the most celebrated ballets ,perhaps the best known and represented one,suffered various revisions - Marius Petipa,as in the present Giselle, (he was the elder brother to Lucien Petipa who had also been the first Albrecht),Nureyev,Grigorovich,etc., but never lost its luminous aura with the ingredients so dear to Romanticism(Death,the Night ,Fate ,doomed Love and Madness (Walter Scott,Gothe,etc).
Every ballerina's dream(as in last year poignant documentary on a ""corps de ballet"" dancer - Vronique Doisneau),has been the glory of several dancers such as Essler, Chauvir, Karsavina, Spessivtseva, Fracci,Ulanova,Markova...
This said,romanian Alina Cojocaru,star of the Royal Ballet,brings it a new life. There are two Giselles in this 2 act ballet:In Act 1,Giselle is an innocent,""naf"" peasant girl ,full of joy ,who tragically finds a treacherous love and dies. In Act 2 she belongs to the world of the dead,integrating the legion of the Wilis( cruel,translucent virgins ),confined to the magic of the night,under Myrtha's command - their queen.
The gracefulness of this portrayed 17 year-old and moving Giselle is completely brought out by this lovely ,highly gifted ballerina. But it is in the complexity of Act 2 coreography that Cojocaru makes all the difference:Slow movements,an extremely beautiful ""developpe"" (Zakharova's is slightly more impressive ,at la Scala,but totally absorved in her refined technique,expressing in the face either a smile of joy or a rictus of grief throughout the whole performance,thus forgetting to bring out Giselle's inner feelings), her arms being a vehicle of expression as important as the leggs (Russian School).
She becomes aethereal ,the perfect illusion of bearing no weight as a spirit would,on ""pointes"" or when lifted by Kohborg. Her splendid techique,used with intelligence makes this Giselle deserving to be remembered along with the best ones. Kohborg is a wonderful Albrecht ( his variation beautifully executed) Marianela Nuez a haughty ,convincing Myrtha and Marin Harvey a very good Hilarion. The ""corps"" bears the recognised quality of The Royal Ballet,live from Covent Garden,Boris Cruzin conducting with ""panache"".A most brilliant event.",1234569600,7,2558,5.681462140992167
3544719,5,B001E08TDA,"Giselle is one of my favorite ""Romantic"" ballets. You probably already know that this version stars the perpetually young and very accomplished ballerina Alina Cojocaru as the beautiful Maiden/Wili ""Giselle"". Even the title of this ballet is beautiful, when pronounced the French way (zhee-zel).

Sir Peter Wright is in charge of the production of this version by the Royal Ballet. That, in itself, guarantees you of an authentic version of the ballet, since Peter Wright researches his productions to their very origins, to give you the product the authors meant for you to have. The original was apparently shot in Hi-Definition, but the DVD is NOT Hi-Def, although the DVD has exceptionally good quality resolution.

Giselle is a beautiful, but naive maiden whose mother has a wayside inn where passers-by may stop and refresh themselves. Hilarion, the local gamekeeper, is in love with Giselle, and considers her his future bride. However, his love is not returned by Giselle. Count Albrecht has seen Giselle and wants to romance her, but he is already engaged to Bathilde, a member of Royalty. Albrecht deceives Giselle by dressing himself as a peasant, and calling himself ""Loy"", buys a house close to hers. As the romance blossoms, Giselle is very happy and shows her happiness in her dancing. Because Giselle has a weak heart, she overexerts herself and becomes feint. On seeing this, her mother forbids her from dancing. Her mother, Berthe, has had a dream, in which she has seen her daughter die to become a ""Wili"", the ghost of a virgin who has died of a broken heart before her wedding, because of the treachery of an unfaithful lover.

Trouble begins when a Regal Party, including Bathilde, enters the village for refreshments. Hilarion, having discovered Albrecht's deceit, exposes him to everyone, and Giselle literally goes mad in her grief, and the most heart-wrenching ""mad"" scene in all of ballet or opera takes place on stage. Giselle, in her deranged state of mind picks up Albrecht's sword and stabs herself. She dies, and I cry.

Giselle is buried in a forest glade, with a simple wooden cross to mark her grave. Hilarion has come to her grave-site to mourn for her, but is scared out of his wits by ghostly apparitions, and runs off into the forest. The apparitions are Wilis who appear at midnight to haunt the forest. Their leader or Queen is Myrthe. She summons all the Wilis to the glade, and some of the most beautiful ""white"" dancing in all ballet takes place there, after which Giselle is summoned from her grave to join the Wilis. In the meantime, Albrecht enters looking for Giselle's grave, and while he is praying, she appears to him as a ghost.

The Wilis will kill any man they ""catch"" in the forest, by forcing him to dance himself to death. But, what do you do with a dead body on the stage?
So, they usually force him into a lake to drown. Hilarion is the first victim of the Wilis. Then they catch Albrecht and command him to dance himself to death, but Giselle, in defiance of her Queen, intervenes, and has Albrecht seek sanctuary at the cross on her grave. The Wili Queen daren't go near it because it is sacred. The Queen then commands Giselle to dance with Albrecht, and because of her undying love, she is able to support him until dawn, when the Wilis lose their power. In one last act of defiance, Giselle comes between Myrthe and Albrecht.

One wonders why Hilarion has to die when the real Cad, Albrecht lives. Seems unfair, doesn't it? Buy this ballet and see why it has such an appeal to the masses. Ballet masses, that is.  Good viewing, Richard.",1230336000,6,3600,4.741214057507987
3544720,5,B001E08TDA,Alina Cojocaru gives an outstanding performance. She dances with such grace and beauty that it is hard to imagine anyone else in this role. She alone would makes this a DVD worth owning. But of course there is much more to praise in this performance. I very much liked the sets but they seem to overly stretch the capacity of the stage. Marianela Nunez is very fine as Myrtha. My one complaint is the camera work at the end of Act 1 - R.Nicholson covers it well. I am very pleased with this Giselle and highly recommend it.,1228003200,4,523,4.346938775510204
3544721,5,B001E08TDA,"I think no one need fear buying this performance; overall, it is very fine and I think it deserves a top rating, even though I hesitated over a possible four.  Technically and overall, a five; though it evokes only an emotional response of four from me.  My chief disappointment is the Albrecht.  His dancing is accomplished and he acts well, especially in close-up, though I find him slightly mannered at times.  My main complaint, however, is that he doesn't seem really to connect to Giselle.  He acts outwardly as though he does but, especially in the second act, I really don't believe him.  My eyes tell me they care deeply for each other, but my heart remains stubbornly unconvinced.  I noticed during the curtain calls that he didn't seem genuinely pleased by the hearty applause given him.  A few smiles, yes; but mostly rather blank.  Perhaps he's simply a rather cool personality?  But Giselle needs the heights of passion and the depths of redemptive love, not committed reserve.  Cojocaru on the other hand is an utter delight.  I can't imagine anyone looking the part more.  And she can certainly act.  And she can most certainly dance!  She has a luminous sweetness that transforms the stage.  With more chemistry from her Albrecht, this might have been as close to definitive as one could hope for, because everyone else is first rate.  The Myrthe is especially noteworthy:  technically wonderful and dramatically full of menace without seeming to try.  It comes from within.  And poor Hilarion who, I always feel, gets the rawest of deals is here very sympathetic.  Possibly even handsomer than Albrecht [I really did feel Giselle made a poor choice in this case!] - a kind of Eric Bana of dance.  It's only a pity the role didn't  supply him more chances to dance, because when he did he had all the presence that Albrecht lacked.  Finally, if I could pull Nicholas Le Riche from the Paris Opera DVD of Giselle and put him in this production, I think I would be happier.  [And, as long as I'm dreaming, let's have Tsiskaridze.]  But I'm still glad that I have this production, despite my lack of abandon where Albrecht is concerned.  And you really do need to see Cojocaru.  The image of her Giselle lingers long in the mind.",1226620800,28,2243,4.711340206185567
3544722,5,B001E08TDA,"I also love Giselle and have waited for a Royal Ballet production.  This is worth waiting for.
I am not a ballet expert as are some who review but I love this DVD.  The whole cast is outstanding and one of the things I really like is that the mime is really good.  Giselle's mother tells us her worries about her daughter and what may happen to her.  I also like the fact that after the introduction and dance of Myrtha in Act 2 she is not just left to stand there, look cold and direct her Wilis (as in almost every other production).  Nunez is given a chance to dance her role when possible and she does it well.
I love Cojocaru in the role and think she is better in this than in Sleeping Beauty.
My favorite production of this is the ABT one with Makarova,Baryshnikov and Van Hammel but it's only on VHS and I dispair of it ever coming out on DVD (does anyone know why?).
Absolutely no regrets about buying this DVD",1226016000,7,919,4.169491525423729
3544723,5,B001E08TDA,"Revised review Dec 02/08. (see P.P.S.)

Let me start off by saying that Giselle is my favorite ballet; I love the story, the music and the dance.

This performance was recorded in 2006 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Gardens, London and stars Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobberg in the principal roles.

This is probably the best danced and finest interpretation of this magnificent ballet I've ever seen. I initially saw this at a movie theater with about 200+ people; you could have heard a pin drop during many of the pas de deux between Cojocaru and Kobberg, they were that stirring to watch.

There was so much to like about this performance...let me elaborate,

the Pros:

1.)The costumes for the peasants, the Royal hunting party and Wilis were sumptuous; the sets for both acts were nicely conceived to display the rustic theme for the village in Act I and then the marsh scene in Act II.

2.)The principal dancers, Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg gave the performance of a lifetime. Cojocaru has such skill and grace...an easy effortlessness that holds her audience spellbound. Kobberg attains such height with his leaps and jumps that it appears as if he can defy gravity.

3.) The emotion displayed, through facial expression and body language, by both leads was perfect for the situation; their dancing techniques  and skills when together, were simply breath taking. Some of the famous lifts in the Act II were, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen in any performance of Giselle.

4.) The conductor, Boris Gruzin, interpretation of Adophe Adam's music was beautifully rendered, complimenting the tone and mood of this ballet that covered both ends of the emotional spectrum.

The Cons:

About the only concern (albeit minor) for this interpretation of Giselle was with regards to the Corps de ballet. Although the dancing through out the entire ballet was excellent, some of the timing of movement and dance steps was slightly off between some couples, particularly in Act I.

Conclusion:
Simply the loveliest Giselle I've ever seen; a Giselle that literally moved me to tears. The emotions shown and skills displayed by Cojocaru during this performance were as close to perfection as anyone could ask.
5 Stars.

Ray Nicholson

P.S.
Interestingly, the program accompanying the theater performance I saw stated, 'Legend has it that she (Cojocaru) was promoted to principal at the end of the first performance'. You'll understand why when you've seen this DVD.

P.P.S.
I must admit to a grievous error on my part with my initial review, in which I criticized some of the camera shots and angles. This initial review was based on my viewing of this performance in a movie theater. The home DVD video was much better visually than the performance seen in the movie theater; better because of a much sharper picture as well as less 'close-up' camera shots. I suspect the enlargement that took place to fill an entire movie screen caused some distortion in perception of size and movement, giving the movie house performance a less than perfect visual presentation.
My apologies go out to the producers and editors of this fine DVD for my initial review based on my movie theater experience.

3544724,3,B001E08TDA,"Natalia Osipova is no match to Alina Cojocaru, neither Carlos Acosta toJohan  Kobborg. Even the conducting of Boris Gruzin this time around is not up to snuff: in the 2006 rendition Gruzin like any good ballet conductor watched and followed the dancers, not in this last production. There is parallelism between the orchestra cum conductor and actions on the stage but no fully integrated coordination which is the hallmark of the 2006 recording. Cojocaru and Kobborg not only play Giselle and Albrecht, they are Giselle and Albrecht, while Osipova and Acosta only play Giselle and Albrecht, and that in not a very convincing way because neither  can act. Watch closely the hardly changing expressions on their faces throughout. Although Hikaru Kobayashi as Myrtha is pretty good, Marianela Nunyez in the 2006 rendition is much superior, again both in her superb dancing and very convincing acting.",1438300800,3,898,5.186206896551724
3544725,5,B001E08TDA,"I saw this ballerina in a movie theater playing lead in Swan Lake and was very impressed.

3544727,5,B001E08TDA,"I'll be the first to admit I haven't seen every version of Giselle available, but of the ones I've seen, this is by far the best. Osipova, in the first act, is the happiest, most light-hearted and carefree Giselle I've ever seen (all the other dancers I've seen in this role have played it with a sense of impending doom); and in the second act, she's very touching as the young woman still heart-broken over the betrayal and duplicity of the man she loved, but still compassionate enough to forgive him. She's absolutely outstanding throughout the whole performance. Acosta is completely believable in the second act as the guilt-stricken perpetrator, especially as morning approaches and he's close to death; in the first act, it's also obvious that he's horrified at the prospect of being found out. However, as the courting lover, he could have taken some lessons from Rudolf Nureyev. Nureyev played the part so convincingly, you could almost believe his Albrecht really loved Giselle (if you didn't know he was already engaged to someone else). Other than that, Acosta was terrific in this role.

I also have to add that Hikaru Kobayashi was phenomenal as Myrtha, the stern, unyielding leader who demands absolute and unquestioning loyalty and obedience from the Wilis, and is completely incapable of understanding Giselle's love and compassion for the man who so brutally betrayed her. Thomas Whitehead is also excellent as Hilarion, the man who really did love Giselle and tried to prevent the tragedy that ensued.

I also liked some of the ""artistic extras,"" like the smoke rolling across the floor when the Wilis entered.",1425340800,2,1630,5.011070110701107

is not quite up to the deeply moving ABT Giselle featuring her and David Hallberg that was shown in cinemas a couple of years ago. In contrast to that one, there was little chemistry between Osipova and her partner, although Acosta's partnering is excellent.  A great dancer near the end of his career, Acosta seems to be acting rather than being Albrecht.  This one's staging is not quite as imaginative as ABT's -- in Act 2, for example, Giselle appears and disappears very conventionally from behind a rock at stage right, while ABT has her exit in the direction the other Wilis went, at stage left, toward the lake in the background.  In an interview Osipova says she has learned a lot about her role from the direction of Peter Wright, but in reality she could have taught him more than a few things.

It's the same leader of the hunt and several of the company are the same. (This production was first performed at the Royal Opera in 28 November 1985) Here I'm taking about the performance of Giselle recorded in 2006 from the Royal Ballet with Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg as the Albrect. Now in 2014 we have Royal ensemble again with Natalia Osipova as Giselle and Carlos Acosta as the Albrect. So it's Deja Vu ""all over again"" as that baseball immortal used to say.
They are both superb recordings, beautifully executed and completely satisfying as far as art and artistry are concerned. It would be impossible to say which is the better performance. So I will keep both and add them to my collection of Giselle recordings.
Giselle was first produced in 1841 and was very successful at the Paris Opera Comique. The composer Adolf Adam wrote some 70 opera and many ballets, operettas and a huge amount of piano pieces in his short life span (1803-1856) but nothing else has achieved lasting popularity except his ballet Giselle. It and Swan Lake define the true spirit of classic 19th century romantic ballet. It and Swan Lake are the reference points on which a ballerina are judged. Each performer makes it her own in her own way. In my personal opinion both Giselles are equal and I couldn't say which is the better. In this moment I think Cojocaru is better and in the next it's Osipova. I think of Osipova and the highly spirited athletic type; she was superb in ""Flames of Paris"". I think of Cojocaru as the most divine Odette, the epitome of elegance and grace.
I have stronger opinions on the other characters in the ballet. I think Johan Kobborg looks and acts more like a romantic prince. Carlos Acosta danced superbly in this Giselle but he is the absolute athletic hero in Spartacus. What a thrill to watch him!  The Hilarion was more appropriate and believable as done by Martin Harvey in the Cojocaru recording. Thomas Whitehead is a little too old to be chasing young girls and his acting was at a loss.
As Myrtha, Queen of the Willis  both ladies gave me the willis, but I think Marianela Nunez had an icy stare that was a bit colder than Hikare Kobayashi though she was certainly a chilly willi. And I think that the orchestra led by Boris Cruzin was a bit more lyrical, yet poignant in this Osipova recording. Both beautifully done.
So there you have it. This great immortal ballet in two versions of equal stature. So why not get both and then start collecting Giselles as I do",1412380800,11,2670,4.654661016949152
3544736,5,B001E08TDA,"This is the second Royal Ballet Giselle to appear on the Opus Arte label and, like the much admired predecessor, this new disc offers both excellent camera work and truthful depth of colour. In terms of sound it offers a considerable advance on the earlier recording which was not of Opus Arte's finest. The earlier disc nevertheless offers an outstanding performance by all concerned which is now matched by this new account which received glowing first performance press reviews without exception.

There are other similarities: Both offer Peter Wright's vision as producer, both have the same choreography, original lighting, designs, scenario, orchestra and conductor. The main focus where they differ is in the choice of cast, especially as regards the main characters of Giselle and Albrecht.

Natalia Osipova makes an inspired choice as Giselle combining a remarkable technical assurance with inspired acting skills which enable her to portray Giselle as the nave country girl fallen victim to Albrecht's wiles. Her collapse is portrayed as the result of shock resulting from being unable to comprehend how it is possible for someone who loves her to so lie to her. There is no suggestion of madness or unhinged behaviour which makes her far easier to empathise with.

Acosta portrays Albrecht as having a trivial fling initially but transforming into a caring relationship eventually, but far too late of course. This is a more conventional interpretation and he, like Osipova, has all the technical and artistic skill to deliver fully and be fully supportive of Giselle as a dance partner. It is clear that a close stage bond has been forged between the pair.

Thomas Whitehead makes for a believable Hilarion and the icy Queen of the Willis is remorselessly portrayed by Hikaru Kobayashi to perfection. The other supporting roles of Giselle's mother and of the nobility are equally well done.

The Corps de Ballet are of high quality and the important Willis in Act 2 are excellently danced both individually and as a group. On this occasion they would stand comparison with the famed Russian alternatives.

Musically there are small but important differences though and these may well be critical. Although the conductor, Boris Gruzin, is the same as the previous Royal Ballet offering, on this occasion the choices of tempi and pace throughout are marginally sharper, more flexible, more focussed and more fluent. Although individually small, accumulatively these add considerably to the forward momentum of the drama and add point to the changing action on the stage and overall conceptual tightness. The recording is also fuller and more `punchy' with greater definition generally.

There are two short bonus interview features during which Osipova, Acosta and Peter Wright discuss interpretation and preparation in the one and the other has a similar focus upon the corps de ballet and the Willis of act 2. These are short but worthwhile bonuses to which is added the usual gallery of performers.

It is not reasonable to suggest any one disc as `the best' or as being `definitive' but this one is surely one of the very best currently available. The closest exact competition must come from the other Opus Arte recording from 2006 with Alina Cojocaru as Giselle, ably partnered by Johan Kobborg. Marianela Nunez is a less icy Queen of the Willis. The excellence of this new disc should in no way be inherently detrimental to the performances offered by that earlier account, compromised though its sound is and certainly when compared with this fine new recording. Personal preferences as regards casting will be the most likely deciding factors here.

I would suggest that collectors interested in alternative recordings of excellent performances should consider this disc very seriously. Those who are looking for a single example of an excellent Giselle should find that this disc offers an unusual degree of satisfaction on every level.

3544743,5,B001E08TDA,"Alina Cojocaru IS Giselle. No other active ballerina, including my first love, Tamara Rojo, could play it better. The tenderness and vulnerbility she brings to the role is incredible.",1361232000,3,183,5.344827586206897
3544744,3,B001E08TDA,"I ordered this performance of ""Giselle"" with great anticipation - I was aware of Alina Cojocaru's gifts and all indications pointed to a role tailor made for her. However, I was disappointed on many fronts. First, although Cojocaru IS a very fine dancer, and genuinely sympathetic by nature (as opposed to, say, a card-carrying diva like Makarova), she somehow failed to project a Giselle that survived the closing curtain. Whatever element, either technical or dramatic, that makes a performance of this role unforgettable, was absent. Cojocaru was good but not, as I somehow expected, great. Something fell flat, and I'm still not sure what it was. Today's dancers are not as good at mime as previous generations, and I think perhaps the mime was not vivid enough - not followed through strongly, and this was true of everyone, not just Cojocaru. Some cuts to this ballet are appreciated: e.g., Giselle's mother's warning in mime of what would happen to her if she died of her dancing went on far too long, as did the ancillary dancing. Cojocaru's mad scene was good; she seemed genuinely heartbroken, but not unhinged - the shift from normalcy to madness was not marked. This is the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, and the troupe is always fine, but in this case, the peasant pas de quatre that took the place of the sometimes excerpted peasant pas de deux seemed to take forever and wasn't particularly interesting (another cut I would have appreciated). The women acquitted themselves better than the men from the Royal's soloist rank here - the Royal's second-rank male soloists were of uncharacteristically dull quality.

There were many things I did not care for in the production, too. Poor Hilarion was done up to look as he were barely out of the Stone Age - weighting the deck unfairly toward the elegant stranger who suddenly appears in the village - unsurprising that the fine-natured Giselle is not enthusiastic about him, but then, were they not affianced before Albrecht appears? Peter Wright's production makes the mistake of going too rustic, more 15th century than mid-19th century. One of this ballet's problems can be a tendency to bucolic prettiness. Too far in either direction is a disservice to a production of ""Giselle"", and this one errs too far in the drab, rustic direction. Aiming for ""authenticity is pointless with ""Giselle"", as there is no authenticity here: it's a 19th century redemption morality tale and no one really dies of a broken heart after a one-day romance with a virtual stranger.

Re Act II: Here, Cojocaru's technical weaknesses were more evident, despite her flexibility and legendary extensions. If you compare her work to the fleet, airy footwork, airborne quality, and gorgeous port de bras of someone like Carla Fracci in her prime, Cojocaru again falls into the good but not great category. The exquisite, aching tenderness that should inform every movement of Giselle, escaped her. She was light and sweet but not so much more so than other Giselles I have seen.

The Act II sets, however, were better - it's hard to screw up a forest bathed in moonlight.  The Myrtha, Marianela Nunez, was excellent - it's a thankless role but she danced it full out, with technical sureness and conviction.

Coming to the Albrecht, I was also disappointed in Kobbold, who I understand is Cojocaru's partner in real life.  A clean, decent danseur, an attentive partner, but a curiously flat characterization with not one moment that would, either technically or dramatically, survive the falling of the final curtain. If you have seen Erik Bruhn, with whom Kobbold shares Danish nationality but not much else, Peter Schaufuss (another Dane), Ivan Nagy, Angel Coralli, Anthony Dowell, Wayne Eagling . . . this gentleman unfortunately is not on the same level as these Albrechts.  Able to perform the steps and partner decently, and no more.

I disliked the costumes for Act II, as well. Many productions dispense with the wings on the Wilis, which I heartily support; with a ballet that can teeter close to silliness, the wings are an unnecessary risk. And the Wilis are not sprites who can fly, like Sylphides: they are the ghosts of dead women. The wings aren't even appropriate. I tolerate them in is La Sylphide, where they are a necessity because of the manner in which the Sylphide dies at the end. Cojocaru shares with Carla Fracci a less than beautifully proportioned and muscled body, with bony shoulders and wide feet - the narrow flattish costume for the Royal's Act II Giselle did her body no favors. Fracci very cleverly had her own special Act II costume made, and its very full, weightless skirt, flutters of material at the shoulders, and tiny rosettes at the neckline, conceal Fracci's flaws and accentuate her strengths. Cojocaru should consider doing the same.

The corps did very well in their big scene at the beginning of Act II as the music built up to their traveling arabesques and Myrtha's final set of turns and grand jetes.

All in all, the only word that comes to mind about this performance is work-a-day. On the recommendation of so many of you who also reviewed this DVD, I ordered the well spoken of performance by the Dutch National Ballet and will review it there.

I have seen many Giselles in my time, both on film and live: Ulanova on film, Makarova on film and live, Fracci live and on film, Fonteyn on film (very poor quality film, though), Lynn Seymour live and on film, Viviana Durante live with ABT in the late 1990s, Gelsey Kirkland live, and a quite decent performance by the young Marianna Tcherkassky.  Of these, only two Giselles emerged as haunting: Ulanova and Fracci. Viviana Durante, tiny and fragile with tremendous technique, seemingly a natural for the role, and who blew my socks off as Aurora, also proved a bland disappointment as Giselle.

Thus, with all its flaws in direction and camera work and cuts, so far the American Ballet Theater 1968 DVD studio performance of David Blair's lovely production of ""Giselle"" is still my personal favorite. Its record of Fracci at the height of her powers, with her beautiful, expressive face born for the stage, her swift footwork and creamy, weightless port de bras in Act II, combined with the elegant, cool aspect of Erik Bruhn as Albrecht, the darkly handsome Bruce Marks as the devoted Hilarion (actually looking like someone Giselle might have settled on if Albrecht hadn't appeared), and the cold, imperious dancing of Toni Lander as Myrtha, is very hard to beat.  I have yet to see a second act as ravishing as Fracci's, or a mad scene as heartbreaking as Ulanova's, although she was close to retirement at the time the film was made - yet, the look of wandering vagueness on her face as she plucked the petals from the imaginary daisy is something I have never forgotten.

The problem for all Giselles is that in order to make the role haunting, you need to be a great stage actress with tremendous powers of projection, as well as a great dancer, and there is no guarantee that any dancer, no matter how accomplished technically, will possess both qualities. Fonteyn and Fracci are exceptions: had they not been great dancers, they could have had careers in the theater. You don't need to be a great actress to pull off a spectacular Aurora or Odette or Sugar Plum Fairy - if you have the technique to pull off the steps, a decent if not superb dramatic effort will satisfy an audience. But a truly great Giselle requires a great stage actress, or all the audience takes away is a sort of antique charm that pleases the eye but not the heart.

I truly hoped to see an unforgettable Giselle here, but did not - sorry to disagree with so many of you!  The DVD is not by any means a waste of money but this generation's Great Giselle it is not.",1357862400,8,7788,4.795674869500373
3544745,4,B001E08TDA,"This is a very fine performance of Giselle. I prefer it marginally to the more recent Bolshoi version and for me this remains my favourite performance.

Cojocaru's dancing in a role that seems to have been conceived for her, portrays the heroine as the lovable but fatally nave country girl that she is and as her mother (excellent portrayal by Sandra Conley) so clearly understands. This fragility carries over convincingly to the second act where Nunez, as leader of the Willis in this act is not as cold-bloodied as some. As a result the element of redemption through love is relatively unimpeded here.

The two competing men here are well up to the task required of them although I always personally feel that the morally justified Hilarion is appallingly sacrificed so that the real villain, Albrecht, can escape proper justice. Nevertheless Hilarion as portrayed by Martin Harvey and Albrecht as portrayed by Johan Kobborg do everything that can be done to bring their roles to life on the stage.

The corps de ballet are on fine form with involving portrayals of the various crowd scenes in the first act and as the Willis in the second act. The Willis are as ethereally effective in this performance as usual although it must be admitted that those in an earlier Kirov performance were able to move as if on wheels. Astonishing!

The imaging is crisp and without movement blur. The colour range is well balanced. The sound is presented in stereo and surround 5.0 and this leads me to the reservations in the following paragraph. These may simply be the result of the recording not having a designated 5.1 sub-woofer channel to specifically take care of the bass frequencies.

The problem for me concerns the sound quality heard in surround mode on particularly wide-ranging equipment. This shows the orchestra to be working in the dry acoustic that you would expect in a packed theatre which can be adjusted to in all respects except one. That is the booming and undefined sound of the bass drum. This becomes oppressive and totally out of balance with the rest of the soundstage and is at odds with the delicate nature of the ballet. This is not a problem of the musical scoring but rather that of poor recording. This may not be an issue with less wide ranging reproduction where the bass frequencies are carried only by the main left and right speakers which often have less extended bass. Maybe a case of less giving more in terms of satisfaction!

In summary therefore I feel that five stars is richly deserved for the ballet but only three for the sound quality as revealed on my admittedly somewhat extreme equipment. However I am also aware that this may not be audibly significant with most replay equipment so perhaps only a minor adjustment of rating probably needs to be made. An overall adjustment to 4 stars would therefore seem to be fair to accommodate ballet enthusiasts who are also keen on h-fi.",1341532800,2,2922,4.776237623762376

3544751,1,B001E08TDA,"Giselle is the first ballet I ever saw in the theater and I have subsequently seen it many more times on stage. As well, I have more performances on video/DVD/Blu-ray of Giselle than of any other ballet. Along with the Bournonville Sylphide, Giselle is the greatest and most magical of all romantic ballets and in a good performance it is an overwhelming artistic and emotional experience.

This production is by far the worst I have ever seen, and, at best, the performances are adequate. I thought the decor for act one was the nadir, and then the curtain rose on an even more appalling Act II. These hideous sets and drab, dull and dreary costumes need to be immortalized in the Blu-ray process?  This is the ugliest Giselle production I've ever seen.

Additionally, this is one of the most disrespectful productions of Giselle I know with the cuts beginning right in the overture and continuing throughout the performance. These folk feel free not only to excise parts of Adam's score, but 'adapt' and add to it as well.

What they do here to the Peasant Pas is enough to entirely disqualify this lousy production from any serious consideration.  Here we get a limp and disorganized pas de six instead, in which one of the anonymous girls gets an extended solo that is, to put it mildly, not a usual feature of Giselle productions. Perhaps the people who put this thing together thought that six underwhelming dancers would equal out to the two good ones generally to be found in this absolutely wonderful segment of the ballet?

Cojacaru is, of course, a good dancer and a better actor, but she is undisciplined, lacking in a smooth, chiseled line, in dignity, and in authority. She moves fast, but with little poise and with jerky arm movements much of the time, particularly in the fast turns. She often isn't graceful. The other dancers are featureless - this is all her, and 'Mr. Cojacaru's' show, apparently.

This is a highly naturalistic production, which has its good points as it plays to the strengths of the two leads (it gets tiresome fast - for instance the excessive detail work of Giselle's mother and, particularly, the extremely irritating PC spin they attach to the Duchess with her comic book snobbery). What is bad about naturalism carried to this extreme in a work like Giselle is that it robs the work of almost all its mythic qualities, which in turn explains the total lack of impact which characterizes this performance. I wasn't moved once, I didn't cry once and I was bored a lot.

The dancers might have registered better if the disrespect for the work did not extend to extra choreography provided by somebody or other. People who feel free to snip and paste at will, transform an exquisite scene designed to showcase the youth and vitality of two vibrant kids into a dreary bore for six faceless non entities, and plop it all down in front of such ghastly decor feel no qualms about 'improving' Coralli, Perot and Petipa. What riduculous hubris.  All the choreographic changes are for the worse.

I sometimes fast forward through the entrance of the aristocrats (in all the other, better Giselle performances out there), but found myself fast forwarding through most of this performance.

There are many fine performances of Giselle but this sure isn't one of them.",1287964800,14,3300,4.792253521126761
3544752,4,B001E08TDA,"Let me get to the punch line first.  This is almost a ""must buy"" despite my 4-star rating which I'll explain below.

In the last several years, it's extremely difficult to keep up with the young ballerinas coming up the ranks.  The Russian schools seem to have put out an unending stream of really talented and accomplished young female dancers whose names would require memory training to retain.  Polina Semionova, Alina Somova, Maria Alexandrova, Alina Cojocaru, and one Osipova.  Any more?

They are already principal dancers in the major houses - Bolshoi, Royal Ballet, Kirov, Berlin - and they all have ""stories"" attached to them if you read about them on Google.  Semionova was specifically recruited by Berlin to partner Malakhov; Plisetskaya was so impressed by Somova that she took off her diamond ear rings and gave them to the awed young woman; Cojocaru turned down an offer of principal dancer by the Kiev Ballet and joined the Corps de Ballet at the Royal Ballet so she could improve more freely.  I believe it.  This is exciting stuff.

This Giselle was danced by Alina Cojocaru, a Romanian trained by the Kiev.  She's fabulous.  Every movement, turn, jump, and pose was precise and beautiful to look at.  She also paid great attention to the story and acted very well.  The ending of Act I might even be a bit over dramatic, but she was committed so I would not fault her.  In Act II, the Corps was on stage 80% or more of the time and the ladies were magnificent.  You wonder whether they tried extra hard to support their former colleague from their rank.  It's one thing to do grand jete in ones, twos or even fours.  But these women gave me the impression that they were FLYING in precision formation in the same split second as a squadron.  I watched the second act three times in a row.

So why only 4 stars?  Ah, great ballet has long reaches and memories.  The one big shadow for me is the 1977 American Ballet Theatre Giselle with Markarova, Baryshnikov, and Martine van Hamel.  Others may have theirs because there had been so many great Giselles over the years.  Galina Ulanova, Alexandra Ferri, Carla Fracci just to recall a few. Don't forget several other Russian ladies whose names I can't spell anymore.  Many of their performances had been preserved on film. Man, it's a tough crowd!

One also has to think about the Albrechts and Myrthas (we can forget the Hilarions for simplication of comparison.)  In this Giselle, Marianela Nunez was wonderful, practically in the prima ballerina class in which I think she actually belongs.  But Martine van Hamel was perfection, so good you could cry while watching her.  How about Albrecht?  Kobborg was good.  However, he's no Erik Bruhn even though he's Danish.  Baryshnikov was already a trademark in the late 70's for reasons other than looks and hype.  He's one great dancer! It's almost not fair to compare.

Finally, there's the conducting.  The Russian maestro Boris Gruzin must be a very considerate man.  He gave the dancers all the slack they needed.  As a result, his beat tended to follow especially the soloists, not lead them or urge them on.  This had consequences.  The music lost propulsivesness in several key scenes, especially when approaching crescendos and climaxes.  The virtue on the other hand was that the dancers looked good on stage because they ""finished"" at the same time with the music.  But I prefer the tension of the music over a perfect pose.

John Lanchbery conducting the Markarova version was never pushy.  He just kept a tighter rein.  In fact, his tempo in places were slower than Gruzin's.  Markarova must have loved him because he let her move and let the music ""surround"" her movements, neither leading nor following.  It took me many hours listening to Lanchbery's Swan Lake to realize what a great ballet conductor he was.  He did not conduct as a symphony conductor, but as a ballet master.

So why is this Giselle a Best Buy?  It's a modern rcording.  HD quality and surround sound.  Young Cojacaru was simply a delight!  Technique, acting, and total dedication to the role.  The Corps to me was women's beauty at its finest.  Then look at the price.  Unbeatable.",1280448000,25,4184,4.752089136490251

The music of Adoph Adam is simple, with easy melodies, naive, sometimes even silly. But fell in public taste.

The composer had 3 weeks to write the book and used portions of another of his own ballet, Le Pirate.

The Covent Garden production is impeccable, perfect scenery and costumes were in keeping with the libretto.

The direction of images is excellent, shows all the scenes with clarity.

Light of a unique beauty and traditional choreography. The orchestra conducted by Boriz Cruzin has excellent sound, especially in the woods.

Alina Cojocaru is in a state of grace. Criticized his performance in Sleeping Beauty by the lack of emotion, but that the dancer Giselle shows all his artistic potential. Your body and facial expressions are perfectly adapted to Giselle. Dance with delicacy printing a naivety poor provincial girl. Her mad scene that closes the first act is to shatter. By becoming Willis jumps beautifully giving the illusion of being a troubled spirit.

Johan Kobborg shows Albrecht is a right, its best passages are when you the duets with Giselle. There is great chemistry between them, the end of the second act is remarkable.

Hilarion is the most wronged character in the history of ballet, a man of pure heart and love go all out to show that such Giselle Albrecht is just a sleazy second-rate and consegue. Mas the girl is in love and when that happens it seems she can not think. Proof of Giselle that the prince is preppy boyfriend of another, or a great liar. What does he gain from it, death. Will visit the girl in his grave and take a Pataquiva of Willis who send him to the cemetery. What does heroin even after her death to the man who tried to open their eyes? Nothing, let him go to hell without remorca. But Giselle in her passion breathtaking saves the scoundrel, who lied to her saying he was poor and without compromise and caused his death. He quite ready to live and she mortinha da silva. What love can stand so dirty!

Women of my Brazil you do this?

Hilarion is represented by Martin Harvey and boy does the job perfectly. Another highlight is always exciting for the participation of Marianela Nunez, ballerina roles accepts ""small"" and turns it into huge, Myrtha its technical quality is exceptional and emotional.

The corps de ballet of the Mountbatten participation has sometimes modest, sometimes interesting.

A msica de Adoph Adam  simples, com melodias fceis, ingnuas , as vezes at bobinhas. Mas caiu no gosto do pblico.

O compositor teve 3 semanas para compor a obra e utilizou trechos de outro bal de sua autoria, Le Pirate.

A produo do Covent Garden  impecvel, cenrio e figurino perfeitos , condizentes com o libreto.

A direo de imagens est excelente, mostra todas as cenas com clareza.

Luz de uma beleza mpar e coreografia tradicional. A orquestra regida por Boriz Cruzin tem excelente sonoridade, principalmente nas madeiras.

Alina Cojocaru est em estado de graa. Critiquei sua apresentao em Sleeping Beauty pela falta de emoo, mas nessa Giselle a bailarina mostra todo seu potencial artstico. Seu corpo e suas expresses faciais se adaptam perfeitamente a Giselle .Dana com delicadeza imprimindo uma ingnuidade a pobre moa interiorana . Sua cena da loucura que fecha o primeiro ato  de arrasar. Quando se transforma em Willis salta com beleza dando a iluso de ser um esprito atormentado.

Johan Kobborg mostra-se um Albrecht correto, suas melhores passagens esto quando faz os duetos com Giselle. Existe grande qumica entre ambos, o final do segundo ato  memorvel.

Hilarion  o personagem mais injustiado da histria do bal, homem de corao puro e apaixonado faz de tudo para mostrar a Giselle que esse tal de Albrecht no passa de um pilantra de segunda categoria e o consegue. Mas a moa est apaixonada e quando isso acontece parece que ela no consegue pensar. Prova a Giselle que o prncipe mauricinho  noivo de outra, ou seja, um grande mentiroso. O que ele ganha com isso, a morte. Vai visitar a moa em seu tmulo e leva uma pataquada das Willis que o mandam ao cemitrio. O que a herona faz mesmo depois de morta para o homem que tentou abrir seus olhos? Nada, deixa ele ir para o inferno sem remoros. Mas Giselle em sua paixo arrebatadora salva o pilantra, aquele que mentiu para ela dizendo que era pobre e sem compromisso e provocou sua morte. Ele vivo para aprontar bastante e ela mortinha da silva. Que amor aguenta tanta sacanagem!

Mulheres do meu Brasil vocs fariam isso?

Hilarion  representado por Martin Harvey e o rapaz d conta do recado com perfeio. Outro destaque fica para a sempre emocionante participao de Marianela Nunez, bailarina que aceita papis ""pequenos"" e o transforma em enormes, sua Myrtha  de qualidade tcnica e emotiva excepcional.

O corpo de baile do Covent Gardem tem participao as vezes modesta, as vezes interessante.

I just want to worn you that the music if far from ideal. I have several CDs of this ballet with far better sound. If you listen to it through your TV then may be you don't mind or probably the music will sound good. On the other hand if you listen through high quality stereo then you will hear the boominess.
P.S. I didn't have a home theater system and I cannot say how it would sound there.",1252886400,2,564,4.136363636363637
3544760,5,B001E08TDA,"Giselle is one of the most popular ballets of all time, gets a new DVD version recorded in 2006 with the London theater production of Covent Garden.

The music of Adoph Adam is simple, with easy melodies, naive, sometimes even silly. But fell in public taste.

The composer had 3 weeks to write the book and used portions of another of his own ballet, Le Pirate.

The Covent Garden production is impeccable, perfect scenery and costumes were in keeping with the libretto.

The direction of images is excellent, shows all the scenes with clarity.

Light of a unique beauty and traditional choreography. The orchestra conducted by Boriz Cruzin has excellent sound, especially in the woods.

Alina Cojocaru is in a state of grace. Criticized his performance in Sleeping Beauty by the lack of emotion, but that the dancer Giselle shows all his artistic potential. Your body and facial expressions are perfectly adapted to Giselle. Dance with delicacy printing a naivety poor provincial girl. Her mad scene that closes the first act is to shatter. By becoming Willis jumps beautifully giving the illusion of being a troubled spirit.

Johan Kobborg shows Albrecht is a right, its best passages are when you the duets with Giselle. There is great chemistry between them, the end of the second act is remarkable.

Hilarion is the most wronged character in the history of ballet, a man of pure heart and love go all out to show that such Giselle Albrecht is just a sleazy second-rate and consegue. Mas the girl is in love and when that happens it seems she can not think. Proof of Giselle that the prince is preppy boyfriend of another, or a great liar. What does he gain from it, death. Will visit the girl in his grave and take a Pataquiva of Willis who send him to the cemetery. What does heroin even after her death to the man who tried to open their eyes? Nothing, let him go to hell without remorca. But Giselle in her passion breathtaking saves the scoundrel, who lied to her saying he was poor and without compromise and caused his death. He quite ready to live and she mortinha da silva. What love can stand so dirty!

Women of my Brazil you do this?

Hilarion is represented by Martin Harvey and boy does the job perfectly. Another highlight is always exciting for the participation of Marianela Nunez, ballerina roles accepts ""small"" and turns it into huge, Myrtha its technical quality is exceptional and emotional.

The corps de ballet of the Mountbatten participation has sometimes modest, sometimes interesting

GISELLE-O BAL DA INJUSTIA

Giselle  um dos bals mais populares de todos os tempos, ganha uma nova verso em DVD gravada em 2006 com produo do teatro londrino Covent Garden.

 A msica de Adoph Adam  simples, com melodias fceis, ingnuas , as vezes at bobinhas. Mas caiu no gosto do pblico.

O compositor teve 3 semanas para compor a obra e utilizou trechos de outro bal de sua autoria, Le Pirate.

A produo do Covent Garden  impecvel, cenrio e figurino perfeitos , condizentes com o libreto.

A direo de imagens est excelente, mostra todas as cenas com clareza.

Luz de uma beleza mpar e coreografia tradicional. A orquestra regida por Boriz Cruzin tem excelente sonoridade, principalmente nas madeiras.

Alina Cojocaru est em estado de graa. Critiquei sua apresentao em Sleeping Beauty pela falta de emoo, mas nessa Giselle a bailarina mostra todo seu potencial artstico. Seu corpo e suas expresses faciais se adaptam perfeitamente a Giselle .Dana com delicadeza imprimindo uma ingnuidade a pobre moa interiorana . Sua cena da loucura que fecha o primeiro ato  de arrasar. Quando se transforma em Willis salta com beleza dando a iluso de ser um esprito atormentado.

Johan Kobborg mostra-se um Albrecht correto, suas melhores passagens esto quando faz os duetos com Giselle. Existe grande qumica entre ambos, o final do segundo ato  memorvel.

This makes for wonderful statues but detracts from any human feeling. I have seen him only in this DVD and this might be unfair but I thought future buyers deserve a warning. Top notch dancing, but for a ballet that has so much opportunity for trully moving acting, the lead male disappoints.",1246406400,5,480,4.658823529411765

Maybe it was due to the conducting. However, the audio of the blue-ray version was outstanding and rich in detail and bass response.

8295758,5,B001E08TDA,"Natalia Osipova's performance is the best I have seen of Giselle, either live or on a recording, and carries an emotional impact far greater than any other I am familiar with. Her work in the pas de deux in the second act (with Carlos Acosta) is quite astonishing, for its depth and pathos. The only other performance that comes even close to hers is also on DVD in an old recording, by the ABT's Carla Fracci. Both Carlos Acosta and Hikaru Kobayashi (as Albrecht and Myrtha, respectively) turn in very good work but it is Osipova who stands head and shoulders above them.",1474329600,,572,4.563106796116505

8295763,5,B001E08TDA,"Any production performed by The Royal Ballet is worthy of attention, but this production of Giselle is amazing from start to finish.  It features Natalia Osipova as Giselle, and Carlos Acosta as Count Albrecht.  The orchestra of the Royal Opera House for this production is conducted by Boris Gruzin, and he does a phenomenal job of balancing the needs of the orchestra with the requirements of both the score and the dancers, each becoming part of the entire experience seamlessly.  And this orchestra is wonderful in this production.
This is a performance with tremendous emotional power and vulnerability.  Ms. Osipova is heartbreakingly innocent in Act I, and her movement and expressiveness is astonishing.  But the score reveals the heartbreak that is to come, and you cannot help but be captivated by what you intrinsically feel is about to occur.  I cannot say enough about Mr. Acostas gentile and caring performance as Albrecht  he is a marvelous partner that truly highlights Ms. Osipovas performance, responding to her every nuance and making it possible for her to shine even brighter than she naturally does on her own.  And when she kills herself at the end of Act I it is emotionally affecting in a way that is difficult to describe.
Act II is simply captivating  when Giselle is drawn from her grave, it is a thing of beauty and feeling that is touchingly expressed by Ms. Osipova, and the interaction between her and Mr. Acostas Albrecht as Myrtha forces him to dance to the point of death (intriguingly portrayed by Hikaru Kobayashithe depth of her performance is astonishing), but the emotion and athleticism of Ms. Osipova is just unbelievable.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her during the end of this sequence as she saves her Albrecht.  Words are inadequate for the emotional experience contained on this Blu-Ray disc.

Both the picture and sound quality are incredible, the clarity breathtaking, and every nuance that this gifted group of performers brings forth enhances the overall experience.  This is an amazing production, and it is a treat to be able to experience it in this format.  The extras are insightful and interesting, and well worth watching.  Very highly recommended!",1438560000,,2209,4.997267759562842
8295764,5,B001E08TDA,"In my review of Osipova-Acosta I give the reasons for preferring this production of Giselle to theirs. Everything, the choreography, staging, conducting, casting, filming in this 2006 rendition are just as one would expect in what is the best ballet ever composed. Highly recommended to everyone who loves Giselle!",1438300800,,314,5.428571428571429
