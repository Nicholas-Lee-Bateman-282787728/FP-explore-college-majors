8438655,4,B004R2HPQE,"A good thriller usually does have the shocking moments that make you jump in your seat, and this movie ""kind of"" has some of those, but you have no idea who/what is scaring everyone. Is it a ghost? Is it a murderer? Is it a victim? Nothing seems to make sense. Pointless scaring is not scary at all. The story finally makes sense towards the end, but it's too late by then. Some rather unconvincing scenes are more comical than they are scary. Rati Agnihotri is a good actress, but her ghost scene is absolutely hilarious. Songs are okay. Sohail and Isha gave a decent performance.",1304035200,3,581,4.490566037735849
