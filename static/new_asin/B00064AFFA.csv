2166017,4,B00064AFFA,"This was an interesting movie to watch about a young man named Cliff who turns 18 and wants to have his first sexual experience. He meets Butch, who is a street hustler. Suddenly he is introduced into a world of sex and drugs, and the two friends wind up falling for each other, until drugs push them apart. It's a gritty movie that is sometimes disturbing, but worth watching. Coming of age is a good way to describe it, to see how Cliff is at the start of the movie, then to see the kind of person he is at the end. I thought it was a nice movie, well written and well acted.",1104019200,4,577,4.0701754385964914
2166018,4,B00064AFFA,"SUGAR is one of those films that polarizes audiences: there are those who loathe the 'bad rap' it presents of the gay underground life and there are those that are in the Bravo camps of the stars. Based on short stories by Bruce La Bruce, SUGAR takes a look at the dark side of male prostitution in Toronto, hustlers on drugs, warpy families (and lack of family), and the idiosyncrasies of johns.  And if these topics present a problem to viewers, then this is probably not a film to recommend.

However, for those who want a ground-level view of the world of male hustlers in Canada (and everywhere in the big cities around the world), then this script by Todd Klinck as directed by John Palmer rolls like a kaleidoscope of constantly changing aspects of this corner of society.

Cliff (Andre Noble) is celebrating his 18th birthday watching and acting out on his sexual confusion.  His family consists of a mother (Marnie McPhail) who at least tries to be a supportive contemporary mom, and a bizarre sister Cookie (Haylee Wanstall) who requires Ritalin to maintain some semblance of normalcy while being very in tune with the 'world' Cliff is attempting to enter.

After a birthday at home, Cliff wanders the streets of Toronto and accidentally (?) encounters a cruising site for gay hustlers, trannies, and prostitutes.  His flat affect is suddenly changed and the world that embraces his closeted gay bent opens up to him.  His eyes fall on one Butch (Brendan Fehr) and for the first time in his life he has physical contact with another person!  Butch is stunningly handsome, has a warm heart, flirts with Cliff yet warns him they cannot be anything but friends.  Cliff falls in love, follows Butch through his various johns, partakes in Butch's always expanding drug habit, and eventually is used in an encounter for one of Butch's tricks - an encounter that breaks Cliff's idealistic infatuation with a moment of reality.

From that moment the film winds down with some tragic events permanently altering Cliff's view of the world and his place in it. Yes, the story has been used before, but this time along with the expected drug use extremes and deterioration of character, Palmer stalls at significant moments to share some of the sad pathology of various johns in an understanding light.  There is a lot of sensitivity with the collection of characters in this film and that is a breath of fresh air.

The acting is generally high quality, especially from Brendan Fehr, Andre Noble, Haylee Wanstall, Marnie McPhail, and Sarah Polley.  Roles such as Butch and Cliff call for a great deal of courage on the part of actors.  While there is considerable frontal nudity on the part of the background hustlers, the 'stars' are allowed to show passion and activity without the focus being on nudity.

Though this is a dark film about a dark subject, there is enough 'light' to warrant the attention of a larger public.  You just have to really look for it!  Grady Harp, November 2004",1101686400,5,2989,4.784046692607004
2166019,1,B00064AFFA,"One positive thing about this movie, the only positive thing: Fehr did a great job acting.  Other than that, there is no redeeming quality to this movie.  I am not sure how anyone could confuse this with a love story.  All the characters are selfish, irresponsible, miserable, depraved, and sad excuses for human beings.  If you want to experience the depths of how low a man can go and still be alive, then this will satisfy.  However, unless you want a movie that will leave you depressed over how gay men are portrayed in cinema and in the world and feel like beating yourself up for no good cause-----stay away.  I am very sorry Fehr chose to make this film; I am more sorry that part of my life went to viewing it.  As a gay man, I feel it is high time to create gay cinema that has positive characters and an uplifting, hopeful message.  Not every gay man is miserable, suicidal, and drug addicted!",1101513600,13,904,4.403614457831325
2166020,5,B00064AFFA,"I was lucky enough to be able to catch this one on the big screen before I picked it up on DVD. There's been a lot said about Sugar, both good and bad. It's not an easy movie to watch - nothing is romanticized or sugar-coated (no pun intended). Director John Palmer has a way of prefacing difficult scenarios with scenes full of humor, leaving the audience emotionally off-balance for most of the film, fluctuating between highly amused and a little horrified.

One thing that's constant, however, is the collective opinion of Brendan Fehr's mind-blowing performance.

Most people know him from ""Roswell"", or from the bit parts and ensemble roles he's had in would-be blockbusters (""Biker Boyz"") and forgettable thrillers and horror flicks (""The Forsaken"", ""Christina's House""). Clearly, not the best vehicles to showcase any hidden chops. His work on Roswell often overshadowed leading man Jason Behr, and he has done some little-seen projects that really hinted at a bright future - ""Edge of Madness,"" while not a great movie by any means, made you sit up and watch him.

""Sugar"" makes it impossible for you to ignore him.

It's well-casted in general. The late Andre Noble is charming, convincingly wide-eyed and earnest. Maury Chaykin and Sarah Polley have memorable cameos. Haylee Wanstall is a natural. But it's Fehr's film, from beginning to end.

The movie isn't dialogue-heavy. It lets pointed looks and charged silences do a lot of the talking. And it takes an actor with a certain strength, a tangible presence, to pull off, without crossing the line into smarmy or just plain ridiculous. It's one of those roles that teeters on a razor's edge - the balance is so delicate, any wrong move could make the whole thing crash and burn.

What's impressive, and ultimately heart-breaking to watch, is that he's able to portray such a flawed character so flawlessly. Every note is pitch-perfect. The easy, cocky control Butch exudes in the beginning, that morphs into a  downward spiral of self-destruction, could have been easily mishandled in the hands of another actor. But Fehr slides from one end of the spectrum to the other, seemingly effortlessly, grabbing the audience and yanking them along for the painful ride. The tenderness in his scenes with Noble, the determination in his encounters with clients, the easy comic timing, even the genuine kinship in his onscreen moments with Wanstall... none of that can be taught. By the time the film reaches its conclusion, he's taken you from Butch's early, confident smirk to a lost soul's broken tears and haunted eyes, and you're not watching Brendan Fehr, actor. He's become this character, and given us a glimpse at this kid's tragic life.

Perhaps therein lies the flaw in ""Sugar."" Once Butch fades to black, you're no longer engrossed. While I'm sure the ending was meant to illustrate how he'd influenced this suburban teenager's life, perhaps changed it for the better... Butch is one of those characters, and performances, that lingers, and stays with you long after the running time is over. And as the ending unfolded, all it did was anger me on behalf of the character I'd spent the entire movie watching, discarded and forgotten too soon.",1101340800,11,3209,4.973880597014926
2166021,2,B00064AFFA,"I can't admit I really liked this film although I think Brendan Fehr did a great job with the role as a hustler who befriends a young man who is just coming into his own as a gay man.  The story is centered around Cliff (Andre Noble) but it is Fehr's acting that really gets the viewers attention.  This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  From scenes of sex with an unattractive, overweight disabled woman to a scene where Butch basically rapes Cliff for the benefit of a voyeuristic trick, the movie doesn't shy away from uncomfortable material.  Most of the movie, however, just didn't work for me.  The role of Cliff's mother wasn't very interesting  and I found the little sister, Cookie, who pill-popped Ritalin and dispensed joints like candy to be a little creepy.  Noble did fairly well with his role but I wasn't impressed with him overall.  The main reason to watch this is Brendan Fehr's performance----otherwise, not worth recommending.",1100995200,4,956,4.786585365853658
2166022,4,B00064AFFA,"Cliff (played by the late Andre Noble) has just turned 18.  Smart, younger, Ritalin-popping sister Cookie (Haylee Wanstall) gives him a helpful push to go out into the big city (Toronto) to find sex.  Emerging from the subway and riding his new skateboard, Cliff scoots off to a hustling district and catches the eye of one of the pros, Butch (Brendan Fehr), a drug-taker.  Virgin Cliff decides almost immediately that he wants a relationship with Butch and even brings him home after the first night's encounter.  The relationship has its ups and downs, but the audience gets to see Butch (and, to a lesser extent, Cliff) operate in the hustler world at a benignly kinky, more-than-vanilla, level but at less than the heights of depravity shown in ""Mandragora."" The two have a good chemistry, especially in the (shortened from the VHS version) breakfast and photo-discussing scenes.  Cliff wants romance, not hustling; Butch has some ambivalence toward Cliff.  The plot moves toward an inevitable result, followed by a twist at the end that shows where Cliff really is.

Cliff and Butch show good skin and are both good lookers.  There are four hustler characters who show more.  It all seems realistic and fairly presented.

I found the hustling side-stories the most interesting part of the movie. Butch, Cliff, and Cookie are the most memorably acted characters. The main love story seemed rushed at the beginning.  Although I would have liked a little more on Cliff's motivation, one can make enough sense of it all.  The initial scenes feel too formulaic; the viewer just has to last past them.

""Sugar"" is an interesting, offbeat film despite some soft spots.  There are no extras at all.  Low 4 rating.",1100908800,120,1710,4.93006993006993
2166023,4,B00064AFFA,"Do not be put off by the first 10 minutes of this film: it screams: ""bad script, bad direction, low production values, independent crap, etc.""

Not only does it become interesting, Brendan Fehr's appearance lifts this script and by the end, you will be dropping your jaw at a mindboggling performance. Whatever real-life reluctance Fehr had playing a male prostitute disappeared when the camera rolled.

Reportedly, Fehr attended the premier but didn't stay to watch the film and when asked about his acting technique said ""I just read the words."" No, he doesn't just read the words. I had no idea this guy had such chops.  If you know him from the Roswell TV series, you do NOT know him.  He's been in a couple of clunkers that were extensions of his ""mood"" acting as Michael Guerin.  None of that here; he has completely broken away. I cringe at comparing him to a young Johnny Depp, but if he keeps this up.... Its difficult to chew up the scenery without misstepping but he pulls it off in the final scenes which were so easy to get wrong.

His co-star, charming Andre Noble (who died of accidental poisoning in the summer of 2004) is solid as well, and there is a surprisingly good performance from 11-yr. old Haylee Wanstall.

This is the unrated version and there is much adult material here including frontal nudity, although not from either of the two leads. This is Fehr's best work to date. Clearly he deserves better material; what is amazing is the skill with which he created believability for his character. Taking this role was gutsy at many levels. The film isn't worth 4 stars, but I gave it four because of Fehr and Noble.",1100822400,11,1641,4.618556701030927

2166041,4,B00064AFFA,"Inspired by Bruce La Bruce's short stories, Tom Palmer's daring film ventures into a world of male prostitution, heavy drugs and depravation.

In the first minute of ""Sugar"" 18-year-old Cliff, the protagonist, stares at a boy kissing his girlfriend. Cliff is there as a voyeur, as his presence irrupts the intimacy of a couple, but he is also there to acquire the necessary visual stimulation to masturbate afterwards. Regarded from the very beginning, the order of the phantasm mediates the relationship between the protagonist and his world.

And what world is that? There is the nice house with the white picket fences which conforms reality and there is also the real, which Cliff encounters as he heads downtown and arrives in a place in which prostitution, she-males and drugs are the norm; why is that the 'real'? Because it exceeds and surpasses reality, but at the same time is excrementitiously derived from that reality. It is in this environment that he meets a handsome hustler named Butch.

If, according to Lacan, the desire comes from the real as it cannot be fully articulated or tamed by language, then it's understandable that Cliff will bond with Butch through the phantasm. What are the implications? That he doesn't know anything about this male prostitute, and yet he is very attracted to him. Deep inside, Cliff trusts in the possibility of a successful relationship with Butch. But is it possible to maintain a healthy rapport with someone whose motivations remain unclear? Butch considers himself an actor, after all, he has to reenact the fantasies of his clients. He seems to specialize in seriously disturbed individuals that have banned themselves from normal pleasure and instead aim subconsciously for their particular phantasms (the abusive father, the strong macho, the hockey player, etc.). According to Freud not all libido can be transferred into the image, there are limits. The recognition of ourselves and our bodies, in which conscious knowledge is modeled, bears great limitations, because something eludes this primitive libidinal investment that shapes the image of the ideal ego; there is a portion of libido that cannot be transferred into the image, neither in the image of my body nor in the image of my partner, remaining instead invested at the level of one's own body in a non-specular way, avoiding the laws of representation. When Butch's clients rely entirely on this young man to relive their fantasies they fail at obtaining pleasure, because as Freud explains, they're trying to put all their libido in an image, in a specular representation of their past which obviously doesn't work in the present.

Perhaps dominated by the real, the clandestine world of drugs and illegal activities, Butch has no option but to keep doing the things he knows how to do best. Cliff's mistake, however, is to enter into this ambit of the real, turning his back on a more familiar (and familial) reality. Cliff sleeps with his friend in the same bed, but they do not touch each other. They masturbate in front of each other, but they do not have sex. Cliff fills the void in his life, his lack of a loving partner, with the phantasm of something that's clearly not there. But what happens when Butch gets violent and crosses the line? Somehow, adopting the phantasm is easy, but when Cliff finds himself occupying the role of the 'object a', when he finds himself turning into Butch's phantasm, an already feeble relationship starts to unravel.",1318032000,,3485,4.993115318416523
2166042,4,B00064AFFA,"This is a coming of age story that is both comedic and yet full of tragedy. Based on a Bruce LaBruce short story it is set and made in downtown Toronto. The hero turns 18 and his sister gives him a bottle of vodka, a joint and instructions to get laid. Andre Noble (Cliff) does just that (he sadly dies shortly after the making of this film). He meets 'hustler' or more accurately 'rent boy' 'Butch' played by Brendan Fehr, who puts in an outstanding performance (and I don't mean on the night as those more smut minded readers might infer).

They start a relationship of sorts and Butch meets the family and then starts taking Cliff to his regular tricks. All of this is fuelled by increasingly large numbers of narcotics which point toward a hedonistic lifestyle which belies that the need to block out the world is because you are not happy living in it.

Following a voyeur inspired 'rape', their relationship comes apart and Butch spirals ever downward with tragic consequences. This is a tottally belivable film and all the parts are played with true conviction, I found it completely compelling and can only recommend it. Some excellent supporting actors too especially the rag tag whores and lady boys and drug dealers, so not really a 'family film' this.",1303430400,,1263,4.684684684684685

Then there was the beating and using of the older men by the 2 actors, which streched limits further but still not too bad.

I am no naif and I understand that society has an underbelly in which realy nasty people reside, but why is it gay indies insist on only showing us the underbelly?  Are gay film writers and producers so self-loathing that they can't find positive characters and plots...hence ""O Fantasma"", ""Chuck and Buck"" and countless others.  Is the gay community populated exclusively by hustlers and druggies?  Am I so far out of the loop that this distresses me?

Is it unreasonable to be bothered by the idea that a pre-teen girl knows more about drug dealing than anyone else in the film?  Is it too much to expect to see a parent who takes responsibility for rearing children with a certan degree and love, care and consideration?  Is it too much to ask that a coming-of-age gay character be attracted to other characters that are NOT neurotic druggie hustlers who do nothing but continue to slide of the deep end?

Am I too much of a prude to hope that gay romance isn't always proven with a one-night-stand in a men's room stall while one character's little sister is outside waiting for him?

Call it gritty or arty if you will, if that's what the gay community expects from itself.  I personally believe the gay community demands more and wants more integrity and positive imagery.",1238716800,2,1484,4.622137404580153

2166077,3,B00064AFFA,"I am not sad I brought Sugar but, it is not awesome by any stretch of the imagination.  A DVD called Johns also sold here on AMAZON.com is far and away a better choice in this area.  Johns shares the same basic subject matter street hustlers who find what proves eventually to be traggic love.  Johns has low budget movie issues but overcomes them very creatively becoming very realistic in the process.  Johns is also a similiar story of street life shared by two friends complete with bitter sweet ending but Johns is a far better story told in far more effective interesting ways.

I am not saying Sugar is bad it is just not entirely good especially for the money it costs.  Sugar at times is very good but thats the problem those times of greatness come between long stretches of vaccuous slow pacing, lame scenes talking about nothing and uninteresting unrelated or stupid overly simplistic plot points driven home with a sledge hammer.  Case in point the breakfast table scene where the two dudes have a spot of sexual fun, the camera remains pretty static changing scenes only barely during the goings on.

A good movie would have used a dizzying series of different angle shots intermixed with fast cuts appropriate music scoring and sounds to bring a certain dynamism even sick humor to the event that would have left the audience tired as if they were drawn into the action.  Sugar turned what should have been a very exciting scene into a moment where any intelligent audience was hoping ok ok get it over with already can't cha.  Sugar never hits that place most movies get to that allows you to suspend beleif and dive headfirst into the plot of the picture.

Just when you were getting into BELEIVING in Sugar the storyline would do something stupid that insulted your intellegence so totally that the little voice in your head that scans for UNREAL SITUATIONS screams out come on GIVE ME A BREAK FOR GOODNESS SAKE!  It was as if Sugar's writer could not think of how to fill in parts of the story line so he just threw anything in he could just to use up remaining film time.

Examples of things that just did not work.  The talk at the breakfast table one the dialogue was so slowly paced it was deadly, two they were not talking about anything that really offered any insight about the characters. The conversation did NOT add any true demension to the storyline they were just empty words to just take up space.  Three the characters were not inspired or animated and did not really seem to truly like each other at any point in the picture.  Theirs seemed more a business relationship rather than being anything one could remotely call a loving relationship.

Character development in the SUGAR is pretty much absent beyond the most obvious, banal and completely superficial aspects of life.  The little girl drug dealer was really off the wall and seems too worldly forced and unreal for her tender age.  The mom was not beleivable straddling the hip pot smoking mom and saintly june cleaver in perfect suburbia fence.  Everything in the movie might had worked if it were handled and developed with a deft skilled subtle hand in instead pure brutish force.

I am mentally slow due to cognitive and other disabilities so I generally do not mind when a movie moves slowly but this movie crept along so slow its lack of any pacing irked even me.

The thing I noticed most about this movie was it never made you like the characters, it never made you invest any part of yourself in any of the characters.  The movie did not in any way draw you in and make you forget you were watching DVD.  Unlike this DVD really good movies even low budget ones quickly grab and develop viewer interest as a means to transport audiences from mere passive watcher to interested third party for whom this drama is unfolding.

The very best movies make you feel as if you are almost a part of its goings on and Sugar did none of the things great movies do.  A few of the sets were sparse and uninspired especially the ""sex watcher dude's apartment"".  He sat there a shallow empty unrealistic uninspired character saying next to nothing by a stark blank white  wall yet he lived in this posh tall tower of obviously upscale apartments and his home had NO sense of this rich mans personality or ego.  His apartment\condo gave no insight into what kind of man he was as such he like all the other charcters in Sugar clung to a one demensional quality as if it was a holy grail.

I guess thats what I honestly did not like about sugar is with few exceptions the people and places in Sugar were so totally one demensional.  A movie is like an invitation to lose yourself in another world for a period of time and when a movie characters places and sounds lack the depth, power and emotion to carry you away the audience is left feeling cheated as is the case with Sugar.

Why did I give Sugar three stars if it was so bad.  Sugar gets its three stars because the few places where the movie was done well it really shines.  It has like four really awesome scenes in it that come across as pretty real.  When Butch a street tough goes off on drugs and starts acting really zapped out that felt fairly real.  The two old freaky men talking felt sort of real.  The surealistic scenes of the corpse of Butch talking seemed real.  The sex scene with the morbidly obese lady while totally gross felt real and was funny too.  The sex betrayal scene between butch and his friend in the watcher dudes posh apartment felt sort of real.  Just like I say in my tag Sugar has a few legitimate high energy rush moments where everything comes together, it is really funny \ real and it works but most of the movie is slow plainfully plodding emptiness where the audience is thinking ok ok ok move on already.

Honestly I gave the movie 3 stars because those few fast high points on the unrated version of this Sugar rock and are worth its price but in reality this Sugar is only SEMI-SWEET at best and by giving This Semi Sweet SUGAR three stars the Wolf of ALPHASPACE is being kind.",1134000000,28,6061,4.493613138686132
2166078,3,B00064AFFA,"Almost worth getting for the hotness that is Brendan Fehr, plus the unexpected cutie Andre Noble (which I wouldn't have thought so much from the cover); however, their isn't nearly enough skin shown by the two. Plus, the one sex scene between them typifies the entire movie for me: far more brutal and corse than beautiful and endearing.

If you think you're getting a tender coming of age/boy's first time movie where he falls in love and recuses the down and out hustler guy with lots (as in more than one excuse for) sex scenes, then you're in for a BIG disappointment.

None of which is to say its a bad movie. The little sister Cookie is a total hoot and probably the most interesting character overall actually. Queer As Folk fans will recognize Cliff's wonderful Mother as being the same actress who played Hunter's evil mom.

It is to say, rent this first before you decide to buy. Otherwise you might be stuck with a movie you'll only ever watch once. (All the way through anyway ;)",1127001600,19,991,4.556179775280899

Brendan Fehr is a believable gay junkie - not an easy role to take on, let alone portray well.

My hat's off to Brendan's acting ability. Bravo.

2166082,2,B00064AFFA,"""Sugar"" is an interesting name for this strange, awkward, ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads.  While they carry the film over it's editing, direction, and story hurdles, they can't make up for its unevenness.

Plus the story is entirely too cliche, and I couldn't help thinking it was essentially the same story as ""Circuit,"" albeit in a different venue (except I enjoyed Circuit.)  I couldn't get into this film.

Why not?  The story lurches around and you are left to wonder ""why"" and ""how"" altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse.  Something in the description of this film claims it's funny.  I guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny, then you will get a good laugh out of this.  I kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile.  Not so much.

I'd recommend ""Circuit"" to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines, and I'd leave this film on the shelf.  It's redeeeming qualities are few.",1119657600,9,1100,5.055555555555555
2166083,1,B00064AFFA,"The premise looked like it had some promise, but I ultimately destroyed the DVD after I watched it b/c I thought it was so unpleasant and implausible.  (I usually have a high tolerance for films compared to my friends.)

The more I considered this film, the less I liked it.  Seemed as if there was some sadism and internalized homophobia involved in the screenwriter's mind.

The film focuses on the ""relationship"" between a very messed up teen hustler who has a nasty drug habit and very few morals and his fawning teen hanger-on (NOT a friend in any real sense).  They basically hang out together, do drugs, develop no intimacy, oh and there's a nasty rape scene that is patently offensive.  It paints a pretty nasty view of gay life when positive views are both more representative and functional for people to watch.

It's hard to imagine NOT being offended (and not in a thought-provoking way, either) by this film.  It was poorly written, not very interesting to watch, and not sexy.  Usually if I thought a film was ok, I'll keep it or give it away.  This I destroyed b/c I did't want to abet the sentiments expressed therein.

Over an hour later, as the credit rolled, I asked myself why I actually paid for this movie. Yeah, there are a couple of nice skin shots, but the drug use, manic behavior are just beyond me. Maybe I'm not abstract enough to get the point. This movie isn't nearly as endearing as I thought it would be.",1117843200,12,566,4.25

This movie, LATTER DAYS and NEVERLAND (the gay-themed Peter Pan movie - not the Johnny Depp movie!) have the sexiest guys ever. I highly recommend these three movies if you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies.

2166107,4,B00064AFFA,"A lot of people become comfortable with the a-typical portrayal of gay life in film, a world of shiny disco balls, hard muscles, night clubs and fabulous clothes. Viewers are drawn into the monotomy of leads who are pining for love, struggling with acceptance and deal with tragic coming out stories but most of the time these tales seem to wrap things up nice and neatly in the end with our heroes finding love, triumphing over diversity and finding love and acceptance in some way.

  This is not that movie and for some that is a bitter pill to swallow, but for some of us (who have swallowed many a bitter pill in our time) this movie is more real than any of those others.

  Sugar is about falling in love with the bad boy and falling in with an unforgiving scene. Its about partying but not every rail rockin' weekend begins and ends with house music. Sometimes the party scene is a very dark very real world where you have to either fight against the current to survive or get swept away with the tide. Sugar is meant to be dark and ugly at times.

  Me and my friends watched it with smiles, grimaces and an all too grave understanding of what the two main leads in the film were going through. A poignant scene towards the end will make anyone who has indulged to the point of excess relate to the gravity of the moment the two boys are in.

  My only beef with this film was that the temporal sense was off. It was sometimes difficult to gauge how much time had passed between scenes and you have to pay attention to tiny details hidden in the background to clarify time, which can be difficult for some due to the powerful and raw look of this film.

  People keep trying to compare this film to others in the genre, but my advice is that if you liked the movies Kids and Johns, then you'd like this film. If you like to keep your queeroverse tidy and happy with a fun back beat then steer clear.",1111536000,16,1908,4.290502793296089

2166109,2,B00064AFFA,"The story of Sugar is dismal, dark and just foolish. The short story by Bruce LeBruce tells about an 18 year old Cliff (Andre Noble) who goes out one night for some fun away from his boring suburban family and finds Butch (Brendan Fehr) a male addict and hustler. Somehow through the director John Palmer, or the writer the storyline blurs from coming of age, to the dangers of drugs to the grimy life of a prostitute. Fehr and Noble do a fair job navigating through this dysfunctional script, but the real joy and much needed comic relief was Cookie (Haylee Wanstall), the younger sister of Cliff who is always able to produce liquior and pot (you never know were she gets it from). However, even with the three actors helping float this mess, the script is to riddled with unbelievable holes...Cliff leaving his safe suburban area and heads directly to the sketchiest part of a city or finding a street hustler that wants to be your friend even if you don't pay him (to mention a few) .

2166110,5,B00064AFFA,"The recent tragic death of actor Andre Noble leaves a void that cannot be replaced. But thankfully he has left his mark in this beautifully directed film. Sugar reminds me of ""My private Idaho"" in terms of directing and mood. While the former film had River Phoenix, who made the film so sexy, this film has Andre Noble. Noble had an acting style that revealed passion and emotion with a sexual edge. Playing an 18 year old gay teen who is anxious to have his first sexual encounter, he falls for Butch, a gay street hustler(played well by Brendan Fehr). But this is clearly Noble's film. His heart breaking performance is so real and gripping, and he seemed so destined for super stardom. Beautiful eyes, gorgeous hair and a smile that would break a million hearts, his death leaves the film industry without his raw talent and that is a shame. I would rate this film as an indie classic. It really hit home for me. I hope straight viewers keep an open mind while viewing as Andre truly gives a performance worth seeing again and again.",1105056000,83,1037,4.550802139037433
