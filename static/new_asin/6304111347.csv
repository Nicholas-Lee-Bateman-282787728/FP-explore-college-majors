783744,5,6304111347,"Many actors served honorably in the armed forces during WW2, with Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy all rising to high rank.  Most, when they returned, tried to slide back quietly into film making.  Clark Gable,  for instance, made a good but fluffy film with Doris Day.  Tracy, however,  jumped back with a controversial film about race hatred that has become a  classic.  It actually affected the English Language (the tired businessman  tells his wife ""I had a bad day at Black Rock at the office!"")  Tracy plays a one-armed returning veteran with a medal for the father of a  Japanese-American comrade.  In Black Rock, he finds a trio of real baddies  in Robert Ryan, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine.  The surprising scene in  the town diner between Tracy and Borgnine is worth the price of admission.  The cast is outstanding, including Walter Brennan, Dean Jagger, and Anne  Francis.  What a great return to film for Tracy!",931910400,2,939,4.841772151898734

783882,5,6304111347,"This is a superb tension-filled film with very good acting depicting the effects of racial hatred in the US against the Japanese. It stars Spencer Tracy (1900-1967) who won an Academy Award for Captain Courageous in 1937 and Boys Town in 1938. He was nominated but did not win for this film in 1955. He plays a one arm man, wounded during the war, who comes to an extremely small town, only about one street long, in 1945, just after World War II. He does not reveal why he came and the film does not let us know until the end. He tells the inhabitants that he is looking for a Japanese man, and gives his name. All of the few inhabitants of the town are hostile to him. Soon they try to kill him. The inhabitants are obviously trying to hide a secret from him. Something happened to the Japanese man four years ago. After being unable to find out what happened to the Japanese man, Tracy decides to leave, but the town people do not let him leave. They intend to kill him to keep their secret.",1514419200,,994,4.264550264550264
783883,5,6304111347,"Spencer Tracy at his best. The up and coming Lee Marvin, as well as Earnest Borgnine, Anne Francis and Dean Jagger. In addition, Walter Brennan two years before his famous role in TV's ""The Real McCoys"" and Robert Ryan in the villains role.  The score by Andre Previn perfectly sets the tone and drama within the film and John Sturges masterful direction gives the film its mood.  Despite Sturges' reputation for westerns, this film is not one of them.  Though set in the west, it is a suspense drama often with a slow pace that enhances the story line.  Released by MGM in 1955 in color and CinemaScope, the tale takes place ten years earlier.  It begins when a one arm character played by Tracy steps off a train in a desert stop where it hasn't stopped in four years. This stranger is unwelcome in this town which has a secret that those living there would prefer to keep.  What happens next is a secret that I wish to keep in order not to spoil the rest of the story.  If you're a fan of special effects, CGI, or fast action . . .  forget about this movie.  It plays tough, gritty, suspenseful and even mean, because of good writing, directing and acting.  So, sit down and buckle yourself in for a real thriller .",1514160000,2,1218,4.373333333333333

783961,3,6304111347,"RELEASED IN 1955 and directed by John Sturges, ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is a crime drama/mystery/western taking place in 1945 about a one-armed old man (Spencer Tracy) who travels to a remote desert town to see a man named Komoko, but is antagonized by the citizenry to the point of fearing for his life. Why are they so paranoid? What are they hiding?

This is an all-star movie (also featuring Robert Ryan, Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, etc.) with a big reputation. Its a slow-build crime drama interspersed with occasional thrills. But its burdened by an unbelievable protagonist: Tracy was 54 during filming and easily looked 10-12 years older. Are we to buy the idea that he just got back from Italy fighting in WWII? Is it credible that he could so easily take down a burly antagonist with a few karate chops and judo? The stunning Anne Francis appears in a minor female role.

THE FILM RUNS 81 minutes and was shot at Alabama Hill, Jamestown, Lone Pine & Culver City (studio), California; plus the Mojave Desert, Arizona. WRITERS: Millard Kaufman & Don McGuire wrote the script based on Howard Breslins short story.

784088,5,6304111347,"Director John Sturges received his one and only Oscar nomination as Best Director for his tour-de-force modern-day western masterpiece of suspense and tension, ""Bad Day at Black Rock."" The superb cast boasts the incomparable Spencer Tracy along with Robert Ryan, Walter Brennan, Ernst Borgnine, John Ericson, Lee Marvin,Dean Jagger, and Anne Francis. The theme of xenophobia dominates this brisk, straight-forward 81-minute, widescreen thriller that qualifies as a hybrid of the social problem picture, the western, the martial arts actioneer, and the war movie. Tracy also received an Oscar nomination as the one-armed hero who finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place in Black Rock. Like the traditional western hero, the Tracy protagonist has no idea what he is facing until it is too late to scram. The introductory credit sequence of ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" occurs over several dynamic aerial long shots of a train racing through the arid desolation of a southwestern desert. These aerial shots and composer Andre Previn's bombastic music convey the momentous urgency of the train. Sturges told me in an interview that the aerial footage was filmed backwards with a helicopter in front of the train before it ascended. In other words, Sturges reversed the film so we find ourselves plunging out of the heavens toward a train below and suddenly confront it. Basically, ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" opens with this attention-getting device. Moreover, these vivid images visually establish the isolation of Black Rock and concretely provide us a feeling for the setting.

As the train conductor alights with John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy), he observes that Black Rock's inhabitants have a ""woebegone and faraway"" look. The importance of the isolation is dramatized again later when Macreedy tries to summon help from beyond Black Rock. Our crippled protagonist finds himself cut off from the rest of civilization by the desert, and he cannot use a telephone or telegraph to contact the authorities because the villains control both. Consequently, Macreedy must battle the villains on their own turf as well as on their own terms without hope of outside support. Macreedy is one of those vulnerable Sturges heroes who is up to his neck in trouble from the outset.

As he gets off the train, Macreedy informs the conductor he plans to spend 24 hours in Black Rock. ""That could be a life time,"" the conductor shrugs. Neither Macreedy nor we can appreciate the conductor's ominous words. Mr. Hastings (Russell Collins), the telegraph operator, cannot believe his eyes. The Streamliner has never once stopped in Black Rock, and he assures Macreedy that somebody must have made a mistake. Macreedy's arrival in Black Rock arouses the suspicions of everybody, particularly local hunter Reno Smith. Downstairs in the hotel where Macreedy has registered, the citizens speculate about him. Sam, the caf owner, comments, ""He walks light for a big man."" Sturges and Kaufmann introduce several details about Macreedy's character to explain and to foreshadow many of his actions when he later fights the villains. This use of incidental characterization throughout the film doesn't impede the flow of the action. Sam asks Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), the local mortician who doubles as a veterinarian, what he thinks about Macreedy.

As Doc observes, Macreedy is ""no salesman unless he's peddling dynamite."" When Sam suggests Macreedy may be a policeman, Doc is frankly incredulous. ""You ever see a cop with a stiff arm?"" Nothing may be wrong with his arm, Sam argues, perhaps he is just holding onto something tight in his pocket. Now, Doc responds with sarcasm, ""Like what? A pistol? A stick of TNT to blow up the whole mangy town?"" Meanwhile, Hector slips up into Macreedy's room and waits for him. The two duel with words as Hector tries to prod Macreedy. Macreedy descends after his encounter with Hector and informs Pete (John Ericson) that he will remain in his new room for 24-hours. Macreedy searches for the local sheriff, Tim (Dean Jagger), but Tim refuses to give him the directions for Adobe Flats.

One of Sturges' favorite scenes is the impromptu meeting Reno Smith holds outside at the railroad crossing with his conspirators. ""I know those maimed guys,"" he refers to Macreedy. ""Their minds get twisted. They put on hair shirts and act like martyrs. All of them are do-gooders, freaks, and trouble-makers."" The conspirators' episode is interesting not only for the dialogue but also for the way that Sturges and lensers William C. Mellor have staged the scene outside.

Against Reno Smith's advice, Liz Worth (Ann Francis) rents Macreedy an Army jeep to visit Adobe Flats. Macreedy finds wildflowers growing, but on the way back he runs into ornery Colely who tries to drive Macreedy off the road. Once he gets back into town, Macreedy explains to Reno that he lost the use of his arm in Italy during World War II and that he has come to Black Rock to see Komoko, a Japanese farmer.

Smith fears Macreedy now, even more so when a telegram to L.A. provides no details about him. Macreedy feels distinctively isolated and in fear for his life. He sends a telegram to the State Police, but of course Hastings never sends it.

Although he had sided with Reno and company, Pete changes his mind and arranges for Macreedy to get out of town. Liz wheels up in the jeep and Macreedy jumps in, little suspecting the surprise in store for him. The hero in ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is outnumbered and his survival depends entirely on his ability to improvise as he does in the finale when he concocts a Molotov cocktail out of whiskey bottle and the jeep.

""Black Day at Black Rock"" is a great movie with taut tension and terrific performances.",1498003200,4,5744,4.976041666666666

784274,5,6304111347,"A short movie by today's standards (1 hour, 22 minutes), 'Bad Day at Black Rock' is a really good movie that stands the test of time.  Suspenseful movie with top notch actors such as Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Walter Brennan, Dean Jagger, an early Lee Marvin, and many others.  The characters are well drawn.  We get tense exchanges leading to gradual revelations and a dramatic climax.  From the moment Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) steps off the train in the dusty, old west town of Black Rock, just after World War II has ended in 1945, everyone in the town is immediately suspicious, and virtually no one gives him a chance.  Why?  Well... there is a secret the town holds.  And...according to the train's conductor, the Streamliner hasn't stopped in Black Rock for four years, so the sight of Macreedy popped in well-dressed and not knowing anyone in town quickly grabs attention.

Robert Ryan plays the villain, a man named Reno, who owns the town the way the Godfather owns the Mafia.  His character, of course, takes an instant dislike to Macreedy and calls a private detective in Los Angeles to get the scoop on him.  When nothing turns up, Reno gives one of his henchmen (Ernest Borgnine) the green light to get rid of Macreedy, who now suspects the people in Black Rock are harboring a terrible secret.  Intimidation doesn't work with Macreedy - and the suspense builds...

As always, though, Spencer Tracy is crucial to making this a 5-star movie.  His acting, is invisible, he IS the character.  This earned Tracy an Oscar nomination.

784506,4,6304111347,"No question the internment of every Japanese person who could be found on the West Coast during the early days of World War II whatever their beliefs, whatever their loyalty to America, aided by the highest court in the land, the U.S. Supreme Court rubber-stamping that executive decision, was a dark day for the vaunted American values and adherence to a belief in civil liberties. (And if anybody wants to say that the governmental action then was an aberration look at the plight of most Moslems here these days in post-9/11 America.) Despite that injustice one would not assume that those actions would be the backdrop for a 1955 film, Bad Day At Bad Rock, which obliquely addresses the whole question in a dramatic way.

John MacCreedy, played by Spenser Tracy, is a man on a mission, an undisclosed mission through most of the film, as he gets off the train in some Podunk town in the Southwest. This town, like a lot of towns which are isolated out in the sticks, and insulated too, had citizens very unfriendly to our man. All he wants is to be able to contact a resident of the town, a Japanese-American, in the immediate post-World War II period. This fact sets off a train of events that by the end will make it very dicey about whether MacCreedy will get out of the town alive. But before that he stirs up some hidden past that many of the townspeople are trying to forget-or at least not rake up again. The leader of this town, a large ranch owner named Reno Smith, played by Robert Ryan, orchestrates the negative attitude that MacCreedy finds at every turn as he doggedly looks for that missing Japanese man whom he wants to find. At the beginning everybody, standing in fear of Reno, or indifferent to MacCreedy fate, stonewalls him at every point. Then slowly as the injustices to his person mount up and the citizens get tired of Renos overweening antics a few brave souls help MacCreedy. But in Renos eyes MacCreedy is a loose cannon, has to be gotten rid of-and fast.

The attempts to murder MacCreedy, there is no other way to put the matter, naturally failed as Reno went down, literally, in a blaze of fire. You might ask why Reno and his accomplices were so adamant about kicking MacCreedy out of town. After Pearl Harbor Renos hatred of Japs was uncontrollable (especially after he was turned down when he tried to enlist) and after a drunken spree he had killed the Jap. That madness known to the residents either through direct knowledge or fear, was why the townspeople were so suspicious of MacCreedy. And Macs mission-to give a Japanese father the posthumous medal his son had won saving MacCreedys life in Italy where laid down his head as an American soldier (there actually was a famous Japanese unit that fought all the battles in Italy and grabbed a ton of medals and commendations. Nice plot-line to make that point-a point that bears repeating today.",1481846400,2,2887,4.64774951076321

784754,4,6304111347,"Personally, I enjoyed this movie very much.  I cannot help but wonder if younger viewers may not enjoy this movie as much as I, an older person, enjoys it.  I enjoy very much working and associating with younger persons.  In those interactions I often discover how much my perceptions are dated.  Most recently I was shocked in conversing with a younger person who had no idea who Frank Sinatra is.

This movie is loaded with Hollywood icons.  Spencer Tracey is at the top of the list.  That is just the beginning.  Dean Jagger, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Walter Brennan, Ernest Borgnine, are all iconic actors.  For a true fan of Hollywood history, all of these actors are worth studying in their own right.

Additionally this movie has what may be the first Hollywood martial arts scene.  That may be not that big of a deal, but it is a further reason to watch this movie as a part of Hollywood history, especially if one enjoys martial art movies.

Maybe, most importantly, this movie is another in a line of post World War II movies containing civil rights themes.  After World War II ended there emerged a series of novels and movies about various themes about civil rights,  I would point to Crossfire and Gentleman's Agreement as examples of movies.  Both of those movies were based on novels, The Brick Foxhole and Gentleman's Agreement.  These works of performing arts paralleled the modern civil rights movement.  Coincidentally, Robert Ryan, a man known to be keenly aware of social justice issues, also played a villain in Crossfire.

For all of the above reasons, there is no doubt that this movie is a ""must see"" for any student of Hollywood film history.  Thank You...",1463097600,,1681,4.73448275862069

784853,1,6304111347,"Over the years, I had heard about this film many times. I purchased it a while ago. Yesterday evening I watched this film. I felt I was in a stupor. Perhaps I had had a stroke and was unaware of what had happened. So, having a streak of masochism in my flawed personality, I watched the movie...AGAIN.  What I was desperately attempting to decide was which adjective I might employ, which word might be 'le mot just': Improbable, or Impossible. This was a desert setting. The director and cast was already half-way there. With a change in stage sets, and a complete change of props and wardrobe, this improbable cast would then be...on Mars!  Yes, we would need a new plot line, a new script to be sure. But at least, THEN, I would know I was looking at a Science Fiction film. And I might have enjoyed it because my suspension of disbelief would not be totally overcome and devastated.
How in hell could ANYONE have made this film? Let alone the legendary SPENCER TRACY, AND a cast of well-known actors...and actress.
A bunch of solitary men living in a ghost town with one lovely young woman among them?  What did they eat? How did they live? How did they not lose their minds? What were they doing out there anyway, baiting Buzzards? Why did Anne Francis not take one look at where she was, and then at this motley crew assembled, get her Jeep key and say, in a loud and commanding voice, ""I'm outta here!!""

I AM sorry. Maybe I'm missing something here.  But there are hundreds of small budget indy films that blow ""Bad Day At Black Rock"" into the weeds.  There is such a monumental sensation of improbability in this film from start to finish that I sit here with my mouth wide open in disbelief as I have read through these reviews listed herein, all of them 4 or five stars!  And, yes, I did read them all after I finished watching this mess of a movie, not once, but two times!
I consider myself a more than averagely well-educated, well-read, well-traveled person, but I have to confess that this film has left me completely puzzled. And THEN, for Cliff Robertson to shoot this sole ditzy woman, because 'He had to start somewhere'. What in the name of Heaven!
It was a Bad Day At Black Rock indeed when this crew showed up there to make this film. A Very Bad Day. The only perhaps redeeming factor was the excellent footage of this beautiful 'Super Liner' of its day, hi-balling it down these miles of die-straight tracks. We are poorer for having lost that era of the Santa-Fe Super Chief. I rode on that wondrous train as a little boy, and the entire experience, to include this outstanding cabin steward, bending and solemnly shaking my hand still resides in my memory.  Unfortunately, Bad Day At Black Rock will also remain in my memory until my dying day.

785218,1,6304111347,"I bought this movie because it was on a list of the very best westerns, and I was very disappointed, as this narrative about big city liberals, who are as smart as they are virtuous, confront small-town Americans, who are as stupid as they are vicious.  The plot concerns a multicultural liberal who stumbles upon a murder of a Japanese fellow carried out, or know to, the entire town.

There is also a strong feminist element present.  The town's gas station and garage is run by the only female in the film, and a pretty blonde at that.  Things go well for her as long as she helps out the liberal protagonist, but start going badly when she sides with her own people--who, of course, are very bad people.

This movie isn't a western so much as the way big city liberals see small-town and rural Americans.  We are to be viewed with suspicion because we are racist, misogynist, and generally stupid, and not to be trusted--at least until we convert to the One True Faith of multicultural liberalism, as several of the characters did--and even then, we are suspect.

Have you ever seen a topic trampled to death, a scene duplicated so many times you could scream, an overkill of meanies, ne'er do wells, and evil doers? Well you are in luck with this gem! I was extremely unaware concerning the unfair cruel treatment of Japanese Americans in the Western US. What an educational opportunity to give just a simple glimpse of what horrors were incurred by these people. No, we get the same tired reaction with almost every character to an aged disabled one armed er, bandit???

The Jeep chase scene was ridiculously gratuitous and if they wanted the chap to high tail it, why not offer him a ride to Roswell???? Typically in most scripts, when you have a deep secret to hide, everyone plays over the top sweet and accommodating to DISTRACT the lone assassin. But here suspicion is aroused minute one, upon arrival in Black Rock and this deepens in every scene with gleeful repetition, BORING!

The saving grace of revenge is the judo match with Ernest and here lies the mystery of the entire film! Where did he learn those Bruce Lee moves??? They certainly did not teach that in Basic! Spence leans towards white on white, so any inclination towards a mixed heritage is sorely lost on his character.

This film had such a great opportunity to educate the masses concerning racism against Japanese Americans and failed miserably. I did find Tracy's acting superb and can recommend solely for this aspect.",1391299200,2,1476,4.776470588235294

Despite its hokey title, Bad Day at Black Rock is a first-rate attraction. It's a classic ""stranger rides into town"" story, because the stranger's arrival challenges or changes the lives of all concerned, and not necessarily for the better. Spencer Tracy is the stranger, a war veteran with a bum left arm who arrives at a small desert rail stop to deliver something to a resident of the town, a Japanese-American who, he discovers, has disappeared mysteriously. His presence provokes suspicion and eventually exposes the collective guilt of the residents, some of whom react violently. The strong supporting cast includes Lee Marvin, Dean Jagger, Anne Francis, Walter Brennan, Robert Ryan - and Borgnine. Director John Sturges used the Nevada desert locales and the CinemaScope widescreen format to perfection, particularly in the thrilling opening sequence, one of the first ever shot from a helicopter, of the train's arrival.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1380758400,,1375,6.166666666666667

785714,5,6304111347,"BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is one of my favorite all-time movies.  Beside the fact that Black Rock's buildings were all facades as interior filming was done in an L.A. studio soundstage.  The opening and closing scenes have always made me wonder why the train arrives with Spencer Tracy and then departs with him going in the same direction.  There is no ""Eastbound"" train approaching Black Rock opposite the ""Westbound"" on which he arrived.  Also, the on-rushing train as seen on its approach to Black Rock has a coach immediately behind the ""B"" unit diesel locomotive, but when it arrives in Black Rock, the coach has been replaced by a diner (as witnessed by the stacks on the front-end roof of the car.)  This suggests two different trains were used in filming the same segment.  I do think that the opening scene of Spencer's arrival and the closing scene of his departure from Black Rock were filmed at the same time with the one train.
  I read where the train in the opening was ""run backward"" with the helicopter flying over it (which makes no sense) but I would like to know why there was a train with a diner as the first car and then the train appears with a coach in place of the diner.  Even the book ""The 100 Greatest Train Movies"" did not explain these things about Bad Day at Black Rock.

785717,4,6304111347,"The 1955 film ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" plays like a Sergio Leone spaghetti western. For anyone who has seen Leone's operatic 1960's films that made Clint Eastwood a star (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-with-No-Name-Trilogy-A-Fistful-of-Dollars-For-a-Few-Dollars-More-The-Good-The-Bad-and-the-Ugly-Blu-ray/dp/B003EYEF2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars / For a Few Dollars More / The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) [Blu-ray</a>]), you usually had the Man With No Name arriving in some desolate locale only to be surrounded by a gang of toughs. That's essentially what happens to Spencer Tracy's character John Macreedy. This is not a western, but it does take place in the dying town of Black Rock somewhere near the Mojave Desert. There are no horses in ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" only jeeps and station wagons caked white with dust in post-World War II America.

The train stops in Black Rock for the first time in four years and Tracy's Macreedy steps off the platform much to the shock of the town's meager residents. He strolls the sandy street to the only hotel to book a room. Due to a war injury, Macreedy's handicapped with the use of only one arm. Black Rock's residents, apparently made up entirely of weathered men adorned in faded denim, scatter like insects. The town, as ugly as a junkyard, has a secret, and Macreedy's asking questions about a missing resident that could get him killed.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is the cast, and they play off each other with a skill earned through decades. These are all-time greats performing in a desperate morality play. We should all know Tracy, and he does not disappoint. I'm of the belief he was too old for this role, and yet that very aspect makes him vulnerable. Robert Ryan is local rancher Reno Smith, a semi-leader of the town who tries to keep residents calm. Walter Brennan is Doc, Lee Marvin the menacing tough, Ernest Borgnine the bully, Dean Jagger the alcoholic sheriff and Anne Baxter the uneasy dame. With barely a main street, there's little room in Black Rock, and these varied giants ricochet off each other like bumper cars at a carnival.

Director John Sturges, whose big-budget classics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Seven/dp/B0011XF81G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Seven</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/B000IZZS5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>&nbsp;will be known for as long as we remember movies, guided this stark work with an eye for detail.

""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is a bold precursor to the action-oriented films of the 1970s and 1980s (not to mention Leone's works), with a moody cynicism unique for the Eisenhower era. Sturges' Black Rock also has a lot in common with Hadleyville, the terrified town in need of a savior in the 1952 all-time classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Noon/dp/B000LPH18I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Noon</a>.

There are three breathtaking scenes worthy of study. Early on, Black Rock's residents stand in a tense circle on the railroad track as they discuss what the heck Macreedy is doing in town. Framed by the distant Sierra Nevada mountains, these hard men form a plan in an incredible snapshot. Perhaps the film's best scene is the first meeting of Ryan's Reno and Macreedy at a timeworn gas station. Sizing each other up, their conversation is a brilliant moment of acting, with Tracy reacting with subtle irritation when discussing his war injury.

The most famous scene, a moment my father recalls to this day, is when Reno's henchman Coley (Borgnine) tries to muscle Macreedy. This is where Tracy's age works. He's graying, weathered and handicapped, trying to enjoy a bowl of chili at the saloon. While residents look on, Macreedy is forced to stand up to the towering bully. With sudden fury, he delivers a quick judo chop to the man's neck. A few kicks and chops later, Coley is lying in a bruised heap. Brennan's Doc walks up in astonishment to reply, ""Man oh man!"" Eastwood or Charles Bronson never had a scene that played so well.

I love films from this era, gargantuan Technicolor works painted on canvases with bold musical scores.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/East-of-Eden/dp/B000GOZ54Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">East of Eden</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-the-West-Was-Won/dp/B002ZOBDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How the West Was Won</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Searchers-HD/dp/B0091WUZJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Searchers [HD</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friendly-Persuasion/dp/B005N1UWFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friendly Persuasion</a>&nbsp;-- these mythic entertainments are examples of Hollywood's most inspiring visions. ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is reminder of this storied age never to be matched again.

As much as I hate to say it, the concluding showdown is not very good. Marvin -- on the verge of stardom, and check out his unique mannerisms throughout -- is subdued in an unconvincing action. Macreedy is eventually trapped on a lonely road and improvises a weapon as implausible as a Hardy Boys' booby trap. While Sturges intentionally had Macreedy battle the town without a gun, and one-armed to boot, he could have at least reworked the showdown to be more believable.

Still, the film is a magnificent example of atmosphere and mood, with larger-than-life actors performing on an alien landscape of claustrophobic dust. It's a world unaltered by time. Fifty-plus years and counting since Tracy stepped off that train, ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" plays in our memory, inspiring ghosts on a stage immortal.",1362614400,,6521,6.237777777777778
785718,5,6304111347,"This is, undoubtedly, one of the fastest movies, at 81 minutes, that you will watch. The drama and action are quick paced, with a one-armed John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) squaring off against murderer Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) and his two henchmen Hector (Lee Marvin) and Coley (Ernest Borgnine) in the wide spot in the road known as Black Rock.  Macreedy has plenty of, in the words of Hector, ""iron in his blood"", as he searches for Japanese farmer Komoko, who is the father of the soldier who died trying to save Macreedy's life in Italy during World War II, at his home at Adobe Flat, only to learn that he is dead as well. You know after Macreedy has run-ins with Hector and Pete (John Ericson) the hotel clerk, as well as several lengthy discussions with Smith, that he smells a rat. To cover up the murder of Komoko, Smith resorts to raw intimidation. The scene at the railroad crossing is one of the best parts of the movie, as the conspirators lay down their plans for Macreedy. Robert Ryan delivers some of the fastest and most sarcastic lines you will ever hear, as he gives his thugs their marching orders. Also, his reading of the riot act to Tim Horn the Sheriff (Dean Jagger) is searing. He is never at a loss of stinging comments in this movie. After Coley tries to run Macreedy off the road in the desert, the next step is physical violence. Coley attempts to pick a fight with Macreedy in the town diner, only to receive a one minute clinic in martial arts from the one-armed Macreedy. The final showdown at night in the desert is a dramatic scene, with the resourceful Macreedy more than a match for the rifle-firing Smith. Some of the most beautiful scenery of the California desert and mountains is on display throughout the entire movie, and the menacing Southern Pacific streamlined passenger train that delivers Macreedy to Black Rock seems as if it is ready to come through your television.

From there, the tension builds and builds, thanks to John Sturges's taut direction, a menacing supporting cast, and a town conspiracy of which disturbing details we aren't made privy to until the third act. Heck, we're kept in the dark even with regards to the stranger's motivations.

""Y'know, there's one thing about Black Rock - uh, everybody is so polite. That makes for a very gracious living."" We can take it to the bank that Spencer Tracy's beleaguered protagonist was applying a generous dose of sarcasm when he said that. Spencer Tracy harbored trepidations about whether he'd be able to pull off the action hero part since he was 54 years old at the time and not exactly in the most robust of health. But the draw of playing an essentially one-armed man proved too strong to resist. I think he pulls it off. BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is a gripping hybrid of the western and suspense drama. It would earn Spencer Tracy one of his nine Oscar nominations. Ironically, he would lose out to his co-star, Ernest Borgnine, who would win it for MARTY, a role for which Tracy encouraged Borgnine to audition. What's that they say? No good deed...

So don't gasp when I say that Spencer Tracy is very good here. Regarded as one of Hollywood's all-time greatest actors, Tracy's age actually works in the film's favor. It's exactly this playing against expectations that makes the moment more startling and powerful, when his laconic, one-armed character drops the polite, accomodating act and finally stands up to the malevolent locals. That diner scene - in which the stranger takes on the bullying Ernest Borgnine - is my favorite moment in the film. ""Take my Oscar, will you!"" growls Tracy as he viciously karate chops Borgnine in the throat... (Or maybe that didn't happen.) Tracy is supported by a fine cast of character actors, although, okay, Lee Marvin is more of a leading actor. Robert Ryan has always excelled at playing those nuanced villains who are composed on the surface but deeply unhinged beneath. Lee Marvin exudes dead-eyed menace as one of Ryan's henchmen. Ernest Borgnine makes the most out of a role that begs him to be mean-spirited and prone to impulsive acts of violence. Tracy's stranger also contends with Dean Jagger's spineless town sheriff and the scheming, innocent-looking Anne Francis. But at least he's got the guilt-ridden Walter Brennan on his side. Or does he?

To paraphrase someone, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is an action film for people who detest action films. It presents an intelligent script. A palpable aura of menace infuses the narrative. The acting is superb. And for those constantly on the lookout for elevated themes, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK offers an understated yet unflinching observation on a heinous wrong committed by the U.S. government during World War II. But if you're not in the mood for what then was a socially relevant hot button topic, then just sit back and enjoy BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK for the low-key but ultimately rewarding thriller that it is.",1347321600,3,3535,4.810855263157895

785818,5,6304111347,"If you've never seen Bad Day At Black Rock, you may assume someone named Bad Bart is prominently featured in the story, along with a shootout at high noon. You'd be wrong on both counts. You'd also be wrong if you assumed it was an old-fashioned Western. It's more of a new-fashioned Western, set in a desert town that's a dent by the side of the road, at the end of WWII. That great war may seem like a simple background detail at the beginning of the movie. It's anything but.

Bad Day At Black Rock is a hard-boiled mystery/action/thriller starring Spencer Tracy as Macreedy, a one-armed war veteran who has come out West to fulfill the dying request of a fallen comrade. His destination is a small town that is barely more than a train stop, so you would think the folks who live there would be happy to see visitors. But they have a big secret weighing them down, and they can tell this particular visitor is going to get right to the heart of that secret.

Every time I see this movie, I try to figure out where it was filmed. Some of the rock formations look like Southern Arizona. It could actually be one of several Southwestern locations, a desert with vast, empty space between each town. Space may represent freedom in some circumstances, but in this case it's more of a prison for Macreedy, who can't survive that huge stretch of arid desert if he isn't in a train or in a car with plenty of gas. Since he's arrived on the train, and it won't be back for a few days, he's got to survive until it does - and that turns out to be a huge challenge.

The Bad Guys know Macreedy is a threat to their secret from the moment he gets off the train, yet they underestimate him - and the audience may feel the same way, at first. Macreedy lost an arm in the war, and he's one guy against many. He has courage and integrity, and he's smart, too - possibly too smart for his own good. He asks few questions, but those questions are too perceptive. He sees the trap closing around him, but he doesn't knuckle under. Instead, he keeps thinking. He reacts calmly to the bluster of bullies and never shows them the fear they'd really like to see. This keeps them guessing long enough to buy him a little time. But will it be enough?

You may think you know how things are going to turn out, but Macreedy has at least one trick up his sleeve that will have you cheering. He is a hero, someone who learned to fight in the war. If this movie had been made after 1970, it probably would have been spoiled by having Macreedy beat all the bad guys up with kung-fu expertise. Hollywood has really lost its ability to depict heroes realistically. True heroism is when you're facing down unfair odds and getting your head handed to you on a platter, yet you still try to do the right thing.

The score was composed by Andre Previn, who ""deals in the realm of creating tension and release in his sonic dramas,"" according to reviewer Lindsay Planer on Allmusic.com.

The casting of Bad Day At Black Rock is a who's who of great character actors. Ernest Borgnine is a perfect bully. Robert Ryan is chilling as the Boss behind the scenes, the guy who has always run the show in that unhappy little corner of the world. Anne Francis is best known for her role in Forbidden Planet, but she shows a much broader range here as a woman trapped between a rock and a hard place. Dean Jagger is a ruined marshal who regrets trading his soul for the bottle. And no one could play Macreedy better than Spencer Tracy. He's another actor from the Golden Age of Hollywood, when they were willing to cast leading men who didn't have perfect faces and bodies. It's the force of his personality that makes him stand out from the crowd.

As we get further into the 21st century, those of us who grew up in the shadow of WWII are starting to die off. Many young viewers may miss the point of Bad Day At Black Rock - that a Japanese-American soldier wants his father to have the purple heart he earned fighting for his country. The internment camps are still discussed in history class, but if you don't know someone who went through that, if you didn't go through it yourself, it's hard to understand why someone got killed because of what was going on back home - or why the killers would kill again to keep the secret. This movie is a window into those times. Look through it, and maybe you'll understand why Bad Day At Black Rock is on my Best Movies list.",1341273600,,4425,4.336956521739131
785819,5,6304111347,This movie isn't quite on a par with Inherit the Wind -- one of the finest movies ever made -- but it does have the legendary Spencer Tracy giving another outstanding performance. This time Tracy plays a one-armed war veteran trying to deliver a military award to someone in a town which is hiding a guilty secret. The relentless persistence of Tracy's character in attempting to carry out his mission incurs such opposition that he is persistently threatened and nearly killed. No Spencer Tracy fan -- or fan of outstanding movies -- should miss this superb thriller.,1331942400,,568,4.865979381443299
785820,5,6304111347,"Spencer Tracy's performance is bombproof in this tale of bigotry and hatred. It is a universal story that will stand the test of time by illustrating how xenophobic behavior is allowed to fester in small towns, (and in small nations). It is admirable that it was made in 1955, only a decade after WWII had ended.

If you're a movie fan, it is hard not to be in awe of the tension that is created in this story. The determination of John J. MacReedy (Spencer Tracy) is remarkable as he persistently probes the town's inhabitants to find out what happened and then tries to save himself when he realizes what probably did happen. The brief fight scene with Borgnine in the 'restaurant' is realistic and highly satisfying.

Tracy was nominated for Best Actor for 'Black Rock' and was up against James Dean, but ironically lost to Ernest Borgnine for his role in 'Marty.'",1331942400,,867,4.660130718954249

785822,3,6304111347,"Spencer Tracy. Melodrama. Social problems. Guess Who's Coming To
Dinner. Inherit The Wind. Judgment At Nuremberg. And Bad Day At Black
Rock. No one portrayed morality, ethics, and decency like Spencer
Tracy. And in those other films, his character was believable. The
problem with Bad Day At Black Rock is that it simply is a film that has
no clue what it's about, and its hero, John J. Macreedy (Tracy)- a
one-armed World War Two vet, is simply too good and powerful, almost to
the point of being superhuman. The short (81 minutes) 1955 film, shot
in Cinemascope color is a hybrid of the Western modernized, the film
noir Westernized, the urban social problem film desertized, the
melodrama bowdlerized, the exploitative B film given an A cast, and the
psychodrama simplified.

Although well acted, and pretty well directed by journeyman director
John Sturges (in terms of the framing of shots, and the disdaining of
closeups) and cinematographer William C. Mellor, there is a stiffness
and unreality to the film (beyond its unconvincing day for night
scenes), and it all starts with the creaky screenplay by Don McGuire,
from a story by Howard Breslin. Too often the characters descend into
caricatures. In fact, aside from a few scenes between Macreedy and
Smith, the rest of the town is all caricatures. And matters are not
helped in the least by a terribly telegraphic score from Andre Previn.
The film is melodramatic enough without the constant handholding of the
over the top music telling a viewer that 'here comes the bad guy,' or
'this is the start of something bad.'

Overall, Bad Day At Black Rock is a solid film, but one that has not
dated well. It plays out more like an episode from the original The
Twilight Zone television series, with its moral stamped on every frame
of film. And, without the granite like presence of Tracy in the lead
role, the film could have taken quite a sour turn downward, in terms of
quality. That not being the case, though, it is worth a viewing. Just
do not try to take it as a serious, modern drama, but an allegory of a
faded time, even as that is what the film tries to do with the Old
West. Sometimes recapitulation has its charms. Sometimes not. This film
is the latter. Fortunately, the film's brevity, the presence of Tracy,
to keep the film's narrative from veering off course, and that of the
beautiful Anne Francis, to distract the (male) viewer from the utter
silliness of her, and the lesser characters in the film, is enough to
make Bad Day At Black Rock more enjoyable than it is tedious. Small
praise, but better than none.",1326326400,3,2586,4.706401766004415
785823,5,6304111347,"There is a story that the head of the studio that made this film wanted to pull the plug on it because he thought it subversive.

He was right. It subverts a number of genres: it is a western without any horses; a war story thousands of miles from the front line; a thriller like a ghost story; a film noir set in the desert. But most subversive of all, at the core of the film it is about the consequences of racism, most specifically anti-Japanese racism, and how that racism is often dressed up as patriotism.

The film takes the form, popular in US and Japanese cinema, of the stranger arriving into town as a catalyst for the unfolding story. Spencer Tracy delivers one of his most iconic performances as the stranger, a brave man, but one who has seen too much violence already not to appreciate that, when faced with insurmountable odds, discretion is the better part of valour. Robert Ryan is brilliantly terrifying as the charming thug who dominates the town. Walter Brennan provides some light relief as the town undertaker and vet in the midst of a spare and nightmarish story.

The film must still be regarded as deeply subversive to those ""heartland"" Americans for whom ignorance and provincialism are regarded as virtues. The outsider played by Tracy asserts a different sort of Americanism, a cosmopolitan, progressive and principled one, and is hated and feared as a result.

For Trivial Pursuit and pub quiz afficianados: the film is said to be the first American film to portray the use of eastern martial arts when Tracy's character comes to a point at which he is driven to fight in self-defense, and displays a surprising propensity for karate, the Japanese martial art.",1325462400,,1691,4.741496598639456

785911,5,6304111347,"BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK.  At first, what is striking about this film is that the actors have continued to be ""household words,"" some fifty years after the movie was released.  These ""household words"" are Spencer Tracy, Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Walter Brennan.

Walter Brennan is renowned for his acting in the TV show, THE REAL McCOYS.  He is also admired for his top 40 recitative, OLD RIVERS.  OLD RIVERS went to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1962.  In the 1948 western, RED RIVER starring John Wayne, Walter Brennan made racial comments about Native Americans, calling them, ""dumb injuns.""  In BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, Mr. Brennan redeems himself, by coming against Jap-baiters, and by playing a pivotal role in bringing a murderer of a Japanese-American man to justice.

What is also striking about BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, is that the first third of the story consists of inquiries among the townsfolk as to the mission of Spencer Tracy.  Spencer Tracy has disembarked from a train--the first person in 10 years to disembark at the the village of Black Rock.  One by one, we meet the various characters in the story, and we encounter their efforts at trying to find out Mr. Tracy's mission and Mr. Tracy's identity.  In this way, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is much like the play, TARTUFFE by Moliere.  In Tartuffe, the first half of the play takes the form of a build-up, where the playgoer (or reader) learns of the qualities of Tartuffe, and where it is not until the half-way point that Tartuffe actually makes an entrance.  But the comparison should not stop here.  The script in BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is a bit stagey, perhaps the script is sometimes too deliberate, or too carefully hewn.  But the slight staginess of the script does not detract much from the story.

It is essential that I not tell any more of the plot, because this particular movie is unusually susceptible to a ""spoiler.""  For this reason, I will not give away any more of the plot.  The play is, in essence, a detective story.  In case you were hoping for a shoot-'em-up-western, then forget it.  BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is a detective story and it is a psycho-drama.  Another good point about the movie is that it was filmed in the photogenic Alabama Hills, just to the east of Mount Whitney.

He gets off a train at Black Rock, a very small town with a terrible secret, and is confronted with a trio of bad men and one bad woman who are determined to keep their evil secret and willing to kill to do so.

The only man willing to help is Walter Brennan, the local doctor, who is also threatened when he tries to help.

We all know hell will break loose and soon. A Bad Day at Black Rock is one of the most tense films ever made because it's dark atmosphere of isolation. In films set during the days of western expansion, it's easy to see how a small town can be controlled by a few men. However in the mid-twenty century when communication across the united states already became common place, it's a frightening  anachronism; Especially when a foreign person enters who dosen't appear very threatening.

John Macreedy is on a simple mission. A Japanese-American solider named Komoko, who saved Macreedy's life and was killed during the then recently concluded secound world war, was awarded a medal. Macreedy plans to take the medal to the soldier's father in Adobe Flats which is near Black Rock. John soon discovers the remains of the father's homestead and his un-marked grave. Black Rock's citizens, who have been hostile since Macreedy had arrived, try their best to drive Macreedy out; This is definetly one of the great trials of a hero in film. The men Macreedy encounter are twice his size and viciously, and at the same time calmly, intimidate him by trying to deny him living quaters and food. Every minute on screen is a ticking clock, you don't know how long it will be until those men use physical violence. Eventually it does errupt into a physical conflict when Macreedy, who only has one arm, diposes of one the thugs. At the same time Macreedy talks to the few residents who are willing to help. He forces them confront to what happened to Komoko's father, how he was murdered by the blind hatred which was exacerbated by the attack on pearl harbor. Once again, a testament to a hero that shreds injustice with logic and boldness. The film is brief at 81 minutes and it's the perfect length for the conlflict to errupt and the casting is ideal; Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Marvin serve as the principle anatgonists.

786009,4,6304111347,"At times it can feel a tad stiff, but overall, John Sturges intense look at racism during WW2 is quite engaging and often unsettling.  Using a dusty backdrop that elicits a feeling of isolation and segregation in itself, `Bad Day at Black Rock' is a film that you feel in your bones.

The small town of Black Rock isn't the most hospitable of towns.  John Macreedy finds that out first hand when he arrives mysteriously and immediately under speculation.  With one hand in his pocket, Macreedy tries to keep peace while searching out a certain Japanese man that no one in the town seems comfortable talking about.  Soon his questioning goes too far and his life is placed on the line as Reno Smith, the unofficial law of the land, begins to ponder how easy it would be to make Macreedy `disappear'.

The films moral breakdown may seem rather tame compared to the issues presented in films today, but the way in which racism is addressed (which was a big step for film in the 50's) is done rather bluntly and powerfully, especially when you consider the fact that just a few years ago people in the states were treating Middle-Easterners just as cruelly as the Japanese are treated in this film (off screen).

It's a poignant message.

The real highlight here is the acting.  Across the board the performances are strong and memorable.  Spencer Tracy is quickly becoming a favorite of mine.  His portrayal of Macreedy is stunning to say the least.  He captures this `calm before the storm' about him without ever once overreaching.  He maintains a believable stillness.  Robert Ryan is Tracy's opposite, and he uses his demeanor to create a perfect villain.  His arrogance and oppressiveness is chilling.  I also really enjoyed what Walter Brennan and Dean Jagger lent to the film, especially Jagger, who managed to give a clich&eacute;d stock character (the manipulated sheriff) a life all his own.

In the end I recommend this film, for it has a poignant message that we do well to entertain in these politically charged times.  The film also shows how a small town can become so burdened by their own secrets that they seek almost any avenue to reach solace, even if that leads to even darker secrets.

Everybody in town looks up as the streamliner comes to a stop in the town of Blackrock. A stranger John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) steps off the train. Will you be here long asks the porter. Only a day is the reply.

Everybody in town is antagonistic and grills Macreedy. We pretty much seen the formula and immediately realize that the town has something to hide. What is it? Moreover, why are they suspicious of the stranger?

The story is not unique but how it plays out his and we are intrigued in watching the interaction between the men as they try to size each other up. There is a lot of soul-searching in this movie. Will Macreedy uncover the town's secret before they uncover his? And if so will he live to tell?

The only character that is really out of place and I suspect was just placed there because of Hollywood's requirements is Liz Wirth (Anne Francis) that is out of place. This was two years before the movie ""Forbidden Planet.""

786013,5,6304111347,"Led by outstanding photography and one of Spencer Tracy's most powerful performances, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is jarringly good for a movie relatively few people outside film class have ever seen or even heard of.  I saw it on TCM for the first time a few years ago.  Not only was I shocked by how good it was, I was surprised it wasn't a cowboy movie set in the ""wild west.""  (I suppose I'm in good company.  When Gene Siskel saw ""Fargo,"" he thought he was going to see a cowboy movie.)  Far from being disappointed, however, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK instantly became one of my all-time favorites.  The story, acting, dialogue, and photography are first-rate.  Visually, it's John Sturges's best work.

It is well to remember that this movie hit the theaters just ten years after WWII.  In 1955 there were virtually no second thoughts in this country about how we had summarily imprisoned loyal Americans of Japanese ancestry simply because of that ancestry.  Fittingly, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK was filmed outside the tiny desert town of Lone Pine, California, just ten miles down the road from Manzanar, one of the Japanese-American ""internment camps.""  Manzanar is now a National Historic Site operated by the US National Park Service.  It isn't easy to get to; and it's gut-wrenching to see the museum exhibits, including the huge photograph of a white woman standing under a storefront sign with the words: ""Japs Keep Moving-This is a White Man's Neighborhood.""  But every American ought to go there.  (By the way, while you're in the area visit the Lone Pine Film History Museum.  Literally hundreds of movies have been filmed in Lone Pine and in the nearby Alabama Hills.  An entire wall of the museum is dedicated to BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK.)

There are maybe forty or fifty DVDs any self-respecting movie fan ought to own.  This is one of them.  Buy it.  (Caveat emptor: The ""film historian"" Dana Polan is an egghead who spends an hour and twenty minutes deconstructing BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK instead of giving us film history.

Their tension turns to hatred and violence as they learn that Macreedy is investigating the town's darkest secret.

This movie is more tense than suspenseful. You can feel the hatred and guilt each time Macreedy walks into a room. As the mystery unravels, the movie's message really comes through, one that may not be timeless, but is still compelling.

786102,3,6304111347,"Directed by the late great John Sturges, Bad Day at Black Rock is a tense action, drama and Western blend. Beautiful cinematography showcases the sweeping desert vistas in California and veteran actor Spencer Tracy demonstrates his top-notch acting talents. A multifaceted tale of revenge, redemption and stirring courage, Bad Day at Black Rock was a good day for cinema.

John Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) arrives by train to the small town of Black Rock, and is immediately met with antipathy. Mysterious, yet straightforward, he is in search of an old acquaintance, a Japanese man named Komoko who lived nearby in Adobe Flat. The town of Black Rock holds a dark secret, however, and leader Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) will stop at nothing to prevent Macreedy from discovering the whereabouts of Komoko and what happened years ago to force the town into hostility and silence toward all outsiders.

Perhaps the most unique aspect of the film is its cinematography. Director John Sturges uses plenty of wide shots that allow the audience to see the grand mountainscapes and the bright blue sky in the background. An expert eye for scenery and framing, the camera is also almost completely devoid of close-ups. We see from the hat to the boot on every character, in nearly every scene, and we definitely feel voyeuristic and as much of an outsider to Black Rock as Tracy must feel receiving the cold shoulder from the townsfolk. These widescreen views make the town even more isolated from the world around it.

The film follows a very Western feel, with a rugged cowboy look complete with dust, sand and deserts. But it is oddly modernized with the use of cars instead of horses, set right after World War II. In a particularly exciting scene, Macreedy is chased through a forlorn and dusty road by the henchman Coley (Ernest Borgnine). Intense and explosive, this is not your standard car chase; it feels like an Old West chase on horseback with mechanical beasts substituting the standard Western animals.

Macreedy is a unique character, magnificently portrayed by Spencer Tracy. Maimed in the war, he keeps one hand in his pocket at all times, giving him a harmless appearance. However, he has a confident, stern gaze, and while he gives in at times to avoid unnecessary battles, he's seemingly unafraid of anything. Though he uses his intelligence to avoid physical fighting, in an unavoidable confrontation, he is surprisingly able to coolly defend himself one-handed with skillful combat expertise. He chooses most often to use his wits over brute force, but he clearly has control over both. Almost single-handedly cleaning up the fearful town, he uses guilt and conscience to persuade the town to do the right thing, despite the stranglehold Reno Smith has over all of them.

Bad Day at Black Rock has plenty of suspense, but at times almost drags out too long. Carefully but perhaps too slowly, it fills the audience in on the town's dark secret. Early on it is fairly obvious as to what has happened - so all the anticipation that is built up overshadows the actual revealing of truths. It's enough for us to witness Macreedy's survival and his brandishing justice.

A noirish Western with suspense and drama, Bad Day at Black Rock is very much a classic, with careful character studies, an exemplary lead protagonist and excellent action. Nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Director, Screenplay and Actor, this is Spencer Tracy at his best.

786104,2,6304111347,"-- Spoilers ahead, but you may thank me for saving you the trouble of watching this movie. --

I saw this movie on the Turner Movie channel on TV last night because I was surprised that there really was such an actual thing as a ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" movie. I had thought it was just an expression to indicate a bad situation in a bad place for many years....

They could have shot this poor, miserable thing in about three days, and edited it for production in about another half-day.  The plot, the acting, the screenplay, the directing, and the cinematography were about on a level of something that a high-school Junior could have done.

The characters were entirely unbelievable, and not even good ""cartoons"" of what their characters were probably supposed to be.  Spencer Tracy just kind of chuffed along, being stoic and unruffled, supposedly a disabled veteran of World War II.  Good grief!  He would have been at least 10 years too old to have even enlisted in the military, let alone actually had a combat role in Italy.  And here he is, one-armed and all, in this bar and grill, beating the living hell out of the Ernest Borgnine character, who is much younger and in full possession of limb and vitality. No, no, a thousand times...no!

The Robert Ryan character...well, and I'll admit, I never cared at all for just about anything Robert Ryan ever did as an actor, was just about as subtle, and believable, as a comet striking the Earth tomorrow afternoon. When he shoots his female ""love interest"" with a rifle toward the end of this awful movie, you just feel like turning the TV off. There's absolutely no reason for it, or anything else that this character does. Anne Francis plays the part of the woman Ryan kills... she probably felt like jumping out a window after being a part of this movie, but a year later played another love-interest role, with Leslie Nielson in ""Forbidden Planet"".

The list of unbelievability goes on and on, throughout the whole cast. Why are any of these people in this horrible little dusty, desolate hamlet anyway? This film could be called ""Film Noir"" of the late 40's through early 50's, except that there's no depth, no complexity, no intrigue, and ultimately, really nothing to it at all!

Ultimately, it's revealed that the ""townspeople"" killed a Japanese guy who bought a piece of land out there in this awful place and found water on it at a depth of sixty feet. This was something that none of the Caucasians had been able to do, so, after Pearl Harbor and everything, they went out to his house one night and set fire to it with him in it.

Spencer Tracy's character finds out all this, and ultimately, after making contact with all the town's disgusting, shallow characters, gets in touch with the law enforcement authorities and justice prevails.

But not before you, the viewer, endure all this run-up to what turns out to be a decidedly undeniable waste of time.

It's a ""statement"" about anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States during World War II, made in the Fifties, and I'm sure that it was, therefore, regarded as very meaningful, thoughtful stuff for a contrite, guilty nation to consider.  But as a movie, if indeed that was the purpose, it didn't even begin to do justice to the subject material, producing only a rather mystifying, boring, almost silly movie instead.

I should have given it one star, except that the opportunity to see Lee Marvin in a movie at such an early age made it interesting for that reason alone. He did a good job of it, too, even though his character, like everyone else's was just unbelievable, by any standard.",1197158400,7,3618,4.674015748031496

Thus far, BAD DAY AT HONDO appears to out of print, but the next best thing is the shooting script which is available online.  A side-by-side comparison of script and film reveals a great many omissions and revisions that make for a kind of open-source experience, and many of the peculiarities in the film are justified in the script.  I believe the longer film would have been significantly better, but the one we have is Plenty-stimulating.
Dore Schary also produced GO FOR BROKE, a 1951 film that tells the very poignant tale of 442nd RCT Japanese-American volunteer GIs in Italy and France, and works as a fine prequel to BLACK ROCK by grounding Macreedy's rationale for coming to a hostile, flyspeck cowtown (where you'll never see a horse) and probing buried animosities until they gush with fresh blood.
The very literate script for BLACK ROCK also brings a satisfying roundness to the dimestore loafers (Marvin and Borgnine), while making Francis necessary and every other speaking role more plausible and real, most especially Macreedy.
It WAS explosively subversive, and it still is, despite the fact that this film that bristles with subtext was meant to contain much more than was shot (or much more that was left on the cutting room floor).

786210,5,6304111347,"""Bad Day at Black Rock"", Spencer Tracy's final film at MGM (he would refuse to do ""Tribute to a Bad Man"", next, and was released), is a fitting climax to 20 years of unforgettable performances. The first MGM Cinemascope production, directed by John Sturges (one of the most gifted directors of the 50s and 60s), with an incredible cast of Oscar winners and future Oscar winners (Want to have some fun? Count the number of Oscars appearing in each scene...I came up with EIGHT, once!), all held together by Tracy, at the peak of his acting skills.

The story is deceptively simple; In the post-war West, a one-armed war vet (Tracy), arrives in a tiny desert town, asking to see a local Japanese farmer...the locals (a collection of aging, careworn townspeople and a ruthless gang of bullies, working for 'boss' Robert Ryan) act strangely, and do everything they can to force Tracy to leave. He gets suspicious, and starts asking questions...and a tragedy of bigotry and murder unfolds, kept secret by the fear of Ryan and his gang.

Ultimately, the story becomes a struggle between Good (crippled Tracy, whose integrity won't let him quit, and whose disability doesn't lessen his power) and Evil (arrogant Ryan, eaten up by racism and bitterness over being rejected for service, and more 'crippled' than Tracy was), and of Redemption (for the townspeople, who allowed Evil to flourish, out of fear and apathy, and now have a chance to make amends and 'do the right thing') set against beautiful, if barren widescreen vistas of a parched, dying desert community.

If this sounds too 'intellectual' for your tastes, enjoy the story as a rip-roaring suspense drama...it works, either way!

Featuring fabulous supporting performances by Walter Brennan (in one of his best roles of the decade), Dean Jagger, Russell Collins, young John Ericson and Anne Francis, and, most especially, frequent co-stars Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin (who were Hollywood's best 'Badmen' of the 50s, yet would each win Oscars playing 'Good Guys'!)

Robert Ryan, who never won an Oscar (but SHOULD have), is riveting, oozing total malevolence behind a genial smile; his gas station scene with Tracy is about as great as movie acting ever gets, with both actors burning up the screen!

786211,5,6304111347,"Bad Day at Black Rock is a quick-paced, tension-filled movie with a great cast that will have you riveted to your seat for its 81-minute running time.  In 1945 in the months following WWII in the small desert town of Black Rock, the Streamliner train stops at the station for the first time in four years.  A one-armed passenger, John J. Macreedy, gets off, looking for a Japanese farmer who lived in the area in 1941.  But the townspeople don't appreciate his presence in town, trying to intimidate him into leaving Black Rock, but can Macreedy figure out what happened to the Japanese farmer before the townspeople close in on him?  For years, I'd heard of this movie, but never saw it.  I'm really glad I finally got around to seeing it because this is a great movie, full of suspense and tension.  The film only used one set, the desert town, which helps set the tone for the sun-baked bleakness of Black Rock as Macreedy tries to find answers about the Japanese farmer for unknown reasons; is he a cop, a private detective?  Find out for yourself and get this movie.

  Like many John Sturges directed movies, Black Rock has an impressive cast, headed by none other than Spencer Tracy. Tracy plays Macreedy as such a relaxed character that you're waiting anxiously for his next line and when he'll finally snap.  Robert Ryan gives a frightening performance as Reno Smith, the local man in charge who has others do his bidding.  Anne Francis plays a small but key part as Liz Wirth, a young woman running the gas station.  Dean Jagger and Walter Brennan are excellent as drunken Sheriff Tim Horn and Doc Velie Jr, two men in town who debate siding with Macreedy as more secrets are revealed.  And while all the cast gives fine performances, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine steal almost all the scenes they're in as Hector David and Coley Trimble, Smith's two henchmen who resort to intimidation and brute force to scare Spencer Tracy.  The DVD contains a beautiful widescreen presentation, a theatrical trailer, and a commentary track from film historian Dana Polan.  The extras aren't much, but the film is worth it on it's own.  So for a movie with a great cast led by Tracy and Ryan with plenty of tension and suspense throughout, check out Bad Day at Black Rock!",1153958400,4,2269,4.646616541353383
786212,4,6304111347,"Spencer Tracy rides into town on the Southern Pacific.  The engine is diesel.  He's carrying a suitcase and wearing a black fedora.  The town is smack in the middle of the Mojave Desert, just a handful of wooden buildings, like the back lot at Paramount during the days when they made a lot of cowboy movies.

This is, and is not, a cowboy movie.  It's the late forties, just after World War II.  Tracy has the left sleeve of his suit coat tucked into the pocket.  He lost an arm somewhere.  He's slow to anger.  He has a mission.  What it is, is mysterious.  In fact part of the effectiveness of this unusual movie is in how mysterious everything is.  Why this godforsaken town?  Why are the people so uptight about his arrival?  Who is he and what does he want?

Robert Ryan plays the villain, the leader of the gang, so to speak.  Lee Marvin plays a tough gunslinger.  Ernest Borgnine plays a bully who gets the tar kicked out of him in a barroom fight--well, the place is like a saloon, only there's a soda fountain/caf counter and no swinging doors.

There's a one-cell jail in which the alcoholic sheriff can be found sleeping it off.  There a telegraph station at the train station where telegrams might or might not be sent.  Walter Brennan co-stars as the obligatory town ""Doc"" a washed-up man ashamed of himself.  So much like an old-style western is this slightly ""noir"" film from 1954 that at some point I actually expected to see Gabby Hayes come running up to gum a line or two.  There's a gal (Anne Francis) looking as neat and cute as Dale Evans in her prime, but she doesn't amount to much.  This is a guy kind of flick, a faux western in which manhood is tested, in which men find out what they're made of, in which the good guys win and the old movieland code is rigorously upheld.

Some of the scenes were probably shot out in Simi Valley where they used to shoot the old Tom Mix and Johnny Mack Brown westerns with large granite boulders adorning dirt trails.  You can almost hear the horses gallop and see the chips fly off the boulders as the bullets sing out.  Instead of horses however there are Ford coupes and a Jeep.  The gunfight scene at night has Robert Ryan rifling down at Tracy using the headlights of his car to see, while Tracy is without firearms, but of course not without resources.

The plot concerns a certain Japanese man who had a homestead farm out among the boulders who ended up missing after his farm was burned to the ground.  Seems that Robert Ryan's character doesn't like the Nipponese and is still fighting the war in his mind.  Somehow even before it is revealed we know how Tracy lost his arm, but we don't exactly know why he's here.  I won't reveal that for those who haven't seen this, but you might guess.  He served in the infantry in Italy.  Robert Ryan for mysterious reasons was not allowed to enlist--he says.

Aside from the nicely developed and held tension and the beautiful score by Andre Previn, the effectiveness of this movie lies in the interesting performances by the talented cast.  One of the first Cinemascope movies, Bad Day at Black Rock (great title!) is also wondrously filmed so that the empty feel of the desert and loneliness of the isolated town surrounded by stark mountains and a high blue sky will stay with you long after you see the old style ""The End"" as the film fades to black for the last time.

The town is unreasonably hostile. It is run by a rich rancher, Robert Ryan. There is a great cast of character actors as the heavies including a young Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine. This movie addresses the subject of racism and of the way the Japanese were treated during and after WWII.

786217,5,6304111347,"Spencer Tracy is the one-armed man who gets off a train one day in Black Rock, a flea-bitten desert town, to deliver a medal of heroism to the Japanese father of the man who saved his life during the war, and died doing it. From the minute he gets off the train everyone in the town - Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Robert Ryan in particular - treats him with suspicion and abhorrence. Obviously they're afraid he will uncover their crime: killing the Japanese man Tracy is looking for just after Pearl Harbor and then covering it up. Eventually Tracy does uncover it.

Tracy is excellent as the subdued John MacReedy caught in a web of hate and fear. The film has the tautness of HIGH NOON - and many other similarities as well: the concise time frame (one day), the doomed man standing alone against adversity, even the western desert setting. The script sizzles, and it's a mighty diatribe against racial prejudice and ignorance. The photography, in color, of the American desert is absolutely stunning.

786280,4,6304111347,"A nattily dressed one-armed man arrives in a small southwestern town and brings to light a dark, dirty secret the townspeople thought they had buried years ago.
  The man is John Macreedy (Spencer Tracy), and what he's doing in Black Rock is slowly - very slowly - revealed.  That presents a challenge for someone trying to write about the movie for someone who hasn't seen it.  If ever a movie should be watched with an empty bucket of information it's BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK.  Suffice it to say that many of the townspeople are less than thrilled to see the man-in-black stranger, and his soon-to-be chief nemesis, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) makes it his business to see that the town's dirty past stays buried, by whatever means possible.
  There's a lot more character interaction than straight out action in BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK.  If Ryan's Reno represents an absolute evil, he's abetted by the corrupt (Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin, in particular), the apathetic (town doc Walter Brennan), and the used-up (town sheriff Dean Jagger.)  Things change, though, and the ground upon which personal relationships are based tends to shift.  Those who could abide the town's evil secret find their position less tenable the longer Macreedy sticks around, and BAD DAY takes great delight in chronicling the changes. As usual, Ryan is just right as the thoughtful bad guy.  It's hard to find a movie Ryan was ever miscast in.  The Macreedy role plays to Tracy's strength - in particular his ability to project moral righteousness without sermonizing.
  Besides a trailer, the dvd carries a commentary track by film historian Dana Polan.  I jotted down three of his comments, more or less at random: ""This movie asks the question `what is the western in the modern age?'"" ""The movie shows that towns are tight knit communities that contain secrets,"" and ""This movie is about fallen characters who are learning how to find redemption.""  Polan's approach isn't among my favorites for a commentary track.  Tying themes and motifs in a particular movie to major trends in films in general is a legitimate way to go about things, but it gets a little wearying after a while. Overall, though, a strong recommendation for this one.",1119052800,18,2219,4.874666666666666
786281,2,6304111347,"I was obviously expecting a lot more from this movie than it supplied. Going by all of the reviews and the Director John Sturges who gave us such greats as The Great Escape, The Magnificent Seven and The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, I was expecting to see a wonderful move that I some how had never heard of.

The movie starts off with a train speeding through a vast desolated area surrounded by mountains. The thought that first came to mind was that this is the middle of no where. As the train continues to move along to what I thought was a good score I began to think this movie looks like it's going to be good. The train begins to slow down and the view of a tiny town comes on the screen. The town is made up of about 7 to 10 buildings. I'm thinking now what the heck is this crummy little town doing out here in the middle of nowhere, it must be a place where they ship livestock.

The train stops and Spencer Tracy gets off. As soon as he gets off he's verbally accosted and grilled as to why he's in town. The train hasn't stopped here in 4 years the man says. Huh! 4 years no train has stopped here. Then why the heck would you even build a town near the RR tracks if you don't use the train. O.K. Maybe they used it earlier for something but not any longer. Tracy then asks how he can get to a place in the area where a Japanese farmer named Komoko lives and the guy goes wild with questions. What are you doing here? What do you want? Why wasn't I told the train was going to stop? Who are you? You should get back on that train and get out of here, comes the warning. Sound ridiculous? Wait it gets worse.

Tracy asks if there's a hotel and is told there is one down the street. As Tracey gets close to the Hotel he's verbally accosted by more locals with similar questions and warnings. Tracy enters the hotel and asks for a room. He's told that there are no rooms available. Was it hard to guess this was going to happen? Absolutely not! Tracy then looks in the registry and sees that the hotel is empty and again requests a room. The answer is still no. It's explained to Tracy that the rooms are for the locals and are rented out by the month and there all rented. Tracy at this point reaches up and grabs a hotel key and says I'll take this one and goes up to his room. Yeah Right! Give me a break. At this point I notice that there are about 12 to 15 rooms in this hotel based on the number of keys on the wall. A 12 room hotel in a town with 7 to 10 buildings that's in the middle of nowhere and the train that hasn't stopped in 4 years. Make sense to you? Not to me. The movie goes down hill fast from here. Tracy is crippled in one arm from the war but is of course a karate expert who whips one of the local tough guys. He eventually suspects and finds out that the town is trying to hide the murder of the man Tracy is looking for. Tracy eventually gets some of the locals to confess because they have a guilty conscience. Yea Right!

I may keep the movie because it was so bad I got a bunch of laughs from it.",1118275200,6,3037,4.014876033057852
786282,5,6304111347,"This is a thrilling suspense film from start to finish.  Though set apparently in post World War II Arizona the film has the feel of a traditional western.  One could draw parallels to another classic western, ""High Noon"", in that the film's protagonist MacCreedy (Spencer Tracy) is confronted with sociopathic bullies and has difficulty enlisting the aid of the few people of good will in Black Rock.  Whereas ""High Noon"" was considered a metaphor for McCarthyism, ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" tackles the theme of racism, in this case the prejudice that was prevalent at the time against Americans of Japanese descent.  John Sturges crafts such an effective tale that you don't feel you are being preached to.  Tracy is solid as the one-armed inquisitor.

786287,5,6304111347,"This is a movie which doesn't ""date"" because it deals with archetypal (representing oft-repeated types) characters and situations which resonate in our consciousnesses for all time. It's not the fight scenes which move me, in fact, the superhero aspects of Tracy's character detract somewhat from the realities of racism, corruption and guilt over which he somewhat magically triumphs.
When I look at this movie today, it speaks to me of the corruption surrounding us in media, politics and business. For the evil, greedy villain, substitute the global corporation. For the sorry townspeople, substitute all of us who put up with today's culture of greed and violence.
It's as if the bad guys are still winning. But everybody knows that the appeal of westerns is that the good guys in the white hats always win. The tension of this movie is almost unbearable because the bad guys look unbeatable.
I agree that the casting is impeccable, but great casting can't fix a bad movie, as ""Gosford Park"" demonstrates.
The greatness of this particular movie is that it presents the eternal struggle for justice as a 20th century classic western beautifully crafted.
I disagree with the reviewer who said tennagers won't understand it. The ones who participate in the ""anti-globalisation"" movement will know exactly what it's about and there are millions of them.

786288,5,6304111347,"There is a lot more to this movie than most people give it credit for.  First and foremost, we have the opening sequence of a train stopping at a very small town [we see no more than a dozen buildings].  Throughout the movie the main character John MacReedy played by Spencer Tracy, is trying to navigate the cold-shouldered xenophobia of an isolated desert town.  If youve ever read Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson, youll know that things are different in small towns, they're much more like families.  So you have this social psychological factor of the members of the small town avoiding their darker past, along with a deeper mob mentality when dealing with MacReedy.  To use a clich, small towns are icebergs, you see less than there is.
Now that there is some basic foundation to the broader issues touched on in the movies structure, we can move on to the storyline.
It is expertly played out in the movie, we are given the small town, MacReedy, and his search for a Japanese man.  We see but don't understand the threatening behavior of the town folk; slowly it dawns on us and we are left with one man against a town and its secret.  I have never encountered a movie quite like this in both execution and style.
It moves quickly, but without the glitz and glam of modern explosion-thons.  There is some action, but it is used expertly, and with purpose.  The acting is superb, with everyone playing their characters believably.
My favorite scene is when MacReedy gets into a fight with a local townsperson played by Ernest Borgnine.  Noting that Tracys character only has one arm, watching him beat the blazes out of Borgnine is entertaining and pleasing.  Borgnine played so many idiotic characters in so many movies, all I could think of as Tracy hit him repeatedly was That was for being the idiot in Blackhole! That was for playing the arrogant fool in The Poseidon Adventure.
All in all, Id recommend this movie to all except teenagers that wouldnt understand it.",1062460800,4,1982,4.699421965317919
786289,1,6304111347,"Got this movie from the library, thinking it would be a good watch, even though I am not a fan of Spencer Tracy. To be blunt, I felt this film was a real let down. It started out fine, there was enough interest and suspense in the opening, but then it went downhill pretty fast. To me, it seemed silly that a town could be like this. That the outside phone lines are cut...so NOONE in town can call out? That noone could have left town, under the pretense of visiting relatives or something, and go to the police somewhere and get it all straightened out? Why didn't the folks who weren't involved with the bad thing just leave town and live somewhere else? I mean,there was absolutely NOTHING at Black Rock to miss if you left!! It was just hokey to me all the way thru. The ""karate"" fight of Spencer and Ernest Borgnine was so silly. Why didn't some of the other men in the room help Borgnine fight him if they really wanted to scare him? And later on, with the jeep scene, it was silly that the man who had the gun just didn't come down from the rocks and shoot Spencer Tracy, who had no gun? But no, first he shoots the only woman we ever saw in the town, and then he hangs out in the rocks, waiting for what, I don't know, but it gives Spencer time to make a fire bomb of sorts out of gasoline and an old bottle, which Spencer just happens to throw perfectly at the bad man with the gun and thus Spencer wins out against the evil men in this town. Sure, the photography was good, the music was a bit out front for my taste ( to me, music should compliment, but not be too obviously heard, as it was here), but the story was just too staged and unreal. It also bugged me that Spencer's ""one arm"" business didn't seem convincing enough to me; it seemed at times you could see an arm in the supposedly empty sleeve.",1046131200,10,1817,4.15014164305949
786361,4,6304111347,"Black Rock. A town out in the middle of nowhere in the California desert. Yet one day, shortly after the end of World War II, an exciting event occurs here. For the first time in four years, the streamliner makes a stop here. Out of it comes one man named Macready (Spencer Tracy), who is also crippled in his left arm. The other townspeople become suspicious when Macready asks to go to Adobe flats to see a Japanese man named Komoko. Macready can't understand why; he's just wants to speak to Komoko about his son, whom Macready served with in Italy. Komoko's son had died defending Macready and, for this, he was awarded a medal that Macready wants to present to Komoko. But something is fishy about this town. It's concealing a secret past, a past that Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) and his henchmen, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) and Hector David (Lee Marvin) want to keep secret.
""Bad Day at Black Rock"" doesn't have too much action. There are a few action scenes, but they are spaced apart. The thing that keeps this movie exciting and suspenseful are the strong, convincing performances. Tracy as the crippled, mysterious and tough loner Macready. Ryan, Borgnine and Marvin are all great as men who want to push Macready over the limit, yet can't seem to faze him. They also run the town, although neither of them is officially sheriff. The real sheriff is a drunken coward played by Dean Jagger. He is also one of the few who befriends Macready. The others include a friendly doctor, T.R Velie, (Walter Brennan) and Liz Wirth (Anne Francis), the sister of Pete Wirth (John Ericson).
The music score, cinematography and direction are also excellent. The score gives the movie another emotional level while the photography gives the desert a foreboding look. And the direction is able to keep up the excitement and the pace.
The only thing I really hate about this movie is a lack of character development. Many of the people are the same way at the end as they were at the beginning. A few have changed somewhat: Jagger's sheriff becomes less of a coward, for one thing. But Ryan, Borgnine and Marvin switch to be bad guys at the drop of a hat when they first spot Macready. Macready, however, is rather different from other such western heroes of the period. For one thing, he is almost impossible to break. He knows that if he strikes first, the others will beat him up and call self-defense. He also doesn't react because he can't do much with one arm (Or so we think).
The movie may serve as a political allegory to the McCarthy Era; Macready was instantly suspected and accused by the townspeople before they could even get to know him. All he had to do was walk into town. The movie also serves as a statement against the racism suffered by Japanese-Americans in World War II. Now some of this is excusable (We shipped them off to internment camps out of paranoia and, contrary to some beliefs, they were not death camps but rather large prisons). But what happened to guys like Komoko is not easy to excuse.
I mentioned that the movie has elements of film noir. Macready has the toughness of someone like Sam Spade or Phil Marlowe, yet is also calm and collected. And often, he is a loner. The people in the town, the males at least, are bad guys the like of those that were dealt with by Spade and Marlowe. And Anne Francis as Liz Wirth is, to some extent, a female fatale. She doesn't turn out to be as friendly to Macready as originally thought. And her fate is similar to those that noir tough girls usually got. Film noir. is also a genre concerned with guilt and crime, two things which are definitely part of this town's history.

786364,5,6304111347,"""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is a riveting suspense thriller with several memorable performances from a first rate cast. Spencer Tracy (in one of his best roles) excels as John J. MacReedy who is in Black Rock to take a medal to the father of one of his wartime colleagues now that the war is over. He encounters unexpected resentment and hostility from some of the residents, in particular from Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin who make a trio of formidable villains. When threats and intimidation have no effect on Tracy (who doggedly continues to pursue his investigations) the three then resort to violence. Also in the impressive cast are Anne Francis, Walter Brennan, Dean Jagger, John Ericson and Russell Collins. With the help of Brennan and Francis and after surmounting many obstacles Tracy eventually gets the upper hand bringing the film to its exciting climax.

Some favourite lines from the film:

Spencer Tracy (to train conductor): ""Oh, I'll only be here for 24 hours"". Train conductor: ""In a place like this that could be a lifetime!"".

Russell Collins (to Spencer Tracy): ""Important? It's the first time the streamliner has stopped here in four years"".

Tracy (to Ernest Borgnine): ""You're not only wrong - you're wrong at the top of your voice!"".

Dean Jagger (to Tracy): ""This ain't no information bureau"".

John Ericson (to Tracy): ""If you're in such a hurry you should have never got off here"". Tracy: ""I'm inclined to agree with you"".

A brilliant and satisfying film expertly directed by John Sturges who later went on to make other classics including ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"", ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"". Sturges was fortunate in having such a remarkably good cast - Borgnine and Marvin in particular were excellent as Robert Ryan's menacing henchmen and Spencer Tracy was at his peak in one of his most powerful and demanding roles ever. He was in fact nominated as Best Actor for his performance in this film but was beaten by Ernest Borgnine for ""Marty"".

In many scenes, one or more of the actors are cut out entirely from the frame which is irritating and distracting. In several moments, we hear Tracy's voice but he is nowhere to be seen on screen because of the limitations of a TV screen format.

7862071,5,6304111347,"Absolutely one of my favourite movies and it's never looked better. Every scene is like a painting someone, somewhere said once, and it's true. The colours, the lighting, the costumes.....just perfect. Spencer Tracy is terrific in it, Robert Ryan is a great bad guy and nice to so so many actors that would become even more famous as time went on and the story remains compelling today. Oddly enough, this is not even available in Canada so I came to Amazon.com to buy it. You deserve to own this too!",1522108800,,501,4.5777777777777775
