8365773,1,B002DQMXMM,"I just purchased this and I am rating the quality of the DVD, not the content of the film! The film is wonderful.

Unfortunately the DVD doesn't look much better than the youtube version. It's grainy and blurry. I'm not sure what happened, possibly it's a transfer from another transfer, or it was filmed on very low quality film to start with. The sound is also low quality. At first I wondered if it was the actual youtube video transferred to DVD and shrinkwrapped, but I don't believe it is. The fact that I wasn't sure isn't a good sign.

The cover and DVD art is of minimal quality. Additionally the DVD appears as ""LOGICAL VOLUME IDENTIFIER"" when put into my computer. It just doesn't look like much time or care was put into producing this product in the first place. It's a shame that we don't have a better copy available when clearly the creators cared a great deal about the film. (Heck, they have David Gilmour playing guitar on it!) Hopefully one day it will be reprinted/restored. Until then I advise folks to just save their money and watch the youtube version for free.",1337817600,2,1086,4.535714285714286
8365774,5,B002DQMXMM,"I have been interested in these fractals for several years.  This video is excellent in covering the scope and potential applications.  It is weak on the generation of these, but that is optainable elsewhere.  Outstanding choice of people to participate in the dvd.",1335052800,,265,5.116279069767442
8365775,1,B002DQMXMM,"Well, I would love to buy this dvd, but it is WAY too expensive.  Is anyone listening out there?",1298073600,,96,4.052631578947368
8365776,5,B002DQMXMM,"I just left a wonderful math class and learned about fractals, the Mandelbrot set etc etc...its all in this video... this is something so simple yet so complex. God is evident in every one He has created and in every thing we see. Every person must view this video!",1268352000,6,265,4.428571428571429
8365777,4,B002DQMXMM,"While a bit of a ""trip"" with the graphics and music from Pink Floyd, the video is a good layman's explanation of how fractals are part of our existence.  One gets the feeling that fractals are as important as time, space and E=Mc2 and are all interrelated and unified.  I first saw this on PBS several years ago and have been wanting to add it to my collection of ""Connections"" and ""COSMOS"".  I suppose time will tell if the video's claims of mathematical purity are true.",1231200000,3,472,4.465116279069767
