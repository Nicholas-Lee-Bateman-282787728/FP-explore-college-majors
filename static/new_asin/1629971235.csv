201825,5,1629971235,"As a proud employee at The Great Courses, I'm excited to see our courses available on Amazon.  The Nature of Matter is an excellent course, and lifelong learners will enjoy the depth and clarity of Prof. Ball's lectures.",1455667200,,220,4.7894736842105265
201826,2,1629971235,Very elementary. Probably suitable for jr. high students; maybe.,1474588800,,64,6.222222222222222

201829,5,1629971235,"This DVD set introduces a lot of topics within chemistry and physics. The format is somewhere between every college lecture you've ever attended, and a Neil DeGrasse Tyson special, so in other words, not bad, but not super visual. I didn't mind the format. The lecturer was good, and presented ideas clearly and made them accessible to basically anyone.

On the whole, I found this didn't go into as much depth as I'm used to, but I have a Master's degree in engineering, so my bias comes into play there. I think this course would be great for high school students who are interested in science, and I would most definitely recommend it to homeschoolers.

Factually, I found the information to be accurate, current, and in line with relevant topics of today. This could be fun for the whole family to watch together, and give parents a good way to introduce certain concepts to their kids, or expand on lessons they're learning in school already. In all, I'm glad I got this. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.",1466812800,,1046,4.648648648648648
201830,5,1629971235,"This is a highly detailed instructional course anyone can take and follow the subject matter. I had considered The Great Courses because of their excellent reputation of delivering subject matter by experts in the field. With two college students in the family and a middle schooler we enjoyed the presentations and the wonderful manual that accompanied the DVDs.
This is explained clearly and thoroughly. It would make a wonderful gift for teens or college age students, along with others seeking to improve their grasp of scientific knowledge. I wish the college classes I took in the 80s and now more recently were taught in this easy to understand fashion.
I received this course at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased evaluation and honest review.",1466640000,,763,5.063492063492063
201831,5,1629971235,"As a homeschooling family, our curriculum is often made up of different textbooks. And sometimes we just need that extra study course, such as this one here. The Great Courses is an amazing company that has put out many terrific dvd sets with the corresponding books. This set here is The Nature of Matter: Understanding the Physical World. It comes with four discs and the accompanying book.

The speaker is Professor David Ball and he is a very good lecturer. Keep in mind, I am not saying this is for younger children at all and probably not even for many teenagers. But our 15 and 19 year old found them to be interesting and kept their attention for the span of the class. I even sat in on a class to see how it was run.

Overall I would urge anyone who homeschools to pick any of their courses up. If they are like this one, it will be a great addition to your curriculum, or for the young person who wants to keep learning. Also good if you have a subject that is harder to learn. This speaker brings things down to the everyday level. Good filming as well. Half the time I can't stand when the filming looks like it is from the 90's. Excellent series!!

*Disclosure* I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All thoughts are 100% mine.",1466640000,,1279,4.3655462184873945
201832,5,1629971235,"I am going to be teaching physical science to 8th graders next year which I haven't done in 14 years.  I didn't have enough time to master the topic since it was only for 1 year in high school so when I saw this video lecture series, I thought it may be a great way to re-visit topics and be able to take notes as needed. I was very worried about it being a boring series where someone just sits in front of the class/room and just talks, but this is not that!  It's really great and clear! Great examples given that are easy for even a non-science person to understand. If you have any interest in the topic of trying to understand basics of chemistry, this would be fantastic. Professor David W. Ball speaks clear and at a good pace to take notes. His examples are easy to relate to and connect ideas very clearly.  There is also a book that came with the series that is written as a transcript of exactly what is said in the video, but doesn't not have all the images. I am actually using it to notate anything extra or interesting that I will pass on in my classroom next year. I will also be able to show clips that give examples.  I am very impressed by this lecture series and am happy I gave it a try.  While I received this Physical world lecture series at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, I choose what I want to review that is useful for me and my family.  This is a product that I will be using thoroughly.",1466380800,,1431,4.148014440433213
201833,5,1629971235,"I was never good in physics in school. Until I finally reached a certain maturity and than school was almost over.......

But it always did interest me and and I wanted to get into it again. So when the opportunity came up to review this item with a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I jumped right on it.

It includes a booklet and 4 DVD's with 24 30 minutes sessions. I haven't even really started yet and I am really into it. It is very well explained and easy to understand. The courses get more complex. But easy explained step by step. Even for Physic Dummies.

7800612,2,1629971235,"Poor continuity, created unnecessary gaps by failing to remind audience of key definitions prior to emphasized points.

7800614,3,1629971235,"This is okay. It's not what I expected, though, nor is it really what I was looking for. Based on the reviews I had read before buying, I thought this was going to be a better fit for my middle school age kids. The information is good, but the presentation style and the discussion seems to be geared toward kids older than mine. Yes, I know the intended audience isn't children, but several of the reviews suggest that this is best suited for middle school ages, so I thought it was what I was looking for. It wasn't. I regret having spent the money on it, but I'm hoping that now that we own it we can come back to it in a few years when my kids are older and can get more out of it.",1514332800,,685,4.007299270072993

7800617,5,1629971235,"Fantastic course. As a retired college and high school teacher, I can see this as a perfect addition to a science class curriculum. The subjects are always presented after clear titling, organized extremely well, and ""bite-sized""...just enough information to be interesting and learn without overwhelming a learner. The course background, graphics, and set lighting are all pleasing. Professor Ball's vocal tone, pacing, and emphasis were all quite professional making it easier to follow difficult points with ease.

One negative: Constant fidgety camera work, forcing the poor instructor to pace like a wounded animal back and forth while the camera zoomed in and out, broke my concentration during several episodes.",1492300800,,718,5.587155963302752

Great for those of us who have been out of school for many dozens of years, but still have an interest in remembering this stuff.  Besides, things are much more advanced now.  Clear and interesting.  I don't know about the other parts of this series, that can be had for 7.99 a month.  I really don't have much interest in anything except the science part.
