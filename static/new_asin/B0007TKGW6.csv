2240637,5,B0007TKGW6,"Well, what do you expect me to say???  The WB's and guests are up to their old tricks, traveling the world, sampling it's wares, (on and off screen), and having the time of their lives!!!  An excellent career if you can get it, well, except for the vomiting.  Hey, supermodels do it too, just aren't as up front about it.  Would they be fun to party with... mmm",1169596800,,361,4.264705882352941
2240638,5,B0007TKGW6,If you liked Season One youll love season two same amount 8 episodes like the first season but this season includes guest stars such as Johnny and Wee-Man in a few of the episodes there a few of bonus deleted scenes that are helarious and disgusting at the same time if you liked season 1 get this season and you won't be disapointed besides it is really cheap,1143590400,,360,4.3088235294117645
2240639,5,B0007TKGW6,"If there was only ONE stunt on this DVD, the purchase price of $20 would still be worth it! This DVD set is so hilarious and it goes on for over 5 hours with lots of unseen footage. There is a lot of uncensored material not seen on the broadcast version. The only way they could make this show better is if they included a wildlife conservation message or at least a few more facts about the animals.

Some of the best scenes on this DVD are the scenes in Indonesia. There is some really amazing footage on these discs! Two of the best stunts to look for are ""Glove of Ants"" and ""Coconut Crabs""... These are hilarious and beautifully shot!",1139011200,,639,4.2809917355371905
2240640,4,B0007TKGW6,"If you've seen the first season, the second season is way better! My favourite is the outtakes and the deleted scenes. Very funny stuff!",1128902400,,136,4.708333333333333
2240641,5,B0007TKGW6,vomit + wild animals + steve-o + chris pontius= funny funny movie or tv show.i would recommend watching the show on mtv2 a little before you but though just to make sure you have the stomache for it.,1118534400,2,199,4.2631578947368425
2240642,5,B0007TKGW6,"Tired of the over-earnestness of The Crocodile Hunter and Jeff Corwin? Those crazy Wildboyz are back for a second season filled with more snake bites and animal poop jokes than you can shake a stick at. This season is a mix of countries they visited last time around with some new places too. They haven't messed around with the formula at all (if ain't broke, why fix it, right?) as Chris Pontius and Steve-O mix it up with various dangerous animals and insects while also performing all kinds of gross out stunts that usually involve both of them puking their guts out at some point.

The Florida episode is, without a doubt, the most entertaining one as the boys hook up with animal expert Manny Puig, venomous snake expert David Weathers and ""movie star"" Johnny Knoxville who is his typical smart-ass self. The highlight of this episode occurs when Knoxville pulls a practical joke on Steve-O, fooling him into believing that he's been mortally wounded by a lethal snake. As Knoxville is being ""rushed"" to the hospital, he tells Steve-O that it was all a joke.

What makes the Wildboyz work so well is that they don't take themselves too seriously. The relationship between the whiney Steve-O and the happy-go-lucky Chris works well and their dynamic is only improved when they include someone like Manny or Knoxville into the mix. This season certainly won't convert fans who didn't like the first one but those who love watching these goofy guys take the piss out of animal shows like The Crocodile Hunter will find a lot to enjoy with these episodes.

Disc one features an audio commentary on every episode by Chris, Steve-O and co-creators/producers Jeff Tremaine and Dimitry Elyashkevich. Wee-Man joins them on his episode (Kenya) and Knoxville joins them on his two (Florida and Indonesia) - not surprisingly, these are the best commentaries of the bunch. They are often chaotic affairs as everyone proceeds to make fun of Steve-O and crack jokes at what we are watching.

Disc two starts off with deleted footage from each episode that totals 40 minutes! It's really a shame some of this footage was cut, for example, in Australia Chris and Steve-O have salt water crocodiles swim between their legs and then they dive in their tank!

There is also a 20-minute collection of outtakes and bloopers that include, most interestingly, fall-out from certain segments, like just how painful the ant glove incident was for Chris and Steve-O.

""Wildboyz Unclothed,"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the Costa Rica episode that shows how certain segments, like Steve-O's bungee jump, came together.

""Wildboyz Encyclopedia"" is the ""educational"" extra that takes a look at a particular animal from one of the episodes and allows you to view a clip from said segment showing the animal in action.

There is also a trivia game which tests your knowledge of Season 2 and rewards all the right answers with a previously unseen clip that maybe should have been left unseen.

""Bite List"" gives a run down of how many animal bites Chris and Steve-O have received over the season, where on their body and in which country.

Finally, there is a photo gallery of most of the episodes with captions for each picture which is a nice idea.",1114473600,28,3225,4.847272727272728
2240643,5,B0007TKGW6,"The second season of MTV's wildboyz is just positively marvalous in all ways possible, I mean everything about these 2 DVD's are just jolly good!

2240651,5,B0007TKGW6,"Although you won't become an animal expert from watching these videos, you might pee yourself from laughter.  Their willingness to try anything is proven time after time in each place they visit.  They are at their best whenever the locals feed them alcohol and the scene of them in Indonesia made the DVD worth the money in itself.  No regrets.  Everyone who has watched it has wanted a copy.",1223856000,,393,4.6521739130434785
2240652,5,B0007TKGW6,"I love this show. It is truly a nature program, of course its a nature program with Steve-O and Party Boy (Chris Pontius)!

Wildboyz isn't stupid stunts, its stupids in the wild. I've learned alot by watching this show and I've seen places and things on Wildboyz, that I have never seen anywhere else! The show also features Manny Puig and he is a legend!

If you love nature, the wild and a whole lot of funny to go along with it, its time for the Wildboyz!",1211068800,,458,4.252873563218391
