8696130,1,B00RWKN9T0,"Terrible, junky - DON'T buy it - I returned it immediately, it's as bad as other reviews said - I was hoping that was not the case since this was a gift for my friend who is a huge Kid Rock fan but it is just as bad.  I'd like to give it zero stars but not possible.  I have no clue how Amazon could even sell this piece of junk, embarrassing to their name.",1482796800,,357,3.7466666666666666

8696132,1,B00RWKN9T0,"This dvd comes out every couple of years under a different name. Once it was called the devil knows my name, I can remember the other ones but this is an old did with a new jacket. Unauthorized biography and kid is not in it at all. Just some hicks that wish they were friends  with him now, who Bob probably hated back in the day. Don't waste your money. If I could give it zero stars I would.",1433462400,4,394,3.9873417721518987
8696133,1,B00RWKN9T0,"I'm embarrassed that this is even in my possession. We've had it for 2 months and finally opened it last night to watch it. I'm a huge fan of Kid Rock, and anyone that thought this was a good idea, investors included, you should find another hobby. This is trash and disrespectful'",1432512000,,281,4.423076923076923

8696135,1,B00RWKN9T0,The absolute worst DVD I have ever purchased.  Very low quality. Looks like it was made in someone's basement in the 80's. It is not honored by Kid Rock. No Music or interviews by Kid Rock at all. Has some borderline smut porn in it. Bottom line is don't waste your money like I did.,1429315200,9,283,4.1454545454545455

8696137,1,B00RWKN9T0,Do not buy! It's not authorized by Kid Rock and it's horrible. I feel dumber having watched the first couple minutes. Not to mention it is sprinkled with ridiculous scenes of women dancing with no context. So stupid. What a waste of money,1428710400,6,238,4.558139534883721
8696138,1,B00RWKN9T0,This is the worst dvd ever. DO NOT BUY. I want my money back too.  This is not even authorized by kid rock says so in tiny words on back of the box. Total ripoff. ZERO STARS,1428537600,6,173,3.675675675675676
