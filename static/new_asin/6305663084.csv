The movie like most older comedies doesn't really play funny anymore, if it ever did.

That being said it is an interesting time capsule of a largely forgotten Nixon spoof comedy. This curiosity purchase will hold your interest but don't expect to be wowed.

I've bought two separate, brand-new copies of this -- the extras refuse to play in both cases, and the movie itself locks up right around the 30-minute mark. Truly abysmal DVD authoring. Buyer beware!",1223337600,3,292,4.634615384615385
