7807004,5,630024847X,"I purchased this videotape because my husband is in a stage production of Fawlty Towers, episodes Basil the Rat and Communication Problems. Since rehearsals were not scheduled to begin until April, he suggested finding these episodes to get a head start on his lines and some idea of how to portray his character, ""the Major"". Searches for these episodes on line through the usual media outlets proved difficult to impossible. With this VHS tape, my husband can review his lines, rehearse cues and timing, and get a general feel for the part. Fortunately we have a VHS player to do this. (With headphones so he can replay the parts he needs without any ""Major"" complaints from me!)",1458086400,,681,4.829059829059829

7807006,5,630024847X,"John Cleese once remarked that he did as much with ""Fawlty Towers"" in 12 episodes than Lucille Ball did in several years of ""I Love Lucy"". When I first heard that, I thought Cleese was being as crass as Basil Fawlty. But you know something? He came darn close.
Volume 4 of the ""Fawlty Towers"" series is as marvelously manic and hysterical as the other three. ""Communication Problems:, ""The Anniversary"", and ""Basil the Rat"" are typical examples of the genius that John Cleese & Co. output in the all-too-brief lifespan of this series. Pick up the complete set!",1087862400,2,560,4.724489795918367
7807007,5,630024847X,"This tape contains the three episodes Communication Problems, The Anniversary, and Basil The Rat.
All three episodes are among the best  in the two Fawlty Towers series! The interesting thing is that Basil  Fawlty shows a softer (however in no way sentimental) side of himself,  especially in the first two episodes. This does not make him less funny, in  contrary, it gives his character something extra.
Really great. If you  only want one Fawlty Towers tape, this is the one!",967248000,3,478,4.925

7807009,5,630024847X,"Manwel keeps a Hamster for a pet, Basil thinks it's a Rat andso orders his Spanish waitor to get rid of it. After all, a Rat-Hamster creature is not the type of thing you want to havw around when there is a health inspector about. As guests arrive Basil is suspicious of all, knowing that some could be health inspectors. So he is polite, serving on them hand and foot, until he finds out that they're not the health inspector at all, that's when he gets annoyed.
Another classic episode of Fawlty Towers.  This tape also contains the episodes: The Anniversary and Communication Problems!",967075200,2,588,4.653846153846154
7807010,5,630024847X,"The health inspectors are invading, and they're none too happy about the condition of Fawlty Towers. Meanwhile, Basil discovers to his horror that Manuel is keeping a pet rat--which he describes as a ""filagree Siberian hamster""--in his bedroom, and decrees that little Basil must go. It's soon discovered that ""Basil"" has returned. The lunacy is helped by Basil leaping around screaming, ""The cat lives! Long live the cat!"" and Manuel's pathetic ""cow eyes.""
""Communication Problems"" ensue when an arrogant, deaf, half-blind lady arrives at Fawlty Towers and makes life hellish for the staff. To make matters worse, Basil bet some money on a horse -- and Sybil suspects it.
""The Anniversary"" is anything but blissful when Basil pretends to have forgotten his and Sybil's anniversary. Sybil responds by storming out in a huff -- just as guests arrive for a special anniversary surprise party. Basil tries to cover up his rapidly crumbling marriage in front of the suspicious guests, as Manuel and the chef duel over who gets to cook.
Do not miss this! Or I will sic filagree Siberian hamsters on you!",964051200,,1098,5.005464480874317

7807012,5,630024847X,"When you think they only made 12 episodes, and that John Cleese and Connie Booth took months to write them, you begin to understand why Fawlty Towers is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. The new releases are very nice,  and these three are keepers (If only they would have ditched The  Anniversary and put The Germans on this tape, it would have been proof of a  greater power)
All three are great episodes, but I must admit that I  think ""Basil The Rat"" is the most perfectly conceived episode of  television comedy EVER put to film, (Sorry, Chuckles the Clown, the Turkey  Drop and The Contest) After watching this tape, you too will be glad that  Franco did not have them all shot.",940464000,12,691,4.436507936507937
