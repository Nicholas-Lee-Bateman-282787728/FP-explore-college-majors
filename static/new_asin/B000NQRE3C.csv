2777772,1,B000NQRE3C,"Yes, somehow I bought this opus, then I realized this comrade is ex-commie, then I realized the guy stuck in 18th century, then I realized the guy discuss only what he wanna discuss etc. He does show you short pieces of old movies done mostly in US and talk endlessly how he interpret them. Very soon it became clear he is ranting his opinion and, as he is a professor of philosophy, he is not interested in facts. Other strange point is he never mention any of his comrade's movies which amounts to another endless ranting. Word propaganda never mentioned and comrade professor has trouble connecting real life experiences and movies and, yes, he should know better. After all, all movies are fiction and there is nothing to talk about endlessly and theorize.
At worst movies are propaganda and at best entertainment. In short, comrade has nothing to say. Amen.",1376438400,2,862,4.753333333333333

2777774,5,B000NQRE3C,"It is expensive when you realize that the 3 parts come in one DVD, but after all it's worth every penny. Slavoj Zizek books are great, and this movie by Sophie Fiennes with him as the main voice, is as great, insightful and funny as the books.",1359590400,9,243,4.191489361702128

2777776,4,B000NQRE3C,"the cinema is the ultimate pervert art, says slavoj zizek, the brilliant left wing provocateur. dubl of philosopher and psychoanalist, the slovenian zizek tries to bring back the art of interpretation focusing in the levels cinema moves our desire. a film, as any work-of-art, do not tells us what to desire but how we desire; as zizek says, desire is not natural in us: we must be taught to desire. To do this, sofhie fiennes puts zizek inside the movies as a endogetic comentator of the films, which are read by a freudian/lacanian perspective. after viewing this film (or films, because there are 3 parts) we all shall have the desire to see the many films zizek talks about during this doc. it is the minimum desire we should have after seeing it...",1285027200,6,753,4.669172932330827
2777777,5,B000NQRE3C,"You get a lot of bang for your buck with The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, and it's guaranteed to blow your mind. Three 50 minute sections direct from the whirling mind of the ever-clever Slavoj Zizek, brilliantly illustrated by Sophie Fiennes. It's hard to overpraise this film - it completely changes the way you watch movies. Like the New York Times said: ""The clips from Hitchcock and Lynch films are so numerous and Mr. Zizek's comments so incisive that after watching ""The Pervert's Guide to Cinema,"" you may never see these directors' movies the same way again.""
I've watched this film over and over - it's better than any Film 101 class at university.",1255564800,26,656,4.7631578947368425
2777778,5,B000NQRE3C,"How surprising that this has not done better than it has.  Divided into three parts, each building on the preceding but reaching an even deeper level of analysis than its predecessor.  Here, Slavoj Zizek applies Freudian ideas to great effect--illustrating his points with vignettes taken from a well-known films. Particularly engaging, is how he applies Freud's ideas about dreams to films, revealing them in ways that will forever change how you see them and, really, any movie you might later see.  While it is hard to describe, this documentary in which Zizek gesticulating appears frequently, remains remarkably graphic in its illustrations.  Where even the texture of things takes on a whole new meaning.",1250985600,19,710,5.256637168141593

8180760,5,B000NQRE3C,"Told with such candor, its hard to believe he is serious. Its like watching your dreams turn to nightmare because all along you knew the subliminal messages were trying to get through.  Finally, here you get a preacher who can preach away any pretense of normalcy and leave you feeling superior in your cinematic intelligence. THE BIRDS, PSYCHO, MUHOLLAND DR. The Marx Brothers..... its in there!",1475452800,3,396,5.0

8180762,5,B000NQRE3C,"Wonderful! Using clips from memorable films the Freudian philosopher reveals our inner-most madness. I would love to see more intelligent films like this. Luckily, we have The Pervert's Guide to Ideology - another must see.",1442102400,,223,5.4

8180766,5,B000NQRE3C,"Zizek is an intellectual giant of our era.  His witty and fun look at movies is a riot.  Europeans will understand this humor, but Americans may need to feel more right wing pain to accept the humor and ""new think"" philosophy of Zizek.",1392681600,4,235,4.441860465116279
8180767,5,B000NQRE3C,"In this two hours and a half documentary, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek uses psychoanalytic theory to analyze clips of many classic films. As a theory of human behavior, psychoanalysis is quite outdated, surpassed by more biologically centered theories of the brain. However, psychoanalysis has undeniably influenced many famous directors in the past (for instance, Alfred Hitchcock or David Lynch, and Zizek analyzes here clips of their films), so in this sense this movie is interesting to have a hint of what these directors might be getting at. This film is very entertaining (Zizek is quite a character in his own right, with his thick accent, gesticulating body and wildly hypothetical theories) even if the ideas put forward here are probably wrong and outdated. The films Zizek spent more time analyzing here are Vertigo, Blue Velvet, Psycho, The Birds and Lost Highway, but aside from Hitchcock and Lynch, there are clips from other directors, such as Kubrick, Chaplin, Tarkovsky and others. And in a one of the more interesting parts, he shows us a Disney cartoon from 1935 called Pluto's Last Judgment, and we see how it surprisingly mirrors the Stalinist show trials of a few years later. Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph and Joseph) directs. She wisely makes Zizek talk from sets that mimics some of the movies he is analyzing.",1391212800,6,1344,5.085972850678733
8180768,5,B000NQRE3C,"This is an astounding, hilarious whirling deep dive into the the cinematic superego, ego and id.  I've not seen anything like it.  It's as if Freud and Jung were whispering in Slavoj Zizek's ear.  If this all sounds a little ""too deep"", be assured that it is very accessible and just hilarious.  Watch this before you see another movie.  Especially Hitchcock.  Be sure to turn on the subtitles, because there are none within the movie itself.",1389484800,7,442,4.75
