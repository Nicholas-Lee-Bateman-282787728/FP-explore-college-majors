Like any other, I brought home work that I needed to complete before the next day.  After I finished my work, I put my dvd in.

7974359,4,B000077VUB,"An excellent buy!  I enjoyed every song and especially loved ""Falling In Love With Jesus"" by Jonathan Butler.  He has a beautiful vocal range.  Kirk's son Kyle did an outstanding job with his song as well, and it is always a pleasure listening and watching Mr. George Duke.  I saw Kirk Whalum in concert along with George Duke a few weeks ago, so seeing them captured on DVD was an extra treat.  True Gospel fans will not be disappointed in this find.",1156550400,,451,4.451219512195122
7974360,5,B000077VUB,"I am SO impressed with Kirk Whalum's Project. I haven't been listening to much gospel music lately because it was getting harder for me to differniate between the beat from the lyrics. No offense to the J.Moss', Kiki Shepards' or Tonex' but I don't want to find myself unknowningly grinding on the dance floor to a praise song only after comprehending the lyrics midway through the song. Kirk's Project makes no mistakes or aplogizes for praising God using jazz. Brother Kirk's project aren't jazzy renditions of gospel standards--it's a kalediscope of modern contemporary jazz sounds. And Mr. Whalum includes some of the best musicians on this second project--jazz pianist extordinaire George Duke, bass guitarist Paul Jackson Jr., percussionist Luis Conti, guitar man Jonathan Butler and vocalist Tata Vega.

Although I love this whole project, my personal favorite is the latin tune--EL TODOPODEROSO featuring Tata Vega. I BARELY speak Espanol but I can't help feeling chills everytime I see (and hear) it. It's a Afro-Cuban gem! A close second would be the beautiful melody that Whalum's son co-wrote (and performed) on SEASONS. Watch out jazz world--this 18 year old is fixing to fly! I can't wait until father and son do their thing. But one of the most pleasant surprises in purchasing this DVD is to find out that the Johnathan Butler tune, FALLING IN LOVE WITH JESUS, appears on this project. For the last few weeks, I've been hearing this on the radio but could never get through to the station that played it so that I could go out and buy the album. And yes...I am going to buy this DVD as late Christmas presents for a few of my friends and family.

Basically, one can not go wrong in buying this DVD. It appeases those folks who don't believe that jazz can be used to praise God as well as us traditional ""church heads"", i.e. Southern Baptist, AME, CME, COGIC folk. It's music for everyone.  It'll make you want to buy the CD. And the amazing thing about Mr. Whalum's music is that you won't feel guilty in moving to it. It's pleasantly sacredly funky! 8-) To think--this has been out for TWO WHOLE YEARS and I am just know finding out about it!  Well all I can say is that if Mr. Whalum is ready to do Chapter III in the near future, I will make it a point to be there in Los Angeles for the next recording! I don't just want to listen to great gospel music--I want to be a part of that wonderful praise service.

Kudo's to you Brother Whalum! And if you do plan on doing one next year, I would love to see what you and other artists like Andre Crouch, Walter Hawkins, Cedric Dent (of Take 6) or Kim Burrell could do together. Talk about a jazzy praise there boy. Whew! I can't even imagine it. The heavens will sho nuff tell it!",1104624000,14,2744,4.557809330628803
