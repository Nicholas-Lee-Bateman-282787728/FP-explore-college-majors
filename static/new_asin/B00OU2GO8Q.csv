6761236,4,B00OU2GO8Q,"A Danish police procedural featuring an engaging cast of characters.  The writers do a nice job with the plots and the characters, despite constraining themselves in ways that American writers would not.  Good guys and innocents almost never suffer permanent harm, but despite that there are ample thrills.  There is some gunplay and things going bang, but somewhat less than in a comparable American production.

The dialog seems less purple, and the sparring between police and perpetrators is more mature than comparable American shows.

Subtitled in English, even when the characters are speaking English, which makes for an interesting challenge, since I have to keep my eyes on the screen at all times to keep up with the action.

The opening is captivating, between the haunting Misen anthem ""Forgiveness"" and the dramatic atmospheric landscape shots of Iceland (at least, I think it's Iceland).",1423267200,5,902,5.2727272727272725

6761238,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"I watched this series online when it briefly appeared on Netflix. Wanted to have it in my permanent collection so ordered it and watched it again as soon as it arrived. Excellent casting and superlative acting from all the principals, especially Jens Albinus. The crime TV series has been developed to a high art by the Scandinavians, and The Eagle is right up there with the best of the best. Not just absorbing and gritty plots, but credible, sensitive portrayals and solid directing.",1423094400,8,486,4.867469879518072
6761239,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"I love this series and have all three. Wish for more! Buying on Amazon was great, arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect playing condition. Also bought a Non Region DVD player to enjoy all the European DVDs i want to watch.",1421884800,,227,4.3023255813953485

6761242,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"I first saw this program on Netflix Streaming and then it was gone and I could not find it anywhere. I looked for a year or more and I finally found it,  I think it is one of the best shows in or out of this genre.  I wish there were more.",1456099200,,239,3.576923076923077

6761246,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"I have watched all the season one episodes and the first of season two. I love this show. The scenery is interesting and fun to see. The writing is good, although it is mostly captioned. Sometimes they speak perfect English. The bad guys are really bad which is necessary for a show like this. Note: the first 20 minutes or so of episode one is slow and I wondered if I had made a mistake buying it but it quickly picks up and draws one in to the characters. Recommended for certain.",1441065600,3,483,4.260869565217392

6761249,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"Yes,  this was also 'great' .......and I was also 'sad' when I had seen all the episodes ....and there are no more.  I recognize now a lot of the actors (in other Danish films).  They are so talented !l
I can only hope that Amazon will continue to feature such superb programs.  There is no other venue
that I am aware of that has as many 'great' films .....as Amazon.  Thank you !",1433980800,3,381,4.164383561643835

6761258,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"Great series of a Danish crime unit.  There are side stories on each character, great scenery - not all shots are in interior studio shots - and complex plots.  Try this series - you will like it!",1430006400,,196,4.27027027027027
6761259,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"Couldn't believe how old this series is because it is still so pertinent to recent times. Everything about this show is so different and refreshing compared to American crime stories. Each episode is very fulfilling in that you get a complete sense of who each character is and the storyline has enough resolution yet has a teaser at the end to make you want to continue watching the next episode. In other words, it's not frustrating.

Another thing, people look more ""real."" We are allowed to see wrinkles,furrows, pores, even crooked teeth and yet they are still attractive, only more approachable. It seems that no one in the permanent cast is under 40 except for the computer whiz and maybe Nazim. Love watching this show!!

Need to buy all three seasons. Don't know why it got pulled off the air. anyone out there know?? Anyway, this will not disappoint you. Promise!",1430006400,7,873,4.774834437086093

8684925,5,B00OU2GO8Q,"I just love these Danish Crime series, something about the sound of the language, the human quality of the characters, the beautifully done camera work, it all adds up to being very mysterious, on top of the fact that it is a murder mystery series. The 3rd season does get a bit too dark for some.
And the characters are quirky and dysfunctional sometimes/often, but I like that.",1494892800,,379,4.588235294117647
