The quality of this DVD is terrible.  Not widescreen.  The video hasn't been cleaned up.  Not SurroundSound... not even in stereo.  It looks like it was dubbed from a second-hand video  library video.
Ashes of Time is one of my most favourite movies.  A  multi-award winning movie (14th HK film awards).  From a director who won  the cannes film festival (for Happy Together).  To see it produced with so  little respect makes me very sad.  It is a crime against humanity.

With an all-star Hong Kong cast and set in the past based on a novel, the screen adaptation is really about lost love rather than the  killers throughout the story. Another thing worthy of mentioning is martial  arts directions in this film are by Samo Hung. Both visually stunning and  mind-bending, the movie ends in a casual manner almost like Wong was just  closing a door. Click-cleck. Winner of four or five awards, as far as I  know.

1224726,5,B00000INVJ,"The name of Wong Kar Wai is widely known all around the world. Since his cult film 2946, this master director has elolaborated an own style among the most brilliant filmmakers of his generation.

Ashes of time is a memorable metaphor, a long introspective journey to the variegated corners soul as well as a thoughtful reflection about the human condition.

A mercenary lives alone in the desert. But as the movie goes on he makes an inward gaze as result of the mistakes of his relatives.

An original proposal and magnificent film to watch.",1387065600,,542,4.74468085106383
1224727,4,B00000INVJ,"So Wong Kar Wai further HIDES Jing Yong's representation of the two Axis tag team partners as arthouse relationship neurotics.

LOLZ

Toxic West (German) embeds himself in the desert (Uighurs!!), training, egging on others to kill one another.  Pervert East (Japan) played by the WRONG TONY (Leung Kar Fai - sorry) moans about wanting to see the PEACH blossoms ;) while trying to get the RIGHT TONY (Leung Chiu Wai) to drink the amnesia wine (Japan wants everyone to forget what Japan did to everyone else) but RIGHT TONY who is GOING BLIND REFUSES because Pervert East (Japan) damaged his wife and called it adultery.

Meanwhile Maggie seems to be dying of consumption or some other illness of immobility/lethargy but continues to refuse Pervert East (Japan)'s attentions pretending that she is PINING for Toxic West (German).

1224728,5,B00000INVJ,"Wong Kar Wai is one of those directors who creates such vividly beautiful art pieces that his films become languid and dreamy in composition, truly evoking a physical reaction to each and every frame.  Even his lesser works (`My Blueberry Nights', and despite critical approval I personally didn't care for `Chungking Express') are so visually intoxicating that I can't look away.  I can't help but want to watch his films.

`Ashes of Time' just so happens to be one of his masterpieces, a truly original and breathtaking journey into the mind of the man who gave us one of the greatest film trilogies of all time (well, we can just say it's the greatest).

This complicated plot may take a little effort to sink into, but I promise you that it is worth all that effort.  It is also so fluid in movement that the complications become almost uncomplicated as the film grips the audience and tosses them from side to side as if by the waves of the ocean.  The film basically tells the story of Ou-yan, a hired hand who is crippled from a broken heart.  When he is contracted by two opposing parties to kill the same man, a man he considers a friend, he meets a moral dilemma that threatens to unhinge his sanity.  As the film builds on this premise and unfolds secrets in the plot and allows each character to fully develop, `Ashes of Time' becomes clearer and clearer and rises in the ranks as one of Kar Wai's finest achievements.

With shockingly beautiful imagery and a cast that digs VERY deep, this is an unforgettable experience, but just a mere movie.",1381276800,,1557,4.571942446043166

I'm glad the Blu ray works on my player, although the actor and actress interviews in the special features won't play.  Not sure why... anyway, Wong Kar Wai remains my favorite and most respected director of all time!

1224731,5,B00000INVJ,"I love Wong Kar Wai and his movies, 2046 and this movie especially. It's difficult to explain if you haven't seen his movies before but the stylistic nature and meditation on life and love that his movies are typified by are completely unusual. You don't see this anywhere else (that I know of) and, if it's your bag, it's incredible.

As for the Redux versus the original - I've watched both. The original (DVD) was almost unwatchable due to poor resolution and choppy picture. The Redux was much easier on the eyes and cut out scenes that were utterly confusing.

That isn't to say that Ashes of Time Redux is NOT confusing - it is. But, as with any excellent form of art, it is improved when revisited.",1359417600,3,705,4.5
1224772,2,B00000INVJ,"I watched the movie the first time in a theater in Taiwan about 20 years ago. As the credits rolled at the end the crowd boo'ed and largely classified the movie as a failure. This redux is about the same.  Art house reviews will praise this as a ""masterpiece"" but even the actors and crew suggested this was one of WKW worst films.  He simply had a vision that was too grand and had to stymy it down into this compressed version of a movie.  For those in the know, this is an epic tale that spanned 3 books and although this movie is loosely tied to the books, the characters lacks all background to make it significant to the audience (for instance Jacky Cheung's ).  This was a failure the first time around and nothing's changed.",1358985600,2,732,4.321167883211679

1224774,2,B00000INVJ,"I'm all for movies with complex storylines and characters but this movie's characters were monotone. They were all a bit psychotic with nothing else to them. SPOILER ALERT: There's the woman with the double personality of being herself and her brother who loves his ""sister"" (really herself) too much to let her love another man besides him aka herself. The sister who wants to be free of the brother hires a swordsman to kill her brother but the swordsman (knowing about the double personality) never does because how could the sister pay him after the brother's death? She would be dead. (yea think about that for a minute). Then there is the man who fights a gang of bandits on the last day he has even the most remote ability of eyesight left (he's going blind) and confides to the swordsman about how his wife loves his brother (who happens to be the swordsman by the way)  and I never did understand why he fought the bandits while blind which leads to his death. A host of other characters like the two above are the mainstay of this movie. Then there is the central figure. A lone swordsman for hire who seems to live his life watching from his home such odd characters come and go as they sort out their mental issues. The movie delved too deep into the mental disturbances of human nature without balancing itself.",1344729600,2,1324,4.563025210084033

1224776,5,B00000INVJ,"Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of Time is an amazing film. You could take away all story whatsoever, and it would still be an absolutely hypnotic and captivating film. As it is, the writer/director practically does this. He creates a labyrinth of memory of his film images, much in the way that memory can be deflective. And as an exercise in deflective memory, the film tells a story much in the way a mystery story develops. It is about getting to the bottom of a mystery. A mystery of human character and motivation. The film takes place in the desert where Leslie Cheung works as a cynical go between for hired swordsmen. Much of the film relates the short stories around the characters Cheung meets. My favorite story is the Brigitte Lin segment of the film. Now Brigitte Lin has made a career of gender ambiguous roles (Deadliest Melody, Swordsman II & III, Peking Opera Blues, etc...) Her role in Ashes is the perfect coda for much of her work in the wuxia genre. The film uses this intertextual reference to the genre in a way that is totally new and fresh. Her character(s) is(are) played with such confused pathos and subtlety. She is something of an eternal mystery, a mystery that will be eternally virgin, i.e., never known. It's an amazing performance. Speaking of genres, the film is a pure wuxia kung-fu film, with a musical and visual blend of styles drawn from Westerns, Samarai epics, and Wong Kar Wai's own unique cinematic vision. And it is Wong Kar Wai's unique vision that makes Ashes so unique and powerful as a film. This is not a film about swordplay. This is a film about human character and motivation. It is a deep and complexly interwoven meditation on memory. It is about the nature of regret and how ""the past"" can be deeply damaging to the soul. It explodes a Buddhist aphorism about the importance of being present, into a tapestry woven around a parable of magic wine that dissolves all memory. Leslie Cheung's character reminds me of Bogart's in Casablanca. He is a jaded character with the potential for real heroism, yet is trapped in a wasteland limbo watching the lives of desperate human flotsam at the fringe of the world. This limbo experience, is called a ""bardo"" in Buddhism. It is a place of repetitive patterns, a closed circle of dead end behavior and emotional states. A friend once told me that David Lynch's films are all about the bardo experience. People trapped in the bardos. Well, meditating on Wong Kar Wai's films, I think one could say the same thing. Especially, ""2046"", which many people consider his best film. It's actually a sequel to ""In the Mood for Love"", a film which I prefer between the two. 2046 definitely, and very consciously, plays with the theme of the bardos. And this current obsession, Ashes of Time, tells the story of a man trapped in a bardo who eventually escapes and finds freedom. It is a story where many people find freedom from repetitive patterns that trap or limit them. It is a film of profound interiority and meditative processing, yet it is firmly alive in the ebb and flow of interconnected humanity. Want to see a powerfully romantic, sad, and melancholic film of highest artistry? May I recommend Ashes of Time.",1304467200,6,3198,4.682060390763765

That said, evidently some versions of this movie please some people.  I have to admit, there is something there, I'm  not  too sure what.  Imitation Morricone soundtrack kept me looking for Clint Eastwood in his poncho just over the  next sand dune, but he never materialized.

If I come across a used Blu ray of this I may give it another  look.  I'm not sure if I saw 'Ashes of Time', or  the Redux version, the  title on the cassette box was all in Chinese and on two tapes, even though the running time was only 100 minutes.  Go figure.",1282262400,,822,4.3509933774834435

1224780,5,B00000INVJ,"Dennis A. Amith and UbiK did very fine reviews of the film. BUT those who just don't read, if you didn't know, Wong Kar-Wai, for the most part, had no choice but to re-edit just about everything for this film because: 1. The original stock footage (also ""in pieces"") was stored in a warehouse which was about to be shut down, and rid of everything into ""ashes"". 2. Many of the original film footages/audios were also too damaged to repair/display, PLUS he had to run all over the world to recover all the distributed negatives he sent out to other companies (14-15 yrs. ago), whatever left he could find. 3. It was his first project, his ""baby"", through his independent film company, and didn't want the film to age or get lost somewhere else any longer. 4. Therefore he decided to restore and re-edit it, plus there was never a proper western distribution of the film, and also realized, after all these years, how much importance this film (and influence) has actually become... (These reasons can be non-linear too! and still make sense)

I have to disagree that the film's a mess, as some say it is. It is a non-linear film to begin with, and not without reason. It's a journey through a man's thoughts and his random encounters with the people that visit him, who, the most of them, happen to loosely connect/indirectly connect to his life or remind him of his past, and even reveal a bit of their own inner-self turmoil, etc. Kar-Wai's execution is the same way of maybe how Ouyang Feng would remember things of whatever surfaced to his thoughts first, yet it still comes full-circle to emphasize the thing that haunts him most. It may sound like some random things taken out of each and everyone's journal, but they're still events that occurred in that one's life. If you pay attention to detail or things most people take for granted, you realize how much greater things are. And once again, the film is played out (in my interpretation) how Ouyang Feng possibly registers his thoughts. If you realize, he's a bit delusional and/or cynical anyways, since his life-turning event that's lead him to live in the middle of the desert; or maybe yet more discombobulated in the head than we think since, at one point in time in the past, he had one straight mind-set which was to become the greatest swordsman, which came to a sudden stop.

If you expected many action scenes (still neat, for the few brief scenes there was), the film was never driven by that purpose. Find action in Mr. Wong's directorial debut film, As Tears Go By.

In conclusion, I hope I said all the main things behind this film and what I wanted to say, in counter to the negative or confused views or who's new and curious of this film. Wong Kar-Wai set out to preserve this beloved and important film in a very sticky-slow, painstaking, and many unfortunate, process. Also, to one reviewer - you can't compare this to 'CTHD', because 'AT' was one of the major reasons why 'CTHD' came out the way it came out. Plus, both films' storytelling are the polar opposite of each other... yet two great milestone films for the greatest of cinema. The 'Redux' has quite a bit of changes, yet Kar-Wai said, after the reconstruction, that this is THE definitive version of the film he realized he was looking to make.",1249171200,9,3284,4.61986301369863
1224781,2,B00000INVJ,"On principle, I object to filmmakers going back years later and re-editing and rethinking a movie they made. But if you're going to fiddle with the past, at least present the new cut side by side with the original, something this DVD fails to do. Not that it matters: director Wong kar Wai hasn't had any more luck creating a compelling drama out of this mannered action flick that prefigures the unique style of his that would flower on great films like Chungking Express and In The Mood For Love. But everything he attempts here -- basically trying to bring a depth of performance and genuine conflict to an action flick -- is done much better by Ang Lee with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

1224894,3,B00000INVJ,"The original movie Ashes of Time was a masterpiece and gets 5 stars. Every shot of the film was like a painting, every line of dialogue was poetry.

The only thing I like about the redux is the sharper images. The new music is not half as effective as the old music. The added titles severed the film into sections and disrupted the flow of the film. The new editing destroyed Leslie Cheung's narrative and rhythm of the film.  I hate the bright yellow tint in desert scenes and green tint in some other scenes that make them look annoyingly unnatural. Brigitte Lin's dialogue was changed from the original Cantonese to Mandarin and sounds stiff, but is tolerable.

1224895,5,B00000INVJ,"Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME has for many long-time fans of HK action cinema of the 80s and 90s been a kind of unrealised masterpiece. For years we've struggled along watching inferior prints of the film that seemed to reflect the visceral graininess of the desert which features so prominently in the narrative - until now!

Beautifully restored, with a re-recorded soundtrack, Wong Kar Wai's  homage to HK action cinema is both a loving celebration and a bittersweet mourning of its passing.
Therefore it's a real treat for all cineastes!

A meditation on change, loss and regret focusing on the darkening days and decline of five swordsmen through interconnecting episodes, ASHES is a deconstruction of  HK martial arts cinema (which by 1994 had had better days), a bold and avant garde reinterpretation of the genre's conventions as well as a homage to the classic films of Tsui Hark, the Shaw brothers and Sergio Leone westerns.

The cast is mouthwatering! Just look at those names!!! It reads like a who's who of HK cinema! As to be expected from a cast of this caliber the acting is magnificent. Particularly outstanding are Brigitte Lin who is spellbinding as a schizophrenic swordsman and an empathetic Tony Leung C-W, a fighter for hire who is rapidly losing his sight. The late, great Leslie Cheung turns in a complex, morally ambiguous performance, Jacky Cheung shines as a young swordsman attempting to preserve a sense of chivalry in changing times, Maggie Cheung is radiant and Carina Lau delivers considerable sensuality in what a lesser actress would consider a minor role.

The location of the film is set entirely in a desert, metaphorically depicting the desolation of the characters, which is beautifully lensed by the peerless Christopher Doyle. Some of the shots he achieves have resonated with me for years.

The soundtrack is also extraordinarily beautiful, enhanced by the addition of virtuoso Yo Yo Ma. It's arguably one of the best scores in HK action cinema and an obvious influence on Tan Dun's ""Hero"" compositions.

In fact ASHES OF TIME is the perfect antidote to the overtly nationalistic, overblown, spectacle-driven Chinese epics of Zhang Yimou that have (unfortunately) come to set the standard for martial arts cinema in contemporary popular consciousness.
Therefore fans of the more recent Chinese fantasy films may find ASHES a difficult viewing because, as typical to his style,  Wong Kar Wai delivers a personal, character-driven piece, that is minimalist in action set-pieces and expansive in both scenery and emotional development.

By ""reduxing"" this landmark film we are given a timely reminder of the creative, cultural roots of the HK martial arts genre but we are also called to reflect upon its demise.",1240272000,11,2751,5.093333333333334

1224899,4,B00000INVJ,"A complex but beautiful film with characters and a storyline that has so much layers, it's very hard even 15-years later to even describe.

Wong Kar-wai's ""ASHES OF TIME"" which is an adaption of Louis Cha's popular novels ""The Legend of Condor Heroes"" but yet unrelated gets remastered and re-edited and has been released in theaters in 2008 under the title ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" and will be released on DVD in March 2009.

The choice of revisiting the film was due to a major film warehouse going into bankruptcy in 1998 and Kar-Wai was asked to pick up his film or lose it.  Upon finding the film, the film was in pieces.  Kar-Wai knew that he wanted to re-edit the film, part of the challenge that he faced was trying to get the film from International distributors and literally having to go worldwide in trying to get the film footage needed to restore the film and then re-editing it.

Five years in trying to get the pieces and restoring it, the film has been reduced from 100 minutes to 93 minutes.  ADR could not have been done but there was new digital color tinting, digital effects and altered scenes which certain music-based scenes were removed and also some parts during the battle.

So, essentially, what we are seeing is Wong Kar-wai's final vision of ""ASHES OF TIME"".  Whether or not ""REDUX"" is for you, to tell you the truth, I think that for many people, unless you got hold of the film on DVD and recently watched it, I would assume that many people, like myself, who  probably won't remember the film plot may not be able to tell the differences between the original and the re-edited version.  Especially with so much time has passed but if this is Wong Kar-wai's definitive cut, then so be it, I would rather watch the film as he intended it to be.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

I understand the challenges they faced during the restoration and remastered process of having to go worldwide for certain parts of the film because the original film was in pieces and in bad shape.  But for fans of Wong Kar-wai and even Christopher Doyle's cinematography, the film was what ""HERO"" did for many in 2002 but in this case, back in 1994.  The film was avant-garde for its time and the cinematography was just amazing.

For ""REDUX"", visuals and digital color tinting and digital remastering has brought out a lot of the earthtones, the greens, the blues and where the outdoor scenery  are quite beautiful, there are other scenes on video that looked great from Maggie Cheung's lipstick to just how color was a big part of the film.

With that being said, I struggle with with my review because after watching the Criterion Blu-ray disc of ""Chungking Express"" (which was released in the same year as ""ASHES OF TIME"" in 1994), I saw how Criterion really made the film look great 15-years later.  Although, I'm not watching ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" on Blu-ray, I couldn't help but notice the amount of grain in the film.

I'm typically not against grain because film is supposed to have grain but I found the graininess in full force.  In fact, some scenes seemed a bit blurry at times.  This was more evident in the beginning but as the film progressed, grain was noticeable but yet you start to notice about the positive things such as the acting, cinematography and the music.

As for audio, the film features a re-edit and that includes the score.  For the most part, the film is pretty much dialogue-based.  Dialogue is clear and the use of the rear channels for the music was nicely done for some scenes.

But overall, I didn't notice anything spectacular during the battle scenes, if anything it was during the musical sequences.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" DVD features three special features.  They are:

  * Born from Ashes: The Making of ASHES OF TIME REDUX - This featurette features interviews with Wong Kar-wai, Christopher Doyle, some of the talents in the film, Yoyo Ma and others.  The featurette was informative but to tell you the truth, for those wanting to know the differences of REDUX rom the original, you're not going to find it on this featurette.
  * Q&A with Wong Kar-Wai - This 45-minute featurette features an interview with Wong Kar-wai which I assume was for the New York Film Festival Q&A session in late 2008.  This was an awesome featurette as you got to go into the mind of Wong Kar-wai and some rumors put to rest such as ""is it true that Wong Kar-wai doesn't use scripts"" to learning about how challenging it was for the HK stars to work in mainstream China and travel over there.  Cast and crew had major difficulties filming in the desert and how Maggie Cheung refused to go to China, thus her shots were all indoor in Hong Kong.  Learning about his relation with his editor William Chang and DP Christopher Doyle and how the three are a great team.  A lot of interesting tidbits of facts for those who are curious about Wong Kar-Wai's work.
  * ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" Trailer

Let me first say that I enjoyed ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" for its cinematography and the acting by all those involved.  Visually, at that time and even now, knowing how challenging it was for Wong Kar-Wai, Christoper Doyle and the cast to film ""ASHES OF TIME"", what they were able to create in the end was artistic.  But at the same time, the overall plot can be a bit complex for some.

It's a film that has so many layers and I've watched this film many times in the past and watched ""REDUX"" twice now, just to see what I can get from it. And each time, I do... it's a melancholic feeling of loneliness, sadness, rejection, betrayal but aside from the visual aspect and the complexity of the film, I guess it depends on the viewer for interpretation and what they get out of it.

Throughout the years, I've met may who have been able to watch this film and look at it as an early masterpiece by Wong Kar-Wai.  For me, from 15 years ago and today, I still feel that the film set many things in motion for current martial arts films in Hong Kong and how far one can go if they put all they have to it.

I realize Wong Kar-Wai calls this his ""Days of Being Wild"", when he and his team created this film and overcome a lot of challenges of filming in Western China, Christopher Doyle using no tripod or dollies.  And really pushing the envelope of HK filmmaking in 1994.  And they continue to do it today.

So, I see ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" for what it accomplished when it first was released in 1994 and how it paved the way for many HK martial arts/wuxia genre-based films.  Before a film like ""HERO"" or ""RED CLIFF"", what ""ASHES OF TIME"" did for me was show determination, hope and creativity.

""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" on DVD does shows its age and is hampered with a lot of grain but with his other 1994 film ""Chungking Express"" receiving the Blu-ray treatment, I often wonder if going 1080P high-definition improve the video quality dramatically.

I will say that the two featurettes included on the DVD is priceless.  Any interviews with Wong Kar-wai on video are quite rare and thus, I really enjoyed the inclusion of those two.

All in all, ""ASHES OF TIME REDUX"" is definitely a nostalgic piece of avant-garde filmmaking and beautiful cinematography.  But it's one of those films that either one gets it or they don't.  Nevertheless, it's a Wong Kar-wai film worth watching.",1235520000,41,7303,4.544758990053558
1224900,5,B00000INVJ,"This is a region-free import from the U.K.  Note that while the movie itself (and the menu) will play on a U.S. machine, the extras are in PAL and therefore will not.  The picture quality is uneven, but I think that has more to do with the limitations of the source than the transfer.  For the most part, the image on this Blu-ray Disc looks good.

The movie is excellent.  It is rather depressing, and it can be difficult to keep track of all the characters on your first viewing.  It also has constant voice-over throughout, so be prepared to read a lot of subtitles.  The action sequences (when they occur) are shot in an artsy style that may not appeal to all tastes.  Having said all that, this is a very rewarding film if you're willing to make the effort and be swept along with it.",1235347200,7,789,4.319727891156463
1224901,5,B00000INVJ,"(5 stars for ""Ashes of Time"", 1 star for this or any known DVD edition. What a shame.)

One of the best most awarded films and one of the most deep explorations of loneliness and sorrow, justly ranking among the best produced Honk Kong films of the 90's, this mysterious and sensual portrayal of sadness and melancholy is often mistaken for the typical swordsplay action film, dissapointing and even boring the fans of the genre. But make no mistake: This is an Art film in capital letters, a profound and oblique vision within the human soul, based on a non-linear development, flashbacks and voiceovers, with total character emphasys, expressionist camera and enveloping soundtrack, about the pain and intense regrets of the past and memories. The Wuxia film people expects, happens to be only the scenario for this striking epic tale about the meditation of love and the scars of the soul. Never the less, the mysticism provided by the ancient period and the arid landscapes, added to the skilled but tormented master swordsmen stereotype, is the essence and main appealing of the film. The action sequences by Sammo Hung are few and registered in a very particular and hard to digest fashion, like slow motion or kinetic blurry sequences, serving only the purpose of displaying dramatic consequences or graphic portayals of some characters.

Wong Kar Wai's sole intrusion in the popular Wuxia genre and recasting to the martial arts conventions, trascends the usual plot about honor, revenge, or the indominability of the spirit as a mere vehicle for showdowns and violent climax and vindication. Instead, he uses his incredible talent in creating a beautiful, dreamlike and stylised composition about memory, the irretriavability of the past and the consequent impossibility of love and happiness. The affecting enigmatic performances, the atmospheric stirring music, and the mesmerizing imagery of sterile alienating landscapes, are beyond  known emotional levels for the genre,  and the names of Kurosawa and Leone come out as possible influences, mostly because of  Christopher Doyle's gorgeous and lyrical cinematography providing livish visual poetry, as composer Frankie Chan (known as the manchu prince in ""The Prodigal Song"") creates the definitive Wuxia soundtrack, painting the atmosphere with delicate and sad sound layers accompanying the moments of deep revelations, or the loud rhytmic war fanfares of the epic battles.

The flaw of this otherwise perfect masterpiece, is that it requires more than one view to integrate the amount of  apparently diffuse elements of the non-linear and flashback style of the movie, as it is intellectually demading and highly stimulating. After the second or third viewing or a previous study of the plot, the experience can finally be rewarding, and once you're there, there's no turning back, as this movie steals your heart. Because this movie lacks of a single storyline, but it's based instead on different but connected characters and their memories, i would like to provide a short profile on each one for better understanding  of the plot and the degrees of  profoundity:

- Ouyang Feng (Leslie Cheung): Once known as Evil West, Feng ekes out a lonely existence as a hired sword and agent for other assasins in a remote desert abode. Getting on years and tormented by memories of lost love, he's the main narrator of the story and the connection between other characters. Cynic and Haunted by the past.

- Huang Yaoshi (Tony Leung Kar Fai):  Evil East, Ouyang's old friend and fellow swordsman, the emotionally crippled hero appears one day in Ouyang's home with a bottle of magic memory-erasing wine given my a mysterious acquaintance, as he drowns his lovelorn misery in it. Lonely and northless.

- Murong Yan / Yin (Brigitte Lin): A swordswoman with a split personality (Yan, the brother and Yin, the sister) inside a wounded soul, Yan hires Ouyang Feng to kill Huang Yaoshi as he betrayed his sister. Later, Yin also tries to hire Feng to kill her brother Yan, in a fair display of insanity and despair. Hungry for affection, hates herself.

- The Girl (Charlie Yeung): One day, the shy but determined Girl visits Ouyang Feng to hire him for revenge against the soldiers who killed his brother, with nothing to offer but a basket of eggs and an old mule. Feng declines, so she stays outside for days waiting for someone who can help her. Sad and vulnerable.

- Blind Swordsman (Tony Leung Chiu Wai): A colleague of Feng and Yaoshi, this enigmatic and sad character is looking for work as an assasin to raise money to return to his hometown and see the peach blossoms before he goes completely blind. Nostalgic and abandoned.

- Hong Qi (Jackie Cheung): A barefoot beggar with incredible fighting skills, he is often used by Feng in some dirty works. He is in searching of his old self before he got involved with Feng's bussiness and cinicism, and he found in The Girl outside Feng's house, the oportunity for redemption. The only optimistic character despite the circumstances.

Those are the basic characters, and their stories and relationships are developped as the movie moves forward in several climaxes for each one, as well as other secondary but also important appereances of Maggie Cheung and Carina Liu as abandoned lovers, bring some sense and connection to the drama.

Finally, please don't get me started on this or any DVD, VCD, or even VHS edition of this outstanding classic. The only decent edition of ""Ashes of Time"" is the MEI AH Hong Kong DVD, actually the Laser Disc translation with imbedded english/chinese subtitles , 1.0 mono, and not even a scene selection. Now wait, you think that's bad,this US edition is a total mess.

GOOD NEWS!!!!!! On October 10 2008, Sony Pictures will release ""Ashes of Time REDUX"", a new remastered version with extra footage and new soundtrack. I've heard it's quite amazing, as it was already released in other countries in many film festivals.

HOPE, is what keeps me to hang myself from the injustice of this criminal DVD edition. If you love Wuxia and romance asian style,like "" the bride with the white hair"", ""storm Riders"", ""Hero"", or ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"", don't miss this one. And please visit an Asian Movies online store for the Mei Ah edition of this classic.",1219017600,7,6303,5.007648183556405
1224952,1,B00000INVJ,"This DVD is one of the worst I've purchased.  I agree with the other reviewers about the quality: It's horrible.

This is what the film looks and sounds like on this DVD:

It looks like it was shot with a camcorder while the film was projected in a movie theater, with all images not centered.  There is a lot dirt and debris on the film reel.  The color is faded to the black side so colors are dull and morbid.  The bottom portion of the screen is blacked out for the English subtitles to display against.  There is some pixellation about 6 minutes into the movie and then the audio/video goes terribly out of sink (about 1-2 second delay).  The audio seems to have been recorded with a cassette tape and then transfered.

My assumption would be that this is a pirated movie except shot-in-the-theater pirated movies usually have much better quality.  I was actually expecting someone to stand up and walk across the screen.

About the film itself:

I cannot tell you what this film is about because I couldn't stand watching more than 8 minutes of the DVD.  I purchased it because this film by Wong Gar Wai was highly recommended by a respectable foreign film critic.

Do not waste your money.  I purchased this DVD at a local DVD store but was at least able to return it for store credit because of the audio/video sync issue.",1181433600,4,1330,4.483333333333333
1224953,1,B00000INVJ,"This DVD is a botched production job, and Amazon will charge you to return it because it's ""not the result of our error."" Amazon's error is to distribute this dog of a product. Wait for a better release. Caveat emptor.

The sound track lags several seconds behind the picture (and the subtitles) for the first 45 minutes of the movie. And there's a lot of dialog. It's almost impossible to figure out who is saying what to whom.

But maybe the visuals alone are worth it? Not really: The bottom quarter of the picture is blacked out, to cover the Chinese subtitles -- which nonetheless peek out from time to time when there are two lines of them. This provides a nice black background for the English subtitles (which contain the predictable dumb typos), but wouldn't you like to see the whole picture? I know I would.

Only a couple of times, there are pixilated intrusions of images from some other movie, with white people in it, for a second or two. Spoils the willing suspension of disbelief, you know?

And only once, there is a snatch of dialog in English -- not likely part of this movie, whose setting is earlier than the advent of English.

1224954,4,B00000INVJ,"'Ashes of Time' is the rarest of Wong Kar Wei's films and best remembered as the one that so confounded him that he went off and made 'Chungking Express' to clear his mind before finishing it. Actually, it's worth remembering in its own right, as he brings his uniquely romantic take on the world to the fantasy swordplay genre with the expected unexpected results. There are swordfights, most of them pretty good, but the fantasy is kept to the bare minimum with the focus on the emotional cost of being a professional killer. Love is lost and so are memories, vengeance is sought and denied, characters meet but fail to connect, secrets are kept and regrets shared, all filtered through Leslie Cheung's inn on the edge of the desert where he acts as agent for killers for hire. The interest here isn't in action but reasons, and in the emotional cost of pursuing a life of violence, all captured via his usual dreamlike imagery and poetic confessional narration. Part Hong Kong, part European, part Leone (acknowledged/plagiarised at times in the score), not everything works, but the parts that do are quite magnificent, whether it's a woman tracing her hand over the sleeping body of a man who is not her lover or the curiously memorable shots of the horse thieves waiting their turn in a battle.

It can get confusing - not only do the characters sometimes blur into each other but he even hires both Tony Leungs for key roles in the same film while Brigitte Lin plays dual roles and, just to add to the clarity, the film's chronology is very misleading - but it's worth bearing with. A film I'll definitely be returning to, and I suspect more than just the once.

However, this DVD edition is one to avoid for reasons already outlined in other reviews here. Instead, track down the Hong Kong Mei Ha release: the picture quality is grainy, but the English subtitling is much better handled.",1112659200,22,1895,4.687687687687688
1224955,3,B00000INVJ,"After reading a few rave reviews, I purchased this DVD and found it somewhat lacking. To its credit, there are some scenes that are quite beautiful; the combination of cinematography and acting combine to create beautiful moments. My favorite portion of the movie is about Yin/Yang. I think her fighting her schizophrenic reflection in the water is awesome (though the watery explosions just felt mega-cheesy). Beyond this, however, the story IS quite difficult to follow, and I found myself constantly asking ""Ok, is this the other guy or someone new...?"" I might find it more appealing after multiple viewings, as the story line might coalesce for me. I would proabably have gotten more out of the movie if I understood the stories from which it was derived; it's like watching the 2nd half of a movie. Now on the major downside, the transfer was clearly shaky - regardless of how good or bad translations are, they aren't always fully viewable on the screen. The fight scenes are sparse (which is ok), but most are filmed in ""BlurryVision"" - meaning most of the movement on the screen is nothing but whirling blurs with very cheesy-sounding effects. Were it a campy martial arts flick, I wouldn't mind, but when combined with the dramatic intensity of other scenes, it just feels completely misaligned, like I'm watching two different genres of movies that were spliced together. If you appreciated the precision and grace of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, with elegant choreography and nice wirework, don't expect to see any of that in Ashes of Time... just lots of blurs and maybe some blood. To some, the fights might seem er... artsy, but to me, they just look sloppy. Were this movie filled with more captivating dramaic scenes and without the blurry fights, I'd have liked it a lot more.",1070841600,7,1797,4.895081967213115

I have heard that some people did not understand the movie entirely and it is somewhat hard to comprehend. I was able to grasp the movie's meaning from the beginning only because I grew up hearing stories of Dong Shie and Ouyang Feng, characters by the popular author Jing Yong. Many people, not knowing the original story, do not realize that the movie tied together loose ends left by the author (such as why Ouyang and Hong hated each other from the start.) When I watched it, a sort of epiphany came over me. It was kind of like, ""Ohhh!!! That's why he named the island Peach Blossoms!"" Maggie Cheung was also wonderful in the movie--she appears in the last part of the film and the focus is only on her for a few minutes. However with only a few simple gestures and a red dress, she absolutely steals the spotlight.",1062201600,11,974,4.477528089887641

The central figure is a hermit who acts as an agent for roving mercenary samurai (called ""ronin""). As for the make-up of the film, it plays out disjointedly, much as one might reflect upon memories. Much of the plot ties are unclear until much later in the film... as it was meant to be. This is a not-to-be-missed piece of art.

1224961,3,B00000INVJ,"Watching this movie you kind of go, ""huh?"" a lot. The narrative is very deconstructed and at times incredibly confusing (Wong Kar Wai really digs Goddard). Nonetheless there is some sort of magic going on in this thing, as you come to find with his movies.
Some of the fight scenes are really cool and I like the way he juxtaposed slow-mo with fast action. Although, to be honest, I did grow tired of the constant flashy slom-mo stuff. And the first half I didn't really enjoy becuase I just had no clue what was going on (I suggest reading the blurb on IMDB, I think it would prove beneficial). In the latter half though, I sort of got into a rythm and really enjoyed it. It slowed down and there were some nice moments with this hot chick lamenting about love, as well as some really pretty shots. He's got a great eye for great little details. The scene with the basket reflecting in the room is really cool.
So, all in all, when all the ten year old boys have been purged and abused, I think I give it a B.
I would also recommend, if you liked this, to watch Chungking Express and In the Mood or love. They're simpler and have more of the good stuff from this movie.",1000857600,7,1170,4.251121076233184

This film has the distinction of being a CHK favorite of several friends of mine. However, those with a taste for CHK's action films may be disappointed by this movie becasue the emphasis is not on fighting. In fact, there is very little fighting, and what fighting there is tends to be filmed in a blurry slow motion style that gets points for artistic impressionism, but lacks the visceral assault of more conventional Hong Kong movies.
If you're a fan of world cinema, not just Hong Kong action movies, I highly reccommend it as it does have beautiful photography, mature themes, and it literally oozes atmosphere. By far, this is the most 'artsy' movie I've ever seen come out of Hong Kong, but I cannot give it 5 stars because the video has numerous digital glitches and choppy editing.

The DVD mastering, accoringly, is perhaps the greatest injustice the movie could have possibly suffered.  The source from which the DVD was dubbed was in *terrible* condition.  Your local rental store's VHS copy probably looks like it's in better shape.  The picture is very scratchy.
Even worse is the subtitling.  The subtitles in the VHS version were very thoughtfully written and give a good sense of the poetry of the original script.  The only problem is that they are sometimes a little (read: teeny bit) hard to read.  The DVD version ""overcomes"" this problem by BLACKING OUT the bottom 20% of the screen and displaying new subtitles on the black bar.
Two problems with this method - they didn't resize the picture at all.  You simply lose the bottom fifth of the picture.  Also, the subtitles in the DVD version are a much poorer translation of the original.  They are almost comical at times, they depart so far from Wei's original vision.

1225010,5,B00000INVJ,"""Ashes of Time,"" or ""Evil East Malicious  West""--roughly translated--is the crowning achievement of the Hong  Kong cult films director, Wong Kar-Wai.  While in the past Wong accentuated  the aspects of his films concerning desperation, depression, and  destruction, in ""Ashes of Time"" he deals with them more fully and  brings those chapters to a close.  Loosely adapted from the anthologies of  Jing Yung with characters such as Ouyang, Huang, Hong, and the transvestite  ""The Defeat-Seeking Loner,"" Wong introduces more intriguing and  complex characters into his story, enhancing its insight and coherence.  For those who don't understand Chinese--you lose SO much meaning in the  soliloquys and the dialogues.  Take notes while you watch this because the  love triangles are about to get complicated. Wong also seems to have found  a gimmicky cast that surprisingly delivers each and every time.  (Regulars  like Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Leslie Chen Guo-Rong, Brigitte Lin Ching-Ha, et  al., show wide ranges of performance.)  Again, Wong conjures the subjects  of refusal and the fear of refusal in ""Ashes of Time""--in a  historically fictional time and place of Chinese chivalry, withal.

The best looking dvd is OOP Japanese Pony Canyon dvd, but that has no English subtitles.
The OOP Taiwan dvd has a good transfer and hard coded English subtitles.  So for English speakers who do not speak Chinese, this is the one for you.",1420416000,10,698,4.403100775193798
