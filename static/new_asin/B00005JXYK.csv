1607830,1,B00005JXYK,"Awful kid's movie unless you turn off the sound and fast forward through some parts!

It shows kids stealing, spying, behaving spitefully, lying, disobeying adults, and badly whipping and spurring horses (until they bleed) and then actually gaining something by doing these things! It shows a young girl leaving the house at midnight to meet a strange man in the forest (the leprechaun, but still!).

They also call The White Pony a ""she"" but it is most definitely a ""he"".

Some nice scenery and lots of pretty shots of the white pony. Also some funny antics by the leprechaun.",1177545600,,577,4.808080808080808
1607831,5,B00005JXYK,"Holy Shoot this is the best darn movie about horsey's ever!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!It is now a band favorite. It really gets us stoked to rock the heck out of the audience. Brian Kelly (VII) Is a cinematography genius and I don't understand why this was overlooked by the Academy Awards.!!!!!...!!!

Please Brian,

WHITE PONY TWO!!!!!

Never Stop.

Never Stop.

1607832,3,B00005JXYK,"When a little girl named Leah (Carly Anderson) goes to visit relatives in Ireland, she meets a magical white mare called Sorcha and a charming leprechaun named Lucky (Warwick Davis). The three of them conspire to enter a big race, where Leah will have to compete with her evil cousin Shannon (Victoria Farrer).

This move was way too young for me -- it's not a kids & adult movie -- but small children are likely to fall for the pony and the leprechaun.

1607833,2,B00005JXYK,"My horse-crazy six-year-old is ho-hum about this one--jumbled mythology, wooden acting, contrived humor, flat characters, and above all--why on earth did they cast an obviously  male horse to play the role of a mare? Get ""Black Beauty"" (the 1994-ish one that features real horses) or ""The Black Stallion"" instead!",1076544000,,313,5.387755102040816
1607834,1,B00005JXYK,This movie made me cry! Not from saddness but from its terribleness!! I hate hokey horse movies that make the horse world look stupid and dumb. I have been around Horses my whole life and been on Pony Club for over half my life and knowing so much about horses I couldn't enjoy this movie at all...not even a little bit. But if you have a small child then they might like it b/c it was designed for the very very very young NOT the older people in the world.,1063497600,,458,4.1
1607875,3,B00005JXYK,"My kids enjoyed this for the horse action.
But, the mythology is quickly brushed over & could have been expanded upon. Lots of whining. The evil cousin is selfish & mean, but the lead character Leah wasn't with out her own selfishness. The Uncle is cardboard. The leprechaun is a far better actor than this (bring back Willow!).
For parental enjoyment get The Black Stallion.",1061510400,,375,4.7846153846153845
1607876,4,B00005JXYK,I wandered upon this movie while channel surfing and it was showing on HBO one afternoon while I was keeping my 6 yr. old granddaughter.  She loves horses and was facinated by this movie.  She wanted to have her own copy and has reminded me of that numerous times!  This will be a wonderful surprise for her this Christmas!,1005868800,,323,4.440677966101695
1607877,5,B00005JXYK,"This film is definatly aimed at young children, but be warned of Warwick Davies character and my own-Shannon, the evil cousin. This is a film set in Ireland which shows that if you keep believing in things they truly will come true. ps. I'm biased. ....",993340800,,253,4.521739130434782
1607878,5,B00005JXYK,"She, nor any of her friends, can not go a day without watching it at least once. I am on here to buy it for her now.  My daughter wasn't into horses until this movie, so be forwarned. :)",950918400,,186,3.769230769230769

7942529,5,B00005JXYK,"I first watched this movie when I was very young, Possibly 4 or 5 years old. I adore this movie, and I think I have seen this movie every year since then at least once. I have been watching this movie for 14 years, I am buying it now because with my track record it will be cheeper to buy then to rent if I continue to watch it every year. I think this is the movie that cemented my love of horses. I started riding lessons soon after I watched this movie, and haven't stopped. The movie is a really heartwarming tale. And I am still (in college) encouraging people who haven't seen this yet to see it. This is probably my most shared film other than The Last Unicorn. Actually I'm sensing a theme... But, I love this movie and I haven't met anyone who doesn't share my feelings for the movie.",1415404800,,793,4.1558441558441555
7942530,3,B00005JXYK,I gave the rating that I did because of the smile on my kid's face and the speed in which it took to arrive.  Based on that I would recommend it to others.,1400630400,,155,3.696969696969697

7942533,5,B00005JXYK,I bought this for my 16 year old daughter who watched the video tape until it broke when she was a child. She was so excited to see a memory from her past.,1394064000,,155,3.727272727272727
