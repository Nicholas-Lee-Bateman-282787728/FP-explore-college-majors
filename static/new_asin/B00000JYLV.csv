7913800,4,B00000JYLV,"Warlock 3 is the second best of the three Warlock movies. Warlock II is one of my favorite occult/horror/fantasy movies EVER. Part 3 is good but  Payne is not as good at being evil as Julian Sands is/was. Sands was BORN to play this role(the first few minutes of part 2?if you saw it, you know what I am saying). Sands reeks of evil. Payne is almost comical. Warlock III is good enough to buy but Warlock II rules! Warlock I was decent but once again, part 2 is excellent.",1277078400,,472,4.2444444444444445
7913801,3,B00000JYLV,"Bruce Payne (Operation Intercept, Ravager) when given enough air time and a role he can flex his abilities in can keep a viewer interested. And he does it here in ""Warlock III"". There is the usual teenybopper horror storyline but Payne surprises one in what would be just another sequel. Mostly kept in low-budget roles, Payne is capable of a sense of presence and cultured delivery. He exhibits it here. He's glossy stuff. If you like his work and want to see him weave a character into his own, this is it.",1016064000,4,508,4.532608695652174
7913802,3,B00000JYLV,"this isn't all that you might think it is, definitly  a surprising twist from the other 2 warlock movies which is good but it needs work a whole lot of it , looking for a B movie  then this is for you however if your looking for a good witch movie you might want to check else where",1013644800,,282,3.8448275862068964
7913803,2,B00000JYLV,"Ok, I thought I would give this movie a chance considering that the first 2 films were classics, After watching the movie I had mixed feelings about it. I thought that Bruce Payne made a pretty good warlock( but cant hold a candle to sands performance)I also liked the plot of the movie, but I DIDNT like the way that they played it out. I mean the plot is still pretty good, but all the kinky sex in the movie sorta gets in the way. And its so Damn slow through the first 45 minutes that you almost fall asleep. When it does finally start picking up, the special effects are all cheap and very low budget ( probably why it didn't get a theatrical release). The gore factor is pretty high with scenees like: throat ripping and a guy hanging from hooks( very hellraiserish). So what we have is a movie that has a great potential, but still falls flat on its face with a slow script and some very cheap speacial effects.  Rated R for: a scene of graphic violence, some strong sexual content and language",989280000,9,1001,4.324468085106383
7913804,4,B00000JYLV,"Finally a genre film that breaks the rules and holds up as a film in it's own right.  A deliberate pacing gives the film an insideous evil quality that stands out from the pack (Thanks to director Eric Fraser and Bruce  Payne).  I loved the kids (even the ones who deserved to die!) and the  photography.  This is probably the last in the Warlock series, but all good  things must come to an end (and some evil ones!).",947462400,,418,4.294871794871795
7913805,3,B00000JYLV,"Just got done watching Warlock 3. I can't say that it was a work of art by any means, but it was decent. It had an awesome soundtrack to it!  Bruce Payne's performance as the Warlock was pretty good...it is kind of hard to  decide who was the best between him and Julian Sands. I'd say its about  equal. Ashley Laurence does well too...she's a pretty lady. Over all I  would give this movie about three stars...it wasn't great, but it was good.  I reccomend it if your a fan of the warlock series.",943142400,,497,4.24468085106383
