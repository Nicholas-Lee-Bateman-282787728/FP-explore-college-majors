1067501,4,630575246X,"Out of the pretty but thematically shallow world of shoujo anime such as  Sailor Moon, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Fushigi Yugi (if you've spent even  one moment arguing over which of those series is the ""best"" then  you be loser) arrises a show with an actual brain in it's head.  Beautiful  symbolism utilizing colors, ordinary objects, or roses coupled with genuine  mystery and clever scripting makes for delicious brain candy.  I don't  think those roses covering the duelists was censorship.  There's also  plenty of eccentric plot devices, bizarre chacters, and a general air of  ""why not?"" wierdness (all of which should be familiar to Sailor  Moon fans.) Unfortunately, after the 8th episode, the plot quickly becomes  formulaic and predictable, and makes a previously intriging character  completely 2-dimensional by rendering him Just Plain Evil.  Plus it shifts  the focus onto Utena herself, who isn't nearly as interesting as the  Student Council members or Anthy.
And for Gourd's sake, will you stop  comparing Tenjou Utena to Tsukino Usagi a.k.a. Sailor Moon?  The whole  point of Usagi's character was that she was an idiot savant.  She could  save the entire universe from utter anhiliation without breaking a sweat,  yet couldn't take two steps in the day-to-day world without tripping  herself.  Utena is just sorta... non-descript.",968284800,,1351,5.259433962264151
1067502,5,630575246X,"...Utena_ is a fantastic, symbolic, and serious anime that is NOT targeted at girls who have just outgrown  Sailor Moon.  Please, know the WHOLE series before you make sweeping  generalizations about it.
First off, this is one of my all-time favorie  anime series; it is NOT a typical shoujo anime by any stretch of the  imagination.  It does not, for example, revolve around a bubble-headed girl  whose primary talents are crying and eating.
Second, it is EXTREMELY  dark.  Starts out just sort of cheerful and pink, but, boy, the places it  goes.
Finally, while it's not explicit sexually (yet), it deals with some  very twisted people and some subjects which most people wouldn't be real  happy with their little four-year-olds watching--incest, for example.  Domestic violence for another.  And animal abuse.  Boy, would the SPCA have  a field day with this one.
_Utena_ is a fascinatingly beautiful  ANTI-fairy tale.  Sailor Moon is just a fairy tale.  My only objection to  this DVD is those obnoxious hard subtitles over the songs in the battle  scenes, which you unfortunately can't turn off.",967766400,5,1100,5.033519553072626
1067503,4,630575246X,"I purchased and just finished watching The Rose Collection 1 and 2.  Overall, it's good Anime, but geared to kids outgrowing Sailor moon.  Some  observations:
1. The series does NOT appear to end at the Rose Collection  2.  I haven't seen an announcement for the volume 3 anywhere.
2. Be ready  to use the fast forward button on your DVD a lot.  There are certain scenes  that are used again and again in every episode. Admittedly, they seem to be  there to establish continuity in the series because most people don't get  to watch the episodes back to back.  But, if you are watching it back to  back like you will be in DVD format, it gets tiresome very quickly because  the sections are long (about 4 minutes).
3. As has already been said,  Utena stands in relief against the world of bubbleheaded women in Anime  because of her complexity.  That says two things: (i) the vast majority of  Anime females are portrayed as being very shallow, and (ii) Utena stands  out in that crowd.  This is not to say that Utena is Holly Golightly or  anything, but she is refreshingly spicy against the saccharine of sailor  moon.
4. There were no explicit scenes in the collections, so it would be  appropriate for children to watch.  The strange lyrics used in the music  have ominous overtones, but are strung together in seemingly random  patterns.  As such, they do not seem to me to represent anything but the  setting of foreboding (e.g., in one of the often repeated songs there is a  sequence of ominous sounding historical species enumerated like  ""Ammonite"", etc.).
5. As always, it's disappointing to get a  DVD that plays in two channel stereo only.  This one isn't for showing off  your home theater system.",962323200,,1711,4.656565656565657
1067504,5,630575246X,"Utena is very cool, but is also a little confusing.  It uses a lot of complex symbolism and metaphors.  It also doesn't make sense if you don't see it from start to finish.  This is the last one that they have released.  There are actually 39 episodes.  Aside from that, the art is great, and  the storyline swells about the 8th episode.",954633600,4,337,4.354838709677419
1067505,2,630575246X,"I don't know if anyone else has encountered this, but this DVD will not play on my JVC 501BK DVD player.  The player's a region 1 player, but the DVD is labelled ""ALL"".  It *should* play okay...but won't play at  all.  Utena Volume 1 (and dozens of other DVDs) work just fine.  I know the  DVD can't be entirely busted because it DOES play on my Apple  PowerBook.
As you might expect, I'm not too thrilled about this.  However, as usual actual the Utena story is wonderful...I just wish I could  watch it on my TV!  I just wanted to mention this in case anyone else had  this DVD player...or a similar JVC model.",954374400,4,612,4.280701754385965
1067506,5,630575246X,"Like its predecessor this is another fantastic DVD from CPM. It contains the final 6 episodes of the 'Student Council Saga' being the first season of this brillant shoujo anime series. The last episode is in fact a summary  of the previous ones with little plot wrapped around it, but definitely an  appetizer for things to come. The disc starts off with the most hilarious  episode of the first season (I only say: Elephants!). However, after this  one things start to become darker when more of the characters' pasts are  revealed in some very moody flashbacks within the next episodes. This gets  almost frighteningly intense when we gain some insights in the psyche of  Nanami (student council presidents sister) in episode 3 which I found to be  the best one yet. For any serious  fan  of anime this show is a no-brainer.  UTENA has all of animes cliches turned into strengths. It is a wild mixture  of slapsick, drama, romance and action with a soundtrack that is just  gorgeous. If you do not completely hate magical girl/shoujo style anime  then give it a try, you'll surely get hooked.",954288000,8,1094,4.75
1067507,5,630575246X,"To date, there are few anime series that even compare to Utena. The storylines are intriguing and deep, the imagery facinating. It is impossible to watch any volume of this series once and be able to say you'd  actually seen it. There's something new to see every viewing! As for this  volume, the charachters develop much more fully and the duels are just  awesome! It's a Must See!",954201600,,383,4.602941176470588

Having seen all 39 episodes, plus the movie and the musical, I would have to say this DVD is  a highlight of the Utena universe.  I simply adore episodes 8-10, it ranking the highest after the ohtori akio and apocalypse sagas, and the movie, of course.  In a word, this collection is fantastic.  You won't be disapppointed with this series.  If the characters, storyline, and animation won't keep you entertained, it's massive amounts of symbolism will.  The shadowgirls will keep you guessing!  And the dueling songs only grow more enticing along with the series.  With it's intricate characters and their relationships, it's bizarre and beautiful way of weaving a story through awesome visuals, this series is definitely a winner.  I sure hope CPM releases the remaining 3 sagas soon!  All hail Touga Kiryuu!  Bow down to the master of blue monkeys!  ::CHU CHU!!!::",994636800,,955,5.006369426751593

A fair warning on the dubbed version: the voices are flat in areas and they tried to mix in a bunch of American jokes to dumb down the culture shock. All in all an EXCELLENT show. Buy it. Watch it.

1067616,5,630575246X,"I've seen all of season 1 and the Black Rose Saga, and I am so impatient to see the ending of this series.  Revolutionary Girl Utena, in a sentence, is a fairy-tale gone wonderfully awry.
The whole series is weird, vivid, mysterious, artsy, and strangely dark.  Truthfully, it's very difficult to tell exactly what the heck is REALLY going on as the series progresses, and the characters' personalities can be SO bizarre and conniving, it's unbelievable. Nanami, I loathe you.......
The animation is quite unique and beautiful to look at.  VERY sharp, angular, and colorful, and I quite enjoy the costume and hair design, in particular.
This series has magic, conspiracy, rivalry, envy, swordfights, mystery, and a whole lotta face slappin' goin' on.  It's not to be missed--Utena is a completely unique, incredible, intriguing anime, and it presents the viewer with a vision never before seen, and perhaps never to be seen again.  An online review such as this cannot really do justice to the sheer complexity, nuance, grace, and beauty of this fantastical work.",993859200,,1063,5.051428571428572
1067617,5,630575246X,"This second disc of the Shoujo Kakumei Utena series is equally as fantastic as the first.  In this collection, some questions asked in the first are answered, and a ton more are asked.  Prepare yourself for this collection, where we learn much about Utena's history and the strength she possesses, as well as the cold she must endure sometimes.
There are more dark moments in this collection, then the first :cough cough: Nanami, Saionji: cough cough:, but they all help to set the story.  Before the last episode on the disc, you may think that you have Utena and Anthy finally figured out, but don't count on it!  The final episode opens up a whole new dimension for the both of them, thanks to the mysterious Akio Ohtori, and his designs for the Prince!
If you want to see a truly unique anime, which avoids many of the usual anime clichs, definitely check out Utena.  Once again, sub only!  For the revolution of the world!",992390400,3,927,4.587878787878788
1067618,5,630575246X,"Although some of the fans who watched the first DVD Volume may have felt a little overwhelmed or confused to the point of not giving the series as much credit as it deserves, the second volume will definitly charm you!
These episodes move at a much faster speed, and the viewer feels much more at home with the characters and the storyline. Utena has a feel about it that takes getting used to before you can freely enjoy the series.
In this second volume I promise you will be laughing, crying, and just plain enjoying. They open off with one of the funniest (and weirdest ^_-) episodes, and keep heading off the deep end.
As we get more and more involved in the plot it seems everything might be spinning out of control! Connections between characters everywhere, and hidden lives that are finally coming to light.
Just when you think it can't get any more complicated everything fits together beautifully in the final episodes of the Student Council Saga.
Fans are already on the edge of their seats awaiting the Black Rose saga, and following the Ohtori Academy saga.  Plus the release of the Utena movie (which pushes the boundries even more as you enter Utena's dreamworld)

The story gets rolling in these final six episodes of the Student Council Saga, and there is a recap episode with hints of what's to come in the following Black Rose Saga due out next year.  These episodes contain much more humor and action that will draw you in and leave you wanting more.  In this volume, more of Touga, Utena, Saionji, and Nanami's pasts are revealed.  Conflict arises when Anthy is kidnapped, a new Duelist is chosen, Utena thinks she may have found her prince, and when Utena loses a part of herself.  A superb anime that will only get better, with a remaining 26 episodes.  The dub voices are still annoying, so I suggest the Japanese subtitled version.",984268800,,730,4.534351145038168
1067620,4,630575246X,"After reading all of the preceeding reviews, I was surprised to find that Sailor Moon and even Fushigi Yugi come up.  What animes HAVE they been watching?
Any way, Utena is abstract, it is dark, it is interesting. It's also not complicated (abstract does not equate to complicated, nor intellectual.  Look at X/1999 to get that one).
Now, I'm a Moonie, which is why someone lent me this series.  I also love Fushigi Yugi. But Utena is darker than Sailor Moon and has this irritating repetation with the duels.  Not the duels themselves, but the lead up (Can we say BAD music?) is just tedious.  The music in general for this series is one of the most offputting aspects of it.
Otherwise, the characters are fun, the reasons why Utena wants to be a prince is interesting and the female characters are great.  I liked most of them for their spirit and the fact that the writer gave each and everyone of them a dark aspect.  That's pretty impressive for shojo.",979084800,,957,4.56140350877193
1067621,5,630575246X,"Having only heard of Utena, I decided to check it out. The first dvd (rose collection 1) got me hooked. And this dvd is even better. It's a rather complex plot and very interesting character development throughout the episodes. One episode you see a silly Nanami character and a few episodes later you get insight into her psyche that would make any sane person steer clear of this disturbed girl.
One minute you're laughing the next you're rather sad and sympathetic to all the characters including Utena Tenjou herself. Get all the dvds to this one. It's worth the money.
I can't wait until the rest of them come out because dangit I wank to know what happens next!",975283200,,667,4.61344537815126
1067622,5,630575246X,"This is the second Utena DVD, containing 6 episodes (for a total of 13 episodes available in the US, with 26 more not translated as of November, 2000).  If you haven't seen the first DVD, don't start here--it won't make the slightest bit of sense.  If you have seen it, you know this is a strange, surreal, series.  The qualities of the first volume remain here: interesting characters, mysteries, and some hilarity at Nanami's expense.  The shadowplay girls have some particularly odd bits in these episodes, too.  (Again, if you haven't seen it, this won't make any sense!)  In general, Nanami has a stronger presence in these 6 episodes than she did in the first 7; if you like what she brings to the show, you should like this set.  Utena's friend Wakaba also shines in episode 12.  Although this brings the story only to episode 13 out of 39, the initial plot involving the Student Council, and in particular, Touga's machinations, is largely resolved here.  There is some closure to the story, but episode 13, which is unfortunately a clips episode constructed largely out of the duels in the first 12 episodes, presents new mysteries.",974246400,4,1141,4.780612244897959

7894135,5,630575246X,"More of the same, but on a greater scale.  After a fun filler episode where Utena and Anthy switch bodies, we're introduced to some downright weird but ultimately mystifying episodes tying together the pasts of Saionji, Touga and Utena.  Nanami's insane personality takes a bit more sinister turn, and Touga, after possibly proving himself to be a ""prince,"" turns into a master planner.  After Utena falls for his trap, she is forced to re-examine her life.

Not only does Rose Collection 2 keep you glued to your seat (I watched the whole DVD in a day wheras I spread out the first one), but it also works as a great set-up for the second season.

7894136,1,630575246X,"This DVD needs to be rated with a negative number.  While there are certainly some entertaining
and beautiful sequences, the vast, overwhelming majority of this series is almost indescribable.
This is a disturbing series set in a dream, fantasy atmosphere with a complicated, chaotic, and
pointless plot.
While it is true that I have not seen the first rose collection, I am confident that this series is not
supposed to make sense.  The Sailor Moon series is far superior in every way, except for some
of the artistic sequences (much of which make no sense, are repeated over and over, or are
more aggravating rather than necessary for the story line).
A note on the characters, essentially there are no real characters except for Utena.  All of the
others are shadowy, shallow and most certainly in some kind of daze.  At least all of the
characters, including Utena, have some kind of heavy mental defect which makes them appear
more alive, albeit disturbing.
There is nothing real to grab on to in these stories.  It's impossible to identify with the characters
or to tie any thing in the stories to the real world.  On most levels, the school appears to be
completely in a fantasy dream world, but in one story, they go across our earth in search of
magic spice.
The first story is the best.  The animation is poor, the editing is the worst I have seen, but it does
have insane elephants trying to stop the Sailor Geeks from reaching their magic spice, which
they are obsessed with finding to the point of risking their lives for no apparent reason.  That part
was pretty funny and completely out of step with the rest of the series.  It is very hard to
appreciate this due to the very choppy, nasty editing though.
All of the characters are very self-centered, except possibly for the Rose Bride.  It is hard to
describe how psychotic they all are.  The Rose Bride seems to be merely the sword sheath
brought to life and has the personality of a flower.  Its purpose (as gender in this series is often
undefined, bent, smashed, blurred, etc) is to be totally mentally controlled by its owner.  This
might be for good or evil, or for a bride or a friend, or to simply take sword wacks.  The songs are
chaotic, disturbing, sometimes pretty evil, and certainly ominous.
Although I am sure some might think that these stories have serious lesbian overtones, it
appears that Utena is not really a lesbian, but is instead demented, and thinks she can be a real
prince.  Towards the end, when this illusion is shattered, she gets confused, depressed, and I
think it's pretty clear that she decides that it is better to be a lesbian than a woman.  Why did the
series feel it necessary to do that?
Some say that this series supports woman empowerment, but to me it just says that if you are a
woman, you are not as good as a man, so if you don't like it, be your own man.  Is that woman
empowerment?
At the end we have a kind of revue of what is going on.  Utena appears to be a tool in the conflict
of opposing sides (everything set against everything else).  The dream world that they are in is a
type of hell trying to break through at the end the world to become the Apocalypse.  In the
Apocalypse, evil will be defeated by good, and this appears to be the evil side living in an
insane, fearful dream world.  This point is religiously repeated over and over again and sung in
songs as if they were the hymns of hell (literally).  Of course this is a confused series, so it was
the pretty part of hell maybe...if that makes any sense!
My daughter, who is 14 thought it was very weird, strange, and even though she is an A student,
she could not figure it out.  She lost all interest even though she loves cartoons and anime.  I am
so glad that I decided to watch it with her, as I think it was necessary to explain and I believe that
this series is dangerous to a young mind (which I did not know at first).  If she had been
interested in it, I would have quickly not allowed her to watch the rest.  As it turned out, I would
not be able to force her to watch it.
Overall I would have to say that the series is confused, and very much like a pretty, but very
poisonous cake, without a reason or a point.  This is for a mature audience, but is obviously
geared to young women.  I cannot imagine any of the women I know, or who I have ever known,
liking these stories and letting their daughters watch it.  I used to know of some guys who like this
type of anime and they scare me.
Amazon has much better anime to buy.  If you like gender bending, get Ranma 1/2, if you like
fluff, get Sailor Moon, if you like action get Dragonball, if you like warm characters with crazy
ones, get Maison Ikkoku or Tenchi.",1072742400,5,4706,4.363532110091743

7894139,5,630575246X,"Shoujo Kakumei Utena, known in the United States as Revolutionary Girl Utena, is probably the next logical step for those who have outgrown Sailormoon, Dragonball, or any of the other mass-hyped dubbed anime. Not to say that these aren't quality shows, I enjoy Sailormoon myself. However..
  Utena blurs the lines of friendship, trust, admiration, jealousy, hate, revenge, control, power, and lust all into one giant blender and then hits puree. The second volume (and the most recent release of the series to date, not counting the FREAKISH parallel-world movie), delves a little deeper into the mysterious world of the exclusive Ohtori Academy.  We learn just how possesive Kiryuu Nanmi is..a little more about the recurring theme of the Prince and the origin of Utena's rose signet, and we get a sense of the things to come..
  The visuals are, as usual in Utena, superb..from flashbacks of Nanami as a little girl, to the shadowy young Utena in a coffin...and the duels become a little more dramatic, especially the final duels of the disc.
  The music is, as usual, repetitive, but with beautiful themes like Scarlet of the Campus(Utena's Theme) and The Sunlit Garden, who can complain? I must admit, however, even I find myself fast forwarding through Absolute Destiny Apocalypse, Truth, and Revolution (though if they ever release it stateside..you will NOT find yourself doing it after episode 25...) The duel choruses, if you think about them, probe deeply into the nature of each character..Last Evolution speaks of Nanami's belief in her destiny beside her brother, while No One Has Anything to Tell calls upon the mystery of the Rose Bride and the power of Utena's will...these choruses are meaningful music that is often overlooked.
  The main character development, as it probably should be for a show entiled 'Utena' centers around the main character, though we see a little deeper into the Kiryuu family in this disc. Curried High Trip is the comedic episode of the disc, and as in Be Careful, Nanami-sama, Miss Kiryuu seems to take the brunt of punishment. The cheerful Wakaba makes another grand appearance.
  In all, the series is reccomended for teenagers and adults..this is definitely not a children's show due to it's complex nature. Trust me, the first two discs only scratch the surface of Utena's complexity.. to really understand the metaphors and symbolism in the duel choruses alone takes quite a bit of thinking. Just ""three of the seven Ancient wonders""?
  Definitely reccomended for those who have seen the first seven episodes.",1015804800,5,2560,5.081145584725537
7894140,5,630575246X,"This is the second of two DVD's in the collection. The first DVD was good. This is brilliant. To start with, Revolutionary Girl Utena has some of the greatest characterization that I've seen in any anime. Each character is powerfully sculpted through their past experiences, actions and emotions. You really care about them.
The plot is good if not great, and the characters really bring it to life. The dueling scenes are also pretty well done, and as usual the show's music is top notch.
While Utena is still light-hearted and humorous in places, some of these episodes take on a darker tone, and a few are bitterly tragic. (though extremely well done) One of the things I love about this show is that it seems to cover the whole range of human emotion.
The DVD is also well done, with fine picture quality and some worthwhile extra features. I like the Japanese voice acting, but if you prefer dubbed, Utena has good English voice acting as well.
On a final note, if you're interested in this then you've probably seen the first DVD (as you should) but I still ought to mention that if the word shojo turns you off because you associate it with shows like Sailor Moon, you still should try this. Revolutionary Girl Utena couldn't be more different, and while it was marketed toward girls, it can really be enjoyed by anyone. Bottom line, this is an excellent anime that is definitely worth your time and money.",1015200000,,1413,4.633466135458168
