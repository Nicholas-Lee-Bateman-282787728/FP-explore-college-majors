8669283,1,B0055NZ6BK,"This dvd goes over the sample test questions on the west-e web site.
Some of the explanations are helpful, just as many are not, often incomprehensible. The man doing the dvd makes leaps, apparently using formulas or theorems that he doesn't name or mention. I've shown the video to other math friends, one of whom thought it was a parody, others who also didn't find explanations for the questions I had problems with helpful.
Technically, the sound often cuts out or skips and on some problems makes understanding even harder. Also, the dvd is not indexed by question, so finding individual questions is quite difficult. Both of those are easy to do.
There is very little help available for this test, so someone might find the dvd helpful, but it wasn't for me. I think hiring a good math tutor to help you go over the contents of the sample test would be more helpful, and probably cheaper.",1333843200,,894,4.6645569620253164
