7479603,5,B016QHDGPG,"A brutally honest and extremely educational documentary on the chemsex epidemic that is plaguing London, and unfortunately making some waves in the U.S. This documentary tells the stories of individuals lives over the span and a full year, and gives you an up-close experience to what some of the most active addicts in the scene are going through in their darkest moments. It explains how many men fall into the scene, the psychology behind it, and how some fortunately make their way out. Thank you William Fairman, Max Gogarty and the team at Vice for turning around an important documentary so quickly. I hope David Stuart's work at 56 Dean Street to help combat this epidemic in London and internationally continues to grow and succeed.",1481155200,4,741,4.936

8737122,3,B016QHDGPG,"Half a movie, while the film maker gets excellent honest responses from the users the most interesting question is ignored ..how a gay man who finds himself an addict with his drug use tied to his sex life finds recovery. There is a brief epilogue in txt telling who got clean but their method be it a twelve step or one on one counseling is Ott out and it leaves the film feeling incomplete. David a former addict who runs the London counting center appears to have his own method but its never really discussed. The sessions we see with a patient he allows that the patient can continue to drink alcohol yet everytime he does he uses drugs again, which is why most addicts in recovery are advised to identify as alcoholics as well, even if booze was not their first drug of choice, but that is not discussed. The filmmaker does make the weekend long meth and sex parties appear hellish but not sure that is enough of a message in a film that appears to be trying to help with a very real epidemic among gay men.",1531008000,,1013,4.336842105263158

8737124,5,B016QHDGPG,"I watched this get some insight on the topic. Some young gay men I know are in this cycle. One was raped. He continues to participate. I have seen extreme bouts of depression, anxiety, and paranoid behavior. He also has found out he is h.i.v. positive. One would think that would make one stop. It is heartbreaking to watch these men. Watching this I was able to understand the scope of the issue much better than the conclusions I had come to on my own. Realizing how everything is a click away, how easy it is to jump back into it in a moment of loneliness. I found it compelling.  Though difficult  to watch, I recommend this film to anyone who is touched by its subject matter.",1511049600,,681,4.354330708661418

8737126,2,B016QHDGPG,"""Chemsex"" is all shock & awe. This documentary that deals with a serious topic makes it appear that ""party & play"" is the new gay ""norm,"" so there is no urgency to deal with this systemic problem.

This 80-minute, underdeveloped ""expose"" offers no concrete solutions for meth addiction including treatment centers, counseling, prescribing Naltrexone, or peer support.",1485561600,2,367,5.43859649122807
