2429476,2,B000BNKB0U,"I am disappointed with this dvd. It calls itself an exercis dvd for over 50, then proceeds to show two women in already great shape, neither of which looks close to 50. I can and have done all the movements in the dvd on my own and find them so boring I can't keep it up.

The overall quality of the disc is very good, but the person who apparently is doing the easier movements is hidden behind the other performer.  If you are in faily good shape, and not easily bored, then this would be a good investment. It just isn't what I expected.",1358985600,2,540,4.133333333333334
2429477,3,B000BNKB0U,Good for easy stretching but short! Easy on the joints. Good for starting out slow and getting muscles in shape.,1357084800,5,112,4.65
2429478,5,B000BNKB0U,"I purchased this DVD because of my age and not wanting to go to the gym to be depressed by either people who were younger and in better shape than I was in (I have no desire to be one of the ""beautiful people"") or watching people who really pushed the physical weight limitations of some of the machines. I needed a DVD that would help me gain some flexibility and would build slowly build some strength to the ""core"". This DVD did the trick.",1307491200,7,442,4.211764705882353
2429479,1,B000BNKB0U,"I wish that the person demonstrating the less demanding moves would have been more visible --

This routine did not seem much different at all from the usual routines -- I question where the ""50+"" was seriously addressed.",1278806400,,221,4.815789473684211
2429480,5,B000BNKB0U,I'm 75 so I didn't want anything too strenuous.  This is perfect for the senior.,1236816000,8,80,4.333333333333333
2429481,1,B000BNKB0U,This pilates dvd is for people over 50. I think it should have said for people over 100. There is really no workout at all here. Sorry I bought it.,1179792000,3,147,3.933333333333333
2429482,3,B000BNKB0U,Most if not all exercises were done on the floor. The only difference between the beginner and intermediate versions is the reps given to each of the exercises. I thought there should have been more exercises while standing.,1175644800,5,224,4.921052631578948
2429483,4,B000BNKB0U,"This is one of many pilates dvds I've watched.  The 20 minute one for beginners (the only one I use) is quite good.  Amy repeats important directions repeatedly and gives gentle reminder not to strain lower back or neck and to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.  This beginner set has been a very good starting point for me and she's right, I can feel my core getting stronger.  The 20 minutes go fast and  you learn what your body can do and build from there.  I would have liked a better view of the second person, the one I was following when Amy suggeted an easier version of the exercise, but you won't go wrong buying it.",1171065600,21,647,4.262295081967213
8089320,3,B000BNKB0U,"Never use due to many physical problems.
I am sure others would like it though.",1468800000,,79,4.333333333333333
8089321,3,B000BNKB0U,"Really easy Pilates moves.  If you're 50+ and you've been regularly doing Pilates, it won't do much.  If you are 50+ and you have never done Pilates, it's fine.",1455235200,,160,4.482758620689655
8089322,4,B000BNKB0U,Although both the same workouts are the same I find doing the routine about twice a week really helps my back.,1454544000,,110,4.285714285714286
8089323,3,B000BNKB0U,"Love workout, good 20 minute very worth every minute.",1445385600,,53,5.0
8089324,3,B000BNKB0U,"I am 62 years old, over weight & way out of shape because of running my own business, raising 3 kids and taking care of elderly parents for the past 20 years - never had time for myself. Well the parents died and the kids are almost out of the house so I have been trying to get back in shape. Went to an all inclusive vacation resort and tried the various activities to see what I could do. I am not going to get six pack abs with the keg I have. Pilates was something I could do without hurting myself and it felt good afterwards, in a way.. Just did some and stopped if I got too uncomfortable. This is something I could work up to do, very basic. I had to replace the disc with a new one because I thought it was defective. There are two levels listed on the disc, yet the beginners and intermediate are exactly the same. The replacement was the same. So if it had been what it said I would have kept it, I needed something more to work up to. Will try another disc of hers.",1423612800,4,978,3.9948979591836733
8089325,5,B000BNKB0U,I like this program,1417132800,,19,4.0

8089327,5,B000BNKB0U,"I love Pilates for 50 +, I recently started an exercise class at my job and the ladies just love it.
We have four - six ladies three times a week.",1407801600,,146,3.7419354838709675
8089328,1,B000BNKB0U,"I have arthritis in my legs....and all this DVD is everything down on the floor including yourself! So was very disappointed in it. Now this is the first DVD I have ever purchased for Pilates, so did not know much about them.",1397088000,,225,4.380952380952381
8089329,5,B000BNKB0U,"My situation:  out of shape Pilates beginner with a busy life and a really weak abdominal core. I don't have time for more than 20 minutes in the morning. I have been exercising with this video 3 times a week and always feel that I have gotten a great abdominal work out. More importantly, my core is getting stronger which is reflected in my posture and stride. I expect to be able to move on to more challenging videos soon.",1370044800,10,426,4.325
