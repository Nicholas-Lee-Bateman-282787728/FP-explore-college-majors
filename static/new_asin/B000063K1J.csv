1691105,5,B000063K1J,"""Solarmax"" is a model of what scientific documentary should be: informative without being patronizing; visually spectacular without being a CGI blast-a-minute face slapper.  Whenever possible, writer/director/producer John Weiley allows the images to do all the talking.  When necessary, understated narration is inserted by the very pleasant and dignified voice of Alex Scott.

The marvelous score by Nigel Westlake (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solar-Max-Alex-Scott/dp/B000063K1J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B0000014XK ""Babe""</a>, ""Miss Potter"") runs the gamut from classically-inspired harp+glass harmonica to raucous, gut-thumping surround-sound percussion.  The music is always appropriate to the scene--never cloying and never a distraction--and manages to complement the visuals while adding a unique color all its own.  (If you have ever seen a big, explosive auroral display in person, you should find Westlake's musical evocation perfectly suited: shimmering, colorful, joyous.)

I look forward to the day when the Blu-Ray version of the film is available for the home.  Until then, this DVD is a great addition to anyone's library and worth playing for anyone who comes to visit.  As we head into another solar maximum over the next few years, too, IMAX cinemas around the world would do well to bring this film back into regular rotation.  The sun never goes out of style.",1206230400,,1424,6.08
1691106,5,B000063K1J,"I had the chance to see this movie back in 2001 at an IMAX screen. Boy...was it good. With amazing footage, beautiful photography, outstanding narration (both English and Spanish) and a sountrack that will be a feast for your ears, this IMAX movie is one of the best. Is fun, entertaining but above all filled with information. Directed to young adults and adult audiences, so you won't get childlish comments or explanations. Very well put together, you will enjoy it.",1173312000,5,469,4.875
1691107,5,B000063K1J,"Bought this on the positive Amazon reviews from others, and I now agree that the raves were right on target.  Some interesting facts on the sun and our relationship to the sun, as well as the expected beautiful photography.  Well done.",1163030400,5,235,4.7073170731707314
1691108,5,B000063K1J,"Turn off all the lights in the room. Close the blinds. Put SolarMax into the DVD player. Turn up the volume as high as it will go. In an hour, you'll be scared to go outside in the daytime.

It's the most educational action-movie in the solar system.",1141862400,6,250,4.208333333333333
1691109,5,B000063K1J,"This is an awe-inspiring film in the literal sense: it starts out by advising the viewer that none of the scenes of the sun are computer-generated -- they are all actual photographs -- and awesome they are.  It is hard to wrap one's mind around the magnitude of these solar events.  The explanations of how solar storms impact our planet, and the discussion of how earlier cultures understood and worshipped the sun are fascinating, but the killer images of the aurora borealis, Machu Picchu, and the sun itself are what make this film a must-see.",1103155200,37,547,4.747368421052632

7959536,5,B000063K1J,"I first viewed this film back when it was released into IMAX theaters back in 2001. In all honesty it was and still is my single favorite IMAX film. It was simply breathtaking watching this on an IMAX screen as I had never seen the sun in such detail before. I have always been a huge Astronomy junkie as I was introduced to the subject at a very young age by my father who was also a huge astronomy fan. He always had the cutting edge telescopes that let us view everything from the the moon to the planets and even distant galaxies and nebula. The one thing that just seemed to slip by was our own Sun. This is most likely because we didn't have the types of telescopes that allowed us to view the sun. Hence it just wasn't one of the things that we focused on and that stayed with me all the way up to the day I viewed this film. Then it all changed.

I walked out of the theater so awe struck by what I had just seen that I immediately went home and started looking into acquiring my own solar telescope. I wanted to be able to see the sun, in real time, like I had just seen it on the big IMAX screen. To make a long story short, 6 months and over 200 eBay sales later I finally ordered my own solar telescope. Its kind of ironic that the solar telescope that I wound up purchasing had the same name as this film, The double stacked Solarmax 90 from Coronado. It was VERY expensive but it was worth every penny. The first time I was able to set up my solarmax and view the sun with my own eyes, well lets just say it was one of the most memorable moments in my life. I sat there for hours literally mesmerized by the beauty. My interest in the sun has only grown over time and I now focus most of my time photographing the sun. Its just an amazing side to both photography and astronomy and I owe it all to seeing Solarmax in the theater that day. Funny how things work out sometimes.

Anyways if you haven't seen this film and have even a little bit of interest in astronomy then this film should be put on the very top of your to see list. Not only does it give you amazing images of the sun, it also gives you a very interesting historical look at the sun and the effect that it had on different cultures in the world. One of the most fascinating parts of the film is when it shows you the oldest building still standing. Its basically a building that houses a sun room and the interesting part is that for only 1 day a year the back ""Sun room"" is illuminated. The other 364 days of the year, the sun isn't at the proper angle for sunlight to enter this room. The IMAX camera's capture this extremely fascinating event in great detail.

The good news is that Magic Play Entertainment is currently working on the remastered 1080p Blu Ray version which was taken directly from the original 65mm film. Trust me when I say that this is the one IMAX film that you simply must see in HD.

The Bottom line - This is easily one of the best IMAX films ever produced and I recommend it as much for children as I do for adults. This film inspired me to the point where Solar Viewing is now a daily part of my life. It may just have the same effect on you.

5 Stars! Absolutely Brilliant!!",1258156800,,3185,4.114147909967846

7959538,5,B000063K1J,"Solar Max (IMAX Large Format) (2000) was a fine five star addition to the many space specials produced in IMAX.  This one presented spectacular color images of the Suns carona, solar wind, and magnetic field (and interactions with that of the Earth) as recorded by the many special purpose solar observatory satellites.  In addition, very beautiful footage recorded at several locations around the world provided some human interest from the ground level.",1245974400,,455,5.305555555555555
7959539,4,B000063K1J,"This film is only for people who prefer to view visually stunning images and video, or for scientifically curious people, or for people who could be called ""sun worshippers"", or people who love to be awe-inspired. Anyone else left should not get this DVD.",1234396800,,255,4.818181818181818
7959540,5,B000063K1J,A must show to any Earth Science class studying the Sun and solar activity. Great narration takes the viewer from ancient civilizations to modern day satellites and how dynamic the Sun really is.  Aligns to CA Earth Science High School standards.,1215475200,,246,5.0
7959541,3,B000063K1J,"This film was very dissapointing and not at all what I expected.

There were only a few glimpses of the Sun and not enough explanation about its properties: how it generates nuclear fusion; how and why the Sun shines; its position on the HR diagram/comparison to other stars; apparent brightness, etc. I thought this would be a great film to summarize information on the Sun for my descriptive astronomy class.

Don't bother wasting your money.  I am not impressed!",1211673600,,465,4.860759493670886
7959542,3,B000063K1J,"I can't believe this program received eight five star reviews.  I guess it depends on what your interested in.  This film is good if your looking for a history of the sun: sun worship, space probes, old theories on the aurora borealis, sun spots(which they never explain) etc.  The film is very poor if your interested in the science behind the sun.  This video talks nothing about the composition of the sun or the processes that go on inside it.  It says little or nothing about coronal mass ejections or how they work.  It also doesn't explain anything about the magnetic field or why there is a ""Solarmax"" every 11 years.(The answer has to do with its twisted magnetic field, which they never touch on)
""The Universe"" series has a much, much, much better program on the sun called ""Secrets of the Sun"", not only do they explain the science better but they have much better images.
One more thing, this program only really has one visual of the sun, there are not many visuals as you are lead to believe.  The only reason I am not giving it a 1 or 2 is because I am guessing this film was made before much of the knowledge we have now was discovered, but if it was these filmmakers should be ashamed and I guessing these people were slackers and just wanted to get the project done.",1206748800,3,1285,4.419491525423729
