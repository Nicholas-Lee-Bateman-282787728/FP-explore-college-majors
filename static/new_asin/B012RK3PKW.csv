8726482,4,B012RK3PKW,"Nice time pass, with a focus on issues that are commonly seen in India, puts religion in focus with some light comedy. Nice overview of different religions and how they are differemt but essentially same. Presh Rawal as usual is at his best, Annu Kappor is great too. N. Shah has limited role. Overall a good time pass for some laughs.",1482624000,,335,4.508196721311475

8726486,3,B012RK3PKW,Had high expectations after OMG! This one is not even close. The plot was good at the start but gets meddled in the middle,1463184000,,122,4.125
8726487,5,B012RK3PKW,"A very good movie from beginning to end. You see  how religion is powerful enough
to seperate the human race including your
own family. And how people see your religion before they see YOU. Great message in this movie. It's awesome how they placed Gippy Grewal's part in this as well as his great songs!",1455753600,,303,4.509090909090909
8726488,5,B012RK3PKW,"In spite of the religious zealots' ire in India this movie is for all true believers and the pure at heart.  Magnificiently acted, a hilarious take on mankind's attitude towards faith, and its many manifestations in practice.  When after a lifetime practicing one religion, the protagonist suddenly finds he was born into another one to a very pious father, and put up for adoption by a corrupt relative.  Watch especially the confrontation scene of Paresh Rawal with his wife who has spied on his secret nightly absences from the conjugal bed. A masterpiece of comedic dialogue!",1449014400,,579,5.010416666666667
