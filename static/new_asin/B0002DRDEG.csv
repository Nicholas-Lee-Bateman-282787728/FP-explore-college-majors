8026877,4,B0002DRDEG,"This DVD is exactly what the packaging says it is--22 minutes of the Cowboys 2003 season. It certainly would be nice for a longer program, but for under $10 it's hard to go wrong.

The picture quality is excellent and the DVD concentrates on the highlights of the season. The games in which the Cowboys lost are glossed over with little if any footage from them.

I'm not sure, but I think this might be a NFL Network program, as some of the graphics are similar to that used by the NFL network, and the 22-minutes running time is about right for a half-hour show with commercials.",1091923200,2,581,4.420560747663552
8026878,1,B0002DRDEG,"don't waste your money. i am a huge cowboy fan and when i saw this in the store i bought it without hesitation. i couldn't wait to get home and watch a recap of one of the best season they have had in a long time. well the whole dvd is 22 minutes long. take out the extra stuff and they spend less than a minute a game. i was so disappointed. maybe in the future the nfl will get it right and release whole seasons on dvd, but for now it is not worth the $9.",1091923200,6,458,3.731958762886598
