1448123,5,B00005JLBE,"I have been following this film closely and from what I have seen and heard, including the new song by Madonna, this film is looking to bring a fresh page to the 007 film saga. The story is probably the best of the Brosnan's so far. You have to see this film, not because it's another Bond flick, but because it's the 20th film on the 40th anniversary of the film series. Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me were landmark Bond films and Die Another Day is looking to follow in their footsteps.",1033171200,7,493,4.25531914893617
1448124,5,B00005JLBE,"The theme song just premiered on z100, and it's such a funy infectious song.  I never was into James Bond, but now I am, all because I love Madonna, and I love ""Die Another Day"" (the song), and the fact she is making a cameo is actually going to get me to the movies.  LOL- I don't even know what the movie is about, so sorry if this review isn't so helpful hehehehe!",1033171200,2,367,4.013698630136986
1448125,4,B00005JLBE,"After the overly-glossy The World is Not Enough, Pierce Brosnan returns as the suave british secret agent 007 in the newest Bond flick, appropriatly titled Die Another Day. Directed by Lee Tamahori (The Edge, Along came a Spider), Bond no. 20 will no doubt be another action-filled entry into the long-running franchise. But will it match the excellent heights of Goldeneye? One hopes so. From what i've seen of the preveiws, the action looks impressive, with explosions aplenty, but as many people in Hollywood have learned the hard way, noisy things exploding and fast action does not a good movie make. But it's a Bond film, and Tamahori has proven to be a director who can do action well, so events should be good...",1025481600,6,720,4.814516129032258

1448209,5,B00005JLBE,"An especially fun adventure in the James Bond catalog.

The Pros:

 A great start to the movie that was startling on first viewing of Bond being captured and abandoned and tortured. This story took us to a couple of places we weren't used to going in a Bond film.
 The North Korean setting and villainy is certainly not without precedent and is relevant today. Fortunately for us Kim Jong Un is not as suave as smarmy Gustav Graves.
 Fast-paced with tons of action, be it gun play or ridiculous weapons use (how does Bond just know how to work everything just right and throw the right switches?), and frequent hand-to-hand. The sword fight sequence between Bond and Graves is like a testosterone brawl that starts off semi-civilly before descending into an out-and-out hack-and-slash battle.
 Stunning set pieces like the nouveau ice castle and great filming locations.
 The diamond-damaged Zao may not have ultimately pulled his own weight in the film but his visage made for a memorable baddie.
 Halle Berry coming up out of the water a la Ursula Andress Honey Rider in Doctor No. Hotch-cha! Rosamund Pikes Ms. Frost was able to make her point on screen too!

The Cons:

 Could the theme song, by Madonna, possibly get any worse? Absolutely horrible!
 The chemistry between Pierce Brosnans Bond and Berrys American espionage counterpart Jinx was forced and the innuendo between the two was wincingly bad. Berry just doesnt show to be cut out for an action movie.
 The dialogue in general wasn't a strong point in this still fun entry. Director Lee Tamahori gives fans what they want with the action and visuals but it wouldnt have hurt him to have grounded the characters a bit more emotionally. Still, who usually goes to a Bond movie for grounded characters?",1512691200,,1763,4.836666666666667
1448210,3,B00005JLBE,"Bond's gadgetry has pushed the bounds of the believable for most of the franchise, but the invisible car is too much.  In general, the best Bond movies have left the gadgetry understated so that the action and adventure happen in this world.

Additionally, the CGI makes for some of the only scenes in the franchise that look truly ""dated"".  There's a bit of this in the other films of the Brosnan era, but none are so egregious as the windsurfing scene in this movie.  The reason Bond films are such classics is because they are audially and visually stunning, using physically constructed sets or filming on location.

Three stars because it's a Bond movie, and aside from some clunky 90's CGI and one gadget that's just to much, it has what a Bond film should have: car chases, beautiful women, and cheesy humor arranged on a simple structure to create an entertaining effect.",1512086400,,879,4.718954248366013
1448211,4,B00005JLBE,Perhaps the best Brosnan bond movie.  Silly invisible car.  Terrific visible Halle Berry!,1511481600,,89,5.769230769230769

1448213,3,B00005JLBE,"Halle Berry.  great action sequences,  Halle Berry.  not a horrible script.  did i mention Halle Berry?

Pierce Brosnan is a great actor, but just doesn't have the grittiness the character needs; he beats Roger Moore hollow (well, duh), but is just not in the same league as Daniel Craig or Sean Connery, or Timothy Dalton",1511395200,,322,4.781818181818182
1448214,5,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is my favorite Bond film. Yes, I am aware of the stunningly bad CG scene involving Bond para-sailing on a non-existent ocean, but looking beyond that, there is a lot of great action in this film. Some of the best in any action film, I'd argue. There is a sword fight that is arguably the best sword fight in cinematic history, especially when considering that it feels extremely realistic. Also, I'd be remiss not to mention that easily two of the hottest Bond girls ever appear in this film, Hallie Berry and Rosamund Pike. There isn't a boring moment.",1510876800,,569,4.588235294117647

Pierce Brosnan is very suitable for the role in the few instances when imaginary technology is not squeezing him into irrelevance from all directions. The cinematic effects are spectacular and far outpace the plot. But with Halle Berry as the major female attraction, there are no sexual pyrotechnics. And famous names in supporting roles (like Judy Dench) are reduced to bland uselessness. Barely earned 3 stars by rounding up for me.",1509840000,,527,5.068965517241379

It shows he is not infallible. The scene where he walks into the hotel in his pjs and gets 5 star treatment. The new Aston Martin. The disavowed agent underground station. I had a problem with the bad girl and guy.

It's night time and so the guards cannot see James and his friends with their huge surf boards, even though they pass right by and kill a few on the way.  JB and pals run through the forest and get the diamonds which the head North Korean guy, son of Old North Korean Guy, wants to buy and that's why he had the heliocopter waiting but then James Bomb got the heliocopter but it got hit by a missile, so he had to jump out of it and run to the new improved water-glider boat.  Okay?  But the Korean diamond kid took a picture of JB on his cell phone, on the diamond kid's own cell phone, I mean, and he finds out that it is notorious British assassin, James Bomb.  JB can navigate a hover-boat while he shoots a machine gun with his other hand so it is all going well until -  Well, you get the idea.  It gets more absurd from there, so if this is the kind of crap you like, you are in for a fun wasted 2 hrs.",1485993600,2,1089,3.9406392694063928
1448464,1,B00005JLBE,"This is such an awful movie I could barely finish it. Not only is it the worst Bond film in creation, it's truly one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The plot is totally unrealistic and hallow; it's more of a sci-fi film than an action one. I was actually audibly laughing at some of the ""action sequences"" because they were so terribly exaggerated and ridiculous. The acting is horrendous and the sexual tension between Halle and Bond is painfully awkward and uncomfortable. If there was ever a movie full of terrible puns, this is the one. I am a huge fan of Pierce and was sad to see this was his final installment in the series. What a terrible way to go out. It's a shame.",1485734400,,690,4.2748091603053435

1449559,5,B00005JLBE,"Pierce Brosnan will always have a special place in my heart as James Bond. four films was not enough. He had really made the role his own, and gave me a whole new reason to love Bond films. In Die Another Day, he goes out with a bang. Love how they raise the stakes. Caught behind enemy lines, tortured, only to return home a burned asset. He has to leave everyone behind to go after the bad guys. With nothing but a 57 Chevy, revolver and a pair of binoculars. Love it!

And Brosnan's last ride is with the hottest Bond girl of all time for my money, Halle Berry. So many Bond girls of the past were beautiful but helpless, or beautiful but feckless, and of course there were the femme fatales, but ... Halle's Jinx was Bond's equal. (Yes, he did get her out of a jam, but just that one time.) She enters the scene - and leaves it - with a splash. When she beats Bond to the helicopter full of bad guys, and then escapes police with a sexy dive from an impossible height, Bond is terrified -- and impressed.

Die Another Day is a great ride, and I love the John Barry score as always. (Anyone else notice the soundtrack over that last scene in the little hut sounds a lot like Out of Africa?)  Enjoy!",1464048000,2,1201,4.168103448275862

1450032,2,B00005JLBE,"WHAT!?  The word plausible never crossed the minds of the writers. The story was soooo strained and the stars involved seemed lost half the time in a gratuitous script loaded with the lamest of sexual inuendo even for a Bond film. They even managed to obscure the natural grit of Halle Berry in a character with little to no development.

My angst started with the lunacy that allows for such technology to create a super weapon to be in the hands of people who for some reason cannot figure out how to remove diamonds from the co-villan's face!  At least they didn't start calling him ""Diamond Face"" .....but they might as well have.

1450040,3,B00005JLBE,"Even the worst James Bond movie of all time still rates 3 stars, just because the Moonraker-surpassing, over-the-top silliness is still surrounded by plenty of action scenes that are at least amusing to behold. There are scenes in here that are even more unbelievable than if you were watching a super-hero movie, but apparently they wanted to transform Bond into one, totally dispensing with any semblance of reality in the process. Brosnan was always a good Bond, but here lines are stuffed into his mouth that makes him seem like an aging, awkward twit; witness the eye-crossing conversation between old Bond and the young Jinx the first time they meet. What happened to suave? Did these words actually have any meaning? Who cares, right, here comes the action. At least in the previous title-holder for worst Bond film, Moonraker, the first half of the movie was quite a good Bond film, with exotic locations etc. to stir the imagination. In Die Another Day, although he travels the world in pursuit of the bad guys, it mostly feels rushed and stale (the exception being the fun opening sequence), with a script seemingly written overnight by an intoxicated hack writer, and set pieces surely designed for some weird Santa Claus movie. At least this laugh fest forced them to rethink the entire Bond thing.",1463184000,,1310,4.905405405405405

I'm ever more stunned by all the folks that gave it a positive review... there was very little positive entertainment to salvage from this nuclear-cheesoid of a Bond film... the exceptionally poor special effects are physically painful to watch... CGI Bond parasail-surfing a CGI tidal wave was unbelievably fake-fake-fakey... though Halle Berry diving backwards off of an five-hundred foot cliff was a very close runner-up in terms of lazy, ""who are you trying to convince"" filmmaking... followed by the hokey laser-cutter fight with ""Mr. Kill"", or the drawn-in flaming cargo plane & unconvincing helicopter free fall for the film's ""dramatic"" conclusion. Pierce Brosnan & Halle Berry can be very talented actors, but they were given a giant plate of steaming cheese in terms of dialogue... nearly every line in the film involves an unfunny pun, sexual innuendo or double-entendre, which gets very old, very fast... it was if a very untalented fanboy had written the screenplay. The main villain was laughably evil, from his glares, sneers and ludicrous exo-skeleton laser weapon, all made that much more over the top by some truly miserable acting. One ridiculous premise after another, from human DNA transfer to diamonds permanently embedding themselves into the henchman's face (a pair of tweezers could have cured him), to Madonna as a fencing master, to a hotel made of ice to an invisible car... this film was more cartoon than live action movie, from its concepts, story and uber-cheesy CGI... a James Bond coloring book would provide the same level of entertainment value!!!",1462492800,4,1710,5.154676258992806

Die Another Day however, sucked. It was overdone as much as possible. CGI, stupid plot that felt like a mocking Roger Moore movie, an invisible car, even the gun barrel was in 3D. After this, the producers said they needed a change in direction and instead of firing the writers who wrote this crap, they decided to save their arrogant asses and let Pierce Brosnan go and claimed he wasn't tough enough and he was too old.

Aside from being the 20th in the franchise, it also Pierce Bosnan's last turn as 007 and a homage to the Bond culture and films of the past. Halle Berry (Jinx Johnson) beautifully re=creates Ursula Andres' rise out of the ocean in Dr. No. John Cleese (Q) talkes over as the dodering father figure, replete with cracks at Bond. In one scene, Bond picks up the shoe worn by Lotte lenya in Fom Russia With Love, the jetpack from Thunderball and other props from previous Bond films are in the background. Finally, the villain's hideout is a throwback to Bond films of the past.  Brosnan once again plays James Bond but shows more heart in this film. The plot is a basic villain, Colonel Moon a rbegade North Korean officer (Will YunLee) now masquerading asGustav Graves (Toby Stephens) an English diamond baron through gene therapy. He wants to lead his country in a victory over the decadent west and will stop at nothing to do so. of course, bond stops him and his henchmen played by RickyYune and Lawrence Makaore while romancing the bad girl played by Rosamund Pike. This film hits all the right buttons and covers all the bases. Overall, it is a solid entry but a bit melancholy because it is Borsnan's last film as Bond.",1439078400,,1262,4.559471365638767

1450826,4,B00005JLBE,"It was so great to see another fun bond movie. They had a winning formula. It worked for years. Why did they ever part with it? What could possibly make them think that change was better? In this Bond movie you have all the crazy gadgets, fast cars, exciting transportation. You still have a humorous Q-Bond interaction with John Cleese, the double entendres, Humor was still a part of the Bond movies. There are weaknesses, the obvious CGI board escape on the glacier, wirecutters to cut through the fence after all this impossible high tech, did Bond forget his laser?  But it was still the same entertaining formula that audiences loved about James Bond for years. In spite of the increasingly dark and darker bond shows this was still a good entertaining show. Let's stress that word, entertaining.  Forget that the plot is totally improbable and one impossible thing happens after the other, it's so much fun to watch from the opening surfing scene to the very last you don't mind at all that no one could survive in this film. Now you have all the same improbable stunts, non stop action and killing and action and killing in the new Craig films and NO MORE FUN. Pierce Brosnan did a great job in this film. Still a dashing and masculine Bond. He didn't deserved to be dumped by the Broccoli team. Pierce it's our loss not to ever see you play Bond again. Brosnan is hardly the geriatric Bond of Roger Moore in his later Bond films. But they wanted something different. Judy Dench's M gets really tiresome and irritating. Not the actress's fault but rather than miserable role she is cast in. That detracts from the entertainment aspect of the film. The hard nosed nasty bitchy M is hardly endearing and it will be no loss to see this character die off in a much later Bond film. Overall a very enjoyable Bond film which leaves you feeling upbeat at the end, a formula that will be seriously missed in subsequent Bond films.",1409788800,,1930,4.591304347826087
1450827,3,B00005JLBE,"I've always felt that Pierce Brosnan was an excellent James Bond, especially after he jump started the series with ""Goldeneye,"" his first 007.  Unfortunately the producers let him down with his last two films.  This very average Bond film managed to get him unceremoniously fired.  Not that he did anything wrong.  He's still very good.

""Die Another Day"" opens with Bond and 2 associates surfing on a huge wave onto the coast of North Korea.  Bond assumes the guise of an arms dealer looking to trade a cache of ""blood"" diamonds for some neat new weapons.  One of these is a ridiculously contrived vehicle that floats on air.  All the better to avoid the thousands of land mines between North and South Korea.  Bond doesn't quite make it and is captured.  I don't recall another Bond film where he doesn't get away in the opening sequence.

After 14 months of torture and captivity he is traded for a character named Zao (Rick Yune), the right hand man of Col. Moon (Will Yun Lee) who is believed to have been killed trying to kill Bond in that opening sequence.  ""M"" (Judi Dench) is pissed off that she and the Americans had to give up Zao for Bond.  She pulls him from duty - yeah, that will work - for some unknown reason.  So Bond being Bond, improvises his escape from the Brits.  Didn't he have to do this before just a few movies ago?

Bond is still pissed at North Korea and wants to find the arms dealer that has all those diamonds.  That leads him to Iceland.  It appears that an ex-pat named Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) is the evil doer in charge.  He's even developed a giant laser that is orbiting in space.  Think back to ""Goldfinger"" but this one is much bigger and has mass destructive capabilities.  Graves's assistant is Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike, soon to be seen in ""Gone Girl"") but she's actually an agent working for ""M,"" or is she?

This film is loaded with explosions, gun fire, exotic cars racing across ice covered lakes.  There is an invisible car.  Say what?  Plenty of CGI stuff, not all good.  Dialog is often comprised of more double entendres than all previous Bond films combined.  I thought the sets looked faux and the gadgets, aplenty though they may be, were silly.  On the positive side, there is a nice homage to ""Dr. No"" and Ursula Andress featuring Halle Berry as American NSA agent Jinx Johnson who first meets 007 walking out of the ocean in an orange bikini.  Nice.  Overall, this is a very average Bond film and certainly not the worst.

Also nice is the excellent upgrade that the Blu ray provides over the old DVD.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the same as the original film.  The transfer looks very good.  Excellent color.  The stark white Iceland scenes really pop.  Detail is excellent, black levels very good.  Only the sharpest eyes will see some edge enhancement on larger screens.  The audio comes from a very active DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Surrounds and LFE channel are in constant action.  I did find certain scenes involving Miranda Frost needing a volume bump.  There are English and Spanish subtitles available and a French Dolby Surround 5.1 option.  As near as I can tell the extras are the same as what's on the DVD.",1409184000,,3229,4.573426573426573

1450895,3,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day isn't one of my favorite entries yet not the worst either. Pierce Brosnan was a good James Bond all around and nothing quite lived up to the classic ""GoldenEye"" which many fans refer to as his only good movie. It was certainly his best and one of the best Bond films ever but his other films were all passable and had their moments. Die Another Day has an alright plotline with some good action as well. Villain Gustav Graves plans to use solar energy to destroy the Korean Demilitarized Zone with a satellite using concentrated sunlight to break into South Korea. While the villains idea was decent, the Graves as a villain didn't seem all that threatening which is a flaw to the film as well as a couple cringe worthy moments. Bond surfing over an avalanche is one of them and possibly the worst moment in Bond history but it's only a small part of the film. The CGI is abysmal which bring the film down a huge step as well as the invisible car which make Die Another Day the least believable Bond film to date along with Moonraker. Die Another Day does have it's good moments though from a solid last role from Brosnan, Halle Berry wasn't great but decent as CSI agent Jinx and I personally liked Rosamund Pike as Bond girl/villain Miranda Frost. James Bond being captured in North Korea is classic Bond all the way as well as the first half of the film, the other on the other hand is forgivable if you don't take it seriously whatsoever and are expecting something much campier in the vein of Moonraker. I prefer the grittier, darker side of Bond such as From Russia With Love and Licence To Kill but Live And Let Die and Diamonds Are Forever are some of my favorites as well which I find a lot of fun to watch. Die Another Day doesn't have the same quality of those but is decent Bond despite being a bit uneven and a flawed entry for sure.",1399939200,,1862,4.368876080691643

1450953,4,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day (2002) may not be a masterpiece or a top five 007 film, but it's still very enjoyable and a heck of a lot of fun. I'm not exactly sure why this movie is seen as the weakest of the Brosnan-era Bond films, as I think it's really on par with his other three 007 films. The plot, which involves a doomsday device made of diamonds, is actually quite similar to the plot used in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) although the antagonists in this film are rouge North Koreans and not SPECTRE. The idea of having the main antagonist as a foreigner-enemy posing as a Westerner to construct a WMD to use against the West was the premise for Fleming's novel Moonraker (1955), which had little to do with the film of that name. The charismatic and over-the-top Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), the rouge North Korean colonel posing as the decedent Westerner, was an excellent villain, IMO. As always, the action scenes were exciting (the sword fighting, car chases, etc.) and Brosnan gave another great performance. Because Daniel Craig is such a terrific 007, it's easy to forget the Pierce Brosnan was also excellent, as he showed the sensitivity of Craig/Dalton but also the arrogant swagger of Connery and the tongue-in-cheek humor of Moore. Halle Berry, as Jinx, was one of the best Bond girls ever and one of the few who was Bond's true counterpart. As for criticism of too much CGI and the invisible car--eh, I thought that it was all good. Watching 007 surf over 1000 waves was pretty cool. The one negative?

I have watched a few of the Brosnan movies with my son recently (part of his Bond indoctrination :), including this and I have not liked any of them at all, especially after the new era of Craig's more human Bond.  Brosnan is too slick, the plots are not very clever, the stunts (spoiler alert!) like snowboarding down the vertical face of a giant falling ice cliff, are just too, too, too unrealistic.  Halle Berre as Jinx was boring.  Some of my japanese friends were offended that a Korean would choose to get a make-over as an white guy.  Even the title sequence was off-putting somehow. (Good song by Madonna, though.) I remained unconvinced that we were watching a Bond movie as I rolled my eyes at one scene after another.  I bailed out with a half hour left.

1451000,4,B00005JLBE,"...along with 1995's ""Goldeneye"".

Released in 2002, ""Die Another Day"" was Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final performance as James Bond. The film starts out in North Korea and then switches to Cuba, where Bond meets Jinx (Halle Berry); next Bond has a thrilling fencing match in Britain with the main villain (Toby Stephens) and the final act switches to an incredible ice palace in Iceland.

The first time I saw Brosnan on ""Remington Steele"" back in the 80s my first thought was, ""He'd make a great Bond"", and he does; but it's a different Bond than Connery or Moore and it takes time to get used to him. He lacks Connery's ultra-nonchalance and Moore's amused composure. Brosnan's coolness is more serious and less flirty.

Anyway, ""Die Another Day"" seems to get a bad rap and I'm not sure why since it provides all the usual Bond staples. The villains are good (Rick Yune being the second one) and the Bond babes are serviceable (Rosamund Pike being the second one). The best part of the film, for me, is the over-the-top sword fight at the manor. Although it's so extreme it's somewhat goofy, it may very well be the best sword fight in the history of cinema.

The second half, which mostly takes place in Iceland, has numerous good action sequences as well, even more goofy than the sword fight, like the iceberg tsunami on which Bond surfs (Why sure!); but it's not like this is the first time an action scene was totally ludicrous in a Bond picture.

Madonna sings the title song (and also has a cameo). The film runs 133 minutes.

I enjoy lot of James Bond movies over the years but seems to lose something in this one thats why I gave it a four star rating like The World is not Enough.  But for die hard core fans of Bond movies you will love the fight scenes, some very nice kill scenes of Bond killing off the two main villians and for others out there very nice special effects with the laser beam on the melting ice and so forth.  I also enjoy the one liner by Berry saying ""Looks like I broke her heart.""

1451098,3,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" was not as great as ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", but there were various facets of this film that made it still Bond-worthy.

Here's why:
1. Interesting and unique opening scene before the familiar Bond-music and opening credits start playing! Definitely worth watching the opening scene!
2. Interesting story about Bond and North Korea (which is eerily similar to what's going on today). Who knows, there may be a real British MI6 spy around North Korea...
3. Madonna makes a cameo appearance and looks so damn sexy (if only she were wearing less clothing...).
4. Catchy Bond-theme music by Madonna...

Here's why it doesn't compare to ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"":
1. No stereotypical ""cold-war"" era Russian villains and atmosphere
2. No hot chicks (except for Madonna...). Yes, Halley Berry (if that's how her name's spelled) is in this movie, but I didn't recognize her since she had short hair (which looks extremely ugly).
3. Not believable use of a satellite from space that shoots a laser to break-up ice in the (North or South) pole. C'mon, really? A satellite from space that shoots a laser??? What a joke.",1362268800,2,1152,4.994791666666667

1451161,5,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is often unfairly maligned as derivative of past Bond movies.  But that misses the point - as this was the 20th Bond film, released on the 40th anniversary of the first one (Dr. No 1962) this movie intentionally pays homage to the past, as noted in Michael Kelley's write-up.  As it turned out, paying tribute to Bond's past was especially important here, as the series was ""rebooted"" from scratch after this one, with Daniel Craig in the lead role.  So Die Another Day is both an homage to the past, as well as the end of an era - who wouldn't want to see that?

As a stand-alone Bond movie (i.e. disregarding the connections with the past), this is somewhat above average in my view.  But it's the connections with the past that move it significantly higher than that.  The connections are too numerous to mention them all, but consider - WARNING, MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD -

- At one point, Bond pretends to be an ornithologist, this is a reference to the fact that the original ""James Bond"" was an actual American ornithologist, who Ian Fleming respected and who's name was borrowed for his protagonist.

- Halle Berry appears out of the water in a swimsuit, a la ""Dr. No"".

- There is a diamond-studded space-ray, a la ""Diamonds Are Forever"".

- There's a use of lasers that reminds one of the famous ""Goldfinger"" scene.

- Many of the past technology gadgets are seen again (including at least two that I recognized from ""Thunderball""), and comments are made by Q's replacement which mirror Q's from the past.

- Speaking of technology/gadgets, some reviewers have derided the ""invisible car"".  I have no problem with the car, and I give credit to it being an Aston-Martin (albeit a new one) - a nod Bond's first gadget-laden car from ""Goldfinger"". I believe it's the first time an A-M has been featured since ""Goldfinger"", probably the best-loved film of the series.

- The connections to the past are endless, far more than I have revealed above (a connection with ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is especially memorable).  At one point I could even swear I saw one of that bad guys stroking a hand-held controller in much the way that Blofeld stroked his cat in various Bond films. A true Bond nut could probably find dozens of connections, and still miss a few of them.  How great is that for the 20th film, 40-year anniversary?

As far as the plot itself, making North Korean military leaders the bad guys was a great idea, something that still works today.  This is also easily the most technology laden Bond film, as the reboot with Daniel Craig sought to reduce the technology role.  And yet Bond is also very physical in this film, much like Connery and Dalton.  This is Pierce Brosnan's best acting work as Bond; I thought he was weak in Goldeneye, but grew into the role, getting better each time.

There are some lesser points of course.  The ending was not particularly strong IMO, though there was another nice homage to ""Goldfinger"" involving the airplane.  There's a ridiculous moment where Bond ""para-surfs"" on a wave of water; someone here suggested that was itself an homage to some of the more ridiculous moments in the Moore films, maybe so.  Like it or not, it lasts less than 15 seconds; I try not to let it detract from the rest of the film.  There are almost always ""cartoonish"" moments in these films, but that scene may be the most cartoonish one of all. At least it's memorable; memorably bad!  Some people have objected to the ice hotel as unrealistic - I don't know where they've been, because there are actual ice hotels (built new every year in winter), mainly in Scandinavian countries (and this one is in Iceland, so it fits).  Some people also object to the gene-therapy used to change appearances.  Sure that's far fetched, but it could also be an homage to Bond's own appearance change in ""You Only Live Twice"".

All in all, this is not to be missed, for those who have seen all the Bond films that went before it.  It does not work as well though if you haven't seen the earlier ones, so don't make this the first Bond film you see.  Best to view the other ones first, then this becomes the real treat that it was meant to be.",1359244800,5,4173,4.561073825503356

Of course, very little is plausible, but isn't that the case with every bond flick? Yep.

I thought the acting was excellent (although the 1st time we see HB coming out of the water & walking up the beach......She sure looked fiiiine, thats for sure, but c'mon HB, guys are gonna look at you no matter what, so no need to 'shake those buns', as you did in that scene...that was a but too much 'shake' ;>)...)

Brosnan did a very good job as did the whole cast.

I thought the premise & plot of the movie were excellent.

& as with all bond flicks, plenty of action, PLENTY, being the key word, & most all the action scenes were quite good.

The visuals were simply stunning. I mean stunning. Best 'visuals' in any bond flick up to that point, which is no surprise since 'visuals' get far better as technology advances, so its no surprise the visuals were far better then in older bond flicks & Im sure visuals will get better in future Bond flicks.

Anyway, most everybody covered the plot so no need to waste time on that...just figured I would put in my 2cents worth as I see many who did not like this flick & thats fine...evberybody has different tastes & different expectations so some loving it while others hated it, is no surprise.

But I for one LOVED this flick & it is one of my favorite bond flicks, & I liked most every bond flick, including the older ones.

It would be far easier to rank the ones that I thought were just so so, but die another day was not 'so so' to me...it was a fantastic flick.",1355270400,,1704,4.205521472392638

Tomorrow Never Dies was definitely the worst of Brosnan's films, but even that doesn't get much vitriol. I thought Quantum was much, much worse. I always hate the Bond movies that drag and don't connect with me. DAD honestly was very, very enjoyable. Maybe it's a film that alienated the more peculiar of fans, like Man With the Golden Gun, which was also immensely enjoyable? I heard some claim that they didn't like Diamonds Are Forever, another very good one? Do these people want to see the same movies over and over again? The one low point of the film was Halle Berry. She actually thought that the producers would give her a franchise based on her character. She is not very bright at all. This movie was filmed at the apex of her hype in Hollywood, and it wasn't long until she fell out of favor with the fans. Perhaps if there were a better Bond girl playing her character, the film would have done better.

As for the invisible car, it was actually being researched at the time, and still is, as a matter of fact. It was not science fiction. I tried to explain this to several naysayers, but they wouldn't listen to me.",1354060800,3,1511,4.47463768115942

After Brosnans two follow ups they came back with DIE ANOTHER DAY and I say it held up as the second strongest in the set and probably the most fun.

In the first act James Bond is prisoner in a Korean war camp for fourteen months only to return to the British Secret service disgraced. This was the first time we ever got to see the rawer side of Brosnan James Bond...this keeps the story held together while we get into some plot involving an evil korean super villain with a plan to execute a diamond powered laser beam. Not as strong footed in reality as Golden Eye, but it never feels forced... and who cares...

1451269,2,B00005JLBE,"With 1999's The World Is Not Enough seeing James Bond out of the twentieth century, plans were quickly afoot for the film that would see him enter the twenty first with a bang. That film would also be released in time for the series' fortieth anniversary in 2002. That film would be Die Another Day, which also Pierce Brosnan return for the fourth (and, ultimately, final) time as 007. The film was set to be an anniversary celebration of the series' legacy as well as the exciting way forward. Now, nearly a decade on from its release, the question is just how successful was it on both counts?

Let's start by examining Pierce Brosnan's final performance as Bond. After the somewhat harder edged Bond of the previous film, viewers would surely be expecting much of the same. To a certain extent, Brosnan and the film deliver just that. The film's first twenty minutes or so see a Bond behind enemy lines, betrayed, captured, tortured and eventually handed back over to his own side that doesn't trust him anymore. For these opening minutes, and indeed the film's first hour, Brosnan shines even when the rest of the film isn't (more on that later). The second hour of the film feels like Brosnan, like Connery and Moore before him, simply going through the motions to earn a paycheck. It's a shame as Brosnan shows he clearly could have been better in his last outing.

The rest of the cast though are mixed to say the least. Take Halle Berry as Jinx Johnson, the NSA agent turned Bond girl, for example. Both her performance and the writing feels like a walking, talking clich of the ""tough but sexy"" woman stereotype seen in countless films. It also doesn't help that Berry, despite winning an Oscar in the middle of filming, can't seem to deliver a single one of her clichd lines in a fashion that isn't cringe worthy. Much the same can also be said of Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves and Will Yun Lee as Colonel Moon, the film's villain split across two different characters, who both barely manage to play their respective roles on the very thin line that is parody. All of these characters come across as little more than clichs and caricatures, something made even worse by most of their counterparts in the other Brosnan films.

The supporting cast isn't much better. One can through the characters and spot characters better done in other Bond films be it Rick Yune as Zao, Emilio Echevarra as Raoul, Michael Gorevoy as Vlad or Michael Madsen as Damian Falco who is little more than a clichd, gung-ho American. There are some bright spots such as Rosamund Pike who absolutely shines as Miranda Frost, playing what is frankly the best role in the film that isn't Bond, Judi Dench's M and John Cleese making what would sadly turn out to be his only appearance as Q. The cast overall then is mainly disappointing.

What about the rest of the film then?

Well production value wise, the film is mixed as well. Peter Lamont's production design work is up to his usual standards ranging through the film's various locations including North Korea, Cuba, London and Iceland. The editing of Christian Wagner, an editor best known for working with Tony Scott and John Woo, is a major problem however due to an editing style that tries to bring the editing characteristics of those director's (including ""speed ramping"" at what can only be described as odd and random moments) into a Bond film with results that are frankly disastrous and do nothing but damage the film's pacing. That is only the start of the film's issues.

The film's action sequences are another issue. Some of the problem is down to Wagner's editing (especially in the car chase and climatic plane based fights in the climax). The big problem is that they feel stale. The surfing sequence in the film's teaser lacks any kind of danger or tension while the big hovercraft chase that follows it feels derivative of the boat chase that opened the previous film. Derivative is the word that also describes the other two aforementioned action sequences as well as both have had variations done far better in other Bond films. That's also without mentioning the oft-ridiculed CGI iceberg surfing sequence either which is exactly as bad as its reputation suggests. Oddly enough the film's best action sequence, the sword fight that comes midway through, is the one that is done the most traditionally and the most effectively. It seems sad that a sword fight, arguably one of the biggest action film clichs, feels the most original amongst more complex, and ultimately derivative, sequences.

Derivative is also the word that best describes the film's script as well. The film's various plot points (diamonds, villain's changing identities, Bond going rogue to get revenge, etc.) all have the feeling of having been just torn at random from other Bond films and then clued together to make a plot. For the first hour or so, the film gets away with it for the most part. Once Bond, and indeed the film, goes to Iceland though, the film becomes little more than a series of Bond film clichs stuck together. It also doesn't help that perhaps the biggest plot twists of the film are given away not by Bond but by bad writing and editing. The script also isn't helped by the fact that it is filled with the worst one liners and indeed basic dialogue in a Bond film post-Moore era. In fact, it's the weakest script the series has had since A View To A Kill nearly two decades before.

Where does all this leave Die Another Day, both as Brosnan's last Bond film and as a celebration of the Bond legacy? Between its various faults, this is the weakest of Brosnan's Bond films by far. As a celebration of the first four decades of 007's film adventures, this much is clear: the film is indeed embracing the series' legacy but doing so with all the wrong elements.

Halle Berry is terrible, she was trying to imitate Ursula Andress's famous bikini moment. And failed miserably, her acting was of the worst kind. Brosnan looked bored. Of course after the movie came out, he mentioned how that he wasn't going to do another Bond movie unless they focused less of CGI and more on the story. And that's all this movie is, an Ice hotel. Really?!, Really?!, invisible cars. And a fight between two souped up cars, One of the many problem I have is that MI6 has had an agent shadowing the bad guy for awhile. And amazingly she hasn't been able to come up with anything yet, that would raise a red flag with me. And surprise surprise surprise, turns out she's working with the villain all this time. This movie is on the same level as Moon Raker, A view to a Kill. I have to agree, when Brosnan went to cuba. You could tell he was trying to look cool and sexy, but he just came across as old and creepy. No, No, No, this movie is bad. The main plot you ask, why to use a laser in the sky. That's right, a laser in the sky. This was Brosnan's last movie, and I don't really blame him. Halle Berry was NOT, that good. Sorry, a terrible movie.",1348531200,6,1266,4.171428571428572
1451311,4,B00005JLBE,"Three surfers, including James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), enter North Korean by the sea.  They trick a helicopter to land in the wrong place and steal a passenger's brief case.  James Bond enters a North Korean military base posing as a buyer for weapons and paying with the briefcase full of diamonds.  The deal goes badly as he is recognized by Zao who is Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's assistant.  The briefcase is filled with African conflict diamonds.  In trying to escape Bond blows up the briefcase and Zao is injured as diamonds imbed themselves into his face by the force of the explosion.

Colonel Moon tries to escape Bond by using a hover craft as Bond commandeers another smaller one and chases after him.  In typical James Bond style a battle ensues and Colonel Moon goes over a waterfall in the hovercraft while Bond is captured and imprisoned in North Korea.  He is in prison and tortured for 14 months and then released in a prisoner exchange for Zao....

This is an action packed 007 movie with a high tech plot.  I didn't mention but Halle Berry in the story as Jinx a NSA agent.  As in most Bond films the movie is filmed in exotic locations around the world and the story line is very good.  Halle plays a perfect match to Pierce Brosnan's 007 and the chemistry is sultry.  Pierce has always played a good role as Bond and he doesn't disappoint us in this movie.  Even Madonna appears in a cameo role in the middle of the movie and she has an encounter with Bond while she introduces him to the antagonist of the film.

This movie has spectacular special effects and stunts that will really hold your attention.  There are several plot twists and turns and this movie is really a good one.  I recommend it to you.",1347580800,2,1722,4.503225806451613
1451312,5,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is a great movie. It has a good plot, a fascinating villain, a lovely Bond girl, plenty of tech toys which for a change seem to actually fit comfortably (for the most part), and even a funny appearance by John Cleese as Q. What's not to love?

  The plot of this movie stands out among the Bond films not based on Ian Fleming's original 007 stories. Unlike some of those, the names of which I will not single out, there are no silly villains or half-hearted threats. The danger feels real and believable as a genetically-modified North Korean military leader pulls a coup and then threatens to upset the balance of power in the decades old Korean conflict. His method is fairly standard for the genre- a satellite that can destroy anything on Earth. What the satellite does is pretty original though so that is ok. I will not comment further about it though so if you are interested you will have to watch it yourself.

  In addition to a believable villain and plot, the Bond girl stands out. It's Halle Berry playing NSA agent Jinx and she is hot in that role. Her acting performance is good, portraying a secret agent who is no helpless gal. She proves an interesting and more importantly useful partner for 007 as he seeks to take down our genetically altered North Korean friend.

  Bond films occasionally, as most 007 fans know, go over the top on the tech toys. The toys often feel overpowered for the task at hand. In Die Another Day, they seem to fit perfectly. The device that breaks glass comes in handy as does the invisible car. The car bothered me initially but the studio limits the hokeyness level of the scene by allowing the bad guys to ultimately notice the car even while invisible so that's ok. I will not give out any more spoilers on this topic. I do want to mention though there is a scene in the movie where some of the old toys from previous Bond films are briefly discussed. This is a fun part of the movie. I love John Cleese in his brief role as Q.

  The extras on the movie are standard fare. There are lots of nice things but nothing amazing. The video and audio on the Blu-ray transfer are amazing as all the 007 adventures have been so far. I highly recommend this film to Bond fans and to anyone who generally likes espionage thrillers or action movies. I give five out of five stars because the movie, acting, plot and special effects are all very good but additionally this was, as it turned out, Brosnan's last outing as Bond. It was a memorable one.

1451314,4,B00005JLBE,"2002's ""Die Another Day"" was Pierce Brosnan's last turn of several as James Bond.  The movie is true to the Bond franchise, pulling out all the stops in an action-packed story delivered by a solid cast.

The movie gets off to a great start, as a group of British agents make a unique entrance into North Korea on a secret mission.  The mission goes badly, and Bond is captured and tortured.  When finally exchanged, he finds himself under suspicion by ""M"" (Judi Dench) as the traitor who betrayed the mission.  A stubborn Bond escapes MI-6 confinement and strikes out on his own to prove his innocence.  A very unsanctioned trip to Cuba gets Bond reinstated and pairs him up with American agent Jinx (Halle Berry)in pursuit of a clever villain with two faces, a secret weapon, and ties to the real traitor inside MI-6.  The finale is a veritable haitstorm of fisticuffs, swords, and special efforts, as Bond tries to head off another Korean War.

This movie got mixed reviews, perhaps for trying too hard.  The plot gets off to a good start before becoming rather exotic, even by Bond standards, and then disappearing altogether in a relentless barrage of action sequences loaded with special effects.  ""Die Another Day"" will be enjoyable for fans of the franchise, even though this one might not be the best of the lot.",1328572800,,1320,4.724890829694323
1451315,5,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" was the 20th James Bond film and coincided with the franchise's 40th anniversary. The plot is pretty simple when compared to other Bond films: upon being released from captivity in North Korea Bond is determined to find out who was behind the kidnapping believing someone in the British government was behind the plot.

 The film received very mixed reviews upon release, but became the highest-grossing Bond film at that point making over $431,000,000 at the box office.

 I also must say Oscar-winner Halle Berry does a superb job playing the latest Bond girl.

 This was also Pierce Brosnan's final outing as the British super agent before heart-throb (and my personal favorite Bond guy) Daniel Craig took over.",1325030400,,732,5.058333333333334

1451317,3,B00005JLBE,"I firmly believe that the best thing Pierce Brosnan ever did was retire from playing James Bond.  Sure, he was great at it, but his career was better than the hokey movies his Bond flicks turned out to be.  Yeah, they have some merit, and overall they are entertaining, but this is a new age and a new Bond was needed, and the material that Brosnan was getting was just beneath him.  I mean, most people don't even realize that Pierce Brosnan is a good actor; but he is!

That said, this was his final run as the legendary womanizing secret agent, and it's certainly fun in its own right.  Brosnan still holds firm to the character he created in the mid-90's, not skipping a beat.  He's every bit as influentially charming as he was ten years prior.

In this installment, Brosnan (er, Bond) finds himself saddled between two sexy young things in the bodies of Halle Berry (yeah, Oscar be darned...I'm doing a Bond movie) and Rosamund Pike (by god, this woman has bloomed into one amazing actress over the past few years).  Go figure, Bond has to contend with hot women.  So, the villain is as unbelievable as the last one, and the hookups are outrageously twisted (in that Bond always has a knack for sleeping with the enemy that is almost surely pretending to be the friend).  The final catfight is worth the wait, despite its overt campiness.  It's that campiness that I was referring to in the outset of this review.  I'm glad that the reigns have been passed over, and despite the fact that the last Bond film wasn't as successful as `06's `Casino Royale', I strongly feel that the new direction is exactly what was needed to revamp interest in this decades old character.

Brosnan and his lady friends (including Dench, who was so born to play M) are all in fine form here, and the special effects and action sequences are up to Bond standards; and yet, the film is rather forgettable when you get passed it all.

It's fun, but nothing special.",1316044800,,1949,4.531428571428571

Ugh. This entry starts promisingly enough - Bond is taken prisoner and foresworn by MI6 - so that one could be momentarily forgiven for believing it might be more emotionally charged and character-driven than its predecessors. But when Madonna's misplaced theme-song kicks in, followed by the laser beams and ice palace, hope falters. And then the bloody invisible car shows up.

The violence is incredible (not incredibly good, just incredible) the invisible Aston Martin is ludicrous, and Ms. Berry as a spy for NSA???  Sorry, but besides the fact she radiates all of the emotional range from A to A, NSA (of which I am an alumnus) deals with electronic espionage and code breaking, not the kiss kiss bang bang stuff. The villain looks like he stepped out of a Brooks Brothers catalog, and despite his attempts at sneering malice, looks more like the guy who didn't get the part of Sebastian in Brideshead Revisited. I wouldn't spoil the plot of this movie by relating it here--the writers did that in their screenplay.  The editor should have chopped about twenty minutes off of this turkey, and the Madonna theme song is electronically altered disco garbage.

1451362,4,B00005JLBE,"I wish Amazon allowed 4.5 stars because I feel that is what this movie truly deserves.  A lot of people bad mouth Die Another Day and highlight all these things they see as problems.  The truth is, its a very well put together Bond film that utilizes today's technology.  It stars Pierce Brosnan (one of my favorite bonds because of his Dalton-like qualities) and Halle Berry who makes a very interesting Bond girl.

This film has a fantastic story line to me.  Bond is captured, traded back to MI6 but because the organization feels he may have been compromised, he is forced to escape and become a rouge agent of sorts.  There are a lot of twists and turns and things that I did not expect happening and to me that is what good Bond is about.  There is a fencing scene that is very well performed.  To me this is one of the great Bond scenes out of all the films.  I really enjoyed it.

Now for the overuse of CGI...really not a problem in my opinion.  Nothing looks fake to me, this just looks like the Bond of the future.  This whole series has been built on the outlandish and impossible so I feel it is right at home here.  Nothing that takes away from the movie.

Product placement.  A lot of people have complained about the product placement in this movie but I honestly think that is because 1 fanatic recognized it and then spread the word.  As the normal viewer I watched this movie many times without noticing the placement advertising.  Only after someone mentioned it on a forum did I go back and look for it and see it for myself.

There is beautiful scenery going on in this film, as there is in all Bond films.  But this is exceptional.  Very polished, a great variety of landscapes, visually pleasing all around.  Plus, that new technology everyone disliked?  Yeah, you can thank it for this being one of the best looking and sounding Bond films yet.

This also was the highest grossing Bond film until Casino Royale.  All the bad reviews you read on sites are completely wrong in my opinion.  I'm still trying to figure out what exactly hardcore Bond fans didn't like about this movie.  To me there are way weaker Bond films.

1451367,1,B00005JLBE,"Maintaining great quality in a long running movie series is near impossible and falling off the ball will eventually happen. I can understand how the writing and direction will slide after years, natural and understandable. One thing I can't understand is how a film can be created were it becomes a stereotype of the series it is from, Die Another Day in the James Bond film series is one. DAD marked the 20th film and 40th anniversary of the series. You would think a celebration of the Bond film franchise will inspire something truly grand, instead loyal fans get slapped in the face. The very worst of Bond is glorified in the abortion that is Die Another Day. All the bad stereotypes of Bond films are here; An over flow of bad one liners, highly over the top plot, and a one dimensional and bland villain who tries to be sophisticated and menacing. This is the only Bond film I can safely say is directly aimed at the fourteen and under crowd.

The movie starts off good with something unexpected and actually interesting at the end of the pre-title sequence, Bond is captured and tortured in North Korea thanks to the evil Colonel Moon by Will Yun Lee. The torture itself is nothing to speak of really; You barely see it in the title sequence because it's being drowned in CGI effects and a Madonna song to offend to ears. The material girl also makes a few mercifully short cameos in the films. Anyway After the swirl of CGI title sequence vomit, Bond, who still has the energy to make bad quips after allegedly under going horrible pain for quite some time, is arrested by MI6 after being accused of leaking secrets during his capture. In a rather clever escape he swims to his yacht club which happens to be mere moments away from the ship he was being held on. Yes, it does get worse people. MI6 must be a rather lazy organization because Bond freely travels to Cuba and then to London of all places without any detection at all. After a series of lame one-liners and various stupid events, Bond confronts his villain-o-matic dubbed Gustav Graves played by Toby Stephens. He is in fact Colonel Moon who had DNA transplant *groan* to become a childish white guy who has a neat robo-cop suit that controls a giant sun lamp. I honestly can't even say much of this is original either.

The lines and moments are mostly recycled from all the old Bond movies and they are not even used right. One excellent example of screwing up the old material was Jinx's (Halle Berry) first appearance on the beach; This scene was copied from Honey Rider's famous entrance in Dr. No. The reason why Honey's entrance was so grand was because it was beautifully subtle; Honey naturally walks up on the beach and it didn't feel forced. Jinx's entrance was not only slow motion, which felt incredibly forced, but it was obvious the director told her to act like she was being shot by a camera; Ergo ruining the beautiful subtlety of what could have been a well done homage. The main plot is a combination of Diamonds Are Forever and Goldeneye with a giant space based satellite weapon called Icarus aka the sun lamp of doom. Many another moments were cut and paste into this film from past Bond adventures including a plot twist about Miranda Frost's (Rosamund Pike) true identity which was in fact stolen from the previous Bond turkey, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. I could be mistaken but I think incompetent Jinx character, who kills no one of any value to the film and is constantly captured, was based on the bungling Mary Goodnight from THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.

So what is original in this film ? I guess the fact that the major villains are not even 35. That Pierce Brosnan was the heaviest actor to play Bond, no major offense of course I rather have a fat Bond then the skinny wimp in GOLDENEYE. Ah yes, the virtual reality simulation ! Yes Bond gets his own holo-deck in this film for basic training and is exploited once more at the end of the film for a lame gag involving Bond going hog wild over Moneypenny.

When this wretched film finally ends you wonder what happened to the series after 40 years, why it had become a follower instead of a leader by making kids play villains with Matrix-style action sequences.

1451401,3,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was the film released to celebrate Bond's 40th anniversary in the movies.  It was also Brosnan's 4th and last appearance as Bond.  To be honest, its a fairly average Bond film and the weakest of Brosnan's 4 films.  Brosnan's James Bond films started at the top with the terrific Goldeneye and slowly worked their way downward with each film.
Each Bond film since Goldeneye have been incredibly successful.  However, the 2 best Bond films ""Goldeneye"" and ""Casino Royale"" have been directed by 1 man:Martin Campbell who did a fabulous job on both of those films.  The other 4 of the last 6 have been directed by different director with varying results.  This one was directed by Lee Tamahori, who not long afterward was arrested for solicitation.(Remember the good old days when Terrence Young directed 3 out of the 4 first great Bond films and John Glen directed Roger Moore's last three and Timothy Dalton's 2 excellent Bond films.  I do not like having a different director on each new film and hearing how great they've done because the film makes money.  The last Bond film ""Quantum of Solace"" was as mediocre as this one.  Yet I've heard the director Marc Forster proclaimed a genius because the film made boatloads of money. I hope he never does another one.)  As stated the film is average with the high point being a vicious swordfight between Bond and the villain.  Low points of this film included a terrible CGI sequence of Bond basically surfing over a tidal wave (don't even ask how this occurs) and Bond driving a stealth (invisable) car.  The film got a lot of publicity by having Halle Berry as the leading lady, right after she won her Oscar.  She is okay but I prefer the frosty Rosamund Pike as the secondary female lead.  The pre-credits sequence and conclusion are average by Bond standards.  (The film does try something new by having Bond captured at the end of the pre-credits sequence and tortured throughout most of the opening credits.)  The very average theme song was done by Madonna, who has a cameo in the film as a fencing instructor lusting after the lovely Rosamund Pike.
As stated, by Bond standards this isn't even close to the great films in the series.  It also was not a great film for Pierce Brosnan to go out on.  I always felt he had at least 2 more Bonds in him.  I guess the producers got tired of hearing him badmouth each film afterward and talk about things like wanting Quentin Tarantino to direct a Bond film.  However the producers have got to be jumping for joy after the grosses of Daniel Craig's 2 Bonds.
The extras on the blu-ray are basically the same as on the DVD.",1262995200,2,2636,4.6038543897216275

1451404,2,B00005JLBE,"As I've told numerous people asking me how my foray into the Blu-Ray Bond releases, I wish I could have skipped over Die Another Day. The minute I left theaters after seeing Pierce's last foray into Bond-dom, I knew that it was my least favorite of the entire franchise. Handily.

It wasn't my least favorite during the entire running time, though. As the 40th anniversary film, Die Another Day was almost a call back to the best moments from the previous Bonds, and featured elements of Moore, Connery, and Dalton. Sadly, somewhere along the line the film entered the dreaded Camp territory; not to the degree of Batman the Movie, but damned close.

Of all of Brosnan's Bond films, this is the one they decide to test the Blu-Ray waters with? The one with the glacial car chases, invisible car, DNA-altering space madman, and Halle Berry? (Okay, Halle Berry would be a damn good reason for high-def-but read on and you'll see why that isn't the case.) It's certainly the weakest Bond film since Moonraker, and fans were so put off by it that the next Bond film had to reboot the franchise.

But, like I said, it isn't ALL bad. The first 30 to 40 minutes are some of the most entertaining in any genre film; the rest of it, though... I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Peter Travers came out with the review snippet, ""Die Another Day? Why can't I Die Now?""

Now, movie aside, you would think that when it comes to the six Bond films being released in high-def, this would have the best quality. Wrong. It's the worst. Somehow, someway, they managed to take the second newest Bond movie and put out a Blu-Ray transfer which actually looks worse than standard def on an HDTV. The film is grainy around just about all CGI aspects (of which there are plenty), and they didn't even try to clean up noise. (Except for shadows, which are unnaturally black compared to other portions of the screen.) On an HDTV the standard DVD release arguably looks better; on an SDTV it obviously looks better. The entire point of a Blu-Ray release is to bring the film to high-def, so why make it look worse?

At least the audio keeps the film on track. Once again we get a remastered 5.1 with lossless audio, and it sounds fantastic. From effects to dialogue to music, the movie has never sounded better-even in theaters.

So the movie is largely stale, the video transfer flopped, and the audio is fantastic. What about the extras? Shockingly, they too are worse than the other Bond films offered in this go-round. While the others are pretty much straight DVD-to-Blu-Ray ports of extras, Die Another Day actually loses one of its best featurettes (the Ministry of Propaganda) in this release.

The features which did make the cut are all solid, even if they aren't presented in HD and look it, but the highlight has to be the commentary by Pierce. It's the first time a Bond performed commentary on a scene-by-scene basis, and it's a real treat for fans. The other features range from boring to so-so, but the other star is most likely the trivia track. It's fun for Bond fans (although non-fans will hate you for playing it), and it does give some life to an otherwise sparse extras lineup.

If you're the type who has to own all of the Bond movies and want to make the jump to high-def, then you're going to get Die Another Day regardless of what I've said. If you were on the fence between picking this or any other Bond film from this set, however, keep in mind that the video transfer for DAD is one of the worst I've seen for a modern movie.

1451405,4,B00005JLBE,"Up until the final third of Brosnan's last Bond, things are pretty solid, in fact the first hour is sensational.  This may be the most consciously stylish directorial job of this period in the series.  The two main villains (and the three actors who play them) are quite effective and there's a terrific score (not counting Madonna's theme.)  The deliberately over-wrought fencing face-off displays the director's assured, unique tone.  It was usually ""personal"" for Brosnan's Bond, and he may convey that best here.  Then we get to Iceland and that darn car comes into play.  Still worse, is Bond's Icelandic, surfing scene (which puts me in mind of those polar bear Coke ads) and the final two over-blown action set pieces that are so CGI-heavy it's impossible to suspend ever mounting disbelief.  (Indeed, the Ice hotel car chase, like the earlier hovercraft chase are both kind of hard to follow.)  Halle's hot, but her character could have used a little sense of danger as well -- she's almost too cute.  (Plus it seems like many of her lines were re-recorded.)  The film also has to have the lamest sexual badinage in the series.

The extras here include Brosnan's commentary and a good doc on the writers.",1247875200,4,1212,4.834951456310679

1451408,2,B00005JLBE,"All in all this episode is sad: graced by a beautiful Halle Berry who does well as a secret agent but seems rather unconvinced (and unconvincing) and by the skill of Toby Stephens who is a bit over a top (even for a Bond villain) but is impressive all the same, this Die Another Day failed to convince me.

This is the first film I can remember where the long opening sequence is tightily connected with the rest by a so to say ""narrative"" title sequence: usually we face a display of gorgeous naked women with guns essentially unrelated to the film if not in general atmosphere, here Bond is tortured exactly during this title sequence and the whole is vital for a correct understanding.
Whether this is good or bad, the viewer having no time to digest the opening sequence, I am not sure.

I loved Madonna's theme too: she probably went too far in blanching her own -not too beautiful- timbre to give an automated machine sound to it, but the song is meaningful to the film, extremely original and consistent. The great performers of past films usually made it clear it was a moment of vocal edonism: here the viewer gets repeatedly slapped.
By the way, Madonna's cameo was quite good: she is given short lines which are good for the plot and easy for her to say; her character is perfectly clear and sound, a thing which cannot be said for those of Zao and Miranda who add very little glamour to the product.

Brosnan is rather stockier here -still a good looking fellow but he has not aged well or perhaps he was tired- but he is not the problem (remember when Moore was there): the script and the direction are: this Bond episode is a disjointed group of nice action scenes with lovely special effects that never come to life as a meaningful whole.
The rhythm is faulty, the suspence never there, the whole never convincing.",1240963200,,1829,4.503012048192771

So Bond's license to kill is rescinded along with his freedom by M (Judi Dench) and is ordered to be send to an evaluation center in the Falklands...

Determined to clear his name and find out who really betrayed him in North Korea, Bond soon escapes and tracks Zao to Cuba, who was undergoing a 'D.N.A. transplant,' in a strange clinic, to heal his ravaged face... There, he finds someone else after the Korean, a capable secret agent, called Jinx...

After having proved himself to MI6 and to the NSA, Bond returns to London and has a spirited fencing match with Graves at the Blades Club... There he meets his publicist the gorgeous Miranda Frost...

In ""Die Another Day,"" Brosnon is wild, and ready to light the fuse on any explosive situation... His methods are to provoke and confront... His Aston Martin is loaded with high tech gadgetry that renders his vehicle invisible to Zao's sporty Jaguar... There's an amazing chase between the two across the frozen waters of Iceland... There's also an interesting battle inside Graves' treacherous fortress; and two battles to the death aboard Graves' airplane ...

Halle Berry is one of the Bond girls who looks so stunning especially when she emerged from the Cuban waters in her bright orange bikini... This Oscar-winning beauty matches 007 in intelligence, sophistication and toughness, leaving Bond in the island in an explosive situation...

Toby Stephens as the psycho billionaire Gustav Graves appears determined to use his unique satellite the Icarus using its power to 'bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world... or to clear the minefield creating a highway for his North Korean's troops... Rosamund Pile plays the fencing master with breathless beauty Miranda Frost...

Rick Yune plays Zao, the dangerous Korean arms dealer and sports-car aficionado who works for Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee), the renegade North Korean army officer who was determined to invade the south...

Michael Madsen plays Damian Falco, NSA spy master and Jinx's boss who's tough on Bond...

If I had to compare this to anything, it's the ""Schumacher's Batman & Robin"" of the Bond series; that is to say, a cartoonish shell of our beloved hero. This isn't Bond -- it's pure fantasy, begging far too much of the imagination, which is saying a lot considering the trademark of all Bond films of being over-the-top.

Brosnan is fine, and so is Berry. The problem lies in the script and production design. While there is a few good scenes, few are memorable. The opening sequence is terrible (especially the title song), the villian forgettable, the gadgets are more like Michael Bay's wet dream.

Unfortunately I must conclude that it really IS that bad--at least the second half.  The compelling opening sequence features a vulnerable 007 being tortured by the North Korean army and even boasts a cane-seat chair, though it's not put to such sinister use as the one Daniel Craig sat on.  I happen to  like Madonna's driving-techno titular theme theme song as much as I like ""You Know My Name"", which is bunches.  Halle Berry is lovely to look at, but as Jinx receives no assistance from a script that requires her to deliver lines like ""Ornithologist, huh?  Now there's a mouthful"" while staring at 007's crotch.  The thrust-and-parry of sexual inneudo between Bond and his ladies has always been one of the hallmarks of the series, but here they overdo it in extremis.  What is supposed to be sparkling repartee falls flat as a bored and weary-looking Brosnan delivers the Bond bons mots with nary a twinkle.  It almost looks as though he could be thinking, ""My God, I'm old enough to be her dad.""  Their bedroom scene does have the requisite zest, proving that Brosnan's 007 was hardly ready for pasture, but rather an unfortunate victim of timing and increasingly lousy scripts.  Brosnan was a capable physical actor, but was hampered by overbloated CGI; the fight sequences here are painfully faked up, unlike the Craig era where the punches seem all too bone-crunchingly real.  Quizzically, two of the crafters behind the superb ""Casino Royale"" script, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade, are also responsible for this turkey.  Upon moving to the centerpiece Icelandic sequence, which goes on for an eternity, DAD rivals ""Moonraker"" for Most Cheesy Sci-Fi Moments Ever. John Cleese provides all-too-brief comic relief; having fully succeeded the late Desmond Llewellyn in the role, he is no longer 'R' but has been fully promoted to 'Q', which stands for 'Quartermaster'--duh, of course!  My favorite moment is a steamy makeout session between Bond and Moneypenney that is no less scorching for being all in her head, compliments of a virtual simulator.  Or should I say 'stimulator'?  Brosnan may have been supplanted by a worthy successor in Daniel Craig, but silly scripts and ridiculous CGI aside, he is still capable of leaving me both shaken and stirred.",1227571200,3,2425,4.875609756097561

- The Gunbarrel opening scene- stupid bullet and the calypso version of the theme...

- That god-awful Madonna song... Techno and Bond do NOT mix!

- The stupid vanishing car.

- LAME WRITING. I don't think I've ever met someone named ""Mr. Kil""

- The lair looked like a disco with lasers everywhere

1451561,3,B00005JLBE,"I try and be as positive and optomistic as I can, so I start on to the good news, and then on to the bad.

THE GOOD: I loved the Christ/Resurrection sub-themes of ""D.A.D."" intensely. The title itself hints at this broadly. In the prisoner exchange, and for the next 15-odd minutes, Bond's ""second life"" is quite revealing: the long hair and beard; his tortured body, looking as if he'd been scourged--quite literally, too; the Christ-like dignity of Bond's bearing--heading for even greater sacrifices for the Free World's sins; resurrection/back to life, after a meditation-induced heart attack; and occasionally Pierce holding his body in cruciform poses.

And the spy-bosses acting in (false) judgement, just like Grand Rabbi/Priest Caiaphas and Procurator Pilate. Those would be ""M"", Falco, and old General Moon.

There are even (Anti-)Christ resurrections amongst the bad guys. Zao and young Moon possibly died, albeit temporarily and then their bodies gutted by DNA therapy, to come back (resurrect), in new identities.

And even a Judas, too, in Ms. Frost.

These sub-theme elements, and other sub-theme elements of increasing sophistication--most notably from Brosnan onwards--is precisely what injects new life into The Bond Franchise, just when I'd thought that the franchise, HAD ""died another day""!!

THE BAD: I know it's not my DVD players, but the Comprehensive Audio Track for my particlar (early?) edition was poorly mastered. Dialogue drop-offs; Music Track obscuring dialogue and Sound FX Track at times; Music Track dropping off for Dialogue; Sound FX Track going quiet for the Music Track; and the great bark of Bond's new souped-up Walther sounding more like a 0.22 or pellet pistol! This reason alone, is why I only rate this Three Stars. The Sound Mastering on all the other 19 Bond Title DVD's is perfect, as far as I know.

1451562,5,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day consists of a reworking of plot elements and ideas from most, if not all, of the previous 19 Bond films. Where something appears which is new to Bond, it is certainly not new to the action genre of the last 10 years. In short, the producers and writers were out of ideas and the best they could do is string together a number of climaxes with a Bond-shaped piece of string.  It is also a movie of two halves, and halftime is the point where Bond returns to England. Up until that point, the narrative and the action are reasonable enough (for a join-the-dots adventure story). Then we move into the theatre of the absurd, commencing with the parachute arrival of our main villain. It is a measure of how convincing this character was that I was instantly calling him ""Lord Flashheart"" when he appeared. Most of the story is downhill from there, from the ""invisible"" car to the absurd way Miranda Frost jumps into bed with Pierce Brosnan to protect their cover to the shenanigans aboard the plane at the movie's (eventual) climax of climaxes.",1219968000,,1057,4.592592592592593
1451563,2,B00005JLBE,"Having grown up with Bond Movies, and I have seen EVERY ONE of them, I must say, D.A.D. was the WORST piece of celluloid EVER (IMHO).  The CGI effects in this Madonna laced guano-fest, must have been put together by a cage full of chimps.  The scenes with Iccarrus, Bond parasailing on a tidal wave, and racing a giant heat ray were all cartoonish.  If you look at past Bond movies, there is not an overly large amount of CGI.  After all, the Broccoli family (Producers of almost all JB movies), are know for their over-the-top stunt work.  In most of the movies, Bond would have new and more difficult stunts, it was one of the reasons I went to see them.  You never saw the same stunt twice.

I was happy to see they went more ""traditional"" in Casino Royale.  (One of the best Bond movies EVER made.)

As for Ms Berry, I think she is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in movies today, she was really the only worthwhile reason to watch D. A. D.  as most of the rest of the flick was nearly unwatchable.  Even Mr Brosnen looked as if he would have been doing anything except this awful movie.

I really doubt Blu-Ray will be able to save this dog of a movie.  However, if you like Halle Berry, it almost worthwhile picking up the Blu-Ray version. All-in-all, you may want to do something more useful with the $23.95 they have the nerve to charge.  I mean, the darn movie has a prolonged scene that includes a sword fight and it is inflicted with Madonna's awful acting, fake British accent, and ever widening.....Waist.

The players were all good excepting Halle Berry.  She was hard to watch. One can just imagine a NASDAQ feed with her lines running across her forehead. Line reader - not actor. Also it seemed that she modeled either her body, or the clothes that she wore in every scene that she was in.  Yawn.  Clearly she never got a firm grasp, or any for that matter, on her part as Michelle Yeoh did in Tomorrow Never Dies.

Too bad (for the writers).  In the 40th year of Bond most of the regulars seemed tired, leaving us with a disillusioned and drinking M.  One can see why the producers went backwards in time and re-energized the franchise with a new Bond.  It was time.",1203465600,,909,4.4939024390243905
1451566,2,B00005JLBE,"Sadly, Brosnan's fourth and last outing as Bond is as tired, cheesy and over the top as Roger Moore's 4th Bond movie was.. Given that original script ideas for this story were taken from Moonraker, the symmetry is ironic.
Bond is captured in Korea, but is released as a prisoner transfer because the Americans suspect he has broken under torture.  Removed of his 00 status (what, again?) he goes renegade to track down the mole that betrayed him.  Along the way he crosses paths with a CIA agent (Halle Berry) and the trail leads to Gustaf Graves (Toby Stephens).  Graves' unlikely Iceland diamond mine is a cover for the development of a powerful satellite based weapon which uses diamonds to focus the sun's energy to... oh, who cares, its all as ridiculous, if not more so, than a compilation of Bond's worst moments.
The movie muddles through feeling like someone forgot to shake OR stir, until the awful moment when the movie becomes irredeemably lost.  A cgi Bond surfs on a wave using a parachute for guidance, in one of the most abysmally poorly executed special effects scenes put to film.  Bond movies are always fantastic, sure, but they always have a veneer of reality - the gadgets look like they COULD work, the stunts you see are done for real, even if the stuntmen do have safety wires.. but here, all that heritage is thrown out the window, and the movie never quite recovers.  Indeed, a few scenes later Bond gets into his invisible car just to seal the deal.
On the plus side there is a stunning set piece car chase on ice, with the Jaguar and Aston Martin going tete a tete, a pleasing sword-fight ina gentlemans club in London, and David Arnold puts in his usual excellent score with multiple references to previous movies for the fans.  Indeed, the numerous references to previous movies (most notably in the `Q' sequence, with gadgets from previous movies littering the background) are one of the few real pleasures of the movie.  Halle Berry performs her task of looking hot in leather, and doing `that' walk out of the sea emulating Ursula Andress but with none of the mystery or charm.  Rosamund Pike puts in a decent performance, and Judi Dench does what she is supposed to... but John Cleese is just not quite right yet as Q (though better than TWINE), and cameos from Madonna and Michael Madsen are an embarrassment.  Toby Stephens does his best to make his hard to believe character believable, but none of the actors can rescue the movie from some of the most painful one liners and simply awful lines for many a year.  A large chunk of the blame has to go to director Lee Tamahori, whose propensity for slowing and speeding up events is more `The Matrix' than Bond's classic style.

With an overblown budget and anticipation running as high as it had for a Bond movie, Die Another Day didn't just lose the race, it fell flat on its face somewhere along the way.  Sure, you have to watch it to complete the Bond saga, but be grateful that just as Moonraker's excesses inspired the makers to return to basics in For Your Eyes Only, we can thank Die Another Day for bringing the producers to their senses and whittling Bond down to the basic ingredients again for Casino Royale.

For an Ultimate Edition, this is the least well stocked disc in the extras department - no trailers, few documentaries, no music video etc.. however, it has to be said the extras included do cover the making of process from script through to realisation pretty well.  An hour long documentary on script to screen is moderately revealing, and the other half hour documentary gives a fascinating glimpse into what it takes to get an Aston Martin to slide like that on ice - and what happens when it goes wrong. Extras are rounded out with a 3 minute peek into how British Airways helped out, and Peter Lamont's home video of location scouting and a video diary of one day in the shoot, giving a glimpse into Lee Tamahori's directorial style.",1202947200,,3948,4.62
1451567,2,B00005JLBE,"I have been a 007 fan for over 25 years and like every good fan out there, I have all of the 007 films. I absolutely love several of them and have watched many of them repeatedly. I love most of the classic Connery films, ""Goldfinger"", ""From Russia With Love"", ""Dr No"" and I adore several of Roger Moore's lavish films most notably ""Live and Let Die"" (despite it's shortcomings), ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and my absolute favorite ""For Your Eyes Only"". There is one film on this ever-expanding series however that will not win any multiple viewings from me and I'm afraid ""Die Another Day"" is it.

Although ""Moonraker"" is often criticized and crowned by most fans as one of the worst, if not THE worst in the series (although I disagree and would cite ""Diamonds are Forever"" as the second worst after this one), I think ""Moonraker"" is vastly superior to the CGI infested cheese-fest that is ""Die Another Day"". Even for a Bond film this stretches all levels of believability and in my opinion, was lame beyond rational explanation. Although several people had problems with the plot, that was the least of my worries since I do not watch a Bond film for realism. I expect an irrational, unbelievable, madcap story line. It's part of the fun. One of the problems I had with this entry was that several of the characters, Bond included, became too super human. The 2 good guys became unbelievable super heroes with the ability to do things that even Spiderman would have a hard time doing. The film is also riddled with too many let-downs and too many ""you've got to be kidding me?"" moments (almost as much as ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and ""Transformers 2"" if that is even possible).

The film relies on too much CGI (and it's not even good CGI), a weak title song, a stiff cameo by none other than Madonna but more damaging are some laughably bad action sequences involving an invisible car, a melting ice Castle in Iceland and featuring the ever invincible Bond traveling faster than light and then surfing through Icelandic tidal waves holding on to 2 parachutes. The film's haphazard climax is also too unbelievable and you cannot expect me to suspend my disbelief this much. I mean, really? At least, ""Moonraker"" was a decent film the first 90 minutes (before Bond went to space) and most importantly, it didn't take itself seriously unlike this installment. Despite all of the negatives, I couldn't give this film a 1 star rating because despite the ridiculousness of it all, I was still somewhat entertained by its over-blown spectacle and numbing CGI effects.

One of my favorite Bond films ""For Your Eyes Only"" followed ""Moonraker"" and breathed some much needed life and realism in to the series. Luckily for the franchise, ""Casino Royale"" did the same thing but it doesn't keep ""Die Another Day"" from being bottom of the barrel Bond",1201478400,6,2844,4.71830985915493
1451568,3,B00005JLBE,"The majority will agree that this is one of the lesser successful of the Bond films, and I will have to agree with that.  Things begin with an explosive start at the pre-credits scene, but slowly and surely, it all falls apart until the dreaded finale.  Like even the worst of Bond films (which are very few) there are still going to be some highlights, and with Die Another Day, that mostly consists of some fun action scenes.

A great story is told here with some good ideas and originality, but execuation is the problem.  While on a mission in North Korea, Bond is actually captured and abandoned by MI6 for well over a year.  Frightened that Bond may have given information about MI6 while under torture, the service exchanges one of the Korean's - ""Zao"" - for Bond.  Bond is held in a hospital in Hong Kong by M, but escapes and decides to go on a personal vendetta that we don't see too oftenin a Bond film.  Eventually, we learn that both Bond and MI6 are after the same man ""Gustav Graves"", and decide to work together again.

Graves is an interesting villain in that he is not quite himself.  I would explain more but that would give away one of the better parts of the film.  The trouble with Graves is that his character seems to go downhill throughout the film, to the point of wishing to finally see him die.  His henchman ""Zao"" was pretty decent, and though not nearly the best henchman in a Bond movie, I enjoyed his presence more than Graves, and his facial features were most unique - diamonds embedded in his face from an earlier explosion.  Zao has several small fights with Bond, but its an extremely fun car chase on ice that is the highlight.  The other charcaters in the film, mainly the Bond women, were very uninteresting.  Though Halle Berry has the role of a secret agent herself, I felt she could have done so much better with the part.  One would think Berry was capable of more than the performance she gives.  As for the other girl - Miranda Frost - something about her personality never clicked from the start, though it was interesting to see exactly whose side she was on in the end.

Exotic locations seem to have gone the way of the dodo in this film.  Locations include North Korea, Cuba, and Iceland.  However, its obvious that the North Korea in the film is a made up set. The Cuban shots were actually filmed in Spain, and the Iceland scenes were made up as well.

There are some great action scenes in the movie, but all heavily relying on digital effects, lossing that classic Bond action feel.  The car chase scene on the ice is excellent, and so is the hovercraft chase before the credits in North Korea.  There is also a fun swordplay scene between Bond and Graves thats fun when it gets out of hand.

Pierce Brosnan's last film as 007 sadly hit a sour note.  His charcater got a litte more interesting this time around, but its too bad Brosnan couldn't put a little more into it.  While he seemed to have finally gotten comfortable with the role of 007, he has now gotten a little too relaxed.  Oh well.  Casino Royale with Daniel Craig has come to pick up the Brond franchise and put it back on its feet after this.

The World is Not Enough was not bad either, but seemed slower to me. Die Another Day had a great opening scene, a great theme song, and one of the coolest car chases in the bond movies...maybe second to For Your Eyes Only!

The surfing scenes and the invisible car are interesting but there is just nothing to Bond, the man.  Casino Royale is a superior movie and should be the benchmark for all future Bond movies.

In other words, you get outrageous action scenes, Rambo--like mentality, a wild and fun villain, a ""hot"" female lead helping Bond, a bunch of sexual innuendos, a hokey-but- interesting story and some outstanding opening credits. I never had any complaints with Pierce Brosnan playing Bond. I thought he very credible in the role, sincerely macho and debonair at the same time. Halle Berry was at her peak, so male viewers had no complaints watching here. She wasn't in here just for looks; she was in fighting shape, too.

Is the story far-fetched? Yeah, a little! Ludicrous? You bet. Entertaining? Sure. Who watches these films for their intelligence?",1189036800,4,809,4.771428571428571

It amazes me that fans take the film so serious and hate it.  I can see why though.  It is very far out and it feels like what Moonraker tried to do.  Im actually not a fan of Moonraker at all.  Its my least favorite, so its not like I love this film just because its more far out.  I just liked it due to the fact that its very entertaining.  I hadnt watched it in nearly  half a year and just watched it. I still love it.  Die Another Day is just dumb fun for me.  Its not to be taken seriously.  Its just to let you have fun.  Like I said, I can see why other fans wouldnt like it, but I think they just want the film to be something it isnt.  So many talk about its CGI shots as well.  They are NOT that bad.  Ive seen movies made within this year that look awful compared to this.  Im sure they weren't cheap either.  These effects aren't nearly as bad as people say.  I have seen so much worse.

But, those of us who have become Toby Stephens fans after Masterpiece Theatre's ""Jane Eyre"" can fast-forward through to enjoy the parachuting-into-London scene and especially the swordfight scene, which features Toby in a sleeveless tight-fitting outfit that shows off his fantastic body (yum!). Toby's swordfighting is action-movie-worthy yet so graceful it almost looks like dancing (you can see more of it on the extra disc, which breaks down the swordfight so you can see how it was filmed -- lots of fun -- and also on the pop-up commentary on the first disc, where Toby appears in cruddy black sweatpants rehearsing the swordfight, talking about swordfighting, and looking heart-stoppingly gorgeous). The movie also includes a few examples of Toby's superb sneer -- and smile. His other mannerisms in the film appear to have been based on Richard Branson, and an excellent impersonation it is. He delivers the wooden, stupid dialog as well as anyone could (it's not his fault the movie is so ridden with idiodic puns and cliches).

How annoying !",1173744000,29,258,4.976744186046512
1451617,4,B00005JLBE,"In 2002 Pierce Brosnan returned for the fourth and final time as James Bond, in the twentieth official Bond film.  I enjoyed this film more than ""The World Is Not Enough,"" but less than ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""  I find it interesting that so many Bond fans dislike this movie so much.  There are things about this movie to dislike, but this movie has as much going for it as the other Bond movies with a strong science fiction flavor, and perhaps more than some.

This Bond movie begins with Bond penetrating North Korea.  However, something goes wrong and North Koreans capture Bond.  During the opening credits we see bits and pieces as Bond is tortured and Madonna sings a song from her electronic period (can we say ""yuck?"").  Soon after the credits are finished Bond is traded for diamond decorated Zao (Rick Yune).  Bond is not pleased that he was traded, but is even less pleased that he is being considered a traitor.  Bond is not one for waiting for things to happen, so he escapes from custody to discover that he is in Hong Kong.

Bond slowly discovers that Zao and Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) are somehow linked.  Gustav demonstrates the Icarus solar satellite in Iceland, both for its ostensible purpose (providing light in dark regions of the world when needed) and for a far more nefarious purpose.  Bond never waivers from his goal, helped along the way by Halle Berry as Jinx, Judi Dench as M, and John Cleese as the new Q.

Several things about this movie annoyed me.  I thought Madonna's role in the movie was okay (though others did not think so; read more below).  However, her song was annoying.  I would have to nominate Madonna's song in this movie as one of the worst Bond theme songs ever.  I was also displeased by the CGI used when Bond escapes from being drowned.  The escape looked like a video game, and was cheesy by Bond standards.  The escape should have been handled in a fashion that did not required animating Bond.

On the plus side, this movie had a lot of cool stuff.  The opening scene was filmed for real.  The surfers were taken out to the waves on jet powered wave runners which enabled them to ride the big waves.  The invisible car was a major coup for the film makers.  In fact, the military has been experimenting with techniques to make people and vehicles literally invisible for several years, and though they are well behind Q, one of the approaches is similar.

The CGI of the Icarus satellite was excellent; one of the best CGI spacecraft ever.  I enjoyed the car chase between Zao and Bond in the ice hotel.  In the making of features there is lengthy discussion of the changes that had to be made to accomplish the car chase.  I also enjoyed the fight scene in the laser room between Bond and Mr. Kil (Lawrence Makoare).  The robot and laser combination was a stroke of genius, and Halle Berry's peril appeared real.

Last, but not least, is the sword fight between Bond and Graves.  Most of the scenes were filmed with Brosnan and Stephens, a tribute to both men's abilities.

This movie edition also includes an array of extras on two discs.  There are commentaries, pictures, making of features, and much more.  I found it strange that some of the better features from the previous version were replaced with less valuable features.  What appears to be most noticeably missing is a feature listed on the box, the ""Ministry of Propaganda"" from the previous release.

This movie received an incredible 25 award nominations of all sorts from various organizations and countries, winning 5.  The only downside was the Razzie Award to Madonna for Worst Supporting Actress, and the Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song.  I think this may have been the Bond film with the most award nominations ever, and possibly the most award wins ever.

""Die Another Day"" marks 40 years of ""official"" Bond films.  Bond films are a microcosm of western technology, showing what we thought of as high-tech in five different decades.  I find it interesting that what we considered cutting edge in the early Bond films has been surpassed by what we have in our homes today.  I also find the changes in styles and mannerisms interesting as well.  Yet, through it all Bond remains suave and self-assured, seemingly invincible and with vast knowledge and capability.  While there are no real supermen of which we are aware, if there were such a being, Bond would have to be one.",1173657600,12,4415,4.66321243523316

1451619,2,B00005JLBE,"Even in a world full of hyperbole, calling this frankly rather shoddy downgrade an `Ultimate Edition' is taking liberties with the language that border on the actionable. Whereas the first 2-disc release of the 20th EON Bond film boasted a huge array of extras, this supposedly new and improved version drops nearly all of them and merely throws in a few scraps of filler instead. Gone is the 76-minute documentary `Inside Die Another Day,' replaced by a couple of shorter featurettes and some video footage of the location scout. And while the excellent 51-minute `Script to Screen' documentary on the difficult screenwriting process previously only available on the R2 DVD is retained along with the `Shaken and Stirred On Ice' featurette, gone are the storyboard-to-film comparisons, multi-angle action sequences, title design and digital grading featurettes, gadget briefings, music video and featurette and even the 8 TV spots a 3 theatrical trailers from the original issue to be replaced by an exotic locations featurette. With so many of the extras being dumped, it's a wonder that the film itself (in apparently exactly the same transfer as previously available) still contains the same audio commentaries and interactive featurettes it had first time round. Frankly, there's no reason whatever to buy this if you already have the original 2-disc release.

As for the film itself, Die Another Day seemed surprisingly impressive first time round but doesn't hold up well to a second viewing for a number of reasons - and not only because Daniel Craig and Casino Royale have taken the series to new heights since. Initially at least DAD seemed to be trying to make one of the series' periodic efforts to take itself more seriously. The pre-title sequence is particularly strong, and the film is plot-led with a good premise that it explores far more effectively than License to Kill - Bond screws up, gets captured and finds his license to kill revoked and has to go it alone. But too many wrong choices are made in the casting of those both in front of and behind the cameras to do it full justice.

Pierce Brosnan is certainly a major problem here, getting lazier in the role far sooner than his predecessors. He takes too much for granted and doesn't seem to be putting much effort into it in the assumption that he's got it down pat, when in reality he's starting to go to seed - certainly he must be the only man to come out of 14 months of torture in a Korean prison chubbier than when he went in, something his tendency to spend much of the opening of the film with his shirt off and hidden under a bushy Monty Python castaway beard only exacerbates.

He's not helped much by his co-stars either: Halle Berry, who seems to become a worse actress with each successive film, really can't handle sass or wisecracks, which is a shame since that's almost all her part consists of, and their initial meeting exchange of innuendoes seems more like eavesdropping a married man picking up a hooker to prove he's still got it than anything else. Rosamund Pike's other fatale femme fares a little better purely on he grounds that, while an extremely one-dimensional performer, to least her limited abilities fit the part. Toby Stephens' villain is a bigger problem. While it's a neat touch that he models himself on an unflattering portrait of Bond's vanity, Stephens actually seems to be basing his performance on Rik Mayall's caricatured MP Alan B'stard from Britcom The New Statesman, and the results aren't pretty - a largely ineffectual screen actor, it's no accident that he needs to don an electronic suit of armour to become a credible foe for Bond in the final punch-up. Curiously, two of the better performances on display come from bit-players John Cleese (pleasingly restrained) and Michael Madsen as a distinctly unimpressed company man. Even Madonna's unnecessary cameo as a lesbian fencing instructor is considerably less painful than her terrible title-song, easily the series' worst. Still, the resulting overly enthusiastic swordfight is okay but would probably have been even better had they hired William Hobbs to choreograph it instead of Bob Anderson (Anderson may have coached Errol Flynn, but only in some of his worst films).

The direction adds to the problems. Lee Tamahouri is a maddeningly variable director, and too often it's his weaknesses on display here. For a series that prides itself on globe-trotting, he has a very poor sense of place (aside from the Iceland scenes, this is the first Bond film that really looks like they were afraid to leave the studio backlot) and his handling of action isn't always effective - indeed, the car chase actually looks like several shots are missing. Still, at least they manage to just about get away with the science behind the invisible car more effectively than the awful CGI that undermines the series' reputation for doing daring stunts for real: along with the occasionally slo-mo or sped up scene intros, it just seems horribly out of place without ever quite ruining the film.

Another big problem is the tone. As the 20th entry in EON's series, the desire to celebrate its heritage threatens at times to overwhelm the film as it becomes increasingly self-referential. With almost every scene having an homage, a prop or an audio or visual reference to a previous movie, it stops being fun and becomes labored long before the halfway point. Bond is feeding off himself so much here that at times it reminds you of one of those animals that, when caught in a trap, gnaws its own leg off. It just about gets away with it, but it gets messy. There's fun to be had, most of it in the first half before it goes all Diamonds Are Forever, but there's still the feeling that this could and should have been much better.",1171238400,8,5796,4.856420626895854

I agree with another review on this page, the scene of Bond parasailing on a big wave is a joke and an embarrassment to Bond fans.

Halie Berry is as bad as it gets. Even though she looks good she is such a poor actress I can't enjoy watching her. Perhaps if she just kept her month shut it would work for me.

1451644,3,B00005JLBE,"After the critical disappointment (but hit nevertheless) that the World is Not Enough had, we know have Die Another Day, which is officially Pierce Brosnan's last performance as 007 with Daniel Craig replacing him in Casino Royale. Having watched Goldeneye first out of the 20 films out, there's a certain attachment I have to him as Bond but I still like Sean Connery's the best. It's kind of like people who see Christopher Reeve as Superman even though the older generation might actually say George Reeves. So how is Die Another Day? It's big explosive, dumb fun with bad one-liners but enough Bondness to make it a good entry in the series.

The World is Not Enough actually had for a series' first, a female villain (in fact she probably is the main one in that movie since Renard was kind of a pushover), Die Another Day also has a first: Bond captured. After infiltrating Korea, someone sells him out and he spends over a year in prison, tortured and interrogated. Eventually he gets released and being stripped of his 007 title and his license to kill, Bond seeks vengeance against Zao, the one responsible for his imprisonment. He eventually ends up in an ice-shaped palace and has to deal with another satellite-carrying madman as well as a sexy spy, well, 2 actually.

The Bond girls in the Brosnan era have been very hit until the previous entry when Denise Richards was cast. Would this film change it? Nope. We get Halle Berry, which odd as it may sound, I can't stand in anything, not even Monster's Ball. Why Bond would go out of his way to save her just boggles my mind, not to mention she has lines like ""read this, b****!"" Oddly, the film's best villain isn't even the main one so we get those total lame-o for the final villain. However, Rosamund Pike is my 2nd favorite Bond girl, oh-so-sexy but also having that kind of love-to-hate-her quality she needed. And let's face it: this film has Madonna in a really bad cameo. Ugh. Oh yeah, the theme song is absolutely terrible.

Hopefully Casino Royale will bring some perfect action scenes (personally that flip he has to do on his car to avoid that girl thrilled me more in the trailer than this entire film's action). The series always had some kind of credibility, as if somehow, that scene can happen. Here though it's as if the rules were thrown out and they just said ""go with it!"". Bond traverses a mindfield on a hovercraft, outruns a heat ray AND surfs the icy waves with a parachute AND takes his car right into the melting ice palace, and don't forget the airplane ending. In the special features, composer David Arnold comments that it's difficult to do a great Bond film since it's mainly just 20 great individual scenes over the series' run. This film feels similar: fun yet familiar, dumb but entertaining.

It's personally my pick for the worst of the Brosnan era but I wouldn't say it's a cinema blunder like Batman and Robin or Superman IV but instead it's merely, um, it reminds me of Batman Forever actually: pales in comparison to previous films yet if it came on TV (notably, Superstation), I'd end up watching it start to finish. Go figure.",1163376000,2,3133,4.619389587073608
1451645,4,B00005JLBE,"This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers and I give it 4 starts or 8/10. This is a 007 James Bond movie, with all the expectations on it like gadgets, fights, chases, and hot chicks. This time Bond fights the communists from North Korea with some help from the NSA (Berry). It is located in North Korea, England and Cuba. I am not a nostalgic, so I am not going to compare this 007 movie with the old ones, that seems to be a concern among the reviewers. This movie was the last Bond movie for Brosman, was shot in 2002, and to me it's a good movie.

It is true there is nothing new in this movie, but I do not think originality is something we are looking for in 007 movies. I particularly look for action, and this one has tons of it. Also, I like the gadget tricks, and there are plenty of them as well. Regarding the hot chicks, I can't think of any other hotter chick right now besides Halle Berry, whose presence in this movie justifies its price. Bond has another affair with another chick, but Berry takes care of her personally and teaches her how to read (on the plane: ""read this b*tch"".) This movie comes with a nice DVD case and a second DVD with lots of extras. DVD 1 also includes some audio commentaries that are always worth it. The sound in this movie will blow up your mind if you have Home Theatre system, which I do. I enjoyed it a lot. Overall, a very good movie to have lots of fun and very entertaining that I recommend to everyone (PG13).",1155945600,,1487,4.181184668989547
1451646,4,B00005JLBE,"Pierce Brosnan will go down thusly: the man who brought Bond back from the dead, and more simply, the best Bond since Sean Connery originated the part over 40 years ago.  As much as Brosnan has owned this role from day one, you can see how much more comfortable he is in the tux & cufflinks four pictures into his role as 007.

Die Another Day is EXACTLY what a Bond-movie is supposed to be-- especially with today's budgets for blockbusters.  There is the ever-dapper Brosnan as Bond; the bodacious Halle Berry as Jinx, babes abound (Rosamund Pike as well as Madonna in a cameo) & gadgets galore (now THAT is an Aston Martin).  There was NON-STOP action, multiple exotic locales & some cheeky one-liners.

In a nutshell, Bond goes after some villainous North Koreans creating serious weapons of mass destruction; gets double-crossed, imprisoned & tortured (nice touch, actually); gets his freedom at a huge price and sets out to avenge the trader who set him up.  That all happens in the first 15 minutes.  From North Korea to Hong Kong to Cuba to MI6 to Iceland & back, Bonds bests the bad guys with a little help from Berry to boot.  The action is throttled on full from the opening credits to the final conclusion.

There are a lot of winks to Bond's past, as Die Another Day came out 40 years after Connery's first turn in 1962s Dr. No.  So, for a Bond-historian, this movie will give you some silent chuckles if you know what to look for.  There are also nods to past Bond-movies.  Brosnan's Bond gets paired up with a Halle Berry's heroine as he did in 1997s Tomorrow Never Dies with Michelle Yeoh.  Do I need to mention Ursula Andress in here?!  The 00-revoked theme harkens back to Timothy Dalton's 1989 turn in License to Kill when Felix Leiter is murdered & Bond goes against MI6s orders to avenge his death.

The DVD is PACKED full of extras to enjoy-- commentary, videos, et al-- just what you'd expect from one of the big screens biggest legends.

I will end with a salute to Brosnan, whom I will be quite sorry to see vacate the role.  I grew up with Roger Moore as James Bond, so that was Bond to me.  I then watched Sean Connery as I grew my VHS & DVD collections over the years and quickly saw why Connery IS Bond.  Brosnan is second only to Connery's originality.  Brosnan brought life back into this franchise with a winner out of the box with 1995s GoldenEye.  I only wish Brosnan & the franchise could have reached agreement on a new contact for more pictures.  I will leave an open mind for Daniel Craig, but after 40+ years, 20 movies and our 6th Bond (not counting the ORIGINAL Casino Royale), I wonder if the Bond-aura will teeter off some without Brosnan's dashing presence.",1152230400,2,2701,4.491803278688525
1451647,3,B00005JLBE,"The name is Goldberg....RUBE Goldberg! This is EASILY the most gadget-ridden Bond film, hands down, of the entire series! It is also, alas, the second weakest Brosnan Bond by far, ahead of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", which I've never liked. Things are a little TOO fantastic here and there are far too many ""nods"" to earlier Bond films, (so many, in fact, that you can lose count!) for this to actually qualify as its own movie, even! You will recognize ""Dr. No"", ""Thunderball"", ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""You Only Live Twice"", ""The Living Daylights"" and others as this ""plot"" unwinds.

It's a complex ""plot"", too. Bond travels to North Korea, (not a great idea for a westerner these days,) to assassinate a crazed NK colonel who has been smuggling diamonds and generally screwing up the international scene with his shenanigans. To make a long story short and not to produce too many spoilers, Bond gets captured after a rousing chase involving hovercrafts and advanced artillery, gets tortured, released, forsaken by MI6, chewed out by ""M"" and again, as in ""Licence To Kill"" has to go renegade for the rest of the movie. Along the way, he meets a woman named ""Jinx"", played by Halle Berry, who also works for the West, and who is after the same North Korean colonel Bond is. They travel to Cuba, then to Iceland, get captured again, have some cutlery tete-a-tetes with the bad guys, run into double and triple crosses, find the true meaning of plastic surgery and get to use the most amazing Bond car ever conceived of.

Believe it or not, the Aston Martin used in this film is equipped with a CLOAKING device, fer cryin' out loud...something that would have the entire assembly of Bond-o-philes themselves going ""you're joking"", upon hearing this. Otherwise, it's just about as tricked out as Timothy Dalton's was in ""Daylights"". There's also a nod to Brosnan's run in ""Remington Steele"", as he walks up to spiffy hotel desk in Hong Kong and asks for ""his usual suite"" drenched to the bone, with long, scraggly hair and a beard, basically filthy. This is a straight steal from a scene in the two hour, fifth year ""Steele"" episode, ""The Steele That Would Not Die"".

Anyway, though it is witty, as usual, and though it's got some nice tense moments, this is easily the hokiest Bond film since Moore's laughable tenure as ""Suave, Joe Suave"". One of the things that was so refreshing about Dalton and Brosnan's Bond films is that they were TONS more realistic than all of Moore's and even Connery's later Bond films, (post ""Goldfinger"",) with relevant villains in post-cold war dust-ups or drug kingpin situations. This one harkens back to the bad-old days of ridiculous gadgetry, kaleidoscopic plots that owe too much to earlier movies and a general ""Bond-parody"" feel, rather than a genuine, glamorized espionage adventure.

You know, Ian Fleming's novels bore more of a resemblance to Len Deighton's or John Le Carre's work than they did to ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"" or Matt Helm. They really should have kept the ""realism renaissance"" going with this character.

Don't even talk to me about Daniel Craig.

1451648,4,B00005JLBE,"It is useless to state that after Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan has been the most charismatic Bond until the date. And this is probably the most realist Opus of his whole set of entries about 007. The script inside what Bond terminology represents has to do with the real menace that represents North Korea inside the geopolitical map.

This inner conflicts are far to be resolved, there are many involved and mingled issues to be discussed here. But this is the departure' s point to establish the rules of the game, in which hidden foreigner interests will be in struggle.

The visual feast will load the screen with impressive sequences of high caliber tension; the imaginative audacious, the fabulous special effects become a true parade of technological exhibition. And the brilliant inclusion of Halle Berry adds a major quote of dazzling talent and beauty. You will watch to Bond in an mesmerizing fencing' s duel, delirious car chases on the ice and an electrifying persecution of tanks in the first section of the film.

1451700,3,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" is a good James Bond movie, starring Pierce Brosnan. Also commendable is the performance of Halle Berry as Jinx, an American agent.

The movie starts with a bang when James Bond infiltrates into North Korea to assassinate an Army Colonel who is selling weapons on the black market. He is caught and spends many months in a notorious North Korean prison where he is subjected to intolerable torture. He eventually secures his freedom following a trade for a North Korean agent. The movie then unfolds into amazing feats by James bond which makes this an exciting movie.

One major weakness of the movie is the many computer generated special effects but these do little to diminish the marvelous performance by James bond.

This is a very good movie for those who have never seen the Bond series but if you have seen the series, you may be disappointed by some copycat scenes.",1144281600,,893,4.748387096774193
1451701,4,B00005JLBE,"Entertaining movie, though somewhat unbelievable in some parts.

1451703,5,B00005JLBE,"Some things just get better and better with age, examples would be wine, legends, rare trinkets, and even some movie franchises.  One movie franchise that would be a prime example of this statement would have to be the `James Bond' franchise.  After 19 movies, technically 20 if you count Sean Connery's final appearance in ""Never Say Never Again"" which occurs somewhat outside of the recognized 007 continuity.  In 2002 MGM went back to the well that just keeps on giving for what turns out to be the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as the suave secret agent in ""007:  Die Another Day"".

When one of his mission's gets sabotaged, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) finds himself in a rare predicament, captured and tortured for an extended period of time, and to top things off it appears that MI-6 has completely abandoned their top agent.  After M (Judi Dench) finally secures the release of 007, by swapping him for another prisoner, Bond uses his renewed freedom not to relax and heal, but to seek revenge on those that betrayed him.  Upon his reinstatement in the ranks of MI-6, Bond is given a chaperone to ensure that he cause as minimal trouble as possible.  Knowing that this chaperone will slow him down, Bond eventually strikes out on his own once again and follows his leads to the source of his betrayal.  With the help of an American spy (Halle Berry), Bond discovers that the person responsible for his mission's sabotage is a multi-billionaire whose business is diamonds; however, that is just a cover as his true business is that of terrorism as he is now in the possession of a devastingly powerful new weapon that could bring the world's superpowers to their knees.

After 21 total `James Bond' films in the franchise, one would think that there would really be nothing new the filmmakers could come up with.  Well, sometimes it's really nice to be surprised, because with ""007:  Die Another Day"" not only did the writers and the director, Lee Tamahori (director of ""xXx:  State of the Union"") deliver what could very well be one of the greatest `James Bond' adventures yet, but Pierce Brosnan also delivered his most powerful performance as the capable-as-ever Agent 007.  Sadly, as I stated earlier, this terrific entry into the franchise also served as the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  The reason this was Brosnan's final appearance isn't because he died or quit, it's because the producers of the franchise felt he no longer fit the part.  While I understand their reasoning to an extent, Brosnan was starting to show his age, and he did go out with one of the best installments in the long-lasting franchise.  But I would have liked to have seen him as Bond again, mostly because between him and Connery, they are the only two actors that I feel portrayed the character the best.  Anyways, back to the task at hand, other factors that assisted in making this one of the best `Bond' films ever is the raw emotions that are evoked throughout the story, the entire cast really did an amazing job, and the dramatic side of the story was well-paced, and the action served to propel the story for a change.  Another asset would have to be the perfectly cast Halle Berry as the new scantily clad, incredibly sexy Bond girl.  She is definitely enough to make any secret agent let all his secrets spill out.  Not to dote solely on Halle, the entire cast was excellent, and John Cleese as the new `Q' is just hilarious without being over the top or out of place in this franchise.

Well, as I've said numerous times in this review, this terrific entry into the `James Bond' franchise is definitely not one to be missed, especially by any of the fans of the series.  If you haven't ever gotten much out of this series of films, you should really give the franchise another chance, and make ""007:  Die Another Day"" one of the first on your list to see.

""007:  Die Another Day"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.",1140134400,7,3962,4.681096681096681
1451704,1,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is a big budget action movie with a spy named James Bond in it, however it is not a true 007 movie. In a disastrous attempt to get away from the formal image of 007 and appeal to younger viewers with a rough ""edgy"" character like the buffoonish XXX, Die Another Day presents us with a hard tough, angry James Bond character. Ironically the plan to make Bond more edgy takes away the sophistication, polish and refinement that gave James Bond/007 his edge for over 40 years and 19 movies. It's a sad day when Disney programs inspired by Bond like Kim Possible and The Incredibles treat the character with more respect than Albert Broccoli onscreen.

I knew the 007 franchise had been compromised by Hollywood when I saw James Bond surfing (kewl) XXX style then stepping out of a wetsuit on the beach of North Korea in a rumpled tan suit with a worried look on his face. Sorry folks, this is not the REAL 007, the calm cool confident guy of the previous 20 movies who smiles and laughs in the face of danger. With his cover blown, Fake blows up a case of diamonds in the face of General Zao and tries to make a getaway showing none of the creativity and resourcefulness he used in the past and is easily captured after seemingly killing Zao. Zao's Dad swears revenge on Bond and the movie stumbles through a boring torture sequence as the painful opening credits roll. Yes, the opening song is THAT horrible.

Cut to fourteen months later. A dirty bearded Bond is traded for the seemingly dead Zao in a prisoner exchange. On the boat back to the Falklands, Bond learns from M that he's betrayed the British government by giving out secret information. Knowing the truth and stripped of his 00 status (thank goodness) Bond fakes death and escapes then falls overboard to go on a misson to clear his sullied name (how ironic) and seek revenge on Zao. Fake swims to shore and walks into a hotel wet and unkempt and the hotel manager gives him the presidential suite. I puked a little inside writing that. The real Bond would never allow himself to be seen in public dirty and unshaven. He'd at least clean up before going to the hotel.

The movie then travels over to Cuba. Fake meets up with Jinx an NSA whose spy skills make the bumbling Ron Stoppable of Kim Possible look competent. Listening to the cartoonish dialogue used in their first meeting I got sick inside.. Instead of using the classic Bond. James Bond. tagline to introduce himself to her, Fake says ""My friends call me James Bond.""-Ugh. For me that was the equivalent of the scene in Batman & Robin where George Clooney pulled out the credit card. Most real 007/Bond fans have probably ejected the DVD at this point and have flung it out the window. But I had to keep watching to finish writing this review.

After bedding Jinx and getting some tips he heads to England to meet Gustav Graves, the real villain of the piece. From there on Die another Day just heads downhill. It stops being a spy movie and turns into a derivative clumsy action movie full of logic defying over the top sequences that make absolutely no sense. We learn that Graves and Zao have exchanged faces like in Face/Off and that's how Zao got the secret information. There's a dumb sequence at an ice palace. Jinx gets captured and tied to some laser device; Zao shows off his Icarus satellite and melts his ice palace. Jinx gets trapped in a melting ice room. Bond racing in his invisible car (groan) has a car chase with Graves all while Jinx is drowning. Miraculously after the car chase and killing Graves, Fake Bond has time to save the drowned Jinx and bring her back to life. This leads up to the final showdown on a Jetliner as Icarus is targeted to destroy HQ. Once Bond kills the traitor(s) and the escape plane blows up good, the movie ends with Bond bedding Jinx up in a sparsely furnished remote shack in China. I think I died a little on the inside watching Die Another Day.

Director Lee Tamahori disgraces James Bond's character the way Joel Schumacher disgraced the Batman character in Batman & Robin. His adaptation of Bond is a total mockery of Ian Flemming's character; a Bond who belongs in an episode of the abominable James Bond Jr. cartoon of the early 90's not in real 007 movies. Every single frame of this movie seems like it belongs in a poorly made Saturday morning cartoon. There isn't a single line in the script that isn't a clich, and the computer special effects used to cover for the horrible screenplay look so fake you can see the 0's and 1's of computer code.

Pierce Brosnan does his best but he clearly looks annoyed in a lot of frames. I think while working on this film he realized rogue agents in Hollywood have compromised the British agent; that's why he won't do any more Bond movies. Judi Dench looks like she's going to punch someone in the face if she has to read another line of this ridiculous script. Madonna is as bad as she ever was in her cameo appearance. Halle Berry just stands around and looks pretty; she adds no dimension and depth to the paper-thin Jinx character. Strange thing about Jinx: She actually has less time than all the characters in the story but is featured prominently on the DVD cover.

Avoid this garbage. Pick up North By Northwest, one of Sean Connery's classic Bond movies or Live and Let Die, Roger Moore's best film. To see Halle Berry in a good action movie, Pick up Executive Decision. To see Bond treated halfway with respect, Pick up a Kim Possible DVD or The Incredibles.",1139788800,7,5509,4.514028056112225
1451705,1,B00005JLBE,"I will not write an extensive review for a movie I dislike. And I disliked this movie.

However, I feel that this movie was such a letdown from other Bond efforts.  I liked 'Tommorrow Never Dies.'  But this movie went from interesting in the first few minutes to downright stupid.  Having Madonna act in the movie was the first unforgivable mistake.  The most agregious however was having Madonna perform the WORST Bond theme of them all.  Madonna - techno - acting - could you ask for a worse set of ideas?  The Broccoli's allowed this movie project to boil far too long!!

BOnd was supposed to be a thinking-man's hero.  I liked the cheesy over the top plots from the earlier eras.  But this movie turned into some sort of Vin Diesel vehicle.  Terrible CGI, and inane dialogue. The surf scene was cartoonish and it looked terrible.  Halle Berry seems out of place here - beautiful to be sure,  but out of place - much like Denise Richards.  I just didn't buy here as a US agent.

Frankly, this movie seemed liked it wanted to be a good movie, but it just didn't work.  I guess after Mike Myers has his way with Bond it is hard to take any movie seriously involving Mr. 007.  But c'mon, this was a real amatuerish effort.  I like Pierce Brosnan - I thought his work in 'Tailor of Panama' was more of the type of Bond movie I want to see.  This movie was so far from my expectations, I just have to say it really isn't terribly worth your time.  Too bad I wasted my time.

And finally, there is an invisible car at the end of the movie. What else needs to be said.

It looked as if Bond had finally left the old Soviet Cold War era and entered the 21 century fighting new enemies like North Korea. I loved the idea of having a crazy North Korea Colonel as a villain. Unfortunately, the plot quickly changed a half an hour into the movie and the villain magically became a British man who decided to create a satellite out of diamonds that shot heat rays at things.

The dialogue is horrible in this movie. There are so many puns that its almost hard to listen the movie at some points. I do not blame Brosnan or Berry though. Its not their fault that the lines in the movie were so poorly written. Even good actors can look bad when they are working with horrible dialogue.

1451708,1,B00005JLBE,"Die another day is a classic case of style over substance. This is a Bond movie for the MTV generation who cannot and will not watch a movie unless there are cheesy one liners,over the top stunts and about 3 scenes in every 4 are CGI.
While Bond movies have always had one liners, Brosnans are by far the worst, although nothing compares with Berrys ""Yo Momma"" line which earned her a place on my all time worst Bond girl list.
Brosnan was at his best in Goldeneye and by far at his worst in DAD. In Cuba he is obviously trying to look like some kind of cool sexual predator, but instead looks like a middle aged man who has moved to Cuba to evade child support payments. And what is with that squint he has? It's like he has blinding sunlight in front of him all the time and he can hardly see, although when your co-star is Halle Berry that is a good thing!
Lame villans, lame plot and an invisible car, just say it aloud and think about it folks, an invisible car. Bond movies always featured technology that was plausable, an invisible car belongs in mystery science theatre 3000, not a Bond movie.
If you are the kind of person who liked XXX, then by all means buy this dvd, you will probably enjoy it. But if you're the kind of person who enjoys a decent villan, non campy acting and a Bond girl who does't want to make you jump into the screen and gut her, then stick to every Bond movie up to Goldeneye.

1451709,1,B00005JLBE,"There have been some bad Bond films. Everything Dalton was in makes this catergory. But this awful film tops ANYTHING he could have starred in and fudged. Or better yet, MGM should have gone and got Dalton and saved Brosnan from wasting his time.

The film is CLASS-LESS. I sat in the theatre on release of this film and gritted my teeth as bond was TORTURED during the opening sequences!! Bond? Tortured? What's wrong with you writers!? Bond DOES NOT get tortured! He does not get interned in a North Korean camp and get beaten ALL THOUGH the AWFUL Madonna theme. Bond would get out of that through a witty comeback and some well-placed use of the furnature against his interners.

This film is CLASS-LESS because of Hali Berry. I will say it once: she is NOT beautiful. She is less pretty than Natalia in Goldeneye. Way less. Who gives a stuff what the fashion industry say, they only judge on body anyday: Hali's FUGLY. Now a pretty face like the Moonraker's Holly Goodhead, that's someone who is BOND GIRL material. And whatever happened to Victoria Beckham starring in one? With her on board, it might be worth borrowing the next Bond movie from a mate.

This film is CLASS-LESS because Hali Berry DOES too much. Women's lib is stuffed with even the production of a Bond film, let's not rub it in for all the guys who bother to go out and see it by saying 'Hey, let's make the lead male character REDUNANT, the same lead male in a film who seduces most of the women and then all too often leaves them to DIE'. That Chinese agent in Tomorrow Never Dies went too far already, Hali Berry's character should have just RUN the movie with her lack of cooperation with the main character. Whose this movie about, anyway?

This film is CLASS-LESS because some action scenes SUCK. Smashing valuble stuff with a sword isn't FUNNY, it's just immature and irresponsible (in Moonraker Bond was set upon in a Ventian glass museum and he was very reluctant to mindlessly attack the exhibits). Funny smashing was like Goldeneye though St Petersberg...riding along the road in a tank with a horse statue on top is funny.

This film is CLASS-LESS because the technology used can be bought in a toystore. I swear I saw thise things hanging off the rehabilitation-mask-thingy in the local toyshop and we used them in a Grade 3 drama production.

This film is CLASS-LESS because the technology used in the plot is lame. Moonraker, with its God-complex guy and biological warfare, is plausible.  Stealing money using a secret satelite is plausible from Goldeneye. Tomorrow Never Dies feels like a half-baked biography of Rupert Murdoch in many ways. But this film? Diamonds stuck in a guys face is just BAD wardrobe. A rehabilitation-mask-thingy to keep him alive with stuff stuck on the side that can be bought in toyshops is a joke. I mean, the idea of putting diamond sattelite coordinates on a notoriously unreliable cassette tape is more plausible than the plot in Die Another Day. And that is really saying something.

The making of this film was the first piece of evidence that MGM had lost the plot- litterally. Dumping Brosnan and casting a blonde, the second.

ONE OF THE BEST BOND FILMS EVER-Chicago Sun-Times

This movie is really good. It has action and alot of excitement. This James Bond movie is good. Anybody a fan of it, should see it RIGHT NOW!

  IMAGE:

The 2.40:1 anamorphic image transfer is a wonder to behold. The overall aesthetic is pristine, appearing smooth and lifelike throughout. The opeining sequence boasts an intentoinally cold and subdued color palette, consising of cooll,bluish tones that are nicely contrasted by the warm, vibrant hue evident later in the film. The picture conveys a commendable level of detail with a soothing touch of film grain that adds significantly to the film-like appearance. The only distraction is a noticeable amount of edge enhancement. While easily detectable,its presence is never bothersome enough to detrack from the sheer splendor of this winning transfer.

  SOUND:

Attention audio fanatics:prepare to be dazzled. The outstanding Dolby Digital and DTS soundtracks both feature 6.1 matrix processing,allowing those with rear surround capability the option to become completely immersed in audio nirvana. Being able to apply this technology, I was amazed by the robust energy generated from the rear soundfield. I did feel,however,that the format is underplayed a bit. While the rear speaker certainly helps tighten the sense of 360-degree imaging,I felt as if the sound designers were somewhat reserved in fully utilizing the back surround speaker. Nevertheless,this is an insignificant gripe for what is otherwise a supreme soundtrack. Whil the Dolby Digital EX track is excellent, the DTS-ES reigns superior with a more neutral high end,warmer mid-range and tighter,deeper bass. Both tracks feature aggressive split surrounds during the many action sequences,enceloping the viewer with the surrounds of speeding vehicles and crackling gunfire. Perhaps the most impressive element of the soundtrack is the natural tonal quality of the dialogue,particularly on the DTS track. Spoken words possess an incredibly warm characterustuc,sounding so clear and natural that I could close my eyes and believe that the actors and I were in the same room. Delivering a brilliant display of the 6.1 matrix format and featuring perhaps the finest fidelity I have heard thus far on DVD,the Die Another Day DTS-ES soundtrack is unquestionably my new demo matrial.

1451759,3,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was surprisingly impressive first time round but doesn't hold up well to a second viewing for a number of reasons. The pre-title sequence is particularly strong, and the film is plot-led with a good premise that it explores far more effectively than License to Kill - Bond screws up, gets captured and finds his license to kill revoked and has to go it alone. But to many wrong choices are made in the casting of those both in front of and behind the cameras to do it full justice.

Brosnan is certainly a major problem here, getting lazier in the role far sooner than his predecessors. He takes too much for granted and doesn't seem to be putting much effort into it in the assumption that he's got it down pat, when in reality he's starting to go to seed - certainly he must be the only man to come out of 14 months of torture in a Korean prison chubbier than when he went in, something his tendency to spend much of the opening of the film with his shirt off and hidden under a bushy Monty Python castaway beard only exacerbates.

He's not helped much by his co-stars either: Halle Berry, who seems to become a worse actress with each successive film, really can't handle sass or wisecracks, which is a shame since that's almost all her part consists of, and their initial meeting exchange of innuendoes seems more like eavesdropping a married man picking up a hooker to prove he's still got it than anything else. Rosamund Pike's other fatale femme fares a little better purely on he grounds that, while an extremely one-dimensional performer, to least her limited abilities fit the part. Toby Stephens' villain is a bigger problem. While it's a neat touch that he models himself on an unflattering portrait of Bond's vanity, Stephens actually seems to be basing his performance on Rik Mayall's caricatured MP Alan B'stard from sitcom The New Statesman, and the results aren't pretty - a largely ineffectual screen actor, it's no accident that he needs to don an electronic suit of armour to become a credible foe for Bond in the final punch-up. Curiously, two of the better performances on display come from bit-players John Cleese (pleasingly restrained) and Michael Madsen as a distinctly unimpressed company man. Even Madonna's unnecessary cameo as a lesbian fencing instructor is considerably less painful than her terrible title-song, easily the series' worst. Still, the resulting overly enthusiastic swordfight is okay but would probably have been even better had they hired William Hobbs to choreograph it instead of Bob Anderson (Anderson may have coached Errol Flynn, but only in some of his worst films).

The direction adds to the problems. Lee Tamahouri is a maddeningly variable director, and too often its his weaknesses on display here. For a series that prides itself on globe-trotting, he has a very poor sense of place (aside from the Iceland scenes, this is the first Bond film that really looks like they were afraid to leave the studio backlot) and his handling of action isn't always effective - indeed, the car chase actually looks like several shots are missing. Still, at least they manage to just about get away with the science behind the invisible car more effectively than the awful CGI that undermines the series' reputation for doing daring stunts for real: along with the occasionally slo-mo or sped up scene intros, it just seems horribly out of place without ever quite ruining the film.

Another big problem is the tone. As the 20th entry in EON's series, the desire to celebrate its heritage threatens at times to overwhelm the film as it becomes increasingly self-referential. With almost every scene having an homage, a prop or an audio or visual reference to a previous movie, it stops being fun and becomes labored long before the halfway point. Bond is feeding off himself so much here that at times it reminds you of one of those animals that, when caught in a trap, gnaws its own leg off. It just about gets away with it, but it gets messy. There's fun to be had, most of it in the first half before it goes all Diamonds Are Forever, but there's still the feeling that this could and should have been much better.

The extras package is superb, but strangely ommits the 50-minute documentary about the writers' struggle with the script that is on the UK disc.",1131926400,,4324,4.752330226364847
1451760,4,B00005JLBE,"In 2002 Pierce Brosnan returned for the fourth and final time as James Bond, in the twentieth official Bond film. I enjoyed this film more than ""The World Is Not Enough,"" but less than ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" I find it interesting that so many Bond fans dislike this movie so much. There are things about this movie to dislike, but this movie has as much going for it as the other Bond movies with a strong science fiction flavor, and perhaps more than some.

This Bond movie begins with Bond penetrating North Korea. However, something goes wrong and North Koreans capture Bond. During the opening credits we see bits and pieces as Bond is tortured and Madonna sings a song from her electronic period (can we say ""yuck?""). Soon after the credits are finished Bond is traded for diamond decorated Zao (Rick Yune). Bond is not pleased that he was traded, but is even less pleased that he is being considered a traitor. Bond is not one for waiting for things to happen, so he escapes from custody to discover that he is in Hong Kong.

Bond slowly discovers that Zao and Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) are somehow linked. Gustav demonstrates the Icarus solar satellite in Iceland, both for its ostensible purpose (providing light in dark regions of the world when needed) and for a far more nefarious purpose. Bond never waivers from his goal, helped along the way by Halle Berry as Jinx, Judi Dench as M, and John Cleese as the new Q.

Several things about this movie annoyed me. I thought Madonna's role in the movie was okay (though others did not think so; read more below). However, her song was annoying. I would have to nominate Madonna's song in this movie as one of the worst Bond theme songs ever. I was also displeased by the CGI used when Bond escapes from being drowned. The escape looked like a video game, and was cheesy by Bond standards. The escape should have been handled in a fashion that did not required animating Bond.

On the plus side, this movie had a lot of cool stuff. The opening scene was filmed for real. The surfers were taken out to the waves on jet powered wave runners which enabled them to ride the big waves. The invisible car was a major coup for the film makers. In fact, the military has been experimenting with techniques to make people and vehicles literally invisible for several years, and though they are well behind Q, one of the approaches is similar.

The CGI of the Icarus satellite was excellent; one of the best CGI spacecraft ever. I enjoyed the car chase between Zao and Bond in the ice hotel. In the making of features there is lengthy discussion of the changes that had to be made to accomplish the car chase. I also enjoyed the fight scene in the laser room between Bond and Mr. Kil (Lawrence Makoare). The robot and laser combination was a stroke of genius, and Halle Berry's peril appeared real.

Last, but not least, is the sword fight between Bond and Graves. Most of the scenes were filmed with Brosnan and Stephens, a tribute to both men's abilities.

This movie edition also includes an incredible array of extras on two discs. There are two commentaries, a ""pop-up"" sort of extra feature that explains details of scenes, dozens of pictures, numerous making of features, and much more. The only extra that I found a little disappointing was the audio commentary by Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who played agent Miranda Frost). In all the other audio commentaries I have heard where two people are involved the people interact. It was apparent to me that the commentaries of Brosnan and Pike were recorded separately, and thus the comments are independent snippets that I sometimes found annoying.

This movie received an incredible 25 award nominations of all sorts from various organizations and countries, winning 5. The only downside was the Razzie Award to Madonna for Worst Supporting Actress, and the Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song. I think this may have been the Bond film with the most award nominations ever, and possibly the most award wins ever.

""Die Another Day"" marks 40 years of ""official"" Bond films. Bond films are a microcosm of western technology, showing what we thought of as high-tech in five different decades. I find it interesting that what we considered cutting edge in the early Bond films has been surpassed by what we have in our homes today. I also find the changes in styles and mannerisms interesting as well. Yet, through it all Bond remains suave and self-assured, seemingly invincible and with vast knowledge and capability. While there are no real supermen of which we are aware, if there were such a being, Bond would have to be one.",1130544000,4,4637,4.693726937269373
1451761,1,B00005JLBE,"I'm being sarcastic, so I hope you noticed. I never was a big Bond fan. They're all the same thing basically, Bond meets girl, Bond beats up bad guys, Bond is invincible. These movies really demonstrate the same invincibility tis man has. But, here we've gone too far. To call this movie unrealistic is unfair. It is the father of unrealism. There are maybe only two Bonds that are 5 star babies to me and this ain't one. It was in the ""so called classics"" that some were good. I say some. But, some of Connery's were great action flicks that you've gotta love. This movie is pathetic. It has Bond doing the usual but in horrible fashion. We see him go to prison, get his but kicked for what purpose? We all know he's going to live! Then he shows us that he is a master fencer (?), great with women, great with cars, great with guns, great with everything. Everyone would love to be this guy. I mean he survives the sun (which was somehow controlled?!?! I mean am I an idiot? Isn't that a little too unrealistic and absurd?!)jumps off a cliff making a parachute somehow and then using a little platform to surfboard in HUGE waves! What this? Sounds similiar to that idiotic scene at the start of Batman and Robin where they surfboard in mid air?! I guess so!

So, if you like Bond and want to watch him do the same thing for the billionth time, then watch this pathectic movie, but if you're like me and want to see actually a good movie, then don't watch this horrid movie!",1130198400,3,1474,4.340579710144928
1451762,5,B00005JLBE,"Although Sean Connery defines James Bond Pierce Brosnan refines the character to perfection. He adds so well to the character via his mannerisms. In this installment he extended his role superbly. Who doesnt want to be James Bond? A man in a suit swooning women wether ally or foe with intellect, skills and looks but yet deadly if necessary. However, I must add that Halle Berry as a Bond girl was excellent she definitely should play further roles in the Bond series her beauty and talent complimented her well.

 Die Another Day was a great creation, excellent use of the gadgets especially the Aston Martin (The perfect Bond car) and fight scenarios. It was also great how they showed a tribute to past James Bond films. Who could now ever forget Halle Berry rising and exiting the water like a butterfly, a beautiful transmogrification on the scene with Ursula Andress in Dr No. Small flaw in the CGI for the scene in which Bond evades death by wind surfing but otherwise the picture won me over.

 Other espionage pictures have not challenge Bond in its deliverance of excitement so far. I wish further creations of Bond could keep that winning combination of actors, actresses etc. that it utilise so effectively in Die Another Day.",1129766400,,1239,4.775700934579439
1451763,1,B00005JLBE,"To add to my collection, I bought the latest Bond DVD, got home, and popped the sucker into the DVD player... only to have to stop it 45 minutes into it (I finished it a few days later). The first half hour is pure trash, and only gets slightly better.

My major complaints are as follows: *What's the deal with the first half hour??? *the ""blue screen"" shots were done better in the early films; they are so incredibly noticeable in this film. *Diamond-face-man... come on; poor villian and poor makeup job. *The special effects are not up to par with what could have been done. Some of the explosions are good, but other things are just too cheesy looking. *TOO unrealistic, even for a Bond film. Bond would have been dead ten times over... after awhile, I was actually hoping he'd die, just to give me some satisfaction.

I didn't care about the characters (including Bond), the one-liners (they were extra bad in this one- not even funny the way they're supposed to be), and the story was poor.

In my opinion, this is the worst film in the James Bond video library. 3/10",1129507200,10,1075,4.5025641025641026
1451764,5,B00005JLBE,"I really love the story, Die Another Day stands out for a Bond movie.  The first time he was captured, tortured, and detained for months. Judy Dench plays ""M"" in the lastest Bond.  She thinks he's damaged good because how long he was a P.O.W.  So he goes all out to prove he's loyal to England.  Bond cuts corners as he does and finds out that he's not alone on this mission. Halle Berry is the new CIA agent, Jinx, who's character was born on Friday the 13th.  She does a excellent job and appearing on the beach; remaking a scene from Dr. No.

  The plot of this Bond story is about the bad guys having  gene manipulation.  The story starts off in North Korea where you see the double 0's surfing.  Yeah surfing!  I know what you thinking Bond surfing, well he is a Naval officer.  He assumes someone identity to stop the Koreans from trading Blood Diamonds.  He gets captured and tortured for about 14 months.  He was traded and released to MI6 but he looses his double O status.(i know he looses his double 0 licence to kill status a lot) He escapes heads for Cuba and the story takes off from there.  The story has a lot of tributes to the previous Bond movies. The movie have scenic locations especially the ice palace.  I think this is the best of Brosnan as James Bond.",1129420800,,1277,4.298319327731092
1451765,3,B00005JLBE,"What do you get when you sink all your money into special effects and nothing into the plot or writing?  You get ""Die Another Day.""  While the movie is tolerable, it has got to be one of the worst Bond movies ever.  We're talking Timothy Dalton bad.  I understand the bond movies are a formula and there have been some really good Bond movies, this just isn't one of them.  If you are a Bond fan or collector of Bond movies then I say go ahead and get this, otherwise rent it if you want to see it.",1129248000,,498,4.040816326530612
1451766,4,B00005JLBE,"I really like Bond movies, I started watching them since Pierce Bronsan started off as Bond in ""Golden Eye"", sad to here Bronsan want be in the next Bond movie.  He quoted "" I believe myself to be too old to play Bond"".  I really wish he would have atleast stayed for one more Bond movie, sadly that want be the case, unless miricles happen.  Anyway, I have all four Bond DVD's leading up to this one, and I'm glad I bought them.  To me its worth adding to your collection.

I do agree with one or two of the earlier reviews, the end seem to be not as good as the first and somewhat the middle part.  But it wasn't all that bad.  I gave this movie (4) stars because its not perfect, but its pretty dang close.  I reccommend you buying this DVD if your a close to or a die hard fan of Bond movies.  Its worth adding to your collection...",1129161600,,836,4.048780487804878
1451827,3,B00005JLBE,"007 movies are a way to have a good time, with all those gadgets he has, the action and the ladies and of course the places they go. But this movie it's not as good as others of 007. Think that Cuba has those medical resources it's ridiculous, by the way, the scenes of Cuba were made in Cadiz, Andalucia, Spain. The only reason to watch this movie is Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike, are so beautiful. I think 007 movies are over.",1126310400,,429,4.180722891566265
1451828,2,B00005JLBE,"The final Pierce Brosnan performance of James Bond will ultimately be described as a film that crumples under the weight of its own silliness.  No, I don't expect a Bond film to be realistic - in fact this installment gives us exactly what we want in these films for about the first hour.  There's nifty gadgets, perhaps the most beautiful of all Bond women ever (in Halle Barry), and lots of stuff blows up real good.  Unfortunately, by the time the first hour has gone by, we've seen all the neat stuff and the logic gets ever fuzzier as the effects just get louder and more computer animated, rather than more exciting.

A quick perusal of the Bond DVD's shows that this one averages the lowest score on Amazon's site.  I don't know if that's fair - when this film works, it works very well.  Obviously Barry is a skilled actor and she brings a little extra zip to her role as a CIA assassin.  For my money, Pierce Brosnan is the greatest Bond (yes, better than Connery) in terms of his acting performance.  No one does the suave, sexually-charged secret agent better.  Even Madonna puts in a good performance as a fencing instructor, and gets to trade a couple nice innuendos with Brosnan.

Unforunately, it is typical of this movie that the two best sequences - the three surfing secret agents and a ""car"" chase between hovercraft - are before the opening credits.  What do we get in the rest of the film?  Lasers.  Over and over again.  There's a giant one in space threatening to incinerate bond.  There's a smaller one threatening to decapitate the immobilised Jinx (Barry's character).  There's a fist-fight between Bond and a lacky with lasers whizzing about the room.  We've seen these scenes before in previous Bond films.  There is a fine line between homage and self-plaigerism that this film does not quite understand.  More distressing is the repetition within the film itself: if you're going to have a climactic sword-fight between the two women at the end of the film, you should not have a longer and more interesting sword-fight between Bond and his main adversary earlier in the film.  Likewise, the opening surfing scene is repeated as Bond has to surf a ""tidal"" wave to escape a predicament (and the second scene, mainly computer animanted, looks cartoonish compared to the real surfers on real waves in the first scene).

And that's not even taking into account the absurdity of the plot.  No, we don't go to a Bond film to find intricately woven and realistic international politics.  And in a better film, people wouldn't question the plot points.  But this film doesn't really earn the right to gloss over the plot.

But if you must buy this DVD, you will be pleased with the quality of the extras.  There are two audio commentaries, some scene breakdowns, Madonna's video of the theme song, and even a making-of featurette on that music video!  The picture is good, as expected, and the sound on my (admitedly primitive) system is also good.",1125446400,,2970,4.705426356589148

1451830,1,B00005JLBE,"Easily the worst Bond movie Ever. After watching 'Tomorrow Never Dies', I stopped watching Bond movies. Saw parts of this movie.

Please bring back the cold hearted version of Bond potrayed in Dr. No. Please bring back the sophistication of Sean Connery. Bring back the humor of Roger Moore.

I wan't some degree of realism in a Bond movie. I don't want to watch a cartoon. All Bond movies since ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" simply seem to be a sequence of action scenes and nothing else.",1125014400,2,481,4.647058823529412

Bronsas looks bored with the role and he is just doing it for a paycheck.  The bond women in this film were not interesting and not very sexy at all.  They were in the line of trying to dominate than anything.  The actions is ok, but not great.  The locations are excellent, that's what keeps this film interesting.  Also, the greatest point and giving it two starts is that Madonna was in the film.  I own this on DVD and I don't even hardly watch it. I am glad the Bronsan is retiring as bond, he is getting to old anyway.  He was good in Goldeneye and lost interest in the other three.",1124928000,3,731,4.239130434782608

Anyway, turns out that our DVD player works just fine, and I ended up watching the whole movie. I'm a Pierce Brosnan fan, as you know, so that part was just fine. And it was your standard James Bond fare. Fast cars and faster women, cool toys, sexy villains, etc., etc., etc. I hate to see P. Bros reduced to such horrible scripts, but it was very James Bond-y, so I can't really fault him I guess. Halle Barry was very cute and, oh, there was an ice palace, so that was neat.",1124668800,,792,3.9874213836477987
1451833,4,B00005JLBE,"While on a mission in North Korea, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is betrayed by an unknown informant and imprisoned there. When he is released in exchange for a North Korean agent, he is suspected by his own intelligence service of having divulged sensitive information, and his ""00"" status is rescinded. Bond sets out to find the person who betrayed him by way of finding the North Korean terrorist who was traded for him. His search leads him to Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens), a publicity crazed diamond magnate whose gemstones are of suspect origin. Following the same trail is a beautiful American agent named Jinx (Halle Barry). Graves invites all the relevant parties to his Ice Palace in Iceland for the grand unveiling of ""Icarus"", a new satellite technology which will allow the sun's light to be focused anywhere on Earth at any time. James Bond and Jinx must discover Grave's true identity and purpose, find the mole who has compromised their agencies' security, and prevent Icarus from being used as a weapon of mass destruction.

""Die Another Day"" celebrates the 40th anniversary of James Bond films by placing little references to Bond history in the movie: Jinx' first appearance closely resembles that of Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No"". Some of Bond's old gadgets reappear in Q's storage room. And I'm sure there were a lot of references that I missed., but this homage to past Bonds is neither fulfilling nor distracting. ""Die Another Day"" does quite well on its own and joins the list of thoroughly entertaining Brosnan Bonds, carrying on the somewhat modernized traditions of this great franchise. The action sequences are creative, original and entertaining. The ""Bond girls"" are actually very pretty. Halle Barry is a pleasure to watch as the plucky Jinx. And Rosamund Pike does a nice Ice Princess as Gustav Grave's publicist. Carrying on a long tradition, there are a lot of new half-plausible, half-science fiction technologies that look really neat, anyway. ""Die Another Day"" is a special effects-driven movie, in contrast to Sean Connery's more character-driven Bonds. But, ironically, Pierce Brosnan's modern Bond is less of a super hero and more of a man than Connery's. This is particularly evident in ""Die Another Day"". We see Bond's vunerability...which he then uses his charming personality, skill and great determination to overcome. A solid, well-paced, entertaining Bond.",1123545600,,2399,5.135549872122762

The two and half hours on this movie are definantly a waste as James Bond seduces girl after girl, and tries to capture a man who is as poor an enemy as he is spy.

I thought the movie was full of acting, acting you can tell is acting which made the movie longer. Besides, the chase scenes where just as boring. The hover crafts promised to be cool, but only managed to become drab and uninteresting after the first five minutes.

In short, James Bond will never win my heart nor my vote of popularity in this review.

1451918,2,B00005JLBE,"I've always felt bad for Pierce Brosnan: never before has an actor been so well-groomed for a part before.

His late wife, who appeared in 1981's FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (she was the woman run down by a dune buggy on the beach), started pushing him into the role early on.

By the time Moore called it quits in 1985's A VIEW TO A KILL, everyone just knew that Pierce would become the next 007...and then all the press inched the ratings up for ""Remington Steele"" and he was forced to do another season and see the role go to Timothy Dalton.

While the Bond filmmakers duked it out in court for the next five years or so following 1989's LICENSE TO KILL, Brosnan was not only free to slip into the tux, but he'd toughened his image by playing in thrillers like THE FOURTH PROTOCOL (a cool movie, by the way, if you haven't seen it).

So I was thrilled when he finally got his title shot with 1995's GOLDENEYE.  It's still his best Bond film.

Unfortunately, the scripts dried up after that.  And it's too bad, because Brosnan is a very talented actor who could take the role in just about any direction they'd want to go.

Another disappointing part of the last several films is that they look more like video games than real movies.  The girls in the opening titles are clearly CGI (which is kind of hard to get too excited by when you know they're fabrications).

And the action sequences are far from thrilling since you know they're done on a computer as well.  During the finale of DIE ANOTHER DAY, I kept looking for the joystick in front of me or buttons to push.

If you get a chance, go back and find the Special Edition DVDs of earlier Bond films and watch the Making Of specials--back when real stunt men jumped speedboats or ran across the backs of alligators (LIVE AND LET DIE), ski off a sheer cliff and parachute down (THE SPY WHO LOVED ME), or wrestled for a parachute while plummeting to earth (MOONRAKER).

Even the cameraman hanging under a helicopter to shoot the ski chases in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE looked like a secret agent in danger!

It's just been announced that it looks like Pierce will appear after all in the next Bond film, CASINO ROYALE.

Despite some new wrinkles to the rather tired 007 formula, the reliance on computer-generated effects makes the film look like a cartoon. Pierce Brosnan remains a solid Bond, with a memorable assist from Halle Berry as Jinx. However, the actors and director Lee Tamahori are shortchanged by a weak script. ""Die Another Day"" offers some nice homages to previous Bond films, but cannot escape the overall sense of deja vu.

Surely, when Bond is skiing away from thirty people down a slope, avoiding hundred of bullets from automatic weapons, we grin and inwardly accept that this is outside the bounds of reality, but it's not so far out that one shudders utterly.  A lot of Bond is like that, and we're okay with it, but this movie went beyond the veil in this regard.  We're given DNA shapeshifters and invisible cars.  We're shown a weapon of impossible, unrealistic power and gadgets that upstage the movies plot and characters entirely.

After watching all the Pierce Browsnan Bond movies before this one, I thought that he gets better (and older) everytime! Another reason that I watch it because of the rare gadgets that Q always produces and this time is a big one! A ____________ car! (gotta find that out yourself)

In the twentifth movie, James gets himself caught by his enemy and tortured for a year and a half. After the MI6 trades in a ""person"" in return for Bond, Bond found himself unwanted back in the headquarters in Britain. Making up the decision that he is going to find out who ""betray"" him, he escaped the headquarters and on the road to search for any guilty people that he think that is the one who did all the dirty work. On the way on his own mission, he met Jinx (played by Halle Berry), another secret agent, as he soon discovers---together they went on to solve the mystery of a suddenly-rich diamond miner, which James thinks have something to do with his case. After MI6 finally agreeing with him, Q (John Clesse)provided great technology equipement for him which, of course, saves his neck. The actions goes from surfing on a surfboard to a magnificent car chase to escaping of a crashing plane!

Brosnan captures the essence of Bond perfectly, so much so that if this really is his last go-round in the role it'll be very difficult to find anyone better fitted to the part.  Halle Berry, beautiful and dangerous, is terrific in the role of Jinx, and the relationship between she and Bond is more convincing than most of the previous romances from the series.  Much of the credit for this movie's great success lies with the surprisingly literate script, which is not only chock full of zinging dialogue and crackling action but has the guts to open with Bond's capture, imprisonment, and torture.  The scenes in the North Korean dungeon are surprisingly strong, more like what you'd find in the Bond novels than the generally lighter movies.  The story also incorporates a dramatic father-son dynamic that, while a minor plot point, greatly enriches the story (and is, I think, the sort of thing Ian Fleming would've run with). There are a couple of weak points--one of Bond's escape scenes is dubious at best (one wonders why he didn't use the same trick much earlier in the movie if it's THAT easy), Madonna's cameo is annoying (but mercifully brief), and Judi Dench, while a great actress, is of such unadulterated political correctness in her role as ""M"" that it remains hard to swallow. Nonetheless, DIE ANOTHER DAY delivers all the goods in spades and may be one of the most scintilating adventures in the Bond canon.

Aside from the atrocious speaking gaffe, there are other problems with this debacle of a film. There are so many, but this reviewer will mention only a few. The (U.S.) C.I.A. does not, indeed can not, order the Republic of Korea's armed forces to do anything. The farms in the R.O.K. are now plowed by motourised tractors, not mules! And Iceland is not all that icy; instead, Greenland is.
This installment vies with ""A View to a Kill"" (1985) as the worst James Bond 007 movie(s) of all time. After V/K with Roger Moore, the franchise somehow managed to continue, with ""The Living Daylights"" (1987) and ""The World is not Enough"" (1999) marking the high points. On balance, though, this series most likely has at long last run its course, for the bulk of the movies that came out after the ascension of Gorbachev (remember him?) in the then-U.S.S.R. are indistinguishable from all the other action-oriented films. May Bond rest in peace.",1105401600,3,1183,4.803921568627451
1451996,4,B00005JLBE,"When it comes to big round numbers, the Bond film franchise has plenty to spare. Anywhere else the number 20 might not qualify as being very large, but when you're talking about the number of movies in a series, it's the biggest. That's right, in 40 years the Bond series has racked up 20 different films. This probably also qualifies it as the largest money maker, however I don't have a total for that. In that time the series has only gotten better, with the possible exception being the dreaded Timothy Dalton years. Brosnan is in my opinion second only to Moore is his portrayal of the ""secret"" agent 007. Both have the right look, but Moore surpasses Brosnan in his faint self awareness of the ridiculous character he is playing. Moore manages just the right blend of serious action with sardonic humor. The ability to pull off some of the most daring stunts in the history of cinema while wearing a tuxedo and without breaking a sweat, wooing a beautiful female Russian double agent into bed, and exchanging countless witty double entendres is no simple task. Brosnan is almost there, though he has obviously chosen to take a more serious approach to Bond than Moore.

The plot is this: While on a mission Bond is captured and then held and tortured for over a year in a North Korean prison camp. He is freed in a prisoner exchange only to be rejected by the MI6 organization fearing that he has either been brainwashed, leaked information, or both. Bond must prove himself trustworthy once again before dealing with the bigger threat. That threat being no less than a satellite capable of reflecting and focusing the sun into a powerful and deadly energy beam capable of zapping just about anything down on the earth. It appeared to be part of a diabolical plot of the North Koreans to bum rush the DMZ into South Korea and then presumably the rest of the plant. Scary huh?

Of course the good guy's single lame attempt to take out this killer satellite was to fire a single rocket at it which was quickly shot down by the energy ray. No attempt was made to simply fire multiple weapons at it from different locations. I am very disappointed in our government for this poor showing! How did the North Koreans manage to build and launch this cool weapon right under out noses? Even more disappointing - when did the Koreans surpass the US in killer satellite technology? We have no such orbital weapon platform despite spending over a decade and billions of dollars on the Strategic Defense Initiative.

Overall this is a fine Bond film with plenty of action and interesting twists and turns. Halle Berry is as lovely a Bond girl as I can imagine, and is also a capable action star. The plot is typical of the series, although a little murky in parts. For instance, a major focus of much of the action is the ""African Conflict Diamonds"" though no explanation is offered to the audience. I learned later that they are black market diamonds illegally mined in African war zones that actually do fund many real life terrorist organizations and dictator regimes.

I was a little disappointed in some of the special effects in the film. In one scene Bond is riding a makeshift parasail/surfboard down a collapsing glacier face and then into the resulting ocean waves and quite frankly it looked terrible. I can't be sure, but the unnatural motion of Bond in the sequence just appeared to be either shoddy miniature work or maybe some really poor CGI effect. Another disappointment, the film succumbs to using several Matrix style action shots and fight sequences including several floating camera shots, ""bullet time"" shots, and time manipulations. I dare say every single action film since the Matrix has been unduly influenced by it, and becomes unoriginal and derivative in the process. The types of effects used in the Matrix worked well for that film because they were integral to that films very particular storyline. They are not universally applicable to every action sequence ever to be filmed for the rest of time.

Speaking of CGI, I was surprised to learn that this is the very first Bond film to use computer generated special effects along with the usual outrageous stunts and other photographic techniques. And it appears to have been restricted to only one or two scenes. Resisting the CGI temptation surely was not easy for the director and producers and I applaud them for it. No matter what Lucas and Spielberg think, the audience is not fooled by entire scenes composed on Sun workstations. Many of the stunts in Bond films are truly awe inspiring - the audience simply can't believe what they just saw on the screen because it continues to look so real, at least real in the sense that physical objects actually make up the scene. You simply do not get such an effect from the computer, maybe someday, but not yet.",1101859200,,4837,4.719526627218935

1451998,3,B00005JLBE,"Being a fan of the Fleming novels, For Your Eyes Only, the first two Connery Bond films, and Timothy Dalton's impressive performance, I was hooked by the grittiness of the pre-credits teaser.  I really thought that the producers wanted to get away from the bad-campy knee-slap-in-angst atrocious diarrhea-ridden rubbish of the previous Brosnan-as-Bond (thereafter known as ""Brosnobond"" films).

As the movie progressed, the movie changed from an ideal Fleming-like thriller'n'chiller back into typical Brosnobond drivel:  Supervillain with a superhuman ability that never gets used to good effect (this time around, the baddie doesn't sleep, which in of itself is hardly interesting, never mind the fact they never use this great anomaly to any worthwhile (or simply any) use), idiotic gadgets, and the most contrived stunts ever thought of (many of which I'm sure the early 80s and equally brainless 'Knight Rider' had done before, just as it had with the motor-vehicle-jumping-over-the-helicopter trick), and a superweapon that can't be believed.

The worst gadget is Bond's car with the cloaking device.  This alone strains credibility (despite using an original way to device the concept), but the car self-healing this ability?  Too much and too typical for the Brosnobond era.

There are a truckload of nostalgia scenes and copycat/ripoff moments to older Bond movies.  Most of them obvious, but at least the 'borrowed' camera angles (ala Jinx emerging from the sea) felt natural, and not forced.

Henchmen?  The only good one here is Mr. Kil.  Stupid name, but for the 3 minutes he was in the show, he actually came across as menacing and threatening.  That was probably why he was killed off so quickly.

One scene I loved was the fencing scene.  It's so nice to see something work right.

But what is up with the quickly changing camera angles that are aimed at the MTV-with-ADHD generation?!  A Bond movie needs to be well paced, not juggled by a bunch of producers high on amphetamines!

And Halle Berry...  highly overrated as an actress, and she blew a few scenes, but she did better in Die Another Day than Talisa Soto had in Licence to Kill (which is an infinitely better Bond movie, and one of Bond's BEST movies).

The sad part is that the movie is enjoyable all the way through, even if it does turn to drivel a third of the way through!  I don't know why, but what should be another disaster of post-lawsuit Bond is actually, as a whole, decent.

Overall?  The first 50 minutes are great, with Bond being captured and tortured, with M actually BEING M for once, and using North Korea in a good way, but goes downhill after that.  It's oddly reminiscent of Roger Moore's ""Moonraker"", only more effective.  Trouble is, mixing Bond and sci-fi is like mixing oil with water, or gasoline to a furnace:  The results don't either work or end up creating something best put to rest quickly.  A super mirror laser that can fry glaciers?  Some rubbish about gene replacement that can change one's whole appearance?  Madonna's wretched credits music, never mind the boring credits visuals?!!

Pity.

May the producers move Bond back to its roots.  If they could make the trailer to ""Goldeneye"" come across serious and thrilling, and manage to get ""Die Another Day"" to give us that impression for 40 minutes, they surely can keep the same gritty and down-to-earth style thought the WHOLE movie?!

1451999,1,B00005JLBE,"I've watched, and loved James Bond movies for many years now. Hell, I've even read the books by Ian Fleming which are better than the movies that are loosely based on. But this is the worst Bond picture ever made! It has too much computor animation  and sci-fi moments. I wouldn't recommened anyone to watch this movie, let alone buy it!",1091577600,7,337,4.524590163934426
1452000,5,B00005JLBE,"I have watched this several times before I wrote anything.  The movie takes repeat viewing well.  Frankly, Bond was, and always will be Sean Connery.  But, time marches on.  We have been through Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and now Brosnan. Each bring their
own touch to the role.
Pierce is losing his pretty boy look as he ages, a plus in my opinion.  He is finally growing into the new age Bond.  Halle Berry is great as Jinx, naturally gorgeous to look at, but she also brings a much need touch of humour.  Toby Stephans is a strong Bond foe, and his fight scene in the fencing school with Brosnan is one of the highlights of the movie.  Very impressively staged scene that has great tension.  A bit more believability than a lot of the typical Bond action sequences.
Sadly, with Q's Desmond Llewelyn passing, you have dry humour in the form of John Cleese assuming the role of the gadget master, who outfits Bond for his cases.  There is a cute homage to the original Connery films with Brosnan tinkering with old props from Thunderball and From Russia With Love.
Face it, Bond, like Star Wars is showing it's age.  Neither seem to impress audiences as they once did.  With that in mind, I did not expect this to be a grade A Bond classic.  Brosnan, while doing justice to the role, fails to make it his own, and each film he has done, just fades in my mind, even after watching several times.
This Bond film is fresh, it will stay with me, so basically, I think it's the strongest of Brosnan's efforts.  He really seems to hit his stride in the film.",1091232000,5,1549,4.408450704225352
1452001,2,B00005JLBE,"I've had an almost life-time interest in the James Bond character.  I was committed to it similar to how Burroughs' fans are committed to Tarzan, and no doubt just as frustrated with the cinematic representation.  In literature, James Bond is presented as a very serious character (if my memory is correct; it's been at least thirty years), a real man with real strengths and vulnerabilities. Only three films really came close to capturing the feel of Fleming's work: DR. NO (to a degree); FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (to an even greater degree); and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (almost dead-on, believe it or not). In the novels, the gadgetry wasn't the main attraction, and what gadgets Fleming included weren't very sophisticated. As a fresh teen, I didn't mind the departure from the novels. That's because I was young and James Bond was cool, because he was adored by beautiful women and he drove that awesome car and he made everything seem like fun.

As the franchise aged, after a certain point the gadgetry seemed to get more complicated, more ridiculously spectacular, until the toys became downright silly, until the films were dragged down into something bordering on campiness. Tradition alone saved the franchise from ever being deemed that way, and the studio perfunctorily churned out a Bond film every couple of years or so, until they became an expensive yawn. My maturity overtook my expectations sometime after Roger Moore took over the role, and not even a nostalgic loyalty to the character could compel me to watch them anymore. They were pure silliness, with those vaulted stainless-steel secret headquarters built into mountainsides from which some villain bearing some bizarre physical handicap -- a gimmicky attempt to give depth to their snide evil -- hatched some absurd plot.  When Timothy Dalton followed Moore as the superspy, my interest was roused.  But as Bond eluded capture by snowboarding in a cello case, my expectations were bombed into oblivion. That was particularly sad, because Dalton was perhaps a deadlier Bond than we'd ever seen. But the tradition of silliness was stronger than Dalton's charisma, and the film slid into triteness for the sake of action, dragging him down with it.

Then came Brosnan. Pierce Brosnan has the elegance and physicality to evoke both the action figure depicted in the best films and the reserve of the character described in the novels. And I figured with a new actor as Bond, along with the audience now proven to be sophisticated enough to enjoy such high-concept espionage films as THE BOURNE IDENTITY and the four Jack Ryan films, the studio would opt to make Bond more like the way Fleming intended him. Instead, they stayed the course, which was to put it on a par with the old BATMAN TV series, with the gadgets even more unbelievably high-tech, again with patented villains (albeit with different handicaps) harboring grandiose master plans, the single difference from the old BATMAN series being that the Bond films have humongous budgets.

As the 20th Bond film -- and the first of the new millennium -- much ado was made of DIE ANOTHER DAY. It promised to be more. But, alas, the promise wasn't kept. The pre-credit action sequence -- a Bond trademark now -- gave temporary credence to the hype, that this was going to be different, ""gritty"" as a couple of reviewers put it.  Bond, surprisingly, was captured.  Though it isn't graphically depicted, and further softened by the slickness of the credits, Bond is tortured. Once the credits are over, the movie is almost immediately reduced to the now tired Bond formula: a few moments of dialogue here and there, followed by out-of-this-world chase scenes made more irritating by the now-familiar blaring orchestrations, designed to distract us from how superfluous it all is, a mediocre concept revved up with gratuitous horns.  It was all there, but our modern sensibilities and the deluge of modern action films rendered it all even more familiar and tedious.  Because digital film techniques make set design and special effects cheaper and action sequences less risky, the filmmakers fling them around with abandon, looking for places to stick them.  So the visuals come at you until you're inured to them.  Overuse of them in a Bond film (such as an Astin Martin -- a nod to the original Bond films -- with an invisibility mode) turns Bond into a mere action figure in a science fiction film, with the action so unrealistic, Bond becomes too remote from danger for any tension.  And that's the main problem: there's never any real tension because you never feel anyone who matters is at any risk.  The essential suspension of disbelief just isn't there.  It's a big show, the spectacle the thing, and it's just dull, dull, dull.  I hated this movie.  I found it at Wal-Mart for $10, and it was so bad, even at that price I felt ripped off.  Never again, say I.  The producers are simply not going to fix this franchise, ever. It's making money just the way it is, and no doubt the studio philosophy is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

What is it I expect from the Bond films? I expect the producers, directors, and writers to create a reasonable facsimile of espionage into which I can escape, something delivering the same thrills I experienced as a youth, but without requiring I bring the same youthful naivete I had back then, which is now lost to me forever. I'm capable of a reasonable suspension of disbelief, but you can't expect me to do ALL the work. When a wristwatch houses a ratchet and a wire strong enough to haul up a full-grown man, it's too much of a stretch, and my incredulity eclipses my willingness to accept the framed reality of the screen. Do for Bond what Tim Burton did for Batman. That might work.",1091059200,9,5768,4.835532994923858

1452004,5,B00005JLBE,"Who would have dreamed in 1963 that Dr. No would be the first of twenty James Bond films?  There have been some misses in those 20 films (Moonraker, Octopussy, to name two), but overall the series has aged quite well, and moves into the 21st century quite adroitly.
While ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE remains my favorite Bond film, Pierce Brosnan has done well in his Bond role.  He's dashing but vulnerable, and he is a good actor.  He's joined in this technological brouhaha by the talented Halle Berry.  While this is certainly not Halle's best performance, she shows the versatility and dedication that eventually led to her Oscar win in MONSTER'S BALL.  She's a beautiful woman and she holds her own in the fight game too!  Rosamund Pike is delightful as Ms. Frost, the double agent who battles Halle in the climax.  Toby Stephens does a good job as Graves, but he's not the most memorable of the Bond villains.  The action sequences and effects are stunning, except for the obvious blue screen used when Bond escapes from the supercar.  And the laser in the sky threat has been used twice before in Bond movies:  You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.  John Cleese is cool as Q; Madonna is silly in her cameo, and DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of the worst themes of any Bond movie.  No one will ever replace John Barry as the master of the Bond themes.  And it wouldn't hurt to see Judi Dench soften a little in her role as M.  Nice touch in having B movie actor Michael Masden as the American NSA chief.

1452066,4,B00005JLBE,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is a Bond movie in which everybody tried hard to come up with something special. The predictable result of all that striving was, of course, that DIE ANOTHER DAY is mostly ordinary Bond du jour.

This, the 20th in the Bond series and the 40th anniversary Bond film, was consciously crafted to be a ""supermovie,"" and it is--in spots. Hard-core Bond fans will appreciate all the nods and winks to the earlier films. Halle Berry's sudden appearance on a beach in Cuba complete with diver's knife, is pure DR. NO. And again, Berry being strapped to a laser table to be cut in half is straight out of GOLDFINGER. A diamond-powered spacecraft is the legacy of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Bond plays idly with his THUNDERBALL jet-pak in Q's laboratory, and so on. Taken all together these scenes form a kind of retrospective melange that is fun to watch. How many can you identify...?

The movie begins on an interesting but unusual note: Bond is captured and tortured by the North Koreans. After more than a year a dirty, long haired, battered Bond is released in a prisoner exchange. Kept in an isolation chamber by MI-6, he is stripped of his 00 number. Managing a quick escape he begins to hunt for whoever betrayed him.

His travels lead him to Jinx (Berry), an American NSA agent who is also hunting the turncoat. Together with fellow agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), they target the bizarre billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens) whose right-hand man turns out to be Zhao (Rick Yune) the man Bond was exchanged for.

The usual gadgets make their appearance. Best of all is an invisible Astin-Martin Vanquish, which, when visible, is easily the most-lethal looking car Bond has ever driven.

Brosnan once again reprises the Conneryesque ""dark Bond"" of DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Brosnan has aged a bit, and his face has developed character. In the seven years since GOLDENEYE he has finally made the role his own in a cool open-neck buttondown manner. The Havana beach scene underscores this by having the ""James Bond Theme"" played in the background with a Latin beat.

There has been talk that Berry deserves her own Jinx franchise, and it certainly would sell. Jinx is a female Bond, wisecracking, irrepressible and endearing.

The difficulties with DIE ANOTHER DAY are all the result of overexuberance on the part of the production team. They tried to create an epic, but the story drags its feet after a very promising beginning. The script quickly becomes predictable and so there's virtually no tension. The bad guys are bland (a mark of recent Bond films). Graves is too fey to seem dangerous and Zhao looks as if he mistakenly stepped off the set of THE MATRIX. Director Lee Tamahori consciously patterned this film after that franchise, and his derivative filmmaking leaves something to be desired.

The producers need to spend more time crafting a storyline and less on the set-action pieces that define Brosnan's Bond. They also need to bring back the Bond who knows which champagne to order at what temperature. In this styleless era such touches would have a life all their own.

The title of the film grinds on the mind, coming so soon after TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Worse yet is the eminently forgettable Madonna title song, a piece of techno-pop throwaway that couldn't even survive in the dance clubs. Madonna's bad cameo as the owner/instructress of a fencing school is hopefully not the augry of a 21st century trend to having the title song artists appear on camera.

There is a hyperreliance on special effects. Bond parasailing off a glacier is nothing more than the most heavyhanded CGI imaginable, exactly like a video game. It looks cheap and unconvincing in the midst of this high-budget project, a film with otherwise beautiful location shooting.

The DVD is a two-disc set that is loaded with production goodies. It's all great fun. Though DIE ANOTHER DAY is ""Bond 20"" it definitely ranks in the top ten.",1087084800,2,3950,4.828402366863905

1452069,3,B00005JLBE,"The thing with Bond is that the premise of the movie never changes and the actors who play Bond either make it or break it.  Thankfully Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job at being the suave, debonair 007.
The story begins in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea with a highspeed hovercraft chase and continues via Hong Kong to Cuba and London where Bond meets up with the two women Jinx (Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) who play such important and differing roles in his quest to unmask a traitor and to prevent a war of catastrophic consequence.  Hot on the trail of the villains, Bond travels to Iceland where he experiences at first hand the power of an amazing new weapon before a dramatic confrontation with his main adversary back in Korea where it all started.  Although this was an ok Bond flick, I wouldn't rush out to buy it and add it to my collection.  No one will ever compare to Sean Connery.",1084060800,,939,4.538461538461538
1452070,4,B00005JLBE,"This is an excellent Bond movie with great stunts, plenty of action and of course the women.
A lot was made of Hale Berry she was interesting and a good character but didn't take over the movie as suggested.
I'm really getting sick of M being played for a fool in these movies.  This never happened before Ms Dench took the Job.
The sword fight in the center was quite awsome and I didn't recognize Madona dressed she should try it more often.
Bond Locked up for over a year was interesting.
However this movie hit a brick wall for me when John Cleese came on the screen.  Cleese plays Q as Basil Faulty and the result is SO good and SO funny that it frankly eclipses the rest of the movie.  I find myself smiling just thinking about it.
There is an excellent comic moment at the end tangently involving Cleese as well.  Both of those scenes are worth the price of the movie.",1082332800,,875,4.284848484848485
1452071,4,B00005JLBE,"I was hyped and excited this being the 40th Anniversary and 20th film in the James Bond series. The first 25 minutes of the movie is ""attention-getting"". Great idea Pierce Brosnan had for a story. The delightful Samantha Bond is back as ""Miss Moneypenny"". They gave her a scene you may never forget. Dame Judi Dench is nice to see again. John Cleese returns this time as the Quartermaster. Desmond Llewelyn passed away in 1999 from a car accident.
 Halle Berry as ""Jinx"" did not impress me.
 Toby Stephens, you might dislike as ""Gustav Graves"" from the beginning. However, I just adore his mother, Maggie Smith and the work she has done.

 This film had some special effects that really was too much and unbelievable to take. Let's not get too carried away with the CGI effects. James Bond on the glacier ice water-skiing with parachutes effect looked so fake. It even looked computer animated. And it was.
 Advancing technology is fine. Creating new, interesting gadgets is fine too. Some of the ""Q"" gadgets in past films have become reality in the present. Keep it real, guys.
 What I thought was really cool and possibly the coolest villain yet was Rick Yune as ""Zao"". Great invention of a villain with a diamond-pelted face.
 Rosamund Pike as ""Miranda Frost"" was refreshing.
  All in all I was disappointed with Die Another Day (2002), but I thought Pierce Brosnan deserved to make one more movie as ""James Bond"". This is his last as 007.

1452072,3,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was a decent Bond flick until they had to nearly ruin it with the Icarus satellite plot device. its basically a rehash of Diamonds are Forever. i take it that the Bond Writers are running out of ideas. they should stick to the roots of For Your Eyes Only and From Russia With Love which concentrates more on plot and characters than special effects and gadgets. but overall i loved the tributes to the old films (although a bit too much)and finally we get to see Bond in a Compromised position since License to Kill especially when he got captured and locked up in a North Korean prison cell for over a year while being routinely tourtured and drugged (possibly even used as a Programmed Assassin, its in the movie!)lastly, we need a good actor to play a Bond Villan (Gary Oldman or Anthony Hopkins in mind?).",1080604800,,825,4.506666666666667
1452073,1,B00005JLBE,"Because he's not in this awful wreck of a film.
Let's see...
Bond gets betrayed and captured in Korea.  He's tortured for over a year (fine, but why did we have to be tortured as well by that awful Madonna song-surely the worst Bond theme ever).  He's traded by British Intelligence for one of their prisoners and this is where the movie falls apart.
First of all, since when does British Intelligence answer to US Intelligence?  Second, how did Bond learn to slow his heart rate?  Third, Bond would never, ever, leave his pajama top undone walking through a hotel lobby. (Although the hotel scene is honestly the best in the film-at least Bond is intelligent in that scene.)
He ends up in Cuba searching for the bad guy, where he meets Halle Berry as ""Jinx"", the worst Bond girl ever.  Their dialogue has to be heard to be (dis)believed.  They end up in a secret clinic where evil doctors swap people's DNA to give them untraceable new identities.
Hey, I know this is scientifically impossible, but I can suspend disbelief for Bond.
Wht I can't suspend my disbelief on is the following:
Bond has aparently become an idiot.  Plots go on around him and he doesn't see any of it.  We see it long before he does.  This should not happen.
Bond has also lost his fighting abilities and, aparently, his marksmanship skills.  He shoots at many people in this film and hits none of them (with the exception of the computer-generated ones.)
A bad guy has built an enormous satellite in space tha nobody knows about, despite the many spy satellites in space.
This same bad guy also has an elaborate underground terrarium for no apparent reason.
The ""skiing over tidal wave"" scene.  I expected Frankie & Annette to show up, the effects were that bad.
When the US government decides to destry the magno-evil-satellite (with British Intelligence ""assisting"", I guess) they shoot one missile at it.  That's right, ONE.  Not several from different angles, as even a five-year-old would be clever enough to do.  The satellite, of course, destroys the mssile, thus stumping the greatest minds of two countries.
Halle Berry then flies a plane through the path of the magno-beam for no apparent reason.
The bad guy's Dad recognizes his son based on something the son says.  Wouldn't you wonder how your Korean son became a white man?  Wouldn't you ask for more info before embracing a total stranger?
Then when Bond is victorious (through luck, it seems-he certainyl has done nothing anyone else would do, like shoot the bad guy when he had the chance) we are treated to a cruel, cruel scene, where Bond and Moneypenny kiss and we discover it's ust Moneypenny playing with the Virual Reality machine.  This might have been cute earlier in the film, but when we cut from Moneypenny sitting alone and disheveled to Bond and Jinx being romantic in a mountain cabin it's just cruel.  It makes us feel like he's cheating on Moneypenny, and makes her seem pitiful.  Badly done, gentlemen...badly done.  Bond & Moneypenny are the cutest ""will they won't they"" couple in films...making her pitiful was just wrong.
All in all, this film was a major disappointment.  Give us BOND...not some guy who is at a loss for the entire film.  He didn't save the day...he was just along for the ride.",1080432000,8,3261,4.714285714285714
1452144,1,B00005JLBE,"This film is beyond bad, and I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it anything lower. I love James Bond, but this film nearly brought me to tears. Has anyone considered going back to the original movies for inspiration? You know, the stories that were actually written by Ian Fleming?
This film was the biggest piece of trash ever. The saddest thing was, is that I didn't feel like I was watching a James Bond movie. All of the Bond movies have a certain feel to them, the good ones anyway. But this one was even worse than the ones Timothy Dalton made.",1079222400,2,563,4.320754716981132
1452145,5,B00005JLBE,"The thing about bond is, you love them or you hate them. In my case, I love them(everyone of them). Pierce Brosnan is great as aways, Halle Berry is beautiful, her acting dosen't even come close to Sophie Marceau(The World Is Not Enough). Forget xXx, forget any other action that came out this year, because Die Another Day takes the cake.",1078272000,3,339,4.573770491803279
1452146,4,B00005JLBE,"To describe James Bond as merely an action hero is to do a disservice to one of the finest screen creations of all time. After 40 years, 20 films, and five leading actors, the character is a cherished piece of popular culture and a national institution. As a result, I was somewhat surprised by the lack of young people in the audience when I attended a Saturday evening presentation of Bond's latest adventure, Die Another Day. The only explanation for this strange deficiency of youth is that many contemporary teenagers write Bond off as a dated artifact of the Cold War. This is a sad occurrence, for Die Another Day is an exciting, sexy and extremely modern thrill ride that is superior to almost every action movie released this year. For anyone who prefers their heroes stylish as well as strong, their female sidekicks cunning as well as curvaceous, and their drinks shaken but not stirred, this film will be a pleasure to view.
Die Another Day offers all of the delightful clichs that we have come to expect from Bond films: beautiful women (in the form of Rosamund Pike and Oscar winner Halle Berry) with questionable loyalties, impressive gadgetry, fast cars, exotic locations and plenty of sex and sexual innuendo. Additionally, the movie contains the usual assortment of stirring action sequences, including a high-speed hovercraft chase, physical confrontations in a burning clinic and a plummeting airplane, and one of the finest fencing matches ever put on film. Most importantly, director Lee Tamahori and screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have provided Bond with realistic enemies that reflect the political conditions of our era. His opponents are not outlandish and outdated supervillians with bizarre European accents, but agents from North Korea (part of president Bush's ""axis of evil"") who threaten world peace with a dangerous device known as the Icarus satellite. This is a timely and provacative plot point, considering the fact North Korea is currently in possession of nuclear weapons that are every bit as dangerous as the satellite in the movie.

In the role of Bond, Pierce Brosnan remains charismatic and effective. His performance incorporates many of the finest attributes of his predecessors, including Sean Connery's poise and ruthlessness, Roger Moore's wit and charm, and Timothy Dalton's dogged determination. He also invests 007 with a rugged inventiveness and vulnerability all his own, reminding us that this franchise is as much about character exploration as it is about intrigue. Brosnan's charm more than compensates for a few  unconvincing and rediculous plot twists and the sloppy nature of some of the special effects.",1077062400,,2676,5.177829099307159
1452147,5,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" can certainly be said to be the best of the last four Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan.  The script is a very good one with clear starting points and carry through; the acting by all involved is a perfect match for the script and the overall feel of the movie harkens one back to the earlier days in the line of 007 James Bond movies where it's all about a big script and big action sequences that leave an audience stunned as James Bond does the impossible time after time and gets a babe or two in the process.
Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan is the perfect actor for James Bond and just as ""Die Another Day"" is the best of his first four Bond films; with this one he gives his best performance yet as Bond, James Bond.  Halle Berry's performance as Jinx, an NSA agent with the same goals as Mr. Bond is perfect.  At the time of this films theatrical release there were rumors about a spin off film with the character of Jinx and Halle Berry in the lead role, since that time ""I've"" heard little about it though.  John Cleese stepping in as Q is a good pick as well, replacing the dearly departed, lovable Desmond Llewelyn in that memorable role.  One of the best scenes in the film is John Cleese's scene as Q and seeing many of the props from earlier movies.  As usual, Judi Dench is perfect as M and ever so gorgeous Rosamund Pike's performance as Miranda Frost is quite memorable.
Lee Tamahori steps in as the director for this great Bond film and does a great job, his previous credits includes directing ""Along Came a Spider"" and episodes of ""The Sopranos.""  Much of the credit for the success of this Bond film can most likely be attributed to his view on Bond and how he aptly displays this film.
The Premise:
As with all Bond films, ""Die Another Day"" starts off with a huge action sequence, setting up the rest of what the film is about.  James Bond infiltrates his way into North Korea, in certainly what can be described as a most unusual way.  He's there to assassinate a North Korean Army Colonel who's selling weapons on the black market.  His cover is blown and yet, through some pretty amazing action sequences, he seemingly accomplishes his mission.  In doing so though, he's captured by the North Korean Army and in particular, the father of the Colonel he's seemingly assassinated.  After spending several months in a North Korean prison being tortured, he's traded back to the British for a North Korean agent.
What follows from there is most certainly the most exciting Pierce Brosnan Bond movie yet!  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of Bond movies or people who are fans good action/drama films!  No collection of James Bond DVD films is complete without this one!  {ssintrepid}

1452148,1,B00005JLBE,"This is without a doubt the worst Bond film ever made.  Even without mentioning the cheasy Madonna-Product tie in, the story is just weak, and the inconsistancies in Bond's character are unforgivable.

1452150,4,B00005JLBE,"The movie opens superbly - although the surfing sequence was a bit too long to be believable even for a Bond movie.  The tale is typical Bond; bad guy, questionable girls, great gadgets.  But this habit of having Bond 'go off on his own' and be a renegade is getting a little overplayed.  Granted, there is a plot twist where 'M' actually supports this ""personal vendetta.""  But having seen similar vendetta's in Goldeneye, License to Kill, and others - enough already.  And, how soon the producers forget, the outrage of Bond fans over the whole premise of License to Kill.  What happened to days of old, where Bond followed orders, or at least only bent them slightly, and the story line was more about the bad vs good rather than bad vs really mad good guy?  Other than my own personal distate for the plot twist, its a good solid addition to the Bond collection.  Halle Berry is stunning and plays her part well.  Great car chase action.  Stunning scenery.",1074297600,,960,4.594117647058823
1452151,3,B00005JLBE,"The title of Bond's twentieth foray onto the screen comes not from Ian Fleming but rather from the last line of a Houseman poem. Lee Tamahori directs the hero through the usual paces but by now the franchise seems a little dated. Sure there is a lot of action here but the film is a little weak (read farfetched) when it comes to plot.
In this film Bond must save the world from a mad North Korean colonial who has perfected what is essentially a death ray. The colonial wants to use his death beam in order to move into South Korea and then into the west.
All the usual Bond special features are here. We have car chase on ice, exotic locales, beautiful women but something feels like its missing. Halle Berry tries hard in this movie as NSA agent Jinx but she remains little more than eye candy. If there is a Bond girl to watch in this outing it is Rosamund Pike who plays double agent Miranda Pike.
The real treat here is the two DVD set by Universal which offers two commentaries, a trivia track, a great documentary, photo galleries and Madonna's video of the title song.

Review
`A Bond movie falls into a specific genre and you have to provide certain elements. You must respect the fact it's essentially about girls, guns, gadgets and big action.' says director Lee Tamahori. It's a shame he missed out a plot and decent acting. Now before I am slated, I just want to go on record as saying I love Bond movies and no one was more surprised or disappointed with this awful product than myself.
The film opens brilliantly with a stunning chase sequence that results in Bond's capture. Unfortunately the breathtaking start is not sustained. The major strength at the start is that Bond has a nemesis in the guise of Colonel Moon, played by Will Yun Lee, an actor who manages to create an adversary that captivates the audience. The irony is that Lee appears for 15 minutes then fakes his death and has genetic surgery to become Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).
Stephens is awful. He creates that sense of annoyance within me that I can only compare to the character of Ian Beale from Eastenders. He's not an evil villain, but just a bloke you want to punch for wasting your time. Bond films thrive on the foe, and if the foe is not up to standard then Bond can't excel. You even begin to notice that witty quips and gadgets do not make a movie and cannot hold a narrative together no matter how many explosions you throw at it.
What's sad about this `new Bond for a new Millennium' is that after the hype surrounding XXX, it sinks to that film's low standards rather than rising above such a poor competitor. Yes, featured here are some fast motion macro zooms - the staple of the modern action film - an amazing invisible car, and a virtual reality sequence with its own take on Matrix Bullet Time. But you have to ask why has this been done to the country's favourite secret agent? They've tried hard to appeal to a mass market whilst missing out exactly why people have been fascinated by Bond for 40 years!
So what of Brosnan and Berry? Is the chemistry to die for or can it wait till another day? Well like that joke, the Berry/Brosnan match up sucks. Berry seems uncomfortable with her character throughout the entire film. I know the Bond girl stereotype doesn't give much scope for an actress but her sassy wisecracking seems worn out and her interaction with Bond stale. Brosnan on the other hand does amazingly well with what he has to work with. He IS Bond and the character fits him so well. The prison scenes give a glimpse of him being allowed to use his character in a new direction and it would have been a joy to see him explore this. And his scenes with John Clease's Q and Judi Dench's M are always a pleasure.
The Verdict
The twentieth official Bond film in the series, and it surmounts to nothing more than an overblown action film, with script and plot to match. A crying shame and a great disappointment, hopefully this won't signal a new direction but rather an experiment. I pray that Brosnan comes back one last time and shows us how it should be done. He is a great Bond and this should not be his last.",1073433600,18,3538,4.512461059190031

1452206,1,B00005JLBE,I was really excited about this movie coming out and followed all the new on the production on comingsoon.net. The beginning of the movie was different. The bullet flying at you was kind of a surpiring twist and the hovercraft scene was pretty good i geuss. The whole idea of Bond being tortured and caught for a change was pretty good to. Then the music started and it went downhill from there. The modanna song sucked. Then he was on a boat thats background look completly fake. Then Hallie comes...an award winning actress...and she sucked. (when he is having sex with her in cuba it looks like he's having sex with a 14 year old boy). Then the invisible car..yeah right..and the the surfing on the door in the artic..looked extremly fake. What happened to the good old bond movies like the Spy who loved me where bond skies off a cliff and parachutes to safty (which was really done by a stunt man). Hopfully the bond makers will wake up and realize they r ruining it by trying to make it all high tech and copy movie effects from movies like matrix (every movie does the slow down speed up thing these days ). ALso there are rumors of Ewan McGreger replacing Brosnen after he steps down. Ewan is hard to picture as bond... i would recommend Jude Law...Jason Statham is pretty cool too...he'd make a good villian.  Also the return of a reacurring villian like the good ole days of S.P.E.C.T.E.R. would be nice.,1072915200,8,1414,4.5234375
1452207,3,B00005JLBE,"This film was a disgrace. Probably the worst Bond film ever. I love Pierce Brosnan, though. I thought that it wasn't as realistic as some of the other Bond films, and the characters were poorly developed, leaving me with some questions about what was going on. They covered some of this up with the amazing car chase scene and the breathtaking ice palace, but overall, this film was a flop. Sorry James, I'll pass.",1072742400,,414,4.608108108108108
1452208,5,B00005JLBE,"I like how the same person writes the same bad review but gives it a one star one time and a 2 next.  *Laughs*
This was probably the second best Bond film of the whole series. Sure there were some cheesy parts but EVERY Bond film had them. The Action was great, the story was actually there and well done. The problem is you had to THINK this time and clearly not many like to do that.  This put Pierce on the map as one of the best Bonds right behind Sean Connery.  Great GREAT movie.",1072483200,2,485,4.03125
1452209,2,B00005JLBE,"This movie was a fantastic failure. I've been a decent fan of the Bond Franchise for 20 years. I've never seen a really bad Bond film...until now. And this is hard for me to say because Brosnan is my favorite Bond. Despite looking incredibly old in this film, his acting was pretty poor. As other have said, the one-liners in this movie were horrendous. The only thing more stupefying were the ridiculous special effects. Maybe they should have saved the money they spent on Halle Berry (what was her purpose in the film?) and put it toward the effects.

I thought the scene in Goldeneye where Bond jumps into a moving plane was pretty far fetched, but I bought it because it's a Bond film. However the part in this film where Bond escape falling off a cliff by parachuting down an avalanche and then WINDSURFING to freedom was insane! Yes, he actually takes a car, rips off the roof, and uses it as a surfboard to windsurf over a huge tidal ave.

And Madonna. I thought her theme song was catchy, but not appropriate for a Bond movie. Her role in this film was pointless and the limited amount of lines she had produced a Razzie-acceptable performance.

This has been the first time I've ever stopped watching a Bond movie from boredom. Had I been in the theater I probably would have walked out.",1072396800,,1297,4.51063829787234

Nope, it was worse. I'm a big Bond fan, of Sean Connery and Roger Moore, but this was a complete joke. It made A View To A Kill look like a classic.
AN INVISIBLE CAR???? SWAP YOUR DNA FOR AN HOUR'S SLEEP???? A GLOBAL WARMING CAUSING (Diamonds Are Forever-another bad Bond film-ripoff) SATELLITE???? Bond can't tell his gun has been unloaded? Give me a break. Also the 'CGI' (I use the term loosely) look as if they've been made with a PS2. Also the jumpy editing did my head in.
Brosnan looked bored, and the writers didn't seem interested either. I think that mostly the blame should go on the director, because at the end of the day he has to make it and could have changed it if he wanted to. The only jump cut I want to see is his face when he gets fired. Save your money and watch Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me instead.",1071446400,9,961,4.063157894736842

1452273,2,B00005JLBE,"I had hi hopes that ""Die Another Day"" would be a great Bond film (at least better then ""The World is Not Enough""), but I guess not every film in this franchise can be a winner.
""Die Another Day"" is so over the top with gadgets (a car that can cloak?), pointless characters, less then believable effects, and horrible sexual innuendo jokes (its what you expect from a Bond film, but this one really over did it), that you wonder if the franchise has any hope at all of continuing (quality wise).
The character of Jinx (played by Halle Berry) is useless in this movie.  The press and studio hyped her as being the female equivalent of James Bond.  In reality, Jinx stands around most of the time looking hot.  She fires a hand gun about five times, jumps off a computer generated cliff, spends the next hour a damsel in distress, and then has a less then average sword fight at the end.  I don't think Halle Berry is a bad actress, but she has to work with some terrible dialog.  She comes off sounding like a cheerleader who recently got recruited into the NSA and then spouts embarrassing jokes about Bond's private parts.  If you want to see a real Jane Bond, check out Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  She does more in five minutes what Jinx does in the two hour span of ""Die Another Day"".
The other problems would be the fact that the technology is excessively hi tech.  The Aston Martin that can turn invisible, the ridicules body armor that Toby Stephens dons at the end of the movie, the giant laser, and a mess of other props just come off as excessive.  The Bond movies are know for the sexual banter, but ""Die Another Day"" has every other sentence be about sex (who has ever said ""I got the thrust of it""?)  Because of this, the dialog is flat out corny and lame.
Some of the better parts of the movie are the action sequences.  The stand out is the trick-car VS trick-car scene.  It's fantastic to see two luxury automobiles armed with rockets and machine guns go at one another.  The action scenes are great if you avoid everything else in between (which is a lot).
If you want to see a great Bond film, go out and get ether ""Goldfinger"", ""For Your Eyes Only"", ""License to Kill"", and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  See Bond at his best, instead of one of his worst outings.",1070323200,5,2296,4.371764705882353

There are some high points -- the use of North Korea, Bond in captivity, adventures in Cuba -- but the moment the film shifts to the wintery setting for its last half, it's as though we're watching Roger Moore circa ""Moonraker."" The film becomes cliche, camping and outright silly, and even the ice palace -- clearly meant to be impressive -- just looks like a leftover from a cheap 1970s science fiction movie.
While I hope Bond is never fully retired, it feels like it's time to put the franchise on the shelf again for a decade or so, and let a new generation of creators find a way to make him the hero he's meant to be, and so often has been in the past.

I always read reviews now about people bashing this film, and I admit, some parts are pretty bad, but just look past them and look at the film as a whole,and you'll realize it's not that bad.  Brosnan is the most like Fleming's Bond in this one I think, even though he acts a lot like Fleming's Bond in all of his films.  The film has a spectacular beginning with Bond getting captured and tortured in North Korea (this is the first time anything like this has happened in a Bond film!).  All the scenes in the movie are great until he gets to Iceland where the film begins to go slightly downhill, but is still a joy to watch.  Now the ending is just horrible when Bond and Jinx go after Graves in North Korean air space!

Every Bond film has a plot that could never happen but the plot of ""Die Another Day"" just could never happen even if you suspend your disbelief with all of your will. There are two things that would just never happen no matter what.
1. There is no way a scientist would ever be able to ""trade"" DNA.
2. There is no way any government would let villains build a weapon in space.
Why (by the way) were the good guys in shock that the weapon was there? Why didn't they know about the weapon until the end of the film? The governments of the world have satellites everywhere. They would have seen astronauts (or machines) building the weapon.
""Die Another Day"" was more of a live action video game then a movie. It was really a waste of time. Most of the Bond movies are far-fetched but they at least have technology and plots that you can believe if you really stretch your disbelief. Die Another Day was just too ridiculous to ever fathom or believe. I hope the next film is better.",1066262400,3,1006,4.328042328042328
1452281,1,B00005JLBE,"I had such high hopes for the 20th Bond film....When I read the original premise on the net, Bond is captured, tortured, I thought, ""Wow, they are really going to do something special.""  I saw this movie as an opportunity to explore the real Bond, the Bond Fleming wrote about years ago.  He wasn't super human in the novels, he was a man, a flawed man, who almost lived to die.
Captured and tortured, how would this affect him emotionally?  Would he lose his confidence?  Being locked up with no physical contact, what would his first encounter with a woman after the torture be like?  Would he be second guessing himself?  What I really wanted to see in Bond this time around was fear...and how he would deal with that fear to return to the man he once was.
But alas, you get this piece of trash.  The angle which I had dwelled on for so many months was dispelled in the first 10 minutes.  After Bond is free, he's back to the one liners, sleeping with as many woman as he can find, and still drinking those martinis.  He didn't even have flashbacks or nightmares about his incarseration.  The rest of the film is a bunch of bunk, essentially, it's the ""Best of Bond"" composed of think plot lines from ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Goldeneye""
and a bit of every other Bond flick.
A BIG dissapointement.  Also, why did they put so much stock in Halle Berry's character of Jinx.  The movie is a James Bond picture, not Bond and sidekick.  The producers put too much emphasis on that aspect.
I believe the best Bond films from the Brosnan era are:
Tomorrow Never Dies
The World is Not Enough
Simply because these films seem more real.  More in touch with today.  TND dealt with media manipulation.  TWINE dealt with personal vendettas set against the backdrop of an Oil crisis.  Die Another Day is a big rush, just all over the place, no real cohesiveness.  Die Another Day is so far in fantasy land, with Death Rays and Ice Castles, you would think good ol' Walt Disney had something to do with this production.
Let's just hope the producers of the next film have gotten this ""millenium"" Bond out of their system and go back to the roots of Bond.  Sure the gadgets are cool, but lets focus on character.  To me, that's more interesting than an Aston Martin with pop up machine guns.

My favorite part of the movie was Bonds' car. His Aston Martin Vanquish is spectacular. The car fight between it and the Jaguar was so cool and really the first of it's kind.

1452335,4,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day, the 20th Bond installment is for the most part entertaining.  The best Bond film yet, well I'm not sure. Featuring a great cast including Halle Berry, Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Judi Dench and John Cleese as well as Diretor Lee Tamahori (Along Came A Spider, The Edge).
  Pierce Brosnan reprises his role as the secret agent James Bond 007, which he still aces.  Bond is trouble when he learns he's been betrayed, soon he embarks on a craz North Korean (Rick Yune) who has an accomplice, our villan Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).  Graves has a sophisticated weapon, a laser satellite and wants complete dominance over the world.  The movie's plot isn't totally original or intelligent but it still works.  Bond is on the trail with an assitant, our new, gorgeous Bond girl Halle Berry playing an NSA agent named Jinx.  The film features a few remarkable sets and locations including a set consisting of ice.  The gadgets aren't too amazing, mainly the car, the Aston Martin Vanquish with a unique invisibility mechanism.  Gadget guru John Cleese and Judi Dench as ""M"" sparkle.
  Die Another Day is rated PG-13 for Action Violence and Sexuality.  The film is abundant in terms of violence, including gunplay, swordplay, a hovercraft and car chase and fistfights.  There is also a decent amount of sexual innuendo, and non-explicit sexual situations but rather steamy and erotic.  Worth seeing, I saw it in theatres and was glad I did and now own it on DVD.

Pierce Brosnan once again reprises his role as the suave secret agent as we find him imprisoned and tortured in a Korean prison camp for 14 months (which begins with a slam bang action sequence).  Later on, Bond is out for revenge against his betrayers, and soon runs into the mysterious Jynx (Halle Berry) who herself is a spy with an agenda.  Brosnan is at his usual best as 007, while Berry provides ample eye candy, but her acting talents aren't necessarily put to use.  The rest of the cast includes the returning Judi Dench and John Cleese as M and Q respectively, and also Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, Michael Madsen, and Colin Salmon.  Director Lee Tamahori manages to keep the film packed with enough momentum even without action on the screen, and even as the action scenes and situations borderline on the ridiculous, you can't help but keep yourself glued to the screen.  Die Another Day is far from being the best Bond film, but compared to the previously disappointing The World is Not Enough, this is far superior.

1452337,1,B00005JLBE,"How does the twentieth Bond flick hold up? If you're wondering, this is more closer to 3.8 stars than four.
 Once again, the monotone, robotic Pierce Bronsan is cast as James Bond. Though his performance in ""Goldeneye"" was his best, Bronsan tries hard with this one and it shows, and that's not a good thing.
 When watching ""Die Another Day"", you may get the feeling you have watched it before. No......not all Bond flicks were the same. It's because ""Die Another Day"" has completly NO orignial plot! Believe it or not, much of the plot is from previous Bond flicks. After the amazing pre-credits sequence and an akward theme song, Bond quits the MI6 and becomes a rouge. This was borrowed from the far superior ""Licence to Kill"", Obviously, ""Licence to Kill"" writers were a heck of a lot smarter than those of ""Die Another Day"". Then there was the diamond smuggling, which also came from a so-called ""flawed"" Bond flick, ""Diamonds are Forever"". The icy car chase came from yet another far superior Bond flick ""The Living Daylights"", although ""The Living Daylights"" did it much better. Finally the final plane fight was so totally a ""Goldfinger"" rip-off. Again, they turned to ""The Living Daylights"" for part of the plane fight.
 I don't see the fuss about Halle Berry being a Bond girl. She's kinda like all the others. She's hot & super sexy, she can fight, she screams, she gets captured. In a way, she's a contrived Pussy Galore/ Holly Goodhead.
 The villians were so preditible and were not threating at all. They were downright laughible. They were too un-realistic to keep you awake at night the way Carl Stromberg, Franz Sanchez,  Dr. No, Auric Goldfinger, and Oddjob did well.
 If you can get past all the flaws, there is a smeary gem in this film. It certainly is watch-able. The Bond movies really started to go downhill after ""Goldneye"", and I don't think Bronsan can save it anymore. Perhaps they should re-hire Timothy Dalton.",1063152000,3,1940,4.758928571428571

Pierce Brosnan plays the role of James bond with great panache.
I thought Haile Berry was incredibly sexy and thrilling in her role as American agent, Jinx you would think butter wouldn't melt in her mouth), as was the gorgeous fencer Rosamund Pike as the treacherous Miranda Frost.
John Cleese and Judy Dench are great as M and Q respectively.
Then of course there are all the gadgets and the exotic locales like the Ice Palace in Iceland.

Secondly, the gritty scenes that follow during the title credits are compelling and perfectly matched by Madonna's techno-like theme song.  Third, there's a great, cartoon-like villian:  the accident that causes diamonds to be permanently etched in his face is on par with the accident that gives Batman's Joker his grotesque appearance.  Plus, as with all Bond films, there are gripping action sequences, cool cars and other vehicles (nothing's cooler than a hovercraft!), and a few great one-liners.
That being said however, I couldn't find much else to like about this film.  Given all of the hoopla which surrounded Halle Berry and the fact that her character will be in a spinoff, I was expecting a great performance, but her acting was only average, and the Jinx character was really no different than any other Bond girl.  I also found that the movie's main villian, Gustav Graves, was not all that villianous at all; I kept picturing him saying ""old sport"" (the actor also played Jay Gatsby in a TV movie).

Does this man have any flaws? Any weaknesses that any of us can relate to? No. But thats okay, because the J.B. character was never designed that way, he is what every man wants to be. That is the way it has been since the franchise began, and this movie served that purpose well. The action scenes are flat out spectacular and the villians are just as creative and devious as ever. My biggest problem was that all of the gadgets and technology seemed a little too unrealistic, even for a Bond movie, not to mention a slight disregard for the laws of physics. If Bond were made a bit more vulnerable and the outrageous technology were toned down a bit, I would have given it a higher score, other than that, it is an entertaining flick, and a worthy addition to the James Bond genre.",1061769600,,1145,4.28110599078341

If we hadn't have been caught, then there would have been no story, because of the person who betrayed him. I mean, he is trying to figure out who dunnit while trying to catch the North Korean traded in order to get Bond back. The gadgets are cool. The car isn't invisible just to let you know. It has those cameras to make it ""blend in"" with its surroundings. Hence, not invisable, camoflagued. The villians, were sadly though out though. It was obvious who the villian was to me, and you could predict what he was going to do. In my opinion, this Bond was a more realistic than most people said. This Bond shows that even the ""worlds greatest spy"" can even make mistakes. The DNA therepy has fake, although, you can have surgeries to change your appeance, just not as much as the movie does. I didn't mind Hally Berry as the Bond Girl, but, they could have made her character better than they did. I don't really like Madonna, but didn't hate the theme song.

Let me tell you one thing. By today's standards - and they are low, very low indeed - it may figure as a discreet action, science fiction, fantasy, adventure movie. But buy ""true"" standards, it isn't worth a nickel.
Too many rehashed cliches make this one, one of the many JB movies. Pierce Brosnan's efforts at dramatic acting are simply academic and by that I don't mean graduation courses, but rather the first year of drama school at best.
Judi Dench is another matter and thank God for her, she is just in it for very brief moments.
In the scenes in which she is paired with Brosnan, I could detect in her, a somewhat strong retainment from laughter. Admirable!
The whole movie is more a bad excuse at involving North Korea, with its Nuclear threat, but even this is swiftly dealth with and instead we are treated with an ""invisible"" Aston Martin, a diamond studded satellite (ever seen it elsewhere? Hint: a mixture of Diamonds are Forever and Goldeneye. How imaginative can this become?), a lame attempt at bio-genetic restructuration (again, Ernst Stavro Blofeld in Diamonds are Forever, attempted the same thing), a very British sounding villain (who at the beginning of the movie sounded more American than anything) and ""lethal girls"" a gogo. Groovy Baby!
And this should be a masterpiece? It lacks true imagination, true acting, true subplots and some old-fashioned flair, depicted here, just within a conventional sword-fight (perhaps the director had envisaged to film the Three Musketeers, all over again).
To top it all off, we have a finale a la Flash Gordon. Welcome to virtual reality you all MTV boys...
No, no, no,... no more foreplay, as Pierce Brosnan once stated.
Unfortunately we notice the absence of ""Cubby"" Broccoli, of Harry Saltzman and far more, the influence of its creator, Mr. Ian Fleming himself.
This has become a cartoon character, a farce of itself. Who needs Austin Powers, Johnny English and Casino Royale, with its multiple Bonds anymore? It makes fun of itself.
Unluckily for us, this is not what we came to expect from 007, in its comfortable and luxurious world.
Where is the elegance, the style, the flamboyant touch? Where are the ""bigger than life"" villains, who were still true men, like Goldfinger, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Odd-Job or even Jaws?
Villains have become ""rampant nerds"" and this alone, as shown in the real world, is deviant from [dangerous].
Women have changed too. They have become men. Bravo!
I personally would not at all feel attracted by a female ""man"", but rather by a true and full-blooded woman with a brain, a [weak] brain if need be, but simply a brain.
Yet, seemingly no one seems to notice that today's 007 movies tend to glorify more brawns than brains. No wonder the CIA, the KGB (or whatever its name is nowadays), the FBI and other similar associations are ineffective in fighting terrorism.
If it is true what is depicted in JB movies, then ""Intelligence"" may not be part of the CIA acronym anymore.
A punch in the nose seldom solves the problems of the world, but in this testosterone-ruled world, it seems to have become normal just to punch, shove and kick people around, instead of talking to them.
No. Bring back Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Thunderball and even The Man with the Golden Gun together with The Spy who Loved me anytime, but spare us these Bond platitudes, which only harm the franchise.
And to those who have never, ever bothered watching previous Bond movies, I say, go and rent, buy or [borrow] a copy of the old movies (especially Diamonds are Forever, starring Sean Connery) and you will see what I mean.
To the newcomers to the series I say, start at the beginning and work yourselves up. Pierce Brosnan is not Sean Connery and Sean Connery was not Roger Moore. Timothy Dalton certainly wasn't either and George Lazenby had only one gig, but what a gig!
Today's Bond has become Terminator and while I like the Terminator movies, this is not the place nor the kind of time, in which to have a ""lame duck"" as a Robocop of the world...",1059782400,8,4175,4.712722298221614
1452398,4,B00005JLBE,The Die Another Day DVD is a 2 disc set with one disc devoted to special features. It has lots of interesting features to go along with a good movie. I'd recommend this too anybody who likes a good action movie.,1059782400,,211,4.170731707317073
1452436,5,B00005JLBE,"This movie has it all. The girls, the bad guys, the cars, the gadgets, and a much more hardcore Bond. The special effects are way over the top and the plot of the movies makes more sense than other Bond films you've seen. Since "" Goldfinger"" was the best Bond film I ever saw, I think "" Die Another Day"" was too. James Bond ( Pierce Brosnan) kicks major arse in this movie and once again like in the other movies, he is still wise and he still gets the girls!!! The new Bond Girl, Jynx ( played by none other than the hot and talented Halle Berry)also kicks butt. She can fight and she was born on Friday the 13th. So she proves that she is the best Bond Girl out of all the rest of the Bond Girls in the previous films. The villains in this one r very cool. Zao ( played by Rick Yune) shows no mercy and Gustav Graves(played by Toby Stephens) is reall cool as the main villain.
SPOILERS: I never thought Miranda Frost ( Rosamund Pike) would be the one to set up James Bond in North Korea all along. It was very shocking when she turned the gun to James Bond. Very cool! Director Lee Tamahori gives us some good stuff to watch. He made this Bond movie his own and I gotta give hm props for that. My favorite scene in this movie was the laser part, where Jynx was tied up and Bond came to save her and I also liked the airplane scene. That was too much action for me. And the DVD is too much also. There is a lot of cool extras like: audio commentary from Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike, Inside "" Die Another Day"" documentary, and the image database. I also like the song theme for the movie. Madonna sounds good in it and I liked her small role in the film. So I give this DVD 5 stars cause it has everything u want from a James Bond film!!!!",1059696000,,1744,4.057971014492754

The bad guys were really bad but not very believable. The special effects were special but not that special. An ice hotel? Dueling super cars? Trans-morphic DNA cloning?  Bond getting caught? Give me a break. Never happen. The producers and director seem to be losing the magic formula and trying to make up for it with flash and glitz.

I found the chemistry between Halle Berry and Pierce Brosnan flat. He had more chemistry with the bad girl-Miranda and even that was stretching it!
Rick Yune was a great looking bad guy. Diamonds imbedded in the face-interesting. But the other villians- predictable.
I agree with Elton John, the theme song was the worst of the franchise. No, sorry, you could also add Carly Simon's ""Nobody does it better"" as well. On Her Majesty's Secret Service is still the best Bond theme song! Madonna should have been left out of this movie all together!
The best part of this movie is the car. The Aston Martin Vanquish!!! Awesome Car! That was the star of this movie!
I guess I just expected something huge for the 40th Anniversary. Plus, I'm more bias to my two favorite Bonds-George Lazenby and Sean Connery. I love that old sixties spy genre.

The entire movie was excellent until the ending. Do something new. Don't do something we've seen before. Even with a horrid ending, DIE ANOTHER DAY is still one of the best Bond movies in recent memory. It has everything! Two villians that are some of the best in the Bond saga, two hot women (Jinx and Miranda Pike in her sports bra thingie) swordfighting, an extremely cool invisible car, one of the coolest title sequences in all of the Bond films, a very cool car chase in Iceland, one of the best songs in the Bond series and of course MR. BLONDE (Michael Madsen from RESERVOIR DOGS) is in it!
The fact that the ending ripped off another Bond movie made it my 2nd fave in the series (1st is the very underrated and unappreciated FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.) DIE ANOTHER DAY is Pierce Brosnan's best Bond. DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the key elements that made the series so popular in the 60's and 70's.

Pierce B was better than Tim Dalton but the scripts and direction were incredibly weak in previous films.  Not to mention boring bad guys.
Die Another Day is a return to form.  If it's going to be Brosnan's last turn as Bond, I'll miss him.  Great script, big sets, riveting action and good direction from Lee Tamahori.  This is the most interesting Bond film since Goldeneye.

1452513,4,B00005JLBE,"This was typical of many summer blockbusters, but it fell below par for most James Bond films. Like other summer films, there were too many scenes of unnecessary explosions (too obviously contrived), pedantic sensuality and loudness. I enjoy those things when they are done well -- they just were not done very well here. However, the movie gets back on track to the plot just in time to keep you watching it.

I have to say I expected this to be another typical Bond outing where you know it's going to be trying but you watch it anyway. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike most Bond movies where the opening sequence ends up being something completely unrelated and Bond manages to escape by leaping off mountains on a pair of skis into an awaiting plane - here he doesn't. He actually gets caught. And so beings an adventure that is for once intriguing and holds your attention. Brosnan is really in his element here and doesn't seem like it's Remington Steele pretending to be Bond. In addition, Halle Berry is a welcome addition and quite believable. This isn't Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist who also happens to enjoy running around in shorts and a see through tank top.
For the car fanatic - I think this is the best we've seen since The Spy Who Loved Me. The beautiful Aston Martin Vantage is featured throughout and isn't destroyed for once(probably because there are only 300 in the world).
Wonderful photography, good directing, great villans, exotic cars and Halle Berry in a bikini. Who could ask for more? A worthy anniversary Bond movie and a decent DVD.",1058313600,3,1253,4.778801843317972
1452515,4,B00005JLBE,"This is by far the most interesting and best-produced of the recent James Bond movies, with an interesting plot, breath-taking photography, and a smart, sassy, and able cast making it work. Pierce Brosnan has finally made the part his own, escaping the long shadow of our much-love Mr. Connery by creating a new visage and a new, hipper style for the intrepid Mr. Bond. Here he is joined by the eye-popping Halle Berry, whose emergence from the surf is a welcome sight for these old male eyes. They connect well on the film, with the twist that she is the first Bond conquest ready to love him and leave him, too.
The story here is credible and appealing; sent in to assassinate a North Korean general, Bond is captured after successfully and rather spectacularly killing the target. By the time he is exchanged for an opposite number months later, his reputation has been sullied, his loyalty questioned, and his -00 sanction to kill revoked. Bond decides to take things into his own hands, and stepping away from his guarded hospital ward where he is being held under security, begins to unravel the mystery to regain his reputation and his job. Brosnan and Berry are ably aided by a top-notch supporting cast, including Dame Judi Dench, John Cleese, Rick Yune, and a number of notable others.
I was, for example, amused to discover the material girl, Madonna herself, popping up in a brief cameo appearance mid-film, and she played her part well enough, but hardly lit up the screen. As usual for a Bond-flick, the action and the pyrotechnics are superb, especially an intriguing use of multiple lasers in a fight scene that has an unusual rhythm to it that is quite well shot, and also a number of interesting and diverting chase scenes that I found quite entertaining. The script is well written, and the usual Bond banter and repartee is as good as ever.  All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment, and the only disappointment I had with it is that the credit only alluded to the fact that James Bond would be back, but without mentioning the name of the next film. For we die-hard Bond devotees, that was a disappointment. Otherwise, enjoy!",1058313600,9,2157,4.721485411140583
1452516,4,B00005JLBE,"Bond fans will certainly find everything that they've become accustomed to in this multi-billion dollar franchise.  Non-stop action, unbelieveable gadgets, steamy (but discreet) sex scenes and witty James Bond repartee are all present.
The viewer will barely be in his or her seat before the action begins.  As Bond (Pierce Brosnan) attempts to stop the son of a North Korean General from starting World War III, he is captured and imprisoned for fourteen months.  Stipped of his double-0 status he is freed only after a prisoner exchange is deemed necessary with the North Koreans.  Bond spends the rest of the movie chasing the renegade son across the world in an attempt to thwart his nefarious plan.
I can't begin to cover much of this plot because it has a number of twists and turns throughout.  Rather than give away too much of the plot, let me suffice to say that the viewer will once again find out that what appears to be the obvious is not the case as it has been with most of the other 19 installments to this series.
Halle Berry is excellent as the American NSA agent who's after the North Koreans as well.  The view of her coming out of the ocean after a swim is the greatest scene of it's kind since Bo Derek's in ""10"".  Toby Stephens (the North Korean ""baddie"") and M16 agent Rosamund Pike are also very good.  And, of course, ""M"", ""Q"" and Moneypenny are all present act reprise their roles.  As equally important to the plot line in these movies are the gadgets that are introduced.  However, it seemed as if the writers of this film really had to struggle to come up with believeable hardware.  Come on now - an invisible car?!
Actually this is the only area in which I would pan this film.  It's almost as if Bond has become too much of a super hero (partly due of course to the gadgets) instead of a super spy.  His indestructability causes the viewer to lose the human connection that we all have had with the franchise over the years.  The Connery and Moore Bonds were tough too, but you couldn't help feel that their was some vulnerability with their characters that's not present with the Brosnan or Dalton Bonds.  But in this era of movies starring super heroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk, evidently the producers of this film felt like they had to ""keep up with the Jones"" to excite their audience.  In this humble reviewer's opinion, I don't think this franchise has to rely on that to satisfy it's fans!
Hey, let me get down off this soapbox to tell you that if you've liked the other Bond films than you'll love ""Die Another Day"".  It's got everything that you'll need for a couple of hours of great escapism.  Also included with the film is a second disc of action sequences, gadget featurettes, scene evolutions, and ""the making of..."" documentary.  A handy addition to the package!

1452517,5,B00005JLBE,Great Bond flick. Halle Berry is sexy and exciting to watch and Pierce has still got it.

1452518,2,B00005JLBE,"The return of James Bond is always an anticipated event. When 'Die Another Day' came out, expectations grew, knowing it was the 20th Bond movie to be released in the ever-going series. Pierce Brosnan reprises the role of 007 once again, but his age is very noticeable here. Bond seems to have immatured, somewhat returning to the campy, comic-book style ego of the Roger Moore days. What's even more disappointing is that 007 has gone way too hi-tech, it's become evident this is no longer the original Ian Fleming creation we have all come to know.
The story itself is just a reworking of the plots found in 'Diamonds Are Forever' and 'GoldenEye'. The dialogue is boiled down to constant childish one-liners and James isn't the same cool, charming and intelligent spy he used to be, being heavily dependent on gadgets and guns instead of brains. Halle Berry as Jinx feels like she belongs in another movie and her presence serves no purpose to the story. You get smacked in the face with loads of special effects, and the movie is so technologically annoying. Genetically altered villians? Weapon-enhanced cars that don't dent? Also, the part where James hang-glides off the cliff and water-skis is the most laughable scene in 007 history.
'Die Another Day' also contains the worst theme song of any Bond movie, and David Arnold's score isn't quite up to par. The only thing great about this movie is the nostalgic elements they integrated from previous Bond films. If you're a big fan of action, women, cars, guns and explosions, you may enjoy 'Die Another Day'. However, seasoned 007 fans may want to wait for Bond's next outing. As the 20th installment in a long-running series, this was a disappointment.",1057881600,2,1709,4.8561643835616435
1452519,4,B00005JLBE,"While ""Die Another Day"" may not be the absolute best of all the Bond films, the DVD is, by a long shot, the best Bond package ever released for home viewing.  MGM/UA have outdone themselves with this outstanding two-disc set.
The story is well known...Bond goes on a mission to North Korea, goes through trials and tribulations, gains a new mission in life, and pursues the bad guys around the world, coming back full circle to North Korea.  The movie is chock full of what you would expect from a Bond film, beautiful women, fantastic sets, brilliant stunt work, and breathtaking chases (you'll love Bond's new Aston Martin Vanquish).  Director Tamahori's vision and direction is top notch, which shows in almost every frame of this excellent transfer.  The only mentionable flaw I noticed with the movie itself is that some of the CG work (a relatively new addition to Bond films) is painfully obvious in a couple of scenes, and could have possible given a better appearance using more conventional techniques.  But, all things considered, this film was well done and is an excellent addition to the Bond series.
As far as DVD's go, you would be hard pressed to find a better-presented package.  From the moment you start the DVD, it's just one wonderful feature after another.  The animated menus are themed after the movie, and present you with an interactive experience that further draws you into the world of Bond.  On the main disc there are two separate commentaries, one by director Tamahori and executive producer Michael Wilson (more technical in nature), and the other with stars Brosnan (""...and my knee went out right about...here"") and Pike (""It's a good thing this was one of the last scenes we filmed...it's so difficult doing a love scene with somebody you hardly know"") which provides some very nice personal insight into the making of the movie.  But the most innovative and entertaining feature is the one called ""MI6 Data Stream"".  When activated, this feature turns the movie into a kind of ""pop up video"" with little unobtrusive balloons that pop up every few seconds or so displaying tidbits of information, trivia, Bond folklore, etc.  There are even ""incoming video transmissions"", that split the screen to display the movie in a small screen at the corner, while the main screen shows a brief interview, technique review, or ""making of"" segment relating to that particular scene.  Very interesting stuff, even to a non-obsessive Bond fan.  Although, I must admit, that on rare occasion, these video segments would actually detract from my viewing experience, by coming in during a critical scene point.  Even with that in mind, this feature alone made the movie more enjoyable than I felt it had been in the theater.  Disc two is jam packed with features as well...a ""making of"" documentary, scene evolutions, title design feature (so absolutely amazing, it made me wonder why the hadn't used the same techniques for those couple of degraded CG scenes in the movie...it would have been a definite improvement), a feature on ""grading"" the film, image collections, the Madonna ""Die Another Day"" video (and a second ""making of the video"" video), and an overview of the special equipment used in the movie (hosted by the ever-funny John Cleese).  Like I said...a package difficult to match anywhere.
This DVD is a ""must"" for any Bond collector, and an excellent addition for ANYONE's movie collection.  It will provide you with a good 8 hours or so of entertainment (if you use view all the extra features) and is well worth the price of admission.  Maybe they should have just titled the thing ""Buy Another DVD"".",1057795200,2,3638,4.916666666666667
1452570,4,B00005JLBE,"High-tech gadgets, beautiful women, stuff blowing up--this is what James Bond has come to mean.  In this, the 20th film in the series, the tradition continues.  Bond kills people, sneaks around, breaks stuff, sleeps with women--everything every 007 fan expects.  This particular film co-stars Halle Berry and features a climax in a hotel made of ice.
Somehow, 20 films and 5 different Bonds have not made this series grow tiresome yet.  There are still new and exciting things that happen with every film, and still the concept seems fresh enough to continue to be entertaining.  Bond is, and continues to be, a winner.",1057795200,,619,4.970873786407767
1452571,3,B00005JLBE,"Since his first screen appearance in 1962, James Bond seems to have morphed into a type of Barbie doll. In his 21st adventure, ""Die Another Day,"" we see Bond surf on some giant waves off North Korea, man a hovercraft, receive an invisible Aston Martin Vanquish, ride a melting iceberg on a sheet of metal and a parachute, and, don't forget, he also pilots a helicopter before it has an untimely doom.
But you can't blame the series for exaggerating the action scenes lately. Since Sean Connery's reign as Bond, special effects have been moved up a notch, and Bond has only to compete with summer blockbusters such as ""xXx"" and so on and so forth. Bond used to be stylish, slightly unrealistic, and classy. Bond is now a full-out action hero, still stylish, but not quite as classy in terms of execution. I miss Bond walking around in a tuxedo, doing covert operations, out-smarting the baddies with brains instead of brawn. Of course, in the end, it always came down to brawn, such as in ""Goldfinger"" with Bond's fight with Oddjob, but through most of the film, Bond didn't pick up machine guns, punch guys in the face, pilot a helicopter, surf tsunamis, et cetera. But to be quite honest, though Bond has lost some of his classiness, the films are still fun to watch.
In this newest instalment in the ever-continuing series, the film opens up in North Korea, where Bond (undercover) is making a deal with a Korean, in exchange for something called ""conflict diamonds."" I wasn't really listening to everything, mainly because the plots aren't given much thought these days. You have to be quick to catch everything, because the filmmakers just don't have time to fit a plot inside the action film! Bond's mission is compromised; his cover blown. He tries to escape in a hovercraft, but only ends up being thrown in a torture camp for 14 months. Yes, you heard right, Bond is caught in this film. For 14 months. Talk about breaking tradition. Anyway, after 14 months, MI6 becomes worried that Bond is talking, so they make an exchange - they give Zao (a guy who looks like he was running downhill on a diamond mine and fell face-down) to the Koreans, the Koreans give them Bond. But now Bond has a personal vendetta to figure out who blew his cover back 14 months ago, so he traces down Zao at a gene-switching facility; Zao escapes, things go boom. But Bond also finds diamonds with the name Gustav Graves written on them, and traces down Graves--a multi-millionaire--to some exotic location, who knows where, I honestly don't remember. Skip forward on your DVD a few chapters, and you see things start to unfold a bit more. Lotsa things unfold. ;) And if you look at the characters' names, you can pretty much guess who they are. Hint: Graves' last name is ""Graves""--what could that possibly mean? One of the two Bond girls is named Frost--what could that possibly mean?
The other Bond girl in this film is female NSA agent Jinx (Halle Berry), who was born on--guess when--Friday the 13th. She teams up with Bond to hunt down Zao, and turns the film into more of a buddy-buddy picture, rather than a Bond picture. Strong fans might be upset by this, and my personal beefs with Halle Berry aside, I can say that the Bond series needs some new air if it wants to compete with action films; so the whole buddy thing works in this film. As long as they don't overdue it. I don't want Bond teaming up with some loose-cannon agent next time, in tradition of ""Red Heat,"" ""The Hard Way"" and all those other funny films that wouldn't fit Bond.
A few times I missed the idea of Bond strategizing by himself, the quiet man who is cool under pressure. Jinx is a loud-mouth, and there's rarely a moment of silence in this film, whether it be big explosions, big fights, or big mouths. The last truly entertaining Bond film I have seen was 1995's ""Goldeneye,"" Pierce Brosnan's first--and finest--outing as the secret agent. I like ""Goldeneye"" because it seemed buried in Bond's roots--a tribute to all that was good, especially ""Goldfinger."" The locations were exotic, but slightly more realistic than those in the recent films. I liked how Brosnan had the characteristics of Connery's Bond. In all respect, I think Pierce Brosnan is the most worthy successor to Sean Connery, but the main flaw is that the films so often slip into the summer blockbuster slot (i.e. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""The World is Not Enough""), that it's hard to enjoy Pierce's performances as Bond.
""Die Another Day"" entertained me, thrilled me, and wowed me, but I can't really say it did anything great for me. It's the second-best Pierce Brosnan Bond film, and in terms of action it is unbeat by any other Bond film, but I just hope that next time they try something a bit more classy. All in all a film worth seeing, but when compared to ""Goldfinger,"" it is its own seperate series.",1057708800,,4849,4.6395348837209305
1452572,2,B00005JLBE,"Yeah, Bond can surf and flip a car with missels being launched.  Bond surfing reminded me of watching ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" in the old days.  The great blue screen affect.  Don't take me wrong I love the old Bond films but this one is cheesey and ""oh my god get me a bucket"" dramatized.  I know, I know it's entertainment not a movie.  I know not a movie.",1057363200,3,355,4.161764705882353
1452573,4,B00005JLBE,"Pierce Brosnan is back in his 4th outing as the tuxedo clad suave English spy, and looks set to have sealed his name in  connection with Bond, in almost Sean Connery fashion.
Heavily SfX laden action sequences break up the usual one liners, and witty inuendo but this time, for a change there seems to be a real underlying tenacity and gritty toughness to the Bond character. The opening 5 minutes is almost brutal (and a little different in style compared to the usual openings) albeit a tiny bit annoying being overladen with the titles, but apart from that is extremely enjoyable.
A big problem with all Bond movies, is the comparison factor to those that went before, and although Brosnan is definiteley the right man, the plots seem to be relying heavily on older movies. In this outing James must save the World (again) from a madman who is using diamonds, to build a super space laser weapon, to eliminate the free world - sound familiar? Well yes it does, and the story is more than a little similar to Diamonds are Forever.
The next minor criticism would be the high tech gadgets, which are always usually pleasing (if a touch incredible), I found an Aston Martin that becomes invisible, something of a stretch and if one looks back, the really succesful movies in the series have not relied too heavily on high tech, or made them too fantastic. These minor grumbles aside, strap yourself in for plenty of action, high jinks, and good solid acting performances all round. Haley Berry is particularly fetching, and the latest bond girl (who has a brain as well as a body) adding much to the script and story.
The real measure of this movie is it's undoubted success had it NOT been a Bond movie, one feels that if the lead character had been Harold Smith instead of James Bond, the story and production would still have been great, and very watchable, even if the razzmattaz associated with it's release, would have been probably non existent.

Not Pierces best bond, but enjoyable for those action movie nights.

1452575,2,B00005JLBE,"Fantastic action permeates this popcorn feature as Pierce Brosnan reprises his role as over-the-top British spymaster 007.  Obviously a lot of thought and design went into the creation of this picture, which seems to blend more of Star Trek technology with typical action fare, but where it falls short is about halfway through when even the most sophisticated of gadgets can't keep the story afloat.
Has Bond always been over the top with gadgets and cheesey?  Absolutely.  But after the first half of the movie was over, I was hoping it would end abruptly in a blaze of glory.  Bond films have increasingly become more of a forum for product placement than having any self identity.  Brosnan simply does not have the presence, I feel, in this movie to pull it off on his own.
The other acting was mostly painful, with Halle Berry playing it cool through most of the movie.  Pierce isn't too bad himself, but the script leaves much to be desired.  John Cleese plays another thankless role as Q, and our villains are incredibly out of touch with their Muse.  I haven't seen hammier acting since Dudley Do-right (the cartoon).
And so I must confess that I am partial to the Bonds starring Sean Connery, and always will be.  That said, I thought the three previous Bonds were acceptable, if a bit long.  This Bond feels like it tops them all at 132 minutes.  The DVD begins by playing a long preview for the DVD boxed sets, and then a long loading navigation menu, which only added to my time at the start.
The extras on disc two are ample and enough to keep any Bond junkie happy for a quite a while though.  Also, there is some breathtaking cinematography to be seen in this picture, and the sound on my home system was excellent.
If you're a Bond fan, by all means indulge with a warning that the downward spiral of Bond seems to have reached its lowest point yet.  If not, keep this one in the middle of your viewing list for a mindless popcorn movie night.",1057190400,,1959,4.515580736543909
1452576,2,B00005JLBE,"New director, bad result.  There are way too many Matrix-style slow motion/fast camera pans.  It becomes very annoying.
The story is a mishmash of previous Bond movies with a little Ursula Andress (Berre coming out of the water), Goldfinger, Live and Let Die, and others.  The result is a feeling of having been here before.  The interesting parts are fumbled, such as Bond surviving torture at the beginning.  I thought this would make for an interesting movie as he had to deal with 14 months of of pain, but apparently he made a full recovery in about 3 minutes.
Halle Berre has a great body, but it isn't exposed as much as her unconvincing performance as a secret agent.  At times she looks uncoordinated and strained.
The Madonna music is pretty boring as well.  This isn't too much of a shock since few Bond themes are actually hits.
To me, the most memorable part of the movie is Bond telling Q (John Cleese) that such-and-such was ""just a flesh wound.""  In the same scene Cleese says ""I wish I could make you disappear.""  Clearly, references to Monty Python and Fawlty Towers.
I have enjoyed the previous Brosnan Bond movies, but this one was very disapointing.  It's not terrible, but it is definitely missing the Bond feel.",1057104000,2,1234,4.671296296296297
1452577,5,B00005JLBE,"Off the bat, I have to admit this is unlike any previous Bond movie.  It is a mix of a true espionage flick, an action/adventure bonanza, and then the traditional bond formula of women, cars, and destruction.  You knew this Bond was going to be different when you are shocked to learn that Bond has been in a North Korean prison camp for 14 months being beatened and tortured.  I think it took the fantasy away for most of us that Bond is something of a superhuman - and showed that he can be valnerable.  I was so sucked in with his plight that I knew this movie would be different.
The DVD is done extremely well.  I listened it to it in DTS ES which is amazing.  Just watch the opening sequence and you will be amazed at the level of sound engineering MGM did.

1452578,2,B00005JLBE,"If movies were judged solely on special effects, then this would be a great movie.
However, Bond movies have taken a turn for the worse in recent episodes. I think the problem is that the Bond filmakers have ""run"" with the Bond gadgets and escapes a little too much. I mean, now we have James Bond becoming invisible with specialized cars, disappearing into thin air when his enemy is upon him. He's outrunning the entire collapse of the ozone. What can't this guy do?
It's not that we actually expect or want Bond to die, but there just seems to be a regular formula to how Bond gets away each time. As an viewer you just know that a villian's chance is going to be foiled when he finally has Bond, but rather than killing him starts saying lines like ""Did you think you'd escape Bond?"" and proceeds to talk for 10 minutes about all the injustices of his life until Bond thinks of a way to escape. The more the villain seems to ""have"" Bond in his grasp, the more we know that he really doesn't.
Overall there were many grandiose action sequences. Those chase scenes and ""climactic"" finishes in Bond films have become so predictable and over-the-top that it has almost become a little humorous. How long can Bond and a villian be at each other's throats? I know that Bond films are made with the intent of keeping the audience entertained and thrilled, but can't they do it with an equal distribution of action scenes AND story plot. It's hard to believe that they couldn't do that in a movie that was about 2 and a half hours in duration.
If you are a special effects kind of person, this is a great movie and I recommend you give it a try. If you want an in-depth and authentic story line, then I would suggest you pass on this one.",1056672000,7,1734,4.371517027863777

1452660,4,B00005JLBE,"The newest James Bond movie is one of the most glamorous. Die Another Day represents 40 years of James Bond movies. Filled with beautiful and deadly girls, evil villians, thrilling gadgets an adventerous an action filled plots! Die Another Day is no exception, but for the fact that it goes a little too much over the edge. Many have compared it to Moonraker, an are hoping the next film will have the gripping excitement that For Your Eyes Only had. Still, no one can admit that Die Another Day has a certain pizazz of it's own.
The story begins with James Bond going to North Korea. He intercepts an illegal African-conflict diamond smuggler who has arranged to sell them to a Korean Colonel Moon. Bond intercepts the diamonds and places a trigger-bomb inside the case. He then meets Colonel Moon and his associate Zao. However, the plan goes awry when Zao receives a call that exposes Bond. Moon orders Zao to kill Bond, because he must hide the hovercraft weapons from his approaching father, General Moon. Bond explodes the bomb, and Zao falls to the ground with diamond shrapnel across his face. Bond then engages in a high speed hovercraft chase with Colonel Moon through a minefield. Moon crashes over a waterfall and Bond is captured by General Moon. He is then tortured for 14 months to tell what wester person made Colonel Moon betray his country. Bond does not know who the person is, but he knows it is the same one who exposed him. A prison exchange occurs where Bond is traded for Zao. Bond then returns to meet M. she tells him that they had to get him out because the thought he was divulging information. Bond discovers that the same person has set him up again. He breaks out and gets information that Zao is in Cuba. Bond travels there and meets ally Raoul. He then meets the magnificent Jinx in the (original Ursula Andress style.) The two exchange welcomes and the next morning Bond goes to the near Los Organos island, where Zao is receiving gene therapy to alter his identity. He battles Zao and meets the feisty Jinx again, discovering that she is an agent also. Zao escapes, but Bond manages to steal diamonds from a necklace around his neck. He goes back to London and traces the diamonds to Gustav Graves. He gets the equipment and briefing from MI6 and meets and duels Graves in a sword's club. Bond also meets the eye-catching Miranda Frost, (Graves publicist). Bond travels to Iceland to the palace of Gustav Graves, where he discovers the powerful Icarus, a satellite that can direct light on any object. Bond corners Graves and discovers that he is actually Colonel Moon. Bond also thinks that Miranda Frost is a fellow MI6 agent, when she turns out to be the traitor. A thrilling car chase with Bond and Zao follow, with Zao perishing in the palace. Bond and Jinx go aboard the antonov plane to stop Graves and Frost from destroying part of Korea. Jinx matches swords with Frost and kills her. Bond battles Graves and sends him hurlignto his death. Bond and Jinx escape, stop the dangerous Icarus from destroying Korea and fly off for a needed rest. There is also a very nice scene where Miss Moneypenny finally gets her dream come true, (or so she thinks.) The movie ends with Bond and Jinx enjoying the diamonds in a small temple.
The DVD is filled with music videos, documentaries, audio commentaries, scenes, trailers and other tidbits.

-All the gadgets in Q's office.
-The entrance of Jinx like Ursula Andress in Dr. No.
-The Union Jack paarachute used by Graves from The Spy who Loved Me.
-Bond stealing a grape in the health clinic ala' Thunderball.
-If you listen VERY CLOSELY, you can here the original Dr. No gunbarrel music over the music where Bond is getting up from his bed and escaping from containment by M.

1452662,2,B00005JLBE,"Marking the 40th anniversary of James Bond, ""Die Another Day"" was supposed to be the definitive 007 movie, as our favorite secret agent makes his way into the new milenium.  After a three year wait (since ""The World is not Enough"") was it worth it?  Sadly, no.
One of the problems since Brosnan took over the role of Bond is a lack of consistent direction.  Unlike past entries that returned the director year after year (John Glen, Lewis Gilbert, Terrence Young, etc...) all of the new Bond's have a different director at the helm for each outing.  Thus, Bond's newer entries have been lacking in consistent quality.  Lee Tamahori is easily the weakest of the bunch, lacking the true understanding of agent 007 that Apted (TWINE) and Campbell (""Goldeneye"") displayed.
The film starts off rather strongly, with an exciting pre-credit opener.  As a refreshing change of pace, Bond does not walk away successfully, but is instead captured by the Koreans.  Nevertheless, the opening does have it's weaknesses.  The director opts to show Bond's toture scenes while the credits are rolling, which seriously weakens the effectiveness of them.  Coupled with a rather weak title track by Madonna, and the worst pun ever in the history of Bond (Brosnan's uttering ""saved by the bell"" while swinging from one) the early impact of the scene is lost.
The first half of the film tries to present a rather unique twist, as Bond has his 00 status taken away by M.  Sadly, this scene pales in comparison to an earlier effort.  Brosnan and Judi Dench fail to muster up the tension that Dalton and Robert Brown did in a similar scene in ""Licence to Kill""  The reason being ... Brosnan has failed after four efforts to make the charceter of Bond his own.  While he has had strong performances in the past, he is unable to work through a weak script.  Bond as a rouge is not suited to Brosnan's more cinematic approach, and this script would have been much more appropriate for Sean Connery or Tim Dalton.
While the first half of the film is passable, the second half is just plain awful, and rivals ""Diamonds are Forever"" as one of the silliest conclusions ever in a James Bond Film.  It features the worst use of CGI that I have ever seen in a high budget produciton (Brosnan's surfing away from a tidal wave is embarrasing to watch, and looks like technology from the late 70's)  It also resorts back to the comic book style story that marred many of Roger Moores outings.  The ""Icarus"" satelite melting the ice fortress (but not before Bond rescues the girl of course) has no shred of realism to it, and alienates the audience from the action.
On a side note, the use of sexual innuendos has crossed (actually leapt) over the line from witty to juvenile.  Halle Berry eying Brosnan's crotch saying ""that's a moutful"" supposedly in reference to his being an ornithologist is like something out of an 80's teen movie.  Do you ""get the thrust"" of how I feel about this movie?
On a more positive note, most of the cast in this film are quite strong.  Stephens, Pike, and Yune form a solid trio of villians (Pike's character of Miranda Frost turning traitor was a nice and suprising twist)  The three are strong actors, and make the most of their performances despite the weak script.  Ironically the most heavily billed star (besides Brosnan) Berry, proves to be the most unsatisfying.  While it is nice to see a Bond woman in a strong role, though it certainly is nothing new (see ""The Spy who Loved Me"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"") Berry's character tires to share the limelight with 007 (even on the release poster)  This is a mistake!  Bond should always be the main star!
Berry is a fine actress, but does not live up to the hype as a Bond girl.
As far as Brosnan goes, he fails to muster a satisfying performance in this, his fourth entry.  After seeing his strong showing in the prior Bond outing (TWINE) I had high hopes for him.  Unfortunately is seems that he may never be able to properly convey the true 007, as conceived by his creator Ian Flemming.  While he has occasional moments of greatness (the hotel scene where he is offered a massage for instance) as a whole he seems more content to present Bond as an action hero, than a spy.  Then again, with his box office numbers being as high as they are, perhaps that is what audiences want.
Overall though, as much as I wanted to like ""Die Another Day"", in the end I had to recognize it for what it was, a weak entry that has little in common with the early Bond's.  This is easily the weakest Bond movie since ""Moonraker"".",1056412800,,4565,4.5793357933579335

Bond is my man--smart, alert, accomplished, cool and funny. Not at all like Austin Powers, which brings me to what I miss most about the new ""Bond.""  Ever since Timothy Dalton's Bond the humor has gone right out. Bond does not have cheesey humor ...Austin Powers has cheesey humor. Bond has a dry, ascerbic and sometimes satirical wit. Bond's humor is more of an aside. Austin Power's is a side show. There's a difference here folks.

1452664,3,B00005JLBE,"What the heck has happened to Bond?? I watched it and all I could think about is how americanized blast em' up it has gotten! Really watch this movie and see how Bond handles things and you will see that the movie is a Die Hard with a different name. I love the James Bond series, but this does not feel like a Bond movie. Now on the fair side, it did have some ups. Such as it paying homage to the other bond movies, and it having some very clever twists. I enjoyed the fencing scene because I am a sabre fencer and it was very, very well done. The villian and henchmen were classic bond which is great. So the really the only ""un-bond"" in this movie is Bond himself. Other than that, the girls, the henchmen and the plot is great. One problem though was the leaders, M didn't even try to rescue him and the american dude talks like a street urchin! That and of course Bond not escaping prison! He is James Bond! He can get out of any prison, but for some unknown reason, this worn-down prison seems to stump him. So he just hangs out until they trade him, then he doesn't make a daring rescue when he is with the general in the jail! Oh well, as long as the Bond movies soon to follow are not as americanized (when I say that, it means things blowing up in almost every fight or action scene). So buy, or rent? Well it may have its obvious flaws, but it is a pretty good action movie so I would have to say buy it. Now if you are a person who watches movies for realisticness then it probably isn't a good buy because the movie is somewhat unbelievable(invisible car and the palace made of ice). Still you will be at the edge of your seats during the last two fight scenes, so give it a chance but do not compare it to the rest of the series (Well except License to Kill because then Die Another Day will seem like the best movie in the world).

It is hard to make a franchise where every film is basically a rehashing of every other film appear new and interesting, and a few of the inside jokes in this one were amusing. However I can't see why they thought making Halle Berry a Bond Girl was a good idea, I have yet to see a film in which she added more to the film than a mannequin would. Her delivery is awful, and it almost appears that they write dialogue specifically for her to sound terrible reciting. The stunts and action were good, although some of the blue screens were glaringly obvious. The dialogue throughout was sub par. However I do have to say at least it wasn't tomorrow never dies.

1452667,3,B00005JLBE,"This is the 20th James Bond film.  I have watched very few of the Bond series, mostly the last three.  Compared to Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and The World is Not Enough...this movie is gold.  I thought the previous three movies were not very good at all, and this is a big step in the right direction.  Pierce Brosnan is believable as James Bond and he is the image of who I think Bond is.  The addition of Oscar Winner Halle Berry (Monster's Ball) adds a little bit of class to the movie.  Considering that this is an improvement over the past three films, and some of the quality actors working in the movie, I was disappointed.
Die Another Day has all the gadgets and action that we have come to expect from the James Bond series...yet it seems to lack some sort of emotional core.  I know that James Bond is the hero and that I should care what happens to him, but I just couldn't.  The movie was kind of interesting, but it just felt empty.
The movie opens with Bond doing a spy mission in North Korea.  His cover is blown and though he attempts to escape, he is ultimately captured and tortured.  He is held for 14 months.  Because of the length of time he was a prisoner and some of the political situations in the world, M (Judi Dench) was reluctant to trade for Bond.  She does, but rescinds Bond's 00 status.  Bond escapes the hospital wing of Her Majesty's Secret Service and takes on a personal mission to kill whomever blew his cover.  This takes James from Hong Kong to Cuba to England to a secret base and during this hunt he meets a woman named Jinx (Halle Berry), who happens to be an American NSA agent.  Together, Jinx and Bond team up to fight a genetically changed North Korean who has found a way to harness the power of the sun into a weapon.
Some action sequences were fairly impressive as were the gadgets that Bond gets to use (his car is really, really nice),  but I have to fall back on the thought that I just didn't care what was going on and the movie just felt empty.  There was more to it than the last few Bond movies, but it still failed as a movie.

1452669,3,B00005JLBE,"The James Bond film series has entered its fifth decade, making it by far the longest running franchise in film history. Kids who went to see ""Die Another Day"" were sitting alongside grandparents who saw the original movies [""Goldfinger"", Dr. No"", etc.] when they themselves were kids. This newest installment is unlikely to be on many people's list of the best Bond movie ever made. It lies somewhere in the middle. What it may best remembered for is its sometimes ridiculous attempts to align Bond with today's teenagers' cinematic tastes. The car chases, the explosions and the special effects in general tend to overwhelm the witty dialog that has always been one of the movies' trademarks. The result is a film that tries too hard to be all things to all people. It isn't that it isn't fun; it's that it isn't as much fun as many of the earlier efforts. This isn't to say that the franchise is dead. It may well outlive all of us. Any series this long-lived goes through periods when it has to evolve. This has happened to Bond before and will happen to Bond again.
The plot of ""Die Another Day"" concerns the evil son [Toby Stephens] of a North Korean leader. Thanks to the wonder of DNA surgery [whatever that is}, the guy has transformed himself into an evil European who has made a fortune in the diamond trade. He has used his money to launch a satellite that has a powerful laser beam capable of mass destruction. It is up to 007, aided by CIA agent Jinx Jordon [Halle Berry] to stop this madman's plan for world domination.
Pierce Brosnan gives his usual competent performance as Bond, and Halle Berry is lovely to look at. Stephens almost steals the show as the bad guy, but Bond movies are famous for their memorable villains.
There's not much going on in this movie - no subtext, no hidden meaning. It's pure escapist entertainment. There's nothing to think about. It's a ride you either enjoy or you don't.",1056067200,,1921,4.603498542274052

There's barely enough time between things blowing up and unnecessary ""bullet time"" effects to tell a coherent five minute story. Clearly, the producers of this film do not realize that spending even half as much money and attention on the story would have saved them about $50 million in special effects.
What happened to character development? 500 extra explosions is not a substitute for good dialogue, suspense or purposeful action. Even Goldeneye (with a remarkably similar superweapon) had more believable characters. And The Thomas Crown Affair was far sexier with great plot twists and momentum.
The lack of chemistry between Brosnan and Berry is stunning. They're both likable actors, but have nothing to work with here.

The movie starts out in the typical manner, with the mini-mission before the main movie starts, a top secret mission to North Korea to impeed a Colonel's son from obtaining rare diamonds for a project. Only this time there is no narrow escape for James Bond when he is betrayed by someone inside MI6. No free rides on a moving plane, no hidden parachutes, and no fast cars are within his reach. He is captures and tortured for 14 long months.
Almost as if by a miracle, he is finally traded for a prisoner that the American/Brittish agencies managed to get ahold of, a soldier who was caught in the explosion when the cache case of diamonds exploded, leaving several diamonds permanantly embedded in his face.
He is expelled from active duty by M, but he finds that it only frees him up to act indepentently, where he joins up with a beautiful woman named Jinx (Halle Berry), but will she jinx his entire mission, or bring him the greatest luck he's had to date?

Bond is actually captured and tortured following a traitor on the inside setting him up. The action and sets are spectacular. The story was a little rough to follow and the characters not as developed as a typical bond movie. At this time, I'm leaving this one as 15th, which puts it ranked between Moonraker (14) and The Spy Who Loved Me (16). This would also leave it ranked as my least favorite of the 4 brosnan films.

1452744,5,B00005JLBE,"Incredible movie. I have only listened to the first hour of Pierce's commentary. Semi-humorous. As a bond movie, though, this may be the best of Brosnan's films. Lots of great settings, interesting story (an actual story). Great action sequences.
The packaging is excellent. It is a double-dvd set full of extras. Two sets of commentary tracks. It is a worthy addition to any collection.",1055894400,2,387,5.0625
1452745,4,B00005JLBE,"It's the worst thing that could possibly happen to a virtually immortal character like 007.  James Bond has been captured and tortured by the North Koreans for fourteen months! He is eventually traded by the government for the release of a terrible terrorist, whose face was disfigured by Bond's previous encounter with him.  Enraged by this transaction, M strips Bond of his license to kill (again), so Bond decides to go solo and kill the freed terrorist.  But Bond soon discovers a greater plot that could tip the balance of power in Korea...
Like any old Bond film, there's plenty of action, exotic locations, and pretty girls about.  But what makes this film so great is its contemporary style and advanced special effects.  From an invisible car to smashing glaciers, there's no Bond film that has such sophisticated effects as these.
The movie's storyline not wholly unique, as it incorporates aspects from previous films such as ""License to Kill"" and ""Diamonds are Forever"".  But the characters are quite unique, and include a girl who's a lot like Bond himself, a disfigured terrorist with a face studded with diamonds, and a wealthy knighted entrepeneuer who's not all he seems (this guy comments that he never gets furious, but then as he duels with Bond, becomes enraged!).
The film is generally entertaining.  I wouldn't say that it's the best Bond, despite its advanced effects and interesting characters, but it's worth seeing.",1055808000,,1442,5.00836820083682
1452746,1,B00005JLBE,"DAD is the  worst Bond film of all time. I won't go to far into how unoriginal it was, (taking scenes from other Bond movies and putting them together to make one bad movie), but Pierce Brosnan's performance was territble. Now don't get me wrong I like Pierce, but he's just not James Bond. He in no way resembles Ian Flemings character, not the way all of his successors did. It is time for Pierce to step down and hand the role over to somebody like Adrian Paul. Also the movies in general need a lot. James Bond is a Spy not a superhero, he has to stop saving the world all the time and start acting like a Spy. The new movies, which started with Goldeneye, are victimes of too much action not enough suspense. Up until Goldeneye the James Bond series was a Spy Drama, now suddelny its a pointless USA original action Flick. Ian Flemming is probably turning over in his grave watching what has become of his creation.",1055635200,2,920,4.348837209302325
1452747,4,B00005JLBE,"Brosnan just might be the best Bond after Connery. He hasn't made a bad one yet, and ""Die Another Day"" is no exception. While not his best one, (that was ""Goldeneye,"" his first) ""Die Another Day"" is definitely his biggest. The first hour is the best, with Bond getting captured by Koreans and tortured for over a year. Then when he's released, he's disowned by MI6 and must clear his name. Now, Bond wants revenge on whoever betrayed him, as well as diamond-faced Zao. His trail leads him to Gustav Graves, an adventurous rich boy who never sleeps, and isn't who he seems to be. The second hour has the feel of the better Roger Moore movies and is loaded with action and even a little comedy. Sadly, this second half isn't as good as the first and this keeps the film from being perfect. Brosnan is great as Bond and feels more comfortable in the role here as ever. Halle Berry is Jinx, an American agent working on the same case. She's a great love interest for Bond and would be great in a possible spin-off, but that's what they said about Michelle Yeoh in ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""

1452748,2,B00005JLBE,"This is one of the worst Bond movies I have ever seen. The plot was not all that bad, which is why I give it two stars, but the acting... my God, could it be any worse? I mean, Halle Berry had won an Oscar a year ago: why did she need to take on such a lame role? Sure she's got the looks, and she looks great, but that's about it: the dialogues between her and Brosnan are stuck in the same place of those cheesy ambiguous conversations between the super-agent and former Bond girls, only that it's been 20 movies now, and we're in 2003.
There are a few pieces of contemporary action with effects that go in line with today's technology, yes. But what's up with the Robocop suit the villain wears toward the end? Or the Darth Vader-like performance??? All in all, it was a waste of money. You're better off going with some of the earlier Sean Connery Bond movies, if you absolutely must see one of these.

1452809,4,B00005JLBE,"First off, I'm not a die hard Bond fan.  I don't memorize every single line in the movies, or own the entire series on DVD.  Nor am I a complete non Bond fan who says, ""M who?"" I'm in the middle of the fan world.
I was very curious to see how Bonds 20th adventure would turn out.  So we got the DVD, popped it in, and watched the film.  It was good, but I have serious gripes about the first half of the film.
First off, the first half of the movie is quite dissapointing for me.  Bond infiltrates North Korea to do...well...uh...stop some evil rich kid from getting diamonds...I think.  Then of course, things go wrong and he defeats approximatly 140 million bad guys with exposions, mines, flame throwers, and machine guns going off like mad, and of course he gets through it withought a scratch.  Then things go terriably wrong, and he is in a sense, betrayed by his agency.  Then he decides to go on a quest for revenge.
During his quest, Bond travels to exotic locales, such as North Korea, Hong Kong, Cuba, Spain, Britan, and Iceland.  However, his trips to the first 5 places are quite boring (Aside from Korea).  Yes, there are guns, explosions, and semi-naked women, but they just don't feel right.  The lab fight in Cuba seems kind of put on, and is there just to fill time.  Liekwise, the sword fight in Britan seems to go on for...ev....er.
However, the 2nd act of the movie (Which begins when Bond heads to Iceland) really makes up for the rest of the film.  Here, the action sequences don't feel tackled on, and are exciting to watch.  The car chase is really cool, along with the Uber-ray of death.(Really cool).  The location for the final action scene (Which I won't ruin here), is one of the best in the series, rivaling the nuclear sub at the end of the last move, and the action that takes place is top notch.
Hale Berry does a good job as the agent Jinx, and does quite well for a supporting charachter, especially during a sword fight.  She also has some funny lines, (""I guess we'll die rich!"").  The main villians are boo hiss types, and do a good job at being evil.  John Cleese also does a bang up job as Q, and is quite funny.  The special effects are quite good, especially near the end, with explosions galore.  I also enjoyed all the refrences to previous films (Lasers, hovercraft, etc.)
However, there are some severe flaws in logic and other things.  For example, if the sun is approximatly 1.9 trillion degrees in temperature, then how come its heat (Minor story spoiler) cannot melt the ice palace in seconds? (End minor story spoiler).  The dialoge can also be a bit hard to understand in places withought subtitles.  And Bonds mission at the begining of the movie is never really explained.  What was he supposed to do?
Overall, the first half of the film is a bit of a dissapointment, but the 2nd act of the movie really makes up for it.  I would recomend this move for action fans, and Bond fans alike.
The good:
Lots of explosions, guns, and semi naked women
Phenominal final action sequence
Halle Berry is good as Jinx
lots of locations
The not so good:
First half of movie is dissapointing
some dialoge is a bit hard to understand
at times, the action scenes can reach a ""Yeah right"" level
some wierd logic flaws involving big hot death rays
Summary:
The second half is great, but the first half is not so good.",1055462400,,3353,4.439542483660131
1452810,4,B00005JLBE,"I got a chance the other day to see the new James Bond movie, Die Another Day. I thought it was great.  Halle Berry was a great costar, obviously; she also has legit action movie credentials, having been in the X-Men movies.  I haven't actually seen a lot of Bond movies, but I think this one generally fit the bill: sexy ladies, car chases, gadgets, goof-ups, miraculous finishes and the like.  Generally entertaining, although a bit long at two hours and twenty minutes.  There was a cameo by Madonna (which I didn't understand; she was in the movie for all of 2 minutes, what's the point?), as well as John Cleese, who made a short but hilarious impact on the film. Incidentally, I think Pierce Brosnan is a great Bond; before he even got the part, that was how I generally pictured him in my mind.",1055462400,,801,4.465753424657534
1452811,5,B00005JLBE,"I'm a really huge fan of goldeneye, but what can I say other than it kicks butt...As for this movie it ties with Goldeneye.  I admit that the past Pierce Brosnan movies haven't been that great but don't let this movie fool you.  It's a great action/adventure filled with a BUNCH of extras, deleted scenes, etc.  As for the story line, alot of it is unrealistic but its worth watching.  Although I can do without Madonnas theme song which really gets annoying after awhile but thats what the fast forward button is for.  It's definately worth buying if your a Bond fan or just getting into the Bond movies.",1055462400,,605,4.513761467889908
1452812,2,B00005JLBE,"But the whole package doesn't seem to satisfy.  What made the other Bond films succeed is not just the action, but the style.  And it's getting increasingly hard to find style in the Bond series.  There are some reasons for this:
First, Pierce Brosnan.  Whatever else can be said about Roger Moore, it never really seemed like he was trying too hard: to be cool, ruthless, sexy, etc.  With Brosnan, you always get the sense that he's trying too hard.  His face grits and contorts and the viewer thinks, okay, we get it; you're a tough guy.  Moore (who never really received the credit he deserved) understood that less was more.
Connery is, of course, Connery.  And even George Lazenby was kind of funny.  ""This never happened to the other fellah.""  Timothy Dalton, I'll admit, lacked the presence necessary to the Bond franchise.  But I'd rank Brosnan behind the rest.
Second, a lack of imagination.  For example, in Die Another Day, I'd hoped for a bit of interesting, dark quirkiness when I saw Michael ""Mr. Blonde"" Madsen.  But no, he was totally wasted and not one good line came out of him, I suspect, for fear that it would upstage Brosnan.  Halle Berry was also pretty much wasted.  Her portrayal as the American agent ""Cleopatra Jones"" like Jinx was one note and bordered on insulting.  (""Your mama!"")
And the foreplay dialogue between her and Bond was just witless.  Grown people in the act of seduction simply do not talk like that.  Even in a movie that's more or less fantasy, the dialogue should be believable.  Contrast Berry and Brosnan's eye rolling ""there's a mouthful"" exchange with Connery and the beautiful French agent standing outside the chateau.  She says, ""Anything else our office can do for you?""  And he looks at her as if she were a delectable meal and says with a sly grin, ""Later, perhaps.""  One is subtle and chauvinistic and clever, and the other just makes you groan.
Third, the action.
Swordfight between Bond and badguy could have been better.  The director should have studied the swordfight in ""The Great Race""; I think it would have been more effective had it been more subtle and spent less time smashing things up.  Also, it would have been more effective if Bond simply had not displayed any emotion throughout.  As it was, the scene was okay though when badguy grabbed the Japanese sword and ran at Bond I couldn't help but think of those hilarious fights between Inspector Clouseau and Kato in the ""Pink Panther"" films.
There was something unsatisfying about the car chase too.  Beautiful vehicles, but I wish it had been more raw.  The gadgets, in my view, always endanger a decent car chase.  Too much and it just becomes a matter of you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  The best chases in the Bond series almost always don't involve gadget cars.  Think of Moore driving the pathetic Citroen in ""For Your Eyes Only"".  He uses his wits in dispatching the bad guys in their considerably more powerful Peugots.  Or, picture that small chase with Bond in the stolen Alfa Romeo GTV6 in ""Octopussy"".  Short, but pretty gripping.  The problem with high tech Aston Martins is they put all the money and effort into building them and then they're forced to use them to the full in the film to justify the expense.
For my money, I rank the footchase in ""For Your Eyes Only"" where Bond runs up the steps in the tunnel to cut off the fellah trying to get away in the Mercedes 450SEL as one of the most well choreographed action scenes in all the movies.  It ends with Bond catching the man, shooting him through the windshield, then booting him and his disabled car off the cliff.  In so doing, it demonstrates what makes Bond Bond.  Determined and ruthless when he needs to be.  And the scene did not require the use of one gadget.
All in all, the Brosnan Bond films are not bad, per se.  But they're lacking overall.  I think the producers need to stop and think about changing the formula.  In this one, they demonstrated some courage in putting Bond behind bars.  But it didn't go anywhere from there.  I think it's time for a ""From Russia with Love"" or ""For Your Eyes Only"" type bona-fide spy story.",1055462400,,4142,4.60875512995896
1452813,4,B00005JLBE,"Without any doubts, Die Another Day is a genuine grand movie by unlimited budget backing up. It is tremendously entertaining for new Bond's fans. This is the 'Bond film by the book,' containing destructive actions, beautiful girls, creative evils and martini. There are few twists to make the movie called 'spy' but they are not enoungh to a classic Bond.
Halle Berry is very sexy and very American just as director Tamahori wanted her to be. Rosamund Pike is 'gorgeous' but too innocently beautiful to be an evil lady if to be compared with Sophie Marceau in The World is Not Enough (that's why it's out of print). Picture and sound qualities are perfect, the dvd comes with 6.1 sound. Overall this dvd is worth adding to your collection.",1055462400,,739,4.736434108527132
1452814,2,B00005JLBE,"As with any Bond movie, the film/fan community's pretty split on ""Die Another Day,"" which for me was way too much sex, not enough foreplay. If the movie's villain wants undergo radical, identity changing plastic surgery, fine. But don't give us a marbled-mouthed Cuban exporter whom we can hardly understand to explain it.
Things just....happen in this Bond movie. And they happen for more than two hours. The movie is one event after another, no time for drinks or golf, or even gadgets; whereas Q (now John Cleese) used to get a full ten minutes or so to show us the spy stuff, he now only gets three shoehorned in. Even Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) gets tossed aside. We might as well not even have a second Bond girl in the movie; although there is one in Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) she does little  more than look guilty and keep score.
And for whom were they pushed out of the picture? Why, Halle Berry, who looks fantastic but hasn't spoken such stupid dialogue since ""B.A.P.S."" Berry plays an American spy named Jinx, although the movie waits a good hour before actually spelling it out. Again, there...just...isn't...any...time...we...must...get...to...the...next...scene.
What is there time for?
Two painfully goony villains in Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) and Zao (Rick Yune), who are so smug and devoid of humor, or even pathos, that their deaths are a relief, not a release.
A long, drawn-out plot about North Korea, DMZ land mines and a space weapon right out of ""Spies Like Us"" to blow them up.
The most obligatory, lame sex scenes, especially with Berry, in Bond history, save a 'virtual"" tryst between Bond and Moneypenny that actually feels...human.
The worst action scene in a Bond film (that'd be the one where Bond parasails off an iceberg to escape the oncoming tidal wave that was formed....oh, what difference does it make).
Another bitter-beer-face performance from Judi Dench as M.
The longest, most will-it-ever-end car chase sequence I've ever seen (if they go around one more corner of that ice palace...)
It was a terminally boring experience, but the biggest disappointment is Berry, who, when compared to, say, Thandie Newton from ""Mission: Impossible 2,"" looks like she just walked out of stock model factory. There are few women in the world this drop dead beautiful,  but numerous interviews over time have shown Berry to be one of the standup, insecure, mannered women of Hollywood (car crash notwithstanding) and she is not particularly well equipped to get down and bawdy like a Bond girl should. Denise Richards was better, for crying out loud.
""Die Another Day"" also looks cheap. Why? Was it spent on Berry? On the giant ice palace? What? The CGI certainly isn't worth a salt.
I've left out Pierce Brosnan purposefully, because he seems without much control over this plane crash. The man says his lines, a bit more sternly than he used to, he dances his dance and then fires his gun. The movie opens with Bond's capture in North Korea and his eventual 14-month torture before he's released. He carries that grudge through the whole movie, and never has the role been less fun.
I can appreciate a darker 007. Every so often, it has to go there, as it did in the underrated ""License To Kill,"" which is still the best Bond movie in 20, 25 years. But darker, to me, means a more conventional plot, which ""License To Kill"" featured (drug lords, vendettas, dark, stormy nights). This Bond is dark, and it's ludicrous. It's like being trapped in the circus house with a bunch of miserable, stiff freaks.

1452816,4,B00005JLBE,"So what does Brosnan do in response to ""experts"" who say he doesn't have what it takes to play James Bond? He makes like an athlete and improves his game. I can't believe people who compare these movies to the Austin Powers series, when it's clear that the Powers flicks are an intentional parody of 007. In this movie, we have a fanatical North Korean Colonel who builds a weapon that isn't a laser, per se--it amplifies solar energy to use as a heat ray. And he uses it to clear the minefield in the DMZ in a way Stalin never considered--Ole Joe said you clear a minefield by marching men through it. There's just one problem, though. The Colonel is son to a high-level General who thinks he's been killed in an earlier commando attack by Bond, but the mainstream Korean military isn't into whatever comes next. For example, what if South Korea asks the U.S. to fire nuclear missiles? There's the usual array of high tech gadgets, like turning Bond's Aston Martin into a stealth car. Also the Colonel's flying jumbo jet command post, but Bond's cold-start of a chopper that he and Jinx escape from the jumbo in freefall defies credibility. John Cleese as Q's successor is just as fussy and has just as low a threshold for Bond's child-at-play treatment of his inventions as the original Q had. Judi Dench as the modern M is still nowhere near as supportive of her agent as the original M was, which means as supportive as she should be. If I had a job as dangerous as Bond's but had a boss as unappreciative as this M, I'd be spending time at placement services between missions. Halle Berry's role as American agent Jinx is a keeper in terms of more Bond films, but as far as a Jinx series, no way. Berry has too many credentials as an actress to settle for what would end up as a B film series that would wind up on USA Network. My main critique is with the menu setup for the extra features. It's a bit too thematic, to the expense of viewers being able to tell what we're going to be getting when we click onto a selection. I'm not saying it has to be as basic white-on-blue-just-the-facts as the built-in menus on our VCRs, but there's such a thing as too clever.

1452818,4,B00005JLBE,"One thing for sure about ""Die Another Day"": the writers well understood (and paid tribute to) the great Bond movies of the past.  The end result is a movie that, while not perhaps as great as the films it honors, certainly takes its place as one of the best modern Bond films made.
Nearly every previous Bond classic is represented here: there is, of course, the acknowledged nod of the head to Dr. No and the famous bikini sequence.  But you don't have to look very hard to see many other references.  There are depressuring fights on a plane (""Goldfinger""), a great car chase on ice sequence (""The Living Daylights""), Bond leaving the service as a rogue (""License to Kill""), diamond weapon in the sky (""Diamonds are Forever""), the list goes on and on (I would even venture to say there is a tribute of sorts to the foolishness that went on during Roger Moore's Bond days; the unbelievable wind surfing stunt Bond pulls about halfway through is exactly the sort of silliness that Moore did all the time).
Cynics might say this is true of any Bond film nowadays; they are so derivative they resort to stealing from themselves.  But I don't think that's the case here.  It's pretty clear the writers knew what they were doing when John Cleese even quotes some of the great ""Q"" lines from the past in his excellent sequence where he provides Bond his new Aston Martin (and now we've come full circle there as well, returning to the car that made Bond famous).
I'm not a big Halle Berry fan, but she's very good here.  More to the point are the villians.  Toby Stephens and Rick Yune are terrific, as so is Pierce, who ironically is hitting his stride and seems totally comfortable in a role he's soon to give up.
If you've enjoyed the great Bond movies in the past, you're sure to appreciate this one.  Even those new to Bond should have fun with the action and adventure.",1055289600,47,1870,4.511834319526627

1452919,3,B00005JLBE,"Latest installment of 007 manages to honor the traditional Bond elements while also keeping stride with modern times. The story centers around Bond's attempt to track down a North Korean Army officer who is illegally receiving diamonds smuggled out of South Africa and using the resulting wealth to build a satellite that will harness the power of the sun. Bond also has his sights on a mystery figure inside the British government who betrayed him, resulting in his being imprisoned and tortured in North Korea for 14 months. The film makes a few weak attempts at humour but overall has a very dark and somber tone. The opening sequence showing 007's torture at the hands of his North Korean captors is quite intense compared to the traditional Bond formula where he's rarely in true peril. The scenes set in the villian's 'house of ice' are really spectacular and to me are the film's best moments. The one truly cheesy scene in this movie is the cartoonish image of Bond riding a makeshift surfboard on the waves from a melting iceberg. The shot is phoney-looking beyond belief and downright silly. Halle Berry does an OK job as an American CIA agent who teams up with Bond. Madonna shows up for a totally lame, wooden cameo that the film would be better without. I'm also not a fan of her monotonous techno-flavored theme song for the film. Overall, not a bad movie and should certainly please Bond diehards if they're not put off by the film's gritty, somber feel.

HORRIBLE sexual eneundos that only one who hasn't had sex in about 25 years would find amusing. The villians are laughable and the realism is non-exsistent. The beauty of the old James Bond movies were that it was real senarios. Now with invisible cars who are sliding all over suddenly can stop on a dime on pure ice when you need to avoid that villian just at the end. Also this film uses a ""cool"" effect attempting to mimic matrix special effects with slow motion and quick fast forwarding. Only problem is they use it about every 3 minutes. If this doesnt give you a headache, not sure what will. So a good chuck of the movie's visuals are more distracting and unpleasant than visually pleasing. The plot line is laughable at best, and the dialouge is Sci Fi channel worthy. ... ""oh i have a hundred gadgets that i will now use"".  I may sound partial to the old Bond movies, but in reality I own none of them, but the value of them is still fairly decent. Die Another Day has to be the worst James Bond movie to date. Honestly, the plots seem dry and boring and they are running out of things to do. With 7 hours of bonus footage..one may slip into a coma trying to stay interested through it. Less features, more focus on a plotline and diolouge would be a wise move for the next movie. This one ain't worth picking up. 2/5 stars.",1055203200,2,1625,4.275974025974026

I'm a big Monty Python fan and this aspect just brightened the movie even more... i just thought Halle Berrie's character could have been better developed... she did have an excellent fight scene though... and Brosnan finally did a great Bond movie besides Goldneye...

1452923,2,B00005JLBE,"While this DVD easily sports the highest picture and sound quality of the entire Bond DVD series, it has a few annoying flaws.  The first, and most distracting, is that the very powerful DTS audio track is noticeably out of sync with the video for nearly half the movie.  I've tested two different DVDs out on three separate home theatre setups, and this flaw showed on them all.  The other detraction is the fact that MGM broke the running DVD jacket layout design it had going for the Bond series.  Now I have a very nice looking set of 19 Bond DVDs on my bookshelf that is ruined by this DVD.  Add these faults to the fact that 'Die Another Day' was the worst Bond made since 'Moonraker', and this DVD is pretty worthless.",1055116800,,725,4.380597014925373
1452924,2,B00005JLBE,"I have been a Bond fan pretty much all my life, and while this is not the WORST film, it is close.
Starting with the most trivial, Brosnan is wearing the ugliest haircut I've ever seen on him.  Either he is older than I think, or the haircut ages him.  Everty time I looked at him, i wanted to say WHO DID THAT HAIRCUT? FIRE HIM/HER!
Now for the actual movie.  The movie consisted of scenes strung together with even less finesse than usual.  Part of this impression was attributable to the obvious derivative nature of many scenes.  The viewer says, ""OH, this is the bathing suit scene from Dr. No""  ""This is the laser torture scene from Dr. No"", and so on.  While some of these scenes were clever, they detracted from the cohesivehess of the film.
The invisible car was hokey but could have been OK if used cleverly. It wasn't.  In fact, the whole invisibility gag was ruined by the fact that the  villain IMMEDIATELY spotted the car with his heat-detecting gadget.  So what's the point of the invisibility?
The climactic scene was, as another reviewer said, downright embarrassing.  Instead of a coherent, if impossible, sequence, they appear to have strung together a bunch of unconnected snippets of ice, water, and car, added some ""vroom"" noises, and --voila! a really bad scene.  I have been pondering why it was SO bad, and i think it has to do with the jumbledness.  In a good Bond chase scene, things happen sequentially -- ski down mountain, jump of chalet roof, lose one ski, etc -- but here there were no ""events"" in the chase and no feeling of sequence.  I think that matters - there was no thought put into it.
Of course there was no plot to speak of, but I think we sign on for that .
I really  missed the format of hi speed opening sequence, credits, then seemingly unrelated story.
Halle Berry was as great as she could be, given not much to work with.
not the absolute worst, but down there.",1055116800,,1910,4.463976945244957
1452925,4,B00005JLBE,"I've avoided most of the installments of the James Bond franchise for several years now. I was very saddened by the reliance on sex and gadgets and just plain silliness to carry the movie rather than tell an interesting and feasible story. I've limited my viewings to just those premiering a new actor in the title role.

Having said that, I just viewed ""Die Another Day"" expecting the same, and was pleasantly surprised. The movie has its good and bad points, but its mostly good, and here's why.

Anyone who has read the Bond novels by Ian Flemming knows alot about the character - and it has little to do with sex, cars, and the like. Its more about duty and living with the knowledge that you are going to die and soon in the line of duty. In ""Casino Royale"" (the first Bond novel), Flemming tells us that Bond intends to die with as little money in his bank account as possible, which is why he spends it on wine, women, and song. This movie takes that to heart, showing a man more interested in doing the job rather than completing sexual conquests.

Second, the cheese has been kept to a minimum. There are the one-liners that are expected, but there is little cleavage and refrshingly absent are the ""Bond Girls"" - a term coined for the brothel of scantilly clad women that would appear in each new film. Even the ample Ms. Berry manages to keep covered most of the time.

Third, there are many references to the golden age of Bond. Holle Berry walking out of the surf wearing the trademark wide white belt and diving knife first brandishd by Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No""; A tour by the new ""Q"" (John Cleese) where many old props are cluttered about - see how many you can spot. Then there are many plot elements borrowed from past Bond films, yet used in new ways. Its fun just to point them out. Note this is not done from a lack of ideas, the movie does stand on its own, tho at times it does play like a Bond Anniversary Special.

The plot is engaging from the first frame - and I'll not spoil it for anyone by mentioning any of it here. Its not the usual Bond movie - at least not since Flemming passed away - but I'm happy to say that Bond Is Back, and I'm looking forward to seeing the next installment at the theatre.",1055116800,,2231,4.315035799522673
1452926,1,B00005JLBE,"As other reviewers have commented, the Bond films used to be trendsetters in dictating the shape of action films to come; now they just copy the formula of most of the recent big budget action films - over-reliance on special effects, ridiculously overdone stunts and exploits from the main character, and story very definitely taking a back seat.  Now I like great special effects, but ever since CGI became an effective tool for filmakers, they've gone on a kind of adolescent FX wankfest.  And I like great stunts too, but the action simply cannot be allowed to get so outrageous that it torpedoes suspension of disbelief, which is precisely what happens here.
Remember when Bond was a very human character?  Think back to films like ""From Russia With Love"".  Remember Bond's fight with Red Grant on the Orient Express?  There he was, disarmed, being held at gunpoint by a vicious psychopath who had killed his only ally on the train, and who just managed to get the drop on him, and there was no help in sight.  Bond used his wits and a very low key gadget supplied by Q to get even up the odds.  The ensuing fight on the train was not choreographed to depict the fighters with ballet like grace.  It was not shown in super slo mo.  There were no huge explosions and there was no FX tour de force.  And it was one of the best fight scenes in the entire series.  It was gripping and suspenseful.  You felt like Bond was really in serious trouble, and he could get killed.  It was believable.  The whole film was believable.
Sadly, you can't say that about this movie.  It's all just... ludicrous.  The weapons and gadgets belong in a Star Trek movie, not a James Bond film.  Bond himself is no longer a human character, with whom audiences can identify; he's a superhero in a tux instead of spandex and a cape.  Suspension of dibelief has gone straight out the window.  The FX wanking and gadgets don't conceal the fact that the story and characters are pitifully weak.  And what depresses me most of all is the large number of reviewers who seem to think this monstrosity is the best Bond film ever.  Come on people, this movie is the very definition of all style and no substance.  Fleming woudn't even recognize this character anymore.  I almost don't either.",1055116800,36,2265,4.5657568238213395
1452927,2,B00005JLBE,"I am a casual fan of the James Bond character, even though the franchise has seen a couple of real stinkers in its existence.  Many movies were good, a few were awful but this one is not among the best for sure.  Pierce Brosnan is a great James Bond and, in my opinion, the only rival to the Sean Connery legacy.  I loved Golden Eye and fairly liked Tomorrow Never Dies while I didn't care much for The World Is Not Enough.  But frankly, TWINE is much better than Die Another Day and I must say, I was bored by this movie for many reasons.
  First, even though I seem to be one of the few, I really like Madonna's title track and the opening credits were quite well-done.  But for me, the most disappointing thing is how the story sort of destroyed a big part of the character of James Bond.  The man is a cool, sophisticated, macho yet charming spy who uses his wit and physical abilities to fight the bad guys in a slightly over the top but reality-based way.
  The fact that Bond gets captured right at the beginning and spends the first 25 minutes of the movie in captivity, being tortured and degraded, really took the fun out of his whole persona in my humble opinion.  For me, the fact that Bond could never get captured before this was part of his legend.  I was bored really quickly with all the violence and skipped to the point where he finally gets to act like the 007 I recognized.  Well, I kept going for a while but couldn't bring myself to watch it all in real time and started to dissect the film in fast forward to avoid most of the action, even though I usually don't have anything against good stunts.
  Halle Berry as Jinx does a good job I guess but I just didn't click with her character and her performance seemed a bit forced and mechanical.  And she didn't have much chemistry with Bond.  Pierce Brosnan is good and he's not the problem here.  I know that they wanted to celebrate the franchise by ""winking"" at every other Bond movie throughout but this got old pretty quickly.  The invisible car was almost too much of a stretch to begin with but the final blow for me came when they started to use the slow-mo bullet time effect from the Matrix in a simulation scene.  I mean, what's the point?
  I agree with some of the reviewers who stated that the action was too overblown.  Much of it didn't really seem to serve the story (the sword fight for example had no purpose whatsoever) and went on for way too long.  There was very little suspense, just non-stop action which gets mind numbing after a while.  The ice palace was ludicrous if you ask me and none of the villains were remarkable.
  In conclusion, I gave it two stars because I know that with a film like this, it is definitely a question of taste.  Die Another Day is not necessarily a bad movie all the way as there are some good elements, mostly through Brosnan's performance who still injects some wit into his character once he's back to his old self.  But personally, I didn't like the film.  It was just boring to me even though I had no expectations and watched with an open mind.",1055030400,,3078,4.321116928446771
1453018,4,B00005JLBE,"Many devoted fans of the Bond series may not fully apppreciate this one.  It does take some risky departures from the standard Bond fare that we have come to know and love.  For instance, the pre-title sequence is a little longer, and rather than the suave Mr. Bond getting out without a scratch, he is imprisoned and tortured for 14 months in a North Korean hell hole, and emerges looking more like Charles Manson on a bad day.  The title song is not Bondish at all, as done my Madona, who only adds to the ambiance of the film.  She does a good job acting too.

Now Halle Berry is much hyped and does a good job in this film, however, even Bond has to come up with some bar room pick up lines to bed her in the early part of the film, not what we normally expect.  And of course, Holly's body is nice eye candy in a replica of the bathing suit worn by Ursula Andress that long 40 years ago to kick of the Bond series in Dr. No.

No, this is not the typical Bond film, but then this is a new century, and nothing stays the same forever, but the question is
will Bond lovers accept the change or tune out in favor of the good ole days.  The film is an entertaining one with plenty of action, and tongue in cheek humor, but may leave the viewer wandering ,""did I just watch a Bond film.""",1054944000,,1286,4.075396825396825
1453019,4,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was a good bond movie, not great, like Goldfinger or even Goldeneye, but still pretty good.  As others have stated, the first half of the movie is probably the best, taking the series into uncharted waters (ex: the torture scenes), but tending to fall back into familiar territory later in the movie.  It would have been nice to see Bond remain a rouge agent for the rest of the movie, having to work out his problems without the aid of M or Q.  This was done in License to Kill, though even then Bond did have a little help from Q.  The only real problem in the first half is the theme song by Madonna.  It was, quite frankly, terrible.  I hope this does not become the standard for which future Bond themes will follow.
  Most of the fight scenes were done well, the sword fight being a particular stand out.  While some have complained, I didn't have any problems with the Ice Palace or the orbiting solar reflector weapon.  Ice places do exist, though not quite like the one in the movie, but Bond is supposed to be larger then life, and the ice palace fits right in with other villains headquarters, such as bases in volcanoes, underwater structures, space stations, etc.  Also, there are currently designs for real solar reflecting mirrors which could be mounted on orbiting satellites to reflect light on to dark regions of the earth.  It is unlikely they could be used as a weapon as in the movie, but once again, Bond is supposed to be larger then life.  The villain's electric suit and Bond's car with its cloaking technology, on the other hand, were a bit too larger then life for me.  On the other hand, I thought it was nice to show Bond using the ejector seat to right the car after it had flipped over.  Usually, bond just happens to have a gadget given to him by Q which he just happens to find the perfect use for later.  In this case, it shows that Bond was improvising a gadget for something other then it was originally intended.
  Being that this was also the 20th official bond movie, many of the scenes in this movie are in someway paying tribute to previous Bond moves.  The scene in the Q lab showing many of the gadgets from previous movies (even the hollowed out alligator boat).  The new Q also pays tribute to Desmond's Q by saying ""Like my predecessor, I never joke about my work"".  This line was used in the movie Goldfinger.  Another reference is the bird watchers book Bond sees near the binoculars he borrows (Ian Flemming, the writer of the original Bond novels, got the name James Bond from a bird book he had, which was written by a man called James Bond).  The character of Jinx also appears dressed in a bikini which resembles the one worn by the character of Honey Rider from the first James Bond movie Dr. No.
  To sum it up, the first part of the movie was 5 stars (except for the theme song), and the second half wasn't quite as good but still was decent with a few minor problems.  I would hope though that they maybe try to tone down the sci-fi elements in the next one.  Once in a while is fine, but not for every single Bond movie.",1054944000,,3094,4.363636363636363
1453020,1,B00005JLBE,"One of the worst movies ever, and definitely the worst BOND movie ever, Die Another Day is like watching a boat sailing across the ocean....and slowly it starts sinking, and sinking, until the whole things just falls into the ocean and everyone in the boat dies. I felt like one of those people in the boat.
I couldn't believe how bad the acting was (Please, Madonna in a movie at ALL is bad enough), how silly the SPECIAL EFFECTS were....you would of thought that they would of least made an effort to make it seem realistic to maybe help soften the blow of such a silly plot and bad casting.
Halle Berry once again amazes me with her horrifying acting abilities. That's right, Halle, just keep walking down the beach in that skimpy bikini and everyone will call you great.

1453022,4,B00005JLBE,"Bond can be defined by each actor and era pretty easily: brutal and action packed (Connery); action orientated but with a humanized Bond (Lazenby); action and a bit of cheesy humor (early Moore); bad action, The Saint instead of Bond and lots of cheesy humor (late Moore); action and a hero with a conscience (Dalton). Now we come to the Brosnan era. The first Bond film featuring Brosnan was uncertain and tenative; it's clear that Brosnan had an idea as to how he wanted to play the role but hadn't been given a script where he could make the character his own.
With Die Another Day Brosnan is Bond every bit as much Connery was during his day. Die Another Day actually has something that had been missing from many of the Bond films until Brosnan took on the role--a complex plot and a character that isn't always pleased with the dirty deeds he has to do. Brosnan's Bond harks back to Connery's (and Dalton in his last screen appearence as Bond); Bond is brutal and merciless when he has to be. The last couple of Bond films have benefited from this return to form. While the previous three films all had their merits, the writing wasn't all it was cracked up to be on many of them.
Bond's mission in North Korea goes awry when an informant ID's him. He's captured, brutally tortured and left for dead. The British and Americans elect to do a prisoner exchange only because they believe he's become a security risk and is leaking valuable info to the North Korean government.
Bond loses his double 00 status. Suddenly, he's got a score to settle with or without MI6 helping him.
The stunts are spectacular as usual particularly the conclusion of the film. This is Bond for the 21st century and, I'm sorry, but it puts XXX to shame. The supporting cast featuring John Cleese as the new Q (he was introduced in the last Bond film) and Judi Dench as an unapproving Q are marvelous.
The DVD comes loaded with extras. There's an audio commentary from the director/producers and Pierce Brosnan. The second disc consists of a documentary, storyboard comparisons, multi-angle explosions from key scenes, a piece on the title design and visual effects. The only drawback is the inclusion of Madonna's weak title track and the accompanying video.",1054857600,,2240,4.673417721518987
1453023,4,B00005JLBE,"I actually rate this at four and a half stars. This is one heck of an anniversary. Some of the best action sequences in the history of Bond films really highlight this very enjoyable installment. One of the things I enjoyed was the obvious homage paid to the history of Bond, from the first sighting of the latest Bond girl, Jinx, coming in out of the surf ala Honey Rider in Dr. No, to various other little hints from Diamonds Are Forever, Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice. I won't ruin the fun of finding these little treats for you but they are liberally sprinkled about. Again, Brosnen does a great job as Bond, mixing a revived libido with revved up physical action and a certain grim demeanor that really carries the film. The villains are well designed and integrated into the plot in a logical manner. The photography is nothing short of gorgeous and the effects work is all pretty much first rate. The music, as usual, is an important component of any great Bond film. From the Madonna opener to the Clash's London Calling, the music has a grand sweep as well as a great sense of humor. The orchestral work is classic Bond, with muted horns layered in with sweeping strings to perfectly capture the John Barry feel. Old timey Bond fan or new devotee, this is a film sure to please all. Don't pass it up.",1054857600,,1314,4.479166666666667
1453024,4,B00005JLBE,"There was a longer-than-usual time between this and the previous Bond film (""The World Is Not Enough""), and it shows. The villain is better, the plot makes more sense, and there are no Denise Richards type non-actors around. ""Die"" gets off to a great start, and we see for the first time that not all Bond captors are perfect gentlemen who serve impeccable meals before trying to kill him off. There is also a spectacular sword fight and the de rigeur incredible stunts -- along with Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike in the eye candy department, except that they can really act. Brosnan, of course, is excellent as Bond, and John Cleese is the closest thing to the original ""Q"" we are likely to find. Technically, the picture looks great on DVD. The weakness, and it's important, comes in the extras department. Where previous Bond film DVDs came with sharp documentaries (and kept everything to one disk), this one has two DVDs. Disk 2 has some of the dreariest material you're likely to find. Unlike the film, it really DOES die.",1054857600,2,1028,4.685082872928176
1453025,1,B00005JLBE,"As a Bond fan who missed this at the theater, I anxiously awaited the DVD release. I shouldn't have. This film is terrible. Not only is it the worst Bond film ever (even out-distancing some of the atrocious Roger Moore films), it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, period.
There is simply no story here, at least not a coherent, interesting one. The villains fall flat, as do the good guys. And the dialogue is an embarrassment to screenwriters everywhere and to anyone not living in a vegetative coma.
Too much of the film is unexplainedly dedicated to the Cuban gene-therapy plastic surgery clinic (which might have been a good story: All the world's villains changing their identies genetically) when the real story is a madman with a killer satellite (hey, that's the story of Goldeneye! Been there, done that.)
It felt like huge bits (necessary transition bits) had been cut from the film as it jumped from one ubiquitous hokey action scene to another. I kept asking myself, ""Wait, where is he now? What is he doing? Did I miss something? What the hell is that huge key supposed to mean, and how did he know what lock it fit, and was that an abandoned subway under the London Bridge?""
Objects like the key, which are supposed to have great plot significance (to inform Bond that he has been disavowed by MI-6), don't have the hoped for impact if the audience is left to figure out the meaning for themselves.
And what's with the freaky old-time-batman-like zoom flashes during the chase scenes? Does anybody need that? NO!
If you must see Die Another Day, rent it on VHS. If we're lucky, your machine will eat it, preventing someone else from repeating your mistake.",1054857600,,1681,4.644295302013423
1453026,4,B00005JLBE,"OK, there's plenty of reviews of the film itself here, let's look at the DVD.  As with previous discs in the 007 Collection, MGM has offered up more bonus features than most casual viewers will ever need.  I was very excited to learn that, for the first time, Pierce Brosnan has recorded a commentary track.  While his comments tend to ramble and his delivery is, on the whole, a bit dry, it's nonetheless thrilling to have the man himself offering his observations on the film and the role of James Bond.  Somewhat more listenable are the comments by the director and producer.  And if that's not enough, there's a ""pop-up""-style track that conveys text info while you watch the movie.  My only minor complaint after sitting thru all 3 commentaries is that much information is repeated.
""Inside Die Another Day"", the main documentary, was also a bit of a letdown, as it focuses mainly on the technical aspects of production.  There are also short featurettes on gadgets, etc., as well as Madonna's delightfully sadistic music video and a making-of segment on the video.
If you're a 007 fan, there's no-doubt this is a must-have.  But even with 2 discs, I'd have to rate it slightly lower than the fully-loaded single disc presentations of other recent Bonds like Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies.",1054771200,4,1298,4.815315315315315
1453097,4,B00005JLBE,"I enjoyed this film but still long for the old days of Connery and Moore. It used to be that directors could create tension just by having Bond break into an office and try to grab evidence before the bad guys show up. Nowadays it takes half the North Korean army to give Bond a challenge. Ah, but times have changed and I can either endlessly grip about it or just accept it.
What I liked about the movie.
1. The opening surf scene
2. The ridiculous premise of a North Korean Colonel getting gene therapy to look like a British fop. It's silly but for whatever reason it worked for me.
3. The car scene with Bond and Zao. A little long but fun.
4. Hally Berry (much better than I expected)
5. The reaction of General Moon at seeing the transfomation of his son.
6. The fantastic special effects of Icarus.
7. Bond vs Mr. Kil in the laser room.
8. The sword fighting scene between Bond and Graves (best fight of the movie)
What I didn't like
1. Madonna's appearance in the film, Madonna's song, Madonna's name in the credits, Madonna being associated with this film...
2. The horrifically bad scene of Bond parasailing on a gigantic ice wave. Honestly, this was probably the most embarrasing special effect/stunt in the history of Bond movies. It was absolutely cartoonish.
3. Miranda Frost (didn't do it for me at all)
4. 'M' moving from bitchy into near psychosis. As a HUGE Bond fan I wonder if we're are supposed to think of the Brosnan Bond as being the same character as all previous Bond's. If so then he has rescued the world countless times in the past. For 'M' to discard him and to be so callous makes her seem like an emotionless monster. I mean he saved 'M's life just one film earlier.
5. The invisible car. C'mon. Let's get SERIOUS.
6. The endless puns and double entendre's. The writers really need to start showing some restraint in this area before Bond becomes walking joke maching.",1054771200,34,1901,4.4655172413793105

1453099,3,B00005JLBE,"This was, I believe, the twentieth Bond movie ever made. Starring Pierce Brosnan as Double - Oh, and Halle Berry as ""Jinx"" this movie was supposed to take James Bond to the next level. Well, it did, but probably not a very high level... When the movie started with an extended surfing scene (I kid you not, James Bond surfing), I started to worry a little bit about the movie. Actually, I ended up slightly surprised...it wasn't that bad!
The movie starts out with Bond being captured and tortured...and after Bond returns to MI6, his own government refuses to back him up (believing he leaked information to his captors). The movie is full of cool explosions, cool cars, cool fight scenes, and cool sets. In fact, I think the fencing match turned sword fight between Bond and Graves (played by Toby Stevens), is one of the best fighting sequences I've seen in a Bond movie.
Once again, John Cleese plays ""Q,"" providing several moments of non-stop hilarity while providing Bond with some cool new gadgets (and an invisible car). The movie was pretty good, but towards the end, the sexual innuendo was getting pretty extreme. The one-liners really weren't that funny, and most of the joking seemed far too contrived. Aside from that (and the poor blue-screening done during Bond's two surfing incidents), the movie was great and a lot of fun to watch.
This won't win as my favorite Bond movie (sorry, there wasn't any skiing!), but some of the new film techniques that were used certainly make this film stand apart from the rest.",1054684800,7,1529,4.7518796992481205
1453100,5,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" is the latest installment in the Bond series and, in essence, the plot is a rehash, ripped straight from the pages of ""Diamonds Are Forever"".  In a nutshell - a madman wants to dominate the world by using a satellite, fueled by diamonds, that is capable of blasting holes in the earth from outer space.  Rehash aside, the special effects in this movie are fantastic.  A few action sequences, including a thrilling sword fight chaperoned by Madonna, are also high points in this non-stop Bond bang up.
TRANSFER: MGM proves that they really do know how to master a DVD.  The anamorphic 2:35:1 picture is astounding in its color fidelity, clarity and background detail.  Even the darkest scenes exhibit remarkable detail and sharpness.  Edge enhancement and shimmering are present, but only in minute instances.  Pixelization doesn't present a problem.  The audio is 5.1 and really packs on the bass.  Dialogue is natural, though sometimes, frontal sounding.  Over all, though, nice balance.
Extras: OVER 7 HOURS WORTH - including Madonna's music video and a multitude of featurettes that document, not only the making of the film but the video game and music video spin offs from the film.  The fact that all the extras are put on a separate disc is a really nice touch that one wishes MGM had done on the rest of its Bond titles.

Die Another Day had a very good plot with great acting. However, over the years, Bond girls have been getting too ""sexy"". I feel that this takes away from the film. Over all, this film was action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat. The car chase was very well done but the surf boarding was very poor. You could tell that it was done on a computer. Q could have done a better job! More over, I gave this film 4 stars. Well put together except for the surfboard shots. Trully a must have for the collector and Bond lover.

1453102,1,B00005JLBE,"Well, I honestly thought Brosnan would bring in a new swing to the bond franchise. Goldeneye was witty, action-packed, well scripted and actually quite dark too, but in a good way! However, things have totally gone to pot here. We have villains with david bowie make-up and glowing masks, enough digital mockery to shake a stick at, (then make it spin round in slo-mo then zoom towards the camera), and just generally ludicrous ideas - invisible cars for goodness-sake! Who on earth on the bond team thought, ""YEH! and his car can, like, totally disappear"". This film is like a computer game, when I saw Brosnan surfing a 10,004 foot wave I had to check my hands to see if I was holding an x-box control pad! ...",1054252800,10,712,4.5703125

The 20th installment in the MGM series is truly awesome. James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) tries to save the world from a super North Korean villain (Rick Yune) who wants to use lasers to bring destruction. Jinx (Halle Berry) is the best Bond girl ever (tied with Famke Janssen's Xenia Onatopp, yes!) and she kicks more booty than Foxy Brown and Foxy Cleopatra combined. The beach scene is pure hotness! Who cares about the other girl, she's bad. I saw that part coming galaxies ago. Even Madonna is worthy of being called an ""actress"" now. Yes!

James Bond has swept many women off of their feet, but not too often has he been swept off of his. This is the theme of the 20th installment of James Bond. This isn't your dad's (or even grandfather's) old Bond. James has moved with the times and he's on top of his game in this excellant flick. The movie plays like a rollercoaster with enough F/X to keep your mouth hanging open for well over two hours. With such memorable scenes as the stunning opening sequence, the car chase on ice and the fight with Jinx and the blonde lady in a crashing helicopter, be prepared to anticipate a 21st installment.",1053993600,2,788,4.36734693877551
1453205,2,B00005JLBE,"It's surprising to me how polarized the reaction has been to this movie.  For every person who loves it, there's another like me, who believes it's true that ""Die Another Day"" is quite a disappointing low point for the Bond series.  While it easily represents Pierce Brosnan's best performance in the role, it is also a story that is full of needlessly extraneous complexities and gimmicks that are outrageous even for a 007 movie (the ice mansion takes the cake, for sure).  But one of the most alarming trends in these movies of late (for me, anyway) has been the casting of the supporting roles; namely, the Bond Women.  Over the past few movies, we've seen actresses such as Teri Hatcher, Denise Richards (ouch!!), and now Halle Berry taking greatly taking away from the exotic elements that have always made Bond's women so appealing, mysterious, and sexy, and providing us instead with run-of-the-mill American characters who diminish greatly from James Bond's starring role.  Now, he shares these movies with other actors... he co-stars in them.  And that's just not the way it's supposed to be.  I appreciate the mentality of trying to keep things fresh, especially after 40 years' worth of movies, but since Cubby Broccoli died, the Bond franchise has taken a very noticeable turn toward the ordinary, and with every movie that gets made, I find myself hoping that this trend will reverse itself.  It hasn't.  But--to add insult to injury--the most alarming trend of all makes its most significant mark in ""Die Another Day"": Blue-screened and digital effects and stunts.  FAKE STUNTS!  One of the great trademarks of the Bond movies used to be the way that stuntmen were required to continually push the envelope in spectacularly death-defying ways that no other sane filmmakers could even dream of.  I would go so far as to say that this was the heart and soul of the Bond movies, until Broccoli died.  Now we have actors in front of obviously fake blue screens, and digital exploding airplanes on the agonizing caliber of the laughable plane crash in ""Air Force One.""  This is intolerable, and I TRULY hope that the next Bond movie will 1) invest a little more money and effort in executing these things properly, and 2) hiring a director OTHER than Lee Tamahori who understands the proper execution of action scenes by making them sleek and stylized (in true 007 fashion), not gritty and unfocused with completely random, ""Matrix""-like slow-downs.  In the end, I give this movie 2 stars because it does have some very entertaining moments, but ""Die Another Day"" is ultimately unsatisfying because it amounts to far less than the sum of its parts.  Personally, I expected more from the 20th Bond film.  Better luck next time, 007.",1053907200,6,2741,4.885529157667387
1453206,2,B00005JLBE,"I am a major James Bond fan.  I like to give all the movies a fair chance...but this one...awful.  It had a wonderful premise to start with...JB gets captured and then released but nobody trusts him blah blah.  Then, he escapes and you think ""hey he is going to use all his covert and independent connections to catch this guy without the help of the British govt.  He is going to single-handedly nail this terrorist.""  Something like that...then BOOM.  Nope, M calls him in and stupid plot ensues.  Halle Berry does not help.  It seems these days that Bond women have such a bad reputation for being vapid and stupid (they are not...watch the old movies and some actually have character) that ANY hint of attitude immediately seems to label them as ""a breath of fresh air.""  Zao...a wasted character.  They tell us nothing about him but he and JB are enemies somehow...and then he does nothing cool.  And he dies like a Long Island teenager in an IROC on a snowy day.  I have to admit...the motivation of the main villain was ALMOST practical, but then you always wonder in these cases, when you have a multi-trillionaire villain, why don't they rely more on their money to manipulate things?  Here is the problem - Living Daylights and License to Kill had two of the best plots so far...(cloak and dagger, and rogue agent) but not too many people liked the actor.  I won't touch that right now.  So then Goldeneye comes out...and because of the long time between movies, the new actor, the very very different music, the emotional look in to JB's motivation for his job....it took too many people too long to agree.  Goldeneye is an AMAZING JB movie, and one of the best if not the best (watch the fight scene between 007 and 006 at the end).  However, the reviews were mixed...because people were not sure what they wanted.  So, obviously, producers and directors said ""they want the old JB formula!""  News flash...there IS no JB formula.  Gadgets!?!  Gadgets!?  THAT is what people want?  Come ON, we just had a movie with Gadget in the title that sucked.  Anyhoo, the JB franchise needs a brave soul to give us a PLOT that makes sense.  Give us a villain with motivation.  Who even cares if JB has a girlfriend?  Take a chance and leave it out.  Pierce Brosnan, it should be pointed out, has the ability to play JB very very well, and can run with anything thrown to him.  So please, throw him something good, or don't try to ""make another movie.""  This series is laughing at itself.",1053475200,7,2488,4.55079006772009

Halle Berry deserved every mintue in being in this film. She won a VERY important award at the time and i think that being in a bond film was left from her doing. I have been a bond fan ever since the game for Nintendo 64 came out which was Goldeneye i play it and loved it and then i heard it was a movie. I saw the movie and was such a fan of the movie then i stared becoming a fan from then on. I love all the James Bond Movies and feel that each actor that play james Bond did justice to the movies and play the roles they were suppose to play. Die Another Day brings so much action in this latest flick it leaves you brealthless. Also i love the dancing, electric water girls that start off in the beaging. I think that makes the opening of every james bond movie to get up and dance also. Die Another Day is a great movie everyone should get it on DVD/VHS.",1053475200,3,1030,3.956730769230769

1453212,2,B00005JLBE,"Need proof that the Bond series has reached its nadir? Look no further than the convoluted ""Die Another Day"". With director Lee Tomahori at the helm, the 20th film in the legendary spy canon suffers an overreliance of special effects and a dire shortage of plot, grace and style. While Bond films once dictated the stylistic direction of the action genre, they now merely mimick well-worn formulas guaranteed to spike box office returns. In other words, the generic ""Die Another Day"" is indistinquishable from the likes of ""XXX"" or ""Mission Impossible II"".
Over-burdened with explosive action and endless carnage, the film never slows down to allow the audience to pause or to absorb anything remotely resembling suspense or plot development. The persistent assault of action simply masks gaping holes in script, logic and characterizaton. Sadly, Pierce Brosnan's Bond is reduced to that of push button spy. Whereas Sean Connery would have muscled his way out of trouble, and Roger Moore may have utilised his cunning sense of humor, Brosnan relies heavily on gimmicky gadgets such as invisible cars to escape danger.
The comic talents of John Clease, replacing the late Desmond Llewelyn in the role of Q, are wasted on what seems to be a mere caricature. Much heralded Halle Berry is perfunctory in her requisite turn as Bond girl. Decked in a 1960's-era bikini --an obvious tribute to original Bond girl Ursula Andress-- the talented Berry is nothing more than eye candy in a film full of visual gimmicks. Unlike Andress' Honey Rider, whose complexity is revealed as ""Dr. No"" unfolds, Berry's Jinx is never allowed to develop.
The saving grace of ""Die Another Day"" lies in its subtle tribute to the James Bond of yesteryear. Celebrating the franchise's 40th Anniversary, numerous references to Bond's glorious past pop-up throughout the film. Older fans will undoubtedly appreciate the cameo of ""Thunderball's"" jet pack, or the glistening satelite a la ""Diamonds Are Forever"". However, such nostalgic nods prove to be painful reminders of just how far this once great film franchise has fallen. Gone is the perfect blend of action, humor and romance which doted revered classics ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia With Love"". In its place is formulaic simplicity. The time for James Bond to permanently hang up his Walther PPK is growing near.",1050105600,7,2340,5.1122715404699735

1453214,2,B00005JLBE,"Die-hard Bond fans like myself, the people who grew up with Bond and have watched every other movie countless times, won't find much to like in this one.  Instead of following the legacy that has built up over the past 40 years, the producers are now pandering to the legions of 14-year-olds that they obviously think are the only audience for this film.  The movie is packed with ridiculous science fiction weaponry, unrealistic computer-generated effects, and the typical over-the-top action antics of such recent films as The Matrix and Mission Impossible.  Instead of continuing to be trend-setters, the Bond producers are now simply trying to copy every other popular film in order to draw in the teenage action-film crowds.  Will they make money from it?  Of course.  Will the Bond film series suffer as a result?  Without a doubt.  I can only hope that Die Another Day ends up being a modern-day Moonraker, with the producers realizing afterwards that they need to go back to their roots in order to make a quality film.",1049328000,8,1027,4.862068965517241
1453305,4,B00005JLBE,"I like this movie.  The first half is likea Sean Connery-type James Bond film where the last half is more like the type of Bond film Roger Moore was in, but Pierce Brosnan makes it his Bond in this movie.  Although Pierce seems a little forced in his emotions at times as James Bond in this movie and the last Bond entry, The World Is Not Enough.  Halle Berry is OK as Jinx, but I have seen better performances from former Bond girls.  This is a better James Bond movie than The World Is Not Enough.
The movie opens with James Bond going into North Korea to assassinate someone in the North Korean military, and he almost gets away with it.  He tries to escape and gets chased only to be captured and tortured for over a year in a North Korean prison.  He only gets set free because of a prisoner exchange.  They get Bond out because they fear he has talked and betrayed Queen and Country.  They put him through tests and to see if someone planted a weapon in him since it is the times after the horrible incidents on September 11, 2001.  They hold Bond on a military ship near Hong Kong, but James Bond escapes because he wants to know who betrayed him and that someone is working for MI-6.  He goes to Cuba under false papers and ends up at a place where people can have their faces changed with radical new methods, and while in Cuba James Bond meets a CIA agent Jinx (Halle Berry).  Bond goes back to England after he discovers a rich Englishman is involved.  The rich guy is involved in some new solar project that can create sunlight anywhere anytime in the world.  Bond gets invited to see it tested in Iceland, and Bond gets accepted back in the fold by M to find out where everything fits in.
I don't know if I want to buy this DVD.  It does look like it has a full package of extras, but I wonder when will they release the deleted scenes from this movie.  I know there are deleted scenes because I have seen the production stills of some deleted scenes.  Did MGM pull the deleted scenes from this 2 DVD release because tehy wanted to release a new edition of DAD to coincide with the next Bond movie that looks likely to come out at the end of 2004.  That [is bad].  Why should we buy a 2 DVD package now only to find out later they will release a new edition of the DVD set with more extras like the deleted scenes that were originally rumored to be on this first release of the Die Another Day DVD?  It's just not fair and it is simply flogging more money from the consumer.  Maybe I would be a more inclined to buy the DVD if they could replace the god-awful theme song that is sung by Madonna.",1049155200,4,2608,4.198795180722891
1453306,3,B00005JLBE,"For people who like action movies this is definitely for them. For BOND fans on the other hand, this is just a decent one to add to their collection. I think Brosnan is finished after he does his 5th one because Goldeneye was truly his best Bond movie (and one of the best in the series) and none after that have been nearly as good. They seem to have gotten less intriguing for Bond fans each time he comes out with another but Tomorrow Never Dies was great, then TWINE and of course DAD were just half as good. Hopefully Brosnan's next (and final) one will be at least as good as Tomorrow Never Dies.",1049068800,2,602,4.243478260869566
1453307,2,B00005JLBE,"I was really looking forward to this film. I like action movies, and the gadgets, and movies with HALLE Barry.
Sadly this Bond movie was just awful. - Poor development of character, despite an unusual start to the film - Far too much reliance on special effects - many of which were not even remotely likely. - Awful sound track, and probably the worst opening Bond theme tune ever. - And what happened to the use of the James Bond music.... you know, the guitar riff. Usually James gets to say ""Bond, James Bond"" at least once in the movie, and the little tune goes ""dum diddy um dumm"". Where's it gone? The whole thing was totally uninvolving.
The villain was ok. And the lesser villain (with the diamond face) was actually the more interesting of the two, but he never really got going. The sword fight was pretty good. The rediculous scene with the rocket-powered ice skating vehicle... what was that all about?? One minute he's doing 400mph and the ray's right up his tail pipe. Next minute he's stopped, and the ray's miles behind him. Errr.. surely if you slow down, it catches you? .....
Bond's supposed to be about wit, sophistication and daring. He's supposed to be the man every man wants to be, and every woman wants. OK, perhaps that's not PC any more, but it's what a Bond film is, and I for one would love to see something that is not PC for a change. ... an non-PC film. Now there's an idea.
So all I saw here was a bunch of gadgets, some product placement (although not as bad as earlier movies... Bond in a family saloon, for heaven's sake) and bad digital effects. The only positive thing was brief ""cameos"" by Judi Dench, John Cleese and Madonna. ...P>Final verdict? Go see it if you've nothing else to do, but really there are a lot of better films out there.
(All my opinion, of course!)",1049068800,20,1809,4.451807228915663
1453308,2,B00005JLBE,"I am not particularly a fan of Pierce Brosnan, but I admit he is in a sense an underestimated actor.  He can play a villain, and did in the past more than once, and was quite good.  So, there is nothing surprising if he succeeds as James Bond, world's most celebrated spy, and he showed it in ""Golden Eye"" (which I consider the best of his Bond films) which deservedly revived the once nearly dead franchise of 007.
But I regret to say that ""Die Another Day"" failed to live up to my expectations.  The story is just OK; I heard complaints about the way the too incredible situations about DNA, but I do not care.  And the film clearly should have stayed out of on-going political matters, and I understand the anger of Korean people, North and South alike, but after all, this is entertainment, where anything can be possible.  No, my complaint is due to something else.
The opening is just great; James Bond doing his mission in North Korea.  It includes a highly thrilling actions about hovercrafts, and tongue-in-cheek moments that make Bond films quite funny to see.  But then, something goes wrong after that.  The usually imaginative opening credit section is one example.  You see guns (I say good), women (I say ok), and ... tortured spy!?  And next you see half-naked and bearded, not-so-clean James Bond walking around in hotel lobey.  Here I sensed misguided ideas of director Lee Tamahori, whose Hollywood films failed to match the promised talent he showed once.
But there are more to say, and let's be frank.  The globe-trotting story is weak, and I think it is time for the series to provide a stronger, more impressive villain like in the days of Blofeld (and his white cat).  Halle Berry's Jinx always steals the show; we get unexpected support from Michael Madsen and Colin Salmon (who was good in ""Resident Evil"" as an unlucky commander).  As to other actors, they are all good if not particularly great, owing to short screen time.  And when I say good, that also goes to Madonna who, however, is given a very corny line to say.
We get fairly good ingredints.  However, the most lamentable part of the film is its overuse of CGIs.  We welcome overblown actions, the seires' trademark.  I love ""Golden Eye"" for its extravagant action sequences like a tank running in the street, but they are great because the stunts did really did it.  But now, we see a flying plane over icefield which looks obviously made from CGI technique, and to make matters worse, these CGIs are below average.
We again see many gadgets (and John Cleese who take over the role of Q); we see many good actors.  But we don't see the good use of them, for which the director is responsible.",1048636800,3,2681,4.604210526315789
1453309,3,B00005JLBE,"Many scenes were too loud even for a home theater fan.  Or maybe make that 'the scenes were loud enough for the home theater fan' but that would be insulting to home theater fans. Yes, I found most of the soundtrack too loud.  And I mean, if we intend to enjoy movies for many more years, we ought to save our ears.
And the characters were just over the top superhuman.  There was this car chase in the snow where the Korean bad guy actually fires a Gatling-type gun directly over his head while chasing Bond!  Was he wearing ear protection?  With weapons of such caliber, even ear muffs over ear plugs won't protect him.  And yet he remains unaffected by all the noise.  I can totally suspend disbelief for a fantasy movie(LOTR), but only so far for other movie genres.
I found the new Bond by Brosnan rougher, edgier than his first three, which is a relief for me.  Keeps him real and honest.  Of course, long time fans might disagree.  I also happen to like On Her Majesty's Secret Service much, so it follows, I guess.

1453312,2,B00005JLBE,"I've been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember.  The first movie I took a date to was 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only"".  DAD is hardly that flick.  To begin, Lee Tamahori directs this piece like it was some MTV video.  With screaming zooms across glacier plains and cuts from the beginning of the car chase to somewhere in the middle, I felt like he assumed my attention span was zero and had to do something to regain it.  Some of us like suspense, intrigue, and drama in our Bond flicks.  One gets the feeling had he directed Goldfinger, the wonderful flight to Goldfinger's ranch in Kentucky would have been cut completely.
Add to this that Lee T is a John Woo wannabe (slow mo' and show it from 20 different angles!).  This movie was what I expected XXX to be and yet XXX felt more like a Bond film, even if Vin Diesel's Xavier (""X"") isn't quite the suave and debonaire persona you'd expect from Bond.  At least the movie didn't assault the senses with extreme cuts and fast-forward zooms and truly unbelievable effects (like a plane could GET that torn up and still remain airborne).
The only truly good parts of DAD were the scenes with John Cleese (the new ""Q""), the investigative work and fight in Cuba (actually felt like a Bond flick), Bond's stay in Hong Kong (especially his entrance to the hotel), and the training simulation where he and ""Tanner"" sweep MI6 HQ to eliminate a clear and present threat to the organization.  In other words, half an hour is about the sum of the good in DAD.",1048032000,2,1500,4.405797101449275
1453373,5,B00005JLBE,"After the disappointing THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Bond No. 20 is the first to match the excellent GOLDENEYE in terms of action and acting. Pierce Brosnan shows another side to James Bond while remaining true to the character. And Halle Berry as the sultry Jinx is indeed an equal to 007, no wonder she's getting a spin-off film. Starting off with a fast-paced and very LOUD pre-credits action sequence, the film's plus points are more evident in the action than plot. But hey, it's Bond, not Shakespeare, and director Lee Tamahori has ensured that modern action film movie-goers will not be disappointed, for there is much to be enjoyed in terms of ear-splitting action. There is something to be said about the over-use of frenetic action explosions that obscures David Arnold's classy score. But said action moves the film forward with a quick pace and hardly any stalls. Highlights include some inventive laser-dodging, Bond sword-fighting, Bond hanglide-surfing and the fantastic car chase between 007 and villain Zao, though giving the bad guy's car missiles lessens the originality of Bond's ""cool car"" feature. Regardless, it's an incredible action seqeunce and the big audience payoff.
The previous 007 adventure, Michael Apted's ham-fisted TWINE had action but no momentum. This one does away with over-plotting and nonsensical motives for villains taking over the world. The villains, especially Gustav Graves are well-written and get into the fist-fights rather than the laconic Bond villains of late. As sad as it is to not have Desmond Llewelyn to do the old ""Oh grow up, 007"", John Cleese actually does a good job of stepping into Q's shoes. And Samantha Bond and Judi Dench as Monneypenny and M respectively do a good job. The main problem that the Bond films have had over the years is the string of shaky B-movie directors. Tamahori bumps the trend and infuses the spectacular action with enough witty one-liners and quips so as not to stray too far from the sure-fire formula. Though some scenes have been ""Matrix-ised"", it's still cool, as is Bond's gadget-laden Aston Martin with the unique feature off disappearing courtesy of tiny hidden cameras fixed to the car's exterior reflecting the opposite sides. Sound far-fetched? Well, it is, but it's still really cool. Just like the film itself. Watch it, and have a Bond-sized blast.",1047513600,17,2350,5.043701799485861

Then they go after the villain at an ice hotel, no really, it does exist, the whole place is made out of ice, and she gets imprisoned in a room.  Thats where the movie fell apart for me.  She can't get out of the room.  She's the American equivalent of James Bond and she can't get out of an ice room?  Thats when the movie really becomes bad.
You can't have someone built as an equal and then have her become the damsel in distress.  Madonna's appearance is fun but she's not given a lot to work with, though the name Verity is cool.
So in the end this film, while slick, with lots of special effects, sags because James Bond is so perfect and everyone else is fallible.",1047340800,2,936,4.104395604395604

It has the Martinis, the fights, the cars and the gadgets! It is a very interesting movie and you will love to see it over and over again when it is released in DVD. Especially the intro, Evaluation Center escape, Cuba espionage, Sword Fight, Q-Lab Scene, Aston Martin in Iceland, Midnight espionage, Laser Fight, Icarus Escape, Car Chase, The Antonov Airplane scene and another one I won't mention ;) which was very funny. You should add it to your Bond collection! This one will be the best you can own! ... There are lots of kind of Bond movies...

1453376,4,B00005JLBE,"I am a HUGE Bond fan-own all the movies on dvd; own all the books (except ""Colonel Sun"" and the Gardner books). Connery's the best, but Brosnan seems to be getting better and better with each film, culminating in ""Die Another Day"", his best performance,and the best Bond since ""For Your Eyes Only"".
The first half of this flick is VERY Fleming-Bond being tortured (as he was in many of the books), then investigating with good old fashioned detective work.
The second half is very BIG and escapist-but it works. The movie has many nods towards previous Bond movies-from Halle coming out of the water in Ursula's bikini, to the plot-a diamond-encrusted laser, and many more. The thing I loved about DAD is it was totally over-the-top, but treated itself very seriously. The scenes were directed with punch. It was the opposite of say, ""Spy Who Loved Me"", which was fantastic, but didn't take itself seriously. Halle Berry was great (although hardly the first ever ""Equal"" Bond girl-from Pussy Galore to Michelle Yeou's character in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", there have been more than a few women who were more than mere set-decoration).
Does the story bog down at the end? Yes. Do some of the CG effects look bad? Yes. Is DAD in the same league as ""Goldfinger"", ""OHMSS"" or ""From Russia With Love""? No. BUT, it is the best in ages, and blows away ANY of the 70's films, in my opinion (not that that's hard to do).
I must admit that, as great as Judi Dench is, M will always be Bernard Lee for me-he was a surrogate father to Bond, and I don't think it's as effective, or true to the books, having a woman play M. BUT, it does, of course, wink at 007's sexism. There will never be another Q like Desmond, but let's face it-the last few movies saw him as way too old to be still working. Cleese does a good job of UNDER-playing Q, and therefore making him believable AND funny. And although Lois Maxwell will always be the definitive Moneypenny, Samantha Bond a) has a fab last name, and b) gets dirty in this movie. Gotta' love it. Bring back Felix and I'll be happy.
See it-it ROCKS!!!! Re-vitalizes Bond, and seems more current, hip, and edgy than the last few adventures. Lee Tamahori and the writers should be commended (and indeed, Brosnan has stated that he wants them back for the next film-his last). Good job, EON!!!",1047081600,10,2319,4.563549160671463

1453380,3,B00005JLBE,"I've been a James Bond fan for a long time. Before President Kennedy made Ian Fleming's books popular, I had read every book and was pleased with the early Bond movies. Like most older Bond fans, I have particular favorites; 'From Russia With Love', 'Goldfinger', 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', and some were definite bombs such as 'A View to Kill'. 'Die Another Day' is not amoung the best nor the worst. I like Brosnan as the first truely believable James Bond since Connery but the director seems to think that the only way you can sell an action movie these days is to appeal to the MTV set.
One of the real pleasures of the Bond series is that you know that the physical stunts are expertly staged with mechanical & physical stunt work. The camera lingers over every scene in early Bond movies which makes the more cinema literate viewer appreciate the staging done to pull off the stunts. Early Bond films used few, if any, visual camera tricks other them the standard blue screen. Such is not the case with 'Die Another Day'.
The use of digital and computer generated effects is far to obvious in this film and detracts from the overall effect for older viewers like myself. Early Bonds were smart and fit but not super human. Their actions were believable. For example, Brosnan's first film 'GoldenEye' had a now classic 'tank through the streets' sequence. It is a perfect example of the use of mechanical-physical stunt work built around the use of camera forced perspective. Compare this with the 'cars on the ice lake' chase. The computerized graphics are unreal and the physical forces displayed are unrealistic. Maybe for a cartoon, but not for a live-action movie.
I hope that this trend in filmmaking will not continue. Being blasted out of my theater seat with overloud sound, 1/2 to 1 second film edits, and digital enhancements, is not my idea of a good time at the movies.
If you think I am wrong about this, wait for the DVD and watch the film at home on a TV. Decide for yourself how well this film holds up to repeat viewing. BTW, I do intend the buy the DVD when it is released in June, 2003. I am, after all, a James Bond fan.",1046390400,2,2155,4.5424164524421595
1453381,2,B00005JLBE,"This Bond thriller is packed with cliches and poor character development.  It contains the worst dialogue of all the Pierce Brosnan Bond films_ not just from Bond, but just about every character's lips_ especially Halle Berry's.  The intro of the film is surreal and lacks the usual touch of class_ due to a poor title song and some awful nude lady collage. It's basically the same Bond script, like all the others ie_ good girl, bad girl; he has a vodka martini; he gets the cool spy gadgets; he goes around telling everyone his surname first; plenty of things blow up; there's some sick puppy (who must die) who has a devious masterplan; Bond gets laid by the good and bad girl; he's falling out of a plane...you know, all the usual stuff, and yes, he's in bed again by the end of the movie. It's like dog food formula, at this point, and in need of some fresh ideas.  You never feel as if his life is really in danger, as he crusades through his most superficial and materialistic adventure.  What is Madonna doing in the film_ her part was a pointless detour, but somewhat fitting in the overall flatness of this flick.
  A lot of work went into making this film visually exciting, but some basic things are missing from the getgo_  especially good writing. If you want to laugh, check it out because, in my opinion, it's so absurd it really should have been a comedy.",1046131200,6,1372,4.485943775100401
1453382,4,B00005JLBE,"Been a bond fan before JFK.  Disappointed in DAD from a Bond perspective, but an entertaining movie from Michael, Barbara and team.  I shuddered when I heard that Madonna was to do the theme song, and I was correct.  It was disastrous.  I can sing the theme songs for all of the movies (Dr. No didn't have one). DAD was just a repititious ramble of ""Die Another Day"".  Didn't particularly care for Ms. Berry. Bond movies are taken a little more serious with me. Bond movies should not be done with what's popular at that time.  Lots of good actors around, e.g., Sean Connery as ""M"", since he probably would not do it, how about Roger Moore.  George Lazenby might even be interested.  Cleese is ok as ""Q"", but not as clever as DL.  Here's hoping the next Bond is worth remembering.",1045958400,,780,4.436619718309859
1453467,4,B00005JLBE,"I'm not an avid 'Bond' fan. I havn't seen all the films, and frankly don't care to; I watch movies for entertainment, escapism and enjoyment. And I have to say, I got it right here.
Although the film breaks no moulds, it has everything an action flick movie go-er could wish for; a dashing hero, a naughty villian, sex (in true Bond style), action (lots of it), betrayal, suspense etc, the list is endless. A Bond movie that keeps the secret agent-genre alive without kicking the 'living daylights' out of it (can't believe I said that). The action is fantastic, cartwheeling us from scene to scene following a plot obviously designed to get the most ass-kicking as is possible from a feature length movie. James' one liners are delivered as cornily (?) as possible (they ARE supposed to be you know) and it even manages to take a giggle at itself with some clever references to past exploits. Special effects are as overdone as the stunts, as is it's ilk, and are very well executed (most of the time). 'Normal' Bond buffs will love it I think, from the diamond encrusted visage of a nasty henchman, to the massive laser generator orbiting the Earth to be used for no good (A la Goldeneye) to the grand Ice Palace of James' nemesis Mr Graves. I thought the whole thing was great fun to watch, and took me right back to when I could watch a film and come away wishing I was as dashing and heroic as the protagonist. My advice...go and watch it, you'll be glad you did. Fantastic. **** (5 stars would have to be a truly exceptional film.)",1045612800,6,1537,4.492857142857143
1453468,5,B00005JLBE,"The greatest Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Brosnan is brilliant and has become a very credible 007. To me he is the second greatest Bond - my favorite still remains Timothy Dalton. The film's action scenes are probably the greatest in Bond history while the first half of the film is very Fleming like. The first half could be a Fleming novel - it is that good. The teamwork of Brosnan and Berry is brilliant. She is the greatest Bond lady since Michelle Yeoh and among the greatest Bond girls ever. Pike is excellent although it is maybe too obvious she is a villain. I'm from Iceland and it is brilliant to watch Bond in action in my home country. Seeing him drive the all famous Aston Martin in Iceland gave me the chill. But the greatest aspects of the film is all the known items from previous films that appear throughout the film. From the novel Bond picks up in Havana (written by a James Bond) and Brosnan's ""stealing"" and eating a grape (a la Thunderball) to the emergence of Jinx from the ocean (Dr. No) and all the old equipment in Q branch. Brilliant stuff that will keep the hardcore Bond fans happy.
Die Another Day is a fantastic Bond adventure that should please both hardcore Fleming fans and the average action film fan. A must for all Bond fans.",1045526400,11,1284,4.468085106382978

When it comes to action movies, this is top-notch, but us Bond-aficionados have come to expect the best.  The best, however, was not delivered this time.
Die Another Day will forever be similar to Diamonds Are Forever- a few great moments, but ultimately forgettable.",1045353600,,422,4.767123287671233
1453470,3,B00005JLBE,"The long-awaited 20th Bond film has finally come out, and after seeing it, my enthusiasm as a big Bond fan has dwindled. For the history of Bond, ""Moonraker"" has held its place as the most far out and craziest of the Bond films. But now Die Another Day has shoved Moonraker aside and taken its place. Bond movies are supposed to be big and action-packed, but how far can you go?.....
The plot of Die Another Day revolves around Bond being sent to a prison camp after wreaking havoc in a de-militarized zone in Korea, north of the 38th parallel. While the teaser depicting Bond surfing to his destination is quite exciting, the movie slowly falls apart there. After 9 months in a prison camp, Bond is ""abandoned"" by MI-6 and turns into a ""rogue"" agent. If this sounds anything like Licence To Kill, the ""nostalgia"" feeling doesn't quite end here. Bond eventually ends up in Cuba where he hears of a clinic that changes the faces of people. Along the way he meets up with Jinx. Jinx (Halle Berry) is probably one of the worst female Bond roles to date. She is crude ""Yo mama! .... He DID you?!"" and was so hopelessly stupid that she had to be introduced Honey Ryder style, emerging from the water in a Honey Ryder bathing suit. And they thought they could fool us by having the bathing suit be orange...... And so the story goes from there. Bond jumps around from one dangerous encounter to the next, soon finding out that Gustav Graves is Colonel Moon, the man Bond supposedly killed in Korea. And his plan is to use a laser satellite (Goldeneye or Diamonds Are Forever anyone?) to destroy whatever he wants to destroy. Suddenly Bond is at an ice palace, getting himself into more action situations. There is a car chase scene where Bond and the badguy should just stand there, selling the the cars to the audience rather than having us cringe at the terrible CG effects. Then the story moves on into the ice palace melting, and Bond and Jinx escape, only to end up on Graves' airplane, where a fight ensues. During this fight we are shown ten minutes worth of bad CG effects and are revealed everything that may have been confusing to us.
Throughout the movie, three things are apparent: the quips are not placed subtly, the CG effects are terrible, and the camerawork/music/action sequences are obviously trying to appeal to pop culture. Madonna's title song is terrible as is her cameo. The 80's and early 90's are over, so I think it is time she takes a step back off the stage before she ruins another Bond movie. The same goes for Halle Berry. She may have won an Academy Award, but not all acting roles are the same, so she wasn't necessarily a fool-proof choice. And I think it's time Bond girls get toned down a little. Equality between the sexes may be necessary in the real world, but James Bond is a fantasy world so quit trying to make everything politically correct.
The character of Gustav Graves is another weak point in the film. The most apparent is when he is fencing Bond at Blades. Gustav Graves totally tears the card club apart, yet no police officers or security officers ever arrive. Just because he is rich doesn't mean he can destroy anything he likes. And his over-the-topness was a bit over-done. Skydiving into the spotlight of media cameras? Building an impractical ice palace? Destroying a card club in London? It is amazing that he didn't fall under suspicion a lot sooner.
The problems with this movie are so numerous that not even the 1,000 word limit offered by Amazon.com would be enough to say everything. Die Another Day appears to be the turning point in the Bond series. I will give the Bond movies one more chance to redeem themselves. But if the next Bond movie is bad, I will very sadly have to say, ""You just killed James Bond.""",1045353600,3,3772,4.556701030927835

I've come to expect a certain level of well...fantasy involved. It was certainly a long movie. Brosnan and Berry's performances were not wooden though I got a little annoyed by the sexual inuendo throughout the dialog. I mean it got down right cheesy at times. I thought the action scenes were decent if not at time over the top (i.e. Bond windsuffering on an enormous artic wave). Hey this is James Bond, I wasn't aware that he was superhuman, oh yeah he does regenerate every decade or so just like Doctor Who.",1045267200,,638,4.654867256637168
1453472,4,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was an excellent Bond film.  It had all the gadgets, a great story, lots of action, and a new Q (John Cleese) who, although he can never replace the late Desmond Llewelyn, is a very worthy successor to the title because of his wisecracking sense of humor and ability to give as good as he gets from Bond (Pierce Brosnan).  Dame Judi Dench returns as M, Bond's boss, and Samantha Bond is back as the ever efficient Moneypenny, along with Colin Salmon as Robinson.  Halle Berry turns in a wonderful performance as Jinx, Bond's American counterpart, and Toby Stephens is awesome as Gustav Graves, Bond's latest enemy.
My biggest complaint about Die Another Day is the theme song performed by Madonna (who also had a small role in the film).  I came in expecting another title song in the grand tradition of Bond themes, complete with horns, guitar, and whatnot, and what do I get?  A piece of dreck that would not be out of place in Saturday Night Fever.  Don't get me wrong; I like Madonna, but a piece of techno-pop like the song she did for Die Another Day has no place whatsoever in a Bond movie.  If they wanted a real Bond theme, the creative people should have gone after someone like Shirley Bassey or kd lang, whose song ""Surrender"" in Tomorrow Never Dies is the quintessential Bond theme.  Even the group Garbage would have been acceptable, because their title theme for The World Is Not Enough sounded more like a Bond theme than Die Another Day.
All in all, Die Another Day is a wonderful addition to the Bond franchise, and definitely a keeper once the DVD comes out.  Just ignore the theme song, and you'll enjoy the ride.",1045180800,3,1649,4.543918918918919

You hurry to the cinema, pay your money over, enter the auditorium, slop mustard from your hot-dog on your shirt as the lights go down. The excitement is unbearable.
The music starts and two and a half hours later your cross, very cross having sat through the biggest load of tawddle. But you are also sad, feeling betrayed by those you have trusted for 40 years. It is a feeling even worse than when you saw The Phantom menace.
This film is like a collection of the  bits of real James Bond films cobbled together in nothing more than a cynical money making excercise. The story, what there is, is from the film Diamonds are Forever, the weakest of the Franchise. Even the centre peice car chase is poorly shot. So it's bad but it gets worse, the way Ms. Monneypenny was treated at the end of the film is a disgrace. I think Mr Wilson and Ms Broccoli should apologise.

I have seen all but like one of the bond movies and Die Another Day is the one that i think is the best of them all.  I'm not some sort of bond-freak or anything, I just like the action, suspence, and girls.  This movie isn't just a good bond movie, it's one of the best action thillers i've ever seen!
For those of you who haven't seen the movie, I suggest you not read this paragraph.  After saying that, I have some comments i would like to make on the movie.  From the begining I could tell that this bond was striving to be different, stand apart from the rest.  With I new sort of begining and with Bond getting captured, I think we can say that it accomplished that.  The idea of bond being vulnerable and getting captured was a very smart move by the filmakers.  It showed that even the greastest secret agent can get captured and betrayed.
The swordfighting was magnificent.  Don't get me wrong, I love all the shooting and high-tech action sequences, I just think that the swordfighting helped to distinguish this bond move more than the other action movies that are out there.  It is like they are saying, ""Bond movies might be old, but he's still got new tricks up his sleeve.""  I think that the Bond movies have a magnificent way of adapting to the times.  This Bond gives us a totally modern plot with North Korea and all, and also gives us what we liked in the old bond movies.
Die Another Day is a great movie and I strongly suggest you see it.  Don't pay attention to all those old critics who start getting dizzy whenever there is an action sequence or a new death-defying stunt.  This is definitely a movie aimed at teenagers and young adults.  I strongly suggest you see it!",1044921600,,1786,4.3053892215568865

Although GoldenEye is great this one has that roller coaster type feeling movie fans today expect.  I thought the plot was original and the time lapse between opening scene thru the title credits was unique.  The villan was somewhat familiar yet distinct. While my title boasts this is Brosnan's best, I still like the GoldenEye probably because I immersed myself in that world through the video game for many months.  This movie also looks like a video game waiting to happen, but it'll only be good if Rareware makes it cause EA ...!

But, the story was good, Brosnan was, I fell, born to play James Bond, and I loved, loved, loved the car chase/fight between Bond and Zao!

And whats the deal with him pulling off the hood of a ice-car thing, attaching it to his feet and then sky-surfing/wave riding?  Where did the bindings on the board come from.

1453562,1,B00005JLBE,"THis should have been the tittle of this sad excuse for a movie. Of course, I know it's selling like never. No wonder. The producers, director and screenwriter gave up for sure all the old attempts to preserve a certain charm, charisma and even sometimes a small (very small) vulnerability to Bond, and changed him into a killing machine, a character that is not even likeable. One simply could care less if Bond will survive or not.
THe movie is simply bad. Millions and millions of dollars in an all-flat action movie (this is the selling point of the movie: it's one action sequence after another, without one single break. It's amazing. But the feeling I had when watching this was similiar to the one I felt when watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TWO: ok, I know I should turn my brain off to enjoy this. But why should I turn my brain off, if there are action movies (THE TWO TOWERS, for example, SPEED, for example, MATRIX, for example, PREDATOR, for example, DIE HARD, for example)that similarly absurd, but crafted with much more care and a kind of ""honesty, I don't know how to express this feeling.",1043020800,6,1103,4.63265306122449

The story is fitting to the Bond series.  There is the evil enemy, the bizarre henchmen, the plan for world destruction, and the beautiful women.  The plot is always essentially the same, but each time the path is different.  That is what makes the Bond movies great.  You can expect consistency in the style and the adventure.  The problem here is that this one tired to be something it isn't.  What I find most annoying is that it seems as if the film makers are trying to turn the franchise into a modern shoot 'em up action series.  Please stick to the formula!!!  This new film used some of the stop and pan shots found in the Matrix, as well as slo-mo shots.  This worked in the Matrix, but it adds NOTHING to the film, if not detracting from it.  The producers should have the faith in the story and characters to excite the audience and not attempt to dazzle us with special computer trickery.

In this particular edition, Bond is first in North Korea where he impersonates someone trying to buy weapons.  He succeeds for awhile, but is then betrayed and becomes a prisoner.  This part of the movie is darker than most of the series, but soon the scene shifts back to chases, love scenes, double entendres and all the usual Bondisms.  Halle Barrie looks good and does a credible job as Bond's co-spy and rumors have it that there will soon be a spin-off with her as the star.

We simply cannot care about his character and that of Halle Barry, so empty and, in the ultimate case, more cruel than the villains! The movie is an endless series of explosions, explosions, fire, death and more death. All that using a unbeliavable bad taste plot about North Korea, since the actual diplomatic situation with this country.
I'll not talk about the lies, they were some of the charm of this franchise, but here they are so stupid that I wanted to puke.",1042588800,7,758,4.580882352941177
1453625,3,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is a pretty good movie, but it's not quite a Bond film. If this was the story of 002 or 006 I'd be satisfied with it but it's not and I wasn't. A couple of things bothered me. First, why is Bond, a 00 man on a such a simple mission when he falls into enemy hands? Where was the fun? Bond movies are supposed to be escapist thrill rides. Bond hardly gets to put on his tux. Die Another Day was darn near grim throughout. MI6 does several sloppy things before and after Bond's mission that don't make sense. Q makes only a tiny appearance and Moneypenney is appallingly miscast.
What's good about the movie? Pierce Brosnon. He makes you forget the Timothy Dalton years completely. Halle Berry is a classic gorgeous Bond girl whose also quite capable of kicking butt on her own. Judi Dench as the frostiest M ever, and we finally get a villain whose crazy and evil enough to stand in the same room as the classic Bond villains. The Cuba and Iceland scenes are  quite good too.
Ultimately too much of the Bond legend is left on the cutting room floor. This wasn't much more than an oridnary spy flick. I liked it mostly but it wasn't a Bond film.",1042502400,2,1158,4.287671232876712

That out of the way, understand that I have been waiting for this film ever since walking out of the theatre after the World is Not Enough three years ago. Honestly I thought that Die Another Day would be a nice take back to the golden days of Connery as the Martini sipping, cigarette puffing snob of a secret agent. Ok, so I expected too much. Bond has to compete with xXx and other blow 'em up movies these days, I will give him that. But I am sorry to announce that I was very disappointed in Halle Berry's performance. Sure she's easy on the eyes, but entirely inconvincable as a CIA agent. In one of her scenes she tries to catch a helicopter on foot with her pistol directed toward the fleeing machine. It looked to me as if she was scaired to hold the gun in front of her. Entirely too stiff in the arm and not even trying to aim. Like I said I am a die hard fan of the movie series and the original books. Perhaps I expect too much. But does ""yo' mama"" have any place in the realm of sophisticated, international secret agent James Bond? This viewer believes not.

1453627,3,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" is a reasonably entertaining installment in the seemingly endless James Bond series - provided you don't go into the theater expecting too much that is.  This edition boasts an utterly preposterous plot (that goes almost without saying in films of this type), spectacular stunts and special effects (except for one really badly done shot of Bond boogie boarding down an ice floe), cool gizmos and gadgets, and one of the most beautiful Bond girls of all time in the person of none other than Academy Award winner Halle Berry.  Ms. Berry is not the only Oscar-winning actress to lend her talents to this venture, however.  Dame Judi Dench brings her own touch of class to the festivities as Bond's brittle, starchy boss, known only as M (one does get the sense, however, that the British grand dame is doing a bit of slumming appearing in a work of this caliber).
Like most Bond flicks, this one runs about a half hour longer than it should.  And one does begin to feel that these films have gone so far over-the-top in their plotting and style that there really isn't a whole lot of humanity left in the series.  That's where Pearce Brosnan comes in.  He provides enough of a down-to-earth quality to help keep the film at least somewhat grounded in reality, which is certainly necessary considering just how cartoonish in nature many of the action scenes are in this picture.  The fact that the North Koreans serve as the arch villains of the story might have lent the film a patina of social relevance were the sociopolitical issues not dealt with in so utterly absurd a way.
There is one amusing scene wherein Bond looks with wry disdain at the retinue of  ""high tech"" spy devices from the past, including many used in the very earliest 007 pictures.  That kind of bemused self-ribbing is all to the good in a film as lightweight in substance as this one.
There are plenty of better films playing out there right now that could certainly use even a smidgen of the box office proceeds that will be generated by this movie, but ""Die Another Day"" is must viewing for any hardcore fanatic of the Bond called James.",1042243200,,2131,4.63129973474801

This is good, but I have hear this before many times before, so I took the postive news about this movie with a grain of salt. After seeing it, I have to say that I have to agree with them, is is a good moive, much better than the pervious movie ""The World Isn't Enough"". In fact I feel asleep during that movie, but so with this movie.
With the movie, I have to admit that the first half-hour of the movie started out slow and I thought that it was going to be a waste of my time and my money. Then the movie really starts to pick up and make the movie wroth the time and money.
I have to admit the fight scene were a lot more fluid than other fights before that movie, and it looks that where influnces from The Martix and John Woo. With two wicked sword fights that are par with sword fights that would come out an Anime movie or series.
The humor is typical for any movie from this series, some jokes will hit in the head, while others will just past you bye. Also M and Q get more screen time than before.

1453704,4,B00005JLBE,"A friend of mine differentiated for me years ago about a movie and a gig. Franchises such as Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones, Austen Powers, & James Bond are rendered as gigs, which under no circumstances should be compared with movies.  A gig is when we expect what to get even BEFORE movie starts.  For that, this offering of 'Die Another Day' is one of the best yet.  I guess with the upcoming franchises such as 'XXX', it has no option but to up the ante, so as not to lose the younger generation catchment.  The movie constantly reminded us of the cliches that James is up for the hottest babes, quickest cars, gadgets, martini, smokes (all politically incorrect stuff) except saving the world in the dying hour.  Then, there were the smart lines with Q's predecessor, performed by Sir John Cleese, the sexual tension moment with Pennylover, the cheesy name for his female counterpart, Jinx (in this instance).  But 007 is no longer that two-dimensional.  Instead of introducing us to the bad guy straight away, we were kept in suspense till the final hours.  Zhao (played by Rick Yune), one of the baddies is very effective, indeed.  James is no longer invisible.  Rather, early in the intro, he was captured & tortured until his release.  Moreover, he's not THE person who held the chip but a person who was used like a pawn to serve the purpose of the British Secret Service.  His license to kill cancellation was what made him even more lethal as a person who had got nothing to lose.  James' females are no longer that predictable and double crossing, and betrayal are just a stroll in the park, not unlike Sophie Marceau's role in the previous offering.  For sheer entertainment value, this is a Bond with an edge.  Everything is bigger, better.  Even the sex scene would steam up the sauna.  The car chase between the Vantage & the Jag was awesome.  Many guys were glued to their seats with their agape mouths, cherishing every moment of it.  In terms of logic, there were far too many loopholes but remember, this is afterall, a gig.  If you were to take this movie too seriously, why bother watching Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter.  Moreover, shouldn't be going to movies is a mean of forgetting about reality once in a blue moon, that there are superheroes and superheroines afterall, and that they make this world a better place?  One thing though, the North Korea incident depicted in this movie is too close to comfort with the real thing, and just imagine how this world would come up to should Kim Jong Il Sung got his hands upon the Icarus weapon as in this movie.",1041379200,3,2588,4.61706783369803

1453707,4,B00005JLBE,"After reading all the comments on this site, one thing became clear: DAD is a very different Bond installment ... Bond for the 3rd millennium?
Now I've seen the movie I cannot but concur: it is indeed different.
Now, I'm an old Bond freak (came of age with Dr No, saw every next movie, couple of times, saw them again many times afterwards). I did a lot of analytic thinking on the Bond phenomenon, even started writing a number of in-depth papers (unpublished though).
SO... Over the 20 episodes, it's not the first time the ""formula"" changes. Remember YOLT? Connery had a hard time coping with the sheer extravaganza (scriptwriter Roald Dahl had only one limit: the sky) and did not really convince in that one.
Next, in DAF, Connery -again- had to work in a slapstick-like context. Again, not very convincingly.
Then came Roger. LALD was really Brett Sinclair taking over the 007 code. Remember Bond in Harlem? Dressed like a lord? And those cigars?
Followed by MWTGG an absolute deep, with an inept Bond, a psychotic Scaramanga without any megalomania to speak of.
Then up again with the extravaganzas of TSWLM and Moonraker. Once more the sky was the limit. And Moore surfing on the waves of ridicule...
So back to more realism and probably three of the best Moore episodes. Alas, Roger became too old and went.
Dalton brought another Bond, more fleming-esque. Culminating in a rogue Bond out for vengeance in the much harsher LTK. It was generally disliked by the audiences. Pity. But normal: we came to appreciate Bond as a somewhat ruthless operator, aptly fighting the dark wars of ""clean"" society against alarming menaces (cold war screwballs, megalomaniacs), bon vivant, taking pleasure in his job and somewhat sarcastic about it. Self-parody is certainly a term to use here. So, a Bond who has such strong personal feelings as to go for vengeance is bewildering, too close to ourselves for comfort. We can still identify with him, but no longer as the hero we all dreamt of being.
Out went Dalton. And a seven year wait. In came Brosnan. And a new style. Harder, more destructive action, more in line of what other movies had done. With four different directors, all of them having a try at the formula, with more or less success. Tamahori went the farthest: rapid action, dynamic editing, split-second scenes... That's the visual aspect. What's bothering me more is the general impression that Bond doesn't enjoy himself or the mission any more. Again it's a vengeance, a personal matter. He's dropped by M (""you're no longer useful!""), on his own. He's not enacting our secret desires, but his own. He never smiles. Takes the girls as they come along, no romantic line at all. He's harsh, ruthless, bitter even. Not at all what we have come to expect. Adding the disturbing start: Bond captive, tortured at length, kept captive for 14 months and then traded for his Nemesis. One would have expected Bond to escape somehow. Has our man lost his grip on events? On the other hand, all of this is strangely reminiscent of Fleming's Man with the Golden Gun, but that novel was not highly acclaimed.
I don't care about CGI being good or not. I don't care about unrealistic gadgetry. That's all part of the game (and is up to the present day filmic standards). No. What worries me is that Bond displays an end of career syndrome: he doesn't like the job any more, is in risk of being ""terminated"" (possibly literally), sticks to values that are long gone ... He's no longer of this time and day...
Not a Bond movie, but more a movie ""about Bond""...
This being said, a couple of nice performances (if short): Judi Dench as the ""hard but just"" boss, John Cleese reprising Q's role. I'm less impressed by the two ladies (Miranda & Jinx), not in acting, but in story value. Some of the lines given to them are just plain silly. The villain and his henchman are adequate, though. They have the right dimension, an alarming purpose and sufficient means to realize it.
In conclusion: an intriguing Bond movie, definitely worth seeing. It has all it needs for people to heavily dislike it, but also for others to highly acclaim it.",1041206400,6,4131,4.7229916897506925
1453708,4,B00005JLBE,"A wonderfully entertaining movie, the 20th installment of the legendary series delivers everything anyone could ask for in a Bond film.  This 007 movie follows the formula that has made all the others a joy.
There are the usual cool cars, beautiful women, nifty gadgets and outrageous actions that we all love. One scene was especially impressive and stood out among all the others in my mind, the fencing duel that bond takes part in escalades into an amazing movie experience and was worth the price of admission. Adding in some humor, based on the classic 007 flicks, really added to the atmosphere and made the movie a complete and solid package.
All the Bond movies are awesome and somewhat surreal adventures that should be enjoyed and not overly criticized because of the ""that can't happen"" scenes.

Think about the theme songs of other Bond movies, elaborate, sexy, orchestrated, smooth.....here she comes with her supposed ""electronic"" style and completely ruins it.
But this isn't a song review, it's a movie review.  It's a good film, and of course, if you're a Bond fan you should watch it.  But just put aside a few things when you come across them in the film, like an invisible car....and a Bond Girl who uses the words ""yo mamma""....I mean come on, where did Bond find this Bond girl, at the ""Barbershop""?....
Since Ford now has control over the Bond cars, it was interesting to see the entire lineup of companies they've bought over the past few years...representation from Volvo, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Jaguar...the only ""Ford"" card was the Thunderbird....
Gosh, and I still haven't reviewed the movie, maybe that's b/c I don't want to since I'll focus on its weaknesses (like Bond parasailing over a 200 ft wave on a piece of metal and a makeshift parachute) rather than on the good parts....and there is one very, very, funny part - and it's happens towards the end with Moneypenny - it's worth watching just to see that part.

1453789,2,B00005JLBE,"This is a very disappointing film.
Can't they get better titles...DIE Another Day, Live And Let DIE, Tomorrow Never DIES...and the title song...oh no....
The plot opens strongly, with Bond being imprisoned for 14 months.  When he was in front of the firing squad, I really feared for his life...but from that point on the film goes down hill...rapidly...
The subsequent action and stunts are so far over the top that the film plays like a cartoon.  This weakens the suspense and danger elements to such an extent that it is laughable, and as such, Bond does not appear to be at risk.  Along with a dark and weak plot, weak villain, and weak dialog, the film becomes just another ""shoot em up"" action film.  Even as a stand alone action film, it's pretty awful.
The hovercraft sequence was just a revamp of the opening of TWINE - very boring.  An invisible car...you've got to be kidding...is this a James Bond Aston Martin, or Klingon Bird of Prey in Star Trek ?  The film just limps from one stunt set up to another.  The sword fight was sooooooo boring and pointless (woops) that I almost fell asleep.
I have to say that Brosnan is looking old, and brings no warmth to the character.  He is not even likeable as Bond.  He plays the role similar to Dalton, but not as well.  He is only one dimensional - like a cardboard cut out...there is no human side to him.  Isn't Bond meant to be charming ?  Brosnan is capable of this - I saw him in Melbourne, a few weeks ago at the Australian premiere of the film.  I got more charm out of him in two minutes face to face, than I did in two hours plus on the screen.
Bring back Roger Moore...everyone criticised the way he played Bond, but I feel if it was not for him, we would not be watching Bond films today.
The other problem is that the current films are too dark, and need to lighten up.  Every Brosnan movie has him with a machine gun spaying bullets everywhere in the most brainless fashion - he's meant to be an assassin, not the Terminator.  Give us a plot that is fun as well as being suspenseful...and with a basis in reality...or possibility.  The Bond films always prided themselves on giving us technology prior to it happening...even in one of Bond's worst plot lines in Moonraker, we got the space shuttle (prior to it being launched)...however it was still based in fact.  We all know that an invisible car will NEVER ever happen.  Without a little reality, it all becomes a bit silly.  He might as well be Supeman, or Spiderman.
I appreciate all the Bond references to the other films in DAD, as well as the Q scenes, but they are lost in the disappointment of the rest of the film.
Bring Bond back (as they did with ""For Your Eyes Only"" after ""Moonraker"".  Add some style, and stunts that RELATE to the film - not to break the ""plot"" up.  And lighten up the style of the film and Bond himself..make it believable so that he really appears in danger, and make Bond likeable.",1040860800,3,2937,4.391866913123844
1453790,5,B00005JLBE,"I saw the movie last night and God, it was great with some weak points. I am not going to discuss the great architectures, settings or the amazing Aston Martin Vanquish. These are elements that got me speechless! But what I didn't like that matters the most:
1. The ability of a car to disappear... this was a long shot! But some may have swallowed it.
2. The ugly color of the Jaguar (the villain car)! Come on, this color is not even on the list of Jaguar... why did they up this silly color?!!
3. At the end of the movie where you see the Lamborghini & Ferrari that fell from the plane are planted vertically in earth without a scratch or broken glass..! Come on, this was a silly mistake!!!
4. I missed old Q! (may his soul rest in peace)
5. I missed the old Money Penny!
But this movie had so many great new features:
1. For the first time ever we see James Bond looks like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"". I mean yes, at last he is human. He gets arrested, no tuxedo, dust, dirt and humiliated.
2. Spectacular Hovercraft chase. Does Amazon.com sell these things? :-)
3. Spectacular sword fight.
4. Ok, I know I said I won't mention it but come on SPECTACULAR CAR CHASE on ice.
5. Amazing new gadgets... I loved the ring!
6. And did you see the ICE hotel?!!! WOW!!!
007 again breaks a new dimension with ""Matrix"" style camera movement... to those who are classical they may not like it but I loved it.
In the end, this James Bond movie has reserved a seat in the new 21st century! Don't miss watching this movie... and look forward to the great extra features that should be available on DVD :-)",1040774400,2,1592,4.274834437086093
1453791,5,B00005JLBE,"First of all let me say that I have seen all the bond film, and Connery is the best Bond, but his films would flop in the box office today.  Brosnan is the Bond for the younger generation, and the series has evolved with him.  Connery's gave us steller performances for the sixties, but the times have changed, and those Bond films are a testimant to a simpler time.  In Die Another Day the bad guys are over the top, the women are gorgeous, and the explosions are huge.  The sword duel between Bond and his nemisis was epic, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  If you want nostalgia rent Goldfinger, if you want cutting edge Bond action watch Brosnan in Die Another Day.  So to all those aging bond fans who have Connery and Moore on the brain watch out, because Brosnan is back and he's the Bond for a new generation!",1040688000,3,830,4.2215189873417724
1453792,5,B00005JLBE,"40 years going, and still strong. You can't say that about any other film character or franchise. Going to a James Bond movie is like going to a McDonald's. You always pretty much know what you are going to get and you wouldn't want it any other way. If you are a Bond fan, that's how you'd want it. However, there are things in this entry that are new and different. We'll get into that a bit later. I also have to point out that I am going to scream and pull my hair out if I have to read another review saying how old Pierce Brosnan looks. If you have eyes and a brain stem, you will see that this is far from the truth. He doesn't look any different than usual. People, if you have to ridicule, then do something that actually has truth to it will ya?. If you complain about oldness, then you must be pretty young. Here's the story - The film opens with Bond in North Korea being caught, after a fun, slam bang chase scene, and held prisoner by Colonel Moon. 14 months later, Bond is traded back to his people in trade for Zao(Rick Yune). But all is not well. Bond, with long, dirty hair and full beard, is told by M that he is now useless. He doesn't serve a purpose. Someone where Bond was ratted on an American. Bond goes against orders and sets out to find out who betrayed him. Along the way, he meets up with a sexy woman named Jinx(Hallee Berry),who is a bit mysterious in her own right, and tries to stop a maniac named Gustav Graves(Toby Stephens, Maggie Smith's son)from destroying the world(again?!)with the help of a sattelite. This Gustav Graves may not be who you think he is. This is what makes the character. It's an interesting premise, but the villain is rather weak. It would of paid off even better if the villain was a bit more interesting and villainous. Stephens does do an admirable job as Gustav. You really want him to get his in the end. If you really want the bad guy to get his comeuppance, then you know the actor must of done a pretty good job in playing it so you'd want that. Pierce Brosnan is Bond. He and the character fit like a glove. They were made for each other. He was the only possible choice. He really comes into his own here. He's always been good, but in this film he seems to BE Bond. It's his most interesting performance of the character so far in his 4 films as 007. One hopes for 4 more. Connery is the best, but Brosnan comes real close. Bond women have evolved over the years. They are smarter. They are stronger. They are more evolved and interesting. Hallee Berry as Jinx proves that. She is sexy as all get out, but tough and smart. She makes the character come alive and have her own agenda. She's the first Bond woman to come along to be Bond's equal. It's no surprise there are plans for her own spin off film. That's never happened before. Some other reviewers simply didn't get it. The action here is big and teriffic. Some things may be overdone, but that's the way we like it. It has some breathtakingly choreographed action scenes that take you in and never let go. Some of the best of the recent Bond films. However, there is one moment that is really bad. The scene with Bond going over the edge of the glacier. That scene with his race car banging on the side was very hokey looking. Other than that, it was all good. The main theme by Madonna is a bit of a let down. It doesn't sound like a Bond song. The theme songs always sound bigger than life and campy and have a spy like sound to them. This one is too techno/dance/modern. It is certainly alright and catchy as a Madonna song, but fails as a theme to a 007 movie. Madonna has a decent little cameo in the film as well. John Cleese steps into the role of Q, and it is a bit of inspired casting. Brilliant!. He's perfect. His scene is one of the best in the film. Character actor Michael Madsen also appears in the film, but he is mysteriously left out of the credits. The action is outstanding, the sets are teriffic, and Bond is as good as ever. Who could want anything more?. Since it is the 20th film and the 40th anniversary, there are some homages to past Bond films. I caught them. Can you?. Bond also gets a jazzier aston martin that can turn invisible. It's about time!. There are scenes with a ' Matrix ' style flare to them and it is welcome in the Bond series. The humor and one liners fly all around. Some are funny, but some are also groan inducing. ""Die Another Day"" is a flashy, slam bang action film that delivers fun and adventure and delivers it. It could quite possibly be the best Bond film in a long time. Brosnan's best outing yet. We need it. If you read other reviews, you will see that it was lost on a lot. It's still James Bond, and nobody does it better. Nobody will even come close. Not even over the top, lame, plotless excursions into mediocrity like ""XXX"". That line ' James Bond Will Return ' that appears at the end of every Bond film is always welcomed. Never more so than at the end of this one. Bond will return?. We can only hope so.",1040515200,3,4999,4.2356020942408374
1453793,1,B00005JLBE,"GAWD! Well! This movie closed the deal on great remembrances of classic James Bond movies.  Ha, never again will there be another.  Where to begin on so many disappointments?  First off, the music!  Techno?!?! Come on man!  Im a fan of techno, but for a Bond Flick?!? Never, good sirs!  It simply diminishes the name James bond!  Though they tried to hold onto their symphony sounding like roots, it didn't work! If you're a diehard fan and know good Bond films, from the start with that music, you can drop your popcorn and go home friends.  You just know it's going to ....!  However, I vaguely recall the original music being somewhere, but that's what makes the movie!!!  DERN DERN DA DERN DEN!  You people know the tune; it being real loud during an action scene makes the movie.  Pfft, it was too hard to tell with everything blowing up every second.  Man, so commercialized!  Geez'es man!  NORELCO!? Therefore, what?  Is that like supposed to tell females to get their men Norelco shavers because Mr. Bond does! ""If I get my husband this shaver then he'll think he's bond!""  PFFFT!!  Or ""Hey!!!  Bonds got a Norelco, better pick me one up after the movie!""  Music, Commercializing, and the constant action appeals too much to the younger demographic.  Well, I guess with all your Mtv's, B.E.T's and ""For those who think young"" society geared that direction, it's no wonder the movie is how it is.  The movie was entirely predictable!  (Don't read on if haven't seen the movie)  Guy in the punching bag, HA!  Alternatively, the line at the start ""saved by the bell.""  ZzZzZzZ Man, can't even fawking blink because you'll miss seeing like fifty buildings/hover crafts blowing up or without missing the movie dam it. Movie tries to secretly push for Madonna...nothings happening then bam!  You see that creamy life form! I guess shes trying to make a come back. lol
So 2 recap!  If you're young with hormones all over or have noting to do but to see such a movie, then go!  Alternatively, if your just curious and intelligent to know it blows but your going to see it anyway, then go.  But, if your highly intelligent and don't waste your time with ignorance, then your good to stay away.  Real James Bond fans or Bond Connoisseurs keep watching gold finger.

1453795,5,B00005JLBE,"I tend to disagree with people who dislike the new Bond movies. I have all 22, and yes the classics are with Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Those are the classics, I mean Timothy Dalton and Ian Flemming, they starred in like one movie. Those aren't the real Bond's. The REAL ones are Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. When you look at Pierce Brosnan, he plays out a well potrayed Bond. Sexy, seductive, smart, suave...and he always gets his girl (lucky....lol) He may not carry emotion, or pain, but neither did the others. Thats the life of a 007. I'm telling people right now to watch Die Another Day, it's full of action, romance, seduction and of course Vodka Martinis, shaken not stirred. Plus that, Hallie Berry is amazing. Not to mention there is a cameo apearance by one popular music artist. ;) It was well worth my nine bucks, so it will be worth everyone elses money. Go see it. Now.",1040256000,,905,4.524390243902439
1453796,2,B00005JLBE,"So here it is, the latest installment of the Austin Powers franchise. Except, no, hang on a minute, its actually James Bond 20, Die Another Day, although the comparisons are undeniable. In a plot very similar to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, bad guy Gustav Graves, more Scott Evil than Dr Evil with that coiffure, wants to take over the world and conquer the nasty western imperialists using a frickin' big laser, codenamed Icarus. Or should that actually be The Alan Parsons Project? I'm confused! Okay, so I'm being a smart arse but it seems terribly ironic to me that for the 40th anniversary, and 20th movie, of the longest running (and most succesful) franchise in cinema history that the producers should fail to notice the similarities in plot between Die Another Day and Austin Powers, which openly lampoons the Bond films.
The tragedy is that Die Another Day opens very promisingly with an excellent set piece of Bond and two other agents surfing through enormous waves before landing on the coast of North Korea. From there we then have another excellent set piece as Bond tries to make an improbable escape from the nasty North Korean arms dealers. The credit sequence is very good too, with a harder edge than is normal for Bond credits, as we see 007 being systematically tortured. At this point I'm thinking excellent, best Bond movie for a long time. New harder more serious Bond for the 21 st century. This for the most part continues even with Madonna making an unnecessary cameo, where despite only having about two minutes screen time, she once again demonstrates her carpentry skills, sorry I mean acting skills.
We also get some great nods to the legacy of Bond as Pierce Brosnan tours Q's laboratory full of 007's old gadgets. We even get a great Flemingesque fencing match between the baddie Gustav Graves and Bond. There is of course the total silliness of discovering that 007's latest gadget is an invisible car (purlease) but I suspended my horror and disbelief and caried on hoping this was going to be a rather silly but minor glitch in the proceedings. Then we had the marvellous sight of Halle Berry, possibly the best Bond girl ever, emerging from the waves as the new Bond girl a la Ursula Andress in Dr No. In fact everything is going swimmingly until the movie reaches Gustav Graves ice palace in Iceland, where everything falls apart with a combination of a poor script, rubbish plot and some very awful CGI. What I want to know is, what muppet thought that having Bond kite surfing was in any way shape or form a good idea? It was like watching one of those old movies where people drive along in cars with a movie playing behind them of a country road. You know what I mean, the kind of thing that they did before they invented blue screens and digital special effects. Awful!!! From then on it doesn't get any better, the script seems to get worse and more cliched and the film becomes more and more reliant on second rate CGI special effects. Plus, the comparisons with Austin Powers don't stop at the laser plot. The script is full of the kind of rubbish puns and silly plot points, which Mike Myers lampoons with Dr Evil and his son Scott. Plus Toby Stephens as the Bond villain is well, how can I put it, rubbish? He's a crass middle/upper class English public schoolboy vaguely reminiscent of Diana's former love interest, James Hewitt (does anybody remember that cad)? I mean, ooh, how scary, not. Please don't beat me up with your posh voice Bond must have pondered.

All that said, there are some good points. Brosnan is as ever a fantastic Bond and the only actor to seriously rival Sean Connery in the part of the suavest secret agent in the world. Also, as previously mentioned, Halle Berry is possibly the classiest Bond girl ever and perhaps the only A list actress to star in a Bond movie whilst at the peak of her career. Ive been a fan of Ms Berry's since I first saw her in The Last Boy Scout, all of ten years ago and the only thing that has surprised me is that it has taken her this long to get the recognition that she has deserved. In fact, Berry as the American secret agent Jinx was probably a bit too classy for this movie and in the end is sorely wasted. Yes Bond 20 also has its moments but ultimately the movie as a whole is terribly dissapointing and certainly the worst Bond movie of the Brosnan era.",1040256000,4,4378,4.555837563451776
1453797,2,B00005JLBE,"For almost 40 years, Q-branch has managed to produce spy toys that pushed the envelope just enough that they could be fun if you didn't get too deconstructive.  This movie blasted through the envelope with an invisible car and a holodeck, reducing Bond from a suave, almost believable secret agent to this decade's next sci-fi character.
I was skeptical about Halle Berry being a Bond girl, as she is so well established and distractingly beautiful, but she held the movie together.
I only hope that Ms. Broccoli is through with her experimentation, will fire her director, [fire] her writers, and continue the tradition of James Bond in a spirit more becoming of the legacy set before her.",1040083200,8,690,4.897435897435898
1453887,2,B00005JLBE,"Diamonds, DNA or doomsday?  Writers, please make up your minds.  This story feels like the nervous (or lazy) agglomeration of too many ideas, too many opinions, and not nearly enough good sense.  Had the very surprising anti-British/American angle taken up in the opening scene been retained, this could have been a vastly more entertaining night out.  But it's a Bond film, after all, so provocative subtext is quickly swept aside to make way for hot chicks, cool gadgets, and a one-dimensional megalomaniac villain with - surprise, surprise - some freakish henchmen and a doomsday device up his sleeve (this time, quite literally).  But while it hits all the traditional Bond notes, it somehow just doesn't play.  Halle Berry is wasted, as are Rick Yune and relative newcomer Rosamund Pike (""Grace Kelly bio-pic, here I come."")  Brosnan goes through the motions capably enough (copious chest-hair notwithstanding), but Toby Stephens is simply laughable as the villainous Gustav Graves.  It doesn't help that he plays him uncannily like Rik Mayall's Lord Flasheart from ""Blackadder"".  Even the trademark, innuendo-laced dialogue is surprisingly flaccid - ironically, it now sounds like an ""Austin Powers"" script, but without the nerve go all the way.  The digital effects are far too obvious (only the climactic sequence really impresses), but it's the ""stunts"" they're used to create that really annoy - Bond's escape from the iceberg goes too far, even for this franchise of cinematic impossibility.  As in the ""Star Wars"" prequels, it isn't so much the quality of the effects which grates - it's the low quality of the writing they're trying to represent.  With so many Bond parodies and knock-offs crowding the market these days - from the deliberately funny (""Austin Powers"") to the unintentionally hilarious (""xXx"") - the original franchise is going to have to do much more than just trade on its name.  It can't be that hard.  Just start with a decent script.",1040083200,5,1967,5.12539184952978
1453888,1,B00005JLBE,"The Bond series has produced some fine movies, such as ""You Only Live Twice"", and some awful ones, such as ""Moonraker"", possibly one of the worst movies ever.  And this one almost beat it.  ...
There is a difference, folks, between the need for suspension of disbelief (especially for sci-fi films) and being cretinous.  Mainly, I mean to say this: the laws of physics exist, whether you like it or not.  If a car falls 30,000 feet, AT LEAST the windows will break.  Also, surfing a super-sonic wave just can't happen, folks. .... P>And never mind the acting.  The only two who save themselves are Brosnan and Berry, who do satisfactory jobs.  I understand Bond films aren't dramas of the highest order ...  Toby Stephens, who plays Gustav Graves, is so bad it isn't even laughable.
It is indeed true that the 007 series is made with the must-shut-off-the-brain gospel which our dear friends at Hollywood have been piously spreading since Day One, and they no doubt influenced the makers of all the Bond movies.  ....

1453889,5,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan's fourth outing as James Bond 007, has obviously been thought out well; and as a result, it's probably the most enjoyable action film of 2002 (blasting the awful XXX into orbit). With a popular Madonna theme song to back this new direction in a Bond film, D.A.D. deserves praise for daring to be different, while keeping all the right traditional elements at the same time. Halle Berry and Rosmaund Pike are good choices as good and evil Bond girls, and the ice lake car chase between Bond and enemy Xao (Rick Yune) is incredible. Just the sight of Bond using his ejector seat to return his overturned Aston Martin to upright can make anyone smile!

1453890,1,B00005JLBE,"After 40 years maybe Bond should retire. This is indeed Brosnan's weakest film as James Bond. It's a shame because the film starts off very promising showing a more human and vulnerable James Bond, but this development quickly diminishes into a ridiculous plot and even more ridiculous action sequences that make the film seem more like a parody on the Bond franchise; including multiple unneeded references to the previous Bond films.
This film try's to breath some fresh air into the standard James Bond plot with bond becoming a rogue agent to extract his revenge, but this fails to work and quickly becomes the clich plot that the majority of the films follow. This was done in a much more effective way in 1989's License to Kill. The villains and the women are some of the least interesting in the entire franchise. Denise Richards even made a better Bond girl then Halle Berry, and do we really need to see the image of a bikini glad babe slowing coming out of water yet again on film?
The action sequences have always been the backbone of the series with each film trying to outdo its predecessor. But the action in this film is so ridiculous that it could not be filmed with stuntmen but instead with Brosnan on a green screen and CGI effects added. Nothing is memorable and the scenes are quickly forgotten.
Something new has to be done with this series, because if it continues the way it's going, a James Bond film will be no more interesting then it countless imitators. Maybe it's time for a more serious Bond movie like the early Connery films or even the Dalton films. I hear Brosnan is going to make one more film. Roger Moore made his best and what should have been his last film - For Your Eyes Only after his worst and the most ridiculous film in the entire series - Moonraker. Maybe history will repeat itself; or the Bond films won't be worth watching.",1039910400,10,1873,4.560830860534125

The beggining was EXCELLENT, Real stunts, back to basics, kick BEHIND bond. but then in the second half, the sci-fi, xxx feel came into it, that for one I did not like.  I reminded me of Moonraker with the space fight at the end all the way through the 2nd half. 2. I thought James Bond would be the ONE spy series that would stand the test of time by using CGI right. As in backgrounds and such. CGI was used WAY 2 MUCH. Bond going down that wave, the plane sequence, the helicopter falling. COME ON. This isent XXX.  But it seems that like the whole movie was trying to compete with XXX.  Bonds of the past used REAL STUNTS, and everything your seeing on the screen is real in some way. I NEVER THOUGHT I would come away from a bond movie that I wasent that impressed with.  The old bonds used stunt man, real stunts that made the movies real and CGI can NEVER rival.  Thats why XXX is so bad.  Bond 21 better only use CGI sparingly, or Bond will end up a classier XXX.

1453894,4,B00005JLBE,"Who can say no to James Bond? This movie is packed with Action! It was really exciting to see it in the Imax.
There were alot of Action sequences including a hovercraft chase, a sword duel, a brawl in a laser room, a fight aboard a jetplane and of couse a gun fight with two cars.
James Bond(Pierce Brosnan is sent to deliver diamonds to Korean Colonel Moon and kill him. After killing him, he is capured by his father. Fourteen Months Later, James Bond is traded for Zao(Rick Yune), a criminal envolved in Moon's group when Bond blew diamonds into his face. Bond, having his license revoked again(second time including Licence To Kill), escapes to Cuba to hunt for Zao. He later meets Jinx(Halle Berry), an unlucky agent born on Friday the 13th. Bond goes back to London after Zao escapes. He meets the King of Diamonds Gustav Graves(Toby Stephens) and his secretary Miranda Frost(Rosmund Pike). Bond is invited to an event in Iceland involing one of Graves' satellites. 007 finds out that Graves isn't really how he seems. Bond then gets his License To Kill back.
Pretty good storyline and plot, but Gustav Graves isn't a very memorable villian. Hate to admitit, but Graves isn't even a better villian that Renard(The World Is Not Enough). Halle Berry didn't have the Acadamy Amard acting this time and wasn't a very memorable Bond girl. She was too much like Pam Bouvier(Licence To Kill) and Wai Lin(Tomorrow Never Dies). Zao was a pretty darn good henchman(possibly memorable). Pierce Brosan was(for the fourth time) terrific. Dame Judi Dench reprises her role as M. John Cleese changes his role from R to Q and takes Desmond Lewelyn's spot as Q. ""I guess I'll Die Another Day!""",1039219200,11,1682,4.744027303754266
1453895,4,B00005JLBE,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is the 20th in the bond series. It has a nice twist in that in the beginning 007 fails and becomes a POW. It the twists in the story that make this film very interesting. Pierce Brosnon (Remington Steel, The Thomas Crown Affair, The World Is Not Enough) does a great job in this film and seems to play vulnerability well. The story is that of a terrorist and diamond collector wanna-be that develops a device that could - you guessed it - destroy the world. Directed by Lee Tamahori (Mullholland Falls) this is the technically finest of any of the Bond films. Score by David Arnold ( )
This film has action and gadgets like you wouldn't believe. The star prop in this film, is, as in most of the Bond films, his car. This one is invisible. Not to mention his high tech watch and incredible stunts like you haven't seen before. The effects and technology have changed so much that you can't tell what's real and what is digital. Oh, and did I mention that James Bond always gets the girl? Or, ""Girls"" rather?
Now the cast is very cool. Halle Berry (X-men, Monsters Ball, Bullworth) is really good and an American Agent and she can really strut her stuff both in the bedroom and when she is dodging bullets. There is swordplay and fighting, chasing, car crashes, airplane explosions, laser destruction, high-speed ice battles and so much more. The villains are played by Toby Stephens (Space Cowboys, Orlando) and Rick Yune (The Fence, Fast and Furious) .
And, you could expect nothing but the best from British Secret Service Leader - Judi Dench ( Shakespeare In Love, Iris, The Shipping News ) as ""M"" and the ever and always funny John Cleese (Holy Grail, A Fish Called Wanda ) and ""Q"".
Overall this film had action and adventure and an extreme adrenaline rush from beginning to end. The only thing that was a little ""out of place"" was the opening titles. They were not as ""Bondish"" as they usually are. Not as interesting and more abstract. However, who could be the title song sung by Madonna - who also makes a cameo appearance as a Sword Play expert. She looks good. If you are a bond fan, you'll enjoy this experience and if you are not or never seen a Bond film - you are in for the ride of your life. The film is for the whole family.

1453966,1,B00005JLBE,"Physics and biology (neither of which are my strong points) were so totally thrown out the window that almost none of the ""stunts"" were believeable. As a director, if you have to cut and splice your shots together because the stunts are impossible to perform, maybe you should try something that makes sense!
After seeing this Bond film, it will be very difficult to pry me away from my collection of classic Bond movies.  Even Roger Moore made some better movies than this one.
Oh wait, this movie is the first 19 movies all rolled into one!  Let's see:  where did we see a movie about Diamonds that had a satellite weapon which focused the power of the sun?  (I could go on and on, trust me on this).
Also, if the ""villain"" has a DNA-altering machine that can change someone's looks completely, can't it remove diamonds from someone's face?  Bring back Oddjob.  Since the rest of this movie makes no sense, his return will fit right in...
Finally: the scene where Bond takes his pistol out from under the pillow and tucks it away in his holster without making sure the clip is full and a round is in the chamber, was so out of character that it screamed that the audience was being set up for another stupid scene later.
This installment will ONLY appeal to young children and possibly teens who never watched a real action-adventure movie with a strong villain.
Next time make a Bond film I'd like: Dalton reprising the role of Bond one last time. Connery playing a villain that he has creative control over. That would get me back to the theater!",1039132800,3,1550,4.537634408602151
1453967,2,B00005JLBE,"I love James Bond. I have really enjoyed all the Brosnan Bond movies, as well. This being the case, I was very excited for the release of this film. To say that I am disapointed is a bit of an understatement.
First, what other reviewers have said here prior to my review is true: this film is increadibly unbelievable. It plays more like a ""Batman"" film than a spy movie. Granted, all Bond movies require more than the fair share of ""suspension of disbelief"", but it's always been done very toung-in-cheek. Here, it's just foolishenss. We have an invisable car, genetic enhancements, a space laser (I kept thinking about Austin Powers and Dr. Evil saying ""laaassser""), and a diamond-faced jerk as a bad guy.
I guess the most painful aspect of the whole thing is the lack of any magic or substance. The gagets are in the film for the sake of having gagets. The plot is contrived and weak, and honestly didn't even make much sense to me. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of the movie, with Bond's investigation in Cuba. However, once he and Hale Berry blew up that lab, it all went down hill. The entire ending portion taking place in the ice palace was horrific and bogus.
Even the characters were bad. Jinx was boring and shallow to say the least. The new Q is dull. Moneypenny does virtually (pun intended) nothing, and neither does M. The villans are so bad, I can't even remember them. The only vaguely interesting character is Frost, the evil babe.
This really was a stinker...it's sad, but true.
It pains me to say all this, believe me",1039132800,5,1531,4.530685920577618
1453968,1,B00005JLBE,"Attention all moviegoers: You may now stick a fork in James Bond...he's officially done!  ""Die Another Day"" is the final nail in the coffin of the once-proud franchise that produced such highly-entertaining films as ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Goldfinger"" and ""For Your Eyes Only. ""
Time was, this series relied on wit, spectacular stunts and entertaining storylines to propel a movie.  Now those successful traits have been replaced with clunky one-liners, cheesy special effects and ludicrous plotting...which, in case you were wondering, are not good things in a movie!  If you enjoy these qualities, go see the slightly-superior (aargh...I can't believe I'm saying this) ""XXX!""  Of course, choosing between ""XXX"" and ""Die Another Day"" is like deciding between death by lethal injection or drowning, but that's beside the point!
Don't get me wrong, the classic Bond films had their fair share of outrageous stunts, but at least they were within the realm of possibility...after all, the filmmakers didn't have computer graphics to rely on, they had to have actual stuntmen perform them!  But James Bond parasurfing on a glacier?  Completely ludicrous, not to mention dumb!!
I saw this film with three of my friends, and we all agreed -- ""The worst Bond film of all time!""  And that's not like saying ""The worst Indiana Jones film of all time,"" which isn't a bad thing to say because of the relative high quality of all of the films in that series.  The Bond franchise has been churning out turkeys on a regular basis for years, so saying it's the worst of them all really means something (after all, how can you make a movie worse than ""The World is Not Enough"" and ""License to Kill""?).
I want to collectively grab MGM executives, shake them for an hour, then make them sit down and watch ""good"" James Bond movies (i.e. any of the films made prior to 1987) so they can see how far they're strayed from the once fool-proof formula.  It's not hard to make a good James Bond movie, butuntil they realize what they're doing wrong (which is everything) and fix it, I will never see a ""new"" Bond movie again!",1038873600,14,2102,4.7845303867403315
1453969,4,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day was very entertaining.  At moments I thought is was as good as a James Bond movie gets (however it did not sustain that).  It is enhanced by many self-references, ranging from some obvious ones, like Halle Berry wearing Ursula Anders bikini, to more obscure ones, like Bond posing as an ornithologist after noticing a book on birds while on a Caribbean island (Ian Fleming borrowed Bond's name from the author of such a book while on Jamaica).  Another good obscure reference is to a Colonel Moon (Colonel Sun is the name of the first Bond book written by someone other than Fleming).
Through the early part of the movie, Bond gets beaten severely, is decidedly imperfect, and is essentially rejected by his own service.  This is all very refreshing.  It all makes his challenge seem more serious.  His villains seem more villainous, and Halle Berry works well as a Bond girl on par with Bond as a secret agent.
Some of the gadgets and special effects are too exaggerated.  This cartoonish aspect contrasts sharply with the rest of the movie.  But it never sinks to Roger Moore depths of silliness.  I enjoyed it very much and look forward to the series continuing.",1038873600,6,1181,4.721951219512195
1453970,3,B00005JLBE,"The 20th James Bond film not only marks the 40th anniversary series but also shows a sometimes desperate effort to make the franchise as contemporary as possible. The gadgets go way too far at times, making this seem like a comic book movie. Don't get me wrong; I love comic book heroes and comic book movies. Still, it somehow bothered me to see Bond going so far in that direction. It's a fun movie, and I enjoyed it, but the invisible car and such distracted me even more than the overly obvious product placement.
I recently read that a current internet campaign involves pushing Adrian Paul (the TV incarnation of The Highlander) as the next Bond. That sounds good, but I'm glad Pierce Brosnan agreed to at least one more Bond film beyond this one. Brosnan plays the role with the required wit and style, along with a little vulnerability. I also hope Halle Berry will reprise her role as Jinx.",1038873600,2,899,4.590062111801243
1453971,3,B00005JLBE,"Okay, I went to see Die Another Day the first weekend it came out. The story was decent and the characters were great. I especially loved Miranda Frost's part. She exuded sexuality and a kick [butt] mentality. Halle Berry as Jinx was a waste of time. She didn't contribute much to the movie but to look beautiful (as always). I think you have to be a very strong actress to pull off a James Bond Girl and Halle doesn't fit that mode. I hope she doesn't get her own spin off from the movie, as it will be a flop unless she plans to go nude as she did in Monster's Ball. Anyway, Madonna's contribution to the movie was well received. The small part she played and her song Die Another Day is a major hit and went appropriately with the movie. Not the best best James Bond but not the worst.",1038873600,,788,4.190789473684211
1453972,4,B00005JLBE,"ATTENTION ALL BOND FANS:  If you enjoy any of the older Bond films OR if you tend to be a new-age (IE Brosnan) Bond fan, you won't be disappointed in Die Another Day.  If you insist on being overly critical of the Bond series, then Bond films really shouldn't be your mainstay and ought to stick to Academy-Award calibur films.  This film is 2 hours of Bond FUN; suspend your daily lives and Die Another Day.
Die Another Day features all of the classic elements of Bond adventures (exotic locales, evil villians, action, gorgeous women, gadgets) but also introduces enough new concepts to make the whole experience unique.  Pierce Brosnan appears completely comfortable as Bond (as he did in TWINE) and gives an edgy if not somewhat predicable performance.  Halle Berry does NOT steal the show in any way as Bond's unlikely accomplice (go rent Swordfish if she is your focus), and the standard MI6 crew does a good job of supporting Bond in his latest adventure.
In DAD, Bond becomes embroiled in a North Korean plot to indulge war mongers in that country, however steeped in subterfuge.  Bond's opening scene capture & torture sends him on a mini-vendetta (aka Licence To Kill), which then evolves into a much larger mission with obvious world-saving implications (what else!).  I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of villian development in this film.  If you really savor a FRWLove or Living Daylights type of espionage film, this may not float your boat.
However, don't let this stop you.  The Bond franchise team ensures that Bond continues to set the tempo and standard for quality action thrillers.  The film is visually gorgeous, well edited, and moves rapidly without letting the audience stew for any amount of time.  David Arnold's score of DAD is perhaps his best ever, and as another reviewer noted, this score truly shows Arnold's Barry-esque roots (actually subtly sampling some older themes remixed into Arnold compositions).  It made me quite happy because Barry's scores were a HUGE component of Bond films, and those w/o it tend to be the weaker films (in my opinion).  As far as the Madonna song goes:  I originally disliked it when heard on the soundtrack--> but upon hearing/seeing it in concert with the opening credits, it seems to embody the theme of the film and gets you juiced for the anticipated adventure to unfold.
Without a doubt, one of the best Bond scenes ever takes place here in the form of the action packed car ice chase between Zao & Bond.  ALL of the Brosnan-Bond villians and henchmen have been weak so far (Stamper...); Zao proves to be sinister, evil-looking, tough, and a very cunning adversary.  You truly BEG for Bond to wipe this guy out with maximum prejudice.  As for Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), he could have been a little more evil but he'll do.  There is MUCH more to him than meets the eye.
In the negative category, I found the size of Michael ""Mr. Blonde"" Madsen's character way too insignificant.  Also, I somewhat disliked the director's attempts at ""Matrix-style"" motion FX.
As with all GOOD Bond films, DAD features an over-the-top villian lair, extraordinary evil weapons of mass destruction, and of course, a climatic larger-than-life battle between Bond & the villians with the world hanging in the balance.  Go see this movie.  Let's face it:  even if you don't think its as good as Goldfinger, it could NEVER, EVER BE AS AWFUL AS LIVE & LET DIE.",1038873600,4,3416,4.813356164383562
1453973,4,B00005JLBE,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is a riveting, action-packed adventure sure not to disappoint even the most toughened, hard-edged James Bond fanatics.  The 20th official 007 movie, drawn from the novels of Ian Fleming, opened two weeks ago to the franchise's biggest debut, blowing way behind in the dust whatever came in dollars from any previous of the Bond films.  Yet truly, this comes as no surprise at all...
The studio did exactly what one should do in order to succeed:  it revved up the vast anticipation of no less than four generations of Avid Fans - their well-cultivated dogma conjuring the now 40 years of Bond and his numerous assignments, his several endearing quips and quirks, his many, many women, as well as a sly wink to each of the four actors previous to Pierce Brosnan who had taken reign in the saddle of this, the Ultimate Role:  Bond, James Bond.
Pierce Brosnan, Bond since 1995's GOLDENEYE, is truly fine to watch in this, his 4th outing as Agent 007.  However, to this day it's GOLDENEYE that remains my favorite of his Bond films. Indeed it was the rich enchanting settings and dark atmosphere, and not Brosnan as Bond, which for me comprised GOLDENEYE'S allure.  In DIE ANOTHER DAY, it is apparent that the last seven years have given him a roughened, world-weary edge that is undeniably appealing.  He now seems comfortable in his own identifiable Bond skin - at last at home with the Role.
Yet for all the build-up preceding the Wide Theatrical Release of this film, it comes as no insignificant letdown to find it wanting in several respects:  First off, the action was often way too far over the top - beginning with a very loud, explosive opening sequence set at a Korean airbase.  Thence onward, and throughout most of the balance of the movie were numerous fantastical high-tech & very noisy action sequences that were so extraordinary it often left me wondering, ""Wow - how'd they do that?"" instead of actually caring how the plot unfolded.  A few of these scenes made my ears hurt.  The settings, as well, were a bit too imposing, but to a lesser degree - I felt that MI6 Headquarters and villain Gustav Graves' (Toby Stephens) extravagant ice palace manipulated the atmosphere negatively - at times hurting my eyes as well. All this fanfare left very little chance for character development.
Furthermore, I think Bond's Aston Martins are just about the coolest sets of wheels anyone could ever lay eyes on - so why on earth make this one invisible??  It's beyond me why, with such a clever entourage of gadgets attached to this car over the years that something so impossible should be introduced now.  Lastly, at the beginning of the film, Bond is taken prisoner in North Korea, then after 14 months is released in a trade negotiated for Graves' henchman Zao (Rick Yune) - an interesting entity whose face is embellished with diamonds courtesy of Bond in the opening sequence.  During his imprisonment, Bond is theoretically considered ""expendable,"" then upon his release is scrutinized & determined to be ""useless"" by ""M"" (Judi Dench) and all British Intelligence.  I do declare - as per in LICENCE TO KILL when Timothy Dalton's Bond goes renegade after MI6 revokes his spy privileges - it remains unfathomable that after so many years of invaluable service, teamed with such incredible heroics, that Commander Bond could so easily be dismissed!
Notwithstanding all that, I truly had fun watching this film!  The opening credits sequence was spiced up not only by an excellently suitable Madonna song, but also by intermingling flashes of Bond during his painful 14 months in the Korean prison camp - an original idea for these famously wonderful & uniquely creative opening credit sequences.  Also, I found both the Bond girls, Jinx (Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), to be lovely, as well as adeptly matched for their roles.  Though it was promised in all the pre-release promotions, I was pleasantly surprised when Jinx slinked out from the sea in that classic DR. NO fashion.  I am still unsure whether or not a Jinx spin-off Bond movie is a good idea, but still, what else can I say about Halle Berry - I think she's great!
Without doubt, the best action sequence in this movie involves a fencing match between Bond and Gustav Graves - and the way 007 toys with his opponent is a grand nod to Sean Connery's Bond and the distant past.  Also I must say that casting John Cleese as the new ""Q"" is a stroke of genius!  I am sure no one else could have filled the shoes of the late Desmond Llewelyn as James' gadget-maker.  Seeing Bond and Moneypenny finally kiss and embrace (!?) on the big-screen is another delightful treat!
Actually, there are way too many pleasant twists and surprises to be found in DIE ANOTHER DAY ever to be mentioned here.  For all that, and even though this flick was at times painful to watch, I can bestow upon it no less than four stars.  For, as with any James Bond adventure, there comes much pleasure with the pain - so I fervently encourage you all go and experience it!",1038787200,2,5046,4.727480045610034
1453974,2,B00005JLBE,"Die Another Day is, put simply, ridiculous. This is a Bond film that is so cliched and cringeworthy that it borders on looking like a parody. This film seems like all the Bond films rolled into one - which might not seem a bad thing - but every line, action sequence, or plot development seems to be stolen from another Bond film.
I suppose this film was at first somewhat entertaining and fun to watch, even if it was at times so cheesy you wanted to cover your eyes, but by the 80 minute mark I just wanted it to end. The extent to which Bond manages to survive anything is so stupid that you can only laugh.
I do wonder whether the self-parody is deliberate - either way, there were so many lines of action/hero/sexual cringeworthiness it was unbearable. Whilst parts of the film were enjoyable, it is poor as a film.",1038787200,4,820,4.366013071895424
1453975,4,B00005JLBE,"Okay, something everyone should keep in mind: we go to the 007 films to relax and enjoy a couple hours of escapist fun. ""Die Another Day"" delivers this promise. True, it is not the best of the series, but it certainly isn't the worst (""Moonraker"", ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""A View To A Kill"" ... sounding familiar?). The acting was decent, as well as could be expected from a Bond film (let us all forget Denise Richards, please!). Many complain that the film has too many elements which are new to the series (such as the updated gun barrel intro, and the ""Matrix""-style camera moves), but just look back at the past 20 films, and it's easy to see that the 007 films have been all about change with each new decade. To be honest, I had my doubts while watching the film - is all this intense, hi-tech action perhaps a bit over the top? After a few rounds of reflection and a second viewing of the film, I came to a conclusion: yes, it's all rather over the top, but the film plays out with it's tongue in cheek - with panache. When one really thinks about it, ""Die Another Day"" is 2002's version of 1977's over-the-top ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", a Bond film which pushed the envelope of believability in a jaw-droppingly fun manner. So, relax folks - if this wasn't your kind of Bond film, there's 19 before it and many more to come in the future, and not a resounding death-knell of the franchise as some cry. Remember, this review, like all the others, is just one persons' opinion - go and form your own conclusions.",1038787200,12,1516,4.398576512455516
1454075,5,B00005JLBE,"Although ""Mr. 007"" is entering a new millennium, don't expect all the madcap mayhem and crime-fighting excitement to be of the high-tech variety, which for the most part, isn't any more or less advanced when compared to other James Bond adventures, as is the case of ""Die Another Day"". All of the ingredients presented in the scenic and ""chase-like"" ambience one has come to expect in previous Bond outings is still intact, which all the more makes virtually any James Bond film worthy of many a look-see. Pierce Brosnan has never been more debonair, stunning and cunning in his role as everyone's favorite ""spy"". Halle Berry is equal to the task as 007's sexy and able assistant - a formula which has worked wonders in prior Bond flicks. Regardless of the various actors whom have filled (the role of) James Bond's shoes (from Sean Connery through Brosnan), Bond has always shown unadulterated prowess and finesse in his attempts at catching the bad guys (with the bad guys usually losing out in the end, of course). From (mostly) exotic locales in this movie ranging from North (& South) Korea to Hong Kong to Cuba to Britain, ""Die Another Day"" is truly a first-class ticket to a world filled with a grand degree of mystery and intrigue, all done in 360 degree 007 fashion.

I would recommend that you see this movie while it is still in theaters to catch all the edge of seat action sequences in full screen with good sound.

1454077,4,B00005JLBE,"This is the first Brosnan as Bond film I've seen. He is probably the best Bond since Roger Moore. The opening sequence is terrific. All the special effects are very good. Halle Berry as Jinx, the capable American agent, and John Cleese as Q, are excellent. Judy Dench is not right as M, and I didn't care for Smantha Bond as Moneypenny.
It's a typical Bond plot with the usual bad puns and double entendres. The plot takes Bond from North Korea, to Hong Kong, to Cuba, to London, to Iceland. This time the evil genius is a nefarious North Korean colonel.
Four things I did not like. First, it was very dark. We actually see Bond being tortured. Also, we see blood. I can't recall another Bond film with blood being shown. Usually there is a suggestion of blood and torture off screen. Second, the theme song by Madonna. It was just awful. More like screeching than singing. Third, with all the references to previous Bond films, I think the producers, writers, etc. are taking themselves way too seriously. Fourth, it was about 10 minutes too long.
What I did like were the episodes in Hong Kong and Cuba, they were the film's best. Also, the sword fight was very enjoyable.
In the pantheon of Bond films I'd rate it about average. Not as good as ""From Russia With Love"" or ""Goldfinger"" better than ""Octopussy"" or ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" It is worth seeing.",1038700800,2,1368,4.565040650406504
1454078,2,B00005JLBE,"I, like many other reviewers here, have been a James Bond fan since I was a kid.  I remember seeing Thunderball the first time and loving it.  Over the years, I have been disappointed by some of the actors chosen to play 007 (Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton, specifically) but really like Pierce Brosnan in the role.
With that said, I was completely depressed by Die Another Day.  Where should I start?  Well, the cheesy sexual innuendos every scene is a good place to start.  Whenever Bond was within 3 feet of a woman, he had to drop some lame reference to sex - that, by the way, was telegraphed by the setup of the scene - which the female actors were obliged to respond to with their own cheesy reply.
This has always been part of the Bond dialogue, but Sean Connery did not run the routine into the ground.
Next, there is the whole element of using the most elaborate, technological tool for the simplest thing.  For instance, when 007 is brought back from his imprisonment in Korea, he is hospitalized and scanned with a pseudo-laser body scanner while lying on a standard hospital table.  The most advanced hospital in the world doesn't have this kind of technology.  Why even use it here?  And instead of parachuting into Korea, Bond and Jinx fly out of a cargo plane on little mini-aircraft, THEN parachute off of those to the ground.  All with the explanation that the little planes would not be picked up by radar.  Huh? And Q gives James a ring that can be turned into a sonic disruptor that will break glass.  Why would that be something that you need on any normal mission, where stealth would tend to be the way to go?  Exploding glass might sound some kind of alarm.  Oh wait - the sonic disruptor might be useful if your car is covered in water and you want to pull someone through the windshield.  Q must be quite the visionary.
Finally (at least for my review) there were times that you did not have to just suspend disbelief, but you had completely turn off your logic circuits and accept the idiotic situation on the screen.  A villain, injured in an explosion of a case full of diamonds is seen 14 months later with the diamonds still embedded in his skin, twinkling like pixie dust.  Hmmmm - seems like a pair of tweezers and some alchohol might have been the answer to that little dilemma.
And Bond cuts his way through a frozen lake, swims in frigid water to a hot spring, and is no worse for wear.  Or the same situation later in the movie where he and Jinx have been soaked to the bone with ice water but the result is that she is saved by the fact that it was so cold, while he is just fine, thank you very much.
Or the cargo plane that depressurizes, flys through a gigantic sun-powered laser, catches fire, falls to pieces for several minutes, but remains aloft long enough for James and Jinx to start a conveyor that dumps expensive sports cars from the plane so that they can get to the helicopter which can magically fall from the disentegrating plane and be started just feet from the ground to save our heroes.  (And don't even get me started on the final resting place of those sports cars.  Physics obviously has no place in this Bond film.)
The movie was not totally bad.  I liked the tough Jinx, the John Cleese take on Q, Mirand Frost and Moneypenny.  Otherwise, this was a mind-numbing waste of time.  I tried to enjoy it as pure entertainment, but could not even do that.  It probably did not help that I had just seen From Russia With Love a week or so ago.  James, how far you have fallen.",1038700800,7,3533,4.398461538461539
1454079,3,B00005JLBE,"All the ingredients for a Bond film are here: a snappy theme song done by a popular pop artist; a megalomaniac intent on throwing the world into chaos for his own ends; the villain's ""deformed"" yet lethal sidekick; the lair to end all lairs; the impossible-to-escape-from situations with which Bond finds himself; the one-of-a-kind gadgets at Bond's disposal; enough holes in the plot to drive an invisible Aston Martin through; and the finer-than-anything-else-on-the-planet women.

And for all her ""kick-butt"" attitude and ingenuity, ""Jinx"" (Halle Berry) ends up being rescued by James (Brosnan) no less than two times. She's still basically two-thirds liberated and one-third ""damsel in distress"".
But, it is a way to pass a wintry afternoon, just suspend belief for about two hours, as one does in all Bond flicks. This one, like most of the latter-day Bonds, is geared more for the adolescent male than those of the Connery/early Moore era, however.
Computer-generated effects, for all their advancement, still look like the fakery that they really are. The scene of Bond ""surfing"", like most of the film's ""big"" effects scenes, is so obviously done by computer that it is almost laughable.

1454153,5,B00005JLBE,"James Bond aficionados will be delighted to hear that 007 is not only back, but with renewed vigor, a great new villain who wants to dominate the world (surprise!), lots of gadgets, girls and Action! a-plenty, in ""Die Another Day,"" directed by Lee Tamahori.  Pierce Brosnan suits up for the fourth time as Secret Agent Man, joined this time around by a lady named Jinx (Halle Berry), who is not only beautiful but demonstrates early on that she can definitely take care of herself; a decidedly capable match for Mr. James Bond.  But whose side is she on, anyway?
The film opens with 007 insinuating himself into an operation transpiring in North Korea, where a certain Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is attempting to negotiate a deal to buy South African diamonds in exchange for weapons.  Our man Bond, of course, has replaced the contact and holds the briefcase containing the loot.  As expected, the enterprise quickly deteriorates into an explosive situation, and from that point on the action never stops.
Working from a story and screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also teamed for 1999's ""The World Is Not Enough,"" along with Bruce Feirstein), director Tamahori digs deep into the All-Things-Bond box to make this James Bond film...well... everything a James Bond film should be, from the fast paced action (it goes without saying) to the snappy repartee rife with bons mots and double-entendre (at which Berry/Jinx also proves to be a match for Brosnan/Bond) to one of the best ""henchmen"" (Zao, played terrifically by Rick Yun) since Goldfinger's Oddjob.  There is also a touch of nostalgia thrown in for good measure:  As Q (John Cleese) gives his dissertation on the latest gadgets, Bond casually ferrets through the Quartermaster's cache and comes across the lethal shoe that once belonged to Rosa Klebb, as well as a signature item from ""Thunderball.""  It's a nice touch that perhaps for the first time tangibly links forty years of ""Bond"" history together and goes far in dispelling the quite noticeable changing incarnations of 007 over the years; finally, rather than naturally, if subconsciously, categorizing the character into a Connery/Bond, Moore/Bond, Lazenby/Bond, Dalton/Bond or Brosnan/Bond, he's just ""Bond.""  James Bond.
Visually, this one has a lot to offer, with some extravagant sets, a memorable sword fight and special F/X that are, for the most part, top notch.  There is one scene near the end (suffice to say involving a lot of water and some huge waves) in which the F/X seem to dip somewhat below par and actually take on an almost ""60s"" look (intentional, perhaps, as an homage that would be in keeping with the rest of the film's nod to ""Bond"" history?) but overall it's a quality production, and the cinematography (by David Tattersall, who also did ""Star Wars, Episodes I & II"") is brilliant.
If ever an actor was meant to play a specific role, it's Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  From his initial outing as 007 (in 1995's ""GoldenEye"") he's been a perfect fit, but here he seems to have at last actually settled into the part and made it his own, in a way that Moore, Lazenby and Dalton (for all the individual and unique strengths they brought to their respective portrayals of Bond) were, even at their best, never able to achieve.  Brosnan credibly brings Ian Fleming's unflappable, stalwart hero to life with seemingly effortless aplomb, striking a chord in which the seriousness and the levity that defines the character mesh perfectly (Moore, on the other hand, played up the lightness too often, almost into parody at times; Dalton was altogether too serious; Lazenby was simply an anomaly).  Simply put, Brosnan has all of the qualities that personify James Bond, and he uses them all to the utmost effectiveness.
Following up her Oscar winning portrayal of Leticia Musgrove in 2001's ""Monster's Ball,"" Halle Berry, meanwhile, makes her mark as arguably one of the finest ""Bond Girls"" since Honor Blackman's performance as ""Ms."" Galore in ""Goldfinger"" in 1964.  She definitely makes one of the most memorable first entrances from among the rank and file of the Bond Beauties; emerging from the sea in an orange two-piece suit she looks absolutely stunning, calling to mind Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in 1962's ""Dr. No.""  Pulchritude aside, however, Berry most importantly makes her character believable, which in no small part lends the necessary support to the anticipated outlandishness of the fiction.
The one female in a recurring role who has yet to be given her due as a ""Bond Girl,"" is a consummate actor who has added significantly to the Bond legacy with her portrayal of ""M.""  Dame Judi Dench came on board along with Brosnan in ""GoldenEye,"" empowering women everywhere by taking on a highly visible role of absolute authority, albeit fictional, and helping to revitalize the ""Bond"" series.  Casting her as Bond's superior was a stroke of genius, and the way Dench took over the role and made it her own should at last be acknowledged.  She is, without question, a big part of the renewed strength of the ""Bond"" of the new millennium.
Making her motion picture debut here, Rosamund Pike also adds her name to the roster as Miranda Frost, but though she adds beauty and poise to the film, she is less than charismatic and her performance lacks the kind of spunk that would have made her character more than just adequate.  Still, it would be hard for any actor to get a toehold playing against the radiant Halle Berry, and on a positive note, Pike does lend a decided elegance to the role.
As Bond's nemesis, Gustav Graves, Toby Stephens gives an energetic performance and carves out a niche for himself in the annals of Bond bad guys; and with a physical oddity sustained in the opening sequence of the film, Yune makes a lasting impression as Zao.  In the final analysis, ""Die Another Day"" is the best ""Brosnan"" Bond yet.",1038441600,6,5891,4.884769539078157
1454154,3,B00005JLBE,"For my birthday I went to see D*A*D (Die Another Day). It was the best James Bond movie there is but it isn't the worst. The move has a really good script but lacks the quallity of a GOOD James Bond movie. The special affects are really good. Especially with the into music/video. But what is most irrating is how when there is a good action sequence going they slow down the movie, (sorta like in the movie The Matrix). Mainly I rated the movie 3 stars was because it wasn't a James Bond movie. It was more of and action flick with guns, cars, and women. Which I grant you all the past James Bond movies had but this one really doesn't have that Bond feel. It is too much like Moonraker, too futuristic. I think the reason for this is because of the other spy movies coming out. But none the less if you are a dedicated James Bond fan you should go to see the movie; even though you may be slightly disappointed.",1038355200,3,913,4.193181818181818

1454156,5,B00005JLBE,"First, I have to say that I'm huge James Bond Fan, I've seen probably the entire series. In addition, I have to say that this one is probably the best one. The plot is very simple, but I did not expect anything else. This was meant to be a pure fun and nothing else. What I really liked is the human element Brosnan brought into his James Bond movies.  In the last movie, he dislocated his arm, this time he was captured and tortured in prison. This makes him look more real, someone who can really be in danger, someone you can root for. Along with Sean Connery, he IS the BEST James Bond actor. John Cleese's is also great as new Q.
All the women characters acted very well in this movie.  I personally liked most the Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) character, incredibly sexy and cheeky. Halle is also very entertaining.  And the Moneypenny scene ... GREAT :-).
I liked the dialogs in the movie, one joke after another one.
All in all a 100% pure fun; cheeky and very very entertaining.",1038355200,2,987,4.382513661202186
1454157,4,B00005JLBE,"In some ways, DIE ANOTHER DAY is the best Bond movie ever. I mean, after the action-packed opening scene through the 49th Parrellel in Korea; James Bond is captured by the North Koreans and sent to type of POW camp. The plot remains fairly tight (considering this is a Bond picture), there are all sorts of new gadgets (and glimpses of ones from the past), lots of witty one-liners and double entredes, great action, and two stunningly-beautiful babes. The movie constantly play on the Bond-format, but does so in such a way that it shakes things up and makes the franchise seem more alive and current.

Nevertheless, with all it has going for it, there is one major flaw to the film. James Bond movies used to be fairly believable (see the first two Bond movies), but it seems that as each new film is made, the creators see just how far they can go to push the believability button. There aren't a lot of things in this movie that question one's suspension of disbelief. However, there are a few and they are so huge that it counters all the good things this film has going for it. For instance, the plane/helicopter escape at the film's climax. I felt like I was watching a bad sci-fi movie when that scene happened. There could have been several other more crafty ways to have Bond escape, but instead they went for the most extreme. Other than that, DIE ANOTHER DAY is one heck of a good James Bond adventure",1038268800,,1413,4.498054474708171
1454158,4,B00005JLBE,"I have seen every James Bond movie at least 3 times....that makes a total of about 57 viewings. I like to think of myself as a pretty die-hard Bond fan. I loved the Austin Powers series because of all the inside jokes that the films made at the Bond series. Inside jokes that only Bond fans would understand. I had always hoped that MGM would produce a Bond film that seemed to be geared strictly towards its loyal and devoted Bondaholics, like myself, and with ""Die Another Day"" I feel that said film has been made. Bond has been around for 20 films, and over 40 years! That's unbelievable. Bond has seen quite a few changes throughout the 60's, 70's, 80's (shudder), 90's and now the 'oughts'(as I like to call them). It is good to see that Bond has made the transition to the 21st smoothly...or shaken, but not stirred. The new Bond flick begins in a way that none other have...he gets caught during the opening sequence! That satisfies all of those old 'well what if he got caught?' thoughts that the Bond fans often get at 3 o'clock in the morning. I must say that it is quite refreshing to see a more laid back and vulenerable Bond character. I also love the idea that the Bond girl is just as smart as she is sexy. A brainy Bond girl is so much sexier, and no one on this earth would have been able to pull off the role of Jinx like the ravishing Halle Berry did. Anyway...the film is filled with fantasticly cheesy one liners that only die-hard Bond fans could enjoy, and Q has the best line in the film by making a quip about how many watches Bond has had over the years. The film itself is truly one of the better Bond films to come out within the last 20 years or so. Loaded with Bond inside jokes, action, cool gadgets, smart & sexy Bond girls, and a scene stealing sword fight, ""Die Another Day"" is a true winner. Bond fans will not be disappointed. Thansk MGM for making a true 'Bond fan' Bond movie. Here's hoping that Pierce sticks around for awhile...and how about making a Jinx spinoff movie?",1038268800,2,2010,4.334217506631299

This is the first bond film ever made completly off scene. which means It was all made in hollywood and man can you tell! The movie lacks the good old fashon bond feel. it doesn't feel like the good old adventure bond used to go on, the movie doesn't take you anywhere and is only loaded with numerous sexual references (more so than any other bond film and they are very chessy). The only thing this movie has to offer is a bunch of explosions. SAVE YOUR MONEY and rent an OLD BOND MOVIE.",1038268800,18,653,4.030769230769231
1454161,4,B00005JLBE,"This is the 20th Bond film, so you know the producers have a rough time trying to keep it fresh.  DAD still packs some fun and zip, but some compromises were made along the way.
The opening credits/song sequence plays like a music video.  And title song, co-written and sung by Madonna, just isn't very good.  It seems out of place compared to previous Bond title songs.  It tries too hard to be techno/trendy/hip, and just doesn't work.  And Madonna herself appears in the film (briefly, thank goodness), looking every day of her 40+ years of age.
That said, some of the setpieces are spectacular and refreshingly creative.  The hovercraft chase at the beginning, a nasty fight with broadswords soon after, and an implausibile but fun car chase on ice towards the end are visual and adrenaline-pumping treats.  You are gonna LOVE those cars!  Very drool-worthy!  But an invisible Aston Martin?  C'mon. Please.
Halle Berry:  Looks great in a bikini in one scene.  Looks very lovely in close-ups with her perfect white teeth.  But she looks like a neophyte spy running around with a gun.  Not distractingly bad, but could have been much better.
Actor Toby Stephens plays the primary villain, and he is delightfully evil in the mold of some previous Bond heavies.  He is ridiculously rich and arrogant as hell.  But then again, so is Bond.
British actress Rosamund Pike plays Miranda Frost, employee of the villain and lust target for Bond.  She is what a classic Bond Girl should be -- beautiful, smart, sexy, and played by a relatively unknown actress.
Director Lee Tamahori keeps the action going at a fairly rapid clip, though his use of Matrix-style slo-mo shots seem random and useless sometimes.  But as a viewer I couldn't help thinking that this is just another Bond film where the franchise's age is compensated for with bigger and louder explosions and more outrageously fantastic gadgets.  Visual overload.
Remember 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only""?  In that Bond film the producers decided to step back a bit from the outrageousness and gadgetry and just make an out-and-out action thriller.  It worked great, and stands as one of the best Bond films ever.  So we don't need to have invisible cars, death rays from orbiting satellites, or lots of explosions and destruction to make a really good spy yarn.
""Die Another Day"" pushes the envelope about as far as it can go before reaching complete self-parody.  I long for a return to a ""FYEO""-type Bond film.
Best part about this film?  No Denise Richards.",1038268800,6,2510,4.838028169014085
1454230,5,B00005JLBE,"This movie is fantastic! In fact it's one of the best 'James Bond' movies yet! It has great hi-tech weapons, new femme fatales, a new mission, but the same James Bond. It's the edgiest James Bond movie yet. This flick features some fantastic action sequences. The movie is a brilliant feature. It's definitely the best from Pierce Brosnan's Bond movies. It's kind of long though but has some fantastic stunts. My favorite stunt was when he skis down a glacier as a laser beam from outer space melts the glacier. It's knocked Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets off the top spot and it's one of the best action flicks this year.this movie is still a must-see for action flick fanatics! It's visually trendy and is one of the most compelling action flicks. It's James Bond so if you haven't guessed yet, it has; the action, the weaponry, the romance, and a little bit of comedy too (just like any other James Bond flick).

  The movie starts out with a hovercraft chase through a region separating North and South Korea. This time his (Pierce Brosnan) mission is to trace a traitor and prevent a combat of catastrophic proportions. He then encounters Jinx (Halle Berry). And then lets not forget Miranda Frost. Both play an essential role in James Bond's mission. He then seeks 'Graves' and 'Zao', two villains in this quest. And consequently he goes to Iceland to Graves' 'hideout'. The hideout is pretty cool. It's a palace built entirely of ice. There he finds a new deadly hi-tech weapon. Although he goes to Hong Kong- Cuba and London too, he has to go back to Korea (where the mission began- kind of like a Tomb Raider game)!

Overall it was a great film! I really enjoyed it. If it isn't obvious, it isn't really a movie for those of you looking for a good comedy too watch. If you're looking for a comedy check out 'My big fat Greek wedding' or just wait for next year's flicks ). But if you want to watch a great action flick, I would recommend no other.

Overlong, overbaked, ridiculous, insulting, stupefying, garbage.  The dialog is so bad I thought I would cry.  The humor is infantile - not witty - just crude and boorish.  The worst Bond song ever courtesy of Madonna ....  Why is a guy wearing a Nintendo game glove that shocks people exciting?  Where did he get it? Why?

1454232,4,B00005JLBE,"Really a 4 and a half. I saw this movie on Friday, when it came out. I won't go throught the pleasentries (the plot points), and I definitely don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just give out the characters and a small background.
 James Bond- If you don't know, then you don't deserve to know. Jinx- Played to perfection by Halle Berry, she is the female equivalent to James Bond (except she's American), sacrificing brawn for sexiness. Miranda Frost- MI6 agent. Proper, beautiful, and supposedly wants nothing to do with Bond. Gustave Graves- Millionaire with own diamond company and mine in Iceland. Past shrouded in mystery. Zao- All-around bad guy from North Korea. Bond gave him ""expensive acne"".
 This movie starts out with an explosive beginning, with the suaveness thats been missing since the days of Connery (but has almost been reached by Brosnans Goldeneye). The usual jokes are there, but the beginning has a twist new to the Bond series. I especially like how you could see what was happening to Bond during the song and credits in the beggining.
 From there, you get a great, fast paced action movie, with a lot of in-jokes that even casual Bond fans will enjoy. The car is the best since Goldfinger (they finally returned to their roots and used an Aston Martin-the exquisite V12 Vanquish). They push the plot along nicely, and all the scenes are pumped with action and jokes.
 The end becomes a little too much (I felt it could have done with a toning down), but luckily it doesn't ruin the movie. One joke involving Moneypenny at the end is simply halarious.
 All in all, this is a top-notch Bond flick, and deserves at least one viewing. The jokes are great, the gagdets are great, the girls are great, the action is great. Its all great.

With great special effects, great action sequences, and fighting sequences.  Halle Berry might have been a bit to strong, but her character fit this movie perfect.  Th people who put this down were correct in that it's not believable, but HEY,  this is JAMES BOND 007.  Even in the olden days Bond wasn't believable.  Just because what Bond did in the old movies is believable now, does mean that Bond has to get more advanced.  Anyone who says that this was a waist of money, is totally wrong.

But, somewhere around 007s arrival in Iceland the movie seems to lose both focus and intelligence and what we are left with is the feeling of a movie with a definite split personality. A great beginning and a terrible, boring conclusion.
The writers also seem to be devoid of new ideas blatently copying ideas from previous entries. They called them 'homages"" but I don't buy it. It's clear that Purvis and Wade are tired with 007 and just wanted a paint by numbers Bond movie to churn out.

I really enjoyed this. It dips into the classic bond yet looks to the future as well. There are things for rookie bond fans and for those of us who pride ourselves on seeing them all.
Halle Berry (and Character 'jinx') went above and beyond my expectations. And the chemistry between her and Bond sizzles. And is noticeable from their first ten minutes together on screen. It really shows how far the Bond girl has come in 40 years. From damsel in distres to able bodied partner. Is it just me or did anyone else think that a character as tough as Jinx deserve more than a ""Ford"". That car is ugly anyways.
I loved the whole Zao Character. He just fit so well in a Bond movie. Other than that he just looked really cool. Especially when driving the Jag. I was even more impressed with the performance by Rosemund Pike's character 'Miranda Frost'. Or was I simply impressed with Rosemund Pike? I don't know Im getting ahead of myself. I loved her character. And the inevitable plot twist she brought with her. (but my lips are sealed)
Pierce? Well, what can I say. Second best Bond only to Sean Connery (and let's face it those are some big shoes to fill) He just fits the part so well. And is capable of keeping you paying attention to everything thats going on. that is if the plot doesn't already.
Over all This movie served as mouthwash to refresh the bad taste in my mouth from where 'The world is not enough' left off. But like I said if there is a bad bond film, i have yet to see it, and I've seen all 20.",1038182400,2,1672,4.311111111111111
1454236,5,B00005JLBE,"DIE ANOTHER DAY was in a word terrific.  While it probably won't win any oscars or awards, on a level of movies that this one rests on, it is terrific.
Bond movies were begining to be a little stagnant.  Not that all of the Bond movies don't follow the same formula...there was not one scene that I couldn't see coming in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and hardly one line that I found remotely funny, and was thus very bored.  THANKFULLY, for all of us Bond fans, DIE ANOTHER DAY succeeds brilliantly in injecting some surprise, great action, and even some new directing back into the francise.  It's also good to see that the sprawling 60's style production of big futuristic sets have returned to the series not to mention Bond's newest rolling arsenal of destruction, the Aston Martin Vanquish is here to give those Beemer's the boot.
DIE ANOTHER DAY's story has Bond getting into North Korea to assassinate a General, while he succeeds he is shortly captured and subjected to torture!  For the next 14 months!!  Released via prisoner exchange, M tells Bond that she has lost her faith in him and leaves him to rot in a Hospital while he is rehabilitating.  Bond breaks free and goes from Cuba learning of a DNA experiment on the prisoner who he was excahnged for, and following a clue going to Iceland to see a billionaire demonstrate his new satelite, which secretly could be used for mass destruction via solar rays.  Are the two men connected?  Bond thinks so (so yes of course they are) and while working (or when they bump into each other) with a woman named Jinx who may or may not have her own agenda, the two must work to stop the mad pair.
Not to sound trite, but I was glued to the screen.  There was hardly a moment that I didn't like save for two occasions.  Ice queen Miranda Frost (a contender for worst Bond girl with Britt Ekland in the annoying dept,) Is 100% pouty and has NO life, an allusion to her name being Frost maybe. The second is Maddona's theme song.  I actually kinda like some of Maddona's more recent work, but this one was poppy and obnoxious.  (Look for Maddona in the movie as a fencing coach.)
The humor, well this could also be the funniest Bond movie.  John Cleese is the only person imaginable to replace Q and he gets away with most of the best lines.  The double entandres are as abundant as ever and you actually don't groan at all of them.  Miss Moneypenny's little stunt near the end of the movie, is a near laugh riot.
Over the top in a few places, yes but I didn't care at all.  DIE ANOTHER DAY is excellant and ranks right up near the top for favorite Bond film.

Now don't get me wrong this movie has everything James Bond fans love action, adventure, Outragous stunt, cool cars and Bond Girls.  But it stays away from a lot of the one liners(they are still there, but there are less of them).  The story is better, then the average Bond plot.  It actually makes you think.  And in this movie Pierce Brosnan finally takes the role over and makes it his own.  He is the best Bond since Connery, by far.  All that makes it a good James Bond Movie but what puts it over the top is two little words....Halle Berry, she is by far the sexiest woman to be in a Bond movie since Ursula Andress and the woman in From Russia With Love.  Plus she is also the first real quality actress to play a Bond Girl, Judi Dench not included since she plays M.

1454239,5,B00005JLBE,"I just saw the film 2 days ago and I think its excellent, both from an average movie viewer perspective and from a Bond fan perspective. Reading the other reviews, I get the feeling that many of the poor reviews are from older viewers who are used to the 60s Bonds and simply aren't up to date. I didn't find it very hard to keep up with the plot (there WAS a plot, contrary to some other feedback). The films villains are excellent, very memorable. I'll remember Gustav Graves and Miranda Frost as easily as any of the other top notch villians of the past.
I also found the new direction of the Bond character as a refreshingly welcome note. The classic Bond was good, good enough to fuel nearly 20 films, but it wouldn't last forever. For the series to continue, Bond needs to evolve a bit, and I think this film is the perfect first step. Dr. No, Goldfinger, etc are their own films, I certainly don't want to see the same film with different characters and the same plot. A lot of the negative reviews are from older viewers who want to relish the 60s Bond. Thats fine, but keep in mind that its not the 60s. Many of us want to see 21st century bond, there're plenty of excellent 60S films to look back on, no need to make more now. Its 50 years too late.",1038096000,,1259,4.25
1454350,5,B00005JLBE,"This is a fun movie, filled with nonstop action and special effects and I enjoyed it tremendously. It is lighthearted fantasy entertainment. Without a doubt in my opinion it is by far the best of the current generation of Bond movies since the use of computer enhanced special effects has come into general practice. I think it is meaningless to try to compare it with the early movies based on Ian Fleming stories meant to involve serious spycraft; if those are your type of film , you can skip this one.
I loved the new weapons even if totally unbelievable and the new toys and gadgets for Bond (especially the car). This is a different and very enjoyable Pierce Brosnan making his debut both as a surfer and later as an unkempt POW (if you liked Remington Steele you can always watch THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR instead). With Halle Berry as his equal and Judi Dench and John Cleese completing the cast of good guys, they become a very formidable even if apparently overmatched team. Bond is betrayed while attempting to complete a mission in North Korea ( apparently a true axis of evil country as President Bush claims), and the most graphic and realistic horror scenes take place while is he tortured following his capture. The action then moves to Cuba and the Caribbean, followed by England, Iceland and back to Korea for the grand finale.
In order of appearance, my favorite scenes were 1)the Hovercraft battle, 2)the wonderful swordfight full of great stunts in the staid London men's club, 3) the windsurfing scene dodging artic ice floes, 4) the final car chase and 5) the grand finale aboard a disabled airplane where an impossible escape was accomplished just as the plane disintegrated. All these were of course totally unrealistic but nevertheless fantastically entertaining. I hope they give you some idea for the range of action and the nature of the story.
So if you just want to relax and enjoy a fun film, see this. You know the good guys will win, the bad guys will die despite their apparent superiority, and Pierce and Halle will have a great time together when they are not just trying to stay alive.",1038096000,4,2121,4.704301075268817
1454351,5,B00005JLBE,"""Die Another Day"" is a very different James Bond movie.  To many, this is a godsend.  I personally have enjoyed the entire series.  I find each movie to have its own merits, but, of course, I have my favorites.  This, I would say, is one of them.  I would have to admit that this is the best Pierce Brosnan movie yet.  It beats most of Roger Moore's movies save ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""For Your Eyes Only.""  It would rank close to a few of Sean Connery's movies.  I know that what I said is sacrilege, but let me clarify.  I personally do not like ""Diamonds are Forever"", it has a very different tone from the rest of the Connery Bonds.  It is slow starting and the audience is left wondering when the movie is going to start half-way through the movie.  Besides it has the gayest (no pun intended) henchmen of any Bond movie.  I like ""You Only Live Twice"" but it just doesn't seem to have the character of the first 4 films.  I believe if I were to choose my 4 favorite Bond films of all time, they would be ""Thunderball"", ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""  ""Die Another Day"" would rank as the 5th.  Here is why: ""Die Another Day"" depicts James Bond as a vulnerable human being.  The tendancy for the last 10 Bond movies except ""License to Kill"" is to make Bond a god-figure.  Bond is in peril and we have no clue as to what will happen next.  How will or Will Bond escape this one?  This movie felt a lot more down to earth, almost as if it could have actually happened.  Almost is a key word though.  That one special-effects scene (you all know the one that I am talking about) was so dumb.  Because of this, I want to rate this movie as a 4.75.  It really detracted from what the movie had going for it.  I loved all the cameos, though.
This movie is definitely worth seeing.  I would have to say this is the best movie since Bond #12.",1038096000,2,1884,4.2100840336134455
1454352,1,B00005JLBE,"I am a huge James Bond Fan and I think Pierce Brosnan is the Best Bond (since Sean Connery). I just came back from seeing DAD and I totally agree with Marc H. from Napa and the reviewer fron UK. This movie ...... This is NOT a James Bond movie. For those of you who think it will become a classic, think again. GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, LIVE AND LET DIE, GOLDENEYE are all classic Bond movies. All this hoopla about a new Bond for the millennium is complete bull. If that's the direction that the Bond franchise is going, I'm soory to say it will lose a lot of devoted fans, me included.  Halle Berry is a very talented actress, but she is completely wasted in this overblown CG festival without a (decent) plot. I think this is a good movie for 13 year olds who love extreme sports on ESPN and computer games. I have been a fan since the first James Bond, and I was looking forward to see the 20th and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the best secret agent ever. Instead, I went to a stupid and over-the-top circus that takes away all the excitement and magic of a James Bond movie. IT WAS JUST WAY TOO MUCH. What a letdown. Makes you appreciate a movie like XXX. Too bad.",1038096000,14,1173,4.260089686098655
1454353,4,B00005JLBE,"I have no choice but to rate this movie as four stars. There is so much that the filmmakers got right, it overshadows what they got wrong. But wrong there still is.
As for right, the villains are the best since ""Goldeneye"". They have the typically Bondian quirks that make them stand out above your average villain (one has diamonds imbedded in his face, while another is incapable of sleeping). John Cleese is a respectful replacement for the late lamented Q (there's a nice tip of the hat to Connery's Bond during the scene in Q's workshop). Both M and Moneypenny are in fine form as their respective characters. The villains have an interesting ice palace lair, and Bond has a new car and some neat new gadgets. Great action and stunts are par for the course. And the ladies are worthy of being Bond girls, too.
As for wrong, there is just no way our hero James Bond would be stuck in a North Korean prison for fourteen months. Fourteen days, maybe. Fourteen months? No way. And was it really necessary that he be there that long? Surely, Bond would have more than enough reason to seek revenge in a much shorter period of time. Further, Bond would never be seen as so expendable to Her Majesty's Secret Service.
The ""Matrix""-inspired camera moves (rapidly zipping in on a scene, then jamming into slow-motion speed), also does not fit the Bond mold.
The scene where Halle Berry comes out of the surf a la Ursula Andress in the classic ""Dr. NO"" (complete with a knife at her side), simply screams of a lack of originality. And then there's Brosnan. As much as I like the actor, he's starting to look just a wee bit past it here to be playing Mr. Bond. Throughout the picture, I couldn't help constantly thinking of Roger Moore towards the end of his run as 007; just a bit past believability, but a fan favorite still game to play Bond.
And the theme song is nice techno pop, but is it worthy of Bond? I think not. First, Sheryl Crow (TWINE), now Madonna. I liked a-ha's ""The Living Daylights"" and Duran Duran's ""View to a Kill"" as stand-alone songs, but they were not right for Bond any more than Crow or Madonna. While I recognize the need to have popular and marketable artists singing the movie themes for tie-in sales, I don't think either of these two qualify as Bond singers. We need the torchy singers back, like Shirley Bassy, Tom Jones, Nancy Sinatra, Tina Turner, or Carly Simon. There's a certain quality to the songs and artists that is missing here. Bond music isn't, and shouldn't be, techno. The new Madonna song is great, just not right for a Bond picture. Letting someone like Eminem do the next theme is unthinkable, but st this point I wouldn't be surprised if they inflicted it on us.
I admit, I am a Bond purist. I think that Bond should still sport his cigarette case, not so he smokes, as much as it makes a good prop for Q to put gadgets in. I think there is no need to try and make Bond ""real"" for the real world. Sure, being captured and tortured by the bad guys is the reality that real secret agents may face, but not Bond! Bond is smarter, luckier, better than the average spy. Bond is who men wish they were, not someone who goes ""boo, hoo"" when he has to kill someone.
Any aging franchise needs a bit of updating from time to time, but with Bond, that updating is more often than not in the form of a new actor in the Bond role. A new actor brings his own style to the character, giving Bond all the updating that may be required. The argument that trendy rock or pop singers or 'hip' ""Matrix"" camera work is required to make a Bond movie marketable with today's moviegoing public just doesn't wash.
Overall, ""Die Another Day"" worth a view. Of course it is. As an action film, it's awesome. As a Bond film, there's just enough of the old Bond magic hiding beneath the modernized elements to still be enjoyable.
Better than ""Octopussy""? You bet! But the best Bond ever?

1454356,5,B00005JLBE,"James Bond is back in the studios twentieth feature film.  Pierce Brosnan and Die Another Day is, in this viewer's opinion, certainly a lot better than the last Bond film.  The Premise:  As with all Bond films, Die Another Day starts off with a huge action sequence, setting up the rest of what the film is about.  James Bond infiltrates his way into North Korea, in certainly what can be described as a most unusual way.  He's there to assassinate a North Korean Army Colonel who's selling weapons on the black market.  His cover is blown and yet, through some pretty amazing action sequences, he seemingly accomplishes his mission.  In doing so though, he's captured by the North Korean Army and in particular, the father of the Colonel he's seemingly assassinated.
What follows after James Bond's capture in North Korea, is one absolutely great Bond movie, which harkens back to some of the earlier Bond movies.  There's even a sequence with Q, showing off a lot of the old gadgets that previous Bond films featured.  Halle Berry's performance is in par with her fine acting skills.  She doesn't just come off as another Bond babe in this film, her performance, lines and action sequences put her right up there with James Bond himself.  I hope the persisting rumors about a spin off with her as the lead character ring true.
Overall a great Bond flick that I would recommend to anybody.  If you're one of those that were put off by the last one or two Bond films and are skeptical about this one, it's okay to come back to the theater and give this genre a new look now.",1038096000,3,1574,4.582142857142857

1454359,3,B00005JLBE,"Even though I have seen all of the 007 films I have never been a huge fan of them. Most of them definately hold one's interest and then there are some that are a little drawn out. Now comes Die Another Day. When I saw the previews for this movie it gave me a little bit of hype, but after seeing the movie I am reminded of the typical 007 storylines. James Bond has to stop some terrorist from taking over the world, he sleeps with every woman he comes in contact with, he always has a new car due to destroying the car he had in the previous film, and he never loses in hand-to-hand combat or gets injured for that matter. Basically,everything seems to work out for the 00 agent. I will admit that most every bond film has been in some way more creative than the previous but if you look at all of the 007 movies you will find that they pretty much have very similar plots. After 40 years of James Bond you would think that his character would be considered to be an ""outdated dinosaur"" but I guess the general public just can't get enough of 007. As for me, I hope that a very unusual plot twist will take place in the next 007 movie.",1038009600,,1136,4.121621621621622

1454439,5,B00005JLBE,"The 20th and most fantastic movie to enter the series in a long time! Packed with evil villians, sexy girls, gadgets galore and the classic one-liners from the most famous spy of all time- it doesn't get any better than that. First the villians- Gustav Graves is a snotty, arrogant and show-off to the public and is bent on world domination with his super weapon- the Icarus. He duels 007 with fencing swords and lives in style in his Ice palace in Iceland. Zao is the henchmen who is scarred with diamond shrapnel and has a personal goal to kill 007. And, finally is my favorite character in the movie- the stunning Miranda Frost! She is the athletic, cunning, mysterious, extremely sexy ice princess that gives Bond the ice treatment in her regard to her extreme hate of him. a world-class fencer, and collaborator with Gustav, she battles with Jinx aboard the Antonov plane, and ultimately meets her end. (Darn!, I really liked her, She really is hot!) The other main Bond girl is Jinx, who works as a team with Bond, and battles along with him. David Arnold gives his finest perfromance, with his best 007 soundtrack ever! Madonna gives the most different, but one of the best title songs ever also.
This film has many references to the past because of the 40th anniversary of the films. Here are a few---
-look for 007 holding the book Birds Of The West Indies by James Bond.
-007 steals a grape a la` Thunderball
-the WWII cigarettes poster that Domino loved from Thunderball
-Duke of Wellington statue in teaser a la` like the picture in Dr. No
-fencing club called Blades, like the gentlemen's club in many 007 books
-Jinx entry like Honey Ryder in Dr. No
-MANY past gadgets in Q's lab from past Bond films.
-Q's quip to 007, ""Here's your new watch, this will be your 20th I believe."" Ha Ha Ha.
Also be on the lookout for the classic cameo of Michael G. Wilson in the film as General Chandler. Madonna also does a cameo as fencing instructer Verity in the Blades Club.
A long awaited film, that I have had the pleasure of seeing, and GOD! it is one of the best in the series!!!",1038009600,17,2085,4.489473684210527
1454440,4,B00005JLBE,"After reading a string of reviews from people who had never seen Die Another Day (hey thanks!), I wanted to see it anyway. Who can say no to James Bond? Every Bond movie comes down to action, setting, girls, cars and gadgets, so we might as well rate it based on these.
Action: almost frantic, for 2 1/2 hours. Hovercraft chases, car chases, a riveting sword fight, gun fights in aircraft, gun fights in an ice palace, car gadget fights on ice, etc. -- you get the idea. If you liked Driving Miss Daisy, this isn't your flick. But Bond is Bond, and somehow it works. The action crowds out almost all character development, but I would recommend the old Ian Fleming books if you want to explore that side of the most famous secret agent.
Setting: Gritty North Korean military camps, Cuba and an especially arctic portrayal of Iceland. I always like to leave a Bond movie feeling like I've vacationed in a few spots. Die Another Day works. A gorgeous movie on the big screen.
Girls: Two love interests, Halle Berry being the more interesting interest. Nothing too risque in the sex scenes, so bring the kids if they're already accustomed to the violence. The dialogue is atrociously corny, one one-liner after another. Brosnan can get away with it. Berry won't be winning any awards for this. Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton were darker. Roger Moore was always rather flip. Brosnan seems to have edged toward the Bond-as-wiseacre in Die Another Day.
Cars: An A++. Was there ever anything better than an Aston Martin for 007? The gorgeous Vanquish (with invisibility, rockets, and the other options you won't find at your local Jag dealer...) is perfect Bond, updated. Berry's Thunderbird makes the briefest appearance, and gets upstaged by everything else. It felt like a commercial spot (shock!). Lots of Land Rovers, as Ford gets its money's worth, and a diabolocial Jaguar Racing Green XKR convertible with rocket launchers -- well, you get the idea. A tad high on the commercial aspect, but not ruinously so.
Gagdets -- John Cleese is wonderful as Q, even if the late Desmond Llewelyn will always be Q. I won't spoil it for you, but watch for some older Bond props. Bond's new ring, watch and the accessories on his Aston Martin are marvelous. You cringe knowing the car will never make through the film.
Overall, Bond fans will love this. Students of cinema won't. The plot isn't much, the dialogue often weak and the characters thin. The title song was vapid compared to almost any Bond title I can remember. It may be the worst one yet -- pop candy with a hint of rap. No reason to avoid modern artists, but this one doesn't work. David Arnold's score usually does, with many cues borrowed directly from The World is Not Enough (really a very good soundtrack) and even a snippet of 'London Calling', in case Bond ever listened to The Clash.
How can I not recommend James Bond? Leave reality behind for a couple of hours and have fun.",1038009600,12,2938,4.673745173745174
1454441,5,B00005JLBE,"Lee Tamahori should be the official Bond director. This movie had everything a Bond fan wants, action, sex, fast cars, etc. At first I was reluctant having stated that Roger Moore was my favorite Bond, but now has been bumped to two for Mr. Brosnan.

Special effects are wonderful and the stunts are very Bondesque. People have been told to watch out for things from old movies, just keep to the obvious, you don't want it to overshadow your pleasure in the greatest Bond film ever. John Cleese as the new Q is great!! The kiss with Moneypenny and Bond...hilarious.

More lasers, more bad guys, more women, more guns, more cars (best Bond car yet), more gadgets, more explosions and more Bond.  I was drooling from the sweetness of it.

1454444,5,B00005JLBE,"Each new movie to the James Bond saga seems to exceed its precedent release.  I won't waste time talking about the director's hard work and the amount of effort it took to take this movie to the big screen.  Quite simply, this one's something you don't want to miss.
Right from the start, the action kicks off with James infiltrating a North Korean military station.
Deception, betrayal, action and the will to survive will soar in this movie and help send it sky rocketing to the top of the charts in the weeks after its release.  As I've said, there is tons of action in this movie.  Examples such as swordfights, fistfights with deadly lasers zigzagging every which way, high explosive, armored car duels on and in the ice and a final bout in an exploding plane miles above the ground are just some of what you can expect to see in this movie.  The intro music video, featuring Madonna's ""Die another Day,"" is probably the best yet where the girls are literally HOTTER than they've ever been.  Don't forget the gadgets.  During the movie, James gets his hands on devices such as his traditional laser watch, a high-frequency ring and a BMW that features a camouflage mode.
After watching this, don't be surprised if you have the urge to buy a Norelco razor or a brand-new BMW(The advertising's everywhere, trust me.  And the soundtrack's not bad either).  Looking past this, however, you won't be disappointed in spending a couple of hours to go see this movie filled with suspense, action and witty remarks from the characters.  Bond fan or not, if you like action mixed with a great plot, this one's for you and I promise you won't regret it.",1038009600,2,1647,4.628865979381444
1454445,2,B00005JLBE,"With 19 other films under its belt I would of thought that the producers should of known better.
Rather than making this film a gritty character peice - as promised to the fans - they opt to create a film in which they give us a great story set up, which goes on to develop into the largest mix of cheesy set and action peices that I have seen since Moonraker - with the acception of Batman & Robin.
Computer graphics (poor ones at that) have now replaced creative stunt work, to give us overly elaborate and ultimatly boring action sequences, why don't they just brake down and make a CGI Bond movie?
The two stars that I give this film are for nostalgia reasons - and for that for the first hour I thought that I was in for a fun Bond experience.
The powers that be have forgotton that Bond fans hate Moonraker for a very good reason - I hope they realize their mistake, and redeliver.",1038009600,4,887,4.254437869822485
1454446,2,B00005JLBE,"I have been a Bond fan for a very long time. And out of the 20 films, I have seen 18. I have not seen the previous two films with Brosnan. But, I have never seen a Bond film I didn't like, that is until now.
 In just just this past year we have had our share of Bond imitators, ""XXX"", the popular ""Austin Powers"" film and ""Undercover Brother"". We have mostly pushed these films aside saying, yeah, maybe they're good, but, now we're going to see the way it SHOULD be done. Well, it looks the master is following the student. The James Bond films have alway had the same qualities that the title character has always had. They are suave movies, done with style. The Bond I remember was usually very slick. Now it's like Bond has been ""dumbed down"". The movie just doesn't hit the standard we have expected from the series.
 Another thing that bothered me was this idea to make Bond more modern. I remember in one movie they had him get married, in yet another they showed him cry, as started in ""Goldeneye"" his boss, ""M"" is now a womam. Probably a inside joke on his womanizing personality. But, I hate just about everything modern. And I hate when Hollywood gets one of it's of those ""brilliant"" ideas to make things modern. I don't want a modern James Bond. And in ""Die Another Day"" there are many ""first"". So, if your a true die-hard Bond fan, some of these things may offend you. Like for a quick example, remember the standard shot in the begining of all the Bond film when he shoots at the screen? Well, they've changed that. Now we see the bullet come at the screen. What a clever idea!!! I'm joking of course. What the heck was the point of that?!
 ""Die Another Day"" starts off with Bond in North Korea, in a diamond exchange for massive weapons. Then a big action sequence happens. And that leads to another problem. There are so many action scenes, that you have to ask yourself. What are they trying to prove here? They have managed to over-do everything in this film. But, anyway, Bond is captured and kept a prisoner for 14 months. And when released ""M"" (Judi Dench) informs Bond that there is a fear he is a traitor and was probably brainwashed.
 Now this all leads us back to those diamonds. And the diamonds lead Bond to a man named Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). When Bond and him do meet, socially of course. It causes one of the oddest scenes to ever take place in a Bond film. A fencing match that goes way over the top. It's so campy.
 I'm not going to go into much more of the story. Because there's probably something ""more important"" Bond fans have on their minds. Namely, how does Halle Berry look?!! Well, now, keep in mind, I have not seen the last two Bond films. She is the worst Bond girl I've ever seen. And, here's why. She's just too aggressive. She isn't as sexy as other Bond girls. There's a spark missing. And perhaps that spark has been missing in the past two films. And perhaps the Bond girls in the past two films have been very agressive also. But, it's a change I don't like. Now, mind you, I'm not saying that the Bond girls must be dumb or stupid. But in the old movies, the used their body to their advantage. In this movie she uses her muscle to her advantage. There just seems to be a certain tradition with these movies, and they are slowly taken it away. Also against Berry is the fact she isn't given much to work with. As far as that sleek Bond beauty goes, I must admit, I prefer the villian Bond girl, Rosamund Pike, who they have even given a better Bond name to, Miranda Frost instead of Berry's Jinx. And almost every bit of dialogue she has is a double meaning sex reference. I now, we've come to expect those things in a Bond film, but, here, you can expect them to come swiftly along about every 3 minutes.
 ""Die Another Day"" just lacks style. As an action movie the average joe, who isn't much of a Bond fan but maybe likes action movies will enjoy it. Like I said, there are plenty of action scenes, just not enough brains. But, if you were to judge this movie as part of the Bond series, then there is no doubt, this is the weakest of them all.
 So after all I've said, should you go see it. Yeah right, like my opinion will stop you! If you like action movies, this will suite you just fine. If you thought movies like ""XXX"" were cool and rank among the greatest films you ever saw, you'll like ""Die Another Day"". I think one of the biggest insults this film will ever get came from my 12 year old cousin, who I took to see this movie. He likes James Bond, and he's 12 years old, so what does he know you think? What does he know about movies. Show him guns and cars, and Halle Berry and you can't go wrong, right? But nope, even he saw through this movie, and said it was the worst Bond film he saw. He even hated it more than me!  ** 1\2  out of *****
 Bottom-line: In an attempt to make Bond more modern all they have done is made the weakest Bond film to date! Too many action scenes & too many double meaning jokes instead of interesting conversation between the characters. Sloppy and campy. Not the way Bond should be.",1038009600,4,5088,4.268672199170124

1454516,2,B00005JLBE,"I was looking forward to this, being a fan of the series, but I was extremely disappointed. The movie starts interestingly enough, with an interesting premise: Bond is suspected as a traitor. But it's all downhill from there, in my opinion. Maybe younger fans of the series will go for the techno-ish Madonna theme song, and the MTV (or Triple X?) influenced direction, but I didn't care for it. Other problems: some of the weakest double-entendre and quipping in the series -- Halle Berry's character even resorts to ""Yo' mama!"" at one point. Clever. Also the science (invisible car, virtual reality training, gene replacement machine) is the most unbelievably far-fetched in this series since the ridiculous Moonraker. And some of the special effects are bad -- really bad. There was almost a collective groan of disappointment in the theater where I saw it during a scene where Bond's vehicle went over a cliff -- the subsequent action sequence is as unconvincing. There is no big, memorable signature stunt in the movie, as many of the past movies have had. Too many elements seem borrowed from past movies, like, for instance, the space-weapon, which seems to have been taken straight from Diamonds are Forever. And how many times have we seen Bond trapped in a crashing airplane? The makers of this movie made intentional references to past Bond movies, including Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and You only live Twice, but they forgot to put anything original in. On the plus side, I still like Pierce Brosnan in the lead role, and the two main villains were pretty good. As to the ladies, I'll give the acting nod to the woman who played Ms. Frost over Berry, who was pretty one-dimensional. Overall, a pretty mediocre effort. Upon further reflection, I have to revise my opinion downward.  There's really very little worthwhile here.",1038009600,,1842,4.903846153846154
1454517,5,B00005JLBE,"While not quite on the level of Goldfinger or From Russia With Love (the best of the Bonds) in terms of suspenseful plot, Die Another Day matches and exceeds them in other areas and is unquestionably the best of the Brosnin Bonds and better than the majority if not all of the Moore Bonds. The movie breaks a number of ""established"" Bond conventions in terms of the traditional formula to good advantage. Without giving too much away, the film very early on establishes that Bond is NOT 100% invincible by demonstrating very harsh repercussions he undergoes in fullfilling a mission. Nice touch as it immediately creates a sense for the jaded Bond fan that he or she is seeing something new, a feeling that carries itself through the rest of the movie.
  The villians are very good.
  Halle Bery is very good.
  The sets and settings are excellent in many many ways.
  The action sequences steal the show. They are beyond excellent. The producers looked up finally and realized that Bond films should lead the adventure movie genre in terms of action sequences, and that there is a . . . a lot more and far far better competition in this area than in the sixties or seventies. They pulled out all stops on this one to be the best and it shows. The action shots are not only spectacular, they are equally suspenseful and thrilling.
  If Die Another Day is typical of the new direction for Bond, we may well be seeing the best Bond movies since Connery's tenure!",1038009600,4,1460,4.5807692307692305
1454518,4,B00005JLBE,"People, from one ""veteran"" Bond fan to another, let me just say that if you felt any reservations concerning ""Die Another Day"" whatsoever, rest your minds at ease...Bond #20 is in a word...AWESOME!!
Brosnan is at his best as agent 007, John Cleese appears to be a worthy successor to the role of Q (made famous by the beloved Desmond Llewelyn...who will forever be missed), Judi Dench and Samantha Bond have by now firmly rooted themselves as the perfect choices to bring the characters of M and Money Penny into the new millennium, and lets not forget the ever important ""icy"" villains and ever alluring women that complete the tried and true formula that is the classic Bond film!
Throw in a wonderful title song performed by Madonna, another amazing score by composer David Arnold, delightful references to the Bond films of the past, and what you get is simply the best Bond movie to be released in nearly 20 years!
""Die Another Day"" is everything that 007 fans have come to expect, and just goes to show that when it comes to pulse-pounding action and adventure, beautiful women and fiendishly diabolical villains...nobody does it better...than the one and only Bond...James Bond!!",1037923200,17,1186,4.876237623762377
1454519,4,B00005JLBE,"Having just watched this movie, I have to say it is by far one of the best Bond films made; gritty, realistic and exciting. However, you get the feeling that they are holding back too much with regard to the character of Bond himself, being very careful not to upset fans. The torture sequence at the beginning highlighted a different aspect of Bond which could've made for a very interesting movie had they gone down that route, but instead preferred to pull back to the familiar 007 with gadgets as soon as they could.
All in all, a very enjoyable well-made film, but certainly not the best Bond and almost left you wanting slightly more by the end. Well worth watching though - as any 007 film with Brosnan is. Halle Berry was excellent as ever and John Cleese is slowly making the role of 'Q' his own (no easy task).",1037923200,3,820,4.437086092715232

Lee Tamahori wanted to do the best 007's adventure ever, he just did the worst. Worse than the ones with Roger Moore, and we could even consider 'The World Is Not Enough' to be a Masterpiece. Mediocre special effects, and the most stupid of all gadgets, an invisible Aston Marton. The song is unhearable. Only the fencing sequence is correct. It is in fact a too futurist vision of James Bond, too many explosions, and too many ridiculous sets. What a waste of money ! Poor Ian Fleming, what they done to your creation.

1454523,5,B00005JLBE,"Lee Tamahori began the project that is now ""Die Another Day"" with a distinctly modern vision for the future of 007 film adventures. After the overblown, underplayed ""World is not Enough"" which seemed too confused with its own self by the last hour, Tamahori has promised us a gritty, tough Bond film; fast-paced, character-driven, with no letdowns in the action department. And I truly believe this will be Brosnan's best picture, if not one of the best Bond films since the Connery days (as it seems the film itself delivers nods to the series' distinguished past). Halle Berry seems determined to give us one of the most memorable Bond girls since Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No"", complete with the same ""Honey Ryder"" bikini and knife; and Toby Stephens, a rookie in film-acting, looks prepared to provide for a great central villain (along with his disfigured colleague, Zao). Locations, including Spain, Korea, and Iceland, look stunning in the trailers I have seen so far, and the general plot seems well developed and crafted (involving mistaken identities, betrayal, and Bond going freelance to exact revenge upon a traitor). A new car, a new Q, a fresh new, modern glint will combine (I hope) to make this a revolutionary Bond production; in the same way ""Dr. No"" revolutionized the world of spy thrillers.",1036281600,33,1309,4.954545454545454

adventure and have no reason to doubt it will be a smash hit. I
believe Pierce Brosnan is truly cut out for Ian Flemings character. Halle Berry ought to be a notable addition to this film, supported by Brosnan as well as Brit's Judi Dench, John Cleese and Samantha Bond. But it is going to be difficult not
seeing 'my main man' Q (Desmond Llewellen) who, since his death
will be greatly missed by HMSS, the fans and fellow actors. I
sincerely hope a tribute of some kind will be presented on his
behalf. Madonna should do very good singing the title song, and
I read she has a bit part as well. I hear a brandnew Ford T-Bird
will be featured. Bravo, I'm not too keen on the Euro machines
anyway. BRING ON THIS AGELESS ACTION ADVENTURE HERO....!!",1036195200,2,872,4.323170731707317

7939234,4,B00005JLBE,"Pierce Brosnan returns for one more outing as James Bond in a story that while exciting becomes something of an amalgam of 40 years of James Bond movies.

Bond deals with an ordinary smuggling operation that is blown from a traitor within MI6 as he serves time in a North Korean prison. Exchanged but disgraced, Bond is burned as he goes on a journey to clear his name but also find out what this conspiracy is all about. From North Korea, Hong Kong, Cuba, England and Iceland, this Bond movie lives up to its predictable but glorious adventure in the world of espionage.

This was a pretty cool story, supported by Brosnan looking good in the role and adding some of his strong intensity. But the story is far fetched of his stories, feeling more like the silly adventures of Roger Moore. North Korea is a legitimate threat, but coat that with diamonds scarred on henchmen faces, unrealistically gorgeous women, and outrageous adventure, I can see why this is slightly marred.

Still, its not exactly atypical Bond stuff. Great stuff for fans. B",1517097600,,1046,4.704918032786885
