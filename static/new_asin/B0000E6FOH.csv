8001934,1,B0000E6FOH,"This hokey and disjointed thriller is reminiscent of the British horror films of the sixties, slow and methodical, but without the ultimate payoff.  So much time is spent in setting up the relationship of its three protagonists that little suspense is generated and the script hops back and forth in time without any obvious breaks so its hard to keep up with just when this stuff is going on.  Suffice to say, the story follows a young artist and her ex-husband and current boyfriend, who were all the best of friends when youths.  Since the divorce, however, hubby Martin has become desperately possessive and even psychotic.  The script tries to pull some twists, but they're so contrived and implausible that the final effect isn't a desired one I'm sure.  The acting is mediocre except for a nice turn from Margaret Tyzack as the girl's nosy neighbor and confidante.  Not spooky at all, folks!",1148947200,2,898,4.836601307189542
