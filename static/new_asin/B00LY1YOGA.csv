6510261,4,B00LY1YOGA,"""The Theory of Everything"" (2014 release from the UK; 122 min.) brings the story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. As the movie opens, we are reminded that we are in ""Cambridge, 1963"". Stephen and Jane are going to university in Cambridge, and they meet at a party. It is immediately clear that there is a spark between them, but Stephen is either shy or ignorant about women. Fortunately Jane does not give up on him. Meanwhile, it is not long (15 min.) in the movie that we see Stephen starting to struggle with an oncoming illness. He is eventually diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and is given 2 years to live. Despite the stern warnings of Stephen's father that ""this is going to be a heavy defeat', Jane decides to push on with Stephen. All the while, Stephen is also working towards his Ph. D. in physics. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this does not strive or is intended to be a biopic of Stephen Hawking, but instead it brings the story of Stephen and Jane. This is only confirmed when in movie's end titles, I noticed that the script is based on Jane's memoir (""Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen""). Second, much has been made about the acting performances so let's get to that: yes, the rumors are true: Eddie Redmayne, previously best known from My Week With Marilyn and Les Miserables, will blow you away as Stephen, reminding me of Daniel Day Lewis' defying role in My Left Foot all those years ago. Watch Redmayne collect many an award in the upcoming awards season. But equally brilliant is Felicity Jones as Jane. I saw Jones recently in ""Breathe In"", where she was completely miscast as a high school exchange student (she is 30 in real life). Here, she get a mature role that seems tailor-fit for her. Surely this will get noticed as well in the upcoming awards season. Third, the movie's production and photography is brought with richness and lushness. Fourth, the orchestral score, courtesy of composer Johann Johannsson, is as sentimental as it is delightful. If there is one negative comment that I have about the movie, it is that the scientific side of Stephen Hawking's academic work is all but left untouched. I am not the wiser now than I was before the movie as to why Hawking's theories are so important and set him aside from many other thinkers and scientists of his generation. A missed opportunity in my opinion although as stated before, I don't think the movie ever intended to explore that aspect in detail.

The movie opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which really surprised me. Seeing that the movie has been garnering a lot of positive buzz in recent weeks, I would've thought that people would come in droves to see this. All that aside, the bottom line is ""The Theory of Everything"" is a wonderful and tender look at Jane and Stephen Hawking's relationship, and the two lead performances will dazzle you. ""The Theory of Everything"" is HIGHLY RECOMENDED",1417392000,241,3146,4.687160940325497

6510308,5,B00LY1YOGA,"In the memory of Stephen Hawking, I wanted to give this movie 5 stars and the fact that I suck as a movie critic.  This movie does a great job explaining the struggles of Stephen Hawking in his early years, and how he rose to be the person that he became before his passing day.  I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are a strict theist as it does question the existence of God; but if you can approach this movie with an open mind, then I think you'll appreciate what this movie has to show.  The casting for this movie and all the production teams were all perfect in my opinion, I feel as though they did a great job depicting the life of Stephen Hawking...",1526169600,,662,4.196850393700787

6510310,4,B00LY1YOGA,I like this movie. Eddie Redmayne went full on into his role.  Its a bit too melodramatic at times which took me out of the story but overall i really liked it. It even held my middle school science classes attention.,1525910400,,217,4.2926829268292686
6510321,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This movie is brilliant on several levels... the actors, the director, the choice in where to have words and then the lack of words in profound moments of realization in their lives and how the actors expression told what words could not express;  the presentation of how they dealt with the unique circumstances that made up their lives; the way the ending led back to the beginning of such spectacular happenings to these people.  I was in awe at this whole presentation and how it was presented.  Such a refreshing  story of their complexity put to film is a rarity... showing the beauty of their character in dealing with their unique situation and the way love flowed throughout their lives... it is so wholesomely told. It is a story of the human spirit and how we can overcome adversity and deal with 'sticky' moments and still show how wonderful humanity is meant to be.  It is indeed a movie for the human spirit with a Godly woman and an atheist; it was intriguing.",1525651200,,975,4.61271676300578

6510330,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Stunning! I rarely write reviews, but this movie literally changed me. Its tone kind of reminded me of 'Amadeus', another favourite of mine.  I have always been a Stephen Hawking fan, but seeing this absolutely made me fall in love with him even more. I was absolutely taken by Eddie Redmayne's performance in this, and I will forever think of him as Stephen.  It was a very well deserved Oscar indeed. The acting and casting was immaculate. I literally sob every time I watch it, it is so very moving...
Some people were clearly wishing for a more detailed explanation of his physics theories, and although those are somewhat discussed in the film, they are not the focus for a good reason: We are instead looking at Stephen's and Jane's lives, and at his perseverance, at the inspiration that he has been to humanity, at his courage to endure and to continue living with a wonderful sense of humour and disposition in spite of living with ALS. Perhaps his book provides better details about his theories. At any rate, this is a beautiful story, and it is very much worth watching and buying. It is a beautiful piece, absolutely indispensable in any DVD collection.",1523318400,,1166,4.71078431372549

6510376,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I study physics and mathematics and I'm just finishing up my bachelors degrees. I've read pieces of Hawking' s dissertation and I was astounded how accurately they represented it (those are actual pictures of it!). The performances were breathtaking from every actor and actress. It feels amazing to have a movie not shy away from the real genius behind science; math. Hawking says it best himself, ""there is no *believing* in physics"".

It deeply saddens me he has recently passed away. It destroyed any small hope I had of meeting the man. He is responsible for much of my love for science and my academic career.

I may never be as humble, intelligent, successful, or lucky as him, but I will surely try. He was a brilliant man, and will always be my hero. I am humbled to have shared the same timeline of humanity with him.
I hope his legacy continues to inspire other students of science.",1521331200,,893,4.6455696202531644

6510484,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Enjoyed this movie for its multifaceted story of a man in love with science and a woman in love with that man of science. Theories to prove the existence of black holes, God or intelligent alien life in the vast universe can't hold a candle to the unproven theories behind why a good woman will sacrifice all for the love of one man, regardless of his Intelligence Quotient, physical abilities and/or flaws.

The acting and musical score In ""The Theory of Everything"" are brilliant. Everything you see and hear in this movie, whether it be a couple's hands caressingly touching, the crippling effects of ALS or the fearful look in the eyes of those watching the physical changes ALS brings upon the body of a loved one, add to the care and concern of the viewer.

Mrs. Jane Hawking is the hero and teacher in this movie. She's showing us what the life of a loving wife, primary caregiver and loyal friend to a man the likes of world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking looks and feels like.  I hate to say it, but the genius Stephen Hawking only need look back on the love and loyalty of his wife Jane in order to see and believe that yes, there is a God looking over his life and that of his children. The question is not are there other forms of life in the universe, but are there other forms of love. For what is life without love, but survival of the fittest. Wow, did I say that!",1501372800,,1384,4.3984375

6510487,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Regardless of what you believe concerning Stephen Hawking or the universe, this movie carries with it a deep and respective understanding of what it means to be human. Carefully crafting Hawking's life, from his marriage to Jane, or the development of his theories about the universe we live in, ""The Theory of Everything"" paints a picture of love, loyalty, pain, brokenness, and eventually, a strange yet haunting fulfillment of hope. No doubt the message of this movie is powerfully represented: that human kind, though one primate among many, can find hope in the theory that there are no limits to our humanity, just as there are no limits to the stars. Though many disagree with this, myself included, I can't argue with the fact that this movie argues its point well in a cinematic masterpiece that moves you emotionally, and for some, intellectually as well. And they use Hawking's story as a case-in-point example. Despite his disease, he lived well beyond the life expectancy that was branded on his life, lived a fulfilled and happy marriage, and became the successful Ph. D he dreamed of one day being. And it was perhaps his own victory against his struggles that brought him to the conclusion that there is no limit stamped on humanity. The film depicts Stephen and Jane's struggle against his disease, as they both try to keep their family together, and he tries to get his Ph. D. In a very raw depiction of the two, the viewer gets a very real sense of what they actually went through and what it cost them, but also what they gained.
As a film, I don't think I have ever seen, nor ever will see a movie so well acted. Eddie Redmayne was absolutely phenomenal, and I didn't doubt for a second that he wasn't Hawking himself. His physical acting, as well as his emotional acting were truly awe inspiring, acting at its finest. Felicity Jones and the other major players of the film were incredible as well, easily playing upon the emotions of there characters, staying in character flawlessly, and making every second of the movie believable.
Technically, this film was easy to watch, and well directed, and was entertaining all the way through. Though I disagree with Hawking, I am hard pressed to think of another biographical drama that beats ""the Theory of Everything"". Excellent film...please do watch!
Parental guide: sexuality is limited to conversational implications of an appropriate nature, as well as a brief look at a Penthouse magazine towards the end. Cursing is countable one hand, and thematic details, though not appropriate for a child, are good for anyone above the age of 12-13.

Felicity didn't quite age herself enough by the end of the movie, but she did a great job through most of it and was convincing enough as a caring, loving wife who dealt with the situation as best she could.  What a sad story, though really.  I didn't know much about Stephen Hawking's love life, so I wasn't expecting the story to end the way it did.  I only wish the relationship began a little less abruptly.  They met at a party, she gave her his number, but we didn't get a chance to see what initially attracted her to him and him to her.  They simply started dating, but the courtship moved along quickly.  Before I knew it, I was absorbed by Redmayne's ability to transform himself, the way realistic portrayal of his struggles, and touching relationships that developed.",1483833600,,894,4.55

Done by a very delicate actor Eddie Redmayne we all know him from movies like <THE DANISH GIRL><LES MISERABLES><MY WEEK WITH MARYLINE>.
He finally won the best actor from Oscar with this movie. But not many people noticed this film properly.
It only grossed  $35,887,263 (USA).

It is not healthy telling the story but as I may,..
When Stepen figures out his illness during studying at Cambridge when very young, he even tried to avoid the most beautiful girl he just met.
The most beautiful girl is the right word.
But it was her who came to him this time and she approached and said even if your life will be only 2 years left, I want to marry you.
They got married.
But as someone said, love don't last forever.
Their marriage didn't last forever.
You know when a guy becomes a totally crippled it's not a life anymore and for a wife it is not fair to be together anymore.
More over, for him the love is totally gone and everything becomes just annoying. His temper is no longer sweet or even he is not thankful for her.
What can she do?
When there is a guy who is servicing for church appears, there is no denying that she is in love with him although she has two children already.
Even there is a roumour that their third child is not their's.
When Stephen is having another attack and this time he lost his voice, it becomes a total black in his life. He seems like no more life left in him.
For her it is a hell too.
And then there appears this a bit old but sweet woman nurse. She is madly admiring Stephen and everywhere Stephen goes he wants her to go too.
One day he tells his wife that he wants to be with her.
Naturally they have to be apart.
Even now the first wife and Stephen are just friends they each have different marriage.
But as we all know Stephen is a living legend with not able to speak, move or expose his feeling without his computer.
But it is truely magical what he have done so far.
This movie is not afraid of showing what has he go through in his life.
It was not all rainbows and sunshines.
There are some ugliness things happened and they showed them all.

James Marsh made a lot of documentaries in his life and if you see this film you can see that how much he have researched and deeply digged before making this film.

This movie won 24 awards some best actor some best film. Worth watching for sure.",1476057600,,2655,4.293413173652695

A feeling of disconnect with the writing and the joy of science is obvious. After reading a few of Hawking's books and biography this film just didn't feel right. If you like Hawking and love Science there is another film with Benedict Cumberbatch titled ""Hawking"" that gets the feel of Hawking's Love for science and intellectual triumphs more accurately portrayed.",1472774400,,484,4.914634146341464

6510809,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I knew enough about Stephen Hawking, but after seeing The Theory of Everything, I wanted to know everything.

It's the story of a brilliant man and the woman who loved him. It's a love story, and I'm a sucker for love stories. The Theory of Everything is based on a book by Jane Hawking about her life with Stephen Hawking. From that spark of love at first sight, to when his disease first hits, to how they cope with it in the years to come, you want to be there with them through it all.

Part of what makes this film great are the performances by Redmayne and Jones. Both actors clearly studied the people they were based on and it shows through how they portray their speech and physical quirks. It's so good I actually believed I was watching Stephen Hawking and his wife at times.

There's one very particular scene, I don't know if it's based on a real event or not, but Stephen looking through his sweatshirt into a fire and becoming inspired was an amazing scene. The way it was shot and what was showed, he didn't have to say a single word but you completely understood the metaphor of what exactly was happening. I had to watch that scene a few times because I get goosebumps every time.

I want to thank Jane and Stephen Hawking for sharing their love story with us. Recommended.",1471651200,,1291,4.389121338912134

6510884,3,B00LY1YOGA,"The movie begins with both attending prestigious Cambridge University in England. Hawking is a cosmologist studying for his Ph. D. in physics. Jane Wilde is studying French and Spanish Arts and working for a Ph. D. in Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula. He is diagnosed with a motor neuron disease known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He eventually loses all ability to control muscle movement and given a two year life expectancy. Hawking wanted to prove with a mathematical equation that time had a beginning; time is not infinite. He also demonstrated that, although, black holes (at the center of galaxies) have an extreme gravitational pull that visible UV light cannot escape, they do emit heat radiation (not visible to the human eye). Over eons, black holes evaporate away until they disappear.",1465257600,,802,5.083333333333333
6510885,5,B00LY1YOGA,"The Theory of Everything is the journey that Stephen and Jane Hawking took based on the book by Jane Hawking, Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen. This is a beautiful story of love, passion and sacrifice.  Astrophysics Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) is brilliant and his scientific passions of discovery can not be stopped. As a Cambridge student Stephen met the love of his life, Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones).

As they began to experience life and each other, Stephen begins to notice that he is unable to perform everyday simple tasks like picking up a pen or walking. It was later discovered that Stephen had Lou Gehrig's Disease and was diagnosed with only a few years to live. Despite this diagnosis and the complications that he began to experience he and Jane marries and have three children.

As the disease began to take its toll on Stephen he continues on with his scientific passions.  Jane had to play dual roles from the caretaker of Stephen and helping him with his written reports to being solely responsible for the care of the children. For me, The Theory of Everything provided two sides of the coin 1) no matter what obstacles occurs in life, you can accomplish anything and 2) the choices of sacrifice that you make, should harbor no regrets.",1465171200,,1291,4.7757847533632285

Although he warned his girlfriend of his disease and the two years he's been given to live. she still insists on marrying him. She is a tireless and determined wife who becomes exhausted and frustrated by the work involved in taking care of her disabled husband. Ultimately they end in divorce.

6511010,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This film is based on the book MY LIFE WITH STEPHEN HAWKING by Jane Hawking.  As such, the angle in which the story proceeds is a love story between the physicist and his girlfriend & subsequent wife.  For the most part, the research of his life as well as the writing of his 1st book (A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME)  are in the background.  In the forefront are the more human issues of the scientist's life, such as his struggle with ALS and raising his family as best he could under the circumstances.

Even more than the above issues, the focus of the film are on Jane's travail in having to cope with a husband who, albeit brilliant, is also in deteriorating health.  His speech is so slurred that only she & a few other close friends can understand him B4 he's unable to speak @ all.  Thankfully, a software whiz from the U.S. (CALTECH, if I remember correctly?) offers him a speech synthesizer which gives his thoughts a familiar computer voice that most of us are now acquainted with.

Eddy Redmayne bears a striking resemblance to Hawking in the film and he is believable as someone who is afflicted with ALS.  The movie gives us an insight into the day-to-day issues that Hawking has had to deal with when the most basic things such as eating and moving around become arduous tasks.

For anyone who is interested in the life of an influential scientist, this is a must-see movie.  It is about a man who attempts to comprehend the mysteries of the cosmos whilst confined to a wheelchair:  that in & of itself is inspiring!!  Also, people who enjoy this movie will be apt to enjoy the movie INFINITY with Mathew Broderick.  It, too, is about the love story involving a scientist ~ Richard Feynman.  In that case, it is his wife who is dying from ALS while he is working @ Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project days of WWII.  Both films are well worth your time & attention.",1454803200,,1877,4.46041055718475

6511046,3,B00LY1YOGA,"I suppose I was expecting a better movie based on all the accolades it received. With such high expectations it is difficult to not be a bit disappointed.

Redmayne does a fine job contorting his body, slurring his words and expressing emotion non-verbally, but Felicity Jones actually does a better job of acting as Jane. The movie really is about Stephen and Jane's relationship rather than his science which makes sense because that relationship enabled his genius to flourish. (A movie about the science would be a series on Nova.)  I am not, however, a fan of movies that attempt to compress decades of a life, or lives, into 2 hours. They invariably end up feeling shallow and unsatisfying. This is a fine movie and worth seeing - once. It is not a movie I will see more than once because there really is nothing in it that one misses the first time. There is no nuance, no complex message, no underlying theme to go back and ponder or re-examine.",1452902400,2,953,4.6

I really cannot go on much more, because I will start to get emotional again. But I never guessed I could be so deeply moved in the telling of a love story between a scientist and a poetry major.

6511124,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Eddie Redmayne was awarded a well-deserved Academy Award for Lead Actor in a Movie with his performance as the legendary physicist and genius, Stephen Hawking CBE CH. As we all know, Stephen Hawking was a brilliant physics student until he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease with only two years to live. He married Jane Wilde and fathered three children. Despite the prognosis of two years later, he has defied the odds and is still very much alive although confined to wheelchair with a speaking box.

This movie is about marriage, defying the odds, and miracles. Stephen and Jane's marriage evolves over the decades. Jane's relationship with Jonathan is complicated. Although Stephen shouldn't be patronized for his lack of physical abilities, he is quite capable of making mistakes. His relationship with eager nurse Elaine Mason led to a marriage that ended in divorce. Stephen and Jane still remain friends and parents and grandparents to their grandchildren.

Stephen's story is very much Jane's story as well. In watching this film, you can't help but see their marriage survive and endure the odds. Stephen Hawking was honored with a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) and the prestigious Companion of Honour (only 65 living recipients are at one time). Stephen has declined knighthood. Ironically, Eddie Redmayne gets a real visit to Buckingham Palace to be awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire).

Eddie Redmayne has mastered Stephen's mannerisms for this film. Felicity Jones mastered the personality of Jane Wilde Hawkings. Maxine Peake does a notable job as Elaine Mason, his nurse and future second wife. The film doesn't bring up the relationship except to end the Jane and Stephen's marriage. Stephen asks Elaine to accompany him to America.

The DVD has the film; the making of Hawkings; and several deleted scenes including Stephen being awarded the CH (Companion of Honour) with an actress to play Queen Elizabeth II.",1449878400,,2003,5.116207951070336

6511135,4,B00LY1YOGA,"I wasn't expecting the Theory of Everything to MOVE me so much emotionally!  It's about the struggles of Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) first discovering out the hard way by passing out on university campus back in 1962 that he has a neurological disorder and will lose all the strength in muscles.  Even worse he was supposed to be dead in 2 years.  If I was Stephen in that situation I would've been devastated.  The doctor should have mentioned this news more understandingly but I guess in the early 60's compassion wasn't top priority when it came to certain things.

Luckily Stephen falls in love with a young intelligent woman (Felicity Jones) who's willing to do everything in her power to keep Stephen alive knowing full well he's a genius.  At first it's recommended by her friends to avoid Stephen since he's a weird college guy, but due to Stephen's persistence he eventually gets the girl he desires.  Keep in mind Stephen's healthy at this point and able to walk around normally since the relationship develops before the neurological disorder happens.  Stephen sort of has to chase after the girl he desires since she has a way of shying away at first, but she turns out to be an extremely important person in helping Stephen get through his new condition (which is interestingly also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).  An interesting/humorous moment when British Stephen tries explaining to his fellow students he has the same disease as a famous baseball player, but they aren't sure why he's mentioning baseball.

While some of Felicity's ways later on are quite questionable (she falls in love with Charlie Cox's character even though she has a few kids with Stephen and understands more than anybody his constant struggles day in and day out, which makes her pretty lousy) she also does a tremendous job providing encouragement to Stephen to help him through his daily struggles while the marriage is fresh.  So Felicity still deserves to be respected in my opinion for all that she did in helping Stephen, even if she began to fall for another man.

It's important to note that the Theory of Everything focuses on the emotional side of Stephen Hawking instead of his genius theories (such as his wish to prove that everything in the universe can be explained by a simple black hole theory).  Oh sure we see Stephen as a college kid attending astronomy classes and becoming one of the most intelligent students in his class with theories that were criticized by his professors at first but later accepted when they began to realize his theories make sense.  However the subject of his expertise isn't touched upon as much as one would think in this movie.

Instead the Theory of Everything mainly focuses on Stephen getting married to his wife, their lives in a new house in the country with kids, Felicity's affection for Charlie (that Stephen must have known about though wasn't stated), the tear-jerking moments showing Stephen struggling to stand up and be as normal as possible (of which there are MANY of these, making for one tough film to handle) to Stephen eventually getting the technology to turn his electric wheelchair into a computer-based communication system which is what we associate with Stephen these days.  I sort of thought Stephen played a part in inventing such a technology but maybe I was wrong.  Either way it's surprise that not only were electric wheelchairs available back in the 60's, but that a voice communication system was made not long after.

Oddly I never realized such a technology existed back in the day, however we're never sure exactly what period of time Stephen is able to speak using this voice technology because the movie has a way of moving several years into the future but they really saying or showing when it happens, and the characters don't exactly age a whole lot either so it's hard to know when these events really occurred.  At least I understood near the end we were many years after the 70's but I couldn't tell you what year.

Some things weren't quite explained and were left for us to interpret.  Such as the redheaded lady played by Maxine Peake brought over to be a teacher to Stephen after he loses his muscle moving abilities completely.  It wasn't stated during the film whether the two developed a relationship even though it was clearly leaning towards one.  I suppose they explain this at the very end before the credits role, but while the movie's happening it's really subtle.  I guess Felicity knew.  Plus Stephen invited Maxine for an American trip and things were explained more clearly then.  Still not 100% clearer however.  More should have been explained about Stephen's theories to possibly clear up this one.

Also while giving a presentation, Stephen sees a girl drop a red pen on the floor.  We then see Stephen stand up, walk over, pick it up and give it to her.  I'm pretty sure he simply imagined doing this and wasn't physically able to but you never know.  Also the third kid Stephen and his wife had.  It was implied by Felicity's mother that it might actually be Charlie's kid because she must have known Felicity and Charlie were getting along a little too well while running around in the backyard with Stephen, and Felicity storms out of the kitchen embarrassed shortly after.  So the two had feelings, but was that third kids theirs?

The ending was really sad.  I don't know what it was, but watching the constellations, the universe and stars developing so enchantingly while the orchestrated music played made me think just how incredibly sad it is that we have to grow older and eventually die, so I honestly cried while watching this scene... cried a lot.  Must be one of those days.

Overall this movie does a tremendous job teaching us what Stephen Hawking's life was like as a college student and how much he had to endure.  The doctors originally said he only had 2 years to live when his first diagnosis happened, so to watch him barely survive a couple major near death experiences later on was really crazy.  I think we all knew he survived, but how many of us understood everything he had to face?  Just unbelievable what this man had to go through.  Also the movie does have one humorous moment- when Maxine holds up a dirty magazine after Stephen apparently ordered one and flips through the pages much to his liking, because she knows what guys are interested in, haha.  Overall really good movie.  Perhaps more focus on Stephen's groundbreaking theories would have made this a 5-star film.",1449187200,,6532,4.779162956366874

6511171,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This is a stunning and memorable British biographical romantic drama that touches the heart, the soul and the mind. This is based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking.

This is a spectacular movie of history, education and the ultimate exploration and understanding of the life of one of the greatest minds of all time. You get to go along with Hawking's life and love and passion and ultimate struggle. I have always been fascinated with Stephen Hawking. I have read all his books and I am in utter amazement at the man and of his genius. It's wonderful seeing a personal side, the emotional reality. The tense struggle. The visionary filmed form.

This is lovingly put together. One of the best examples of a film about not only the person in biographical plot, but its about the loved ones involved. A stunning portrait of this great man. This is possibly one of the best acting performances I have seen in a very long time. A movie of perfection put together in that you the watcher can see the love, passion and fascination put into this film about this genius. Most of all its about the emotional reality of the struggle and the depth of this challenging disease and the hardships loved ones and the one going through it has to bare.

The movie showcases the beautiful and rough parts of Hawking's life to a crystal clarity. The man that brings this part to life is a young man that I have absolutely fallen in love with throughout his acting career. This part as Hawking's, gives you the viewer what the art form and mastery of acting is, Eddie Redmayne aces this part and deserves all the accolades for this performance. The next Golden Ticket of acting perfection goes to the beautiful Felicity Jones who plays Jane, Stephen's wife and companion. Jones is so emotionally great in this part. She and Redmayne are gifted. Loved both of them.

A flawless example of how to create a wonderful film. I have already watched it twice. I really loved the experience. To anyone and everyone that wants to explore or experience a thought provoking example of brilliant acting and explore the exploration of this amazing man and story then look no further than The Theory of Everything.

A passionate and beautiful and sad at times amazing film. I shed tears at times. Jane Wilde Hawking's was a wonderful and strong woman for Stephen. She stood by him for many, many years and treated him with beauty. Felicity Jones captures her perfectly. The whole movie expresses itself with a passionate heart.

Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones shine together. Perfect chemistry. A very emotional experience that showcases itself into a masterpiece of acting reality. Great direction by James Marsh. He captures the love, the struggle and the wonderment of the story into a filmed form.

If I had to choose a flaw to this amazing movie it would be the co-stars not being able to showcase there amazing talent. This movie is filled with phenomenal actors such as the extraordinary David Thewlis who acted in one of my favorite films of all time Mike Leighs Naked. The beautiful and amazing Emily Watson. The wonderful amazing Harry Lloyd. The brilliant Simon McBurney. The perfect Adam Godley. Just an amazing cast of co-stars. The craftsmanship of each of these stars shined just having their names in the small parts that they showcased. The movie held its power with an amazing cast of stars and co-stars in their small parts. The whole movie, creates an acting art form.

A Brief History of Time has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

Now 72 years old, Stephen has no plans to retire and continues to seek a Theory of Everything.  He declined the offer of a knighthood from the Queen.

 Jane has her Ph. D. in Medieval Spanish Poetry.  She and Jonathan are happily married.

 Jane and Stephen remain friends and now have 3 grandchildren.

The above is printed on-screen at the very end of this excellent British biographical romantic drama film based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking (2007).

This movie deals with Janes relationship to her ex-husband, theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking, his diagnosis of ALS or motor neuron disease (also called Lou Gehrigs disease), and his success in physics.

Heres what the real S. Hawking says about this movie:

Its a human interest story.  Success against the odds.  It shows that disability can be no handicap...It reflects our struggle to bring up three children in normality despite my disability.

I liked the way this film blended science with romance, quite a unique combination.

Here is the dialogue of one of my favorite scenes when Jane and Stephen are still dating:

Jane: What about you?  What are you?
Stephen: Cosmologist, Im a Cosmologist.
J: What is that? [That is, what is Cosmology?]
S: It is a kind of religion for intelligent atheists.

Eddie Redmaynes performance as Stephen Hawking is mesmerizing.  This is what the real S. Hawking said about Redmaynes performance:

I think Eddie Redmayne portrayed me very well.  He spent time with ALS sufferers so he could be authentic.  At times, I thought he was me.

Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking gives a strong performance.  This is what the real J. Hawking says about Jones performance:

Felicity was absolutely superb.  I was very impressed with Felicity because she came [to see me] several times and we talked a lot.  And, then when I saw her on the screen, I thought Oh, my goodness.  Thats me.  Because she had captured my mannerisms.  And not only that, but I could recognize my modes of speech through Felicityit was a beautifully played part.

I also enjoyed the background music.  It has a dainty precision with a scientific quality to it.  This music definitely enhances each scene.

This movie has earned back more than eight times its budget (of fifteen million dollars).  It also captured five Academy Award nominations (with Redmayne winning for best actor).

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2015) has three interesting extras.  It is from one of these extras that I obtained the above quotes by the real S. and J. Hawking.

In conclusion, this is a tremendously moving and inspirational movie, a bittersweet love story, inflicted with tasteful good humor with superb performances from its two leads.  It shows how the love of a dedicated wife allowed the genius of her severely disabled husband to bloom!!

OK, I get it, he's an amazing theoretician. Nevertheless, in this portrayal he seems to me to be a person oblivious to the cost of his illness on others. About halfway through I realized that his genius was so central that those around him, especially his wife and kids, had no real life other than attending to him. I was honestly amazed how long she stayed faithful and committed to him when he seemed to take so much and give so little back. It truly just seemed like another ""faithful wife sacrifices all to genius husband"", and I think we've seen enough of those already.",1444176000,3,792,4.545454545454546

The story in and of itself is fascinating, but this particular rendition or approach is of such magnificent, outstanding sensitivity to all the nuances, personal interactions and facts that one cannot come away from this with anything else but the impression that this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.",1443916800,,652,4.9363636363636365

Having received a tracheotomy myself in an emergency surgery when 3 (which I do remember part of), watching that particular scene really upset me, I had to close my eyes because it was way too graphic for me, since I've had one.  Plus at that point in the movie we knew that he'd no longer be able to speak but this would save his life. It was a VERY moving scene to see him go through.  His wife Jane stood by his side for a very long time and I can't imagine her journey with Dr H was easy.  Wonderful insight into a very interesting and complicated man.

This genius has surpassed every obstacle. Truly a miracle. I took away points because of how softly and inability for me to understand his wife. I often moved the movie back and turned on the closed caption just to learn what she said. Many others I personally know felt the same way....especially when Felicity Jones was talking. I'm glad I watched this movie from home or I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the movie at all at tthe theater.

Studio's....this seems to be a trend in many movies and tv shows. Or t he music drowns out the voices. They need to watch old classic movies and learn how to use music in the background or enhance a scene.....not drown out the already soft spoken lines.",1442102400,,913,4.560975609756097

6511340,5,B00LY1YOGA,"In my personal list of the ten greatest performances of this decade, the mesmerizing acting of Eddie Redmayne occupies the second place (until this date)just behind Lincoln's portrait by Daniel Day Lewis. Felicity Jones is lovable too as Jane.

The only aspect I would like to add far beyond the enormous of positive comments around the film is this one. The science has its epic side. And Stephen Hawking is part of this elite (Newton, Darwin, Freud, Einstein, Gauss, Agazziz, Humboldt,Giordano Bruno) among the huge list of brilliant minds who challenged the status quo in their respectives ages and signed his name.

A lesson of life for all of those who complaint of minor issues and a decisive tribute for the new generations of propulsive investigators.

Kudos for all the crew that made it possible, because they defied the rules of game.

6511357,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This movie was beyond fantastic. Redmayne's acting was superb, he had to have studied Stephen Hawking in great detail and for a very long time, as what we see him go through - the gradual, then quickening decline of his health and muscle control - is mind boggling. The story starts out so sweetly but quickly gets into Stephen's illness and my partner and I both cried all the way through the movie - both because of the sadness of his condition, the depression and exhaustion of Jane, the resulting side romances and the joys and sadnesses from those, etc - but also because Stephen Hawking is portrayed as SO understanding of their situation, financially, romantically, medically and he does his best to keep Jane happy. Hawking is also portrayed as having such a positive attitude (most of the time) and a great wit and humorous side, that laughter through tears is frequent while watching. The soundtrack is beautiful and really adds to the intensity of the emotions. We both work in medical fields and see people in various states of decline regularly, plus I have a partner who died of AIDS in 1994, having been intubated and then with a tracheostomy in the last few months - and he never talked again, either - so the movie hit close to home.

This movie does not fully go into everything the Hawkings endured, nor does it explain everything quite on spot.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!

What would have been REALLY helpful, while watching the movie, is if they'd have at least placed year markers throughout the movie, to help us keep track of when different things happened. We know Stephen and Jane met in 1963 and married shortly afterwards but as to when he had to finally use the wheelchair permanently, when did he receive his Doctorate, when was his pneumonia/tracheostomy done, when did Stephen receive the computerized voice (that finally gave him so much independance back)? Things like the years of his children's birth, he and Jane's separation and subsequent divorce, his marriage to Elaine, and the date of his final award/speech (shown in the film) would have been great.

After watching this movie (and finally getting my eyes dry enough to read), I read Professor Hawking's Wikipedia page to learn more (a book unto itself - and, I'm not a physicist so understood little of his work) - and this movie, quite honestly, barely scratches the surface - although he is now in his 70s and I believe this movie ended roughly in the late 90s. Of course, this movie was based off of Jane's book, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen. As such, it's a movie from her POV and about their life together, not all his accomplishments and, spanning roughly 4 decades, there is only so much time in a movie to show only so much. I am actually purchasing Jane's book now (she did write another before this but it was written earlier, while in a darker place in their relationship) because I found their story so fascinating, I want to learn more!",1441152000,,2960,4.7084942084942085

The actor who played Steven Hawking looked exactly like him and did an amazing job.
But I didn't see any chemistry between him and the actress who played Jane, his wife.

SPOILER ALERT..MAYBE.

This movie hinted at events in Steven Hawking's life, but was not clear.
I actually had to look him up to understand the ending.

Exactly what was he studying?
What theories did he come up with and what did they mean?
What was his book about?

This man is paralyzed.
He is as helpless as a newborn. He cannot do anything for himself.
He can only communicate because someone was kind enough to donate a talking machine to him.
He can only move around because an electric wheelchair was donated to him.

In his condition, this man manages to :

(1) Get married
(2) Finish school and become a professor
(3) Father a first, a second, and a third child
(4) Write a book and get it published
(5) Have an affair
(6) Leave his wife and move to America
(7) Divorce his wife and remarry
(8) Give lectures and continue a successful career
(9) Divorce his second wife
(10) Continue working into his 70s with no intentions of retiring
(11) I don't know what else, because the movie was unclear and I didn't spend that much time on Google

How many totally healthy men could accomplish these things?

The movie was completely unclear that Steven Hawking had an affair, left his wife, and married his nurse.

It was so unclear that I had to look it up on Google to understand exactly what happened.

All that we see in the movie is that Steven tells Jane that he is going to America, and she says that she did her best, but he never says that he is leaving her for another woman or that he is divorcing her, so it can be assumed that he is simply going to America for his career and that he is coming back to his wife. The writers of this movie seemed to think that the viewers would already know the story, so they didn't bother to detail it.  If I knew the whole story, then why would I want to watch the movie?

The movie absolutely never shows that Steven Hawking had an affair, fell in love with his nurse, left his wife, divorced his wife, remarried, and later divorced his second wife. What is the point of telling a story about a man's life if major facts are omitted?

I felt so bad for Jane. She was a loyal wife to a paralyzed husband.  When she married him, she believed that he only had two years to live. She had his three children and raised them plus cared for her helpless husband and put her own career on hold. She fell in love with another man, but did not have an affair, out of respect for her husband, and yet, her paralyzed husband actually had an affair and left her. I was glad to hear that Jane later married Jonathan, which was not explained in the movie.  Jane later wrote a book, which was also not mentioned in the movie.

The story of Steven Hawking's life should have been an amazing and inspiring movie if the writers had detailed it and told it properly and completely.",1439769600,5,3247,4.3316831683168315

6511426,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Formulaic and ultimately unconvincing -- uh-oh, another disease of the month film -- about the life of Stephen Hawking, based on a book written by his wife.  The actors are excellent, but you still don't come away with a sense of what is so exceptional about Hawking.  And watching Eddie Redmayne disintegrate before your eyes, at times mumbling incomprehensibly, is quite depressing.  It comes across as contrived and Hollywoodized -- a woman sacrificing for her disabled husband.  And although we are privy to sugar-coated scenes from their courtship and romance, there still isn't any real sense of the characters beyond cutouts here, and a few pronouncements about physics and the universe.  It's all nicely acted and photographed, with a gushing musical score, and there are heartfelt moments.  But in the final analysis, it comes across as saccharine, manipulated and contrived.  Emily Watson, who only appears briefly in the film, steals the show -- she is beyond superb, and vastly superior to the material.",1439596800,,1015,5.190184049079755

It touches on many aspects of their life, including their break-up, but to really get the full picture, I recommend the book,  ""Traveling to Infinity-My Life with Stephen"" by Jane Hawking.  This movie piques the interest to learn about these fascinating lives.  Very well cast.  Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones do a great job in their roles.  I can see why Eddie received the Oscar.

6511442,3,B00LY1YOGA,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I must confess to having mixed feelings about ""The Theory of Everything,"" which covers the life of Stephen Hawking, from his days as a young graduate student afflicted with ALS (called ""motor neuron disease"" in England) to the present time as a celebrated scientist who communicates via a computer and is confined to a wheelchair in an immobile state, for the rest of his days.

The film's scenarist, Anthony McCarten, wisely does not attempt to explain Professor Hawking's scientific theories in great detail but is more interested in depicting Hawking's sad physical decline along with the relationship with his first wife, Jane Wilde Hawking, who wrote the book the film is based on.

The goal is to hold Hawking up as an inspiration to all of ushere was a man who was given two years to live and is still alive in his seventies. Not only is he alive but is an international figure, having made great contributions to the field of physics and wrote a worldwide, best-selling book, explaining his theories in more simplified form, so the ordinary man on the street could understand his extremely difficult concepts.

The film has a beautiful score with performances that seem quite believable. Eddie Redmayne shines as Hawking in an extremely difficult, physically-demanding role. Still there's another voice in me that asks should Hawking really be viewed as an ""inspiration?"" Of course he is but on the other hand, if you were a genie and could take away Hawking's disease along with his super-intelligence, I believe that Hawking wouldn't hesitate to cast off his ""brains"" so he could walk again. What I am trying to say is that despite the inspiration, his life is still a tragedy.

In the end, is there really enough here to create a full-length feature film? Or would a documentary serve as a better vehicle to illustrate the Hawking story? The ""sad decline"" which I alluded to before is quite ably illustrated here for all to see. There's not much drama in that nor the eventual dissolution of Hawking's marriage to Jane, which was an inevitable resolution given the overall tragic circumstances.

""The Theory of Everything"" is a beautiful tribute to a man who made something out of his life despite a harrowing disability. In that respect, it accomplishes what it sets out to do. We all can be inspired by such a tale but ultimately, Hawking's accomplishment is no ""triumph."" The dream sequence where Hawking gets out of his wheelchair and picks up a pen while attending a conference reminds us that such a simple act trumps any of the afflicted scientist's intellectual accomplishments which is decidedly akin to nothing more than a Pyrrhic Victory.",1439424000,,2702,4.9144736842105265

It begins in 1963 and tries to hit all the high points -- including a number of his scientific achievements -- for the next 40 or so years.  There are written biographies about him and undoubtedly they can fill in more of the facts; certainly some of them will give more details about his scientific achievements.  But, for what it is, this movie is as good as any I've ever seen about a scientist.  A documentary would certainly be better for the scientific details, but I'm glad they took the effort to make this movie.  A good movie has the ability to show the personal side every bit as well as a documentary, ofttimes better.  Thanks to the cast and crew for a great job.",1438732800,,782,4.395833333333333

1.  Don't expect an entirely factual story.  I'm sure most is based on reality, but it did seem they had to take fictional twists on certain events to make a better movie.
2.  Don't expect a typical love story.  But it was a love story nonetheless.
3.  Don't expect a movie that focuses on his scientific achievements.  Instead, it focused on how his life was affected by this disease and how he was still able to achieve so much.  Its also about the huge sacrifices his wife made and how much she did to support him.

Ultimately, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I honestly thought I would be bored to tears but I kept watching the movie and only felt there were just a few slow points in the story.",1438732800,,959,4.417142857142857

For some of Stephen Hawking's actual research and very cool videos that I've found they are all over youtube and are much more scientific. This is a Hollywood movie and I thoroughly enjoyed the way Stephen was portrayed and I think the acting was astounding. It's one thing to ask an actor to look like they have emotion like love and hate but the way Eddie convinced me he was in pain or was struggling or wanted to say something so badly like he really couldn't was amazing. I would recommend and would watch again. I think its a very amazing story of his life and I hope Stephen enjoyed it as much as I did. I wish to meet him someday.,1437436800,,761,4.183673469387755

6511663,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This is my pick of best picture of the year.  Focusing on the the personal life of renowned British physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking and his wife, Jane, the film explores the difficulties and ambiguities of intimate relationships.  A perfunctory internet search indicates that the film did not fully deal with, but gave strong hints of some of the more distressful aspects of this love relationship between a brilliant, extremely physically debilitated, and famous man and his able-bodied and also brilliant wife.  Eddie Redmayne justifiably won an Academy Award for his depiction of Hawkings suffering.  The great gift of the film is that it gives equal attention to the life of Jane (kudos to actress Felicity Jones) who genuinely loves Hawking, but when she courageously agrees to be his wife and caregiver they have no idea that he will live for decades.  The film gives comforting insight that there are many ways to make a relationship work.",1436745600,,956,5.063694267515924

6511742,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This film is a biopic about brilliant physicist Stephen B. Hawking. Events of his life includes his personal struggle with the motor neuron disease throughout his life;the achievement that he made in theoretical physics; and his relationship and family life with his ex-wife Jane Wilde Hawking. The Theory Of Everything was directed by James Marsh and adapted by screenwriter Anthony McCarten from the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen written by Jane herself. It stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane respectively.

The movie starts with Stephen as a healthy active young man and a doctorate student at Cambridge wherein he meets fellow student Jane. Then he later was discovered to have a disease that will provide him limitations in terms of voluntary movement,control and breathing. Despite of it,he and Jane gets married to start a family life and he continues his work on physics with the study of time and universe. It focuses primarily on their relationship as well as the ups and downs that Stephen's condition had as he constantly deteriorate as the movie progresses but nevertheless continues to show the world that he is indeed one of the most brilliant minds in science despite of it.

While Science fanatics will definitely be somewhat left empty as the movie does not focus on Stephen's work,it still will be considered one interesting and brilliant film as we get to see the determination of one mind who never gave up on his mission in life despite the many challenges he faced brought about by the limitations of physical ability that was caused by his disease. Also,one will definitely empathize with the solid relationship between Stephen and Jane particularly the commitment of the latter to their marriage especially with the sacrifices she made for the former's sake. Finally,it is one film that was surely well written despite the fact that the theme on Stephen's professional life as a physicists is somewhat lacking given the attention of the film to his personal life particularly his relationship with Jane.",1436140800,,2075,5.0821114369501466

6511781,4,B00LY1YOGA,"No question one the striking and permanent questions that humankind has ponders since the beginning of existence, put many different ways depending of what is known, is how the universe was formed. In the old days that was a no-brainer because of course God did the deed and that ended the question, perhaps. But when humankind put aside that part of the question the guys and gals who were still interested in how it was formed had a field day, and are still doing so waiting for the next big idea to take root. For now though people, or rather professional observers, physicists and astronomers, are hovering around the black hole theory and the rest of us are going along. And the film under review, The Theory of Everything, the bio-pic rather semi-bio-pic of the extraordinary physicist Steven J. Hawking based on a memoir by his ex-wife Jane goes a long way to acknowledging his efforts at pitching that theory to the scientific community.

Of course that is not the only part the story that gets played out here since, except for nerds and geeks and their hangers-on, a story about a guy and a scientific theory would be a snorer. What makes this films plotline extraordinary is that Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) plugged on while suffering the debilitating effects of motor neuron disease which almost took his life and did take his voice and some other functions. So even if you are a little weak on your late unlamented attempts at understanding high school physics you can still appreciate the human struggle against all odds to survive that this ordeal thrown his way. (He was not expected to live more than a couple of years back in the 1960s when he developed the disease but as of 2015 he is still with us, hats off.)

Better yet this film avoids the snorer problem that Hollywood dreads and which follows films about science guys by putting plenty of romance, even if awkward and geeky romance, in the story-line. Everybody can get into the boy-girl thing (or all the contemporary other relationship combinations which produce a romance) and wonder, star-gazing wonder if you like, how Hawking and his wife, Jane (played by Felicity Jones) got through the whole thing as well as they did, and for as long as they did. Wonder too if we are missing something in that star-gazing when we undercover stuff about the sex lives of those geeky physicists in this film. See this one.",1435622400,,2396,4.715990453460621

Not sure of the accuracy of the movie related to his life, but since he's still alive, I would hope they were able to get pretty close.  The movie fascinated me not only because of Steven's life and the obstacles thrown in his path, but because of the theories in physics that he was able to expand and share.

6511867,5,B00LY1YOGA,"There are very few in the modern world that are unaware of the determination and indeed brilliance of 'Stephen Hawking'
who, faced with severe adversity continued to amaze, this is his remarkable story as portrayed by 'Eddie Redmayne'
With the World at his feet, 'Simon' a Cambridge student is told at the age of just 21 that he has 'Motor Neurone Disease' an
illness that will rapidly immobilize him, his life expectancy just 2 years.
His Brain won't be affected by the illness, he will try to cram a life-times work into this short time, he wants to expand and
develop his theories of time, so much to discover so little time.
Whilst at Cambridge he had met and fallen for 'Jane' (Felicity Jones) despite knowing their time will be short, they decide to
marry, they have Children.
'Jane' becomes his rock and is supportive and understanding, though as time slips by their relationship will become complex.
Determination in the face of adversity.......he continues his studies and expands his conclusions into the mysteries of time
itself, however proving his theories will take time, time he doesn't believe he has, however he beats the odds and becomes
renowned for his writings World-Wide........his work continues to this day.
'Eddie Redmayne' gives a stunning and convincing award worthy performance.
The film is a frequently intense and an often emotional journey as we see 'Simon Hawking' defy all odds to continue his work
over the past 50 years..........he has an incredible and indeed certainly got - A BEAUTIFUL MIND
Whatever ones taste in films this one in my view is - A Must See.
Superb Picture and Sound Quality throughout.

6511916,4,B00LY1YOGA,"Great acting by Redmayne and Jones.  Story is constricted by its biographical content and the need to arrive at a particular outcome.  One difficulty in the story is that the protagonist seems to be both about Jane (Hawking's first wife and author of the book from which the movie is derived) and Hawking himself.  So it's neither particularly about the struggle of a woman caring for a disabled genius, nor so much a story about a genius who becomes disabled and triumphs over odds, but sorta both.  That becomes a problem with the hints of Jane's affair with Jonathan, for one doesn't really know how to feel--do we understand because we're in her difficult world or do we condemn her because she'd agreed to care for Hawking and knew what she was getting into.  Overall, it reminds me of A Beautiful Mind, but not handled quite a deftly from a storytelling point of view.",1434412800,,874,4.64935064935065

6512017,5,B00LY1YOGA,"An extraordinary performance of a wonderful human being.
Stephen Hawking is the most preeminent physicist since Albert Einstein with writings such as A Brief History Of Time. The movie instead of delving too much in his professional life, focus more on his personal life and his family which turned out to be the better story. I really felt that I got to know the man behind the superstar persona and his iconic synthesized voice. You go through a journey in which he had to live with ALS, a devastating disease which can kill quickly or slowly over many years. I wonder how many people would carry on after being told they had only two years to live. Yet he moved on and had a family and continued his work. Love for his work and family has sustained him which is captured well. There many lighter moments too, like the time he got his synthesized voice. In a Dr Who moment, he impersonated a dalek.
Moving on to the performances, Redmayne delivers a performance well worth the Oscar and BAFTA award. He his completely believable and genuine in his portrayal of Hawking. To add emphasis to that, Stephen Hawking himself has noted that it seemed that he was really looking at himself when he saw the movie. I even go as far to compare his performance to be on the level of Daniel-Day Lewis. Felicity Jones delivers a strong performance as his first wife, Jane. She shows a inner strength and anguish as she shoulders a heavy burden to raise a family, pursue her career and care for Stephen.
I hope one day he does find the Theory For Everything. That would be a marvelous and proper epilogue.",1433548800,,1592,4.550522648083624

6512071,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Caught it on AD so I wasn't interested enough to see it while the Oscar buzz was on and turns out that I predicted my ""OK"" film review.  The love stories, yes there are more than one, are driven largely by the handsome leads, Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones and Charlie Cox.  Kudos to Simon McBurney for his small but memorable role as the ever so British and kind Dad.

While the story, moving at nearly warp speed, goes from a meet cute to ""I am dying"" as we are introduced to all the main characters and the relationships before the diagnosis.  It is the ""relationship of everything"" that makes this movie spin which I cannot discuss without spoilers.  I can say that Jane (Felilcity Jones) falls stalwartly in love, in a 40's kind of way (the movie is set in the 60's), after a brief and a little stiff romance.  The Hawking family scenes before and after the disease announcement are among the warmest of the entire film and reveal a very smart family where Jane is an equal.  The good looking and boyishly bashful Charlie Cox, ala Colin Firth, is pitch perfect in his performance.

The film was neither a love story, although a good deal of it is devoted to the relationships of the trio which later expand to include a fourth, nor a science story of one of the great minds of our time.

It is almost a cliche that actors playing characters with physical challenges receive award nominations, and Mr. Redmayne was no exception here either. The truly feel good moments in this film were nostalgic for the 60's era and its music and I supposed were aimed at a Baby Boomer audience.

It's okay but not substantial.",1433116800,,1616,4.5034246575342465

Eddie Redmayne very justly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Prof. Stephen Hawking. And that's in year when there were some very worthy contenders. He is simply amazing at  the showing the progressive disabilities of this disease. Felicity Jones pulls off her role as the long over-worked spouse without becoming a pathetic creature but as an admirable woman who tried very hard to make his life as 'normal' as  possible for as long as possible. All  this while raising 3 children and accomplishing her own PhD. It is uplifting and never dwells on what Prof. Hawking cannot do, only on the incredible things can and has.

6512180,4,B00LY1YOGA,"This is a very beautiful film that shows love, dedication and commitment. To fall in love so fast and be faithful so long - till death them parts - is a fairy tale, an untellable story and the film tries to tell it.

Doctors when they are confronted to a disease they do not know or understand are ready to tell you will die within two years. This film, this Stephen Hawking is the most brilliant proof that doctors' predictions, and alas sometimes their prescriptions, are useless and nonsensical. They can just not admit they do not know.

Stephen Hawking is also the proof that your body can become completely obsolete, nonreactive, dilapidated and yet your mind may keep all its power, and the first power man's mind has is to be able to choose between ending the suffering of the body before intended by nature or using his mind to its full potential till the end of time, till the natural end of his time.

As for the famous theory of the black holes, of the limitless universe in space and time, and of the big bang that starts from something that is not considered as being the beginning, which is obvious since it existed before the big bang otherwise there would not have been a big bang, I will not here discuss the few details I could discuss. For example that time is a human invention and that nature only contains duration. This is so true that we still have not been able to configure some time counting machine that would come to the perfect dimension of a second, minute, hour, day, month, year that would enable us to skip the leap years and other silly little corrections like that.

The fake debate about God or no God is just what it is a fake debate. If the universe is limitless it has no beginning point, hence it has no creator. If there is a creator somewhere we can always wonder the way Buddha used to wonder: but who in the cosmos created that God, and that opens a door that leads to so many other doors that there is no logic along that line. The myth that you can find the perfect mathematical equation that will demonstrate the big bang theory is what it is a myth that cannot anyway evade the fact that if the big bang and the universe can be described by mathematical formulas, then it is obvious this universe is logical, is rational. Can anything rational exist all by itself outside the brain of a sentient and rational being? And that cannot be man since man is so young in this universe. We can always say it is the result of the architecture of the universe and that architecture cannot stand one minute if it does not respect some balancing elements, etc.

And you see the result. My grandmother is turning over and over in her tomb and she is losing her last teeth because she is chattering with fear, she is shattered by fear.

I can very precisely explain the origin and the phylogeny of human language that started somewhere around 250,000 years ago because it is the product of a very clearly definable situation, but to look for an origin of the universe which implies the universe is not limitless, or to accept the idea that the universe is limitless which implies always is not quantifiable and forever really means forever, does not answer the question about where all that comes from.

Luckily the film avoided that level of theory and concentrated on the human side of this heroic suffering and brilliant inventiveness, though, after one rebuffing session with scientists that sees several men of science leaving the room in furor and anger before some Soviet scientist turned the wind around, it does not even hint at the fact there might be some serious objection against that theory because it is nothing but a theory, hence a model constructed by the mind of a man, the minds of a few men. Hence something that has to be taken as what it is: only a human representation of what man understands about the universe at one moment in time, one moment in man's history, and man's history is the basis of man's time.

Of course no one expects a film to give us the final truth about what we do not even know how to imagine.

I understand that a movie studio  wants to appeal to a large audience and thus does not want to go too in-depth with scientific theorems, but then again the demographic attracted to this movie is presumably much more willing and interested in some detail.",1431388800,,460,4.6419753086419755

6512361,4,B00LY1YOGA,"This is a good movie about the life of Stephen Hawking. It is more about his life at the university, marriages, family, and the progression of his disease.  He has Lou  Gehrig disease.  It is the story about a brilliant man trapped in a body that just would not cooperate with his mind. He refused to give up and struggled to still excel in using his intellect to teach others and prove his theories.  I enjoyed the film but you should know that the film is not about his scientific theories but his life.

The film had a special meaning for me in that my brother had a stroke and was paralyzed. He also was extremely intelligent and I saw him suffer in pain for many years while not being able to use his body. He too admitted that he felt trapped in a body that would not allow him to use his intellect to its maximum potential. When someone close to you has a problem like this you can really relate to the true meaning of life.

Stephen hawking is brilliant and I admire his work. I don't know how much Hollywood has changed the story but I found it entertaining and I rated it 4 stars.",1431302400,,1090,4.216346153846154

6512434,4,B00LY1YOGA,"This is primarily a love story.  The fact that it involves a very brilliant scientist makes it even more amazing.  His wife Jane also is portrayed as a very remarkable woman who not only was attracted to this nerdy man but even when confronted with the fact that he had a very progressive motor neuron disease still wanted to marry him.  It was incredible to watch as she raised three children and was also care-giver to Steven Hawking.  And the scene that really made an impact on me was when the choir director came to their house for dinner.  Because Steven at that point had difficulty speaking Jane was able to make the guest understand how quantum physics worked by using inanimate objects.  Truly she had to be not only formidable but have the intelligence to understand what her husband was doing in his work.

How Steven Hawking was able to communicate, get around, and still maintain his sanity and sense of humor was amazing.  He was diagnosed with a condition that  gave him a life expectancy of two years but nearly fifty years later he is still alive and making an impact on science.  The marriage broke up but lasted a good thirty years and both Jane and Steven found some happiness with other mates.

Eddie Redmayne definitely deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Hawking----the speech, the gestures, the increasing immobility issues, and the humor.  Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking was also stellar in that role and I believe she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  The only issue I had with this film is that the background music in the beginning when they are at a party was too loud and it was hard to hear the dialogue, but otherwise it was an awe inspiring film to see.",1430870400,,1701,4.6112956810631225

Just spent way more time on his daily habits than his groundbreaking discoveries.  I've lost friends to ALS, its a horrible fate, and I don't mean to downplay it, but I don't think people went to see this movie to see Hawking's daily routine for two hours.

Eddie Redmayne did an amazing job capturing how the illness affects the body.  Spoiler alert!  I was a little shocked that HE left his wife who had cared for him for some many years.  My sister's husband left her a year and half into the illness and remarried shortly after their divorce.  He took their son with him too.  My sister lasted 3 1/2 more years.  Dealing with a terminal illness is bad enough, but having to go through the heartache of losing a husband and child was unimaginable.

6512474,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie about Stephen Hawking.  Eddie Redmayne's acting was excellent.  Felicity Jones does an amazing job as Hawking's first wife, Jane.  This rendition focuses more on the relationship between he and Jane; the point of view is hers (it is based on the book by Jane Hawking, so this was expected). The tender, loving relationship between Jane and Stephen was brought to life through emotional scenes that exposed some of their incredible challenges as a young married couple. An educated person herself, Jane remained focused and unrelenting in her care and support for her genius husband. This biopic doesn't gloss over the fact that they divorced and remarried their assistants; it was not represented salaciously, but part of the narrative. It is obvious their relationship remained loving and intact despite the hardships and eventual separation.  If you are interested in another excellent rendition, watch BBC's 2004 ""Hawking"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch that focuses more on Hawking's early years and some of his scientific work during university years is explored more.",1430697600,,1101,5.421052631578948

I came away thinking the poignancy of Hawking's struggles with ALS had been well addressed, and that the film had done a great job showing how that heavy burden shaped his wife's life experience as well. But then it didn't do anything profound or satisfying with that theme. There was a beautiful moment when Hawking and his ex-wife are admiring the children they had together, and a sort-of dream sequence where Hawking gets out of his chair and conveys something (what, I don't know, and I'm not sure the filmmakers did, either). But there was no denoument--just a kind of sad loss of hope and a bittersweet memory of past tenderness.

It's about the incredible mind of theorist, Stephen Hawking and his descent/struggle with ALS. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking. Wow. What a performance. Of course Redmayne won an Oscar for this lovely film. I've seen him in other films (""My Week with Marilyn"" and ""Hick"") and thought - this guy has got the goods! He's a tremendous talent. His face is so expressive and he's such a dedicated and fearless actor. And let's not forget about the equally talented (and the gorgeous), Felicity Jones. Jones is breathtaking to watch as Jane, Hawkin's strong-as-nails wife. I'm so thrilled Jones is finally getting the recognition she so rightfully deserves. Her performance is both sensitive and emotionally strong. Redmayne and Jones's chemistry is electric and palpable. My only gripe is the film is a bit slow and tends to drag but overall, I found ""The Theory of Everything"" a delight to watch. It moved me to tears. Stunning film and beautifully cinematography.

I didn't expect a dissertation, but they could have, just once, explained what he did, or HOW he managed to develop his theories--they never show him actually working.  Maybe he worked with a grad student who wrote on a chalkboard?  Maybe he was able to do all the proofs in his head?  Whatever, I left the movie totally confused.

6512811,1,B00LY1YOGA,"First, anyone who has compared Redmayne to Lewis, you are insane, and I cannot address you.  Second, this is typical melodramatic linear nonsense that Hollywood loves to throw an Oscar at.  Consider ""King's Speech"" or that crap movie with Russell Crowe that Ron Howard directed about the guy who pioneered game theory.  It's bad, and it's been done before.  And...they collapse decades into a few hours which means most of the film is a montage.  Then you have Redmayne.  I have never wanted to punch an actor or anyone in my whole life.  Full disclosure, I watched this on a plane with the sound off.  But, and I mean BUT, it made the flight longer.  I'd give it at least two stars because some good people worked on this giant turd.  The costume people, the wardrobe the makeup, etc. everyone who doesn't get credit.  Out of respect for those people working for a living I give it one star.  How Keaton was passed over for this is only testament that he has offended the right people over the years.  And Hawking...he's not a hero.  Really not a hero.  He's smart.  He got a disease and that sucks.  But so do millions of other people who have contributed as much to modern physics as he.  Nothing.  He's bright, but he's no Newton.  Much less an Einstein.

6512815,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Excellent  movie. As a Christian, I was a little bit leery of it, due to the fact that I know Steve Hawkings doesn't believe in anything, but the  movie was very fair to the role Christianity, embodied by his wife and the mother of his three children, played in helping him recover from what would have been a devastating blow, and go on to have a full life and to advance in his studies and career.

6512828,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This film has flaws ... it tries to cover an immense amount of time (something Steven Hawking has studied his entire life) into a very ""brief"" film.  The result seems choppy.  You don't get enough feeling of the terribly rigorous family life; the children are not in the film very much and it seems as if they must be living somewhere else perhaps.  The principle characters simply do not age appropriately, especially Mrs. Hawking who looks around 25 through most of the film, which for someone managing such an enormous burden would be impossible.

That said, the acting was so impeccable, so brilliant, that it overcame the flaws for me.  Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones masterfully conveyed both the enormity of the catastrophe that befell Mr. Hawking and the brave young woman, Jane, who would become his wife, as well as the incredible mutual LOVE that allowed Steven Hawking to live, to persist in his intellectual quest for a unifying theory, becoming world renowned as a physicist and beloved as a person of tremendous personal endurance and good will.

Small wonder Eddie Redmayne won the Oscar for essentially ""becoming"" Stephen Hawking. The glow of kindness, compassion and humor radiating from his face reduced me to tears.  Felicity Jones certainly deserved her nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

This film is full of flaws only in not being able to encompass a lifetime in a couple of hours, but a total success in letting us understand and rejoice in the story of this man's extraordinary personal life.",1429401600,,1534,4.9186046511627906

I held back for a long time in seeing this film thinking I wasn't interested in a film about a science genius. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is actually the story of two people in love and defying amazing odds. Based on Jane Hawking's book about her life with Stephen Hawking, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING bombards us with the stark reality of a love story in crisis. She was there with him from the beginning.
A shy young lady named Jane (the gorgeous Felicity Jones) falls in love with science geek Stephen Hawking. The film is slow moving at first and seemingly uninspired. It's a ""we've seen it before""  love story between a beautiful lady and a nerdy geek.  But, suddenly, the story shifts and we are riveted to the end.  Hawking is diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Doctors give him two years to live.
Here is where the story really begins as Jane eagerly embraces a chance to spend those two years with Hawking and be by his side. But through an amazing miracle and twist, Hawking lives decades beyond his promised two years. A truly remarkable and bittersweet story emerges as Jane becomes the eternal caregiver to Hawking as well as mother to their children. Here is a rarely explored side to the Stephen Hawking story and it makes for a fascinating film. The caregiver's story is often neglected and finally we see a loving and courageous woman buckling to the stress.

Eddie Redmayne does an incredibly realistic portrayal of Hawking as his body deteriorates. Redmayne puts his soul and body into the role. This was a physically challenging role and Redmayne  portrays Hawking with sensitivity and realism.
This is a beautiful period piece that is stunning to look at. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is inspiring, heartbreaking and bittersweet but we see love overcomes all adversity...but even love has its limits in the end.",1429056000,,1964,4.795857988165681

6512947,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Wow! I've admired Stephen Hawking for a very long time. The guy's unstoppable. He doesn't quit in the face of survival odds. And in this film Eddie Redmayne was Stephen Hawking - no doubt about it.  I rented and watched this film on Easter Sunday, April 5, 2015. That morning I had chatted with a friend about atheism and he told me it cleared his head. I thought this curious and yet in this film, that's nearly exactly how Hawking explains his atheism and focus in relation to physics. I prefer the magic of belief - The Miracles - The Resurrection. I live in Southeastern Pennsylvania where there's a shrine to the Catholic Saint, Padre Pio, who had healing gifts. Stephen Hawking persistently searches for a Theory of Everything, a Holy Grail of unification. Living in survival mode with severe challenges of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS-Lou Gehrig's Disease), Hawking's greatest achievement was in the gift of friends and family. In an interview with ""Parade Magazine"" of Sunday, September 12, 2010, when asked ""If people could take just one lesson from your work or from your life, what would you want it to be?' Hawking's reply was ""Do your best."" This says it all.",1428883200,,1178,4.802955665024631

6512981,2,B00LY1YOGA,No true development really of the relationship between Stephen and Jane. It appears Jane just goes through the motions of what the script said she should do but nothing felt natural. I certainly didn't get lost in the story or see any reason Jane would love Stephen. It was more like a story line of events that lack sincerity. I will say the actor who played Hawking did an amazing job with showing a progressive disability. Everything about his character was very believable. I really respect that aspect of the film but hated the lack of character development outside of Hawking's character. I found myself just tolerating the movie towards the end.,1428710400,2,652,4.830357142857143

If you have not yet had a chance to see this biopic, I highly recommend it to you. You will learn so much about Stephen and his life, and be sure to watch all the deleted scenes, there are some gems, including his interview with the queen.

6513135,1,B00LY1YOGA,"The problem with this movie is that it downplays Stephen Hawkings' actual accomplishments and makes his love life seem much more important. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he needed all the love and support he could get, and in order to make a blockbuster you have to beef up the drama, but what about those of us who watched this movie because our love for science? Besides the most rudimentary explanation of quantum v. General relativity physics, there is virtually nothing scientifically interesting to be had in this movie. I didn't expect a discovery channel special, but the scientific aspect was so neglected that you could swap out the ""ailed physics genius"" story line for just about any other ""ailed genius"" story and get almost the same exact movie. Again, it's not like I expected a course in physics, but it would have been nice for this movie to take advantage of its subject and try to teach something besides that tired old ""love prevails"" stuff we get out of almost every movie ever. It would have been interesting to see him struggling with developing his theory and/or getting other scientists to back him. There are a few brief instances of this, but they are so detached from actual content that they just add to the sense of a shell-like drama - beautiful outside but devoid of any inner substance. It's like the studio took a story that was interesting on all levels and sucked out everything except a love story. Even his disease loses weight as the film goes on, to the point that it makes it seem as him writing a 200+ page book was easy. Do you know how long that must have taken him? This movie made it seem like a breeze. And I can't believe that yet again, an actor that played a sick person won the academy award. It's especially annoying in this case because (no offense, just being real) as the movie goes on, the actor does less and less real acting and the makeup team becomes more and more responsible for the convincing performance. Still, it is well acted on all parts, and it has some very interesting cinematography as well as great music, but the story is bare bones and devoid of substance. If you thought the subject matter would provide an interesting twist on a typical dramatic setup, think again. It didn't. But if you want A Walk to Remember where Mandy Moore doesn't die but just so happens to be a genius, then this is your movie.",1428451200,3,2378,4.545454545454546

Thankfully later in life, she found someone who loved her and she ended up in a happy marriage.  All that to say - eh....it was a good movie, interesting, portrayed our human frailties & flaws...gave insight to his life, some great acting  by both actors and all of the supporting actors, but it just didn't make our list of films we would want to own or have in our library.

The fact that he was able to portray a man that begins suffering from Lou Gehrig's to the point where he is confined to a wheelchair with the aid of a computer to help him speak was so incredible to watch. His body language and eye contact, especially with Felicity Jones who played Jane Hawking was magical. Every bit of this film is heart breaking, but at the same time it is inspiring to see that even though everything has gone wrong for a brilliant mind. It is the mind that keeps working and leads to amazing things in this man's life.

While the lighting was really beautiful and the actors charming, I didn't get the sense of any struggle in their marriage.  I didn't know anything about this marriage and was not surprised it didn't work out, but there was no depiction of what it must have been like for them to be married.  You just saw her doing various house chores and holding new babies.  I imagine she must have been incredibly overwhelmed, but you didn't really see that.  And then in one scene, it just ended.  Very anti-climactic.
I think the biggest problem with this movie was that it didn't really focus on one thing.  I wish they had focused on either his work, their marriage, or his condition.",1428019200,2,912,4.4397590361445785

6513352,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Do you remember early 2002, when a certain generic biopic won the Oscar over the mega-popular one-two punch of Moulin Rouge! and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring?  It was inevitable, we all saw it coming (or we should have) and yet the months that followed brought scorn and resentment over the Oscar winner, scorn and resentment that are still heaped upon its back.  You see, I liked A Beautiful Mind.  I still do.  Its a simple made film that follows some basic tropes that all biopics tend to fall into, and yet it was engaging and enjoyable and littered with interesting and beautiful performances.  Still, its a film that can be taken for granted and dismissed as by the books and, as I noted above, generic.

I never truly realized how good of a movie A Beautiful Mind was until I sat down to watch The Theory of Everything.

It had the comparisons running alongside it all year, many calling this 2014s A Beautiful Mind, and it was clear why, for both films were essentially stories about brilliant men saddled with a disability (one mental, the other physical) who were saved by the love of a woman.  The difference is that A Beautiful Mind actually has something to say.  While The Theory of Everything is quite beautiful to look at and has a stunning (albeit obvious and at times distracting) score, but it also doesnt tell us anything about the man in question, throws out jargon no one is going to pay attention to, and features two performances that are (while technically accurate and, at least for one, physically outstanding) quite boring and empty.

If I knew nothing about Stephen Hawking before watching this, Id know nothing more now, other than the fact that he got sick, fathered kids and didn't believe in God (or did he?).

The Theory of Everything seems pretty content with putting flashy filters all over every scene and regurgitating depictions of grief through showy edits (that call into question just how involved Redmaynes transformation really was) but never really settles down to tell us the story of this man, what hes thinking, who he isinsideapart from his crippling disability.  I understand that explaining to us Hawkings lifework would have been hard, and it would have gone over many heads, but the point of a biopic isn't really to explain a profession but an individual, and I feel as though Hawking, the man, is never cracked open for us.  We know nothing about him outside of the fact that hes smart and awkward.  We learn a great deal more about his wife, Jane, but sadly Felicity Jones is so dreadfully dull in her delivery that she may as well have not even existed.

At least when A Beautiful Mind ended (which, by the way, is nowhere near as generic as its accused of being) I felt like I knew this man and I knew his wife and I felt their love and their support and I felt his pain and I felt his growth.  When The Theory of Everything ended I felt nothing but the urge to eject the DVD.

But its pretty, you know, visually.

As far as Redmayne and his Oscar win are concerned, I get it.  I mean, from a physical aspect he really goes all out there and commands every movement, every physical deteriorating moment.  Like I said, some of the flashy edits call into question how far he went or if his performance was sliced, diced and spliced to create something that looked more incredible than it was; but regardless, he is convincing as a man suffering from ALS.  What hes not convincing as is as a man.  There is nothing behind those eyes, no real character to explore.  Its all surface, nothing genuine here.  Charlie Cox is the only person who really shines here.  Felicity Jones has the most fleshed out character but, like, she does nothing with it.

I wanted to like this.  I mean, it was getting such a thrashing from so many people who were mad that Michael Keaton lost the Oscar, and so I was hoping that it was just vitiral and nothing really warranted.  Yeah, this movie is just empty and that bleeds into every aspect of the film.  Even the cinematography is overtly showy, pretty with no real substance, and the score, which is genuinely beautiful, is used to death in a way that makes it feel cheap; like it has nothing to say.

Thats the problem here; this film has nothing to say.",1427932800,,4265,4.537254901960784

I know that wasn't the 'message' of the movie, but all the talks, books, theories, and not one tiny scene to show him calculating his conclusions.  How did Hawking do it?  And when?  He wasn't speaking well, so it would have been difficult to dictate; he couldn't write, so how did he do it?  It happened, so How?  That kind of bothered me.

I loved this movie from beginning to end and now have a very profound respect for Steven Hawking. Everything he had to go through and how he kept right on going where many would have just given up. It really puts your own life into perspective and I try to say that without sounding cliche. If Steven Hawking can do all the things he can do with his disease, all of us who are healthy, not in a wheelchair, not in a state where we need help to do life's basics, we really all have nothing to complain about.

I did a bit of reading after viewing the film and he (Hawking) really was a menace in his motorised wheelchair. One of the funniest moments in the film is Hawking/Redmayne careening around the house, paper bag on his head yelling ""Exterminate! Exterminate!"".

6513497,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I have been following Stephen Hawking's career for many years and this movie goes beyond anything I ever expected in a depiction of Hawking's life.  I can fully understand why Eddie Redmayne won the Best Actor Oscar - his performance was unbelievable.  His makeup artist nailed his appearance as Hawking both as a young man and as a world-renowned physicist in his later years.  I could not believe Redmayne could contort his body the way he did when portraying Hawking in a wheel chair.  It is my understanding that the real Hawking was so impressed by what he saw in the production footage that he permitted the producers to use the actual computer voice that he speaks with all the time.  Even in the midst of the physical incapacitation of Lou Gehrig's Disease, Hawking is portrayed as self-assured, mentally acute and still more than willing to ""explore new frontiers [with apologies to Star Trek]"" in science.  Hawking fan or not, I recommend this movie to all who admire the refusal of the human spirit to give in to physical adversity while at the same time letting the mind soar.  Hawking's body may be imprisoned in a wheel chair, but there are no fetters, shackles or obstacles that will shutter his brilliant mind.",1427587200,,1226,4.754716981132075
6513498,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Theory or Everything"" though it wasn't the story I was expecting. I anticipated learning more about Hawking's disease and his brilliant theories, but those were really just subplots to the greater plot which was his relationship with Jane and his family and colleagues. You already know by now that Eddy Redmayne's acting was superb. His physical mastery of the role was remarkable, and in many scenes, after Hawking had lost his ability to talk, Redmayne communicated simply with limited facial expressions. The scene when he and Jane decide that their marriage is over, even with very few words spoken, is heartbreaking.

It was interesting to know more about Hawking's personal life. I had no idea that he had fathered 3 children. The ending felt rather truncated and rushed though. We don't get to know that his marriage to Elaine lasted just 6 years; In fact after he announced that he was leaving Jane, we never saw Elaine again at all. The movie does ring true, however, and received the admiration and endorsement of Hawking who felt that Redmayne had captured him very well.",1427587200,,1118,4.946808510638298

The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars was that it felt a little disjointed and chronologically vague.  There were times in the movie that it seemed to move fairly slow and then other times when it would take giant leaps and it got fairly hard to follow as far as what's happening when (they don't really appear to age and the kids don't either...sort of strange).  Other than that, very good movie, but far from light-hearted (make sure you're in the mood for serious).",1427414400,,565,4.62

But the story is incoherent - there are so many missing chunks that I didn't come away knowing much about Stephen Hawking other than he is supposedly brilliant (I know he is, but I didn't get why from this movie) and his illness is tragic, except insofar as he has survived.

6513609,4,B00LY1YOGA,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING has everything you'd expect from the typical Hollywood biopic, and as such is rather predictable. Not only that, but its subject is still alive (and very famous) which robs it of a lot of dramatic tension. Still, Eddie Redmayne gives an extraordinary, transformative performance as Stephen Hawking, as does Felicity Jones as his long-suffering first wife Jane. The story starts with Hawking's years at Cambridge and up through the publication of ""A Brief History of Time."" Instead of focusing on the accomplishments, the film is really about the relationship between him and his first wife, as the book is based on her memoir. The romance kind of comes out of nowhere, but after spending two hours with them you really begin to feel for them, especially Jane, who ended up having to put in overtime as her husband's caregiver (until help was brought in). The scenes which show the gradual progress of Hawking's condition (Motor Neuron Disease/ALS) were quite moving as well, but only in the most general sense. It also ""helped"" that the score hinted at just the right moments when you were supposed to be emotionally affected. So, while the film is sure to stir up emotion and possibly provoke tears at certain points, nothing the film does with those moments is that special in and of itself. What really makes this film worth seeing is for Eddie Redmayne's performance, which deservedly won him the Best Actor Oscar this year. Of course, the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Watson, Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, does outstanding work as well. Overall, it's not particularly groundbreaking in terms of the biopic and romance formula, or in its execution, but Eddie Redmayne takes it to another level with his portrayal of one of the world's greatest living minds.",1427328000,3,1797,4.933993399339934

There are interesting techniques used in part of the film which add dimension to the story.  The story is fascinating, and will leave you thinking:  about his propositions, about life, about the challenges of a debilitating disease and beating the odds, about devotion, and about harsh reality.

For the less philosophical, it amazing on many levels, such as why is this individual able to continue living and even working when this terrible disease takes lives within months and/or short number of years after diagnosis, how does he maintain his sense of humor, how did his wife maintain her commitment to him over time, why did he let her..... don't want to ruin the movie for you all....",1426896000,,1001,4.693181818181818

I will firstly say that Redmayne was brilliant as Hawkins in the way he played the role even down to the movements of the terrible Lou Gehrigs disease.  The makeup as well for his character made him look so close to the real Stephen Hawking it was amazing.  I knew very little about his personal life but this is a well written love story that is not afraid to show the good and the bad times , the love and the loss in it while at the same time exploring the amazing resilience of the man who has survived his physical frailty against all odds while becoming a brilliant theoretical physicist.

Well done, acting, story line, characters all brillantly & touchingly done.  Extraordinary story.  His wife shoud also have received an award for her steadfastness-he probably wouldn't have lived if not for her & his great love.",1426809600,,381,5.213114754098361
6513878,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This is a fine film.  Hawkings science is noted in the course of the story and the highlights are briefly described, but the film principally concerns his relationship with his first wife, Jane.  Based on her memoir, it effectively communicates both their love and the difficulty of their situation, particularly after the arrival of their third child.

As most will know, Jane was helped with Stephens care by a man named Jonathan Jones, her choir director and sons piano teacher.  When they develop feelings for one another they separate, in fairness to Stephen.  When Stephen develops feelings for his new nurse and travels with her to the U.S., Jane and Jonathans relationship is greenlighted.  The film leaves Stephens future with the nurse vague (they married and then later divorced), Stephen and Jane remaining lifelong friends.

This is the sum and substance of the film.  The performances are consistently excellent, the atmospherics warm and foreboding, as necessary.  The film is shot with a very bluish palette.  Whole scenes seem to consist of blue grass, blue trees and blue buildings.

The film is perhaps 20-30 minutes longer than it needs to be.  Caveat emptor with regard to Hawkings science.  The film gives it short shrift; this is a love story and a representation of the effects of SHs disease, not a complete biography.",1426809600,8,1343,5.02262443438914

6513880,4,B00LY1YOGA,Excellent movie. My only problem and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the difficulty in understanding the dialog. Closed Captions were not available and British accents are often difficult to understand but this movie had the additional complication of his mumbling because of his affliction with ALS. Subtitles should have been provided for much of the movie.,1426809600,,367,5.133333333333334

I didn't know they only gave him a few months to live and now he is 73. I did not know he was married, had a family and even has grandchildren. I looked him up online to find out more about him. My son was diagnosed with a disease at 28 and lost his ability to walk among other things. His life is also said to be shortened. He is on a quest to heal himself or find a healer. The movie gave me hope and courage..I spoke of it with my son also. All the above make this a great and memorable movie.",1426809600,,605,3.8095238095238093

6513883,4,B00LY1YOGA,"If you are looking for a biopic about why Stephen Hawking is a physics genius, this isn't it. The Theory of Everything is more about his marriage. I don't think you have to know squat about physics or Stephen Hawkings to appreciate a story about how a bright young woman meets an awkward young man and commits to him even after she finds out that he has a degenerative disease that will take his ability to move before it takes his life in two years or less. Is it true? I hear that it's not and actually it feels VERY white washed because no one is THAT good. No marriage is that trouble-free- especially with the stressors that those two had. But is that the point of the movie? I don't think so. But, does it leave you with the feeling inspired and good all over? Yes, it did for me.

On a side note, I LOVE that Eddie Redmayne is getting the attention from Hollywood that he deserves. He's a fine actor. I am glad he's getting the roles that prove it. Although Harry Lloyd didn't have a huge part, it was fabulous seeing him too. Here's the the second British invasion. I hope Hollywood is taking note and will continue hiring talent over pretty fluff.",1426723200,,1156,4.3271889400921655

6513914,3,B00LY1YOGA,"As a faith believer my review is influenced by who I am. Though I was very impressed with the love story and the devotion of Wilde to her husband in this impossible situation for any family and how they together through their love for each other overcame insurmountable odds it always amazes me how much credibility is given to what is essentially a guess and an opinion proposed by a scientist which is no better than the doctrines of faith proposed by religion.
There is no conclusive proof by either as to how life began. Both offer what they consider the substance of their arguments but without the full scientific process which is supposed to establish an indisputable conclusion it is not a fact and yet global warming, the theory of evolution and any number of scientific opinions are applied by our society from scientists (the high priest of secular society) as if they are proven facts when they are not.
A large number of scientific theories on life, the existence of the cosmos or the human health have been shown to be wrong and reassessed after many years of our society living by those theories until someone one days examines their claims and finds them unsubstantiated.
So though I found the story inspiring, interesting and thought provoking on one level on another it is just another effort from the antagonists of faith to undermine faith and empower themselves on the gullibility of most people, especially people who are looking for just another excuse to attack religion so that they can justify themselves in living outside of the bounds and responsibilities of ethical and moral behavior.",1426723200,,1614,4.851449275362318

That's saying something, but there was nothing else about it that I really liked.  It took us through too much of what was going on with him personally.  I would have preferred they illustrated why he thought Time was such an interesting subject, what was going on in the world that lead him there, what was his home and family like...

extraordinary individuals. Felicity Jones is also marvelous as Hawking's long-suffering and heroic

All in all, I think the film is one of the stronger historical adaptations, mixing everyday meaning and drama with an unusual affliction and a monumental life.  No film can ever be completely true-to-life, but I thought there was respect here for both the subject and the viewers.

6514078,5,B00LY1YOGA,"*Watched this on the Japan Airlines flight so it doesn't show up as verified purchase but I loved it so much, I must review it.*

The performance of Eddie Redmayne was brilliant - if you watch for no other reason, watch to see him perform. Felicity Jones was incredible too. The story of Stephen Hawking fascinates me. I started to read ""A Brief History of Time"" years ago and my head started to hurt - our universe is so old, so big, and we as human being so small, so insignificant, such little blips in the ocean of time and space. It was hard to keep going but after watching this movie, I feel inspired to read it again - or attempt to do so at any rate.

My favorite scenes of the movie are below:
1. When he is first diagnosed with his disease and he wants to know if the brain gets affected too - his relief that the brain remains intact and functional.
2. When his bride confides in Stephen's father that she may seem weak but she is a strong woman and she loves Stephen and wants to be with him. no matter how long they may have.
3. When he shows up for his PhD certification and hears the team of professors comment on his work.
4. When he is looking at his three grown children and looks over to his wife, saying, ""Look at what we created together."" The miracle of parenthood surpassing even his own work in that moment.

The movie is one of the best I have seen - it touches you on so many levels and made me appreciate - on a whole new level - my ability to function normally and have full use of all my body parts and to feel more compassion towards those who suffer from terrible diseases such as Lou Gherig's. And it made me appreciate the work and dedication of Stephen Hawking to science and advancement of human knowledge so much more. Watch it and be awe-inspired!",1426550400,2,1785,4.213450292397661

6514122,5,B00LY1YOGA,"A fascinating movie, both for the personal story and for the glimpses into the lives of geniuses.  Everything is quite understated, making everything quite beautiful.  Had to watch twice.  The answer to the last question in the last scene of the film was especially moving:  the acknowledgement that human beings and human nature are limited, and because this is so, human nature wants something without limits.  This is apparently what S. Hawking showed scientifically - how the universe has no boundaries, has no limits.  As I learned in my catechetical studies when a young person, and as J. Hawking apparently believed, God is everywhere present, is all knowing, and is all powerful - in other words has no boundaries or limits.
So how or why need there be controversy?  As Robert Frost says:  ""Having ideas that are neither pro nor con is the happy thing.  Get up there high enough and the differences that make controversy become only the two legs of a body the weight of which is on one in one period, on the other in the next.""  In God's house are ""many mansions"":  some are merely scientific, some are merely religious, but with the grace of art and imagination, some participate in an interchange of both.",1426550400,,1215,4.76555023923445

6514195,2,B00LY1YOGA,"Eddie Redmayne won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance, which is well worth seeing, but the rest of this film was a letdown for me. No doubt out of respect for avoiding lawsuits from the still living subjects, the film is sanitized to an extreme. For example, there is no attempt to show the sort of day-to-day drudgery his wife must have experienced. After all, the man could not properly attend to himself in the bathroom, brush his teeth, or do any of the dozens of small day to day activities we take for granted. Yet the only visual evidence we are given for his wife's growing disenchantment is her difficulty in completing her thesis on Iberian poetry, because Hawking is in the next room using his electric wheelchair to horse around with the children. The man she eventually cheats with is presented as an almost cartoonish paragon of goodness and virtue, while the caretaker Hawking cheats with is portrayed as some sort of snake in the garden. The whole infidelity thing unfolds like a slow motion train wreck: you can see it coming, but it takes a while for the movie to get where you've been for the past hour.
The filmmaker's use of color is distracting, bathing some scenes in warm orange light as if the actors were under the heat lamp at McDonalds, while other scenes are done in a washed out blue. For a situation that seems so fraught with emotion, this is a very tepid drama. No one is to blame you see, and we're all veddy English.",1426464000,,1458,4.547528517110266

6514235,5,B00LY1YOGA,This is such a powerful and inspiring film that you should see whenever you are feeling overwhelmed and/or unmotivated. If Stephen Hawkings can live and continue his life full speed ahead with Lou Gehrig's disease then anyone else should follow his lead.,1426291200,,254,5.071428571428571
6514236,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Good film, but not great. An almost similar film is The Imitation Game which was several leagues better than ToE. Side note: Hawkings theory is a popular theory about the beginning of the universe, but not generally accepted by contemporary cosmology. See Vilenkin: ""But in 2003, a team including Vilenkin and Guth considered what eternal inflation would mean for the Hubble constant, which describes mathematically the expansion of the universe. They found that the equations didn't work (Physical Review Letters, DOI: 10.1103/physrevlett. 90.151301). You cant construct a space-time with this property, says Vilenkin. It turns out that the constant has a lower limit that prevents inflation in both time directions. It cant possibly be eternal in the past, says Vilenkin. There must be some kind of boundary.",1426291200,,810,5.3858267716535435

But Jane and Stephen are divorced, after all, much as this film tries to downplay the split.  Hollywood has a history of whitewashing all our cultural heroes.  That's not exactly a bad thing.  Society needs its icons.  Still...I'm not sure it was necessary to candy-coat this couple's relationship.  They were fighting an incredible battle together and facing extreme challenges.  Clearly neither one of them has any interest in denigrating the other.  That's nice, but the hasn't truth become muddled in their discretion?  What are we to take away from it all?

6514376,5,B00LY1YOGA,"You'd pretty much have to be living in a cave to not know about Stephan Hawking and the remarkable impact he's made on physics, while having done so under the most extreme of afflictions. Here is a great chance to examine him in clearer detail.

Here's the scoop. Taken from Hawking's ex-wife's book, this movie takes the viewer through Stephen's life just prior to meeting her, the onset of his A.L.S. and how they dealt with it as they both carve out their careers.

Everything great you might have heard about this film is absolutely true. Movies simply do not get much better than this. Start with a great script by screenwriter and book author Anthony McCarten. Supplement that with outstanding performances by the likes of Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones and a host of other veterans. Then add the adroit directing by James Marsh and everything comes together in a glorious whole. This is a great film. Though it will pull on your emotions it doesn't come from cheap manipulation of the audience. It comes from circumstance itself. Redmayne doesn't solicit 'poor me. poor me' from the audience (though there is some of that at the onslaught of the illness). He spends much of the time trying to work around it. He manages to maintain a certain amount of charm and humor. It IS more of a triumph than anything. Yes. Things are tough but I felt great when it was over. This is not a downer flick.

See it. It is well worth your time and money.",1426032000,,1446,4.596899224806202

I couldn't help thinking the real story wasn't as pretty. Eddie Redmayne is a really likable actor. Congrats to him! Without him I would have given it a 3. I think that is because the character development seemed so thin. I didn't learn anything. It seemed like a view from the outside. A view I already had.

6514790,3,B00LY1YOGA,"I found this film to be the least likely film to be nominated for the academy award. Too much is unexplained. Example 1: While at Cambridge in 1963 Hawking is diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. The film gives no explanation how he has survived so long. Example 2: The theory of everything could have been explained better so that the average viewer could have been better drawn into the mind of Hawking. I would have loved to see a short FX scene demonstrating the birth of our Solar System from a Black Hole, with narration by Hawking would have helped immensely.  Example 3: I say; Hawking saw that his wife needed more than he could possibly give her and decided to make the break with his wife by pretending to be in love with his caregiver. My wife says: Stephen Hawking is a jerk. After all his wife did for him, he decided to leave her for someone else. Perhaps the book is more clear on these questions but the movie should have been... My wife came away from this film caring less about Stephen Hawking than before... and I have to agree.

I can give you my theory of what this film is about: The disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), aka; Lou Gehrig's Disease and the hardship it causes the people who have it and the loved one's around them. This film offers little else in the way of substance and certainly could have been told without Stephen and Jane Hawking. It is neither a Historical piece, a scientific exploration or, as the film has many inaccuracies can't even be labeled a proper biography.

As far as Academy Awards go, Redmayne did a wonderful job impersonating Hawking, but should simple impersonation really translate to Best Performance of the year by an actor?
I thought Michael Keaton (Birdman) was robbed. Also Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game) who's performance of that other Cambridge genius Alan Turing was mesmerizing.",1425859200,,1881,4.676737160120846

My problem and the reason it is just 3 stars is I took 4 away before added two for the acting.  This was a plain to see Oscar bait movie that didn't know what it wanted to be except try to win Oscars.  Thank goodness the Academy seen through that and only gave it the best actor oscar.  Yes, Stephen Hawking is a compelling person and his story would be great movie to see but this was not the one.  It doesn't know what angle the movie wants to protray the story, is it a heartache story of a severely physically disabled husband who wants his wife to be happy and the loving wife who secretly suffers from not having a fully functioning husband, or is it a brilliant man and his theories no matter the limitations caused by disease with his wife who supports him beyond most would.

He was so good that we almost forgot that he was an actor portraying a character and not Stephen himself. We, a bunch of us, highly recommended this movie.  Enjoy!",1425859200,,410,5.08955223880597
6514796,4,B00LY1YOGA,"Hawking is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, an actor who's deserved his chance to shine for a long time now. His performance is nothing short of beauty, especially considering the movie was filmed out of sequence. His ability to show the many stages of Hawking's illness is remarkably impressive. Felicity Jones' performance as Hawking's wife Jane is equally impressive as we watch her struggle to maintain her husband's condition.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not so adept. The film plays out like the very mathematical equations in which its subject envelopes himself. It almost feels like a TV movie in its formulaic sympathy. That's not to say it isn't a tragic story, but its telling did little for me.

For the first two-thirds or so, the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: A touching story of a seemingly doomed affair, or a bold statement on Hawking's theories. Ultimately it succeeds at neither, amounting to a light, safe, almost entirely forgettable romantic drama. Even the score, which has been winning countless awards this season, I found indistinguishable from any number of films of the same ilk.

I really hate the term ""Oscar Bait,"" but if a movie were to define it, this would be the one. Its only salvation is the performances of its leads, who seem to be the only ones giving the film any heart.",1425859200,,1336,4.774891774891775

He was fabulous...in what had to have been a most difficult part to play!!  Well, he did it!  I also have to say what a remarkable man Dr. Hawking must be.  It appears he has gone through a lot of this keeping his sense of humor in tact.  And, that he is still alive shows me (ironically) that God definitely had a purpose for this man.  He certainly did not let ""life"" stop him.  I am still shaking my head in amazement at what Hawking has done with his life.  I'm now reading his first wife's book.  She was, I have to say also, an amazing woman.  Raising three children and attending to his every need...she has earned that star in heaven.  Still puzzled why he wanted to marry Elaine - and now I read that she (allegedly) treated him very badly...she was after money and fame, that's all.",1425772800,,933,4.293103448275862

6514826,5,B00LY1YOGA,"When I first contemplated watching this movie, I thought to myself, ""But how can it be a romance when we already know they get divorced later in life?""

But I was intrigued...and I watched it...and I must say despite the fact that Jane and Stephen get divorced later, that this is a story about love. There are many different kinds of love and you can love someone one way and later find you love them another way. You don't stop loving them; your love just changes. I think this movie should have been called The Evolution of Love. I do.

The movie starts in 1962(3?) Cambridge and we meet a young student Stephen who is working on his PhD and Jane who is majoring in some kind of poetry. I saw something special in Jane right away. This is a girl/woman is one tough cookie. The girl Jane does not take no for an answer. When she finds out her boyfriend has only two years to live, when Stephen's own family warns her she should walk away now, she sticks to her guns. She's going to marry the man she loves and enjoy what times she has with him.

Woman Jane is amazing. She has to juggle small children as well as an invalid Stephen, so it's like having a grown kid on top of the little kids. I don't mean this in an insulting way, but she has to dress him and feed him and all that, and it's obvious she has her hands full and for many years her husband refused to hire outside help.

And you can tell at times that she's unhappy but she's hanging in there. And she's faced with some difficult choices. And she never breaks down.

She does not walk away until Stephen basically tells her to. And then finally she's permitted to find her own happiness.

And yet she still loved him; her love just evolved into a different type.

There are parts of the movie dedicated to Stephen's theories. I didn't understand much of it. It confused me, to be honest. If you are proving your theory from a few years ago wrong now...what makes this theory right? And why are theories so applauded when they're constantly proved wrong? It's all very confusing to me. Thankfully the movie didn't expand on that stuff too much. I may have blown a brain fuse.

But I really enjoyed this movie, the settings, the acting...omg, the acting was something. I applaud them all, especially the actor who played Stephen. And I walk away from the sofa now with a new thought planted in my head...as long as there is life, there is hope.

I bought this movie expecting a romance or a dramatic biography about the famous physicist, but I think Jane's strength stole the show.",1425686400,2,2545,4.375

The universal acclaim makes me wonder if film reviewers get paid to praise films. Eddie Redmayne delivers a good performance. However, he is not Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot (he deserved his Oscar in 1990). Eddie didn't completely transform himself they way Steve Carell did in ""Foxcatcher"". After ""Savage Grace"" in 2007 Eddie Redmayne needed to have his SAG card revoked. The script if full of holes and it doesn't cover the fact that Hawking dumped his wife and mother of his children for his nurse after like 30 years of marriage and 3 kids. Clearly everyone in Hollywood wants to keep the big UK tax incentive credit for film makers going so honoring Eddie with Best Actor was a way to recognize that special relationship. That is the only possible explanation for his winning Best Actor.",1425600000,2,908,4.753164556962025

Now that we've seen it, we completely understand why Eddie Redmayne won.  His characterization of Stephen Hawking was outstanding, both physically and dramatically.  My only complaint is that for the first 15 minutes, we could hardly understand a word; between the accents and the sound recording and editing, it was very frustrating.  After that, though, we were fine with it.  The entire cast did an excellent job, which just confirmed out belief that the arts should never be a competition.  Highly recommended.",1425600000,,628,5.1683168316831685
6514834,4,B00LY1YOGA,"A remarkable story about a very remarkable man.
Eddie  Redmayne gives an outstanding performance as Hawking, portraying him as he gradually progresses from a brash college student to a totally helpless cripple, but retains his brilliant intellect. Felicity Jones also delivers a moving performance as the woman who marries him, knowing his diagnosis and probable future, becomes the mother of his children, and then becomes his caregiver.
I always wondered why Hawking divorced Jane after she was so devoted to him all those years. The movie offers the explanation that he let her go to pursue a more normal life, and married his nurse, who had the skills to care for him. I guess that was not successful, either, as they also later divorced.",1425600000,,742,4.983870967741935

This movie isn't great--it plods forward through Hawkings' life from one point to another point at the same steady pace. There's nothing suspenseful, and even his moments of insights seem pedestrian. The narrative avoids dwelling on his intellectual achievements, counting on his gradual physical decay to drive the story (ironically, in a very linear timeline). Redmayne (and no doubt there was a team behind him, helping him get the expressions and postures correct) deserves his accolades, though--it was easy to forget that he was an actor playing the part and that this wasn't somehow Hawking himself.",1425427200,,690,5.281818181818182

If you, like myself, are expecting to see more of a biographical take on Dr. Hawking's work and achievements as the world's eminent physicist, you may be let down. This story follows the story of Dr. Hawking (who is more than beautifully portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, who deserves every bit of his recent academy award for it) from an almost marriage counseling perspective as opposed to a celebration of his mind and contributions.  It illustrates the initial blossom of love, loyalty and dedication the couple has to their marriage, but also the trials, temptations and hardships associated with that relationship when life events suddenly and drastically change the face of each persons' world. It minimally focuses on Dr. Hawking's success and offers more screen time to his physical struggle with his disease and its' connection to his family.

6515081,5,B00LY1YOGA,"The intense, heartstrong, tragic saga of Professor Stephen Hawking, who succeeds professionally despite the personal and physical tolls of an early-onset ALS diagnosis. It handles the subject remarkably well, placing us in the wheelchair right beside him throughout his physical descent. When he aches, struggling with staircases, obligations and words alike, we hurt along with him. We fall head over heels for Hawking's relationship with his young love, Jane Wilde, only to watch their spark slowly flicker amidst the trials of his condition and increasing social status. It's a bittersweet combination of enduring hope and crushing loss. Beautifully shot and superbly acted, particularly in the two lead roles, this is a wonderful encapsulation of the vibrancy of a life well-lived. Well worth watching, it's sure to move you in many different ways, and maybe even make you think twice about what you've unsuspectingly put your own loved ones through.",1425254400,,954,5.409395973154362

Maybe subtitles would have helped while Dr. Hawking would speak, towards the middle of the movie. I did not agree with the director and the filming lens chosen. Maybe he thought it would give the correct time period. I felt that I needed to clean the fog or dust from the screen. The glare was distracting as well. The picture quality did improve as the movie continued. Other than that constructive criticism, I thought the movie was enjoyable. The plot and storyline was real and wonderful. I loved how the director wanted to show us Dr. Hawking. Both how others saw him and what he saw through his own eyes. The movie was better and better as it moved along.

The supporting cast is likewise uniformly excellent-- my minor quibble is that I would've liked to have found out more about the treatments he received during the first years of his illness (he was initially given only 2 years to live by doctors in 1964 or 65).

However, I do feel that it was a bit formulaic in showing the life story of a person with ALS and though I understand this was a major factor in Steven Hawking's life, I am not that interested in his struggles there, and I suspect neither is he. I would have liked the movie to focus more on his internal struggles (I assume there were many) with trying to prove his theories. Essentially, the story became more about his ALS than his achievements. Perhaps that was the intention all along?

If it weren't for the incredible performance by Eddie Redmayne I think the critics would have been tougher.

There was so much we never learned about how Hawking was able to understand things few people can  How did he function in a body that should have caused his death 50 years ago. How was the connection of these two people able to survive so long? Frustrating.",1425168000,2,656,4.32520325203252

Such an incredible life as is Stephen Hawking that to accomplish all that film makers have done, from the full production team; screen-play, direction, cinematograpy, crew and cast, and the score. It was a bit romanticized, but does not fail Hawking in any way in his horrendous realization of the full prognosis and effects of motor neutron, and how, with Jane's determination and love, he overcame all odds, the inevitable dissolution of that marriage, his relentless research, which continues today, 52 years after he was told at 21 that he'd only 2 years to live. The film does not dwell on the anguish of the first marriage break-up and doesn't address at all the acrimony of his second. It is a concise brilliant study of this amazing man and is portrayed by a brilliant young actor.

6515272,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Excellent movie with heartbreaking portrayals of two people who refused to let others define their potential for success.  Though difficult to watch at times, I was struck by the many themes covered such as how society looks away when others are disabled, and how many believe there is no other option for the disabled but to end their suffering, and therefore that of those who may love them.  This is a true love story, not neat, uplifting or romantic, but a portrayal of the deepest love one can imagine, and two people who defied the odds to find it.  I would recommending watching it with subtitles enabled, however, as some of Stephen Hawking's dialogue is difficult to understand once the ALS has taken hold, and you won't want to miss the wry, sensitive and charming humor of this amazing man.",1425081600,,801,4.707142857142857

Eddie Redmayne really is spectacular in this but I have not seen the other Oscar nominees. Felicity Jones' performance is wonderful and the movie would have been as good were it not for her.

This is his best role yet, a remarkable embodiment -- not just a performance -- as Stephen Hawking.  The script is excellent & the entire film is enthralling, if you like BBC-types of stories & sets & period costumes.  However, the supporting cast is not on the same level as Redmayne; they're competent, but not brilliant and moving, as he is.  Wife # 1 is particularly dull & miscast, but soon-to-be Wife # 2 is the best of the lot, as is David Thewlis as his professor, later his colleague.

This movie is not so much about his science and his theories as it is about his life and his personality, and watching Eddie Redmayne portray Hawking is worth twice the price of admission.

For me, the mark of a good movie is catching myself thinking about it for days or weeks afterwards, and ""The Theory of Everything has lingered in my head ever since I watched it.",1424995200,5,527,4.739130434782608

I have always had to take a leap of faith with Prof Hawking and accept his genius because I know next to nothing about his field of expertise - I am still none the wiser having watched this film. His sense of humour comes across very well. Redmayne's portrayal makes him very likeable. I am not sure if this is because Redmayne is a sweet, nice chap or if Hawking is as well. It is entertaining nonetheless. I truly don't know how Redmayne managed to pull off the disabilities and how much was down to computer wizardry but it is still pretty amazing and realistic. The only negative for me was Jane falling in love with the simpering wimp Jonathan - I am not sure of course if the real life Jonathan is the same having never met him. I thought the way he ended up with Jane was a little ungallant and cowardly and that reflects badly on Jane's character too for me.",1424822400,,943,4.363636363636363

No serious, in-depth treatment of Hawking's illness, marital problems, or supposedly earth shaking theory are offered which was a big disappointment to me.

instead, the director tries to force emotion from the audience by substituting relentless swells of schmaltzy music to jerk our tears rather than giving us a real story.",1424736000,15,497,4.975903614457831

6515743,2,B00LY1YOGA,"I know I will be in the minority here but I cannot a good conscious give this movie a great review. I am a huge Stephen Hawking fan and while I definitely believe that the best actor Oscar should go to this movie I also believe one should not confuse a great performance with a great film.

In my view this is a tragic missed opportunity to tell an amazing story. The scenes here are rapidfire one after the next and tell an almost movie-of-the-week like biopic treatment of Mr. Hawking's life. There is virtually no drama or conflict and at no point do I feel like I am sitting on the edge of my seat wondering ""oh my God how is he going to get out of this?""

I kind of get the feeling like one is almost not allowed to give this movie a bad review because to do so is to somehow be disparaging of Mr. Hawking himself. But I'm going to risk that pie in the face and say that indeed the emperor here is naked. Mr. Hawkins is a great physicist who has contributed great things to this world. It is unfortunate that Hollywood could not use it skills to produce a movie that matches his contributions.

If you have no knowledge or background on Mr. Hawking's life and want to see a wrote, pat, description of the progression of his life then this movie is a good place to start. However, if you are looking for deep intellectual insight into what it is like to be a person who suffers a serious physical disability on the outside while having the mind of God on the inside, well, then this movie is going to disappoint you. It offers no spiritual insight whatsoever.

6515746,4,B00LY1YOGA,"The Oscars have been awarded and Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor for his astonishingly fine performance as Stephen Hawking. For those interested in learning more about the extraordinary mind of this physicist and his contributions to science, do not expect to be enlightened. The story is more a love story adapted from his first wife Jane Hawking's book TRAVELING TO INFINITY: MY LIFE WITH STEPHEN  as adapted for the screen by Anthony McCarten. Were it not for the struggle with ALS that is depicted from the onset to the present (Hawking is 72 years old at present) and the manner in which both Hawking and Jane adjusted to this deteriorating disease, this could have been another soap opera a la Nicholas Sparks, but the actors involved make it work, aided of course by the direction of James Marsh.

One summary offers the synopsis well: `The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) , and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) the arts student he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s. Little was expected from Stephen Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age. He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children. Over the course of their marriage as Stephen's body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives: Stephen remarried Elaine mason (Maxine Peake) and Jane remarried Jonathan Hellyer Jones (the very fine actor Charlie Cox). The others in the large cast who deserve mention include David Thwelis as Stephen mentor and friend, Simon McBurney as Stephen's father, and a quick little walk on by Emily Watson.

The film does not fail to touch us because of the diagnosis and the performances, but it would have been stronger had more of Hawking's contributions been shared. Grady Harp, February 15",1424736000,5,2182,4.907859078590786

Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking has been nominated for Best Actor for the Oscar as well as the Golden Globes.

I must admit I never paid much attention to Hawking until he appeared and was referenced to frequently in ""The Big Bang Theory"" and he began to intrigue me so I was eager to get the movie when it came out.  It made him really come to life.  It begins with him as a young man in college who falls in love with a woman and then receives what seems to be a death sentence.  I'm not a big crier, but I kept finding my throat tightening and my eyes getting teary at what that remarkable man went through and even more how much his wife loved and supported him.  There aren't many minds like his, it's true.  But there don't seem to be many women who have the strength and deep love like Jan did.

At the end be is listed at being 72 years old.  At the age of 20 or 21, he was given 2 years to live.  I really think that wouldn't have happened without Jane loving him and helping him and fighting so hard for him.

Yes, this is about Stephen, but Jane is the one who really shines through.

Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have done an incredible job in portraying these two remarkable people.

I do recommend seeing this.  I'm glad I did.",1424563200,2,1163,4.161434977578475

6515840,5,B00LY1YOGA,Incredible insight to a. 20th century genius who overcame  physical limitations beyond belief to have a family and awake our beliefs about our universe -/-- totally astounding----a video biography for the ages,1424476800,,209,5.53125
6515841,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Good films can hold my attention even when I have very little interest in the subject matter. I'm sure that most people have heard of Stephen Hawking, but I doubt that many of us think too deeply about what he has achieved. His synthesized voice appeared on Pink Floyd's Division Bell and he featured on an episode of Star Trek Next Generation, but what is he like as a person?

The Theory of Everything answers that question and provides insight about how life would be if we lost the power to walk and talk without mechanical assistance.

You might imagine that Hawking's story is dry and boring. After all, he's a scientist, and they just think about mathematics, don't they? I am happy to say that this film deserves its five Oscar nominations and is anything but boring. At its very heart, The Theory of Everything is a romance, but this is a moving story with moments of comedy. By the end of the film, you will be inspired and uplifted, if you care about any other human beings at all.

At the beginning of the film, Hawking (Redmayne) is young and socially awkward. He meets Jane (Jones) at a party and gets her phone number. He's obviously intelligent, but it's his charm that impresses Jane. Redmayne's performance shows Hawking as a likeable and humorous man. When we learn of his disease, we feel something. However, Jane is not deterred by his gloomy prognosis. The two decide to marry and make the most of whatever time they can have together.

Time is another important theme in the story. As Hawking impresses his Cambridge University professor (Thewlis) with his theories about time and the universe, I couldn't help contemplating my own existence. The film made me realize that everyone has a chance to contribute something to the world. In some ways I feel ashamed that I have wasted much of my own life with trivial matters.

I won't reveal any more of the story, but I want to emphasize how good the film is. It made me think of The King's Speech and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and that's a huge compliment. Jones and Redmayne have good chemistry and their relationship seems real.

If you are worried that the subject matter may be too depressing, I think it's safe to say that the overall feel is uplifting. Yes, you will see some of Hawking's struggles, but you'll also understand the immensity of his achievements.

Where there is life, there is hope.

Hawking reportedly approves of the film and commented that Redmayne's performance was so good that he felt he was seeing himself on the screen. I have to agree that it is an excellent performance.

Too many movies cater to audiences that demand instant gratification and thrills. The Theory of Everything will make you think and feel something. Ultimately, you will remember the story and take something from it if you are the type of person who likes to think beyond the immediate moment.

6515877,5,B00LY1YOGA,"""The Theory of Everything""is a beautiful story of love, brilliance, resilience, loss and forgiveness. Whether or not the Stephen Hawking character finds out about his disease in a fall in a hall or, as reported, elsewhere is of little consequence.  The important thing is terrific acting that shows us what the real Stephen Hawking must have felt.  It is through brilliant character development that viewers can vicariously experience how tragedy can be conquered by powerful thinking and brave determination.  I hope the actors, particularly, Eddie Redmayne are recognized for
this tour de force.

Aside from my raves for the acting and, I should mention as well, the fine  writing of the book and script, it was tremendously refreshing to see a film that is not about killing, hate, gratuitous violence and men in silly costumes that belie reality or girls trying to catch a man or vice versa.  I'm happy to go to the theatre to see  science made understandable and even sexy instead of being dumbed down by a date film or, as I said, a glorification of violence.

Well done, Hollywood.  Thanks for this one.",1424390400,150,1110,4.893048128342246

It reminds me that no biography or film will be complete or perfect. The acting was nothing less than extraordinary. The pathos of the illness of ALS is there, and the eccentricities of Hawkings don't really allow for idealization, but it helps to have a picture of the man, his ideas, his loves and his egocentricities and even immaturities.

The film is two hours, but so much happens in that time. It paces fast, so things never lag and allow you to get bored.  There are so many emotional moments throughout.  I will admit to getting teary-eyed way more times than I would have expected.

If you don't believe me, record any random movie from Lifetime (aka the man-hater channel), change the names to Steven Hawking and Jane Hawking, and wallah, The Theory of Everything. It's a shame that the character of such a remarkable person was compromised for a movie about triangular relationships.

6515943,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Quick Story Recap:  The life of Steven Hawkings from healthy student to deteriorating man to famous scientist.  There were touching moments of his life and how he overcame obstacles.  Sometimes the movie gets boring but I'm not the type to read a science magazine so maybe that's just me.

The acting of Eddie Redmayne who played Steven Hawking was superb. It's facilitating to watch him believably change from an awkward young man to the brilliant yet wheelchair bound scientist.  There was a lot of sexual tension throughout the movie which is a compliment to actors chemistry between Jane Wilde, by Felicity Jones, and Jonathon Hellyer, by Charlie Cox.

Overall, it's an ok movie.  The first half I was trying to figure out what made this movie remarkable enough for an Oscar nomination.  It took half a movie but when Eddie Redmayne changed on screen and the touching moments of his transformation and succeeding in life subsequently - that's when I saw it.  There is a nice speech he gives near the end that I enjoyed hearing. The film gets inspiring bur it just lacks something, beyond the performance I mentioned, it had no real punch.

6515948,5,B00LY1YOGA,"James Marsh directs from the screenplay (Anthony McCarten) which is based on the book by Jane Hawking; ""Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen"". The movie concentrates heavily on their short courtship and subsequent marriage along with all that they endure together in their relationship. Meeting at a party at Cambridge in 1963, the chemistry between Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), a cosmologist, English theoretical physicist and author who is then trying to prove that the universe has a beginning and an end, and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), studying medieval Spanish poetry, was clear to see. While this film explains the story of their family connections from Jane's point of view, I found it to be a love story straight away. We are only shown a short romance before their marriage although it is quite clear where they are heading.

It is at the age of twenty-one that symptoms are beginning to be displayed in Stephen conducive to his early diagnosis similar to ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Like Lou Gehrig's Disease which is a complicated motor neuron degeneration causing havoc within his body and a myriad of manifestations. His voluntary muscles begin to corrupt and wither, then most of his movement does become uncontrollable; swallowing, talking, walking, anything that would involve manual dexterity, even breathing are all affected. Along with many other issues, this will include paralysis. Before long, Stephen Hawking is wheelchair bound and is in need of constant care. His mind is not affected whatsoever which makes for the frustrating state of being aware of what is happening to his body without having the ability to do anything about it. When diagnosed, he is given a prognosis of two years although Stephen Hawking is quite exceptional. He doesn't show anger or volatility, but a constant amiable personality along with an ease in what could be humorous situations for him. Eddie Redmayne demonstrates this brilliantly, possibly the best physical portrayal that I have seen.

While Stephen's father tells Jane at the time that ""This is going to be a very heavy defeat for all of us"", Jane reassures Stephen, ""No matter how much time we've got, we will spend it together"". Apparently, Jane is made of much tougher stuff than had been believed of her at first. Stephen now changes his concentration of study to the 'Theory of Everything' and a universe without boundaries. This couple moves through having three children together, defying the odds year after year and building a bond with the love that they share, no matter how rocky the family unit does get. I could go on about all of the content in the movie, but it is far better to view for yourself the family life of the Hawkings.

Eddie Redmayne is absolutely dynamic portraying Stephen Hawking, his all-consuming portrayal deserves so much praise. A scene at the end of the film just blew me away. An imagining by Hawking shows he is able to do something that is physically impossible at the time which made it all the more astounding and beautiful to behold. Felicity Jones portrays a wife who goes through the changes by making the necessary adjustments including all of the stages that take place with her husband and in her private life. Definitely a real-life and emotional love story as I viewed it, including the fullness of lush music (J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson) that rises and swells at all the right times.

6515958,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This crowd pleasing biopic of physicist Stephen Hawking, a sort of cross between A Beautiful Mind and My Left Foot, is glossy but is also hard to dislike. Hawkings life story is by now known by most people  struck by the terrible and incurable motor neuron disease in 1963 when he was a Ph. D. student in physics at Cambridge University, and told he had just two years to live, he decided nevertheless to go ahead with his life, marry his girlfriend Jane (played wonderfully here by the sweet petite Felicity Jones) and become a world renowned theoretical physicist exploring subjects such as the nature of time and black holes. 52 years later, he is still alive, though virtually immobile and trapped in a wheelchair, communicating through a computer.

This movie is based on Janes autobiography, and so it focuses less on his scientific achievements and more on how Jane coped with his consuming illness, while raising three children (!). One of their differences was that Hawking was an outspoken atheist while his wife was a practicing Christian. Ironically, given his atheism, the movie suggests it was Janes deeply religious belief that made her care for him despite his increasing disabilities. An atheist or agnostic girlfriend, might have balked at caring for him after learning about his illness. The movie also suggests that Hawkings strange allusions to God in his bestselling book A Brief History of Time was a concession to his long caring wife.
Eventually, their marriage proved too difficult and exhausting, and after many years, they both end up settling with different persons, she with the choirmaster of her local church (played by Charlie Cox), and he with his full time nurse (Maxine Peake).

Eddie Redmayne is wonderful in the starring role. He plays Hawking as arrogant, somewhat mischievous and not always likable, which is understandable given his crippling illness. Also with Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Simon McBurney. Directed by James Marsh.",1423180800,,1975,5.070769230769231
6515959,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Simply amazing!

Eddie Redmayne is an absolute shoe in for Best Actor. He totally transformed into Stephen Hawking. He is 100% believable in the part.

As a fan of Hawking's work for years, I found this story of his life to be utterly compelling. To see how his life shaped his work was fantastic. And his inner humanity really shines through in this film. Unfortunately due to Hawking's condition, his personality is often hard to see. And that's a shame because he's a very interesting person aside from his physics. He's also very funny (Read A Brief History of Time and you'll see his joking personality come through....in a book about physics!). But with his lack of body language and the computer voice, his true self is often obscured. All people see is the science. Eddie Redmayne gave life to Hawking's personality and communicated who the man is to the world.

Keep in mind that Hawking's condition worsened over several decades. And this movie was filmed out of sequence. Redmaybe had to know what year he was filming and match his actions to the real Stephen Hawking from that year, thus giving the complete film showing in sequence the effect of Hawking's gradual decline in health.  That alone had to be mind bending for an actor.

If you aren't familiar with Stephen Hawking this is still a brilliant film. The story by itself is captivating. It's about  how family supports each other. It would be a great story if it was entirely fictional. So you don't have to be a Hawking fan to appreciate it.

If you are a huge Hawking fan you will notice that his ideas about physics are accepted by the scientific community a little more readily in the movie than they were in real life. In the movie Hawking's radical ideas are well accepted from the beginning. His career as a physicist was pretty smooth. In reality his ideas were pretty novel, and met with a lot of criticism at first. If this was a movie focusing on his work, this would be a major problem. But the focus is on him as a person and his family. So those deviations from real life don't ruin anything.

Just don't expect to see intricate science talk. The movie is not about science. It's about people. There are no scenes where you learn anything about black holes, just scenes where Hawking references how he figures them out.

All in all though I found it to be a solid tribute to one of the greatest minds in human history. To the man, not just to his ideas.",1422835200,2,2438,4.5479452054794525
6515960,5,B00LY1YOGA,"In these days of computer-generated imaging and special effects up the wazoo, The Theory of Everything is a breath of fresh air;  a welcomed reminder that greatness on the silver screen still relies first and foremost on an intelligent script, affecting plot and, most important, great acting.  Beautiful cinematography doesn't hurt either.

The Theory of Everything relates the true story of brilliant Cambridge University cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, as he and his family cope with the challenges his devastating degenerative neurological ALS-like disease present over time.  So, on the one hand, it's the bio of a luminary.  On the other, it's the compelling story of ordinary people who are super heroes in retaining grace -- and in Hawking's case an enduring sense of wit and humor - in the face of unimaginable adversity.

Eddie Redmayne, whose resemblance here to the scientist he portrays is uncanny -- puts in a stellar performance as Stephen Hawking. The fresh faced, wide-eyed quality of Felicity Jones, cast as Hawking's wife, Jane, makes her so very endearing; a welcomed departure from the usual line up of plastic Hollywood stars whose uniformity of appearance - perfect teeth and flawless, mannequin features  - so often renders them uninteresting.

No need to hook the audience with scenes of nudity or violence here either.  This PC-13 film does it the old-fashioned way with its substantive plot, great script, compelling actors.  A beautiful film!",1422576000,,1468,5.261802575107296
6515961,4,B00LY1YOGA,"The Theory Of Everything holds your interest largely through the amazing performance of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking, and it draws attention to motor neurone disease in a way that hasn't been done before, and which can only be achieved on film with such impact. The sense of it being an actor's 'stunt' is avoided by the discretion of the portrayal, and by the evident sincerity Redmayne so obviously has. There are problems with the film, arguably, in the way it balances the science against his personal life - for long periods we don't hear much about his work, even though it must have been going on constantly, and the explanations of his thinking could have been a bigger part of the film. In fact some of the most successful parts are possibly the earlier scenes, and there is quite a lot that is enjoyable before he gets ill, and is somewhat gauchely trying to court his future wife while being totally obsessed with his work. These scenes give quite a lot of charm and youthful energy before the calamity of his diagnosis, which are important to see, because there is a lot of sadness after that. Another difficulty arises from the  fact of making such a personal film about living people; I couldn't really see why his marriage ended, and, as shown, it didn't seem to make sense. It also happens rather suddenly, and by this time it does seem to have turned into a bit of a soap-opera. In many ways it is comparable to A Beautiful Mind, about the American mathematician John Nash. There, too, there were problems with making the life fit the shape of the film, although in The Theory Of Everything it is more in the way the life is shown rather than the facts themselves. It is certainly worth seeing to gain an insight into the thinking of one of the great physicists of the age, and for its inspiring story of triumphing against the odds, both through passion for a subject and the right kind of unstinting love.",1422576000,,1929,4.57514450867052

Redmaynes lead performance is far and away the highlight, not only for being so transformative but also for finding deep warmth and humor beneath the mask. Jones is lovely as his faithful wife, and the film uses some nice visual touches to bring certain moments to life, like Super-8 footage and images of deep space.

James Marsh's direction is sensitive and measured. The production design is excellent: the 1960s era is recreated and portrayed superbly. In particular, the costume design for Ms Jones is excellent.

6515964,4,B00LY1YOGA,"This weekend, I had the pleasure of watching two films with extraordinary performances from the leads, making each memorable and insanely watchable. But in each film, decisions were made effectively marring the overall experience, making each 'Very Good' instead of Extraordinary.

""The Theory of Everything"", a new biopic about Stephen Hawking and his wife, Jane, is a remarkably well-made film depicting the life of a man most people know for two things; his life in a wheelchair and his extremely popular bestseller ""A Brief History of Time"". But there is a lot more to this story and this film paints in some of the lesser-known details.

Picking up with Hawking (Eddie Redmayne in a career-making performance) as a student at Cambridge studying physics, we see the student frequently lost in thought, trying to figure out the many mysteries living in his mind. He doesn't seem to have any trouble with his studies, solving 9 of the 10 questions his professor (David Thewlis) deems impossible to answer, he is simply bored and would rather think about the mysteries of the universe rather than spend time with lectures and assignments. He meets Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party and runs into her a few times, but they seem unable to commit to a relationship. They are intrigued by one another because neither is your typical college student; Stephen seems unaware of how he should be courting Jane and she is amused by his confident awkwardness. Stephen begins to notice something is wrong, he can't hold things, he trips, he seems to be losing control of his body. The doctor soon confirms that he has ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and has only a few months to live. Hawking returns to his room at school and shuts himself off from the world. But Jane is determined to get him out of the room. They are soon married. Children follow and Hawking continues his pursuit of a doctorate. Defying every prediction about his disease, his marriage, his life, the thesis becomes the basis of his bestseller and he becomes an internationally known scholar. But there are personal costs.

Directed by James Marsh (best known for the documentaries ""Man on Wire"" and ""Project Nim"") and written by Anthony McCarten, ""Theory"" fills in the details of Hawkings' life, giving us the background and information we don't know about the world's most famous physicist. It is told in an old-fashioned style; the movie begins at an important point in Hawking's life and this leads to a flashback at the beginning of the story - Hawking as a student at Cambridge. Working linearly forward, we watch as Hawking and Jane deal with the ravages of the disease until we get back to that important point that opened the film. This method of storytelling works well here, the story of their life is interesting enough to hold our attention. It isn't necessary to do anything radical; in fact, such a thing could detract from the story and make it less personable. As it is, ""Theory"" helps us become a participant in the story which makes the life of the Hawkings even more emotional and moving.

Eddie Redmayne has been around for years. I first saw him in ""Elizabeth I"", the mini-series featuring Helen Mirren as the Queen. Interesting note: he also appeared in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"", the sequel to ""Elizabeth"", both of which featured Cate Blanchett as the Queen. But his first major role was as Antony Baekeland in ""Savage Grace"". Perhaps because he did such a good job in the role, I found it difficult to watch the performance and had a hard time watching him in anything after that. More recently, he was in ""My Week With Marilyn"" and ""Les Miserables"". Now, with ""The Theory of Everything"", Redmayne proves he is an actor who can create a real and viable performance.

Bringing that ability to really become the character, which made some of his other work uncomfortable to watch, Redmayne really inhabits the body of Hawking. From the moment he appears onscreen, Redmayne seems to both be younger and somehow more frail than he actually is. This is a pretty remarkable feat for any actor, but Redmayne makes it seem effortless, which is one the reasons he is so good. The sparkle in his eye pretty much always there, shows how Hawking really viewed life, even after learning of his illness.

Because of the nature of the character, the actor doesn't have the most lines in the film. But as Hawking's illness continues to incapacitate him, Redmayne continues to bring many aspects of the scientists struggle with his body to life. He really shrinks in on himself, showing the deterioration due to the disease. And it is the rare performance that is all the more memorable because of the lack of words. Because of Hawkings inability to use his voice, Redmayne conveys a lot through his eyes and his limited facial expressions.

It is really an excellent performance that you shouldn't miss.

The movie is based on a book by Hawking's first wife, Jane, played by Felicity Jones. The role is less showy but no less an important part of the story. We see all of Hawking's love, triumphs, set backs, everything through her eyes. Jones does a great job of forcing us to watch her and remember that she is an integral part of this man's life. This is difficult because so much of Hawking is a part of her life and without her, he wouldnt be who he is. Let's face it. Before this movie, I doubt if many knew anything about Jane. When you are married to someone as universally recognized as Hawking, it is difficult to stand out. But that is also part of the story. Jane is always at Hawking's side, providing him with support and encouragement.

As Hawking's body changes and works against him, Jones does a great job of showing how much more difficult this support and encouragement becomes.

David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"") plays Hawking's college mentor Dennis Sciama. The portrayal makes it easy to see what a good mentor is capable of.

The other significant role is played by Charlie Cox (""Stardust"", the upcoming Netflix series Daredevil). Jonathan, a choir director who Jane turns to for escape, becomes a larger part of their family when he is hired to become a sort of live-in caretaker for Stephen. Jane finds herself drawn to him and this helps her to make a decision later in the story.

The significant problem with ""Theory"" is the conventional nature of the narrative. We have seen many biopics that begin with a significant event late in the subjects life. After a few moments designed to catch our interest, they generally move back to the beginning of the story. Later, the big event is revisited as a way to segue into the final moments. It isn't particularly inventive to tell any story in this way, but it does work to a certain degree here. Because the narrative is so 'easy', it allows us to concentrate on the fantastic performances. But easy narrative and stellar acting don't equal a great film, they add up to a very good film.

Director Marsh and writer Anthony McCarten don't exactly do a disservice to the film by taking the easy way out, but it is disappointing.

That said, Marsh does provide visuals which are extremely beautiful and help to draw us into this film, making it more interesting and moving. The scene depicting a wedding that Stephen and Jane attend early in their relationship, which has also accompanied just about every television interview I have seen with one of the two stars, is particularly beautiful and helps to illustrate many things in their relationship. Despite Hawking's overt geekiness, his explanation of the lighting effect helps to make Jane fall for him. It also shows how Hawking's mind works; despite the other elements of his life, science is a constant in his mind.

Because of the tried and true nature of the narrative, I suspect the film will do better with the Academy, and earn more Oscar nominations, than a more challenging film. The Oscars have a history of going for safer films and snubbing better, more interesting works.

6515970,4,B00LY1YOGA,"World-renowned Physicist and Cosmetologist Stephen Hawking is looked at in a drama about Hawkings development of a motor neurological disorder that refines him to a chair. Him and his wife Jane are chronicled from there first meeting at a party to when they eventually marry while starting a family during difficult times. With an amazing performance by Eddie Redmayne who takes on a challenging role, not just mentally but physically, you cant help but be moved by The Theory Of Everything and what it means to be alive.  The film is directed by James Marsh and co-stars Felicity Jones and Harry Lloyd.

Its been a long time coming for me to watch this film as the holiday season was crammed with lots to see. Finally, I was able to watch The Theory Of Everything and how do I describe how much this movie moved me. The life of Stephen Hawking isn't one thats easy to understand as you have to look at his career and his interest in science that propels his understanding of life. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking as young student who develops a form of Lou Gehrigs disease and begins to slowly destroy his muscles that eventually refines him to a wheelchair. His wife, Jane, loves Stephen so much and cares for him that they marry and start a family. But as time goes on and the disease gets worse and worse to the point where Stephen could no longer speak, Jane begins to feel the ramifications it has on her and the family.

What I thoroughly enjoyed about the movie was that you were able to watch the world through Stephens eyes and how he studied lifes little things that matter in the bigger picture. As he broke down physically he was never to lose his confidence nor his will to live. Stephen even went on to obtain his Doctorates degree and would then write a series of books dedicated to the theory of life. As depicted through the film Stephen wasn't someone who was selfish nor had a fragment of hate towards anyone. There came a time when Jane (Felicity Jones) needed the emotional help that was eluding her as then came Brian (Harry Lloyd) who would help take care of the family and also build feelings for Jane.

This brings me to Felicity Joness performance as Hawkings wife who had to emotionally struggle with Hawkings dilemma. Having to live with it wasn't easy for her nor their children but she never left his side. It was interesting to see how Jane and Brian would fall for each other but not in the way most would see it as. Rather, from Hawkings understanding of ones need of certain things in life you came to respect Stephen for not being upset towards Jane. Even though some may argue that she cheated on him even though her husband is specially challenged it doesnt make it okay in the end. And this is brought up because later on Stephen develops a relationship with his coordination coach after losing the ability to speak. They become close that eventually he decides to leave his wife Jane to leave to the United States.

One of the things that caught my attention was how Stephen always managed to crack a smile and never showed a lick of hate. It made me wonder about how we can look to the inside and see what we can do to better ourselves or others that Stephen had done. Theres a moment towards the end where he gives a speech in front of an audience about his new book A Brief History Of Time and life in general. A girl drops her pen while listening to Hawking speak and we then watch Stephen imagining himself getting up to pick the pen up off the floor. He had every intent to want to teach and help those who were eager to learn. Another moment arises when at the very end Stephen is in the garden with Jane as they look at their children all grown up. He says to her Look at what we started as a way of symbolizing what life has to bring even in the most unfortunate circumstances.

James Marsh went about a visually appealing and telling look through the life of Stephen Hawking with metaphorical references to our existence in the galaxy and space. It was difficult to watch at times as Stephens condition worsened and the more he lost control of his movement. There was weight to Eddie Redwaynes character that was more then meets the eye. If your going to watch The Theory Of Everything be prepared to see life in whole new way.",1420243200,2,4282,4.462324393358876
6515971,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I was blown away by this movie.  I noticed other reviewers took umbrage with the accuracy of this story.  I have no idea what the truth is and I don't care.  It's a romantic movie for Christ's sake.  Who cares if it's accurate?  Looks like all the characters were spiffed up for this movie.  No bad guys to be found.  It's a wonderful life!  I'm all for it.  How can you possibly make a popular ""science"" movie without dumbing the story down?  You can't.

The movie is actually about Jane Hawking, based on her memoir.  That is just fine with me.  I find her life story fascinating.  But most of all, I find the movie well paced with a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  A little science, a little romance, a little comedy, a little theology, a little drama, and a great deal of heart.  Probably the best ""science"" movie I have ever seen.",1419984000,3,849,4.245283018867925
6515972,5,B00LY1YOGA,"I will not go into details about this film. I will say many of these fine reviews on here are spot on. The thing that you will notice is the more negative review.

I wish to address those: Those whom have an issue, I can guarantee, are people who assumed it was a film largely about Hawking's contribution to the science world. Yes, this film does not really tap into this information; but guess what? That is not the purpose of this film.

If you read this review, you have had your interest piqued whether you heard of Redmayne's performance, or the cast, or anything at all. I will say that you will not know what the film is like until you try it. However, if you seek a love story, regardless of fictional or existing figures, this is one beautiful tale you will want to watch.

Many continue to say this film is a lie and appallingly inaccurate; well to that I say is: Do you mean to say that Jane and Stephen are liars? Did they simply speak about the script and information and unknowingly said all was accurate when it was a lie? No. This film again is not intended of Hawking's journey in the science field, and out of respect they do dabble that information, but largely the point is the roller coaster of their marriage.

This film truly had me question my perspective of people and their situations. I love this film, and the score and photography certainly were beautiful to take in. I went to the movies and saw this; and when I came out, within seconds I opened up Amazon to pre-order this.

I will certainly not regret my decision.",1419465600,191,1548,4.379790940766551
6515973,2,B00LY1YOGA,"I didn't care for this movie. The characters are unlikable by the end and the makers skirt the science abandoning trust in the audience's mental faculties. Sure, we feel bad for Hawking and are inspired by his spirit to overcome adversity - but that's about it. The rest added up to very little for me. It derails by abandoning Hawking's pursuit of an answer and gives us nothing but a few (convenient, cheesy) glimpses while spiraling into sub-Lifetime-Network-worthy-mediocre-melodrama. Montage after montage of emotional situations doesn't equal a passable film (in that sense).

There's not really a story here. It mistakenly forgets it's central scientist along the way. Hawking is physically in the state we see him nowadays (sans age, naturally) by the films midway point - causing the progression of that particular arc to fall dead. All we're left with is to wonder if his wife is going to give up or not - with the stakes and interest ever decreasing - That's not enough.

The Theory of Everything confirms that just because something happens to a character (true, famous or not) doesn't equate movie material. It does however equate a first draft and then fifteen renditions later you may have something. You can find these rules in the fundamental chapters of screenwriting. This film shouldn't have been green-lit in it's current state. Yes, even at the expense of a pair of terrific performances.",1418947200,26,1410,5.021367521367521
6515974,4,B00LY1YOGA,"Theatrical review.  Certainly a ""for your consideration"" film, a beautifully directed ""Theory"" is the love story between the ALS stricken Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Wilde Hawking (Felicity Jones).  The film avoids much of the theoretical physics and cosmology that made Hawking famous.  Sure, we dabble in his genius but the film wisely avoids digging too deep.

While at Cambridge in 1963, Hawking is stricken with motor neuron disease (his friends tease him with ""motor mouth disease"" which he enjoys), a form of ALS and given 2 years to live.  Earlier he had met Jane and they were just beginning to court.  Surprisingly, they fall in love and get married.  They eventually have 3 children, because as Hawking says ""different system.""  After their second child, Hawking's condition deteriorates and Jane becomes overwhelmed with his care as well as that of the young children.

Jane meets a young choir director, Jonathan Jones (Charlie Cox), and he agrees to provide additional support.  He's good with the kids, and strong enough to handle Stephen's infirmities.  He's also hunky and we see a spark between Jonathan and Jane, but they don't act on their urges.  Stephen eventually decides to free Jane of her marriage vows as her physical and mental deterioration becomes more apparent.

With a film like this, interest levels are sometimes difficult to maintain.  While Hawking's life is extraordinary as is Jane's commitment, they don't lead an exciting life, so the filmmaker's must rely on a taut script and some excellent performance.  They get both, especially from Redmayne and Jones both of which I've always enjoyed watching.  The film isn't perfect as it omits much of the detail of the Hawking's inner thoughts, but the performances are some of the best of the year.  Recommended.",1418688000,13,1811,5.105442176870748
6515975,5,B00LY1YOGA,"At age 21 the legendary Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disease similar to ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and given two years to live. As an audience, it is our privilege to watch a brilliant actor inhabit the persona of a brilliant physicist, cosmologist, professor and best-selling author (A Brief History of Time) who is, over 50 miraculous years later (November, 2014), still alive.

Screenwriter Anthony McCarten, working from the book by Hawking's first wife Jane, gives us a PG-13 script in which there are no bad guys, just semi-ordinary people dealing with extraordinary issues. Director James Marsh doesn't shy away from awkward details but conveys the intellect and wit that defines our hero. Our screening audience laughed out loud many times.

We admire:
  * Eddie Redmayne (""Les Miserables"") is Stephen Hawking, mildly clumsy at the beginning but we are sad to know he will only become worse. Even with a mechanical voice however, he shares his nicely honed sense of humor.
  *  Felicity Jones (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"") is his wife Jane. When she tells her prospective father-in-law that she is a lot tougher than he suspects, we believe her!
  * Emily Watson (""The Book Thief"") Aunt Isobel advises an overworked Jane to join the choir, which sounds absolutely absurd!
  * Charlie Cox (""Boardwalk Empire"") Jonathan is the choir director.
  * David Thewlis (""War Horse"") Professor Sciama becomes one of Hawking's most effective advocates.

In my opinion, the defining moment in the upcoming Oscar race will be when we watch Hawking imagine being whole again. We see Redmayne unfold from his distorted position curled in the wheelchair and in one astonishing take, gradually become straight and tall. He slowly descends the stairs and picks up a pen that has been dropped. No prosthetics; no computer-generated imaging; no camera tricks. Brilliant!",1418515200,89,1890,5.194719471947194
6515976,5,B00LY1YOGA,"With so many mediocre films being released each year, it's refreshing to see a picture that values good storytelling, strong character development, and a meaningful theme over the standard cop-outs of violence, profanity, and little left to the imagination. ""The Theory of Everything"" may lack the typical blockbuster trappings, but it more than makes up for it with its incredibly beautiful and bittersweetly uplifting story, handled with great subtlety and sensitivity by director James Marsh, strong production values, and stellar performances by the principal cast.

Adapted from Jane Hawking's memoirs of her life with her husband Stephen Hawking, the film elegantly and honestly chronicles their triumphs and struggles together following his diagnosis at age 21 of a debilitating motor-neuron disease (ALS), which doctors predicted would kill him in two years. Much in the spirit of ""The King's Speech"", it is a story of the human spirit's ability to triumph against adversity and go up against the odds, no matter how high they are stacked against you, and still emerge victorious. Neither a straight-forward biopic nor strictly a love story, the result is something that gives a somewhat deeper portrait of its subjects than most films based on the lives of real people usually show.

Anthony McCarten's excellent and surprisingly true-to-life script is bolstered by the two very capable leads of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. Neither seem the least bit daunted by the reality of playing real-life figures who, contrary to the norm for biographical films, are still living, and ably match each other in sincere, emotional performances. Their chemistry is strong, which helps to make the relationship between Stephen and Jane more believable, even in moments of absolute silence; a pivotal moment where Hawking has lost the ability to speak and literally can't find the words is made all their more heartbreaking by their combined talents.

Jones is a powerhouse, bringing a strength and determination not typically seen in female roles as Stephen's loving yet conflicted wife. She does credit to her real-life counterpart, a young woman who single-handedly saw to it that nothing would stand in the way of her husband's reaching his full potential, both in his career and his life, yet had her own demons to fight as well. In my humble opinion, her performance puts her as real contender for the Best Actress Oscar next year.

Eddie Redmayne, who happens to be a dead-ringer for the famed physicist, gives a fearless turn as Stephen Hawking. His performance is neither affected nor clownish, and at all times deeply moving. He emulates the effects of the disease so convincingly it's hard to believe it is just an act. As Hawking's ALS progresses, his motor function becomes more and more limited, yet Redmayne never lets you forget the brilliant mind inside. He allows Hawking's indomitable spirit and quirky sense of humor to shine through; merely a sly smile, a twist of the head, a glance, and you'd swear you were looking at the man himself. This complete habitation of a character is the kind that has to be seen to be believed, and coming from someone so young makes it doubly impressive. I know it's a tired clich to say that actors who play disabled characters deserve all the awards, but if anyone has earned a Best Actor Oscar this year, it's him.

I found myself profoundly impressed by ""The Theory of Everything"", something very few films can manage. In an era where we can so easily lose our perspective on life and take so much for granted, it makes you genuinely count your blessings and be grateful for what you have. It also serves as an inspiration to believe that anything is possible, especially in view of the fact that Stephen Hawking continues, fifty-odd years after his diagnosis, to defy all odds. It is an important film not only in an artistic sense, but also for bringing to the public consciousness the inner life of one of our century's greatest minds. If only a handful of people go out of the theatre understanding Stephen Hawking as more than a man in a wheelchair, then I believe it will have accomplished at least some of its purpose.

With that being said, it isn't a film for everyone. For those used to quick cuts and continuous action, the powerfully character-driven storyline and lengthy close-ups with stretches of little to no dialogue may make it seem overlong, but if you appreciate a well-crafted film that gets you to think and feel as only a good film can, then don't hesitate to appreciate it for all it has to offer.",1417996800,11,4616,4.94201030927835

""The Theory of Everything"" is worth seeing for anyone with a basic interest in Stephen Hawking. A pretty nice job of juxtaposing Hawking's scientific breakthroughs with his own (and everyone else's) human relations is its strongest suit. Eddie Redmayne's performance as this difficult-to-portray character is outstanding: He captures the disabled Hawking's perceptions and point of view very well. The film is slow but evenly paced, with a quiet humor throughout. Expertly vivid cinematography too. Yet, the transitions are jerky and abrupt in many places, and we don't really see Jane's reasons for attraction to him, nor how, when, and why things fall apart. Like many other things here, it all happens suddenly and randomly for no apparent reason. This may have been at least partly deliberate, as universal happenstance is another theme here, but still. . . The time-frames toward the end are also a little unclear, and there is little age-progression in most of the major characters.

As others have noted, there is relatively little about Hawking's science in this film, and what there is is pretty basic. ""The Theory of Everything"" is not meant, of course, as a detailed expos of singularity theory; however, just a bit more in this area would help to illustrate some of the more personal themes here. Most of the dialogue is also pretty ordinary: ""The Theory of Everything"" keeps trying to reach for a depth that it never quite achieves. In a number of places, it stops just as things start to get interesting. It seems that the directors of this film were faced with a common dilemma that occurs when all the central characters are still with us and likely to be among the first viewers: They were making a film centered mostly on the Hawkings' personal life but were compelled to avoid getting TOO personal.

Anyway, the theater concession stand attendant told me that she loves everything about this film, as many other people obviously do, so my reasons for being disappointed by certain parts of it are clearly not shared by everyone out there.",1417996800,6,2070,4.959654178674351
6515978,5,B00LY1YOGA,"Stephen Hawking, imprisoned within his own body and confined to his wheelchair, has become this generation's icon of physics. Einsteins unkempt frizz and bushy moustache still hold their place in today's culture. Still, Hawking's image and prosthetic voice are known far beyond the circles in which his works are actually read and studied. So, it's a real pleasure to get a look at the frail and fallible human lives that support his brilliant research.

This movie is said to be based on a book by Jane, his wife of many years. As such, it's hardly a surprise that she comes across as a powerful figure - not a dominant one, but the bedrock that supported Stephen for so many years. I really can not imagine the strength of character it must have taken to watch his medical tragedy unfold, year after year, knowing that only worse lay ahead. I can't know what actually passed between Stephen and Jane, but I can't fault either one for their eventual split.

But, this focus on their personal lives omitted many important episodes of Stephen's life and career - not to mention the science, which earned next to no mention at all. Perhaps that's for the best. So many of Stephen's professional milestones are already well documented. This has a different goal: to study Stephen's human side. Not his robotic voice, not his epochal science, but the things he has in common with anyone else. Without threatening his iconic status, it makes his life more approachable.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible performances of Felicity Jones as Jane, but especially of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen. I know that Hollywood has many ways of making people seem to be what they're not. They can't do what Redmayne did, though, in capturing and presenting the gradual decline of ALS. As much as such awkwardness and tragedy can be beautiful, he did a beautiful job.

6515979,3,B00LY1YOGA,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Theory of Everything""

1. This piece of obvious Oscar-bait is about the life of famous physicist Stephen Hawking. And I feel really conflicted about it.

2. There are some great individual things about this movie - some terrific cinematic sequences and emotional moments. The soundtrack is lush and beautiful.

3. But it's mostly a love story. A fake one.

4.  The movie tries to give the audience a taste of what Hawking did to physics. But it ends up feeling very vague, and if you don't already know his theories, then you just end up with the idea that he was really smart. You don't understand how revolutionary he actually was.

5. It's also a ""greatest moments"" look at the development of his motor-neuron disease, and how he went from a healthy 21-year-old to the famously wheelbound man with a wrecked body and robotic voice.

6. The rest of the movie is a tired, by-the-numbers romance about a woman who stands by her man and together they overcome all odds. A lot of the relationship depicted in the movie never happened in real life, including how it began and ended. Not even close. The film just invents a new relationship for them.

7.  I admit, I couldn't help but spend part of the movie trying to figure out which actors played which characters in the ""Harry Potter"" movies. It was kind of distracting.

8.  Eddie Redmayne (who isn't very well known in America) plays Hawking. It's easily the best acting I've seen in 2014. The way he slowly contorts his body as the disease progresses is one of the best physical performances I've ever seen in my life. It should be illegal for him not to win some acting awards. He almost single-handedly makes the movie worth seeing.

9.  As a showcase for some cinematography and acting, the movie is great.
 As an inspirational love story, this movie is melodramatic and saccharine. You know, the usual.
As a scientific biography, this movie is terrible, and almost insulting.
If you watch this movie, make sure you know what you're getting.",1417910400,68,2030,4.68169014084507
6515980,5,B00LY1YOGA,"This film is a brief history of Stephen W. Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), arguably the smartest man of our time or ever. To the Homer Simpson crowd he is known as ""the wheel chair guy."" The film is not only biographical, but gives hope to people with ALS. In circa 1963 Hawking was given two years to live. Apparently God saw fit to give him more time to prove he doesn't exist. You get 25 minutes of Hawking before he is diagnosed.

It is also a love story and includes a brief history of his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) who struggled and fell.

Hawking is an iconic pop cultural figure too as his book took complex ideas and made them available for the masses. If you watched the film ""God's NOT Dead"" it is Hawking who they parse in an attempt to prove God's existence, i.e. you must prove Hawking wrong first to prove God exists. He is that powerful of a figure.

The film omits quite a bit of his life and work, but hits the highlights in an abbreviated and sometimes low budget fashion. For instance we see him enter the chambers to be awarded and then afterwards. We don't see the act itself. Steven also likes to frequent certain type of California adult entertainment establishments. This is reduced to him looking at a Penthouse magazine. The famous runaway wheel chair accident is omitted.

If I had one criticism of the film it is the ending when they run the film, i.e. time backwards as it shows the producers have no idea what Hawking really said about reversing time. It couldn't be like that due to the laws of entropy. The smashed glass could not put itself back together. Hawking specifically states this in his book.

A movie for science buffs and non-science folk alike.
