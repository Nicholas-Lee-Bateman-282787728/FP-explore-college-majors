3897121,5,B002BWP49C,"I just saw ""Breaking Dawn"" part 1, and I was VERY impressed, even if as a man I am probably not the most typical fan of ""Twilight"" series. I rather liked all the ""Twilight"" movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with limited SPOILERS:

1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading ""Twilight"" books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!

Other actors are also great, with Ashley Greene and Billy Burke being as usual the pillars - but amongst the supporting roles it is Nikki Reed who really gets the most praise from me. She has a much bigger role in this film and she is perfect in it! The one (little) disappointment is Jackson Rathbone, who changed comletely his haircut for this film and as a result his character, Jasper, seems much less impressive, which is a pity. He also seems to appear very little in the ""first line"", almost as if the director preferred to hide him a little...

2. Visual aspects. As usual, the images of state of Washington are great, but the tropical island where Bella and Edward spend their honey moon is also very pleasantly showed. Dark forests filled with (were)wolves are very much present here and they are a great background for the story.

3. Music. As usual in those series, music and songs have been selected very carefully and with a great taste.

4. The (were)wolf pack. The Quileute wolves are shown here even more and better than in the previous part. The scene of their war council, when they are all in the werewolf form, is absolutely great! The scene when Sam (the alpha male) asserts and confirms his power over the pack is excellent - as good as the description of Jacob's defiance and its consequences.

5. The wedding. A very nice and moving scene with some humour elements, especially when the guests make speeches offering toasts. Emmett, Jessica and Bella's father give here a great show. In the same time Mike Newton obsesses on vampire bridesmaids from the Denali clan, to the point of drooling (and I TOTALLY understand him!). Bella's mum and, suprprise surprise, Rosalie (!) are also real treasures in wedding scenes.

6. Quileute wolves vs. Cullen coven confrontation. This heartbreaking, tense and at moments violent conflict in which both sides are trapped against their will is a great moment in the Twilight saga - and its final resolution is even better! Finally it is true what the Beatles were singing - all you need is love! Babies help too...

7. The fight for Bella's life, Renesmee's bloody birth and Bella's fate - excellent! Those were moments very difficult to film - but the challenge was met succesfully! Nothing more about it to avoid more spoilers, but I was very impressed!

Conclusion: it is an excellent movie which I watched with great pleasure. My wife, who usually is a much harder person to please, loved it too and she is going to see it again with some girlfriends. And we will certainly both wait with great expectations for the ""Breaking dawn"" part 2. If it was done as well as that one, it will be certainly worth waiting one year to see it...",1321401600,476,4422,4.622929936305733
3897122,5,B002BWP49C,"My mother started reading Twilight so she could chat with her niece. She wanted the Twilight movie (anything I can do for Mom is going to happen). She was so excited when we finally sat down to watch the movie. It takes forever for the movies to come out in DVD. My father is handicapped, going to a movie is not among our limited to do list options. So we have to wait for the DVD.
oh, I am 49 years old. Last year and this year, I listened to the Twilight music soundtracks and the books on cd, while I created and did the up keep of my corn maze!",1318896000,,549,3.954954954954955
3897123,5,B002BWP49C,I absolutley love both the Twilight books/movies and the Hunger Games books series but for you out there that haven't read any of the Hunger Games books I'll tell you they are 1000% better the Twilight ever thought of being. The first Hunger Games Movie will even be out sometime next year but pleaase read the books first. I've read alot of books in my lifetime and I can without a dought list all 3 Hunger Games books in my top 3 books that I've ever read.,1318636800,3,458,4.275862068965517
3897124,5,B002BWP49C,"When I first heard about the teenage vampire movie ""Twilight, I wasn't at all interested.  Then, one day I stumbled upon it while searching through tv channels.  ZAP!!  To my surprise, I was completely absorbed and didn't want it to end.

I can't say for sure how many times I watched the first three Twlight movies.  I know I saw ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon"" at least ten times each, and ""Eclipse"" was probably five or six.  I found them all wonderfully romantic, exciting and captivating.

I didn't, and still don't, understand how or why I was so intensely drawn into these movies.  I feel very close to the characters, as though they're my own family and friends.  The most puzzling aspect of this fantasy relationship is the fact that I'm fifty-nine years old.  My only source of justification being that Edward is over a hundred.

I also bought all three Twilight Saga CD Soundtracks.  The music may have had something to do with my attraction to the fantasy, as I'm highly driven by music.  Or maybe I enjoy listening to the music because it connects me to the fantasy.

I'm looking forward to experiencing ""The Twilight Sage: Breaking Dawn"".  Based upon it's predecessors, I'm already giving it a five-star rating.

3897125,5,B002BWP49C,"Just saw the trailer for Twilight Breaking Dawn part One and I am blown away already....serious creepy stuff and major ""wedding night"" scene give away!!! I cannot wait for this to open..everyone who is a fan of this wonderful series will nominate Stephenie Meyer for Sainthood....please watch it, the chills are worth it...........",1307318400,17,331,5.264150943396227
3897126,5,B002BWP49C,"YES, I was a late bloomer when I finallydiscovered the Twilight books. I was never one for reading, let alone these sort of books.  I ended up reading all 4 books in two weeks. I have watch the 1st two movies at least 10 times so far.  Its pretty bad that I am starting to know the actors words before they say them in the movies!!  I was also NEVER a big book reader.  I hope that Stephenie Meyer will continue to write more books on these characters from Twilight. (Bella, Edward, Jacob, Alice, Charlie, Renesmea etc...I fell in love with this entire family.  I hope and pray Mrs. Meyer will publish the book called Midnight Sun, Edwards story version. PLEASE!!!!

Stephanie Meyer THANK YOU for being, as far as I am concerned, the VERY BEST Author and story teller around. When I read your books I felt as if I was watching the story unfold before my very eyes.  I cound not put the books down.  I found myself reading till well after 3AM and then still not wanting to stop.  I actually cried  when I was done with the last book.  Especially when it said THE END!  Please don't let this be THE END.

I recommed everyone..of any age, I am in my mid 30's and LOVE THESE BOOKS!!  BUY them, read them, watch the movies I know you will enjoy them!!  Read the books first..it makes the movies even better.  Hope you enjoy a much as I have...",1290729600,40,1338,4.270916334661354

I really enjoyed the books, but, I loved the Movies. Although, I felt that they ended to soon they could have been a little longer. I am really looking forward to the rest of the movies.
I would love to read books written by Alice's life or other characters life's.
The story is not over until the last book is a movie. Thanks for so much enjoyment. Bringing us into a world of pure pleasure to watch/read.",1279065600,29,542,4.294117647058823

3897543,2,B002BWP49C,"After watching Twilight, the movie, a box set of the series was purchased by me.  Yes there are other vampire romance stories out there but why people feel compelled to compare them is beyond the understanding of mine.  I adored both the movie and the book for Twilight.

This two part movie fails to be worthy of the series, believe do I. They both barely resemble the books and the attempt was obvious that they 'tried' to do a literal translation form novel to movie.  They would have been better off ""basing"" the series off the books, such as ""Queen of the Damned"" by Anne Rice, or as they are doing for the Marvel movies... or even the D.C. movies though they are inferior.

First off the Director and/or the screenwriter responsible for the translation failed to read the novel series... or maybe they failed to 'enjoy' what they read and so they forgot half of it.  The special effects themselves were good, but just the way the effects added to the story failed to mesh.  Adding a monologue of 'Bella describing what is going through her head would have made a world of difference.

The movie seemed entirely too dependent on the audience to have read the books, and yet the majority who have done so would find it severely wanting.  For instance, the scene of Bella's transformation, the visuals failed to come remotely close to the amount of pain the books described her being in.  Having Ms. Stewart simply read a short passage from the book as a monologue would have done more.

Grateful for you sharing your time and Force. May you ask the Goddess to eternally alight your self-determined path.",1493856000,,1607,4.623239436619718

3897645,5,B002BWP49C,"This movie caused quite the controversy, and exposed many controversial issues.

The controversy started with Bella and Edward's Wedding.  Both in the movie and outside it, people were outraged over a teenage couple getting married.  People in both worlds assumed pregnancy was the only reason get married at that age.  Marriage was viewed as irresponsibility and failure.  Mothers and Feminists everywhere were furious that all Bella wanted out of life was a Husband and Family.

Next was Bella's pregnancy.  She'd never considered children, never wanted to be a Mom.  Still when she felt that new life within her, it changed everything about her.  The pregnancy was unplanned and highly dangerous.

That was controversial for many reason:

1st)  Many don't accept unplanned pregnancies.  Many activists believe pregnancy must be planned, otherwise it's only biology.

2nd)  Activists everywhere were furiously calling this an anti-abortion agenda.  Bella had that option, but wouldn't do it.  All the pro-choice groups couldn't accept Bella's choice.

3rd)  When Bella argued about her choice, she said ""My body, my choice""  She reversed the meaning of the familiar slogan.  Then Edward's helplessness over that demonstrated much.  He was forced to watch as his wife died, because her body meant he had no choice.  That's the same agony men everywhere feel when their unborn child dies, because her body means he has no choice.

4th) The pregnancy starves and breaks Bella.  She knows she can't survive it, and still can't end it.  There was a time when people understood that creating life means risking life - not anymore.

The final controversy was over Jacob imprinting on the Newborn Baby.  So many people were disgusted and outraged over that.  I have 2 things to say to them:

1st)  Taken literally imprinting doesn't translate to human terms.  It's a supernatural occurrence.

2nd)  Taken figuratively it's inspiring.  Jacob had blamed Renesme for what Bella had gone through, and he'd hated the baby for that.  Then in a moment of clarity Jacob saw Bella's daughter in new eyes.  Saw why Bella had fought so hard for her, and knew he had to do the same.  With that epiphany, Jacob became Renesme's protector.",1487980800,,2219,5.094972067039106
