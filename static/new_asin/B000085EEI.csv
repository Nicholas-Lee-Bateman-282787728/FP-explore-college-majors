1827386,1,B000085EEI,"BEWARE! This is NOT the ""Whole Bean""!!! Whole chunks of these episodes have been edited out (possibly to make them compatible with some sort of commercial format). Furthermore, there is no disclaimer to that effect anywhere on the packaging which is clearly unethical if not illegal.

1827391,5,B000085EEI,"What a great collection. If you like Bean,this is a must. In great shape and always plenty of laughs.  Three disks mean laughs for a long time. Has to be one of the best comedians ever. A real natural. Hollywood should take note, as a lot of their comedy aren't funny.",1479686400,,268,4.254901960784314
1827392,5,B000085EEI,"This is the set with the complete original 1/2 hour skits, which probably what us fans want. Great to have on hand when kids visit. The appeal is universal for children. I had an old tape version when I lived in the poor hinterlands of 2 South American countries (I'm a geologist). The poorest kids who couldn't understand English just howled with laughter. Especially the Swimming Pool and making a sandwich on the park bench.",1475280000,,427,4.706666666666667

1827399,5,B000085EEI,"Decades later, he's still hilarious. Rowan Atkinson, as Mr. Bean, showed that one actor can be funnier with almost no words than an entire modern movie is with too many words. The humor is largely clean and appropriate. While there is sound, most of the humor comes through even if the TV is muted. Atkinson masterfully pantomimes his way through the funniest scenes. The ""less is more"" approach reminds me of reading a single-pane comic, like Far Side, filled with humor on several levels.
Although the original records are quite old now, they hold up quite well. The humor is still there and the older setting only adds to the experience.",1463011200,,640,4.774774774774775

1827403,4,B000085EEI,"Some very funny steches by Rowan Atkinson, involving goofy visual/slapstick humor. Mostly all-ages safe, other than a couple naked backsides (generally those of Mr. Bean trapped outside of his hotel room, etc). Some skits are hilarious and some can be tiring, it's hit or mess, but all told the collection is a good one. But what's the deal with that blue car?",1455148800,,360,4.82258064516129

1827409,4,B000085EEI,"I got this as a gift several years ago, and was excited to watch all the episodes I remembered watching on PBS years earlier. This DVD set has lots of fun extras, including an episode and some additional skits never before seen on American TV. However, there are a few episodes MISSING some scenes.
The ones I noticed were the Christmas episode, where it doesn't show him winning the giant turkey by guessing its weight, then throwing it into the boot of his car; and in the episode where he buys the recliner to put on his car, it doesn't show the scenes inside the store, where he messes with the chair so no one else will buy it.
It makes one wonder if scenes are missing from other episodes as well.",1448755200,,703,4.333333333333333
1827410,2,B000085EEI,"I was SO disappointed in this. It's NOT the ""whole"" Mr. Bean. Partial is more like it. I got it for my dad for Christmas and was so ticked that parts were cut out. Why cut it out? There's no point to it. People shouldn't buy this one if they really do want the WHOLE Bean. We always watch Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean on Christmas and then the New Years one for New Years and there were parts taken out. FUNNY parts too! Whoever put this together out to be horse whipped! Not cool at all.",1448582400,,485,4.0625

1827420,5,B000085EEI,There are 3 DVDs here packed full of videos.  Initially I'd watch these when I went to bed but falling asleep became out of the question for me.  I just had to watch every second.  Each story is unique and just the right length.  I'm still smiling.  I'd recommend this set to anyone who enjoys humor.  Mr Bean is always solving problems in his own unique and funny way.  He makes you want to cheer him on.  Great stuff.,1436659200,,419,4.215189873417722

1827422,5,B000085EEI,"I still remember with pleasure and I watch this show! Rowan Atkinson is a prime example comic artist. But here double the pleasure. Because Atkinson to some extent in his show paid tribute to art Chaplin and at the same time, he developed his own inimitable style. For several seasons, his character Mr. Bean said a few words. But his facial expressions are rich in emotion, it is told us about many things. Mr. Bean is an eternal teenager. It seems that even in old age, he will behave like a child. He loves to play pranks, to commit petty crimes, but he has a kind and sympathetic heart. Mr Bean is a classic of humor and satire!",1435795200,,632,4.364406779661017

1827463,5,B000085EEI,I remember these shows were on HBO back in the 90s.  It was silly but I enjoy silliness along with the great expressions without too much dialogue.  This proves the comedic prowess of this guy...I highly recommend.,1402876800,,214,4.756756756756757

1827469,5,B000085EEI,"Mr. Bean is so funny. Usually, I find ""British humor"" to be an oxymoron, but Bean is a great exception. Anyone can relate to the silly situations he gets himself into, and how he solves them in convoluted, ridiculous ways. Bean is one of a kind, and his show is family friendly. I dare you not to laugh at this innocently clueless clown.",1398470400,,337,4.365079365079365
1827470,5,B000085EEI,If you like British humor you will like these episodes. The funniest part is that Mr. Bean does not talk. He does not have to say anything to be so very funny. These episodes are great for watching when I need to laugh. Also I have shared with visitors and everyone loves Mr. Bean.,1393804800,,281,4.222222222222222
1827471,5,B000085EEI,"The character of Mr Bean is childlike without being pathetic.  In all the skits, the actions convey the story  brilliantly and hilariously and it is almost an intrusion when words are spoken.  My favorite skit is Mr. Bean meeting the queen, The whole thing is played out without one word being spoken but not a word was needed to convey the anticipation and the angst he feels as he awaits his moment with Her Highness.  Genius!",1393027200,,428,4.592105263157895

1827473,5,B000085EEI,My husband is a Mr. Bean fan and we were disappointed when it was no longer shown on our local PBS station.  My kids know Mr. Bean from the movies and the animated versions.  I bought this as a Christmas gift and the whole family enjoys watching it together.  It is hilarious watching 'tweens giggle at the bare-bottom scene in the swimming pool!  I also love that there is very little dialogue and most of the humor comes from physical comedy.,1390953600,,444,4.444444444444445

1827475,5,B000085EEI,"This is a fun video set.  And is the Bean we all know and love.  Our favorite episode has always been Mr. Bean's Christmas show in which he plays with the Nativity set in the department store.  As an FYI, hubby got curious as to what the opening and closing choir numbers on each episode (which are in Latin) were actually saying.  It turns out the the Latin words ""Ecce homo qui est faba."" and ""Vale homo qui est faba"" are translated as ""Behold the man who is a bean."" and ""Farewell the man who is a bean"" :)",1387843200,,509,4.111111111111111

1827482,5,B000085EEI,"It's Mr. Bean, what more can be said? Other than Monty Python, what British comedy is funnier? O.K. yes and Tracy Ullman. But believe me Mr. Bean rakes up there, yes I love BENNY HILL. He is and always will be a legend, But while Mr. Hill is hands down funny, there is something about Rowan Atkinson's humor that is more accessible to me and while I have seen everything MR. Bean has done, this DVD really is the BEST. I do recommend though you get the complete Bean and The Best Of Bean Vol. 1 & 2 because like Monty Python or Tracy you have to know everything they've done to truly appreciate them/him.",1373241600,,604,4.260869565217392

The real star of the series is Teddy, however, played by the riveting actor Teddy. Daniel Day-Lewis and Robert De Niro have nothing on him. If ever I saw true method acting, it was from Teddy.

Throughout the series, Teddy was subjected to brutal tortures and humiliations such as being hypnotized, shrunk in the wash, used as a paintbrush or mop, and being forced to sleep in a shoebox under the bed.

Mr. Bean is a masterfully acted, impeccably filmed, brutal and unflinching look at Teddy, and the hardships he suffered at the hands of a madman.",1349568000,,1287,6.465116279069767

1827504,5,B000085EEI,"Not too long ago I found ""Mr. Bean, Vol. 1"" on our DVD shelves. I enjoyed it and reviewed it as five stars. Now I've found that we didn't just have Volume 1, we had a set of volumes 1, 2 and 3 on three separate DVDs. Evidently, my wife must have purchased them put them there where they got lost in our cluttered collection. Well, I'd never heard of Mr. Bean, The Whole Bean or Rowan Atkinson who plays him, but she's lived in London for three years and Mr. Bean was a popular program on the telly, so it figures that she might have put the set there. Finally, I got around  to watching them.

It's difficult to explain Mr. Bean to the uninitiated. The DVDs are a series of skits presented as British TV episodes, each lasting a little less than a half hour. Altogether, there are 14 episodes and each episode has three or four parts. The skits have very few spoken words, but are accompanied by a laugh track. The material represents British humor, through and through. Watch these and you'll be laughing. Trust me.

Mr. Bean is Rowan Atkinson who is a comedian and something of a mime. The skits are acted out, sometimes with Mr. Bean only and sometimes with other participants. Almost all of the humor is very physical and a lot of it is really corny. To what might it compare? Well, I'd say it was something like some silent movies, except there's sound but very little speaking. Some of the skits are something like Red Skelton's mime acts. But, make no mistake, he's uniquely his own act.

Mr. Bean performs such acts as getting into swimming trunks before removing his pants in a public area and then removing his pants with the trunks on. This is something you just have to see. Words don't do it justice. Or there's the ""Packing a Suitcase"" skit. There's a host of other acts and most of them are things we all do or have done, but he makes them outrageous. One of my favorite skits had to do with do-it-yourself remodeling. Just wait until you see how he paints a room. I was sick with laughter!

Plus there's a lot of skits involving his car (an Austin Mini, I'd guess) and his driving skills. The individual skits are highly varied and you'll not be watching an on-going story. Some are just off the wall acts. He's funny. Maybe not all of the skits are funny because it depends on your own experiences and sense of humor, but about the time you find your attention span drifting, you're laughing again. It's very enjoyable comedy. Watch these discs when you're feeling sad and/or gloomy. It's a good antidote.

Bean is a man child that gets into and out of trouble in the classic Lucy style.

Now for a warning!  My wife never got into Mr Bean and as my teenage children and I watched this everyone Saturday on HBO she would comment, ""what do you see in that as it is so stupid!""  Yes!  Stupid is good!  Stupid is funny!  Not stupid for stupid sake but it comes out stupid like Steve Martin's ""The Jerk"" stupid.  Very original writing and adlibbing.

Flash forward a few weeks and as I was flipping through the channels, I saw Mr Bean was on. I stopped for a minute to see ""that dumb show"". A few minutes into the episode, I found myself smiling and even beginning to snicker a little. I had begun to enjoy Mr Bean.

I caught a few more episodes and ended up buying this box set. It is great! You may have to give it an episode or two, but you will be pleasantly surprised!

The slapstick humor still gets me, but after watching the interviews and behind-the-scenes, I've grown to appreciate Atkinson much more.  The characteristics he attributes to Mr Bean are clever and imaginative, and there hasn't been a single episode I didn't laugh it.

I didn't give it five stars because, personally, it didn't make me burst out laughing at the seams.  I only reserve five stars for ""gagariffic"" shows, and I feel I couldn't for this one.  But I indeed chuckled enthusiastically at the whims and farces, and can tell people they must watch Mr Bean.  Being a silent character limited by his childish maturity (oxymoronic, I now, but it still applies), he can appeal to a wide range of audiences.

1827537,5,B000085EEI,"To those who are about to die, of laughter, I salute you!  I first encountered Mr. Bean on BBC television in the early 90's while stationed overseas with the military.  Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) is probably one of this last century's greatest comedians.  American audiences have been exposed to him through PBS and through the introduction of two movies in theater's and on DVD.  I purchased this box set when it was first released, joyously, and have been intending for years to write a review for my fellow Amazon shoppers.

If you enjoy revisiting Mel Brooks movies and absurd comedy, over and over again, if you enjoy the best sight gags, physical comedy, and intelligent humor delivered via the medium of a buffoon, then you cannot go wrong with this set.  You will watch it uninterrupted, one episode after another straight through and will not go 60 seconds at a time without howling out loud.  Mr. Bean does not speak much and when he does, it is mostly unintelligible mumbles.  His comedy is universal, relying on the visual but also relying on you to think of all the resulting implications, hence one wonders at the true nature of just what exactly IS Mister Bean?  Mr. Bean points out not only how much we take for granted in human behavior and morality, but he points out the absurdities in our day to day life.  We rush through our routines without a second thought as to WHY we do certain things and behave in certain ways, unquestioning even the smallest details, but Mr. Bean accomplishes the very same occurrences with baby steps, step by step instructions, painfully accomplishing the most minuscule details without regard to and oblivious to the effects upon those around him, or to the resulting pain to himself.  Mr Bean is unquestionably devoid of any common sense or ideas of right and wrong, he is in a sense, a child without adult guidance; sometimes something akin to a blank slate.  He is as nonsensical and silly as Benny Hill (though without Benny's crude and crass humor) or as many Mel Brooks characters.  He brings Buggs Bunny and Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin to life in modern times.

""Mr. Bean""s title sequence from the second episode on, depicts Mr. Bean either falling from the sky in a beam of light, or more than likely being thrown to earth literally. The meaning of this has been argued as  Mr. Bean being an alien or representing the return of an abductee who's brain is now addled, or to his being an angel either sent to Earth (not fully baked) or literally being thrown out of heaven (too bad to occupy the heavenly spheres but too good to be damned to hell).  The producers of the show claim that it is intended to show his status as an ordinary man cast into the spotlight.  However you take the meaning, Mr. Bean is anything other than ordinary!

Rowan Atkinson is both the creator and the deliverer and the personage of Mr. Bean.  He created him while still in college, brought him to life in a British comedy series, and has brought him to the big screen, all without a misstep.  Atkinson can act in other comedy styles, but his creation, Bean, is the embodiment of mindless or thoughtful (whatever your comedic disposition) pure talented howling funny comedy.  I dare you to watch this entire set and not be satisfied it was money well spent.  I have watched this entire set at least twice a year since it came out.  It makes me laugh at the same jokes in the same places each and every time, even after I know them by heart!  Atkinson is a genius.  How many people start laughing at a joke they know is coming before it's even begun in a movie they know well, but already anticipate the punch!
Mr. Bean changes from his street clothes and underwear into his bathing shorts at a public beach, all without ever getting naked.  In a public park, Mr. Bean makes a fresh sandwich from raw unassembled and unwashed ingredients with a pair of scissors, a credit card, a drinking fountain, and a sock.  Mr. Bean's new television only works when he holds the antenna in a part of the room where he cannot see the screen.  How does Bean finally get to watch it without moving the tv itself?  Mr. Bean's car is a Mini.  He is late for a dentist appointment having overslept, so he dresses, washes, and brushes his teeth while driving.  You'll see.  Mr. Bean can't fall asleep, so he counts sheep using a calculator.  It's funnier than it sounds!  They don't sound all that funny, but Rowan's magic is to make the ordinary bizarre, make the commonplace hysterical, and make the out-of-the-ordinary outrageously comical.

Mr. Bean is obviously smart enough to take a trigonometry examination but when opens up his envelope he finds a calculus exam and panics.  He attempts to cheat off his neighbor until, with only a few minutes to go, he discovers that there is a second sheet in the envelope, the trig exam!  The lead-in to this fiasco, his preparation to take the exam, the careful extraction of each and every spare pen in his suit, just to annoy the student next to him, would be dumb humor as delivered by a Jim Carey character, but Bean's facial expressions, his hand and arm and eye movements are all carefully calculated to extract every screaming laugh from your cellular inner DNA, you cannot escape Rowan's art, try as you might.  And if you have never experienced Mr. Bean, you are really missing a treat.

If you are not familiar with Bean the series, go to YouTube and try some of the short bits collected there, you'll be back here in no time, plunking your money down.  [p.s. if you have read reviews pointing out ""missing"" parts of Mr. Bean episodes in this ""complete"" DVD set, please be forewarned, it depends upon your point of view:  if you never saw a Bean episode it won't matter much to you, if you watched the series on BBC or anywhere other than the USA, you won't be missing a thing, but if you have memorized each and every episode from American Television exposure then you are likely to notice something.  Rowan Atkinson was forced to re-insert cutting room floor material into the USA airings in order to fill them out for our time blocks we are used to in the States.  If you do any research at all on the internet, you will find that Atkinson was rather displeased with having to do so since he considered the material he reinserted for the American audience, which is included in the older VHS versions of this set, he considered the material to be fecal matter, `nuff said.]

Because Mr. Bean is a silent film character in an audible modern world, the comedy crosses language and culture barriers and can be enjoyed by literally anyone anywhere.  This is probably one of the most successful ""international"" series ever!  I only recently discovered that Rowan based his character on a French character named Mr. Hulot created by Jacques Tati in the 1950's and that those French films can be enjoyed by us ignorant Americans without the need of subtitles!  I plan on visiting those creations for the first time soon.  No matter though, the endorsement here, from me is, anyone with a sense of humor, any sense of humor at all, will not be able to stifle the laughter, the tears of laughter, which will be brought about by watching this incredible character.  All hail, Mr. Bean!",1216771200,,7256,4.609338521400778
1827538,4,B000085EEI,"We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old. They love to watch Mr. Bean episodes. His silliness ellicts giggles from our kids like I've never heard while they watch Saturday morning cartoons. When Mr. Bean gets a turkey stuck on his head my kids roll on the floor laughing.

I know several episodes in this collection are edited and several fans have already noted that in their reviews. As much as I wish the edits hadn't been made this set is still a great buy if you are looking for family-friendly comedy to share your young children.

My sons loved this DVD set so much we also purchased Mr. Bean, The Animated Series, which I also recommend (see my Amazon reviews) here:

1827541,4,B000085EEI,"Doing physical comedy like this is very difficult to accomplish successfully.  Luckily, Rowan Atkinson has the talent to do it beautifully, and get away with it.  This show is well conceived and delightfully executed by Rowan, who has said that he approaches the character of Mr. Bean as ""a grown man with the mind of a 9-year-old boy: not necessarily evil, but a bit simple and self-absorbed.""  There's very little dialogue in any of the 14 or so episodes of this very funny Britcom....and there doesn't need to be.  Atkinson carries the show exquisitely with mostly physical comedy, where even simple daily tasks like packing a suitcase or making a sandwich is hilarious, even without a word.  Mr. Bean has so much to teach, like how to get dressed in a car while driving, or how to paint an apartment with the aid of explosives, or how to avoid waiting in line for a doctor at the hospital, or even how to drive while sitting in an easy chair that's strapped to the top of the car.  There is a lot of brilliant physical comedy here with universal appeal.  This can be played anywhere in the world without translating or subtitles.....you could even turn the sound off on your TV and you will still be laughing hysterically from beginning to end.  This show is just that good!",1212537600,,1278,4.599118942731278

A few of the scenes might not be approproate for young children (comic nudity) but I highly recommend this set.  If you are a fan of the Bean movies, you will love these original episodes and you will see where some of the ideas in the movies had their start.  Atkinson has created one of the most original comic characters to date.  His physical comedy is the best I have seen.  It can be as outlandish as Jim Carey but also very subtle.  Bean is sometimes mean, sometimes selfish, and always hilarious.  His appeal is to all ages.  If you want to share laughs with the family, watch Bean!",1206403200,,708,4.4186046511627906

On a practical note, ""The Heart Attack"" skit in ""Mr. Bean Rides Again"" was incredibly effective in our company's safety meeting to communicate the potential outcomes of ignorance in a cardiac emergency. It awakened interest in proper CPR techniques.

Then I watched some of the episodes on PBS here in the USA and was surprised to see some additional scenes that were not part of the original one that I saw before.  Later I realized that the company that made Mr. Bean series were forced to add some scenes because when it was broadcast in the USA there were no ads. and the TV station needed an episode of approx. 27 minutes or so.  When the original series was run in the UK there were ads every 10 minutes or so.  That is the reason that people who have watched it on PBS or other reruns here in the USA feel that it has been edited, when in actuality what they were watching on TV was the edited version (to fill the time constraints).

Mr Bean was great making a fool of himself falling asleep in church or cutting up his sandwiches with scissors in front of another guy in the park and generally just acting retarded.

They've brought the DVD set to family gatherings -- all the cousins crowd around to watch it, and the room is filled with laughter.

Mr. Bean is somewhat of a simpleton, and the kids enjoy his childish sense of wonder and naughty pranks. He doesn't speak much, so the youngest children aren't bored with dialogue. The naked scenes of Mr. Bean are hysterical, and the kids are incredulous at his antics. When they're not wathcing it, they talk and joke about Mr. Bean.

Those scenes that you are all used to seeing, such as the chair scene and the turkey weighing scene, are just extended scenes that were added onto the syndicated versions. Unfortunately, A&E ended up using the original broadcast version rather than the extended version for the DVD. So, they weren't exactly edited, they just didn't included the extended footages.

I don't know how much funnier it is with the ""missing"" parts but for me it's perfect like it is. The quality is great too...I wouldn't buy VHS just for the missing bits and get a lower quality video.

The funniest episode was the television.  That has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen!  Mr. Bean rents this television, but he can't get the picture to work.  He has a rather unique way of trying to fool the set into keeping the picture straight.  Once he masters the art of tricking the set, his allotted time runs out.

I've laughed hundred times over, even though I've seen the episodes over and over again.  I bought this collection because I needed it most--with my health failing, there's nothing like laughter to make one feel better.

Who can NOT laugh at Mr. Bean's antics?  Him making the sandwich in the episode ""The Park""? Or my all time favorite: him driving around after the new year sales in the episode Christmas Shopping--who would be crazy enough to drive ontop of the car???

OR another favorite, him dressing in the car--crazy with a capital C.

But, funny, till you puke!  The Dentist episode was quite classic....who would want to ""do-it yourself"" denistry?

Even with the fellows who have seen the ""uncut"" versions of it, this is still a classic stomach-full of laughter.  There are too many scenes in which I can describe as insanely funny--you'll just have to buy it yourself to see!

As I understand it, when the series was shown on PBS, the episodes were too short to fill the required half hour, since in the UK, it was shown WITH commercials (hence the shorter length of the episodes). PBS apparently asked them to ADD scenes to fill the time. These ""fillers"" were seen as ""throw away"" scenes by the producers, and not what Mr. Atkinson originally envisioned for the series. Therefore, when the dvd came out, the ""filler scenes"" were cut. Only those who originally saw it on PBS will notice the difference.

Mr. Bean is a masterpiece of visual comedy, carrying on the tradition of the greatest actors of the past - Laurel and Hardy, etc. Some episodes have the power to make you laugh out loud over and over again - and you will want to watch them over and over! Mr. Bean is much gentler than Blackadder (never fear) and can be enjoyed by all ages.",1141084800,,626,4.548672566371682
1827623,3,B000085EEI,"I thought that many of these were pretty funny and entertaining. The only problem is, there is a good number of the Episode that has got risque and crude humor moments in them. There were plenty of them that you would want to keep your children away from watching, if you wanted them to have clean minds. There were plenty of crude things to count. Like, for example, on a couple of episodes, there is a couple of scenes that showed men sitting on toilets, even though one of them was because Mr. Bean got his hand accidentally stuck in a man's pocket, and has to follow him the whole way, and another was because Mr. Bean accidentally put on the wrong pants, and determined to get them back, and doing so, found that a man sitting on a toilet in a booth was wearing them, so he had to sneakingly pull his pants off of his legs, causing partial nudity exposure from above, and how he had to throw his underwear back to him, which just so happened to land in the toilet that he was sitting on. Those were somewhat indecent. Also, there were some risque humor involved, too, such as, on the ""Back to School, Mr. Bean"" episode, Mr. Bean touches an electric device that causes him to get a paper stuck to his hand, which he tries to handle to a woman in there, and just as he does so, her dress flies up over her head, and stays there. Also, on that same episode, there is a part where Bean goes into an art room, where they are drawing pictures of various objects. And one of them happened to be a naked woman. Mr. Bean attempted to fix that problem, though, by making clay pots on a clay string, to cover her breasts. A young boy comes in with his mother (who gets chemicals blown all over him, by blame of Mr. Bean), and as the mother takes his covered over glasses off, he looks around, and suddenly spots the naked lady. He gets aroused by looking at it, and his mother drags him back out. It is just after that when Mr. Bean gets the clay pots ready to cover the lady's breasts, so that he could be able to finish painting comfortably. So, those parts are kind of crude and risque. Also, there are two or three episodes that involve Mr. Bean accidentally being naked, where at the worst, you can only see his backside, though. The first time we see him naked is in ""The Curse of Mr. Bean"", where he accidentally loses his swimming suit, just after falling off the diving board, and a little girl finds it, and gets it and takes off with it, before he is able to get to it, when attempting to. So, he has to hide in the pool, until the guards leave, and he has to try to sneak out of there, by the time the coast is clear. He doesn't manage to get spotted being naked by a bunch of women who run away and scream; and during that moment, you can see his naked bottom. Also, you see him naked on the episode ""Mr. Bean in Room 401"", when he accidentally gets locked out of his room one night, even naked somehow, and he has to try to manage to sneak around everyone, without being spotted looking that way. You can see enough of him to be risque, even though he does cover his private parts with certain objects. Also, there is one where Bean can't get his TV to work, so he has to strip down, in order to get it to come on. That one was really stupid, and made no sense at all. But, it was kind of risque, when with his crafty skills, he set his chair in the right position, and then he had to stip completely in order to do it. We do see him strip all the way down to his underwear (which happen to be high-cuts, instead of boxers), which does tend to go too far. But, at least that when he takes his underwear off, he gets in a box first. Also, not to forget, there is an indecent exposure part also on ""Tee off, Mr. Bean"", where he thinks he needs to take off his underwear in a laundromat, so he takes off his pants in a mostly hidden corner, but in a way that we can still see him enough, and he even turns out doing it in front of a woman, who sees him. He does end up accidentally putting on her dress right then, though, which fooled him, because they were exactly the same colour as his pants that he was wearing. You never again after that point ever see him try to manage to get back on his pants somehow, though. Anyway, I just told you all of the risque parts that I can remember. Due to all of those pieces, I would suggest that all of you parents don't let your kids see these. Especially any of the episodes that have any of that kind of stuff on them. There is one where Mr. Bean puts on a speedo, and it does look immodest, but is not risque, because he has to put it on in front of a man on the beach (without realizing that he was blind anyway), and by doing so, he puts them on over his pants, then tries to manage somehow to get his pants off out from under them. That is the cleanest one that still has an immodest act in it. I know that a lot of it was made for laughs, but when they were being made, they could have cut all of the crude, immodest, and indecent parts in it. There is also crude plays, such as, on one of them, where he is standing in the royal isle with a bunch of formally suited and dressed people, getting ready to greet the queen, he accidentally gets his zipper locked somehow, and he gets his finger stuck in there, and accidentally makes a gesture with his finger of his penis sticking out of his pants. That went way too far, and looked very embarrassing. I'm sure that it may of made Bean feel self-conscious to do so, but it was not really necessary to have in there. It was about the most crudest part in them all, I would say. Like I'm saying, all of these parts could have been left out. They were too indecent, even for children to see, and families to want to see together. They could have been totally clean, even enough to be appropriate to show children of all ages, and had different clean ways to replace all of the crude stuff that Mr. Bean was involved in.",1140566400,,5918,4.124675324675325

1827625,5,B000085EEI,"These are NOT edited..let me explain. The only fans who will notice bits missing are USA fans because the MR BEANS when shown in the USA were done on a tv station without commercials, opposed to in the UK where they were shown with ad breaks. Because of this the USA tv station requested extra material to be put in to pad them out to the required length. The production company obliged, put in little bits n bobs to stretch them and so when this release came out, comprising of the official versions..shown everywhere else in the world they thought they were edited. Essentially although slightly different to the USA broadcast versions, these ARE the way Rowan Atkinson intended them to be viewed, the oddments which were added to the USA episodes as a necessity were considered surplus to requiremenrs, inferior in many cases and left on the cutting room floor. OK, so perhaps these scenes could have been included as extras..outtakes for example..or even the extended episodes used for this release BUT I don't think its any major crime, Rowan Atkinson decided these were what he wanted broadcast in the UK/Europe etc and thats good enough for me. Basically only USA fans will notice any change, and even then just slight changes...all in all this is a great set, cheap and VERY funny.",1135641600,,1289,4.758928571428571

1827633,4,B000085EEI,"Rowan Atkinson playes a hilarious man named Mr. Bean. His rediculous and stupid humor make it really funny and entertaining to watch his different episodes which make up this three dvd set.

The show first aired on PBS before it started coming out on video and DVD. Everyone in my family loves Mr. Bean, once again because of his quite hilarious and dumb humor that he lets out on tv and dvd.

The story of Mr. Bean is basically him living his life on his own with hardly any friends except for an extremely ugly girlfriend which he hardly cares about. Not caring about anyone or anything. (Cutting in line in hospital, bumping into everyones car with his.) Although he seems very lively at times, he also has a softer side to him, for example, sleeping with a teddy bear at night which make adds a tiny bit more emotion into this set of Mr. Bean dvd's, although he hardly shows it.

Unfotunetely, some of the scenes are cut out which make it a little bit more confusing to watch, for example in ""Do it yourself Mr. Bean"" or ""Merry Christmas Mr. Bean."" That is the only reason why i knocked off one star of this review. The only problem with Mr. Bean i find, is that he tends to be a little too stupid at times, as he tends to repeat his actions. (For example when hes in the testing room, and he cant stop pulling pens out of his pocket.) Although it sounds very funny, it can be a little bit tidious when your trying to watch it, you just feel like saying ""cut to the chase!""

Obviousely, there is hardly no action whatsoever, or any suspense. But that doesn't mean that it isn't good or funny, in fact i think it would be worse if there was action, and i am definetely an action fan, but if your talking about Mr. Bean, action doesn't fit his style at all.

There is hardly any script in Mr. Bean which makes it even more entertaining to watch, considering that 99% of the parts that are funny are results of his actions, and not what hes saying. (I'm laughing right now as i'm righting this review because im remembering some of his greatest hits for example when hes on the diving board and he refuses to jump of, or when hes getting dressed and brushes his teeth all in the car while hes driving, those were probobly some of the funniest episodes ever in the whole of the Mr. Bean trilogy.)

In conclusion, Mr. Bean won't attract everyone to his humor seeing that he tends to be a little bit to stupid and tidious, or hes sometimes very rude, (for example cutting in line at the hospital wing, or spitting toothpaste and people) but hey! he can be nice, for example saving someone from a heart attack or when he sees the saxaphone player on the street and he doesn't have any change, so he gets money by dancing to the music. But for once he cares about someone else, and gives the money to him considering that he needs it more then Mr. Bean. One question i do have though, is what does he do for a career? He must do something seeing that he afforded to by the apartment room and accessories? Oh well, Mr. Bean is over with, i guess we'll never know...",1112400000,,3060,4.303819444444445

1827636,4,B000085EEI,"This DVD set is pretty neat with Mr. Bean's hysterical skits but I do agree though that some scenes were left out in this DVD set like in that episode where Mr. Bean goes shopping, they edited out the part where he's at the market. So maybe they shouldn't call this DVD the WHOLE Bean but they should just call it The Mr. Bean Set. They should release out another set again and add the edited scenes onto the new Bean set. Then they can call it the WHOLE Bean. I hope they do that. I hope they release another Bean set with the edited scenes. I mean come on! Edited stuff you can see on TV. Whenever TV shows come onto DVD, it should have edited scenes that were not shown on TV so maybe it's still better to watch Mr. Bean on TV instead of getting this set. Because the episodes of Mr. Bean showed on TV had those scenes they edited out on the DVD set. But this is still a good set with Mr. Bean's fantastic skits but I just don't like that it they edited out some of the scenes.

Superbly played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean takes us into the doldrums of day to day life to show us that even the smallest gesture can be the funniest.  He whirlwinds us through England in the most unconventional way, either in his sporty yellow car (with lock), or in his dentist office, or his doctor's office, or around the countryside stopping at several childish playgrounds.  No matter where he takes you, the laughs are sure to follow and remain with you for a very long time.

Atkinson has mastered the ability to bring this verbally challenged character to life in ways that comedians today falter.  Atkinson weaves this richly developed character into simple settings where he transforms into part social satirist and part MacGyver of the common man.  His ability to take any common item and transform it into a new bit of comedy is rare today.  The fact that you never knew what Mr. Bean was going to grab next on the set always allowed endless moments of joy.  Now, I can watch him over and over again thanks to A&E and the power of DVD.  Released as a set, I can see Mr. Bean morning, evening, and late afternoon whenever I have the urge to laugh at life.

This series is enjoyable for the newest Bean follower to even those of us that have been following him around for years.  While some novice viewers may be disappointed to see the cuts that A&E made to some of the episodes, the packaging and supplemental features should suffice.  It is packed full of fun information about Bean, especially a very informative feature on how Bean was created by Atkinson himself.  It also allows us to see some of Comic Relief UK that showcased the talent of Mr. Bean right next to Alan Cummings himself.  The extras are just more icing on an already sugar-packed cake.

Overall, this collection is amazing.  I love Mr. Bean and the style of humor that he brings to each episode and situation.  He is funny without being crass or vulgar, allowing us to build so many new dimensions on this simple character.  Atkinson is a master in his trade and has created a character that will be remembered for years to come.  So, if you are a fan of slapstick humor with intellectual stimulation, than Mr. Bean is right up your alley.  The set is not expensive, so I say go ahead and splurge on a DVD that you will never regret purchasing.  You are definitely in for a hysterical treat!

Mr. Bean is a role model for all and the true face of comedy!

The sound and picture quality is first rate and the packaging is wonderful except for one error on the info which exchanges 2 episodes on the actual discs.

 The ONLY disappointment is the ""Turkey Contest and weigh-in"" and another scene in the furniture department where he out wits a potential female customer on a lounge chair by rigging the wiring to fold her up in it... a very funny scene, unfortunately missing here. Never mind, there is so much more to this set and with the extras and good price, you will have many hours of fun on this one.

As for the humor, unlike what a previous reviewer has stated, the Mr. Bean character is not entirely silent, he talks more often than is stated but in short sentences and in a strained voice not unlike the character he voiced during a ""end-of-the-world cult"" sketch in ""The Secret Policeman's Other Ball""--if  you want a comparison, the style of humor owes much to Chaplin or Keaton, but in a modern setting...

Mr Bean is seen as a god here in Japan. He is an alien. At the beginning of each episode you see him drop from a UFO. My favourite part in the whole series is where Mr Bean's bathing costume comes off at the public swimming pool. You can see his can. It is very funny. I also like where he blows his noes on this jacket in church. I also like his car. It is very English and very comical as also is Mr Bean. Mr Bean reminds me of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Every time I see Tony Blair now I laugh.

However, this series is a great choice FOR adolescents.  I personally use it as a conversation-starter for my ""English as a Second Language"" kids' classes, and for that, it is incomparably good.  The lack of dialogue means that there's no intereference in foreign kids' understanding...and no sounds to get in the way as the kids explain the action onscreen.

1827650,4,B000085EEI,"I have always been a fan of Rowan Atkinson since I first saw 'Black Adder' and 'Not the Nine O'clock News'. I must admit that I was at first a bit slow to warm to Mr. Bean as I think Atkinson is more brilliant when he is playing an evil conniving character (which is why 'Black Adder' is such a huge favorite of mine), but the comic charm of Mr. Bean finally won me over.
Atkinson is brilliant as the slightly slow, but always inventive Bean. In the best episodes his ability to do physical comedy is far and away greater than any other living actor (excelled only by the late Peter Sellers.) There are evidently a few missing episodes here, but they were apparently left off so that the producers could fit the documentary 'The Story of Mr. Bean' onto the set and keep the size at three discs. I am personally delighted with the documentary, but agree that the set shouldn't imply completeness with the title ""The Whole Bean"". As it is I am still very satisfied with the set, I only wish that if it is the definitive boxed set, that it was all inclusive, hence my four star rating.
If you are new to Mr. Bean, you will be amazed at the range of Atkinson's performance. My two personal favorites are both in episode one in the form of 'The Exam', a wonderful physical performance piece of a student desperately trying to cheat on an important exam, and my all time favorite Mr. Bean, 'The Church', in which Mr. Bean makes quite a spectacle of himself in church. His 'singing' in particular had me rolling on the floor.
I think that anyone that likes the series should have the DVD set, as it is a true treasure. Perhaps in the future A&E can produce an additional DVD to truly get the whole Bean into our hands!",1073779200,,1711,4.35

Poor Bean stumbles and bumbles his way through scenarios an average person would take for granted.  You'll laugh as Bean tries to go to sleep, is late for the dentist, fears the diving board and, my favorite, tries not to fall asleep in church.  Every episode is filled with fun for the entire family(with the exception of the swimming pool episode, where Bean's backside is bared).  This is physical comedy at its finest.  Don't let the motion picture ""Bean"" deter you.  The television series is by far a better show.
Atkinson should be considered one of our time's greatest comic actors.  He is also fine in the Black Adder series and the Thin Blue Line.  Buy this DVD if you want to see a real comedian in top form.",1072742400,,838,4.533333333333333

1827655,5,B000085EEI,"When I first knew about ""The Complete Bean"", I was waiting for the new DVD to come.  As I read the reviews I was complete disappointed and promised myself to wait until a really whole version of the videos was published.  After a couple of months, I read again all the reviews and among the new ones I found, for my surprise, that I 'd never seen the scenes other reviewers claimed to be deleted.  I went to the VHS I recorded in 1994-1995 from air TV in my country (Uruguay), and those scenes weren't there at this time.  As an example, in ""Do it yourself..."", as Bean enters the store, it appears the title ""end of part one"", and at the return of commercials, the title ""part two"" appears as he's going out of the store.  There is no ""armchair buy scene"".  Same for the ""turkey weigh"".  As here we speak Spanish, the titles (in English) weren't from local TV, so I must think that the ""deleted scenes"" were cut-off originally in England.  As I said, that was in 1994-1995, so there's no doubt that A&E has nothing to do with it, and the version that says that Rowan wants the videos to be seen that way is completely true.
Said so, I think if I can buy the DVDs with all I've seen on TV plus extra scenes, the collection deserves a 5.

""We have received numerous emails from viewers like you who believe that our recent release of Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean is missing footage. We discussed these concerns with Rowan Atkinson's team. According to the executive producer of the show, the masters that we received were the official complete versions approved by Rowan Atkinson. The ""missing"" scenes referred to by fans were extra footage shown on television outside of the United States. We have released this complete series as Rowan Atkinson himself intended it to be viewed.""
This still leaves some questions unanswered, such as: since the series is not in fact American at all, how is footage shown ""outside of the United States"" 'extra,' and not, rather, the original version? However, since they state that the A&E tranfers were approved by Rowan Atkinson, one can only speculate that they can indeed be considered legit; perhaps these are effectively a new cut from the producers of the show. At any rate, my own concerns were largely quashed after reading this, so hopefully this will put things to rest for others as well.",1064016000,,1285,4.819004524886878
1827658,5,B000085EEI,"I'm serious about that title.  Her lack of humor is legendary in her house.  My wife remembers sitting and watching Warner Brother's Roadrunner cartoons with her father and brother, rolling around on the floor laughing their heads off while her mom would stand there ironing and shaking her head.  ""Stupid"" was all she would say.  I had a mission.
I had seen Mr Bean on a local PBS channel and loved the four or five episodes they broadcast regularly.  The lunch in the park had always been my favorite.  It always reminded me of Chaplin without the heavy soundtrack.  The math test always brought forth a smile and Bean's visit to the dentist is the stuff legends are made of, so I ordered the complete set.
Christmas.  Oh my Lord, sweet Christmas.  I had never seen Rowan Atkinson's Bean Christmas shopping and the way he occupies himself while waiting for a cashier to ring him through.  This scene is worth whatever Amazon is asking for the set.  My wife and I watched this while our sons were taking a nap and nearly had to turn it off because we were afraid of waking them up.  The sheep!!  The T-Rex!!  Oh my GOD!  The T-Rex!!  Then my mother in law arrived with diapers and bagels. (She shops at one of those wholesale clubs and is always showing up with bizarre combinations like that.)
We immediatley hit the back button and played the scene for her.  Her face brightened when Bean bounced the ornament, she smiled when he began the play at the manger and when the T-Rex appeared...  ""That's just stupid"".

1827660,4,B000085EEI,"Though ""Blackadder"" is, in my opinion, his best series, ""Mr. Bean"" is ultimately what put Rowan Atkinson on the map. The story of a bumbling, almost mute loner getting through life might not sound overly exciting, but it is made hilarious by outrageous situations and Rowan Atkinson's priceless delivery.
Newly released, this 3 DVD set has all of the episodes, and some decent extras. Anyone who purchased the VHS tapes when they were made available (circa 1995) would know that the episode ""Hair by Mr. Bean of London"" was not televised. It is included here. As well, all the episodes that we know and love are here to enjoy. My favorite episodes are ""Mr. Bean in Room 426"" (where he stays at a resort hotel), ""Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"" (where is drives his car while sitting in an armchair on the roof), and ""Back to School Mr. Bean""  (where he gets the wrong pair of trousers and steals them back). All of the episodes are funny in their own way, but some definitely stand out. Similar to most comedy shows, the jokes will dull with repeat viewing. Most of these episodes I have seen many times, so I don't laugh quite as hard as I used to. But I could watch Rowan Atkinson in anything, and I think he rivals any comedian around. I enjoy him more when he plays more speaking parts, because he's very well spoken and funny on a more intellectual level, but Mr. Bean is for the more slapstick comedy fan.
The DVD package has some nice extras. The big attraction is a 40 minute documentary called ""The Story of Bean"", which is actually the story of Rowan Atkinson. It has interviews with Atkinson himself, his past collaborators (writer Ben Elton, actors Angus Deayton and Helen Atkinson-Wood), and it also includes information tidbits on how he started out in comedy, how he develops his characters, and so on. It is very entertaining. They have also included two sketches from UK comedy relief, where Mr. Bean goes on a dating show (hilarious!) and where he caused trouble at an ice skating show (also very funny). There are also two Mr. Bean sketches that have never seen the light of day, and they are both very funny.
Happy as I was with what was included, I couldn't help but be disappointed by what they didn't include in this set. There is no commentary, which would have been good since there is no dialogue in the episodes and the commentary (especially from Atkinson) would be fun. Also, they didn't include any of Atkinson's wonderful standup comedy bits. I would have loved it if they could have included ""Rowan Atkinson Live"" in this package, to give Mr. Bean fans a chance to see some of his better work. But you can't always have your cake and eat it too, so I am content overall with this DVD package.",1062633600,,2717,4.579055441478439

There was a little birdie on my shoulder that told me I should read the Amazon reviews before making the purchase. However, I thought maybe A&E had learned their lesson after the Monty Python debacle, where they used the cut and censored BBC tapes from the '60s and '70s for the Flying Circus DVD set (to much outrage from loyal fans). It appears they have not.
So I'm now a disgruntled owner of the chopped-up Mr. Bean, and am kicking myself squarely in the face for it. I own the box sets of Are You Being Served, Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances and The Young Ones, all from BBC Video. The packaging on each is superb. The video transfers are breathtaking, the episodes are faithful to their original broadcasts, and there are enough special features to choke a mollusk. Outtakes, interviews, episodes of related shows and commentary... it's all there with the BBC, and gives new depth to each beloved show. A&E uses that extra disc space to advertise their other products (though to be fair, the extras on the Bean box set were leaps and bounds over what they've done in the past).
When all is said and done, I'm left to ponder if A&E is lacking in the quality assurance department, or if they just don't care. Bean may not have been a BBC show, but A&E should look to any BBC Video release to see how to handle all future BritCom projects they plan to undertake. It actually pains me to give this box set four stars - Mr. Bean is a shoo-in for a five-star review if ever there was one - but sadly, A&E's hackjob demands it.",1055376000,,1649,4.409836065573771

The turkey segment is included in Disc 2 episode Merry Christmas Mr. Bean & the beach segment is included on Disc 1 episode Mr. Bean.  It's not cool to rate things that you haven't even seen.  It's bad for A & E to edit 2 or 3 minutes from each tv episode now on DVD, but that doesn't mean that everyone has to give it just 1 star for the 3 DVD set.  Each episode runs between 23 & 25 minutes & there's 14 episodes so there's plenty of good laughs.  If you're somewhat of a Mr. Bean fan, you'll love it.",1054339200,,553,3.9909090909090907
1827672,1,B000085EEI,I've just received an e-mail from the producers of Mr Bean (Tiger Aspect)and it states that their will be a PAL version of the FULL TV series to be released on DVD/VHS in Autumn.,1054166400,,178,4.264705882352941
1827673,4,B000085EEI,"I enjoyed reliving the episodes of the Mr. Bean series on this DVD, the transfer was good. However, I was left with the feeling that something was amiss when watching certain episodes. Like the other reviewers said, there are certain scenes edited from the episodes. What a shame, otherwise it would have been a great complete DVD.",1053907200,,331,4.824561403508772
1827674,5,B000085EEI,"I would disagree with whoever wrote the review giving only one star.  Mr Bean was NEVER produced, released or screened by the BBC - but by ITV.  ITV shows commercials and so to allow space for these each episode shown is 25 minutes!
I was born an raised in Britain and watched Mr Bean first hand every time they were released.  There is NO missing footage and I feel that people should check their facts before bad-mouthing establishments like A&E.
This collection is great - including the documentary and Is well worth the money!",1053734400,,530,4.617021276595745
1827675,3,B000085EEI,"When I heard that all the classic Mr. Bean episodes were going to be released on DVD finally, I was excited. However, after receiving it, I noticed, as did many others here who have submitted reviews, that certain key scenes were missing from some of the episodes. Two glaring omissions on disc 2 include the ""Turkey Weigh-In"" scene from ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean"", and, the ""Chair Sabotage"" scene from ""Do It Yourself, Mr. Bean"". Discs 1 and 3 appear to have no missing scenes that I have noticed. Fortunately I still have my VHS ""Box of Bean"" collection, which I will keep, in order to preserve the episodes in their original entirety. The bonus features are wonderful, and am glad to see their inclusion. However, I was a bit dismayed by the omission of the live Boston performances of the classic ""In The Church"" sketch. I support the other reviewer's sentiments in the hope that a COMPLETE Whole Bean will become available some time in the future. I also hope the live Boston performance will become available on DVD as well. I would have otherwise rated this a 5-star collection, had everything been intact",1052611200,,1113,4.742268041237113
1827676,4,B000085EEI,"Unfortunately, the producers of this DVD set decided to refry (edit) classic television in order to save a few pennies - to keep this set down to three DVDs, rather than four.  Yet, they included a promo for the animated series?  Shameless.  For this reason, I can give the set no more than four stars.
Curiously, I must also mention that the labeling on the DVDs is incorrect.  The last episode listed on the back of the case for Disc 1 is actually the first episode on Disc 2.  Also, what the case says should be Disc 2's first episode is actually Disc 1's last.  Shoddy production work - but not necessarily worth a rating reduction.
But, that said, Mr. Bean is still wonderfully funny, and I have found the DVDs to be wildly entertaining.  My six year old daughter is now a big fan, and I was amazed at how much my three year old enjoyed Rowan Atkinson's physical comedy.  Mr. Bean is good, clean ""G"" rated fun that the whole family can enjoy.  This set is a far better alternative to the single disc ""highlights"" DVD that had been available before.
Having watched the entire set, I do feel satisfied with my purchase.  However, I would have been very willing to pay more for a fourth DVD in the set, so that ALL of Mr. Bean's priceless routines could be enjoyed in their original state.",1052438400,,1291,4.409282700421941
1827677,1,B000085EEI,"I was never so appalled by a DVD product as I am with The Whole Bean! Obviously these were the episodes which were shown on commercial television (A&E) which needed to be cut in order to accomodate the commercials. This would not have been an issue had the BBC produced this series on their own. Luckily I was forwarned by reviews here and then received the proof when my friend purchased them. I am a big fan of Mr. Bean, but I will not compromise my standards just to satisfy a need. Companies need to realize that producing a sub standard product will not be tolerated. If Mr. Bean sells well (which it probably will) then this only enboldens such companies to release further truncated versions of films and television series. Wait for Mr. Bean to come on your local PBS station instead of catering to a company that does not care about the consumer.",1052179200,,854,4.516129032258065
1827678,3,B000085EEI,"I am so disappointed to find that chunks are missing from each episode.  Everything else about the set is perfect - the picture is so clear, the extras are very good... I just can't understand why they would cut pieces out to make it all fit into 3 DVDs.  I don't know a single Bean fan who wouldn't have sprung for the extra [money] to add one more DVD to the set and make it truly complete.  Or at least give us the choice of ordering ""truly complete"" or ""missing some parts"".  This is the same as choosing between a regular network-cut DVD movie and the Special Edition director's cut.  SIGH. I suppose they plan to make more money when they come out with the ""Truly Complete Complete"" edition.  PLEASE, NO MORE ""BEST BITS"". Just give us the real thing.",1052179200,,756,4.364285714285714
1827679,5,B000085EEI,Mr. Bean RULES!!!! ROWAN is the best.. Two thumbs WAY WAY WAY UP. If you do not have this GET IT! You will laugh ... !,1051920000,,118,3.576923076923077
1827680,4,B000085EEI,"To my surprise -- and in spite of my somewhat jaded and cynical nature -- I laughed out loud at every one of the 14 episodes of MR. BEAN: The Whole Bean. And I laughed at the two previously unseen sketches.  In this day and age, what's a guaranteed laugh-out-loud worth?
There's a touch of Jacques Tati's cheerful but hapless Mr. Hulot in Rowan Atkinson's Bean character. In some ways, Bean is a distant English cousin to Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman.  There's the weird, borderline-puberty, but arrested-development in an adult male body thing going on.  To say nothing of an oblivious self-centeredness and a devlish brattiness. But more than anything, I suppose Bean's secret is that he's an adult Brit in touch with his 9 year old inner twit.
Finally, the entire scrummy Bean oeuvre is available in one 3 disc set. Some of my favorites: Bean takes an exam and gets weirdly competitive as he tries to cheat, a modest Bean goes to the beach and tries to change into his bathing suit while not first fully removing his pants, Bean gets up late for a dental appointment and dresses while speeding in his micro mini car,  Bean goes to an adult education center and gets his car crushed by an army tank, Bean enters his Teddy bear in a village pet show and then there's, uh oh, Hair by Mr. Bean of London. Bean really blossoms when his haughty disdain for authority surfaces.
Also included are two never-before seen sketches (Bus Stop and Library) and an OK 40 minute documentary about Bean the character and Atkinson the actor.
Atkinson's Bean is in the tradition of the classic silent clowns and these marvelously silly short films, where few words are spoken, have a universality that is almost guaranteed to connect with that cosmic funny bone at the center of our being.  Low brow?  You bet -- but highly recommended.
""Oh Teddy!""
Indeed.",1051833600,,1840,4.681114551083591
1827681,5,B000085EEI,"Mr. Bean The Whole Bean DVD set is a great complete DVD collection of all 14 Mr. Bean episodes.  When I first heard that there were only 14 episodes, I thought 'That's not very many...' But you have to keep in mind that for EACH episode, there are 3-4 skits.  So do not fear, there is PLENTY to watch in this DVD set.
There are 3 discs, with episodes on each one and the last disc has episodes and special features.  There are 2 additional skits, and 2 Comic relief specials that are hysterical.
Perhaps the best feature is the 40 minute 'The Story of Bean' Documentary.  Rowan Atkinson talks as himself about being Mr. Bean, and there is A LOT of footage of him performing prior to being 'Bean'.  This gives many people who may only know him as Mr. Bean a great look at how funny of an actor he is when he's talking too.  It also gives a look at who Mr. Bean progressed through some of his other skits, and a look at the planning of each episode with the writers.
This DVD set was worth every penny and is an outstanding collection of every 'Bean' skit.  Highly reccomended!",1051747200,,1075,4.266009852216749
1827682,3,B000085EEI,"This DVD set which proclaims itself to be the ""whole"" Bean isn't quite what it appears to be.  While it does contain, in essence, all 14 episodes of the classic series, many of the episodes are slightly or even significantly EDITED.  Two glaring examples are: in ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean,"" the scene of Mr. Bean winning the turkey by guessing it's weight, then throwing it in the back of his car has been CUT.  It is NOT here.  In ""Do-it-Yourself, Mr. Bean,"" the entire 4-5 minute scene of Bean inside Harrod's trying to take the sale chair away from the old people who get there first has also been CUT.  He goes inside... and comes back out with the chair.  There is NO scene inside.  I would hardly call this the WHOLE Bean.  Many other minor segments of him driving have also been cut.  All in all, each episode now runs 24-25 minutes instead of the general 27 to 30 minutes.  It's a real shame that this set couldn't have been done right, even if it took a fourth disc to do it.  I will miss those little moments that are now apparently lost forever.  However, what we are left with, edited or not, is still a nice collection... thus, I have to at least give it 3 stars despite my disappointment at it not being truly COMPLETE.  I really doubt we will ever see a special ""uncut"" release, so go ahead and add this set to your collection.  The picture's better than ever and the special features are nice but a wee bit minimal.  Enough complaining, it's still the best show around... even with his bits and pieces removed.",1051660800,,1527,4.4035714285714285
1827683,5,B000085EEI,I had seen the live 'Mr. Bean on Blind Date' while stationed in England.  This was done before a live audience and Mr. Bean is Bachelor #3 on the English series 'Blind Date' (The British version of The Dating Game).  The segment is only about 7 minutes long but is absolutely hysterical!!!  I am glad that the rest of the world can finally see this segment.  This was especially made for the charity 'Comic Relief'.,1050710400,,415,4.493333333333333
1827684,4,B000085EEI,"I have just recived this box set. I am blown away with the collection. The picture is perfect better than I can recall. The 40 min. documantry is good but not great. The episode's are in order except for a misprint on the case it self on the first disc says that the ""Trouble With Mr. Bean""  is on that disc .The episode ""Mr. Bean Rides Again"" is on the first disc not the second so the order for these two are switched. I am now able to share this funny man with me family and not having to catch now and then on cable. However I am a little dissapointed that their is no Commentary.

1827685,4,B000085EEI,"I'm sure this DVD set is incredible, and it most definitely will beat the only current existing Mr. Bean related DVDs, which include ""The Best of Mr. Bean,"" a funny, if not cheap ""best of"" reel where Mr. Bean simply reminisces about classic bits, and the Bean: The Movie DVD, a movie which I liked very much, but was sort of a rehashed film, and the DVD was sparse. The VHS including deleted scenes is better. Anyway, this DVD set is great for including the documentary and the other bits and pieces, but nonetheless must lose major points for not including a Rowan Atkinson commentary on the episodes! Grr! What a mistake! I'll still buy it, though, and you can't beat Bean when it comes to laughs.",1048723200,,699,4.511811023622047
1827686,5,B000085EEI,"I remember it was a September of 1994 at my home in Greece. I turned on the TV and tune to the first channel I saw. A guy was coming out of his house and he was wiping his feet on the mat. It seem to be stupid, but not so stupid as what followed. It was one of the most hilarious TV moments I experienced in my life. I remember myself from this moment on trying to record on the VCR all the episodes, but this DVD collection is much much better. This a definitely must have. If you liked the movie you are going to love this... Mr. Bean is one of the best characters ever created on TV. The total of 13 episodes will give you infinite laugh and sympathy for Mr. Bean.",1048377600,,667,3.911764705882353
1827687,5,B000085EEI,"Reviewing the Movie: Before he appeared in a lot of hollywood-esque movies, Rowan Atkinson (RA) was put on the map with a little program named ""Mr. Bean""; back in time, when he lived in London.
Following the steps of Benny Hill, RA made a comedy program with almost no dialog (inspired by the Pink Panther, or Chales Chaplin maybe?), such program was very short (only 14 episodes), but it was a big hit in his country and then, elsewhere.
Finally A&E made the wise decision of release all those great episodes together in DVD (after releasing a lot of ""Best of"" DVD's), with some extras (but i think that the main feature of this collection are the episodes themselves).
Most of the episodes are ""All Family"" stuff (except maybe a couple of episodes where Mr. Bean appears naked, with some raunchy humor, but not so far from a PG rating).
If you liked ""Benny Hill"", certainly you will love the Bean guy.
Reviewing the DVD: Contrary to the ""dvdfile.com"" review, the video transfer of the programs are very good, the blacks are black and the whites are whites... the video is FullFrame format, the audio is very good; in the extras, you find a featurette, a trailer, and some sketches never released in TV(that i hadn't see yet); the foreign language support is null (no subtitles, just english audio tracks), fortunatelly the programs almost don't have dialog, so, i don't consider this a problem.
