8292505,5,B001DAVUBO,"I bought four beginner DVDs, and I found myself coming back to this one.  Lorelei does the move then breaks it down by L. and R. and does repetitions.  She is filmed in front of mirrors, so you can see the tricks from different angles.  She is engaging and clear with her instructions.  If you're looking for a good beginner DVD, I'd start with this.  They all pretty much cover the same moves but I think she explains them best.
P.S.  Current availability shows one for $119.  Not worth THAT much, review applies only for reasonable pricing. ;)",1319673600,,545,4.5
