330739,4,6301358570,"Every macho filmmaker has to make his own ""Bunch of Guys on a Dangerous Mission""
movie, to quote Quentin Tarantino (""Inglourious Basterds."") In 1957, tough little
cigar-chomping, shoot pistol instead of saying ""Action!"" writer-producer-director
Samuel Fuller made ""China Gate,"" about a nationality-mixed squad of French Foreign
Legionnaires and a curvy Eurasian doll with tumbling hair under a Chairman Mao cap,
who travel up a Vietnamese river by sampan and then march through the perilous wilds
to blow up a cave packed with Russian-made bombs and shells, and confront a death-
dealing Red Army Major who says, ""We'll bomb anything-- that's why we'll win.""
Call it ""Apocalypse on a Fake Far-East Movie Set.""

  The leader of the band is Brock, played by an uncharacteristically rugged Gene
Barry. The curvy Eurasian doll is Lea, or Lucky Legs (Angie Dickinson), and we are
treated to the sight of her long delectable ones stretched all the way across the
Cinemascope picture by way of introduction.  She married Brock, but the racist heel
deserted her and their baby son because the boy had, Brock said, ""Chi-neese eyes.""
Lea, a double agent, has agreed to lead the squad to the Red ammo dump in the
northward ""China Gate"" in return for taking her son to America.

  Along the dangerous journey, we get some insight into the mercenaries of this
motley gang.  There is Goldie (Nat ""King"" Cole), a vet of WW II and Korean War
who likes to sing as he cleans his ""grease-gun.""  There's a tough Greek, two
Frenchmen, a Vietnamese, a P.T.S.D. Hungarian who is haunted by a Russian soldier
he killed in Budapest, a German of the Hermann Goering Division who proves NOT
to be a rat, and Lea's cousin Leung, who gets the thankless ""coolie"" job.
Generally they detest Brock as much as Lea does.

  1950's movie fans will enjoy Lee Van Cleef as Major Cham, a formerly sensitive
schoolteacher who has grown to love blasting villages.  He shows off the ammo cave
to sexy Lea and gloats, ""This is my kind of Garden, my kind of Revelation!""  He
falls hard for that sexy Eurasian Mata Hara.  She shrugs, ""I'm a little of
everything and alot of nothing.""  Other good lines are given to the German, who
avers, ""I always get hurt where it doesn't show,"" and the Greek, who gasps, ""I don't
like for people to watch me die.""  Brock replies, ""We don't like it either.""
The most prescient line of all goes to Cpl. Pigalle.  When told that the Americans
are his friends, he retorts, ""I don't see them fighting over here in their own
uniforms!""

  I really appreciate Sam Fuller because he tells you at the movie's beginning
WHERE you are and WHEN.  Here we see the stoic-faced little boy running through
the rubble of ""the last free village in the North.  The year is 1954, the day
Thursday.  All animals have been eaten.  All...but one.""  The boy is hiding a
frightened puppy under his shirt, and a ragged, silent, hungry-eyed Philip Ahn
advances toward them, pulling out a blade that shines in the sun like a flame.
The kid runs for the safety of a French machine-gun post behind sandbags.  The
message is clear:  you can trust the French even if you can't trust your own
neighbor.  Fuller regular Paul Dubov is reassuring as Capt. Caumont.

  Victor Young and Harold Adamson wrote a wonderful theme song for ""China Gate,""
which reflects the majesty and tragedy of Vietnam's history.  Nat ""King"" Cole
sings:
  ""China Gate, China Gate, many dreams and many hearts you separate.
  Like two arms open wide, some you welcome in, and some must stay outside.
  Bowl of rice, bitter tea, is this all the good earth has to offer me?
  Will I find peace of mind?  Does my true love wait behind the China Gate?""

  The DVD from Olive Films has excellent b/w picture and sound, although with some
noticeable video speckles.  There are no extras.  The sound did not kick in until
I started the movie from the ""Scenes"" option. For the price, I would expect better.",1367884800,,3931,4.696480938416422
330740,3,6301358570,I had waited for this movie to come to DVD and was pleased to see it not only would be on DVD but appear in blu-ray. The movie is one of my favorite B films from the fifties. It is not just a good film but shows the roots of the Vietnam war as having been essential in spite of the liberal war haters of that era. My big regret was to find it was poorly reproduced as it skipped several times throught the first two/thirds of the movie.,1367712000,4,436,3.9101123595505616
330741,3,6301358570,"Olive Films and Paramount Pictures have released this DVD of this Twentieth Century Fox film in its
original 2.35 Cinemascope ratio,the picture quality being very good. This leaves us with a very interesting
question.
If Olive/Paramount can do this, why can't Fox do it themselves with their Archive releases, where many of
their Cinemascope pictures are released in pan and scan?
Perhaps Fox could transfer all future releases (and reissue their pan and scan failures) to
Olive/Paramount for us movie buffs everywhere.
Incidentally I am not too enamoured with the movie itself. To see the cast chasing around the jungle,
mainly in the dark, I find rather boring.",1366675200,,663,5.148148148148148
330742,4,6301358570,"Gritty Sam Fuller war film finally restored...kind of.  It's great to have this back in print again. As Fuller notes in his autobiography, ""There were enough hot topics in this adventure love story to push everybody's buttons. Communism and colonialism. Racism and tolerance. Black markets and capitalism. Abandonment and fidelity."" Great cast led by a nasty Gene Barry,a very young Angie Dickinson,Nat Cole,Marcel Dalio,Lee Van Cleef. The new BluRay has deep blacks and decent contrast through most of the film, but there are episodes of white digital ""snow"" marring the image through parts of the middle of the film.

330744,4,6301358570,"This is a great film that has been lost to the masses for too long. Now, the only time the movie is shown is late at night. And, it is the chopped up, badly edited version.

It is amazing that so many films are not available on DVD. It took forever for the John Ford movies ""Wagon Master"" and ""Sgt. Rutledge"" to make it into DVD. Hopefull ""China Gate"" will soon join the ranks of lost films found again.

And on a musical note, one of the great singers of all times Nat King Cole not only has a supporting role, but also sings the theme song.",1291334400,8,542,4.05607476635514
330745,4,6301358570,"I'm giving this VHS version 4 stars instead of the 5 it really deserves because the current cropped VHS version does a grave injustice to Samuel Fuller's visual style and his creative use of cinemascope. When the film was available on 16mm I used to run it in my Samuel Fuller class to show students the type of innovative work several films exhibited in the 1950s. As it stands at the moment, the VHS cropped, pan and scan version represents a travesty of an outstanding film.

 As the other reviewer has noted, CHINA GATE is one of the first American films to deal with the Indo-China conflict that formed the prequel to the Vietnam War. But the casting of Angie Dickinson and Lee Van Cleef as Eurasians is not as bizarre as several reviewers noted. Lucky Legs (Dickinson) has been abandoned by Brock (Gene Barry) due to his racist reaction against his newborn son who looks Oriental. The film thus takes a more incisive look at American racism than does THE GREEN BERETS a decade later. By contrast, Lee Van Cleef's Viet-Minh commissar is a more humane end educated man than his American counterpart. He wishes to adopt Brock's son and Lucky Legs and provide the home Brock refuses to give them. However, Lucky Legs wishes her son to be an American despite her personal experience of racism from a man from ""the land of the free."" Like RUN OF THE ARROW, CHINA GATE deals with the complex issue of American identity and pulls no punches. Nat King Cole's Goldie has lost his wife to cancer, lives only for killing ""commies"", and condemns his white American counterpart for deserting his wife and child. It is one of the best performances Cole ever delivered in any American film.

 But, as well as exhibiting Samuel Fuller's baroque visual style indebted to yellow journalism and the comic strip (which Jean Luc-Godard appropriated in the Vietnam sequence of PIERROT LE FOU a decade later), the film opens with documentary footage before it moves on to its fictional component. As early as 1957, Fuller has already begun to blur the boundaries between documentary ""reality"" and ""fictional"" narrative to raise issues usually related to the alternative realm of experimental cinema, boundaries that were not generally questioned in contemporary Hollywood narrative.

 Far from being a perversely bizarre film disdained by most mainstream reviewers, past and present, CHINA GATE is actually a more challenging work dealing seriously with issues of American politics, history, and racial identity than any of its contempories. It is a film urgently needed DVD restoration restoring it to its original widescreen format with audio-commentaries by Fuller critics of the caliber of Bill Krohn and Jonathan Rosenbaum. Hopefully, some enterprising company should begin to do this soon.",1124236800,35,2777,5.0

I must admit at the time it wasn't my favorite of war movies and I, too, found it boring.  I saw it again for the second time last night and realized that it was a great movie - I was just to young to appreciate it at the time.  Also, when it came out, there was not the historical significance or relevance there is today as we had no involvement as a country in Vietnam (Indochina then). The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, sound is fine, and Max Steiner's musical score is easily recognizable - if you are a Steiner fan. The black and white treatment at the time was typical of Fuller and adds to the harshness of the movies. My only complaint today would be with Amazon for the ridiculous price increase since I purchased it a few weeks ago. (60% from $18 - $30).  I am glad I bought it when I did.  Wait for it and the price will likely drop.

331020,2,6301358570,"Only a few movies deal with the French-era war in Vietnam, and ""China Gate"" is one. It has some interesting features. Here is an early appearance by Angie Dickinson, one of the great bombshells of the 60s. Gene Barry, often cast as a neat professor or a very dapper rogue, essays a bearded, hard-as-nails character. Nat ""King"" Cole has a dramatic role, and does nicely with it. (He does get to sing the title song.) Still, the film's approach to the tangled conflict among French colonial overlords, Vietnamese communist rebels and Americans offering firepower is creaky and dated. ""China Gate's"" documentary-style introduction could have been done more forcefully---and understandably---as dramatic scenes. The film seems to be shot entirely on sound stages, and suffers by comparison with the on-location production values of such (admittedly) larger works as ""Bridge On The River Kwai.""

Fuller was a filmmaker of his time, a time that produced a lot of high-octane B-films that are the real deal when it comes to grit. China Gate has more to it about the Vietnam conflict than any other film i've seen, and this was eight years before it got hot and Americanized, that's how far ahead he was in knowing where the action was going to be, and where it had been, with the French up till Dien Bien Phu.  I don't like his politics, but i do his passion and guts for his subject matter. He tells a story well, no matter the political point of view. There's enough intelligent sociological observation in this film to equal that which is in the rest of war films combined.

7811895,2,6301358570,"OK, most racist film EVER! Sure Nat King Cole is it, but they way Asians are depicted - GROTESQUE. I'm not sure why people respect Samuel Fuller. This film is a crappy B movie shot entirely on a sound stage in Hollywood. Filled with cheesy, racist and stereotypical scenes. Nothing insightful at all in this film. Makes Ed Wood Jr. look like David O. Selznick.",1481587200,,360,4.553846153846154
7811896,5,6301358570,"I saw this on TV prior to going to Vietnam. It gave me a little background on the struggles of the everyday Vietnamese people and I carried that with me over there. I worked with the ARVN quite a lot and made friends with them unlike so many other GIs. Getting to know them on a personal level made quite a difference and we formed a bond/trust that still stands to this day.
I never understood why Nat King Coles title song never hit the charts. I always liked the song and thought about it off and on over the years. When I googled the title of the movie I was happy to find a DVD of it and bought it right away. It arrived quickly and I watched that evening.  It is nice to see this again. I highly recommend it with 5 stars. My copy has no flaws",1475452800,2,749,3.993333333333333
