Not quite the same dramatic results but 4-5 shots better.  Almost hard to believe.  Shared it with my nephew, same results and he's on a Division I golf team. I leave it running while I'm at my desk doing paper work.",1335744000,,370,4.257142857142857
7900058,5,7880449809,"I really didn't know what to expect, but I watched the driving scene twice before I was about to play. For the last year, I cannot hit driver. I always duck hook my shot and barely get any loft on it. I used my driver 3 times on 9 holes and hit the ball about 240-250 straight with some loft. I still can't believe it. My buddy thinks I'm lying. This product is wonderful and easy. Watch and play.",1302566400,2,397,4.037974683544304
