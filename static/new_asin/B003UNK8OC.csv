8426304,5,B003UNK8OC,"Zhao Liang's often funny and always shocking documentary on a border community
police station shows us young and industrious policemen who are, in turns, meticulous,
bewildered, and livid. A large portion of the film is focused on two events: a pickpocket
who trashes his cell phone, and a scrap collector working without a permit. Both
men may be innocent, but suffer casual abuse by the police who themselves bemoan
the stress and lack of respect they bear. ""Crime and Punishment"" is a marvel; Zhao
forgoes easy outrage for measured observation and the film seems to suggest that under
China's current law enforcement system, neither the enforcers nor the criminals can win.",1285545600,,676,5.099099099099099
8426305,5,B003UNK8OC,"I learned about the director of this documentary, Zhao Liang, from another one of his award-winning documentaries, Petition. It is clear from both documentaries that Zhao is someone who actively concerns himself with the actual treatment of ordinary people under the authoritarian rule of Communist China. The scarcity of intervention from his part, as is evident from his work, especially the lack of voice-over-narration and music, gives us ample room to make up our own mind as to how to approach the issues depicted in the films. Though sometimes embarrassingly static, his camera is never offering us an indifferent gaze, but one that spells out the virtue and work ethics of today's documentary filmmakers, which ought to be appreciated by anyone who is ready for a good dose of reality.",1280707200,,793,5.107692307692307
