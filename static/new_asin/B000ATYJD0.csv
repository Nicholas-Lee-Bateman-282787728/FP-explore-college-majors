8079834,1,B000ATYJD0,"Hey there everyone. Spare yourself the embarrassment of showing this video to students/kids and just teach bike safety yourself. I have been a cycling instructor for the past 5 years and a parent gave this to me a year ago with a cringe. ""Ehhhh!' It's clearly a strong attempt from a low budget operation and something that's more fit for 10+ years ago. I wish someone would make a strong attempt to create a better, cooler video that's fit for today's young audiences.",1364428800,,469,4.662650602409639
8079835,1,B000ATYJD0,"This video contains inappropriate content - visuals of women reclining in bikinis as a ""humorous"" attempt to get the audiences attention. The entire video is simply an excuse to use gimmicky and distracting special effects. There is very little actual safety information here.
Can I give this a zero star rating?",1255910400,,312,5.137254901960785
8079836,5,B000ATYJD0,In my 14 years of teaching safety videos become more and more outdated.  Safety on wheels is an eye catching video that will hold students attention from start to finish!!  The Sarge has really out done himself.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!!!!,1139788800,3,263,4.4375
