1894868,5,B00009WVME,Olivier gives his usual  200 % Best...but CONSTANCE CUMMINGS  as the Mother  steals the show.....A BRILLIANT  HEARTBREAKING portrayal  of a tragic  addict who is in Denial of the truth of her condition...,1386979200,3,204,5.21875
1894869,3,B00009WVME,"It is a disappointment!  That simple.  It is so boring I fell asleep on the couch.  The dvd in no way compares to seeing this play on stage with Jo Van Fleet as Mary, and James Foxworthy as Jamie.  The actors in this dvd just appear to be a vehicle to deliver their lines.  No conviction or enthusiam.  I would steer clear, if you know what's good for you.",1372032000,3,356,4.086956521739131
1894870,5,B00009WVME,Sir Laurence Olivier is magnificent in this version of the O'Neill family drama. Produced for television and shot on video tape.,1144713600,11,128,5.142857142857143
1894871,2,B00009WVME,"I'm a high school AP English teacher, and I bought both the Peter Wood and Sidney Lumet versions of Long Day's Journey into Night, and while Lumet's version isn't totally satisfying, I find it far superior to Wood's version.  I'm amazed, in fact, that anyone would recommend this version.  Olivier is very good as James Tyrone, but the other actors give weak performances, and the camerawork lacks any creativity.  Katharine Hepburn and Jason Robards are excellent in the Lumet version, and there are numerous interesting staging and cinematic choices.",1107820800,19,552,5.179775280898877
1894872,5,B00009WVME,"I am delighted to be able to add this to my DVD collection.  This production of the play is easily the finest ever put on film or tape, infinitely superior to that rather tired film with Katherine Hepburn and Ralph Richardson.  This was taped in the studio after a famed production of the play was a major success at England's National Theatre.
Olivier's James Tyrone is indelible, the only actor I have ever seen to make the character a real living person rather than a hard-hearted tyrant.  Olivier's performance is heart breaking, one of the most beautiful and moving performances I've ever seen.  His James Tyrone manages to be achingly human and sad at all times, without ever once sugar-coating the character's less admirable qualities.  That the same can be said of Constance Cummings as Mary Tyrone, and Denis Quilley and Ronald Pickup as Jamie and Edmund is a tribute to an overall magnificent cast.
A more than worthy addition to anyone's DVD library, and vital viewing for anyone interested in watching a great performance of a great play.
All in all, this is a great feast of acting for those willing to sit still and watch it with the attention it deserves.  It doesn't get better than this.",1070150400,53,1204,4.7368421052631575
1894873,2,B00009WVME,"Long Days Journey Into Night was the classic struggle about man battling with his fate.  I thought the movie was alright, but not really my kind of flick.  For drama lovers it would probably be a little better.  It lacked any real action or entertainment from my point of view, but kept my interest somewhat.  The acting was very good, however the plot was very depressing and sad, it's not a very uplifting movie whatsoever.",1067472000,2,425,4.626666666666667
1894874,3,B00009WVME,"After viewing this movie, I thought that it was exactly like any other movie I've viewed in school, boring.  While many critics may argue that this was a great piece of art by O'neill, I found it to be three hours of mediocre drama.  This is not to say that this film didn't have its interesting parts though.  I thought the actors did a wonderful job depicting the lives of the family members and i felt as though this really added to the quality of the movie.  Overall I give this movie 3 stars because It was rather boring but it did have its high spots.",1067472000,,557,4.226415094339623
1894875,4,B00009WVME,"Eugene O'neills compelling play Long Days Journey Into Night reflects the struggle between man and his fate.  Though lacking the action packjed climax we find in todays movies.  Lo9ng Days journey Into NIght focuses on capturing the complexity of the Characters problems and struggles.  This film uses incredible photography and camera angles to express an individuals state of mind.  At some points throughout this film it lost its ability to engage an audience , as a live play would, however the parts that did caprture the audience left one questioning ones own fate and the upward struggle we all face.  Overall this film was captivating and truely posesses the essence of O'Neill.  Very Good, Captivating film.",1067472000,4,716,5.129310344827586
1894876,5,B00009WVME,"I prefer the Katharine Hepburn version overall but this one I will
buy just for the magnificence of Constance Cummings.  Olivier got
an Emmy and huzzahs at the time but I don't really believe his
James Tyrone. But Cummings is Mary Tyrone.  Just watching her
in her closeups as the morphine-addicted mother, haunted by her
past.  There have been some wonderful Mary Tyrones recently.
Vanessa Redgrave and Jessica Lange were fabulous too.  But each
one had a little different interpretation and all are valid I
think.  But Cummings is right up there with the best.  I still hope
someone puts her shattering portrayal in WINGS on video.  It deserves to be preserved too.",1059350400,30,667,4.849557522123894
1894877,3,B00009WVME,"For those of you who are thrilled to pieces to have found that this brilliant work will be released on DVD, I might have some bad news for you. I took the liberty to e-mail the President of the studio which is producing this DVD, and he informed me that the version is one from 1973 starring Laurence Olivier. And while Olivier was no slouch as an actor, I think most people will continue to view the 1962 film version to be the superior production. However you feel about it, I thought it would be nice to know what product you are considering. I hope it helps.",1056067200,75,562,4.261682242990654

7993834,5,B00009WVME,A MUST purchase.  Thank you Amazon.  A hard to find DVD.  A must for your collection.  LO is is superb as usual and Michael Redgrave is brilliant as Uncle Vanya.,1439510400,,161,4.266666666666667
7993835,4,B00009WVME,One reason to have this : Constance Cummings. She truly succeeds in making Mary Tyrone Timeless. Any 'classical' actress should have it.,1426032000,,136,5.2272727272727275
7993836,4,B00009WVME,"Several extraordinarily powerful moments, but on the whole, it suffers because the format of filming a stage performance introduces the old bugaboo of actors rushing through their lines. The inherent power of this play is very often in the pacing of the spoken words. And, although a full performance of the play usually takes close to four hours, cuts that need to be made should be done so with the utmost care, which this production lacked. As close to heresy as this may be for me, as an actor, to say, the performance given by Laurence Olivier doesn't rank among his best. The other principal actors filled their roles competently, but that's about all.",1424390400,3,658,4.780701754385965

7993838,5,B00009WVME,I love the writing of O'Neill and I love Lawrence Olivier's acting ability.  This is a great classic play and I have seen many versions of it.  I never get tired of this tragic story and seeing great actors portray the characters.  I was pleased to find this version and promise you will not get disappointed if you ad it to to your movie collection.,1402185600,2,350,4.3538461538461535
7993839,1,B00009WVME,"I ordered this cos' I heard it was good with a stellar performance by Olivier and Constance Cummings. The idiots who put this together should state in the packaging it has no captioning whatsoever for us hearing-impaired individuals. Since it is a live TV broadcast from the 70s, they did not have captioning capabilities back then. I get  that. But then the idiots have had ample time to make the DVD accessible for the hearing-impaired all these many years. Bah! Humbug! to them. Not worth the trouble, although Olivier got an Emmy and Cummings was nominated for one. Great performances is what they say, but I cannot understand what the hell they are saying. Very frustrating and not worth the trouble. Pooey, pooey!",1401840000,6,719,4.845528455284553
7993840,5,B00009WVME,"Eugene O'Neill's seminal work is treated brilliantly largely thanks to Lord Olivier's iconic portrayal of the bitter James Tyrone. Considered by many to be the greatest American drama, ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" deals with the tragedy of drug addiction, alcoholism, ""consumption,"" and a plethora of life's regrets spilled onto the stage in shocking detail. The Tyrones are each haunted by memories of what could have been, and tortured by the reality of how their lives played out. Largely autobiographical, the play has been performed by some of the world's best know actors. None are better here than Olivier.",1395878400,,616,5.232323232323233
