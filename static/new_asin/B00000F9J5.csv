1205727,3,B00000F9J5,"MR. IMPERIUM is, not surprisingly, one of the lesser titles in Lana Turner's resume.  Not even her beauty and charm can save this lumbering turkey of a musical.

Turner plays Fredda Barlo, an American cabaret star who becomes romanced by a down-to-earth member of European royalty--known simply as Mr. Imperium (and played by talented opera basso Ezio Pinza).  Featured in thankless supporting roles are Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main.

Fans of musicals are likely to enjoy it (despite a song about ""presto anti-pasto""--what the...?).  There's a reason why this movie is now in Public Domain.",1195603200,10,595,5.221052631578948
1205803,1,B00000F9J5,Very poor film quality..did diminish the movie.,1469577600,,47,5.857142857142857
1205804,4,B00000F9J5,Entertaining and refreshing.  Music was enjoyable.  Nice not to be assaulted by verbal and visual immorality.,1465257600,,109,5.75
1205805,3,B00000F9J5,"It was a nice story, but it wasn't one of my favorite Lana Turner movies.",1458000000,,73,3.933333333333333
1205806,2,B00000F9J5,Watched it for Debbie Reynolds. Not nearly enuf of her..,1455148800,,56,4.7
1205807,1,B00000F9J5,Don't know what happened but the print was black and white and lousy. The Film Detective should give out refunds for sending out prints like this.,1448496000,,146,4.653846153846154
1205808,3,B00000F9J5,"Well, it didn't suck.  It is fine for background, while doing chores.  The short screen time of Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main was actually the most entertaining.  Turner, obviously, wasn't in her best frame of mind, and didn't deliver a convincing performance.  And where did they get this Pinza guy? He may have been a great Emile, in South Pacific, on Broadway, but that charm didn't translate to film. That's not even mentioning the absolute void where the chemistry should be, between the lead lovers.  The ending leaves you with a feeling that nothing is resolved.",1444694400,,573,4.927083333333333
1205809,2,B00000F9J5,Kind of simplistic.,1440720000,,19,5.666666666666667
1205810,4,B00000F9J5,Very enjoyable.  Would have given it a five star but always love the happy ending.,1440288000,,82,4.466666666666667
1205811,5,B00000F9J5,"If you like continual singing/opera, this is the movie for you. Lana is wonderful.",1435104000,,82,4.928571428571429
1205812,4,B00000F9J5,Charming video from the 50's. Enjoyed it!,1434067200,,41,5.0
1205866,2,B00000F9J5,"Wow--people who gave this a positive review must have very low standards or maybe haven't seen many movies. The plot is worth filiming, and with the right cast, script and just about everything else, it could have been a pretty good movie. But it never gets off the ground. Interesting to see Lana Turner at the beginning doing a Betty Grable turn. Pinza is just boring and not very attractive, but who can account for women's taste? The scenes with Marjorie Main and Debbie Reynolds were hokey and dull. I watched the version that came in the ""50 Classic Musicals"" package, and the quality was bad. I can understand why at least one viewer didn't think it was in color.",1432771200,,670,4.591666666666667
1205867,2,B00000F9J5,Very Dated concept here. Ezio Pinza has a ghoulish charm. Lana turner is too prudish. There is no chemistry between them. She acts like he has bad breath in the closeups and he probably does. Pass on this one...,1430784000,,211,4.435897435897436
1205868,3,B00000F9J5,Lana Turner is beautiful in this corny classic with a predictable plot,1425168000,,70,4.916666666666667
1205869,1,B00000F9J5,"This film has not aged well. It comes across as overly theatrical and dramatic, almost comical when it is not intended to be a comedy.",1420588800,,134,4.4
1205870,2,B00000F9J5,Depression era movie with simple romantic story. Valuable as time piece.,1419984000,,72,5.636363636363637
1205871,3,B00000F9J5,"Nice hooky old movie with a good look at Lana.
Reminders of a nice more naive and innocent time.
Gratuitous xxx=0; gunfire=0; screaming posing as acting=0; KungFuing=0
Great views of a less crowded, less anxious, less hurried world.",1418860800,,232,5.131578947368421
1205872,3,B00000F9J5,Not one of Lana Turner's  best films but enjoyable.,1417219200,,51,4.666666666666667
1205873,4,B00000F9J5,It was very good.,1413676800,,17,3.5
1205874,5,B00000F9J5,Movie was really great and I enjoyed the story unfolding though I was surprised at the ending. Sis not really recognize Reynolds until the credits ran. She is not very tall and her hair was dark. But she let her presence in the movie be felt though only for a short time.,1399161600,2,271,4.230769230769231
1205875,3,B00000F9J5,"I was disappointed in the film.  Yes, I had primarily chosen the film to hear Ezio Pinza sing, but ...  He did little of it, and inferior songs.  Seeing an 18 year-old Debbie Reynolds was fun - her bouncy vitality was there, although the part left something to be desired.
An o.k. film if your expectations are not too high.",1391472000,3,324,4.366666666666666
1205945,5,B00000F9J5,"I totally loved this movie.  I would highly recommend for hopeless romantics, or those who want to escape the woes of reality for a true love store.",1386547200,3,148,4.481481481481482
1205946,3,B00000F9J5,We needed more of Debbie Reynolds!  Lana Turner did a nice job but Ezio wasn't the right actor for the lead.  Debbie Reynolds stole the show.,1386201600,,141,4.384615384615385
1205947,4,B00000F9J5,If you love the grandeur in which the money was spent lavishly to build the set...this is one of them. GREAT COLOR.,1367798400,2,115,4.2727272727272725
1205948,2,B00000F9J5,I' did not watch the whole movie.  I like musicals but I just didn't care for the music in this one.  The story line was really flimsy.  No one is that in love in such a short time.  I just couldn't watch the whole thing.  The scenery was beautiful so I gave it 2 stars.,1363737600,,270,3.8363636363636364
1205949,5,B00000F9J5,"Ezio Pinza's voice is just to die for, and he is such a gallant gentleman. A sweet romance with a bit of a twist, but I truly enjoyed it. So much so that I had to own it for myself.",1353283200,,181,3.55
1205950,2,B00000F9J5,"The DVD-R offered of Mr. Imperium can only be described as a poor stopgap until one can get a copy from Turner Classic Movies, the company now selling Mr. Imperium from a master transfer. I was disappointed by the overall quality of the film, while the Technicolor is obviously washed out. The movements in the film are hesitant -- even jerky. I enjoy this film very much, but the quality of this transfer rates very low. So again, Buyer Beware!",1300492800,,445,4.575
1205951,5,B00000F9J5,This is the movie that introduced Ezio Pinza to me.  Upon investigation I found a wonderful singer not only for opera but popular music as well.,1299369600,3,144,4.538461538461538
1205952,3,B00000F9J5,"I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Debbie Reynolds, and she has a small part in it. I was also a fan of Lana Turner. I think the movie was okay because those two actresses had a good performance. It doesn't matter that the storyline was quirky or unbelievable, or that the singing wasn't sounding great, the movie as a whole can be enjoyed by watching the glamorous Lana Turner and cute Debbie Reynolds. The leading man was the only turnoff. Lana supposedly couldn't stand him when filming the movie, but it didn't show in the film. But he wasn't that handsome, he doesn't deserve Lana Turner.",1249344000,,599,4.504587155963303
1205953,3,B00000F9J5,"The good times for Lana Turner at MGM were well and truly over when she was assigned to star in a minor ""masterpiece"" entitled MR. IMPERIUM.  It's not so surprisingly one of the lesser titles in Lana Turner's resume. Not even her beauty and charm can save this lumbering turkey of a musical.

1205954,1,B00000F9J5,first this movie is not in color. second there is initials in the lower right hand corner of the film that is very distracting. third the sound is terrible. i saw this movie on tv and it was in color. so don't buy this.,1217376000,13,219,4.0
7907424,1,B00000F9J5,It clearly says Technicolor.  It is not color it is black and white and the quality is very poor.,1518480000,,97,4.105263157894737
7907425,5,B00000F9J5,"I'm tired of all the reviews in which people just complain about poor quality film and don't rate the content/story. I think that although this wasn't a perfect film, it was very enjoyably and not half as disparate as the comparable films of the period! I would probably give it an honest 4 stars, but wanted to offset some of the unfair one-star reviews that skew the overall rating.",1500422400,,384,4.579710144927536

7907427,4,B00000F9J5,"Good romance like most old classics - with the beauty of Italy in the background, I liked the storyline - a tiny bit sad, but overall, a nice movie.  It does have some songs in it, which is not my fave thing, but not at all overkill like some ""musicals"".",1496361600,,254,4.08
7907428,5,B00000F9J5,If you love Pinza you will love this film. He's extremely charismatic and the voice is magnificent!,1494806400,,99,4.882352941176471
7907429,5,B00000F9J5,Old time fun.  Great for those of us who like the older flicks.,1489449600,,63,3.8461538461538463
7907430,1,B00000F9J5,"Really didn't care for this at all. Lana must have been desperate thinking her career was ending to have taken this movie. NO chemistry between her and Ezio Pinza.  The ending was lousy. A real waste of time except for the few scenes with a just starting out, adorable Debbie Reynolds.",1486080000,,285,4.588235294117647
7907431,1,B00000F9J5,I watched this because it had Debbie Reynolds in it (a teen at the time). A phony movie with a nothing plot. I missed it in 1950 and shouldn't have wasted my time.,1484265600,,163,3.9696969696969697
