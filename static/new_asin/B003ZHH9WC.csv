8410309,4,B003ZHH9WC,Great office comedy with a Canadian flavour that's not only hysterical but clever at times. Made a fan out of me...too bad only the first season has been released on DVD.,1394582400,,170,4.516129032258065
8410310,5,B003ZHH9WC,"absolutely one of the funniest canadian tv shows ever.  witty and super well written.  Brandon Firla is incredibly funny( little mosque CBC fame), Jennifer Baxter ( from urban legends and absolutely beautiful lady), and Fab Fillipo (queer as folk violinist) my guess is horrible time slot or lack of advertising.  a MUST see!",1367452800,2,325,5.09433962264151
