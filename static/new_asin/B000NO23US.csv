2772739,1,B000NO23US,"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD.  The audio was poor, the acting was not very good, even the sets lacked a professional polish.

2772743,1,B000NO23US,"Normally, I like to go against the grain of things and critique movies for myself. And sometimes, I find critics to be wrong. In this case, I should kick myself two times in the behind for wasting my money on this, and not taking the advice of the other critics. This is really bad. I can't believe that this was released. Was it even edited. I think that this movie is an insult to the entire Black playwrighting experience. Great movie title. POOR MOVIE.",1249257600,12,456,4.440476190476191
