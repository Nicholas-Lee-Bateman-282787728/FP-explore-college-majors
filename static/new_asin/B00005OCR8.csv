1641259,5,B00005OCR8,"I loved the book by Barbra Robinson when I read it and I thought the movie was just as good! It is pretty funny,esspecialy when Gladys yells,""Hey! Unto you a child is born!"".I love that part!

Any way its a play/movie with a lot of laughs and if they messed up as many times as us it would be even funnier.

I TELL YOU WATCH IT!!!

1641261,5,B00005OCR8,"I have never seen the movie, but if it is anything like the play or the book, then you will love it. I played Beth Bradley, the narrator. Our Director, Patrick McBride, helped us with our charachters and had us look at things from the herdman's point of veiw.  If the movie is anything lke the play, you will love it.

1641262,5,B00005OCR8,"The Herdmans are the worst kids ever!  They cuss, they smoke, they torture animals and people.  AND they want to be in the church Christmas pageant, even though they have never heard the story of Christmas.  This movie truly captures the true meaning of Christmas.  See Faruza Baulk as a little girl as she narrates the story.  I highly recommend reading the book first.  It's a fast and easy read.  It makes the movie SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.",1061424000,51,442,4.589743589743589

1641264,4,B00005OCR8,"Based on the children's novel by Barbara Robinson, with teleplay by the author of the book (hurray!), this video remains true to the book by the same name.  A local church is doing the Christmas pageant for Christmas, and the family of 6 unsupervised, undisciplined children decide to get involved. They bully the other children so that they will get the main roles. Everyone is worried that this will be the WORST Christmas Pageant because the Herdmans are involved. The mother, played by Loretta Swit (MASH), shows patience and diligence, with unending hope that the whole thing will have a great ending. Despite the fact that I've been reading this book aloud to my  elementary school students for years, I ended up in tears during the scene where Imogene discovers what Mary is all about.  Definitely, OWN this video if you love what Christmas is really about!",1008374400,161,864,4.863945578231292
1641265,5,B00005OCR8,"This has got to be one of the funniest Xmas stories ever. Where else can you find a gang of pre-homicidal teenagers living in a garage? And, they want to put on the school play? Nice. (...) It's a really good book too. Read the book first before you see the movie, you'll thank me later according to the prophecy.",1007596800,18,313,4.233333333333333

1641273,5,B00005OCR8,"This is one of my wife's favorite!
This is the story of a Christmas pageant at a church that quickly starts to become a complete disaster and only gets worse when the Herdmans get involved. Having never been to church before or even knowing anything about the biblical Christmas story, the Herdmans live up to their reputation of being abusive to each other and the other children. The worst Christmas pageant ever, in its darkest moment, has a miraculous redemption and becomes the Best Christmas Pageant Ever!",1516924800,,511,4.885057471264368

1641281,4,B00005OCR8,"I absolutely loved this book as a child.  It's a funny but thought provoking story.  Barbara Robinson, the author of this book, also wrote the screenplay, which features Loretta Swit from M.A.S.H. as the mom running the church Christmas pageant, which happens to include six delinquent children from the Herdman family, who have never heard the Christmas Story before.

Caution:  This movie does show a young girl (age 11-12) smoking a cigar in the church bathroom (although it's made very clear that it's not approved of).",1514937600,,523,5.046511627906977

1641292,2,B00005OCR8,"I grew up watching a VHS copy we recorded from television back in the early '80s.  I have seen this so many times, I could recite it verbatim.  I was very excited to buy this, but soooooo disappointed in the product.  The picture and the sound are okay.  Not great, but better than my old copy.  However, the problem lies in the fact that there are several scenes cut from this DVD.  It happens at each spot where the commercials were meant to be.  The scene abruptly cuts off.  Kind of like how with some VHS players, if you hit the pause button while recording, the tape would reverse several seconds.  I feel like that's what happened here.  That this DVD company just took an old VHS copy, and recorded it to DVD.  It's certainly better than nothing, but I would recommend tracking down a VHS copy and then recording it to DVD.  That's what I had to do.  The product you'll end up with has about the same video quality, and it doesn't have all the choppy cuts.",1506124800,,964,4.318435754189944

The kids learn through participating in a Christmas pageant what it means to truly accept and love people who are different than you! It  also has more adult laughs as the children's mother has to direct the play at the last minute and navigate some difficult decisions. This movie is great for older children I would say 7 and above. It gives you as the parent the ability to talk about the reason for Christmas, accepting those who are different than you and how to respond in a Christ like manner.

The movie is in keeping to the story Barbara Robinson wrote and stars Loretta Switt, a personal favorite of mine.  It's a quick watch and a beautiful reminder of what the first Christmas truly was.

The story tells of the intersection of the Herdmann kids with a group of classmates who are active in the local church.  Wild, supported by welfare and without supervision, the Herdmann's stumble into church and the annual Christmas pageant. In the starring roles with no understanding of story of Christmas, the Herdmann's learn about the true meaning of the season while teaching an entire community what that first Christmas probably was like.

1641624,3,B00005OCR8,"My wife and I got this movie as she grew up with it and had fond memories of it as a child.  We showed it to our own children.  It is cute if a bit choppy.  It is very early 80's which is fine and I didn't expect fine art.  The actors are all vaguely OK (L Switt doing just great) but there is a lot of mugging going on.  The Herdman children have dirty faces where the dirt is applied ""just so"" by the makeup crew, which made me smile.  Overall, I totally get what the movie (and I assume the book, although I haven't read it) is going for.  Everyone needs to be accepted, everyone can be touched by the Xmas story, etc..  However, I was deeply disappointed in the church and its members.  At no time did an adult take charge of the situation and really intervene with the situation the Herdman children were in.  The Pastor was shown as only concerned that they were too much trouble.  He seemed unconcerned about their welfare, whether the mother could use some assistance from the Church or whether the children were going hungry.  The lady running the paegent was concerned with the children being there and on time but other than that seemed to show little ocmpassion towards the Herdman children.  A child is caught smoking a cigar in the church and this is mistaken for a real fire to good comic effect.  But the why/how/what and adult would do if a child were smoking cigars in the church was not addressed.  Over and over again adults rolled their eyes at these children and let them run wild even in their own church.  I understand they can't go to their house and parent for this lady necessarily, but you can control things much better that happen on your own turf.  And you can offer a clear caring hand up to these children, that simply was NOT portrayed as happening.  I had a lot of questions about whether the people who attended that church had any care for their community beyond making children do a Paegent once a year.",1354233600,,1941,4.35933147632312

1641644,5,B00005OCR8,"My favorite story about the Herdmans remains the first: The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. It best shows off Barbara Robinson's strengths. For example, who wouldn't want to keep reading after its famous introduction? Only after it does Robinson takes a step back to tell us who the Herdmans are. In another sign of her craftsmanship, rather than simply telling us how bad the Herdmans are, Robinson expounds upon one of their bad acts: the burning down of an old tool house. While not making light of fires, Robinson still manages to present it from the perspective of an eleven-year-old: ""It was a terrific fire--two fire engines and two police cars and all the volunteer fireman and five dozen doughnuts."" Robinson also deftly juggles seriousness with humor: The fire chief gathered the kids together to give them a little talk about the dangers of playing with matches and gasoline. Of course, the only lesson the Herdmans learned was ""wherever there's a fire there will be free doughnuts sooner or later"". Within the next few chapters, we read about several more disasters involving the Herdmans--and learn that their father disappeared when the youngest was two years old (and no one blamed him), their mother works double shifts at the shoe factory (and no one blamed her either), their home is over a garage, and they own the meanest looking cat. Finally, before The Best Christmas Pageant risks slipping into a rut of episodes, Robinson throws out this hook: ""We figured that they were headed straight for hell, by way of the state penitentiary ... until they got themselves mixed up with the church, and my mother, and our Christmas pageant."" Clocking in at a mere eighty pages, The Best Christmas Pageant is a quick-paced chapter book filled with quirky anecdotes that left readers clamoring for more tales about the Herdmans.",1317427200,,1834,4.957792207792208

For me, this film is now a piece of nostalgia with some laughs, but not much more. Don't get me wrong, as far as made for tv Christmas flicks, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is better than most.

The storyline is decent. This movie is about a family of impoverished children who are rough, tough and know nothing about the bible. Well, they soon take part in a Christmas play with perfectly well dressed, polite Christian children and adults. This story is made for laughs, and the dialogue is very funny.

Loretta Swit (of TV's M*A*S*H* fame) is the headliner of this film.  She does a great job as the woman who has to take on the job of directing her church's annual Christmas pageant when another woman has an accident and can't do it.  She bucks up and marches in to take on the task, but she didn't count on the Herdmann children showing up.

The Herdmanns were a gaggle of 6 completely unruly unsupervised kids that terrorize their school and town and all the kids in it.  When they volunteer to be the 6 main characters in the pagent none of the other kids dare speak up, so there Loretta Swit is, saddled with the Herdmanns as Joseph, Mary, the three wise men, and the Angel of the Lord, only they don't know ANYTHING about the real Christmas story.

Just imagine what you would have thought if you were hearing the Christmas story for the first time!

This film is well worth watching. Of course, some of the acting leaves a bit to be desired, but I have to say that my favorite characters are Jackson Davies who plays Loretta Swit's husband and the youngest Hermann, Gladys.

The movie has plenty of comedic moments, but more importantly it shows that no matter what a child's background may be, there is an innocence there even though it may be masked by layers of dirt and bruises.

1641678,5,B00005OCR8,"This made for TV movie based on the book by Barbara Robinson does not feature the best actors or technical credits.  In fact, some of the actors appear to be amateurs and the film, shot in Canada, was probably done on a barebones budget.  But if you are the kind of viewer that can look beyond these shortcomings and you would enjoy a Christmas themed film with a deeper message than most of the typical irreligious holiday fare, then you may appreciate this movie.  Second, because the story is set in a time significantly different from our own (although not that long ago), it provides some thought-provoking commentary on where we are headed as a society.

The story is a cheerful comedy about the annual Christmas program at a typical small town/small-city church.  The most feared family of young troublemakers in the community, the six Herdman siblings, take it into their heads to start attending Sunday School because of the free food.  As a result, they hear about the upcoming Christmas pageant and decide they want all the major roles--Mary, Joseph, the three Wise Men and the lead angel.  The other children are so frightened of them that they don't try for these parts themselves, leaving the lead roles to the Herdmans.  The Herdmans turn out to be completely ignorant of the Biblical account of the birth of Jesus.  Their ignorance of the Bible and their rough ways make everyone in the church fear that the pageant will be a riotous failure. But the Herdmans hear the Christmas story with fresh ears and open hearts, transforming the routine and humdrum Christmas pageant in the process.

There is a profound and very old truth at the heart of this story--that it is often the social outcasts and misfits who best appreciate the coming of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.  They are the ones who recognize their need for a Savior, as they are not self-satisfied and complacent because of their abilities, achievements, wealth, education and activities.  Everyone except for the Herdmans are too familiar with the Christmas story, to the point that they miss its real meaning.  But because the Herdmans catch a glimpse of the real wonder and power of the birth of Jesus, the Christmas pageant is transformed for the entire church.

My daughter was in a children's theater production of this drama.  Many of the children in her play were like the Herdmans in one regard---they were not familiar with the basic Bible stories, including the Nativity.  What has changed since this story was written is that it has become the norm for families to not attend church and to raise their families in complete ignorance of the Bible, whether as a religious text or simply one of the great foundational writings of human history.  This development makes the story dated in that less viewers appreciate, let alone understand, the contrast between the Herdmans and their neighbors.  Skipping the obvious question of what Biblical illiteracy means for our society, I am at least comforted by the record of the Herdmans.  Perhaps more people in our day will hear the Christmas story with honest interest and open ears, considering whether or not the baby Jesus came into this world for their benefit.",1233446400,11,3206,4.860294117647059

I disagree with the comments regarding quality.  No, it hasn't been remixed for 5.1 surround sound or video quality improvements, but it looks just as good as it did in 1983 when it was broadcast on TV.  In reading the reviews before I ordered, I was concerned that it would look like a bootleg or something, but it does not.  It's just fine for what it is.",1199577600,4,629,4.098360655737705

A few years later, around the Christmas season, this movie was on tv. It follows the book very closely. It has such a good message regarding tollerance of others. The real lesson in this movie is learned by the mom(played by Loretta Swit). I bought this dvd for my parents, myself, and my in-laws a few years ago. We have all made it a tradition that when things get to crazed and we seem to loose our Christmas spirit,in the process of creating ""the perfect Christmas"", we pop in this DVD and get a good reminder of the most important part to the season. I cannot wait until my three are old enough to really enjoy this movie and understand the message behind it. I highly recommend this DVD to someone of any age.",1192665600,43,859,4.308641975308642
1641701,3,B00005OCR8,"This movie probably should be added to everyone's Christmas Season library.  Certainly not at the same level as 'A Christmas Carol' (Alistar Sim), 'Miracle on 34th St.' (John Payne, Maureen O'Hara), 'A Christmas Story', and other well-produced movies.  The story-line is nice; the only problem-  it's not developed enough.  I would certainly recommend reading the book first- it is BEAUTIFUL!  The characters are described in-depth, whereas the movie just 'skims' the personalities of the actors.  Loretta Switt (of the TV series M*A*S*H*) does a credible job, but I think if the producers would have tried to delve into the characters more, as well as alloted more time for the movie, it very well COULD have become a modern classic.  Still, a nice edition to one's Christmas collection.  But, be sure to read the book!",1189468800,,820,5.067164179104478

However, I was greatly suprised at the quality (or total lack thereof) during the film itself.  Not only was it dark and grainy, but parts of it changed color for a few split seconds at a time.  (Kind of looked like a homemade vcr to dvd conversion).

The movie is a great family friendly holiday movie....but I would definatley pass on this DVD edition unless it is an absolute favorite.  It would be much better to wait on a better future edition.",1168473600,8,651,4.666666666666667

1641707,3,B00005OCR8,"I was more than a little surprised when I discovered that there had been a film version of Barbara Robinson's beloved short story AND that (even more surprising to me) the only attempt to bring it to film was made 20 years ago...this year.

Since I have always loved the book (and make a point to read the story every Christmas), I put my $20 down on the cyber counter...without thinking...and purchased a copy. The DVD arrived in the mail today and as soon as I possibly could, I sat down to watch it...

Hmmmm...what can I say? Yes...I know...the movie was made in the 80's, and for television no less. BUT even with that in mind, I was still a little dissappointed with the production.

I agree with other reviewers that the acting was for the most part, quite excellent...but first rate performances were not enough to offset the second rate quality of the film itself, which had a faded, almost murky feel so common with television shows in the 80s (as I watched, I swear to you, images of ""Little House on The Prairie"" kept flashing before my eyes)...

Would I have purchased the DVD if I had known what I was going to see? The answer is: NO...I wouldn't have. Perhaps it's true that some stories just can't be translated to the screen. Or maybe, more true to the point, it's just that most people do not love this story as much as I do, and therefore are not interested in putting some real money behind it (and give it the production it deserves)...

We have a ka-zillion film and stage versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there...will someone please make JUST ONE more adaptation of this not-as-popular holiday classic...a film version that I can truly give five stars for...

FIVE STARS because to date, it's the only adaptation on Barbara Robinson's book, MINUS TWO STARS because the film production was so unworthy of such a great story...",1166054400,36,1851,4.577039274924472
