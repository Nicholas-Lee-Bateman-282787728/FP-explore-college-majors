8229100,4,B000XPXUF4,"As ""armchair"" tourists, as well as occasional travellers to Italy, my wife and I have viewed (and viewed again) the fine productions offered by Rudi Maxa, Burt Wolfe, Rick Steves and Samantha Brown.  They focus mostly on cities and hilltowns and do a fine job of interesting and orienting the traveller in their subjects.  Camille Abbe is lesser known but she and her producer/husband, Dekkan Abbe, offer a series of shows with equal production values and fine photography with the focus being on the Tuscan countryside.  Camille is an endearing on-screen presence, projecting a bit of naivety and plenty of engagement with her subject.  The series gets ""close to the ground"" and covers lots of ""stories"" and places not seen on other material.  Even if you also have other videos of Tuscany, this is well-worth adding to your collection.  Highly recommended!",1204502400,3,858,5.049645390070922
