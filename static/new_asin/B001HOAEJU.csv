8309251,5,B001HOAEJU,"This DVD along with most of the other products from this company have great educational/historical value.  Although quality on the older segment (Organized Crime Investigation) is not todays standards, it still gives the viewer a brief historical picture of Robert Kennedy's early campaigns.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in recent American history or for use as an educational tool.",1242864000,3,409,5.476190476190476
8309252,2,B001HOAEJU,"Robert Kennedy's speeches continue to be highly relevant today.  Unfortunately, this product's excerpts are unnecessarily short, with very uneven, and poor, sound quality.  A disappointment, as a result.",1230336000,6,203,6.214285714285714
