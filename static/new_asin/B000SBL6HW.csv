Each verse and line is broken down, it is very easy to follow. Plus you have the option of playing it over & over & over again, unlike being in class with others looking at you (Ok, me) side eye stinkeye kine. The DVD includes a booklet that can be downloaded and she includes everything you ever wanted to know about the song and dance, it is very complete. Its a great reference tool.

For those who have had hula training you will appreciate these instructions. For those who have not had basic hula training I suggest you start with her Basic Hula DVD first. Like anything else, if you master the fundamentals the rest comes easy. (Most times)

For me, THESE ISLANDS is a very homesick song. When dancing this song I think the mana'o of the singer/songwriter Danny Couch & the choreographer Kumu Kea hugs the audience. You will know that you have danced this song correctly when you see a person from Hawaii with tears in their eyes.",1188777600,6,1095,4.492462311557789
