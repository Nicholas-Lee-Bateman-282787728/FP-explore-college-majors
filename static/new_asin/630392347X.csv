I have seen this tape, literally over one hundred times, and I love it, as do all my  friends.  It makes me cry to thing that this show is not on the air  anymore.",912384000,,293,4.0

725119,4,630392347X,"I pretty much bought this VHS because I had loved the State back in the day and missed the days when a show could actually make me almost cry laughing.  This tape was a good visit to the good ol days of the State.  It includes almost ever part of the State that I loved and some more skits that I had never seen.  The one flaw about this tape though is that it is too short, and that this is the only tape of the State that I can find, and that there are actually no stickers included.

725120,5,630392347X,"If you like Airplane, the Naked Gun, The Pink Panther, or Gone With the Wind, you'll love The State.  Original laughs, subtle jokes, and trust me, you can watch it like 100 times.  Get it at any cost.",991267200,,200,4.2368421052631575
725121,5,630392347X,"America wasn't ready for the State, the unfortunately named comedy troupe who graced MTV's airwaves for an all-too-short period in the early 1990's. I was in high school at the time and I remember laughing hysterically and wondering why I was alone; why doesn't anyone else get this? Now that we are (hopefully) entering the post-gross-out comedy era, the State's unique brand of humor is a more socially acceptable commodity. Buy this today, you can't rent it anywhere and you must see it. To miss this work of genius would be a crime for anyone who is a fan of Monty Python or the more experimental elements of Saturday Night Live. I can not praise this tape, the last remnant of that wonderful show, enough.",989107200,2,710,4.688
725122,5,630392347X,"My friend Jules and I watch this movie all the time! We really have it memorized and the more we watch it the more we love it! It is the most hilarious thing I have ever seen, and something that no one should be without. I can't imagine living life without having seen the Porcupine racetrack, or heard Steve shout, ""POOR LITTLE CARL, WITH THE PUPPY DOG EYES! WE WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO DO HIS JOB!"" Every bit of this movie is just great!!",988675200,,436,4.2023809523809526
725123,4,630392347X,"Funny, funny show.
If you've never heard of The State, and are a fan of sketch comedy, I highly recommend you buy this video. Almost all of the skits are worth seeing and will make you laugh out loud. It's at least better than every sketch on Saturday Night Live that has appeared in the last five years.
However, if you faithfully watched every episode of The State when it premiered on MTV so many years ago, you are going to be disappointed. Every sketch will remind you of another sketch that's been left out of this oh-so-short video. You've got ""Monkey Torture"", but where is the ""Muppet Meat""?
If you're a fan of comedy, this is required viewing. But keep in mind that this just a small section of a greater work that will undoubtedly disappear forever.

725124,5,630392347X,"A lot of sketch comedy has a very short shelf-life, and what seemed so funny just a year ago is often stale and boring in the light of the present. This is not the case with the State. Several years after they single-handedly tripled MTV's average level of programming quality (somewhat faint praise, I know), their best work remains fresh and funny.
This compilation, ""Skits and Stickers (Stickers Not Included),"" is an excellent sampling of their work. It not only includes some of their best remembered sketches (such as Barry and Levon with the pudding and Louie at the Last Supper), but also some of their most ambitious material. Chief among the latter is the amazing ""Porcupine Racetrack,"" a send-up of big Hollywood musicals (think ""Guys & Dolls"" crossed with ""My Fair Lady""), complete with hilarious, tuneful and even touching songs. At moments like these, the group demonstrated that they were not interested simply in absurdity (though they excelled at it) but that they had the skill to turn pop-culture conventions on their head while still being absolutely faithful to them.
What made the State different from a lot of sketch comedy groups is that they always treated their targets with respect and rarely went for just the cheap laugh. Sometimes the jokes required a bit of thought to be fully appreciated, but that too is one of the elements that makes this material durable. There was a lot going on here, and the only thing I don't like about the tape is that it's a reminder that the group is no longer working together. Needless to say, if there's ever a reunion show, I'll be the first one in front of the TV.",983491200,5,1630,4.742957746478873
725125,5,630392347X,"I've looked for a state tape for years finally found it and it is quite simply the funniest sketch comedy around. Now I don't know the specifics but if mtv simply decided to cancel the show they don't know what they had...  It is super witty and yet extremely bass, which for my money is the best kind of comedy.  The real greatness of the state is it's pace. This video is a mile a minute assualt of doug, barry and lavon and louie... in closing where is that great skit of the variety show...  it was a pretty strange one but maaaaaaaaaaaaan was it funny...  ""would you stop kissing my former wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife""...  pure hilarity...  if you like sketch comedy just order you won't be dissappointed...",978825600,3,704,4.5476190476190474

I  thought my best friend and I were the only State-ers out there...I love  this video, and I am sooo saddened by the fact that The State is no longer  on TV.

725218,5,630392347X,"This was an amazing show, and it's a damn shame that it went off the air after 2 years and 3 1/2 seasons. This show exhibited some of the most original and goofy humor I've ever seen. Yes, the video omits some great  skits (Blueberry Johnson, Im-a Da Pope-a, Antonio: The Foreign Exchange  Student, and the Kabuki skit featuring Barry Toink, Doug, Barry &  LeVon, and Louie), but it's great as a memoir for us State fans. Luckily, I  had the foresight to tape several episodes during their original run, but  this collection has quite a few that I don't own. State fans, I say we band  together and urge Comedy Central to pick up the old The State episodes and  start airing them, or at least have a little weekend dedicated to this  amazing show. Who's with me!",959212800,16,762,4.431654676258993
725219,5,630392347X,"WOW! Nothing could ever be as hilarious as the short lived television show THE STATE! But, this video is the closest thing you'll find to it.

725221,3,630392347X,"YES!  This is The State we all know and love from years past.  Too bad it's off the air now.  This video will bring back memories, but it doesn't necessarily have the best of their material on it.  Like many other people  said, it's missing a lot of the best sketches (i.e. monkeys doing it, the  pope, etc..).  They should have made a longer tape or different volumes so  they wouldn't exclude the classic skits, but nevertheless, this is The  State, it's still hilarious, and it's worth every penny.  You may be  slightly disappointed about the missing sketches, though.",957312000,,572,4.6767676767676765
725222,3,630392347X,"Although i do love The State very much, there are too many good sketches left out and not so funny stuff put in, like the Porcupine Race sketch.  What happened to the Bluberry Johnson sketch, the monkeys doing it sketch,  and the muppet hunting sketch?

725226,5,630392347X,"It's amazing how much every single memory of an era comes back to you as soon as you watch this video.  The State was one of the best shows ever made and then it just dissapeared after only 2 seasons.  I'd like to urge  MTV to put out every single other skit The State ever had on other videos.  This will be the only way that you might be able to redeem yourselves for  ever cancelling the show that definded an era. I miss some of my favorite  skits such as ""The sideways house"" and ""The freak  show"".  The video is just hilarious but when you know that the show  was filmed for only 2 years and will never return, you want to get your  hands on every single episode.",950140800,,669,4.076923076923077
725227,5,630392347X,"This is a must see!  I too am sad that the State is no longer on.  I would do anything to get a hold of more of The State.  Monkey Torture was one of my favorites skits.  I still joke about that skit almost every time I see  my friends.  I've spent all night with a friend of mine ---Sonia---- Just  imitating the skits and making up more Monkey Torture Lines.  My friend  Angelica did her part as a great friend simply by introducing me to them.  I can laugh at any part of my day, just by thinking about The State.",950054400,2,516,3.9705882352941178

The selection of skits here is great and quite varied. There are a couple notable omissions including Captain Monterey Jack, Old Fashioned Guy and Hits from the 70s. However, if you love off-beat humor and want a good sample of what The State had to offer, this is a great introduction.",1188259200,,457,4.440476190476191

  I am so happy that some of the best skits are on the tape.  I too recorded my own tapes but they are getting old and worn out. I guess it helps to see the actors on random movies and tv shows, but it never compares to the show.

While the tape has skits featuring some of the most known characters like Doug (""I'm outta here....""), it only showcases one or two examples.  Some of my favorite skits aren't on the tape.  Still, for fans, it seems to be the only way to get a copy of any part of the show.  It is worth buying if you want to see a few good skits.

I've taped every episode and my tapes are starting to get worn out. I would love to add this tape to my collection, but I can't find it anywhere, and its not in stock here, so I'm sad I can't get it. My favorite State member is Tom Lennon. I was gonna marry him when I moved to New York, but I never moved to New York, and obviously never married Tom. I get a big ol smile on my face when I see him on the Snickers commercials, and I smile when I see Michael Ian Black on ""ED"". They need to have a reunion, or even bring back ""Viva Variety"" so I can see them again. Ya'll should rent ""Hot Wet American Summer"" to see Mike, Showalter, Dave, Ken and Joe.

Their outrageous parodies and other skits are better than any to come before or after them.  If I couldn't be home to watch it, I would tape it.  I really regret not recording some of my favorite sketches now.  If your a fan of the State you're gonna love this.  Although I really wish they would have included the skit with the guy who sets his toothbrush free and it later comes back to him with a wife a kiddy toothbrushes.  It's kind of depressing in the sense that I got a refreshing reminder of the genius we're all missing out on though.  I really miss that show.",1020038400,,670,4.147286821705427

While the cast was in their mid 20s & fans in their teens, I was in my early 30s when it originally aired (early 1990s)and hence SMART ENOUGH to tape almost each and every episode. OF COURSE I bought this tape as soon as I heard it was available. Now, my kids, who were babies at the time, LOVE it too.
If you love goofy, yet very clever comedy and were born anytime after 1965, you won't regret buying this tape. It's true comedic genious and hopefully MTV will release all four seasons or at least sell them to Comedy Central so the rest of the world can enjoy the few precious skits that were recorded.
