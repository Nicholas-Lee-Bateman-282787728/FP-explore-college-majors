3856644,4,B0026QDNC8,"I like this movie.  It is based on true events and appears to not stray too far from the facts, even though there is some fictionalization and well used war movie themes are evident.  Still, the actions of the German surface raiders, especially armed merchantman like the Atlantis, are little known and ""Under Ten Flags"" does a good job of letting us see how they operated. Some viewers might wonder about the portrayal of the German captain as almost anti-Nazi and his efforts to wage a clean war with as few casualties as possible, but apparently that was indeed what happened.  The movie moves at a good pace with sufficient action to keep the tension going.  There are some anachronisms, like the too modern reconnaissance airplane, and movie making compromises, like a destroyer portraying a cruiser, but they do not really detract from the enjoyment of the film.

Unfortunately, this DVD does not present the movie particularly well.  It is a pan and scan 4:3 version of a wide screen movie.  The image is washed out and not very sharp.  The audio is okay but only two channel.  So, this is far from even the average standards of what DVD can deliver.  But, even with its deficiencies, it is the only DVD of this movie available.  Hopefully, a DVD that does not have these faults will someday be available.  Until then, the movie is worth watching even on this DVD.",1264982400,14,1371,4.666666666666667

To know that this movie is based on actual facts is amazing. ""Under 10 Flags"" is a rare gem that cuts through the mountains of anti German propaganda and for once shows a side of Nazi Germany that is seldom if ever made into a movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who seeks the truth of Germany under the Nazi regime. What is truly amazing is that this movie was produced just a few years after World war 2 when anti German propaganda was defining that war and led to the whole scale condemnation of a nation for so long.",1467158400,,692,4.242424242424242

3856754,4,B0026QDNC8,"Not an Academy Award winner, but an interesting insight into the early German war at sea. The captain's chivalrous outlook overpowered the Nazi outlook of his crewmembers especially when they found that they had captured some Jews from a foreign ship.

3856756,5,B0026QDNC8,"I haven't seen this film since my Mother took me to see it at the old Dominion theater in 1960, but I have remembered quite a bit of it. It was a good film in 1960, and it still is today.  The true story of the KM Atlantis' 665 day cruise is remarkable no matter which side of the war one was on, and Captain Rogge seems to be universally respected because of his humane treatment of prisoners and the almost chivalrous way he conducted his war.  Both these points are nicely brought out in the film.  As for the DVD itself, it isn't letterboxed and the picture is a little washed out,  but this is the only way the film can be owned and it IS perfectly watchable.  Some reviews have complained about the language options, in particular not having an English language track.  The disc plays perfectly in my Samsung multi-region player, and if you select the English soundtrack you get the soundtrack I heard back in 1960 (Charles Laughton is distinctive anywhere!).  For a look at a very interesting piece of history, give this a try.  It isn't perfect, but in my opinion it's perfectly acceptable.  And don't forget, if you do want to order the film, it is a region 2 disc.",1428105600,,1174,4.398148148148148

A German merchant ship is disguised to look like various other ships and when their prey (other merchant ships) get close enough, the Germans fire a shot across their bow and order them to abandon ship.  The Germans take them prisoner and keep them in a cargo hold.  The German captain, is a decent sort and tries to treat everyone decent but his first officer is a real mean man who wants to treat the prisoners harshly.  The British are working on breaking the German code so they can find this rouge ship.  Good B&W WWII action flick that was based upon a true events.",1428105600,,594,4.462962962962963

3856769,5,B0026QDNC8,"Here's the true story of this brave, courageous German raider: during WWII the Japanese emperor gave Japan's highest award to three foreigners, only: Hitler, Goering( for help designing airplanes, Zero fighter), and the captain of this pirate ship. Why the captain??? Here's what happened: in September 1941 the pirate ship sank a lowly British freighter in the Indian Ocean. It was enroute from England to Singapore, and its British captain carried in his duffle bag a handwritten letter from Winnie the Pooh Churchill to the commander at Singapore. The letter stated simply a warning to the commander: Britain had no means of ""reinforcing"" Singapore other than the 50,000+ thousand troupes already stationed there plus two big ships, Repulse, Prince of Wales. Churchill advised the commander to engage in mock maneuvers designed to cause the Japs to believe he had more troops that what he actually had.
So what happened: the pirate ship fired salvos across the bow of the freighter and using admiralty law ordered its crew to evacuate before sinking. The crew evacuated; but this resourceful German captain decided to board the ship, take its food, oil, etc. before sinking. This was the custom. While looting before sinking, the captain visited the freighter's captain's quarters and noticed the duffel bag full of mail. He took it back to his pirate ship.
After sinking the freigter the captain scoured the duffel bag mail and noticed Churchill's handwritten envelope to the Singapore commander. He recognized it must be important, got he envelope back to Berlin where in October, 1941 it was delivered to the Japanese ambassador in Berlin, who quickly got its contents back to Tokyo.
So why important? In Tokyo at that time, Oktober, 1941, the Jap generals and admiralty were deciding whether to attack Siberia, or go south and take the East Indies, Hong Kong, and Singapore. This latter required a sneak attack at Pearl Harbor. After evaluating the relative ease of capturing Singapore the Jap military----because of the letter---decided upon the southern strategy and attacked Pearl Harbor and Singapore.
That's what happened. I have not seen the movie, yet; but as 50% german I continue to admire the pirate ship's captain---he had good German resourcefulness, and got a personal award from the Emperor for it! Amen.",1381708800,2,2325,5.1534391534391535
3856770,4,B0026QDNC8,"Although I have never been a Van Heflin fan (although he was perfect for his role in Shane),  he works in his historical role. It is not a Nazi apology movie, the fact is that the captain of the raider Atlantis was cut from a different cloth in that he pushed the envelope against his Nazi bosses to fight in a manner of a gentlemen.  Perhaps he was an outdated warrior, but he is one of the few German officers who actually earned their place in history as a gallant, honorable,  and quite effective foe who earned the respect of the Royal Navy.  The depiction of the Atlantis and her rather remarkable commerce raider cruise is far more accurate than most films. The only black mark of the film is a quite unnecessary T & A scenes when a  hot blond of the late 1950's who would look more in place in a 60's beach movie  is somehow showing her stuff (as much as she is allowed) in a 1941 time period.  It's a mild distraction to the story but not too bad.",1377129600,6,956,4.191256830601093

3856772,4,B0026QDNC8,"Van Heflin plays the captain of a German surface raider in this 1960 production of real life events that took place during WWII in 1940-1941.  The German captain (Heflin) is portrayed as a decent man who is doing his duty during a time of war.  He would, whenever possible, allow ships he attacked to stop and offload all passengers and crew before being sunk.  His overzealous first officer on the other hand does not see the value in wasting time energy and resources to do this, and put the ship at increased risk of detection.  Heflin nevertheless less proceeds by taking a minimum of life whenever possible.

This particular ship flies under the flags of many nations as it stalks its prey.  Then when it is too late for the other ship to escape the German ensign is hoisted above what appears to be , hidden guns are exposed, and open fire.  The German ship jams the other ship's radio signals and destroys the radio mast.  Once this is done the Germans send a follow-up message stating that all is well, thus confusing the British Royal Navy which is trying its best to figure out what is sinking all of this shipping.  It is a submarine or a surface raider?

Charles Laughton plays Adm. Russell of the Royal Navy, and it is responsibility to figure out what is going on.  This film was made toward the very end of his career and, to me at least, he had lost some of his panache.  Plus, to me Laughton will always be either Capt. Blight or Capt. Kidd...and seeing him in WWII Royal Navy uniform should not have been a surprised, but frankly I think he makes a better sailing ship captain than a desk admiral.

All in all I was extremely impressed by the storyline...one I've heard of for years but only recently had a chance to watch.

4 Solid stars!  I enjoyed it through and through.",1321833600,5,1792,4.45398773006135
3856773,4,B0026QDNC8,"This movie presents a less well known phase of the Second World War at sea -- German Navy commerce raiders preying on Allied merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic in 1940 and 1941.  The screenplay drew on the 602-day cruise of the German raider ""Atlantis"" and the Royal Navy's efforts to find, track, and destroy the vessel.  For more details, see Wikipedia's article on ""German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis."")

Van Helflin played the German captain, modeled after Captain Bernhard Rogge, who tried to spare the lives of merchant crews and passengers as he sank the vessels.  Charles Laughton played the British admiral, though his portrayal edged toward a parody of his other roles.  Wartime film clips spliced into the movie have some anachronisms, and some other cutaways will distract aircraft and ship buffs.  The issues in morality and international law are treated, but lightly.  Still, this is a good film to introduce the naval war in a distant theatre.

8353409,4,B0026QDNC8,"I liked the film. Van Heflin plays a different role. I'm familiar with the saga of the WWII German raider ""Atlantis""; there are several books about this armed auxiliary cruiser disguised as a typical commercial merchant ship of the era - however, it is a sea wolf in sheep's clothing! The film credits list one of the ship's officers as an advisor to the film production. If you are familiar with the Confederate raider ""Alabama"" during the American Civil War then this is a similar story almost four score years later. A good 'sea story'.",1488153600,,539,4.684210526315789
8353410,3,B0026QDNC8,"UNDER TEN FLAGS
I would go to the ends of the earth to see a movie Charles Laughton is in.  I would go to the ends of the earth to see a movie starring Van Heflin, the latter a slightly less skilled actor.  Both capture and lock in my attention when they are on the screen.  Now I had a film with both actors together.  What more could I ask?
UNDER TEN FLAGS is a true story about the tracking and destroying of a Nazi freighter that conceals itself as a peaceful vessel and then when it gets close enough, removes the disguise and fires on and sinks the targeted boat.  In this case, though, the captain of the rogue ship, Van Heflin, orders that the victimized ship be sunk but that no one on board should die, everyone being taken aboard his ship as prisoner. This is hardly what Hitler had in mind but then this captain is not a Nazi, just a practioner, clinging to his humanity while doing his job.).  He even cares for a dog on board, like Hitler with his dog and all Aryan children, but as affirmation of his humanity not as oxymoron.  The Nazi helping him is his aide, played by John Erickson, an actor who at one time was considered a new Brando.
Charles Laughton, is the stern British naval leader trying to catch Heflin, maintaining a stern professional efficiency in the atmosphere he must commandgiant map and all.  Cecil Parker is the boss over him.  Alec Nicol (another strong controlled performance) is the expert Texan spy who pulls off an almost miraculous theft of the critical German naval code, a robbery which leads to the end of the reign of Heflins freighter.
Though this was war, war seemed to be happening someplace else far away.  To me, the high point of drama of the film was the magnificent speech given by Liam Redmond as the dying captain of the victimized British ship.  Though there is no scene in the film when Laughton and Heflin meet face to face, there was a clear sense of a tussle between them, as if they were playing internet chess.
I have to give the film to Heflins more controlled performance.  Laughton was too Laughtony, with his tics, changes in direction, double takes.  I kept saying to myself, Where is the director?  Tone him down!  Still, Ill take thisover no Laughton at all.  Heflins character wound up as NATO commander after the war. I assume his character and Laughtons met for tea at some time.  I wonder what was said.",1472342400,2,2378,4.442396313364055
