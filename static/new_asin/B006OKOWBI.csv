8501959,5,B006OKOWBI,"I've been a fan of this show for numerous years, sadly it went off the air when I was 3 years old in 1984. With Richie (Ron Howard) & The Fonz (Henry Winkler) shared a close friendship from 1976 to when Richie & Lori Beth moved to Los Angeles when Richie became a movie director in 1980, Richie considered The Fonz as a brother to him since The Fonz helped Richie out when Richie was in the Army & couldn't be there when Little Richie was born, so The Fonz was there to coach & support Lori Beth before Little Richie was born & Richie was so thankful that The Fonz was there @ the right time. With Richie & The Fonz & Ralph Malph (Don Most) & Potsie Weber (Anson Williams) were good friends during Richie's high school years & all through college & army training & remained friends when Richie married Lori Beth. So, if you or anyone you know is a die hard Happy Days fan, get this DVD, it talks about family life & friendships that will last forever.",1503446400,,951,4.202185792349726
