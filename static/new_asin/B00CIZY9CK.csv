8582296,1,B00CIZY9CK,What a snooze fest video!  No narration and nothing more than slow (and I mean VERY slow) moving videos and the island's scenery and not much at that.  A total waste of money.,1511827200,,175,4.2727272727272725
8582297,5,B00CIZY9CK,"This video nicely captures the beauty of the Kwajalein Atoll.

It will likely be of interest primarily to persons who have lived at or have visited the atoll.  Having lived there for over 11 years this video is a welcome addition to our video library.",1394409600,,251,4.555555555555555

Unbelievable views of the most beautiful water I've ever seen. Would be amazing to actually live there and experience day to day... If you can, pour yourself a cocktail & watch this from your hammock, then relax in paradise. Next best thing to being there!",1379894400,,258,4.630434782608695
