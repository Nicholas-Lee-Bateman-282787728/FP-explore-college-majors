8648802,5,B00J8WW15I,This is a great video for those who want to get more information about how to train your border collie. The video is a great continuation from the previous Frae The Cradle. We get to see how different dogs require different methods of training. The video shows us the amount of trust we must have in our dog to let the instinct grow and develop. The scenery is also a sight to behold!,1401753600,,384,4.273972602739726

8648804,5,B00J8WW15I,"Presents a philosophy of working with sheeodogs that allows the centuries of stock sense bred into Border collies to develop naturally.  The viewer who chooses to  follow pups Megg, Queenie, Kemp and Quest (and brother Glen now herding in Switzerland), will see individual traits in each pup that require different approaches within an over-reaching training method.  The breathtaking scenery of the Border country is backdrop to the pups' progression from four months to about a year old.  A refreshing journey that emphasizes patience, quiet handling of dog by shepherdess and sheep by dog.  This journey is possible because the dogs' breeder and trainer, Viv Billingham Parkes, TRUSTS that their innate ability to read and control sheep will emerge through experience and kind coaching.  We see skill develop from a fun compulsion on the pups' part to quiet control of the sheep.  ""In Dog We Trust"" is an apt title: trusting the dogs' breeding and inbred abilities is critical to the success of Ms. Billingham Parkes' method.  I look forward to the next and final DVD of this trilogy, which I believe will chronicle the road to sheepdog trials and practical work.",1399075200,2,1166,5.0680628272251305
8648805,5,B00J8WW15I,"First of all I would like to speak out my biggest congratulations on putting this film into such an outstanding documentary. The filming and acting is of excellent quality & very professional. Of course the music fits perfectly as usual! Super super work, you can be proud of you!!
The scenery, colours & the sharpness of the landscape, that is being reflected, is simply unique. The voice-overs are brilliant, a great mixture of objective information and emotional funny statements that made me giggle. To see Faes run at the Springhill Trial accompanied with narration was fantastic! Showing the young shepherd boy shearing sheep the traditional way is wonderful.
Thank you so much for these educational 83 minutes and it's gonna be a big challenge to do these whistles properly (I use my fingers)!! Thank you for helping and leading me day in and day out. It's all about FREEDOM!
Each pup is one-of-a-kind, absolutely magnificent!! I like the slow motion of Kemp very much, tremendous dogs!
PS: I love the scene of you, Viv, sitting on the ground waving and the pups wagging their tails xxx",1398211200,3,1093,4.881720430107527
