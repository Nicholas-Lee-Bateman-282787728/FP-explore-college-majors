8284277,5,B001BQW488,"I will start with a disclosure: I'm the film's publicity director. That said, that also means I've viewed the film at least two dozen times, and watched it grow from scattered 4-5 minute clips pulled from over 300 hours of footage into 80 minutes of good, wholesome entertainment. The film has a positive message for kids of all ages and backgrounds, and Mr. Watson and his staff are true everyday heroes to the DC community. I hope you enjoy it!
