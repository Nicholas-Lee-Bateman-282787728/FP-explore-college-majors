6759233,1,B00OQRUAO4,"This movie tries to adopt a new style and totally fails. People like scooby doo for what it is. If it ain't broke don't fix it, but this movie tries to do just that. The creators tried to change a perfectly grove that scooby doo had going on. I am ok with changes that are improvements, but not changes that are downgrades. This movie lacks the heart of a good scooby doo movie,a trend that was started in the 70's and was continued in what's new scooby doo and the earlier movies that were IMPROVEMENTS. This movie is a DOWNGRADE. Don't waste your money on this new styled scooby doo movie that totally sucks.",1465603200,,610,4.359649122807017

6759252,3,B00OQRUAO4,"Released in 2015, SCOOBY-DOO! MOON MONSTER MADNESS is twenty-third in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.

In MADNESS, the gang wins a lottery for a trip on the Sly Star One, a space craft designed to take tourists into space. Unfortunately, things begin to go awry even before the gang board the ship: Sly Baron (voiced by Malcom McDowell), owner of the spacecraft, is incredibly obnoxious, and Shannon, the pilot, drives a wedge between Daphne and Velma.

Relationships between the gang deteriorate once they are aboard ship and begin to mix and mingle with the VIP guests, who include two experienced astronauts (one voiced by Mark Hamill), a football player, an alien hunter, and a celebrity reporterbut everything gets wildly out of hand when an alien lifeform damages the ship and forces it to make an emergency landing at Sly Barons secret resort on the dark side of the moon. Can the gang pull themselves back together, catch the alien, and get back to earth? Well, this is a Scooby-Doo cartoon, after all!

MADNESS references the sci-fi classic ALIEN with sideswipes at INVADERS FROM MARS and MARS ATTACKS! and several others. Very often such references enliven Scooby-Doo movies, but in this case not so much. Strange to say, the art design, which is deliberately sterile, seems to put a damper on the whole thing, and a fairly large chunk of the shows run time is wasted in a what if scene, with each member of the gang imagining what they would do if aliens invaded earth. It feels an awful lot like the writers ran out of ideas.

I like to point out that, while no one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons of being great art, they are usually well done and entertaining. It is always fun to revisit the gang, the plots make fun of their own clichs, and the animation here is usually pretty sharp. All of that is true of SCOOBY-DOO! MOON MONSTER MADNESSbut it feels preachy and somehow or another it doesnt really click. Recommended for fans.

6759268,1,B00OQRUAO4,"My kids and I love Scooby Doo but this is a terrible movie. Whomever wrote this script must really hate the characters. Fred is an idiot, Shaggy and Scooby are idiots, Daphne is petty, shallow and an idiot and Velma is petty and secretly wants to be pretty and cool. Really? Did the screenwriter ever watch a Scooby Doo before? The secondary characters are often annoyed by how annoying Scooby and the gang are. This movie is badly written but I can't place all the blame on the writer. Could the director or producer not have stepped in and put a stop to this mess? The movie also makes all kinds of weird choices, like having the characters keep their space helmets on for half the movie, even though they are inside the spaceship (so they are hard to recognize and understand).Also, the director/writer seems to think that long awkward pauses between characters is very funny, because they use that technique about 6 or 7 times in this movie (and it's never funny once). The animation is first rate - other than that this is a terrible movie. I hope the studio goes with a different team for the next Scooby Doo movie - these guys have no idea what they are doing.",1454457600,,1167,4.483568075117371

6759295,1,B00OQRUAO4,"Growing up with Scooby and the gang, I love scooby-doo to this day, but unfortunately the new movies keep getting worse. They are dragging that once very cool show into a horrible clich&eacute; with a sexist touch. Remember the original? Velma would have NEVER been mad at Daphne for having a higher test score. She's become an awkward nerd. Fred? They have turned him into a weightlifting idiot. Not to mention Shaggy & Scooby, they are characterized as the two stupidest creatures alive. And Daphne? Well, if they colored her hair blonde, she could fit right in the ""dumb blonde"" section just perfectly. That is NOT what Scooby-doo is about!
The storyline itself was okay, I did like the little twist at the end, but besides that it was the worst Scooby-doo movie ever! I didn't even bother to buy it, even though I own basically every movie and show up until that ""Mystery Inc"" show started (just too weird).

Bottom line: Bring back the old values and stop turning Scooby-doo into a horrible clich&eacute;!",1431907200,5,1010,4.771428571428571

I  known may chuckle about it but just can't this addiction. Can surely recommend both movie and seller !!,1430697600,,395,4.324324324324325
6759300,2,B00OQRUAO4,I would say this scooby do mystery and the last one have not been up to the same level as previous mystery movies. This makes Fred look like idiot.

6759310,5,B00OQRUAO4,"Like most of the reviewers here, I live in a house of Scooby fanatics and eagerly await every new Scooby movie or show. From a purely Scooby/Mystery Inc. perspective, this movie was the best of the recent outings since Stage Fright. It certainly has its flaws. The reviewers who mentioned the Daphne/Velma tension as being a bit much were right on the money and Im also disappointed in the lack of Fred/Daphne interaction. I also am not a huge fan of the trend in the recent movies to make Fred stupid. That being said, I still think it is a solid Scooby offering with Scooby & Shaggy really being the best part for most of my family.

Where I found the strength of the movie to be was with the continuous winks to Sci-fi movies and games. As a fan of that genre, I got a good laugh out of the fact that the older astronauts were clearly meant to be the Tommy Lee Jones and Clint Eastwood characters from Space Cowboys, that the alien looked like the ones from the Alien movies, the robots name was Hal, etc. But, the real kicker was veteran voice actress Jennifer Hale (who has been in most of the Scooby movies since The Witchs Ghost), known to a lot of gamers as the voice of the female version of Shepard in the Mass Effect games, in full on Shepard voice being paranoid about first contact and take some none too subtle pokes at the Mass Effect story.

I hope the next Scooby installment really focuses on the gang without the interpersonal drama, but Im happy watching this with the kids in the meantime.",1428883200,3,1510,4.389285714285714

6759341,2,B00OQRUAO4,to be honest I was a bit disappointed by there not being any Fred and Daphne moments. and like one reviewer the Daphne and Velma being mad was a bit much. I agree on a lot on what the first reviewer said. but hey there will always be one bad apple. The rest of the films I enjoyed. Some had corny endings but I'm not complaining.,1424390400,7,329,4.0
