8486741,3,B0002DVA3G,I find the earlier volumes (A-G) much better than the later ones. I've listened to all of them on line and they got much 'jazzier' after 'G'.  The older part of our congregation would not enjoy them.  They love many of the songs on the earlier ones.,1378598400,3,249,4.276595744680851
