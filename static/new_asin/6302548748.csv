480806,4,6302548748,"What could possibly out do the sheer drama of the greatest crisis this country ever faced?  Gettysburg is an excellent film, magnificent in scope, filled with truly great performances (did you ever see Jeff Daniels any  better than this?).  Just a few flaws: the battles scenes were quite good,  but I've seen better, and the film occasionally takes its own historical  importance too seriously.  Still, a good film, and I can't complain too  much, I own a copy.  Look fast during Picket's Charge to see Ted Turner as  a Condeferate and Ken Burns as a Yankee.",912556800,,559,4.739583333333333

480961,5,6302548748,"Wow. This movie is an incredibly well-written, well-directed and well-acted film. I have read numerous historical books re the Battle of Gettysburg, and it's amazing how accurately this lengthy screenplay was written without becoming tedious for even a moment. It managed to be both highly reflective as it examined the anguish and courage of key moments and characters, while also providing relentless battle scenes that accurately reflected the tenacity of the soldiers in this war. There's a lot to consider including in such a movie about such a pivotal event in the Civil War, but they have managed to provide a very comprehensive glimpse, capturing the essence of each main character wonderfully.",1519084800,,702,5.276785714285714

480976,4,6302548748,"This is a beautiful movie. Elegiac, like ""Black Hawk Down.""  Anyone who has seen ""Gettysburg"" or the other knows what I mean. The soundtrack is haunting and majestic. I don't particularly care for Martin Sheen as General Lee but that is my only quibble with the casting. There is a scene where Confederate soldiers are marching down a road and some of them are barefoot. It reminded me of the scene in ""Gone With the Wind"" where Ashley, home on leave, tells Scarlett ""My men are barefoot now!"" A history lesson, but what a lesson!",1516320000,,530,4.578947368421052

481031,4,6302548748,"This was just about as good as Gods and Generals, with one exception, and that was a weak portrayal of Robert E. Lee by Martin Sheen. I wish they had stayed with Robert Duvall as Lee in this film. General Lee is portrayed as an indecisive, dithering old man, while the historical record says otherwise. Also I was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia and have never heard a more ridiculous attempt at a southern accent as the one put forth by Sheen.

On the other hand, Jeff Daniels performance as Colonel Chamberlain makes up for all of that. This film is well worth your time to watch. I only docked it one star because Sheen as Lee got on my nerves. If you are not from the south and raised on General Lee's exploits, don't take this performance as representative of history.",1510876800,,779,4.4475524475524475

481058,5,6302548748,"Hey sports fans.  A classic indeed, a definite favorite of mine.  So glad to have this version on Blu-ray.  Not a short film by any means, and with the director's cut, I believe there is an additional 20min.  Over four hours long, so have a really big bag of popcorn ready.  In my opinion, some of the best drama, some really great dialogue too.  An interesting take on what life was like on both sides.  So many extras to make the reenactment battles look real.  Movie is based on the book by Michael Shaara: The Killer Angels.  Very much recommended, a great film indeed.  Have a great day.",1509580800,2,592,4.398148148148148

481063,5,6302548748,I live within driving distance of Gettysburg and having watched this movie before visiting the battlefield gave me a much deeper understanding of what happened there.  Very long movie worth every minute of it though.  The scenes from Little Round Top are especially moving.,1508716800,,273,5.181818181818182
481078,5,6302548748,"BEWARE: If you order the ""multi-format"" edition, you'll get the Blu-ray only version. This is not the Blu-ray plus DVD with extras.

That being said, this movie is an American classic. Excited to see it in HD!",1508198400,,209,4.648648648648648
481079,4,6302548748,"As a movie, it is magnificent, as history, it leaves quite a bit to be desired; Gettysburg was not just Lee's greatest defeat, it is a defeat that may be laid squarely on Lee himself. Time, distance, a lack of partisanship on the part of historians that are not married to either the Myth of the Lost Cause or the Myth of Robert E. Lee show a different picture than what is too often shown. Lee believed he could allow his commanders a level of discretion that worked when those commanders were Longstreet and Jackson. With Jacksons firm hand lost in the Pyrrhic victory at Chancellorsville, Lee was forced to reorganize his army. He is cited by Shelby Foote as understanding that he would have to do more, that he would need to be in firmer control. Saying so however does not make it so. He failed to give clear written orders, everything was oral. He failed to make clear to Ewell on day one that taking the heights was critical and instead told him to take the heights if practicable. He failed to tell Stuart exactly what was expected of him. He failed to use the cavalry at hand when Stuart failed to keep him informed. He failed to be available on day two to take control of the right flank of his army when that flank failed in its objective of turning the Union left. He failed to listen to Longstreet and fight on the tactical defensive. He failed to keep his troops in shoes, and he failed to get across to Hill and Heth that shoes were less important than not engaging an enemy he was not yet prepared to engage and so, for want of a shoe a battle was lost.",1507680000,,1569,4.322033898305085

481081,5,6302548748,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. An epic and moving, if not historically accurate, portrayal of the greatest battle ever fought on American soil.

481086,5,6302548748,"Excellent movie. One that can be watched over and over. Faster paced and more exciting than Gods and Generals.

One thing I like about these movies, and the books they were taken from, is that they provide a  perspective that is both fair and open-minded.

Apparently it did not do well so the final movie of the end of the Civil war was not made.  Regardless this is a good historically accurate (as far as I can tell) telling of the story using real Civil War re-enactors.  The music is haunting as well.

481127,4,6302548748,"I really appreciated this movie, especially as my great great grandfather, George W. Finley, was in Pickett's Charge and lived to tell the terrible tale. This film gives a fair view of both sides. Some of the actors knocked it out of the park. The late Richard Jordan as General Armistead was incredibly moving, especially knowing that he died only months after making this film and how much it meant to him to do this role. Jeff Daniels did a fabulous job as Colonel Chamberlain, and there were other stellar performances. I wasn't as wild about Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee, which is why I gave it a four instead of a five. He did an okay job but appeared out of it at times. The music for this movie is amazing. It gets a high five. I especially loved the footage at the end of the reunions at Gettysburg with the veterans who must have been in their 90's by then by the looks of them. They made peace with each other. Very moving. My great great grandfather attended these reunions but died before this footage was shot.",1504569600,2,1025,4.4

481160,4,6302548748,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.  In terms of historical accuracy, so far as it went, it was quite good. Particularly in terms of uniforms, and of course being shot on location. The battle scenes were also quite good for the day.  However, the synthetic orchestra detracts from the movie significantly - with the score itself at times being truly awful.  It sets an odd mood much of the time, with those moods frequently having absolutely no correlation to what is happening on screen...and even getting in the way.  And there are times when dialogue alone would have been far better, plus a few scenes where the dialogue itself consisted of improbably schmaltzy non-sequiter conversations unlikely to occur between commanders that would have been engaged trying to figure out what to do in the morning.  The movie makes it seem as though Gettysburg revolved around the opening battle at the Seminary, at Little Round Top, and at Picket's charge....with nothing else being of any importance. There is 2 seconds of footage from devil's den.  Why in a movie so incredibly long could they not at least squeeze in 10 minutes to cover what Jeb Stuart had foolishly done and been so proud of, the railroad cut, the Union flight through downtown, Ewell's dithering and failure to follow up?  The Union hiding behind tombstones and desperately trying to erect fortifications in time on Culp's Hill, and the eventual unsuccessful attack there?  Sickles' advance into the wheat field that almost turned into disaster, the butchery at close range in the Peach orchard and along Plum Run, Custer's charge that stymied Jeb Stuart attacking the Union line from the rear during Picket's charge?  Not only that, but the script makes it seem as though the entire battle strategy was set by Lee - with the Federals just sitting there along one line the whole time waiting to be attacked.  Some of the dialogue was fine; however, there were a few sequences of dialogue that were painfully bad screenwriting.  With good editing, inclusion of more key elements of the story, a decent score and real orchestra, and a plot in which both sides were active participants instrategy reacting to one another, this could have been a truly powerful film.  But you get the sense that after hiring just a couple of decent actors, they were already 25% over budget and had to cut corners on screen writing, editing, score, and orchestra.  But hats off to the reenactors, who did an incredible job.  Despite all the criticism, I would give this 3.5 stars and point out that I watched all 4+ hours straight through....as this true and important American story is so riveting, and the historical accuracy of what portions of the battle shown so good, that it is very worth watching despite its many faults.",1503878400,,2777,4.8559322033898304

Overall the film is a disappointment, especially for viewers with more than a passing interest in the battle and/or the entire US Civil War. There's a lot to be said for the cinematography and the fact it was filmed on location, unfortunately the producers went astray trying to cram in memorable historic exchanges that actually took place during different battles. Naturally, they wanted to appeal to as many viewers as possible, however by doing so they made the film historically inaccurate and irritating to informed viewers. Rather than trying to tell the story of the three horrific days at Gettysburg, they should have focused in and stayed with one pertinent aspect, such as Longstreet's disagreement with Lee - that in itself would provide more than enough drama and storyline. As a long time student of this war I can think of dozens of fascinating storylines ideal for film and it's truly a shame more films aren't made about the war that defined the United States unlike any other conflict.",1494547200,,1129,4.824742268041237

Martin Sheen, a fine actor, was horribly miscast as Robert E. Lee. The general was six feet tall and always stood erect. Sheen is short and stooped, presenting a figure lacking any command on the screen in this role.

481349,3,6302548748,"Gettysburg, 1993 film

In June 1863 General Robert E. Lee moved the Confederate Army into the North in an effort to destroy the Union Army. A Confederate scout reported the movement of the Union Army, which was closer than reported. General George Meade now commanded the Union Army. Colonel Chamberlain of the 20th Maine has 120 soldiers who are troubled. He speaks to them about the right thing to do. The Union Cavalry sees the Confederate Infantry marching alone. General Lee considers their situation. It is the first day of battle, July 3, 1863. The Yankees repel the Rebel attack. Eight miles to the west the Confederate Army marches into Cashtown; many need shoes. General Lee orders an attack. A sniper shoots a Union officer. Union troops move up as quickly as possible. The Confederate attack sends Union troops in retreat. General Lee plans to attack the Union troops in Gettysburg. The Confederates explain The Cause, its for States Rights.

The Union prepares for the next days battle. A British military observer comments on America. General Lee hopes this will be the final battle so the war doesnt go on and on. Union troops occupy Little Round Top and must defend it to the last. They shoot at the advancing Rebels and repel them. There is another attack, and another, but the Union line holds. When the Union is low on powder they fix bayonets and charge. A General sends a scout to learn about the Federal position. The Federals hold the heights and were reinforced. There is talk to pad out the story and provide background details. General Lee meets General J. E. B. Stuart with complaints about his performance and failure to scout the enemy. General Lee plans an attack, retreat is not an option. General Picketts Virginians are available. Colonel Chamberlains Maine troops are moved to the center - the safest place.

General Lee will send 15,000 troops to attack the Federal center. This attack will decide the fate of the country. Confederate guns will fire at the center until they run out of powder, then their troops will charge across an open field. Can they succeed? The cannons announce the start of the battle. The Confederate battalions form up to march to attack. Union cannon begins firing, their troops wait behind fortifications until the enemy nears. There is some hand-to-hand combat. The Union is victorious. The Confederate Army retreats back to Virginia. Gettysburg was the biggest and bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil, the combined losses exceeded 53,000. [Later General James Longstreet wrote a paper on the futility of sending infantry to attack entrenched artillery. This mistake was repeated in WW I with greater casualties.]

This movie is less than great because of the padding. It would have helped to begin with an explanation and a big picture of this battle. One item was missing. General J. E. B. Stuart and his Invincibles were sent to attack and capture the Union baggage train, to capture what they could carry and destroy the rest. This would have forced the Union Army to retreat for fresh supplies. General George A. Custer and the Michigan Seventh Cavalry stopped them. Custer won every battle he was in except for his last one in 1876.

The Making of Gettysburg is a commentary about this production. You should watch this first for an overall view of the battle and story. Civil War re-enactors took part, all volunteers. More Americans died in the Civil War than in all other wars combined. I don't know if it was intended, but General Lee made a fatal mistake by fighting the Battle of Gettysburg instead repositioning his troops (but Im not a General). Somebody once said the best general will win by positioning his troops so the enemy has to retreat.",1493078400,,3733,4.863207547169812

481382,5,6302548748,"The Battle that took place between July 1st and July 3rd 1863 remains the bloodiest battle ever fought on American
soil...a battle that should surely have brought an end the the Civil-War, however it continued for almost two further
bloody years.
In June 1963 'General Robert E Lee' (Martin Sheen) leads a large force northwards with the intent of, after a series of
military successes to invade in the hope of breaking the Unions resolve....what he was unaware of was that a large
Union force was moving  in their direction...they were indeed on collision course close by the little known town of
Gettysburg.
'General John Buford' (Sam Elliott) and his command try to slow down the Confederate forces moving toward the main
force.
The Confederate army take position, but fail to occupy the high-ground as one officer had been designated to do which
allows the Union army the chance to do just that, thus protecting their rear when mounting their defences.
'Colonel Joshua Chamberlain' (Jeff Daniels) and his command are given the task of being the flank on Little Round Top,
in effect the last line of defence should 'Colonel Strong's' unit be forced to retreat.
The battle for the high-ground a significant sequence during the build-up to the battle yet to come....with the confederate
force advancing in numbers and ammunition running out, 'Colonel Chamberlain' orders a bayonet charge, a brave action
that would thwart the confederate effort to take the high-ground they could and should perhaps have already occupied.
On the final day, 'General Robert E Lee' has decided to send three divisions to attack the Unions  centre at Cemetery Ridge
believing that a successful assault would break the Union-Army's resolve....'General Pickett' division flanked by divisions
led by 'Major General Trimble's' and 'General Pettigrew' would lead the assault.
The ground that lay before them...around one-mile to cross, open, coupled with fences as obstacles, facing a continuous
onslaught of artillery and gun-fire.....'Lieutenant General James Longstreet' (Tom Berenger) tells 'General Lee' that he believes
the plan is doomed to fail and many will be lost, however 'General Lee' believes that his plan will be a desisive move.
The artillery is ordered to use all it's fire-power to soften-up the Union positions despite the fact that there will be nothing
left to offer support during the assault.
The divisions set out to attack the Union centre...in truth they were in the main little more than 'canon-fodder'
The losses were catastrophic, especially on the Confederate side, though the losses and injuries among the Union force
was also high.
The battle should surely have brought an end to the conflict..but didn't.
The Union forces after Gettysburg scored many more victories on the field of conflict than the Confederates, the latter never
really recovering from this heavy defeat.
The film attempts to tell both sides leading up to and during the 3 day battle, focusing on several of the main figures, though
in more depth with 'Colonel Joshua Chamberlain' on the Union side and 'Lieutenant General Longstreet' on the Confederate
side.
The battle sequences are lengthy and graphic, in the main well presented......
Certainly a film for those that have interest in American History to watch.
What a shame the third film in the series 'Last Full Measure' is unlikely to be screened.
Thoughts -
This well re-enacted portrayal of the events at Gettysburg highlighted numerous errors of judgement by the celebrated
and often successful in battle Confederate General - Robert E Lee, despite apparent advice he chose to over-ride.
(I myself am no military-man, however i am always puzzled, as is the case during this battle, why a General would send
thousands of troops across open-ground and in the face of a sustained barrage of fire to almost certain death, trouble is
the tactic continued to be used in many a war since.....some lessons are never learned i guess)",1492732800,,3962,5.14108527131783

481389,5,6302548748,"I have owned and watched FOUR different video versions of Gettysburg.

The first was the 12-inch laserdisc version that was surprisingly well made. It was the theater-length release, at 254 minutes, and for me, a Civil War buff, watching it was almost like a religious experience. (I had a similar epiphany when I watched the Ken Burns Civil War documentary some time before, now available as a DVD.)

The second was the directors cut boxed-set laserdisc, that came with a nice book about the movie and about the battle itself. This second version, 17 minutes longer than the previous release, extended some scenes and added a few new ones, at least one of which added some dramatic depth to the movie. While I believe that the early disc was audio encoded in basic Dolby Surround (I am stretching my memory here), the second was done in DTS, which is also how the original was presented in movie theaters.

The problem with this 271-minute boxed set was that the video and audio (the DTS audio technology notwithstanding) were both inferior to that of the earlier disc. The video was excessively dark and off color in some scenes and, worse, the audio lost much of its impact, particularly the sections that involved canon and musket salvos. The canon salvos lacked the low-end reach and even the sequences with musket fire seemed to be dynamically compressed. The team responsible for the reissue may have assumed that the sonic impact of the canons and muskets we had with the earlier disc would be too much for most TV speaker systems, or even outboard audio systems that had anemic subwoofers. They did not want set owners to rage about destroyed speakers.

The third release was a DVD, and it improved somewhat on the second laserdisc. However, even it seemed to lack the impact of the first disc. Worse, the length was dialed back to 254 minutes - an artistic blunder. The disc, being an early DVD, also had the program split between two sides, and in spite of the extra surface space the disc seemed to have some tracking problems with some players (both of mine, for example). I have read elsewhere that this was not unusual, and so I ended up ordering a fourth version from Amazon.

This one was a blu-ray item - and included a second disc that included three featurettes on the making of the movie, plus a booklet built into the disc holder that offered up some historical information, as well as information about the main actors. The movie disc itself has running commentary options by historians James McPherson and Craig Symonds. A nice, tidy item, this set.

Best of all, this fourth version combined the best technical aspects of the previous ones into a terrific visual and DTS-audio package. Indeed, the canon and musket cacophonies were now more emphatic than ever. I have watched a lot of action movies over the years, and while the individual canon thuds were no more powerful than many other explosions I have experienced with various dynamic action movies on my AV system, the combined impact of dozens of thuds piled on in close succession was in a class by itself. I am convinced that many subwoofer systems (or woofers on AV rigs that do not use subwoofers) would be damaged beyond practical use if the volume were played loud enough for the dialog throughout the rest of the movie to be properly audible. Technically, this is a stupendous, demo-grade blu-ray disc that demands a serious audio playback rig.

It is also a stupendous story. The actors were very well chosen for their roles, with all of the principles doing standout work. There have been criticisms of Sheen as general Lee, but I do not agree. Perhaps someone like Jason Robards might have been better (Robards looked more like Lee than Sheen, which is what my southern-born wife thinks), but Robards was 70 at the time the movie was made and Lee was in his middle fifties, the same age as Sheen was when he played the part.

Anyway, Sheen played Lee the way I see Lee. Some (major fans of Lee, we can be sure) have criticized how Sheen made Lee seem almost deluded when rationalizing the potential effectiveness of the charge on the third day. However, to my way of thinking Lee almost had to be deluded and over-optimistic about what his army could do. He had to be so to think that Picketts 15,000 men could traverse a mile of open space while under fire from every gun on the Union line within range. General Longstreet, as played by Tom Berenger, was the only fully rational and aware Confederate with authority involved during the battle. Longstreet wanted to have the army shift position to better ground and fight a defensive battle, but unfortunately he could not get Lee, who was looking for a fight, to make that move and did not have enough authority to veto the charge.

Regarding that charge, the movie was done before the kind of CGI abilities we have these days, so the men involved with the movie version were real men - Civil War re-enactors who had the chance of a lifetime to do a large scale presentation. There were not as many as in the original charge (perhaps only a third as many), but judicious and skillful camera usage allowed for a scene that is unforgettable. Incidentally, Ted Turner, who helped finance the movie, had a small and brief part in the move that those with sharp eyes will spot pretty quickly. Documentarian Ken Burns also had a small, and equally brief part.

Anyway, the movie is terrific. It probably would be a good idea for those not apprised of just what transpired during those three days to read an internet summary or two (or maybe even a book about the war in general) in order to get an idea of what was going on. The movie covers only parts of the overall encounter (even though those parts presented were manifestly important), and a bit of background should make the viewing more meaningful than ever. I also suggest that a viewing of the Ken Burns documentary on the whole war would be a rewarding experience.",1490918400,20,5962,4.66952380952381

I thought most helpful the Gen Euwell (sp?) lack of aggressiveness on day one is expanded upon- previously, after many multiple viewings I wasn't sure what had happened.
Most importantly, I want to share that it is a nontraditional (i.e., sporadic) commentary.  I believe I erroneously thought I was failing to find the commentary previously (ok, I bought a new Blu Ray player) - note it begins at chapter 3 with an explanation that it is sporadic (i.e., only occasional and non-scheduled issues -- but it is very interesting commentary by historians and the director.)  If I had known how limited the commentary was I may  not have bought it - but I will restate that it is interesting points from several perspectives.",1482796800,,864,4.8108108108108105

Lee in this movie and, frankly, I'm not sure why he felt the need to portray him as delusional.  Robert E. Lee was not delusional.  He was a military genius and so polished, so regal that even the northerners, upon seeing him, would say, ""I wish he were ours!""  You will fall in love with General Longstreet, General Pickett and Colonel Chamberlain.  Incidentally, the actor who plays Pickett in this movie also plays Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson in the prequel. Bottom line, this movie is worth watching, but don't forget how long it is!  We tried to break it up into two nights of entertainment but since it was a 24 hour rental it cut us off before we were done on night two.

A great cast with Jeff Daniels as a standout. Photography 1.85:1 fills the screen with great detail.

I view all my films on an 8ft wide movie screen via a Benq Video Projector with a 50,000 :1 contrast ratio thus giving the cinema quality that ALL films need. You certainly get immersed in the events you view.

482276,5,6302548748,"This movie is like the original Star Wars movie.  Whatever the merits of the movie itself, things get multiplied by 100 because of the amazing music  Then you combine that with incredible performances by Sam Elliott and Jeff Daniels, and you have a truly remarkable film.  Jeff Daniels should have won an Oscar.  And then there are just these amazing individual scenes sprinkled throughout the film by various actors including John Diehl and Royce Applegate, and by the re-enactors themselves - like when the Iron Brigade is marching into battle to the tune of Frog in the Well on fife and drum.  When my son saw this movie with me, he asked, ""who were the good guys - the guys in the blue uniforms or the guys in the gray uniforms?""  I responded that this was hard for me to say as a native Virginian but the guys in the blue uniforms were the good guys.  If all these die-hard sympathizers of the Southern ""cause"" can see this film and reach the same conclusion, as well as those who persist in wanting reparations for slavery even after the sacrifices of the Union Army to set their ancestors free, then this country will go a long way toward healing its wounds.",1472515200,,1165,4.519047619047619
482277,4,6302548748,"Faithful reproduction of the book Killers' Angels, this film is often taken by students of Gettysburg Leadership training as a shortcut.  However, the problem is half the leadership challenges the Generals faced were in their heads -  how they size up the moments, their leaders, their enemy etc and the circumstances that affected their judgments, some of which were monumental turning points in the battle. The actors I felt were constrained by the book characterization and had less opportunity to express the characters more fully.  General Lonstreet, for example, is a good case in point.  He sits around in the movie a lot. Hidden by the big beard, Berenger had little chance to express his internal turmoil. A pity.",1472515200,,722,5.042016806722689

This one was based on a novel, so forget about watching a documentary to begin with.  The writing, the casting, the directing and overall production made for a movie that puts you in the moment from start to finish.  We may never see as quality an effort to depict the Civil War in general, and Gettysburg in particular again in our lifetimes.

Perhaps by necessity, the film makers omitted some very important parts of the battle including the insubordination of Northern General Sickles and the fighting in the wheat field during the second day. The movie really only covers the opening clashes as the armies run into each other, the fighting on Little Round Top, and Pickett's charge. Still, the movie captures the essence of the battle and hits on how it may have unfolded differently if Stonewall Jackson had been alive and present, especially during the first day. Tom Berenger puts in a very good performance as Southern General Longstreet. Martin Sheen's portrayal as General Lee is credible. Jeff Daniels' performance as Colonel Chamberlain is the best that I have seen of his. The movie is very long so set aside some time.",1466812800,,940,5.0256410256410255

The book is better of course since the movie has to cut down the amount of content and thus it loses some of the in-depth portraits of the real people.  Still, the movie is so well done it encourages the discussion about the North-South differences that persist today, 150 years later.  Also, the waste of war is palatable.  What contributions to the world did we miss due to the absolutely tragic slaughter of soldiers on both sides?  The bravery they showed likely would have been put to amazing use had they lived in a peaceful time. Great lessons of leadership in this movie and great conversation starters for kids old enough to understand that conflicts always have at least 2 sides and true leaders should be able to accurately espouse the positives and negatives on all sides before deciding to take action. All officers ran into challenges during the battle of Gettysburg when they forgot (or were unwilling) to do so.",1462320000,2,961,4.765060240963855

482930,5,6302548748,"Darn, I though I wrote a review for this movie long ago, but this is by far the best movie about the Civil War I've ever seen. Probably because my avocation is the history of modern warfare, and Ted Turner who worked like hell to get the US Government and National Park Service to let them film this masterpiece on the actual Gettysburg National Cemetery. But while Tom Berringer was great, the guy who I never expected to play Robert Edward Lee as the Confederate commander was by a performance turned in by Martin Sheen, who played the part of Lee as both brilliant and lucky, at least until the battle starts getting underway, when you know Lee's stubbornness has led him to realize as Gen. George Pickett makes his famous charge across almost two miles of open land rising up to seminary ridge, where the union had superiority on the high ground, and finally the rebs had lost so many men, Lee knew he had lost the most decisive battle of the war, and with it, the CSA. So I say this if you've never been a fan of war movies, remember.this is your history, and if Lincoln hadn't kept sending one telegram after another, looking for that ""go-to' general, and when it was all over, Lincoln scolded Gen. Meade for letting Lee's army escape across the Pontomac back to southern territory. If Meade had done what President Lincoln, who was so desperate to end the war wanted, he would have charged down from his high ground and killed as many of Lee's men, even the wounded, as possible, taken the souths artillery, and finally taken Gen. Lee and his senior generals as Prisoner, which would have ended the war, July 5, 1863. The last day of the battle and Picketts charge were on July 4, 1863.",1462147200,5,1693,4.5

483033,5,6302548748,"This is one of my favorite war films.  The Civil War was fought by men.  If you come away from watching this movie wondering how you could line up in a line of battle formation, see your enemy do the same, then stand there and exchange fire while your friends are dying and being horribly wounded, then you are forming a mature understanding of the Civil War.  The war may have started with ""manly"" concepts of courage and valor, but that soon was lost amid the carnage.",1460505600,,470,4.379310344827586
483034,3,6302548748,"Even with its epic length and scope, we only see three skirmishes.

Lee's army of the south approached Gettysburg from the north, while Meade's northern army approached from the south, which I've always found interesting.

In this movie we see the day 1 battle where A.P. Hill's division pushed the union cavalry back to Cemetery Ridge. What is not shown is that Lee, knowing he had the advantage over the union forces, ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Ridge. Ewell, believing the union positions too strong, did not follow his orders and did nothing. By late afternoon and early evening, Hancock moved in, further strengthening Cemetery Ridge and had forces move to Little Round Top.

This is most likely the day the battle was lost for the south.

For day 2 of the battle we see the stunning defense of Little Round Top by the 20th Maine under the brilliant leadership of Chamberlin. I won't go into this because most people know the story. In the movie this is all we see, however the battle was raging over miles of ground. Lee had ordered an early morning attack, however Longstreet delayed and the attack did not take place until late in  the afternoon, giving union troops more time to fortify their positions and move reinforcements to the battle lines. The southern attacks ranged from Culp's Hill on the union right, to Little Round Top on the union left. Southern forces took the peach orchard and Devil's Den.

For day 3 we see Picket's Charge. This is a well executed scene, although it's clean for such a massive attack. By clean I mean we're not witness to the devastating wounds suffered by the men who walked nearly a mile across an open field facing down an entrenched enemy with superior numbers. What we don't see in the movie is Federal forces pushing the Confederates off Culp's Hill after a 7 hour battle.

Now I understand the difficulty with showing such a massive battle, however I believe if they had spent less time waxing poetic and talking about ""...the issue shall be decided here,"" and ""...we're fighting for the greater cause, the freedom of all men,"" more time could have been spent actually showing the grand scope of this battle.

Also I found the movie doing a great disservice to the leadership of Lee. This movie portrays Lee as unwilling to cede the ground to the enemy. What we see is a man so taken with the ability of his men, up to this point Lee had not lost a battle, I think, that he was willing to drive his men into a well entrenched enemy with far superior numbers. Longstreet is shown trying to persuade Lee to fall back and Lee orders the attacks anyway.

The truth is, had Ewell followed orders on day 1, Confederates would have held the high ground on Little Round Top and very well may have pushed the union forces out of Cemetery Ridge. Had Longstreet had his division ready and attacked early on the morning of day 2, as ordered, union forces would not have had time to bring in more reinforcements. None of this was shown, which gives the casual observer of history the misguided conclusion the Confederates lost due to Lee's ineffectual command, which is clearly not the case. Lee understood the land and knew what union forces would do, he anticipated this and gave clear orders to counteract union plans. Had Lee's orders been followed by his generals Lee very well may have won the battle, had a clear road to Washington, and forced Lincoln to the negotiating table.

Of course this is simple speculation on my part because we all know what happened. I would have preferred a more accurate telling of the battle.",1459814400,,3574,4.640822784810126

483124,5,6302548748,"This is a tremendous movie both historically and movie wise for entertainment value.  The acting is first rate across the board as it opens with the great Sam Elliott playing General John Buford who discovered this great land to fight upon and is determined to not lose it while others dither away thus leaving it for the enemy to own and use to kill his brave men in Blue. Not this General who it was said  : Was no one to trifle with.  No better description was said of the Unions best cavalry officer. This whole scene is played out in tis great and tense drama leading up to Day 1 and the remaining 2 days of Gettysburg and the other heroic Generals and men who fought there on those days.  The only piece of acting that I found wanting was in Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. The actor sure tried hard but one historian wrote that the best way to picture Hancock was to picture John Wayne's characters come to life in the personification of Hancock.  Admittedly a tough road to hoe for any actor but a better choice could have been made to try it.  Jeff Daniels , like Sam Elliot, took ownership of playing his figure of Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain,  a totally remarkable man whos combination of intellect, eloquence and military bravery were a unique and rare combination indeed.  But all true, as we find in such rare people when they are found in history. It just so happens that several such men appeared at Gettysburg and are portrayed in this movie in such an excellent an d accurate manner that one can only salute admire and be thankful they were present to win that battle against a like group on the other side.  Mention must be made of Tom Beranger's excellent portrayal of General James Longstreet, known as Pete among his friends.  I recommend this movie to all who are serious about learning and also for those who just want to watch a fantastic movie too.",1455580800,,1876,4.491176470588235

483128,4,6302548748,"I have a passing interest in the battle of Gettysburg and a desire to see its legacy fully remembered by all Americans.  I saw this a few years ago on television and at the time was able only to drop in and out of viewing.  But  I recalled that there was a degree of historical accuracy and was impressed with Daniels as Chamberlin.  I've been wanting to revisit the film to see if it still held up and to give it a fairer and more attentive viewing.
This time through I was still impressed with Daniels, but also with the portrayal of his brother, his sergeant and General Armitage. Richard Jordon now often plays the tough political boss on TV, but he provides a nuanced performance as Armitage. The remainder of the cast was adequate.  It is a long movie and with a more attentive eye, many portions seem to move slowly.  However watching it this second time on a large screen and in HD, I was stunned by many visuals of the battlefield in  scope, color and composition.  No one should rely upon any movie to be the sole record of this historical battle, but it is a valuable addition for those who have some knowledge and it is a good beginning for those who have little exposure to this momentous event.",1455580800,,1208,4.385650224215246

It's obviously very long, but it never drags and has the ability to hold the viewer's attention (at least it did for me).  The movie has action aplenty, great acting, a good musical score by Randy Edelman, and good special effects.  Countless Civil War re-enactment infantries from around the country helped with the filming of the battle scenes.  The DVD comes with extras such as audio commentary, a documentary called The Making Of Gettysburg, narrated by Martin Sheen, and a documentary called The Battle Of Gettysburg, narrated by Leslie Nielsen.

483251,4,6302548748,"Overall a good Civil War epic movie. Historically accurate uniforms and equipment. A couple of negatives were several of the combat scenes were excruciatingly long...this contributed to the 4+ hour movie (that's a very long movie to sit through for anyone). It seemed to me that the portrayal of Robert E. Lee was off base. They made him seem delusional and unsure of his own leadership, which he was not. The movie downplayed his Christian character which he was known for. If you are a student of the Civil War it is worth your time (4+ hours) to watch this movie.",1453680000,,566,4.6138613861386135

483375,5,6302548748,"This is one of the finest historical movies ever filmed in my opinion.  It was originally produced by Ted Turner as a miniseries for TV and as such it could not be considered for an Oscar ... which is a BIG shame because Jeff Daniels, who portrays the real-life Professor/Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, SHOULD have won an Oscar.  Others such as Stephen Lang, who portrays General George Pickett should also have won big as well as others in the cast.  The producers, actors, & Director all studied many accounts, written history & letters written by the actual soldiers and have made a film that is wonderfully free of typical Hollyweird BS which is often inserted in film productions for the sake of ""action"" or other garbage only to ramp up sales.  It was filmed on locations in or near Gettysburg or in other locations resembling the area as well as some parts of the actual battleground itself, thanks to the U.S. Parks Department.  They allowed the film crew & cast a few days to film in the Park itself.  The best example of this is the film's use of the hallowed ground where the legendary Pickett's Charge actually took place.  It can't get any more realistic than that!  This BluRay is the extended version & Director's cut and is definitely worth the price and well-worth watching for ANY Living History re-enactor, student, History Buff, or simply someone who likes movies based on real and/or Historical events.
The film is a screen adaptation of the book ""The Killer Angels"" by the late Michael Shaara which has been required reading at the U.S. Army war college for Army officers.
I'd give this 6 stars if I could!",1447286400,11,1634,4.708771929824562
483376,5,6302548748,"I love this movie so much. I have always been fascinated by the Civil War and this is the best adaptation of events I have seen in a very long time. Granted, they don't really mention Buford and had it not been for him the Union probably would have not held their ground and I am a bit surprised that he wasn't in this so much and it really does seem to focus more around the tactical mistakes of the South but it is still a fantastic movie that sis entertaining for history buffs as well as for people new to this era of American War history.

With him and his wife i recently revisited the battle field which i had not been to in over 35 years. WHAT A DIFFERENCE from my last visit they have taken the battlefield back to it's original state form 1860's. If you make the trip to Gettysburg spend a few days and really study the Battle. Now before i got the movie that's what i did, Now as you watch the movie from Cemetery Ridge to the finally Day of the battle the movie makes it come to life and you feel it more cause you were there. Even without the visit here first you will enjoy the movie. It is the best recreation of the Battle I've ever seen! Buy Me!

Needless to say, he fell asleep 1 hour into this disaster. BUT....he was asleep on me. And I couldn't get up! So here I was, trapped on the couch, his snoring ass snuggled up on me, and I couldn't reach the remote. I was effing trapped. Trapped and watching this god awful movie!

  I would like to add that this movie will make Lee look somewhat incompetent for some decisions he makes but make no mistake about it, Lee was a brilliant tactician and strategist who did unbelievable things when the odds were mostly against him. And the battle of Gettysburg wasn't as lopsided as you'd expect. The casualty numbers were fairly mutual and the Union had something like 20,000 more men than the confederates and were far better equipped.

Jeff Daniels, Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang steal the show.",1445385600,,655,4.821428571428571

Negatives I guess are the production is not super high, it is OK but a little corny at times.  The soldiers are reenactors and one has to overlook the overly high age of the troops and the overly ""well fed"" attribute.  For walking as much as they did living on a sometimes short supply of food these guys are remarkably husky.

Lee.  While many great actors performances made this movie worth viewing, it truly rests on Sheen as having iced the proverbial cake.

Gettysburg is a monumental undertaking both historically and in this film.  Writer/Director Room Maxwell treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves.  He neither dwells on the North or the South's cause but that of the forces who were involved.

Jeff Daniels' performance as Colonel [Joshua] Lawrence Chamberlain is also to be very well commended.  He gives life to the noted Maine commander.

I like Martin Sheen's performance though he seemed confused at times. I think Tom Berenger did a good job as Pete Longstreet,but my favorite performance of the film was Richard Jordan as lo Armistead the great Brigade Leader  who was the only Confederate commander to breach the line at Gettysburg. the only problem I have with the movie were some of the shots of the Confederate officers who we about 300 pounds. it will be hard for a man to walk from Virginia to  Pennsylvania eating only a handful of dried corn per day  and still stay that fat.

There are plenty of positive comments on this movie already and so I will simply note one minor irritation. Although I do understand that this was based on the book ""The Killing Angles"" I do wish that the screenplay would have fleshed out the Union side better. Most of the main characters are southern, save for Jeff Daniels. As a result one cannot help but feel the movie a tad unbalanced as it gives the impression that gallantry was solely a southern trait. Being Minnesotan I will indulge my own bias and say that I was saddened not to see the dramatic charge of the 1st Minnesota during the climatic moments of Picket's Charge. With extremely high casualty rates the 1st Minnesotan has at times been credited for holding the center and thus saving the battle.",1436572800,,854,4.662251655629139

AND I don't appreciate at all what they did to Kathleen Mavourneen, the song that is playing during Armistead's soliloquy about Almira Hancock.  The sound is almost non-existent, Armistead says, ""hear that?"" and nothing is playing.....which then makes Armistead and Longstreet stand there giving each other meaningful looks for about 3 minutes with NO SOUND.

Hello?

We had the TV turned up all the way, we put the stereo speakers on, there is NO VOLUME to this song.  And this song is half the theme that continues into the Gods and Generals movie.  This is just entirely Uncool.

There is one very important part of the battle that is not shown in the movie. JEB Stuart CSA commanded 4,000 cavalry. He was ordered by R.E. Lee to flank the Union positions and attack and destroy the Union artillery. When Stuart flanked the Union he was met by 200 Union cavalry ( Michigan Wolverines). JEB Stuart retreated from the field.

The movie should honestly have been re-titled "" The Killer Angels- Gettysburg"". The blu-ray bookset here is an excellent collection to have. For some the movie maybe long but history lovers will love the attention to detail and accuracy of story and scenes. A great benefit of this movie is that the scene of Pickett's Charge was actually filmed on the same spot of Pickett's Charge  at Gettysburg National Battlefield. I walked the same path of the charge from ridge to ridge. Awesome courage of all these men under fireThe rest of the movies filmed on actual location or nearby.

Shortcomings?  sure.  I was reminded (I have seen this movie 3 times over the past many years) how mediocre some of the acting is and the lack of realism and energy between the characters in the speechy scenes.  Regarding the acting, my guess is the director recruited amateurs from the ranks of the re-enactors who played the rank and file troops.  But you have to lay it on the professionals for the flatness of many of the dialogue scenes - especially the writers - who must have lifted whole passages from the novel on which the movie was based.  People simply don't converse in long-winded. barrages without others commenting and reacting.

If you like history, American history, Civil War history, get it.  I am not a Civil War buff, because it depresses me. In some ways there may have been too many reminders of this war, but in other ways, maybe there has not been enough said.

I love Martin Sheen, but not as s Confederate officer. He did not convince me at all. Sorry, Sir. You are one of my favorites, but you seemed unsure of yourself. When did this happen?  The other castings seemed good to me, but I do not know all that much. I do know something about country people and the pride of the south. I am aware of the devastation and waste, from which it has never recovered. The extreme poverty is still a reminder that innocents suffer when there is such conflict.. All that killing, confusion and hurt. I do think this movie shows both sides of the war about as well as it could have been done. It was such a shame though, and this gets to me.

I will probably watch it again when I feel objective. I am on neither side, so to speak, as most I would presume, but if you are of very strong opinions, you will doubtless do a more interesting review than me.",1429920000,,1263,4.1387755102040815

What's fascinating is this is actually historically authentic, the Civil War period was one of the most literate times in history, remember there was no television, radio, facebook, or twitter. Communication was an art form, and regarded as a form of expression, not just a skill. Some of the movie's most poignant speeches are by Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a professor of rhetoric, Chamberlain was fluent in nine languages and had studied for three years at seminary, prior to becoming a professor at Bowdoin College.

GETTYSBURG
ADDRESS

Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
 on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
 dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
 whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
 dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-
field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
 that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
 their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether
 fitting and proper that we should do this.
  But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicatewe cannot
 consecratewe cannot hallowthis ground. The brave men,
 living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it
 far above our poor power to add or detract. The world
 will little note nor long remember what we say here, but
 it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the
 living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
 work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
 advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
 great task remaining before usthat from these honored
 dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
 they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here
 highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain;
 that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
 freedom; and that government of the people, by the people,
 for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

All superstars. Martin Sheen gives the performance of his lifetime as General Robert E Lee only to have Sam Elliot set the bar so high in the first 30 minutes of the film as Calvary Gen. John Buford. And Tom Berringer as Gen. James Longstreet was sheer brilliance. And we never see Lincoln in this entire film.

This production covered Gettysburg, the famous and pivotal battle in Pennsylvania which, along with Vicksburg, marked the 'high tide' of the Confederacy before the long and certain descent to Appomattox and surrender.
The film got mixed reviews when it first came out.  This was due to the casting of Martin Sheen portraying a very different looking Robert E. Lee, as well as the well-known production difficulties.  The re-enactors were selected in an open call and not selectively.  As a result, the average age of the soldiery portrayed was higher, if not much higher, than was the case in 1863.
In any case, the film covered the important points:
General Lee's 2nd ill-fated invasion of the north(the 1st had led to Antienam).  He encounters General Meade, just appointed.  Lee wants to maneuver and not fight but his subordinates almost all fail him, leading to unwanted combat, a delayed attack(Little Round Top) and the final disastrous attack(Pickett's Charge).  As Lee said after it was all over: 'this is all my fault'.  If only he had surrendered after the battle...
The film actually is centered not around Lee or Meade but around Colonel Chamberlain(Jeff Daniels) who has to hold a key hill at the flank of the Union position.  If it is lost, then all is lost.  They literally fight to the last man and conduct a last desperate attack that wins the day, the battle, and, eventually, the war.
The film covers such an important event that the particulars of whether this re-enactor was right, that actor was mis-cast, etc. is unimportant.  The script, the score, the effects were all just good enough to show us the grandest battle ever conducted in North America.  For war and history buffs, this is a must-have.",1418083200,2,1795,4.930232558139535

I knew they are in pose that has been made historic by photos but really - the driector should not allowed them to stick out --- after all the inviduals posed for photos in 1863 and these were staged -- so these few folks stick out.

A very long film - some bad lines and greatly over play from time to time. It is almost like wealness or strength is over acted and poorly in some cases ---- but this is an epic film covering a section of American history the has many points of view.

This color, 2-sided, single, DVD-disc, depicting the horrific war that almost tore this Great Nation apart, is nothing short of spectacular in it's historical detail, broad scope and brilliant presentation. Without a doubt, this movie is awesome! Meticulously researched together with a cast of hundreds, Warner Brothers Pictures mesmerizes the viewing audience with this big-screen, epic, masterpiece! America's darkest four years are painstakingly reenacted with detailed and privileged information as documented by written accounts, diaries, personal letters and military correspondence. In addition too, oral interpretation and testimonials of what actually transpired during those sad and fateful days. This is a long and compelling film and not a documentary of the Northern States verses the Southern States. The Union against the Confederacy. The Blue verses the Gray. The ""Yanks"" against the ""Rebs."" The Union North lost a terrible battle at Fredericksburg but they came back with a vengeance, at: GETTYSBURG. Father against son, brother against brother and unbelievably, Americans against Americans, on American soil. This intense battle was not just about physical combat and military strategy. But moreso, about fundamental ideology, slavery of the Black Man and President Lincoln's historic address as written and surmised within his Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the Negro slaves. GETTYSBURG is a colossal film that captives the beholder, even if they don't know a thing about American history. Traditionally, July the 4th is the Day when the United States commemorates and celebrates it's National Independence. But, what many don't realize, is that very same date is also the very same weekend in 1863, in which America fought against and almost destroyed itself. In one of the most horrific and bloodiest battles at GETTYSBURG. Which was nothing short of a climactic Civil War battle that almost permanently severed the unity of the States and nearly obliterated the combined Independence which the citizens of the United States fought so hard to achieve during the Revolutionary War. This intense, turning-point of the war, battle depiction at GETTYSBURG is both mesmerizing in portrayal and very interesting in content. It's a pictoral education and a whopper of an entertainer. The Civil War in it's entirety almost annihilated the United States of America, as we know it, today: The UNITED STATES. Which is still - thank God!, under one American President and under one American Flag. Whether it's GETTYSBURG or any other military battle..., I pray that Americans in physical combat against American's, will forever remain in past history books and that the dark and utterly devastating days of a Civil War, will never again, erupt on American soil. Enough blood has been spilled and it's time to come together and remain the UNITED STATES, that are Founding Father's intended it to be!

484623,4,6302548748,"I first saw this movie almost 20 years ago when it was first released.  Since then, it has stayed in my mind as one of the best American history movies I have ever seen.  So when I saw that there was an extended edition available on Blu-Ray, I purchased it.  Watching it again a second time, after a decade plus of learning about the history, I am still as impressed.  The movie begins with a beautiful orchestration of classical music, original to this film, played over glimpses of black and white pictures of major characters in this pivotal battle.  The movie then unfolds as scenes that alternate between the POV of Union and Confederate soldiers.  Every key officer from each side is featured in this film, often with a speaking role.  One could call this one of the best ensemble cast movies ever made.  The movie serves both as a drama and as an action film.  There are lot and lots of shooting scenes, but these are explained by scenes of dialog where the officers on each side argue out strategy, political goals, along with battlefield goals.  Also of key importance is the inclusion of a British government representative accompanying the Southern officers.  Unknown to most Americans, the British empire supported the South with money and occasional military aid in hopes of dividing the USA permanently.  This foreign presence in the US Civil War is left out in just about every other Civil War movie, but is included her.

The only downsides to this film was its subtle but strong glorification of the Confederacy.  The questions of slavery, tariffs, and free trade, which were the underlying political differences between North and South, are relegated to several minutes of on-screen dialogue.  Instead, the South is portrayed as an army of eloquent gentlemen, with village neighbors enlisting, fighting and dying together.  As such, this movie is a clear example of how the South has owned the discussion of the Civil War since it ended.

The product quality itself was lackluster.  The visual clarity was comparable to a DVD, but below par compared to any other Blu-Ray that I own.  In short, it seems the producers just put the film onto a Blu-Ray and called it good.",1409961600,,2187,4.7994652406417115

484842,3,6302548748,"I've viewed some 9 hours of A/V material on Gettysburg. This 4-hour movie was by far the worst.. Here's what I found, rank-ordered from best to worst:

1) Gettysburg: The Battle and the Address
(Discovery Channel; [...])

This is actually two 50-min videos on one DVD.

Gettysburg: The Battle has more information than any other source we've seen. It's the only one that actually fully explained things like Pickett's Charge (every G'burg video and movie covers this, but they all, except this, leave out major context). Good visuals; high production values, marred only by some wooden acting. If you can see only one Gettysburg item, this'd be it.

Gettysburg: The Address is OK, but largely forgettable, except for a hilariously bad CGI Lincoln, who looks like a reject character from Planet of the Apes. (If your interest is the Address, PBS' LINCOLN@GETTYSBURG [...] is much better investment of an hour of your life.)

2) The War Zone: The American Civil War: The Battle of Gettysburg
([...])

Good 3D maps help create a context and perspective; actually, the best maps of the bunch. Overall, the information is good, but the production values (except for the maps) are pretty low. Many talking heads. Many of the visuals are rotoscoped versions of video from #3, below. But despite the recycled visuals from #3, the information content is higher than #3, with much better context.

3) War File: History of Warfare: Battle of Gettysburg
([...])

Visually OK, with large-scale reenactments on the actual battleground. Lots of talking head stuff. Information is OK, but lacks contextual information. (E.G. a talking head, standing on the battlefield, says something like, ""We're a mile from where we were. The lines formed over there..."" but the camera doesn't pan to show where he's pointing, or where the previous setup was; and there are few maps to help orient you.) Some of the reenactment segments were rotoscoped and used in #2, above, but with better contextual info added.

4) Gettysburg (the 4-hour movie available from Amazon)
(also: [...])

Surprisingly, despite its length, this was the least informative of them all. For example, its treatment of Lee's decision to order Pickett's Charge makes Lee seem detached and driven by some dreamy, mystical vision of success. But ""Gettysburg: The Battle"" (#1, above) shows the Charge was only half of a much larger, entirely rational plan involving a massive, coordinated Confederate cavalry attack from the rear of the Union Lines; that could well have succeeded, if the cavalry attack had gone as planned.

There were other missing facts --- how can you produce a 4 hour docudrama and end up with less information than a 50 minute TV show? --- and odd overemphasis of minor characters.

The best part of this movie is the hilarious (and mostly fake) beards, which make many of the actors look like they spread spirit gum on their faces, and then rolled around in road kill. (""Is that a beard, or does he have a dead badger glued to his face?"")",1398643200,,3003,4.9483101391650095

484844,4,6302548748,"This is a good depiction of one of the most important battles of the American Civil War. It is not great. The production values are variable. Impressive masses of soldiers, apparently no CGI, Too much music. Too many long, dramatic soliloquies. And the makeup of all the bearded people is not as good as one would expect for a four hour movie production. The most impressive thing to me in this modern world is a lack of intelligence about the Battlefield, which makes the troop movements very impressive, for commanders to be able to evaluate and make accurate tactical decisions. I have read quite a bit about this battle, and it continues to be a mystery why Lee did not take the advice of Longstreet and instead insisted on a frontal assault on the strong position. Neither was there any depiction of the issue of pursuing the retreating Confederates and essentially disabling their army. Lincoln ordered it, and it would be important to know why the field commanders did not take action.",1397865600,,992,4.773255813953488

484922,5,6302548748,"Living in south central Pennsylvania, I have a built-in interest in the Battle of Gettysburg.  I worked with a man who was a civil war re-enactor.  We watched this movie so many times that we could trade sections of dialogue while we worked.  No one movie could tell the full story of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the book that it is based on (The Killer Angels) was listed as fiction.  So Gettysburg is not anywhere near a definitive telling of the story.  What Gettysburg does is take the best characters from the Union and Confederate side and tells their part in the three day battle.  All of the actors seemed to embrace their roles, and they all did their best to show them in a sympathetic light.  Tom Berenger deserves particular praise for his portrayal of General Longstreet.  He gave us such an insight into Longstreet's conflict during the battle.  Jeff Daniels was great as well, portraying the college professor Joshua Chamberlain.  I barely knew who he was or the significance of the swinging door maneuver that saved the Union's left flank on Little Round Top.  Even General Pickett, played by Stephen Lang, is shown in the best light possible. This is not a movie that tracks troop movements, times, and the like.

Ewell was, in reality, bald, but he has a full head of hair in the film. Hood was a young man with a lion's countenance during the war, but he is portrayed by an old(er) actor with no youthful fire.

484996,5,6302548748,"Michael Shaara's  ""The Killer Angels"" (1975) told the story of an epic battle of Gettysburg and of heroism and moral courage of Americans on both sides. The book came out during a difficult time for the United States with among other things Watergate and continued recriminations over Viet Nam.  Perhaps the book helped Americans restore faith in themselves.

I have read and written about on Amazon  ""The Killer Angels"" together with much else on Gettysburg. I have never seen this famous 1993 movie of the battle based on Shaara's book. I decided to watch ""Gettysburg"" over New Years Eve  I thought our country might be divided and unsure of itself, as was the case in 1975 with Shaara's book and in July, 1863, with the battle. I thought the movie might offer me insights in the approach of a new year.

Running at well over four hours, ""Gettysburg"" directed by Robert Maxwell filled my New Year's Eve. The movie is on a heroic scale. It offers a portrayal of each of the three days of the battle together with the preliminaries leading to the contest. Most of the story is told through the eyes of  some of the leading officers for both sides, Lee , Longstreet, Pickett, and Armistead for the Confederacy, and Chamberlain, Buford, Hancock for the Union. The movie builds up and develops some of the key engagements of the battle, including Buford and his cavalry buying time holding off the Confederate advance on July 1, Chamberlain's heroic defense of the flank on Little Round Top on July 2, and Pickett's doomed charge against the Union center on July 3. The scenes develop slowly and carefully with a great deal of dramatic tension.  There is some diffuseness in this lengthy movie but the film in its entirety easily held my attention.

Besides portraying elements of the battle, the movie focuses on the combatants and their motivations. In times of skepticism about the United States, I found these portrayals valuable. While focusing on the leading officers, ""Gettysburg"" offers a view of the diversity of both armies in terms of the backgrounds and educations of the soldiers. The movie emphasizes that the soldiers were drawn from the cities and the farms and from the wealthy and the poor. The armies included many immigrants and ethnic groups. Educational backgrounds varied widely from soldiers who were barely literate on the one hand to college professors such as Joshua Chamberlain for the Union and General Johnston Pettigrew for the Confederacy. (Chamberlain has a large, Pettigrew a cameo role in the film.)

With all the diversity in the armies and the differences between them, the film emphasizes that the soldiers knew what they were doing and why they were doing it. In the movie, Union officers and soldiers discuss the evils of slavery and the need to preserve the values of union and democracy. Confederate officers and soldiers are adamant about protecting their rights and about being left alone to live as they see fit. Both sides are weary of war and eager for peace. The soldiers on both side fight heroically for a purpose, as they understand it. The heroism, seriousness, and commitment of Americans during the days of the Civil War remains a lasting lesson.

With its focus on Buford, Chamberlain, and Pickett, ""Gettysburg"" does not purport to offer a full account of a lengthy, controversial battle. Students of the battle will find many matters omitted and many details of emphasis that could be questioned.  The film remains an excellent overview of the battle for those unfamiliar with military details. ""Gettysburg"" serves as an introduction that is valuable in itself and that may encourage an interest in viewers in exploring further.  Most importantly, the movie portrays Americans in a positive, idealistic if hard way that may held serve as an antidote to cynicism.

My New Year's Eve was well spent in seeing ""Gettysburg"" at last. The film encourages viewers to engage with America's history and with its continued promise.

484997,5,6302548748,I very much enjoyed this movie about the Battle of Gettysburg. I especially appreciated the side-by-side comparison of the actors and the actual people they portrayed. Very well done!,1388448000,,183,5.344827586206897
484998,2,6302548748,"I really get tired of Hollywood bringing us movies that are about the South, or that have characters from the South, and then always populating them with a bunch of people with fake Southern accents: it doesn't work!  Instead we get the inevitable clipped English accent and  speech filled with some kind of an overly naive philosophy that makes the whole cast seem like a bunch of Hee-Haw dolts.  The last movie I actually paid to see in the movie houses was JFK and after 3 hours of Kevin Costner's fake Southern drawl I said I've had it.

Second, I'm really sick of Hollywood intruding the action and even the ongoing dialogue with the ever-present background ""Musical Score"": We don't need it!  I wish they would let me experience the emotions of a script myself, without having to constantly embellish things.  The ever-present musical intrusion is probably a holdover from 100 years ago when the transition was made from silent films to silent films plus music. Get rid of it-- NOW!

Third, the Rebels were constantly painted as being inept in battle.  The battle scenes feature the Rebs carrying their guns over their shoulders DURING the battle even when they are only yards from the point of physical hand-to-hand combat.  They are often seen fumbling over their rifles and falling over fences like they're a bunch of drunks or something.  Meanwhile, the Yanks have it all well-organized, throwing volley after volley in precise fashion....more discrimination in my opinion.  Especially considering how close this battle really was.

Fourth, I really doubt the men back then were constantly standing around in the actual battle theater calmly discussing battle plans while bullets and shells are whizzing by and blowing up all around them.

Fifth, silly speech just doesn't belong in a movie like this. Irony and cynicism maybe.  The director seemed to feel a need to increase the impact of the tragedy of war--as if it needs any more attention--by giving us a constant feed of silly, daft, inane bits of conversation/exchange, and then followed by the inevitable intrusion of the background orchestra jolting us back to the real dread and ominous nature of combat.

Sixth, as I read civil war history (see General John Brown Gordon's ""Reminiscences of the Civil War"", chapter XI) it was Longstreet that fumbled the ball here, not once but three times, constantly delaying his assault on Little Round Top, which according to Gordon, who was actually there, would have won the battle for the South.

Altogether, the battle scenes are suitably frightening, but most of the ""regular"" action -- conversation and other activities is just too overwrought and self-consciously done.  I am glad, and feel it is fitting that this movie didn't win any Oscars.",1388275200,3,2758,4.986899563318778

485004,5,6302548748,"I saw Gettysburg for first time about 8 years ago on a rental DVD, bought it, and have watched it several times since then!!  I would say Gettysburg and Casablanca and High Noon are my 3 favorite movies!  I love history, and love to read about the Civil War,  I particularly have enjoyed reading several books on Ulysses Grant.(amazing figure, to come from working in his father's tanning shop, to becoming such a great general that Lincoln would say, ""I have a general!""  after the ones before had been rather duds!  I was pretty much blown away by this movie.  Jeff Daniels blew me away, from near the start when he talks to the mutineers, the movie had me.  The parts I was most moved by and just stunned by were when Richard Jordan (Gen. Armistead) talks to Tom Berenger (Gen Longstreet) about the possibility that he may face in some battle his good friend (from those days in California just before war broke out) union General Hancock, (Longstreet tells him Hancock is here at Gettysburg!)  unbelievable acting by Jordan, just stunning and so sad--he knows he will probably die and gives Longstreet some papers to give to Hancock's wife in case he, Armistead, dies.  Then Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain should have been given the Oscar!! (was he even nominated?)  His Battle of the Little Round Top is my next favorite part of the movie, probably close to 30 minutes long.  As another reviewer points out here (on 4/10/2000 ""A very good civil war movie"")  historians view  ""this small unit action""  (by the part of the 20th Maine)  to be one of the defining moments of history--I would think they probably mean world history, as I guess historians feel  if Little Round Top was lost, Gettysburg would have been lost, the South would have won the war, and American history would be very different--this great experiment in democracy failed!!!  Jeff Daniels is just stunning as he realizes there is nothing left to do (""if we stay here we can't fight --(they have run out of bullets) and we leave they will run over us and the whole hill will be lost "" (to paraphrase what he said) and thus the battle will be lost, the war will be lost, and the country will be lost.  So the only thing they can do is to take the desperate measure of drawing their sabers and charging.  It is just stunning to see the faces of his men as he is telling them this, his Major Ellis Spears asking , ""You mean charge?"" and the men are stunned, but Chamberlain says, ""Well, we'll have the advantage as we are going downhill.""  I just feel the whole Little  Round Top 30 minute sequence is some of the best movie making ever!!  The music, Jeff's talking to his men, the camera work and the music as he moves up and down his line of men.  When he yells, ""Bayonets!""  he looks absolutely crazed, I love that either the director or Jeff felt he should look crazed as he yells at the top of his lungs so all can hear him, I mean it is almost ludicrous how crazy he looks--his eyes bulge out-- when he yells ""Bayonets""  but I think it was neat that he did this, he is trying to yell as loud as he can, and at this point who wouldn't be crazed--you may die in a few seconds, your brother may die, and your dear friends and fellow soldiers may die!!!  And when Major Ellis yells charge and then Chamberlain yells charge and down the hill they go--into history--well, unbelievable movie making and gorgeous music!!  The last part I love, but no one here I think has commented about,  is the absolutely poignant 2 scenes with Gen Longstreet (Berenger) and his artillery commander, the 28 year old Col Porter Alexander played by the English/American actor James Patrick Stuart (who I see is in the TV show Supernatural--which I have never watched but am going to! to see his movie and TV credits just google him).  The first scene, Longstreet is talking to Alexander about making sure he fires enough artillery to clear the Union cannons off Cemetary Ridge before Pickett can move, and then a short while later, the 2nd scene is utterly poignant:  Alexander tells him that they had to move the remaining ammunition further to the rear so union cannons wouldn't destroy it, and Longstreet is frustrated as there are still too many union cannons firing; their conversation you might not get the first time, I didn't, because they are practically yelling at each other to be heard, it is noisy, but then watching it again, I listened better, and understood better what they were saying;  Longstreet ends by telling him (paraphrasing) ""Just keep firing, we have got to clear those cannons off that ridge!!""  They salute each other, and Alexander kind of lets his hand fall from his salute in a hesitant, defeated way, as Longstreet turns and leaves; and Alexander then takes off his hat in the most dejected, sad, and poignant manner you can imagine!  As he does this and turns and pauses with his hat on his chest for a second, it looks like a painting, young 28 year old Col Alexander is so handsome with his dark hair and beard and mustache, in his beautiful artillery commander long coat gray uniform with red accents (!!).  I was just blown away by this! What acting!!!  I have the 2000 issued DVD and the 2 scenes with Longstreet and Porter are on side B (yes the 4 hour plus DVD has 2 sides!)  and these Longstreet/Porter scenes  are scene #10 and the end of scene #16 (this is the sad, poignant one).  The Little Round Top segment is on side A, and runs from scene 28 -  scene 35 !!  Just want to say also, as someone else mentioned here, that 60's TV actor Andrew Prine is wonderful, so good as Confederate Gen. Garnett--practically zombie like, but I thought totally believable as he is about to take part in Picketts charge, and the way he acts and what he says, it is like, this is the day, it is inevitable that this could  be the day he will die!!  I thought of all the generals, north or south, he was the best of the actors who played the generals even though his was a very small part, he and Stephen Lang as Pickett, and of course Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain;  also very good as Chamberlain's younger brother Tom is C.Thomas Howell, so good looking and earnest--too bad Thomas Howell hasn't had a more prominent career as an actor.  He was wonderful!  And the ending of the movie is so poignant (yes, I use this word a lot but it seems appropriate for this movie about one of the most tragic periods in American history), at the very end as the smoke from the battle is still in the air in a beautiful sunset on the last day of the Gettysburg battle, Lawrence and Tom find each other, and look at each other in absolute sadness but also utter disbelief that they have both survived this battle, and then just embrace for a long time, and then look again at each other again, and then Tom's shoulders just go down just as the beautiful music just goes goes ""downward""  in a beat, just so touching and sad!!  I am just a crazed older woman who loves reading, reading about history and momentous events, and I just love this movie!!  Can you tell??!!  PLEASE SEE IT, HISTORY BUFFS,  AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK!!",1387324800,5,7103,4.480963480963481
485005,5,6302548748,"The Battle of Gettysburg was the largest battle ever fought on the continent of North America. At this time, in early July of 1863, the fate of our nation was once again in question.

This was the last and best hope of the Confederate States to ultimatley defeat the Union. They almost succeeded. The potential outcome: America cut in half, establishing a new and  dangerous rival nation out of the southern half. As to whether or not the Confederacy could have continued to exist as an economically and socially viable entity is debatable. However, one factor of the Confederacy was certain during the Civil War, especially up to the events of 1863: they definitely had no shortage of excellent battlefield officers and quality fighting-men. In fact, many on both sides of the conflict beleived a Confederate victory was absolutely inevitable at Gettysburg.

Based on Michaels Shaara's novel, The Killer Angels, this movie is by far the best and most thorough portrayal of the battle, the armies, and the significant personalities on both sides.

This is particularly apparent in the scenes of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain commanding the troops of th 20th. Maine at Little Round Top. This was the utter-most left-flank of the Union defenses. Despite suffering high casualties and an ever-dwindling supply of ammunition, Colonel Chamberlain and his men held the line against repeated assaults, with very little time to reinforce the line between attacks. Finally, with ammunition thoroughly depleted, Chamberlain countered the Confederate charge with his last option: a counter-attack with bayonets! This final stubborn act of will proved to be the finishing move in decimating all Confederate efforts against Chamberlain's section of the line!

What if we did not have a man such as Colonel Chamberlain in command, or troops as determined and disciplined as the men from Maine, at that crucial point in the defenses along the ridge? In American history, this was one of many incidents in which our national destiny was saved by the right sort of men holding out against potentially overwhelming opposition. The Battle of Gettysburg is one of those incidents that not only affected the outcome of the war, but the ultimate fate of America.",1387065600,2,2237,5.151515151515151

This should not be compared to a Ken Burns documentary because it is written as a story and meant for theater or TV.  That said you won't find a movie better scripted, filmed, acted or closer to the actual events and people involved at Gettysburg than this one.

485067,5,6302548748,"I loved this movie. I was in Gettysburg Nov. 16th and 23rd for some of the events for the 150th anniversary of the dedication of Soldiers National Cemetery which occurred on November 19, 1863 where Lincoln spoke our National Prayer (the Gettysburg Address) for the freedom Of the People, By the People, and For the People, that these honored American soldiers fought to preserve, both North and South. This movie was a pleasure to watch because it was filmed at Gettysburg and some of the battles were filmed a few miles South of the actual/protected grounds. The battles, the geographic names, the people, the events, the actions, the flags and symbols, ... everything in the movie was actual fact. Of course there was even more that happened.  Please visit these sites to learn more, and if you have the chance, travel to historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. You will be surprized to find that it has been preserved to 1863. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the battle of Little Round Top and the 20th Maine, and Picketts Charge, and then to visit the actual sites and monuments and walk quietly and respectfully on those hallowed grounds. I especially loved Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee, and how painstakingly Martin memorized the actual words of the General and his demeanor and gestures and showed him very accurately and authentically (rather than putting his own narrative on it, as many actors do). [...] [...] [...]  [...]  [...]  Here is an interesting fact: did you know that Joshua Chamberlain (20th Maine) went on to become a Major General and Grant selected him to receive Lee's surrender at Appomattox.",1385078400,2,1639,4.884892086330935

The film follows the course of the battle while also weaving in personal relationships and powerful themes. The film is accompanied by a stirring soundtrack and all star performances from Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels, and Tom Berenger (to highlight a few). This rendition of Gettysburg can be a little long, but with the length you get a deep story and a good level of detail. I enjoy learning about the Civil war, and I am not a history buff. I enjoyed the way the movie detailed the battle and I didn't have a hard time following or enjoying the battle scenes. My favorite part of the film were the many speeches - from both sides.

485071,4,6302548748,"This is a review of both ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". The ratings and titles are different.

If it isn't obvious from watching these films, the director/screenwriter explains in an interview that they're intended to present an unbiased view of both North and South, without labeling anyone as good or bad, hero or villain. What then remains, he says, is the horror of war (though most of it is shown at a PG-13 level). What, then, is the /dramatic/ point?

Little, it seems. It isn't until near the end of ""Gods"" * that Jeff Daniels says what needed to have been said at the start -- that he can't understand why Southerners rant on about freedom, when they live under a system that enslaves people. The Southern argument -- that their states are their countries -- is an accurate reflection of how people felt -- indeed, of how this country was conceived (in both senses of the word) -- but it pales in comparison with the facts that not only is slavery wholly unjustifiable (unless you believe that sub-human people exist solely to earn your bread for you), and that the war was fought over the spread of slavery. Those reaching for their keyboards to accuse me of political correctness are advised to refrain.

The wide range of personal opinions on IMDb is not surprising. Northerners tend to see ""Gods"" as pro-Southern, Southerners as vindication. Neither is correct. But at a time when legislators -- many from Southern states -- are trying to exterminate the few vestiges of democracy that remain in this country -- neither film sits very well with this viewer. I would like to point out to Southern sympathizers reading this... You lost. Get over it. State's rights were trampled where they should have been trampled, and the Federal government affirmed its superiority over the states. Tough.

As for who's the better Lee, Sheen or Duvall, the decision has to come down firmly on Sheen's side. Photos of Lee suggest a dark personality, and Sheen captures this better. Duvall is a strong person, and there is -- except for a few moments near the end -- little sense of weakness, or any ambiguity in his views. It doesn't help that Sheen has several scenes of strong dramatic interaction that allow him to display Lee's character -- Duvall has only one brief ""dramatic"" moment (which he handles well). Sheen's show of fear and anguish at the end of ""Gettysburg"" is played beautifully.

Both films are worth seeing. But their attempts to present a dispassionate perspective weakens them. It might be /logical/ to ask us to show sympathy for people who are morally wrong -- but it implies that our actions are products of the Zeitgeist, uncontrollable forces we must bend to. But we can remain upright, if we choose.

PS: To the person who says Sheen's performance makes Lee look like a nut... Imagine you're a general who has just sent thousands of troops to their deaths -- which you have witnessed. How would you react?

* I interpret the use of ""Gods"" as referring to the different gods Northerners and Southerners worship. It's particularly striking (especially among the Southerners) how often they ascribe human events to God's will -- as if humans have no responsibility for their own behavior.",1383177600,2,3216,4.815217391304348

485152,3,6302548748,"""Gettysburg; The Director's Cut"" has been around for a while. It was shown on TNT a number of times in the 1990's, but is just now being released on DVD and Blu-ray. I just finished watching-again-the theatrical cut. Some very fine performances, with actors being given big set pieces with excellent dialogue.

As I recall, the extended version contains a scene between General Lee and General A.P. Hill, who always wore a red shirt into battle, and be briefly seen in the theatrical version.

However, some of the re-enactors, especially on the Confederate side are just...too fat! Historical reality: given the condition of army rations, there were no fat soldiers on either side, except maybe for generals. The scene where Harrison the spy rides up to the Confederate picket line and is challenged by a fat Confederate soldier is just not historically believable. Plus, it sounds like that re-enactor was dubbed by a professional actor.

Because ""Gettysburg"" was originally intended for television (under the title...""The Killer Angels""), the final act of the movie is a bloodless Pickett's Charge. With no realistic depiction of what solid and exploding cannon balls do to the human body. Let alone what grape shot, canister and double canister do. Lots of smoke, cannon shots and rifle shots, but if the bloodiness of Pickett's Charge were accurately depicted, the theatrical release would have been rated NC-17, the kiss of death for advertising and exhibition. So the movie has a bloodless PG-13 Pickett's Charge.

Historical accounts of Pickett's Charge describe heads, arms, legs and torsos flying out of the clouds of black powder smoke and into the air, and whole lines of Confederate infantry mowed down, from grape shot, and especially canister. As another review on this page says, ""Gettysburg"" definitely does not have the battlefield realism of ""Saving Private Ryan"".

Rumor has it that when the film was screened in Atlanta for all the Turner Broadcasting  employees, the audience cheered when Ted Turner, in his Confederate officer cameo, got shot and killed.",1379721600,,2077,5.166666666666667

485186,5,6302548748,"Amazingly this four hour plus film (although intended as a TV mini-series) was released theatrically by Ted Turner and did fairly well; earning 10M toward its 25M production costs. But it has become one of the most popular films on cable TV and in VHS and DVD format, more than earning its keep. This adaptation of Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"" along with the adaptation of Jeff Shaara's prequel, ""Gods and Generals"", are in my opinion the two best theatrical films on the Civil War...especially true if you're a history buff. While Michael Shaara's account of Gettysburg is fictionalized, it is really only the dialogue that is fictional...the account in the book of the three day battle (and in this film) is accurate in all its salient points. Col John Buford (Sam Elliot) did hold the Federal line during the first day of battle; Col Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) did hold the Union left flank on the second day and did use the ""wheel maneuver"" to defeat the Confederate attackers. The famous Confederate cavalry general, J. E. B. Stuart, was a no-show, leaving Lee (Martin Sheen) strategically blind. Lt Gen James ""Pete"" Longstreet (Tom Berenger) did strongly recommend a flanking maneuver to get between Union forces and Washington and was strongly against the third day's battle, that came to be known as ""Pickett's Charge"". The Confederate general, Lewis ""Lo"" Armistead (Richard Jordan) and the Union general, Winfield Scot Hancock (Brian Mallon) were close friends. The acting by the entire cast is uniformly good, but the performances by Berenger, Daniels, Elliot, and Richard Jordan stand out. This was Jordan's last film as he died of a brain tumor before it was released.

485216,2,6302548748,"I write this as a cautionary tale.  The film could have been fine, and it did have some magnificent performances.  Particularly Pickett's but also Hancock's characterizations were strong and helped me see into the characters of people who might have fought in this war.

There is beautiful scenery, a sense of the countryside.  The circumstances around the battle are replayed in minute detail.  There is a reverence for the gravitas of the situation, just in terms of the effort, the scope.  I do enjoy watching this film, being a bit of a Civil War buff .

On the other hand, there were some serious, unnecessary mistakes made by the director, which detracted from the effort, and make it hard for me to watch without a sense of embarrasment, for myself as well as for him.

The Music. Is dreadful.  Generally speaking, and despite a few interesting themes in the quieter moments, the music is a poor production, conception, and execution.  Overwrought 1980s synthesizer, cymbals, very repetitive, laborsome, loud themes, just at those times when the grandeur of war is supposed to be upon us.  And instead of grandeur, what is upon us are ...

The extras. The director seems to have stocked the film with overfed Civil War recreators in clean clothes.  Hundreds of men, fat, mute and expressionless men, suck the life out of the production.  How can so many soldiers in so many fields of battle be silent, and clean, and jaunty?

This kind of mistake is repeated throughout the film: the belief that showing some realistic things will make the film seem real.  Farcically crude fake beards.  I saw a scene of man 'falling' from a boulder, which is so poorly shot, you can see him jumping.  Why not just show the net?  Others have commented on fake beards, so cheaply applied.  There's a point below which a feature film shouldn't try to go.

One of those southern generals, back in the day, is famous for having marched a corps in circles, so that they would appear as a large army to Northern observers.  Maybe the director should have lifted that page from history, because I tire of watching small bands of 50 men making over the countryside in complete isolation.  Better to not try to show a corps at all.

Someone else pointed out that the screenplay oddly substitutes flat dialogue for better examples that are known from history, case in point: Lee's rebuke of Jeb Stuart: 'an impediment to me now.'

I could give more examples, but this review would run the risk of rambling, and there's been enough of that already.

So ... it's a film that should have been better, but nevertheless it's a film that has some good acting and, for me, a fascinating subject, so I ... bring myself to watch as much of it as I can.",1378080000,3,2724,4.6582809224318655

Definitely take out the ""pep rally""'before Pickett's Charge where troops swarm around General Lee. Though its an emotional scene, it would not have accursed and it did not occur.

Also, the story of John Buford's stand the first day was great, I'm glad that they covered what a lot of books and movies glossed over. If Buford wouldn't have held, it could have spelled disaster for the Union. So the story doesn't need a lot of dialogue to reflect the feelings of the participants. But for some reason, the director chose an almost 2:1 ratio of dialogue to action. And some of it is totally gratuitous, like the exchange between Chamberlin's brother and the rebel soldier. By 1863 it was pretty clear to everyone what the motivations were for each side, there would simply be no need for such an exchange.

485323,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is sort of a minor miracle, especially after comparing it with its snooze-fest prequel ""Gods and Generals"". this was a monumental undertaking, originally filmed as a TV miniseries, but released to theaters. The director and Ted Turner deserve kudos for bringing this story to fruition. A dedication to historical accuracy and use of actual locations, whenever possible, coupled with superb performances and a compelling script, keep your attention throughout its epic length. Sincere, hearfelt performances are the center of the film, and one comes to see the combatants as human beings, rather than distant historical figures.

One minor quibble is the portrayal of Lee (well played by Martin Sheen) as the sole reason for the South's failure to win the battle. Almost nothing is made of Longstreet's failures on July 2, save for a single line of dialog where Lee pointedly tells Longstreet he doesn't understand why the day's attacks were not coordinated. Longstreet got his troops into action nearly five hours late (for reasons still debated by historians) allowing the Federals to reinforce their line. But this side of the battle is not featured in ""Gettysburg"". Instead the July 2 footage focuses almost exclusively on Little Round Top and Devil's Den.

Throughout the film Longstreet is portrayed as the voice of reason, which he often was. But he deserves some blame for the defeat, because it was again his failure to get his men into position on July 3 that led Lee to scrap his original attack plan and drive on the Union center with Pickett's division. The film is accurate in depicting Longstreet's opposition to that charge, and to the whole battle in general.

If you are a history buff, this film is not to be missed. If you are a Civil War buff, hold out for the Director's Cut, featuring more background and detail.",1374537600,,1847,4.990259740259741
485324,4,6302548748,"Very good acting (to be expected from the strong cast).  Authentic location and thousands of re-enactors.  And a great story and battle staging.  Overall quite an effort and a good film.  I loved the scene of Lee with Pickett's troops before their battle.

I did not like the over-emphasis on Joshua Chamberlin... if you did not know better, you'd get the impression that Little Round Top was the main fighting on the 2nd day.  And then continuing the Chamberlin story on the third day when he was uninvolved.... I'm sure Jeff Daniels was happy but not history buffs.

I also wish they had less dramatic speeches and even less of the over-orchestrated, tear jerker, symphonic music and more about the life of the soldiers and of the music of the day.  I further wish the movie had explored (and defended) Robert E. Lee's thinking.... yes he rolled the dice and lost but he knew he had to deliver a knock out punch (the South was about to be cut in half by Grant's control of the Mississippi in a few days, the coast was blockaded, and unlike the North that had a fresh supply of soldiers immigrating from Ireland and other countries, the South was running out of men to fight).

Finally, the film could been much more realistic about the horrors of the injured and dying... the movie showed only a modest amount of blood, carnage, and agony, when in reality the battlefield and field hospitals were living hells.  However, I do appreciate that showing a realistic level of violence would have meant at least an R rating, and would also have spoiled the romanticized, heroic vision many have of this epic battle.",1374451200,,1611,4.640845070422535

Have seen this film many times and it always gets to me, particularly Pickett's Charge.  The movie was filmed on actual locations, something the park does not usually allow.  A few battles (the Peach Orchard, for example) are omitted but the story line flows.  If you get the chance to see a reenactment, do it.  Then watch the movie.

485361,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" was originally conceived as a mini-series for TNT, but Ted Turner liked it so much he made it a theatrical. The film could have benefited from some editing, but does a good job of covering some events during the three-day Battle of Gettysburg.  The leading roles are filled by Martin Sheen, excellent as Robert E. Lee; Tom Berenger as James Longstreet, Lee's most dependable corps commander; Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlin, colonel of a Maine regiment; and Stephen Lang as George Pickett.

Richard Jordan plays Confederate general Lew Armistead, who was fatally wounded in the battle. The scene was Jordan's last appearance on the screen. He died within a year of a brain tumor at the age of 56.

The film shows Lee's reluctance to fight at Gettysburg at all, but once the battle starts, Lee goes all in, culminating in the doomed Pickett's Charge. Many of the scenes are very well done.  The stand of Chamberlin's 20th Maine on Little Round Top, ending in a bayonet charge that finally routed the Confederates, is one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  When you see ranks of men blasting away at each other with .58-caliber muskets at a range of 20 or 30 yards, you cannot help but be impressed by the raw courage of the men on either side.

The filmmakers used hundreds, if not thousands, of Civil War re-enactors as extras, and this lends a certain verisimilitude to the movie; but in closeups, it is hard not to notice the number of men who are older and, shall we say, more well-upholstered then men in either army would have been in 1863.  Other than that, the great attention given by re-enactors to their clothing and equipment is a big plus.

TNT made several good historical movies back then (""Ironclads,"" ""Rough Riders"") but ""Gettysburg"" was the only once that enjoyed wide release.  It is a fitting tribute to ""The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here"" at Gettysburg 150 years ago.",1373241600,2,1929,4.751497005988024

485381,3,6302548748,"Having just returned from the spectacular re-enactment at Gettysburg for the 150th Anniversary of the battle, I decided to view again the 1993 film starring Martin Sheen as the  marble-on-monument version of General Lee.  I was as disappointed now as I was in 1993, and yearn for a retelling of this important tale.  It is especially interesting to look again at this work through the prism of Spielberg & Kushner's masterful ""Lincoln"", which shows how complex historical events can be rendered gripping, moving and uproariously funny (who can forget Tommy Lee Jones scene stealing performance as Pennsylvanian power broker Thaddeus Stevens).

""Gettysburg"" benefits from the contributions of thousands of re-enactors who gave tension and realism to the battle scenes.  But a film is not a re-enactment. It requires a script, and here the 1993 film groans under Ronald Maxwell's dutiful yet ponderous screenplay.

Based on Michael Shaara's terrific novel ""Killer Angels"", the 1993 film version focuses principally on the interaction between General Lee and his skeptical lieutenant General James Longstreet on Seminary Ridge launching Pickett's charge, and the heroics of a tiny band of Mainers led by Joshua Chamberlain (a solid Jeff Daniels) on Little Round Top.  Most other elements of the battle are subordinated to these parallel stories and most historical characters remain absent (Union General Meade barely appears in the film).  Having decided on this structure, Maxwell should have rigorously adhered to it.  Instead, we are given distracting, rambling scenes with British Colonel Freemantle, debates on Darwin among Pickett and his colleagues, references to General Ewell's failure to take Culp's Hill but no depictions of the fighting at Culp's Hill.  Lengthy speeches interrupt the action while characters presciently describe what is about to unfold - poor Sam Elliot as Union Cavalry commander John Buford and Tom Berenger as Confederate General Longstreet are forced to use this theatric artifice.  Jeff Daniels and his Irish sergeant debate democracy, aristocracy and liberty.  The actors are required to step to center stage and deliver windy Shakespearean soliloquies but without the emotion or iambic pentameter. Consquently, the film drags for four long hours.

Several performances stand out. Richard Jordan, who likely knew he was dying of a brain tumor and this would be his last film, is powerfully moving as one of Pickett's doomed brigadier generals.  Steven Lang, best known as the villainous colonel in ""Avatar"", gives energy and verve to the role of Pickett - his delight at receiving a critical role in the battle - his subsequent horror after the devastation of his division.  Jeff Daniels also breathes life into cumbersome dialogue among the men of the Maine regiment.

Most disappointing are Sheen and Berenger as Lee and Longstreet, but upon rewatching the film and knowing the skills of both actors, I realized it was the playwright and not the thespian who is to blame.  History must be made human to reveal the heroism.  The film has grandeur but little heart.

Kudos to the production for historical accuracy at every level, though they may have fetishized the facts at the expense of dramatic pacing. Still, the battle scenes provide a genuine sense of combat.

Finally, while true to the novel, the hagiography of the Southern commanders seems a little at odds with hard truths.  These men were trying to break the Union. They were attempting to preserve the institution of slavery.  Should we cheer them?

Having just watched several thousand re-enactors march in sweltering heat over several days to present numerous scenes from the battle to a riveted audience (also sweltering in the grandstands) there is little doubt the battle retains its fascination for the American public. Normally, I do not favor remakes, but this story deserves a retelling - perhaps more from the Union perspective.  When one stands before the monument of the First Minnesota regiment knowing it lost 82% of its men in a critical but suicidal charge, one realizes the importance of this story in the American consciousness. I wonder what Spielberg and Kushner could do with this material.  They certainly wouldn't lack for thousands of volunteers to serve as extras - just visit the re-enactment. Twenty years after the first film, the men are still raring for a fight.",1373155200,2,4391,5.220797720797721

And the follow-up novels penned by his son, Jeff, although not in the same pantheon as his father's book, are mandatory reading for any Civil War enthusiast.

""Lucky"" movies has scenes or dialog/acting that stick in the memory year after year. For me, ""Gettysburg"" is blessed with several memorable moments: 1) A defiant Martin Sheen's as General Lee (who referred to his Union adversaries as ""those people""), admonishing the truant Jeb Stuart (did he lose the battle for Lee?) with his curt dismissal of Stuart with ""we will not speak of this again"", but more potently, Lee giving Pickett (Stephen Lang) a new assignment for his division after the infamous charge when Pickett answers with a breaking heart ""General, I have no division"", and the look on Lee's  face at his belated realization of the horrible mistake he made.

Not to be forgotten are Jeff Daniels as Col. Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as the reluctant Longstreet, Sam Eliot's memorable turn as the calm and confident Buford, the touching performance of Richard Jordan as General Armistead that firmly anchors the film in an era of sentimental words and thoughts when men were not ashamed to weep at nostalogic songs or poetry, or lace paper valentines, or exchange coffee and tobacco with their enemies during the lulls between battles.

Sure it glosses over the very solid work of George Meade while glossing over the slovenly adminstrative and communication work of Bob Lee.

I will state that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
Now, where are my quibbles:

Two many foot soldiers (North and South) appear too well fed. Think about it: They are constantly walking, on the move. They are fed the bare minimum (especially the South) and yet I saw portly older men marching down the road. Weariness is not an option.

Too many clean-shaven men. How many opportunities come up that present water and shavers and time to the foot soldiers?

Far too many 50ish-looking men. Like most wars, only our young men are expendible (and I write that with sadness).

The officers' clothing (especially the South's_ are way too clean. Some look as if dry cleaning occurred that morning.

Some of the hats worn, especially by Berenger and Sam Elliott seem buffonish, exaggerated cowboy hats that would seem more at home Gilly's dance hall on a 1980s Saturday night.

I know, these seem like minor annoyances. But to a purist, they nag. You have to suspend belief with most movies but these quibbles make it harder to do.

Still, I'd recommend this movie.

And Jeff Daniel's speech to the Maine soldiers who didn't want to fight further, well, that is a speech to die for. Daniel's humbleness and earnestness almost left me in tears.",1369008000,,1333,4.760869565217392

485452,4,6302548748,"I don't think anyone who's seen this movie could give it a bad review. I will say up front I prefer the original release more than the directors cut. Its just seems to move a bit better. The directors cut is primarily more 'sweeping pans' with a lot more music. Nice, but it does slow the movie down.
There are only a couple of things of issue.
ONE. All of us must remember that this movie is based on the book ""Killer Angels"". An extremely well researched book based on many facts available about the Gettysburg battle. BUT it is colored with a bit of the authors opinion when it comes to actual dialogue and individual emotions. There are conflicting opinions as to who decided what, who is at fault for this or that, even a bit of who actually was where. Some of the information provided (the writer admits) may be rose colored from biographies of some of the major players written long after the battle and slanted to place blame on others and laurels on themselves. More in depth historians may rip in with their opinions. They have a right to do so as long as they to admit personal feelings may also be a bit slanted.
TWO: The unfortunate fact that the battle was much larger than even this movie could accomplish displaying may be lost to some. I just ask everyone to remember that. There was fighting all along the Union line, and around the left flank. The main body (center) is portrayed and of course Chamberlains defense of the right flank. Heh, the movies long enough with just that. But I would have loved to see/hear more about Jeb Stewarts ride around the left side trying to get into the back of the Union defense. It was a very important part of the battle. The Union Cavalry (including General George A. Custer) did an excellent job of thwarting that attempt.
This movie has already become a staple for anyone who collects Civil War or just plain war movies. I had the original VHS boxed edition with the bullet in a bag.
If you already own it, blu-ray, dvd, vhs, whatever. This is the 150th anniversary edition of the battle.

Not exactly a stellar cast, or an over-the-top epic Hollywood production.  However, the cast does a great job in their roles and the ability to gain so many re-enactors and weapons of that time for the major battle scenes is very impressive.

Long on dialog of the machinations and relationships within the union and confederate headquarters and encampments in between battles helps to draw this film out at a bit of a slow pace.

All told, this remains one of the top films made in regards to the American Civil War.",1367193600,,706,4.715447154471545

Yet set in amongst the story of the battle the relationship of the two Chamberlain brothers is well played. I found, anyone not aware of what happened would wonder at the scene between the characters of Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart.

485483,4,6302548748,"The film only decribes a few of the battles that took place ine Gettysburg over the 3 days.  So this is not a full accounting.  Having just visited Gettysburg National Park, the battles and carnage are still difficult to imagine, and the film only partly explores this.  It's also got a dramatic flair and, I think, General RE Lee (Martin Sheen) seems a little too pie-in-the-sky Southern idealist to be perceived as a great tactican and important General.  All that said, the movie is one of the best depictions of the Civil War.",1367020800,,530,4.666666666666667

The battle sequences are the best moments in the film:  The recreation of Chamberlain's right wheel down Little Round Top is thrilling, as is the recreation of the opening moments of Pickett's charge.  The film comes up short however as a dramatic offering.  All of the characters are too stiff and wooden (Lee especially), and the ""dramatic tension"" between Gen'ls Armistead and Hancock is laughable.  And then there are the fake beards, which are abundant, and seem to get worse as the film trudges on.  The most egregious can be seen on Jeb Stewart, as the false facial hair appears to be connected directly to his ears.  It's good entertainment, but one can only wish Spielberg had stepped up to the task.",1366761600,,857,4.7114093959731544

If you are thinking of watching this movie, you have to reset your expectations and forget about seeing a good movie in any conventional sense. The acting is stiff, the production values are middling at best, the dialogue often clumsy (and sometimes laughably so). There is little in the way of dramatic tension, pacing, or artistry in the direction and editing. Martin Sheen is a dud as Robert E. Lee.  I don't know what Robert E. Lee was really like, but I wasn't buying what Martin was selling.  And the movie is excrutiatingly long and slow. But I watched it before visiting Gettysburg and found it pretty educational.

One could argue that more time and understanding are afforded the confederate characters. Notwithstanding that the moral high ground is given to the north's Joshua Chamberlain, southern apologists are free to criticize him as sanctimonious.

485596,2,6302548748,"""Gods and Generals"" was produced after ""Gettysburgh"", yet depicts events that occurred historically before the events in ""Gettysburg"".  ""Gods and Generals"", despite the critics, did a fine job of interweaving character development with complex historical-battle timelines.  You CARED for the characters.  One of the finest moments is when Stonewall Jackson, superbly cast and played by Stephen Lang, breaks down at the news that a child he befriended died.  No words--just presence.  Another superbly cast role in ""Gods and Generals"" is Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee.

Juxtapose just these two roles from ""Gods and Generals"" with ""Gettysburgh"":  Stephen Lang appears in ""Gettyburgh""--but as a different character!  And Martin Sheen plays Lee.  Martin Sheen is a fine actor, but a convincing general not is he.  Sheen is a pretty boy, not a man.  Sheen got away with his soft demeanor in ""Apocalypse Now"" because the story occurred during the Vietnam ""War""--a time when manhood was looked upon as a negative and aggression in battle as politically incorrect (it still is to this day).  But the Civil War era had no such pretenses.  Men were men, as Archie Bunker swined out, and the women loved them for it.  And  yet Duvall renders a General Lee that is sensitive, thoughtful and moral, as well as firm and authoritative.  This is something that Sheen can not deliver.

And these form a microcosm of what went wrong with ""Gettysburgh"".  Anyone who casts Sheen as General Lee fails to grasp the story that is Gettyburg.  Sadly, an epic story wasted on poor writing and casting.",1359936000,4,1577,5.019305019305019

General Lewis Armistead) perhaps steals the show with two remarkably emotional scenes.  Frankly, I thought Martin Sheen was miscast as General Lee.  He does not portray the dignity and stately bearing of General Lee that I read about in Shaara's book.  I cannot help but think how much better Robert Duvall would have been in the same role (Duvall played a dignified Lee in ""Lincoln"").  This aside, the movie accurately portrays the Battle of Gettysburg, the most important battle of the Civil War, as it was a costly defeat for the South.

I truly enjoyed the director's effort to make the movie historically accurate.  The production spared no expense in creating the sets, depicting the uniforms, the implements of war, and the battles themselves.  This makes the viewer feel as though he is watching an actual historical event take place. (I did see a jet contrail in one scene however!).

One criticism I have involves the music that plays during the war scenes. Rather than make the brutal close-up killing more realistic with the actual death cries of the wounded and dying, (like the opening scene in ""Private Ryan"") the gallant, heroic, and emotionally moving music overrides the scenes to such an extent that I quickly tired of it.  Men killing other men with cannon balls, musket balls, and bayonets is not heroic or inspiring in my view.  War is the bloody and brutal slaying of men, and I believe this particular music detracts from the horrific reality of war. There were over 50,000 casualties at Gettysburg.  This appalling number of dead and wounded occurred in just 3 days of battle.  While the musical score certainly enhances any movie, I believe it is misapplied to the movie's detriment in war scenes.

This is certainly a 5-star movie.  It will not appeal to everyone, but to those with an interest in American history, this is a movie they will want to see.  I also heartily recommend the book previously mentioned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/0307932885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>, for a more complete understanding of the war and specifically, Gettysburg.

Tom Berenger and Jeff Daniels give two of the most incredible performances I have seen on film.  The ""extras"" are actually civil war reenactors who went to Gettysburg and camped on the battlefield (with permission) to make this film.  When Martin Sheen needed to check a pocket watch on film, the producers just got one from the extras, knowing that it would be period-accurate!

It's long.  Running time is about 3 hours 30 minutes, but it is worth it!  The film covers the three days of battle and the two days on either side, so it covers the set up and the aftermath.  Finally, this is the last film performance by Richard Jordan (he portrays Gen. Armistead, the man who physically led ""Pickett's Charge""), and his performance is simply amazing.

The film's authentic feel and true emotional performances rise above any of the minor historical problems.

Rather long (4 hours 23 minutes), it may prove a bit tedious for the casual viewer.  However, for someone who has studied the Civil War or is merely curious as to  why these three days of fighting are considered by most historians to have been the turning point in the war,  it will prove time well spent.

The main characters are portrayed by seasoned, popular actors: Martin Sheen (Lee), Tom Berringer (Longstreet), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain), just to name a few.

485766,4,6302548748,"Gettysburg.

Bought for the husband, thoroughly enjoyed by myself as well.

The acting, sets, costumes and dialogue were all superb. Makeup was almost flawless.

The battle was a turning point in American History, it really came down, as depicted in the movie, to a personal decision by one Union officer on the run up to battle. I learned a great many things by watching this movie, things I later learned were accurate [for the most part] but were never taught in school.

Although largely a documentary of the battle and it's immediate background/aftermath it's not filmed documentary style, but perhaps done in that best fashion where it tells a very important story as a movie but still leaves the individuals recreated in it as a vivid memory for the viewer. They become again the real people that we can relate to and understand that they may well have been in life.
All tribute to the screenwriters, producers and directors for carrying off this very difficult task so well.

I personally found it to be a long movie, but did it in two sittings, and still found I may re-watch it to get a better insight to these events.

It would be an ideal film to sit and watch with any kids who are working through this period of American History in school.

It already has almost 600 Amazon reviews and a lot of them can only be termed excellent. Read some of the highly-rated reviews. They're very worthwhile. Personally, I thought it was a very fine film. I'm glad I watched it. The production values were high and the acting was good. It gave me a real feeling for the Civil War and the military battles of that time. It was a long film, but well worth the sitting.

I've always wondered how the casualty rates on some of these wars of the past could be so astronomical. After watching these fine reenactments, now I understand. It's a long, long way from modern smart bombs, drones and things of that sort. These battles were more like very serious life-and-death brawls. The depiction was excellent. It was bloody and brutal without being sensationalistic. Likewise, the tedium of war came across well. The 20-mile hikes per day and the day after day grind was well presented. It was a very good, very educational movie. It's just one of those movies that all Americans should watch.

485773,4,6302548748,"then you will love this extended version of Gettysburg.  Of course, it is very long - intended as a sweeping epic.  Jeff Daniels is thoroughly excellent as Joshua Chamberlain (which he plays in an understated and respectful manner), and Tom Berenger is adequate as confederate General Longstreet (the accent comes and goes arbitrarily), but I would have liked to have seen Robert Duvall return from Gods and Generals as Robert E. Lee instead of Martin Sheen. Duvall played the part with more gravitas and solemn dignity. Stephen Lang returns as George Pickett after portraying Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals, which felt somewhat strange. Fortunately, Lang is an excellent actor who clearly did many hours of actual character research.

Overall, the story narrative follows many details of the battle of Gettysburg correctly, and many spoken lines are taken directly from historical accounts.  It is, of course, possible to quibble with which parts of Gettysburg are shown and which are omitted, but to include all would have necessitated additional hours to an already extended movie.  However, because the battle fought on Little Round Top and the exploits of the 20th Maine are the main thrust of the movie storyline, the only real narrative choice I would venture to take exception to is the complete failure to include the monumental gaffe of Dan Sickles that cost the union many thousands of casualties and the led to the decimation of the 20th Maine.

The Wheat Field is only mentioned cursorily, and the epic speech of Father Corby to the Irish brigade is given a fleeting glimpse. The Northern end of the battlefield is entirely ignored after the events of the first day. But again, realizing that the movie must have a reasonable time frame, these omissions are understandable.  There are lots of small details that history lovers will recognize, such as General Pickett rushing out to observe the fighting from the red farmhouse in the middle of the battlefield, and the narrative of the close friendship between Generals Armistead and Hancock.

485775,1,6302548748,"I became a fan of Jeff Daniels after his depiction of Chamberlain of the Maine 20th on Little Round Top; those were the strongest scenes (and they better be!) But the rest - I fast-forwarded through an hour and a half of speeches. Who could write this stuff? Or believe that tough-as-nails soldiers from that era would even speak such sentimental drivel? It comes down to a poorly written screenplay focused way too much on myth instead of insight. You end up with a movie that tells instead of shows. Cinema is always better, to paraphrase a Steve McQueen adage, when actors use their their facial muscles more than their vocal cords. Actors know what to do - with proper lines. The raw material was there but the mine was never dug. Maybe the scale was too large for the crucial details to emerge, but if you're going to take on Gettysburg, you better bring it.
I appreciate the volunteers' efforts, but many fill out their uniforms a bit much, an impossibility for the rebels after two years in the field fighting and evading the Union Army. Those guys should have been rangy sons of guns. A volunteer cast of thousands explains but does not excuse. At least some Confederates are shown marching shoeless.
Another detail: when Gettysburg's cannons fire they don't recoil backward. I noticed in Gods and Generals that the same director got around to correcting this. If there's no recoil (rifles included), then you're obviously firing blanks, a point I realize that's not appreciated by many, at least not consciously. If you're trying to create an impression of shooting to kill, then fool us into believing that something's coming out the barrel, especially with big guns.
I have come to the conclusion that the predominantly positive reviews of the film reflect the political split in this country. Many people prefer idealized (and insulting to the men who died) depictions maintaining an iconography of American history, instead of gritty portrayals of flawed humans that inspire and vicariously inform.

The Blu-ray definitely has a sharper image than the DVD. However, it also has a darker image. Thus some of the extras in the background--and even at times, a few of the faces of the actors in the foreground--that you would see on the DVD are little more than shadows on the Blu-ray. I thought about giving the Blu-ray only a 4-star rating for that reason. However, the darker image is far more realistic and dramatic.

The description on Amazon about the product does not specially say that the Blu-ray is an extended version. However, there are a number of scenes from the movie on the Blu-ray that were not on the DVD.

The description on Amazon says the Blu-ray is a 2-disc edition (as the DVD was). However, the Blu-ray is a 1-disc edition.

I played my DVD copy of Gettysburg for comparison to make sure, but there is no doubt this disc is much too dark, especially the part just before Pickett's charge and through to the end.
It's a shame, because even though the extension only amounts to less than 20 minutes of new material, every bit of added scene and dialogue is a gem.
More character development of Iron Brigade commander Reynolds with Buford, and of Robert E. Lee, wherein Lee is more thoughtful and intelligent than in the other scenes where Sheen portrays him as some kind of hippie general who took one too many bad trips in his youth. That always bothered me about the original, but I can tolerate Sheen's performance a little better now.
Alot of the new scenes fill in spaces and serve to tie up loose ends and help the story flow better. It makes for a much better movie.

This is opposed to the extra scenes in the extended version of Gods and Generals, which are nice, and I like my epics long, but they really don't add much to the film.

I'm a bit of a Civil War buff (don't have my own uniforms), but know enough to be dangerous.

Gettysburg is a really good movie.  It may or may not be perfect history, but it's primarily entertainment.  And it's really good at that.

Tom Berenger is wonderful as Longstreet.  Jeff Daniels - this is probably my favorite performance of his ever.  Sam Elliott devours ever scene he is in.  Martin Sheen as Lee is interesting.  I don't like the casting, but I love his acting in the role.

The battle scenes are first rate.  My real only complaint is on the beards.  Some of them are just atrocious.

The old Battle of Gettysburg special feature is cute, voiced by Leslie Nielsen.  The Making of Gettysburg is a nice look at the making of the movie.  Watch Martin Sheen fight against his Virginia accent, then just give in and stay in character the whole time.  I didn't know Ted Turner was in the movie, but if I had financed it, I would have played dress up also.  The making of documentary is also great for the respect shown to the battlefield.

485801,5,6302548748,"GETTYSBURG was filmed on location at the National Battlefield site. Thousands of passionate re-enactors help make this partial recreation of the pivotal Civil War battle a rousing experience for viewers. Points off for fakey-looking facial hair (Tom Berenger's beard is almost laughable) and some altering of facts for dramatic purposes, yet for feeling a part of a momentous clash of arms, this film tops them all.

Martin Sheen portrays Confederate commander Robert E. Lee as philosophic, reverent, stubborn and devoted to his men, but with a volatile temper when crossed. (It is how I've always pictured him.)

Jeff Daniels not only looks like the 20th Maine's Col. Chamberlain, he is very convincing as a college professor of conviction who went off to war, ""because it was the right thing to do.""

Watching Sam Elliott's emotive cavalry general John Buford, the first Union commander engaged, and against vastly superior numbers, is like wolfing down a second helping of very salty ham. He and his successful stand leave one thirsty.

Richard Jordan's emotional displays as Confederate general ""Lo"" Armistead are all the more touching, as the actor knew he was dying and this would be his last film.

Stephen Lang delights as Gen. Pickett during a campfire argument over Charles Darwin and just who is ""descended from uh ape."" This playful banter makes so much more stark his bitter remorse after an open field ""Charge"" that Lee orders Pickett to attempt on Day 3 fails, and his division is decimated by Yankees safely entrenched behind Cemetery Hill's stone wall.

With the crippling of Gen. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia ultimately went the hopes of the South to prevail in a long, hard-fought war. The Confederacy's supply of men and armaments were nearly exhausted. Lee was never again able to fight an offensive campaign.

Happily this film not only has these details within the film (e.g. about Little Roundtop), but also extras to fill in the details. Even if you aren't a history buff or an American, this film is still worth watching.

But is it worth 4 hours?
Just about. There are a few too many dialogue scenes and it seems from other reviews that I'm not alone in fast-forwarding some of these.
Ultimately though, some films define and do full justice to their material and the fact that no one has sought to trump this film means it must be the definitive version.

485816,2,6302548748,"Many have commented on the historical accuracy of this film.  While the timing of these events themselves may be accurate, i.e., the first days fight, Little Round Top, and Longstreet's Assault (what most call ""Pickett's Charge), the accuracy of the actual battle sequences leaves much to be desired.  For example, in one scene, Lee is seen riding with several staff members and subordinates and says, ""To all commanders attack.""  This would have taken place during the very late morning or just after noon.  The next scene shows the death of Union General John Reynolds.  Reynolds was shot very early in the mornings fight, long before Rodes' division arrived on the field and the afternoon attacks occured.  Later, Tom Chamberlain is talking with some Confederate prisoners.  First the prisoner says he's from Tennessee, Archer's brigade.  He then says he was captured in the Railroad Cut.  Anyone with even a minimal knowledge of the battle knows it was Joe Davis's Mississippians who were engaged in the RR Cut, Archer's Tennesseans were on the south side of the Chambersberg Pike in McPherson's Woods fighting the Iron Brigade.  And one last inaccuracy I will point out (although there are many others) is Chamberlain and the 20th Maine.  Did they fight valiantly? Yes! Did they save the Union army?  Alone, definately NO!!  They had a large part, but much other valiant fighting occured on Little Round Top.  Also, the famous bayonet charge is way overblown.  Col. William Oates stated he was on the verge of pulling back after 3 hard charges up the hill.  The Alabamians were not making another charge up the hill when the 20th charged down the hill.  Chamberlain led the 20th gallantly, and was an important part of the defense, but other commanders knew how to ""refuse the line"" and order ""counter charges""; it was pretty basic tactics and any good colonel would have done the same.

I enjoy the movie as a Civil War movie and love watching it for entertainment.  However, if it's historical accuracy you want, there are many excellent books out there to read.  For history read ""Gettysburg: The First Day""; ""Gettysburg: The Second Day""; ""Gettysburg: Culp's Hill and Cemetary Hill"", all by Harry Pfanz.  ""Picketts Charge"" by George Stewart is excellent and the reason Pfanz never bothered covering the subject.  And finally, the entire battle is covered very well in books by Stephen Sears and Noah Andre Trudeau.  For Little Round Top see, ""Stand Firm Ye Boys from Maine"" by Thomas Desjardin for the 20th Maines action, and/or ""Twilight at Little Round Top"" by Glenn W. LaFantasie for the entire action on Little Round Top.

I am open to comments if I am wrong on these observations, but the extensive reading I've done and battlefield tours with Licensed Battlefield Guides (3 hours at Little Round Top) form the basis of observations.

The battle scenes are excellent and without the other top blood and gore one expects to see in modern war movies.  The movie does an excellent job capturing the emoition and choas of combat.  The scenes involving the lead up to and the acutual Picket's Charge are worth the cost alone.

485819,4,6302548748,"First of,
I bought my Gettysburg blu-ray from amazon germany,used as new,for just over 11,much cheaper than elsewhere,HOWEVER,it was the normal,rather than digibook,packaging which,although ""nice"",isn,t in the same league as the,far more expensive,digibook. The digibook is very classy,IMO.
Now,to the film itself,I aint gonna write a review of the actual film,the ""name"" speaks for itself,you Guys from America have forgotten more than I know about Gettysburg, the American Civil War too,so I aint gonna ""insult"" you by even having the slightest discussion about this subject,what I will say is,Gettysburg/American Civil War is a fascinating subject for me,and that,s how I found this film,FASCINATING!!!!
The blu-ray transfer is very,VERY good,imo,far better than the dvd,many scenes are beautiful to look at,there are the odd grainy scenes,but the blu-ray knocks the dvd to smithereens for picture quality!!!! I thought the audio could have been better,but that,s maybe a wee bit nitpicking on my part.
I think the film hinges on two roles,Longstreet and Chamberlain,and both are played excellently by Tom Berenger and,especially,Jeff Daniels. The bayonet charge down Little Roundtop by Chamberlain is quite inspirational,especially for an ""outsider"" like me,and I think Berenger caught Longstreet,s ""dillemma"" perfectly,""how can you disagree with Robert E. Lee""??????? and History proves Longstreet was correct,and Lee wrong,maybe Lee,s only mistake,but what a time to make that ""mistake""!!!!IMO.
Gettysburg blu-ray is a MUST-BUY for anybody interested in the American Civil War,and it stands on it,s own as a very good ""war movie"" too.
A wee final observation about the packaging,America and Great Britain are ""lucky"",we don't have the age certificate placed on the front covers as Germany does,in my opinion this totally spoils many a beautiful cover,Gettysburg included,and it,s completely unnecessary!!!! put the age certificate on the BACK cover,the Gettysburg Blu-ray Digibook is a beautiful cover,perfect for any collection.

485820,5,6302548748,"Gettysburg is indeed a war movie, but it is much, much more than a typical war movie.  Indeed, it is my very favorite movie, and I feel inexplicably drawn to the profound emotional pilgrimage of seeing it again every few years.  I relate to it on many levels, and I think you may too...

As a student of history, I am fascinated by how this one battle decided not only the fate of America, but had a huge impact on world history.  Can you imagine how very different Europe might be today if there were no undivided United States to come and help in WWI, WWII, or the Cold War?

As a fallible human, I am still astounded at how a relatively small error or two coupled with pride probably meant the difference in the battle, and hence world history.

As a moviegoer, I deeply appreciate how the movie maker was very careful for the details.  As those civil war buffs in the audience know, this is sacred ground, and I appreciate the care given to it by the movie makers.  Indeed, the movie used over 4000 civil war re-enacters as extras.

As a friend to others, I am deeply moved at how a trio of officers, close friends in the US Army for many years, all were drawn into this battle; when its effects were over, two would be dead and the third wounded.  And on the night before the climactic battle, two of them know the next day their units will be facing each other in battle, and are agonizing over it. Even after seeing it 6-7 times, I still cannot help but weep when one of the friends cries out to God for the fate of this trio near the end of the movie.

As a veteran, when a brave officer whose unit is out of ammunition orders a desperate charge, I shudder uncontrollably, and my only thought is ""He did his duty.""  I am also fascinated by the variety of reasons the soldiers on both sides had for fighting in the war, which the movie wonderfully articulates.

As a citizen, I am very conflicted.  I am thankful that the union was preserved and slavery abolished.  But I shudder at how states rights were weakened; indeed, for decades now in my opinion the Tenth Amendment has been virtually ignored.

As a Christian, I find it fascinating and thought-provoking  how more overtly Christian officers and soldiers on both sides were, and am intrigued by Col. Chamberlain, a devout Christian.

As a student of culture and society, I am fascinated at the differences between southern and northern cultures and societies which are clearly depicted throughout the movie.  As a British military attach so aptly observes, ""Same land.  Same god.  Different dreams.  Very different dreams.""",1311292800,4,2588,4.520430107526882

Unlike so many other Civil War films, all the main characters in this film were real historical people.  All the events were real historical events.

God's and Generals was the second film made, arising out of the first book of the series by Shaara.  It too was excellent.

It's not quite as visceral (blood and gutsy) as the recent History Channel special, but I guess I liked that it had its more quiet, thoughtful moments too. It is considerably long, at about 4 hours, and it has many more hours of excellent extra features, including maps, a ""making of"" doc and a commentary track with the director, writer, cinematographer and historians. I actually spent most of a whole weekend watching it all. There is a lot to learn and enjoy.

The cast is uniformly outstanding, especially Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliott and the too-early departed Richard Jordan. Martin Sheen seemed a bit short and pudgy for Gen. Lee, but he delivers a memorable characterization nonetheless.

Civil War buffs can probably find issues to argue with. The writer and filmmaker focus on very specific skirmishes on each of the three days of the widely diffuse battlefield, but I think they took a good, balanced approach that highlights certain themes and tactics.

Yes, the picture is sharper and with more detail and vibrant colors, but the problem is gamma (dynamic range from light to dark). The picture is contrasty (no shadow detail-actors faces obscured under brims of hats) and murky in other parts. Who engineered this and authorized its release? I watched the same scenes from the DVD and the picture quality is far superior (except for fine detail and sound).

Sheen looked like a circus clown scuffling around in a baggy uniform that didn't fit.  Lee's appearance in most photos is tall and regal.
The beautifil 19th century language is murdered, and the theatrics during battle, via Hollywood, didn't match any real time accounts I have read.

485853,5,6302548748,"As a child of the 1990s, I first encountered ""Gettysburg"" during one of its myriad screenings on the TNT cable network. I immediately connected with the film, a connection which has germinated into, if not obsession, certainly a keen interest in this period in our nation's history. Slavery, independence, invasion, politics, economics, brother against brother -- all ingredients for a potent and portentous conflict, and especially for great drama. I've also read Michael Shaara's great, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>&nbsp;from which this film was adapted, and it is certainly worth your time and makes an excellent companion to the film.

The film's strengths are its focus, length, and authenticity. By concentrating on a single conflict -- the pivotal battle at Gettysburg -- author Shaara and filmmaker Maxwell are able to delve into the psyche of their three leads, Confederate Generals Lee and Longstreet and Union Colonel Chamberlain, and paint an impression for the audience as to how and why these men were locked in such a long and bloody struggle. The level of character development is almost unheard of for a war epic, and a leisurely-yet-assured pace holds the viewer's attention for the duration of the film, which isn't the case with this film's companion prequel, ""Gods and Generals.""

As for this Blu-ray, I'm very pleased. The 271-minute extended cut of the film and commentary track is presented on the first Blu-ray disc while the documentaries, battlemaps, and trailer from the DVD release are housed on a second disc, also a DVD (and thus in standard definition). The digibook packaging is very attractive with vivid colors and the film's title is embossed; it's really quite striking. The 40-page booklet inside features cast and crew bios, as well as some commentary on the film and battle, along with a Civil War timeline. It's an excellent package.

The video presentation, while not reference quality, is quite good. Colors and fine detail are greatly improved over the DVD. There is significant film grain throughout, and, having never had the good fortune to view this in a theater, for the first time I really felt that the movie looked like a film. Watching this Blu-ray, you will wonder how you put up with that smeared DVD for so long. Audio is much the same; presented here in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, finally with a dedicated LFE channel for your subwoofer, so that cannonfire, gunshots, and Randy Edelman's stirring score all have far more oomph over previous incarnations.

All-in-all, if you own the DVD, this Blu-ray makes for an excellent and worthwhile upgrade. If you're new to the film, this is currently the best way to experience it. Very highly recommended.",1306454400,15,2860,5.363028953229398

The Director's Cut does include some additional footage not seen in the originial release.  For example, the exchange between Longstreet and Harrison midway through the movie is expanded.

The transfer to Blu-ray is definitely an improvment over the original DVD transfer, but there is some obvious grain visible in most shots, and the contrast/clarity isn't comparable to more modern releases.  I did feel that the audio track was a bit cleaner and the explosions had a bit more punch.

485857,4,6302548748,"At 4 hours and 14 minutes, GETTYSBURG ranks as one of the longest U.S.-made theatrical releases ever. I wasn't surprised at all to discover that GETTYSBURG started out as a proposed TV miniseries. It has a distinct ""made-for-TV"" feel to it. However, unlike other miniseries, GETTYSBURG spares virtually no expense in portraying the pivotal 1863 battle in Pennsylvania that (together with Vicksburg, fought at the same time some 2000 miles away) changed the course of the Civil War.

GETTYSBURG was based on Michael Shaara's outstanding Civil War novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>. Although GETTYSBURG was counted as a flop in its limited theatrical release, it has become a favorite in Home Video release, and a mainstay of schoolhouse lessons on the Civil War. Within its bounds, it is excellent.

One part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is the doing of Civil War buff Ted Turner who backed this project to the full, providing funds enough for meticulous detail. Another part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is provided by the hundreds of Civil War reenactors who populate the screen bringing their unpolished sincerity and love of history to the film. Yet another part of the film's excellence is provided by the National Park Service which allowed much of GETTYSBURG to be filmed on the battlefield itself. And yet again, the performances of the lead actors capture the sense of grandeur and tragedy that pervades the air at Gettysburg National Park to this day.

Of particular note are the performances of Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet, CSA and Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, USA. Chamberlain's valiant defense of Little Round Top on the second day of the battle denied Confederate forces the opportunity to flank Union lines and roll up General George Meade's army in a messy, bloody package.

In Berenger's and Daniel's performances it is crystal clear that both men, Longstreet and Chamberlain, profoundly feel the pathos of the war, that hideous sense of brothers fighting brothers, killing each other. Commanders on opposite sides were, or had been, personal friends, often roommates at West Point. The Union ranks included Southern soldiers from every State except South Carolina. The Confederate General Commanding, Robert E. Lee, had been offered command of the Union armies prior to the outset of war. The Civil War was nightmarish: Large bore, long range, low velocity late Nineteenth Century weapons technology met early Nineteenth Century Napoleonic field tactics that had men bunched in battle squares often face to face, making every battle a killing field; military medicine was all but nonexistent. Some 52,000 men died or were wounded in three days at Gettysburg, about half the total who fought. This almost matches the number of losses in Korea (53,000 in three years) and Vietnam (58,000 in ten years).

Does GETTYSBURG have weaknesses? A few. The theatrical beards worn by most of the men look too obvious (a minor point, but still noticeable). The onscreen battle is almost antiseptically free of gore (a legacy, no doubt, of the film's intended ""miniseries"" status) as opposed to the real battle, which was a charnel house personified. But by far it's biggest weakness is the casting of Martin Sheen (normally an excellent actor) as Robert E. Lee. In what is a small part, Sheen simply doesn't carry the role. He projects none of Lee's charisma and none of Lee's inborn elegance, so evident even in photographs, Sheen's Lee comes across as truculent and unassured. I've read that Sheen was cast as Lee only a day or two before production began, and that Sheen knew virtually nothing about Lee or the Civil War at that time; so perhaps his ""generic General"" is forgivable, or would be, were Robert E. Lee not such a central personage in Civil War history.

485859,5,6302548748,"A VERY faithful retelling of both the novel & the historical event! In my opinion the only thing missing would have been to show General Ewell's failure to press the attack at the end of the day on July 1st.  Lee wanted him to take Cemetery Ridge once Buford & Reynolds' troops were in retreat and Ewell was far too tentative and failed to do so.  I would argue that was the single most critical event that lead to disaster for Lee's army.  I would disagree with the reviews that criticize Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee.  Lee tended to be a somewhat melancholy temperament who, while a brilliant tactician, benefitted enormously from the aggressiveness of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  Since Gettysburg was the first major engagement after Jackson's death just two months earlier and who, Gen. Lee described as his 'right arm', was a bit more tentative than he might ordinarily be.  Additionally, I would argue that was compounded by his instructions to General Longstreet to remain behind and not personally oversee forward areas of the battlefield which was his habit.  I would say that, chronologically, Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lee in Gods & Generals was more accurate for THAT moment in time and that Sheen's portrayal reflected a changed man, a bit more tentative after losing his best battlefield commander 51 days earlier.  Other than a small quibble over which details were included, the movie is well-acted, and develops the battle and events exceedingly well.  It is also enhanced with an excellent score! The only requirement is that you have the stamina and attention span to follow the account for the 4+ hours of running time.  Fantastic for the Civil War buff or military history or war drama fan. Excellent for those who are curious enough to sit through it. Since this single battle is perhaps the most crucial event in American history successive to the completion of the Constitution in regards to shaping what the United States was and would become, it deserves the attention of anyone who wants to understand the men and events of those fateful days.",1304294400,3,2085,4.914529914529915

The same scene is used over and over again. We filmed that for days and all they used was the same scene over and over. Poor editing at best, ignorance at worst. A good movie that could have been a great movie in a more competant director's hands. Can you imagine this done by a class act like Steven Speilberg? If the level of realism displayed in ""Saving Private Ryan"" had been achieved in ""Gettysberg"" it would be a modern masterpiece.

The movie has done an excellent job of showing the scope of the action while allowing us to come to know a specific individual who played a critical part in the battle. His speech to some would-be deserters is worth watching even if the rest of the movie was just so-so. However, the rest of the movie is very well done, especially the part where Colonel Chambers orders a fix-bayonet charge, after running out of ammunition, in order to repel the last Confederate advance.",1301184000,3,658,4.681034482758621

485867,5,6302548748,"Unfortunately, Amazon explains little or nothing about the new Gettysburg Director's Cut blu-ray release. What exactly does `Director's Cut' mean here? These are the timings for the original theatrical release, the two previous digital releases, and the new blu-ray release, as listed at another site:

Gettysburg Original Theatrical Release - running time 3 hrs. 58 Minutes, plus a 20 Minute Intermission.
Gettysburg Laserdisc - running time 4 hrs., 29 min
Gettysburg DVD - running time 4 hrs., 14 minutes
Gettysburg Blu-Ray (2011 ""director's cut"") - running time 4 hrs., 31 minutes

Since the 17 minute difference between the DVD and the upcoming blu-ray release is almost exactly the same as the difference with the laserdisc release, I can only assume that the added 17 minutes will be the same as that found on the laserdisc. This included one crucial scene that for some absurd reason was included in neither the theatrical release nor the DVD release. In it, following the first day's conflict, Lee meets with his generals who were responsible for leading the first day's battles and gets an admission from them that they failed to take the crucial Cemetery Hill if not the entire Missionary Ridge heights when they were supposedly open for the taking. Thus we come to know from this scene that generals like Early and Ewell were actually at Gettysburg along with Longstreet and Pickett, and that that was the reason why Lee ordered Pickett to charge the ridge on the third day. Also included in the laserdisc was a scene when Union cavalry general Buford enters Gettysburg on the first day before moving thru the town and engaging Lee's advance division west of town. He is met by several townspeople, including an officious mayor of the town who demands protection. To my recollection - I gave up my laserdisc version several years ago when my player self-destructed - this about takes up most if not all of the 17 additional minutes. The rest of the DVD release seemed to match the laserdisc release fully.

Leaving aside the inaccuracies and omissions (some historians, for example, hold that Ewell probably couldn't have taken Cemetery Hill that first day whether he'd actually tried or not, since by late afternoon his advancing forces had become bogged down for a considerable time in chasing the Union forces through Gettysburg itself, and there was already at least a fresh division of Union troops on the summit facing the town; and a great deal of the 2nd day fighting, including General Sickles and the Wheatfield are completely neglected, while Meade hardly appears at all), the movie especially in its depiction of the Little Round Top battle on the 2nd day, along with the two-day argument that arose between Longstreet and Lee re the efficacy of continuing to fight the battle at Gettysburg, is highly vivid and accurate. Randy Edelman's music is also exceptional, while Jeff Daniel's depiction of Joshua Chamberlain, Stephen Lang's of Pickett and Tom Berenger's of Longstreet are especially outstanding. While casting Martin Sheen as the courtly Lee was controversial, I for one found his performance also excellent. The other great `stars' of the movie, of course, are the re-enactors, along with the battery of cannons that so vividly mark the prelude to Pickett's charge. In both DTS sound and blu-ray, the battle scenes especially should reach an ultimate level of excitement. Highly looked forward to!

(Note: just a measure of what's happened to movie digital release prices in the past 25 years or so, I purchased the laserdisc version of the movie at $179.95 retail, in Orlando, Florida, sometime in the mid 1990's!)",1300579200,18,3648,5.024793388429752

485885,5,6302548748,"When I was a boy, there were still a sufficient number of Civil War Veterans to lead each Armistice Day parade although the bulk of  the Veterans, most still in their forties, were from the Great War. The War was a living memory partly for that reason but also because the crisis of The Great Depression had generated a need to revive heroic  American myths to reinforce commitment to the American Way as a set of values whose Truth was testified to by the blood spilled to create and preserve them. When last I checked, some decades ago, the estimates varied from 40,000 to 70,000, as the number of Civil War books which had been published. Whatever may be (the essentially unknowable) correct figure, the stream has not diminished. Not a Civil War buff, I have still managed to read new books by the noted British military historian, John Keegan, and by the distinguished American historian, Stephen Sears, who added Gettysburg to his works on the great battles of the war. The point is that few Americans to whom the Civil War still has significance can watch a film such as this without doing so through a conceptual framework which strongly influences what we see. Taking account of the impact on my own interpretive framework as I approach anything on that war,  I can only say that, despite the inevitable limitations and defects, this serious and sober effort to make the battle a moving experience, succeeded for me. No,it is not reality, but it is sufficiently suggestive for an American mind to use it as a springboard into the realities that cannot be shown.  For me, for example, hovering over the nightmarish suggestions of what it means for live men to confront real artillery and real hand held weapons (only a few had the new rapid firing rifles) was the thought of the tens of thousands of Union (and to a lesser extent, Confederate troops, who fought on the defensive) dead who bloodied the soil of Virginia as Grant took command and won in the only way possible, by paying for each step toward Richmond with union corpses and severed body parts.

485891,3,6302548748,"From a movie-making and entertainment perspective this is a pretty good flick, but the portrayals of the Confederates is just plain weak. Robert E. Lee is seen as indecisive and a bit frustrated with the lack of his commanders' abilities to provide him with any useful information about the Union positions while the Union commanders appear to be cool, calm and collected, well-trained and able to make snap decisions. In fact, this imagery is consistent from top to bottom on both sides. The Union troops are all dressed in the same blue uniform and all show that they received good training before embarking on maneuvers. Even the 'deserters' are well-mannered men who fight valiantly. The Confederates, on the other hand, look like a rag-tag assembly of untrained farm boys who know nothing of disciplined fighting. Historically speaking the Confederates wore gray uniforms, but in this movie they wear just about every color under the sun and look more like a mob than an army. I realize that the North won the war and '...to the victors go the spoils...' but this is carrying it a bit too far. In one particular battle scene in the woods at the top of a hill the Union troops are badly outnumbered and are hoping to just hold the South off to give their other units more time in some battles below, but...voila! Here come those hillbillies running up the hill straight into the muzzles of the Union rifles just itching to get shot. Instead of digging in and engaging the Union from a secure position those 'rebs' just kept on running into the spray of bullets and died in droves. After several repeated drives the Union soldiers ran out of ammunition and had to use bayonets. Bayonets against bullets usually means defeat...but not when you're up against F-Troop. The movie is fairly well made and entertaining, but if you're looking for a more factual re-enactment, watch The North and The South.",1283126400,,1902,4.801829268292683
485892,4,6302548748,"This movie provides a great overview of this famous three-day battle in Pennsylvania.  It is about the battle with only minor introductory material.  Jeff Daniels is fantastic in this film.  He made a moving speech to a small group of deserters about the reason to fight.  It may sound like an obligatory speech about the abolition of slavery but with Jeff Daniels, it comes of sincere and moving.  There were similar moments from the Confederate side about why they too thought the war was justified considering all they wanted to do was to quit the Union and be left alone with their own country.  If one is willing to set aside the moral issue of slavery (no one should), one could see why the south felt this way.  The film made sure in the begining and at the end that the audience could property recognize and identify the actors in character and the actual historic figures they represent.  It is a very nice touch.  The acting is good with the obvious exception of Martin Sheen playing General Robert E. Lee.  His Lee was wooden, insignificant and not at all the majestic and larger-than-life figure that history has come to recognize Lee.  His poorly done and high pitch southern accent is quite bothersome to the degree of being silly.  It is almost enough to ruin the film's realism.  The movie avoided the bloody carnage that historical accounts have left us.  In the film, the dead and dying are relatively clean cut.  A more modern movie would seek to be more realisitc in this area.  The battle scenes are nevertheless very impressive.  The difficult defence of the left flank of The Little Round Top by Colonel Chamberlain's men and the artillery exchange of the two sides just before the start of the Pickett's charge on the last day were both very fine battlefield scenes.  The scenes depicting the consecutive firing of the large guns just before the charge are very impressive.  The film does provide and excellent overview of the battle of Gettysburg.

If Ted Turner and group would hire the special effects groups that did say, the Lord of the Rings, and show Picket's charge as it was with the full number of soldiers participating crossing the field and being slaughtered as they truly were, with more realism, with bodies and parts stacking up as they came on, showing an unrelenting view of the battle as it was, and then adding to the film at the end, a small vignette of the reunion (as described in Ken Burns Civil War) where the surviving soldiers in reenacting the charge tearfully throw down their arms and rush out to hug each other, then this could possibly be the one of the best anti-war movies ever made.

485896,5,6302548748,"While GETTYSBURG has a few drawbacks--mainly the sprawling amount of time taken to depict the fierce Civil War battle with two viewpoints and philosophies--it compensates with its historical accuracies in depicting the battleground while at the same time compressing the three-day battle into the framework of a lengthy film.

Its major asset is the sincerity of all of the major performances--and that includes TOM BERENGER looking magnificently scruffy behind his impressive beard, MARTIN SHEEN as Robert E. Lee, STEPHEN LANG as George Pickett, JEFF DANIELS and C. THOMAS HOWELL as Union brothers, RICHARD JORDAN as Lewis Armistead and SAM ELLIOTT as John Buford.

Another fine asset is the stirring musical background with patriotic war themes and drum beating exercises adding flourish to the drama. The sets, costumes and color photography are all first rate, but some will be impatient with the talk between battles which is sometimes a little too extensive. All of the battle scenes look like a re-enactment, a soft core version of the more graphic horrors of war that are rampant in many more recent war films.

Still, it's an impressive film from start to finish and the performances are all admirable.

The most haunting exchange of dialog occurs at the end of the battle with Pickett being told by Robert E. Lee to keep an eye on his division.

Ted Turner set out to bring the book to the screen, and the best decisions were to invite thousands of Civil War re-enactors to be extras in the film, and to film on location at Gettysburg. Nothing like thousands of people passionate to get it right, especially when you put them at the site of the actual battle.

Jeff Daniels is excellent in his role, as is Richard Jordan. Tom Berenger does a very good job portraying General Longstreet. Unfortunately, this is probably Martin Sheen's worst acting ever. I'm sure Robert E. Lee rolled over in his grave every time Sheen appeared on screen.

Despite my criticism of some acting and the fact that it really doesn't do the book justice in explaining the Southern point of view regarding the war, this film delivers some really fine perspective on this pivotal battle.

Additionally, a Blu-ray release would eliminate the troublesome need to manually flip over the disc to see the remainder of the movie, since a Blu-ray disc would have more than sufficient capacity on the single side of a disc.

I thought the language was somewhat stilted, but then, I had to remember that was the way people talked ~150 years ago.

I'm only 1 hr into the movie, but am already learning a lot.  For example, I didn't realise all those impressive beards we see in ancient photographs were fake.  I assumed they were real, but I guess I missed the detail in the grainy pictures.

The only minuses so far, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the speeches the officers give (and there have been a couple of doosies) seem a bit too long and rehearsed for having happened on the spot, during a battle.  Also, the soldiers seem a bit too chipper, running past and kneeling next to dead bodies as if they weren't...  dead bodies.  I mean, if I had a dead body next to me, I'd be kinda bothered by it.

PS!  My friend insists the they grew real, natural beards back in the 1860s and that the beards in the movie are supposed to look real.  But there's no way that's possible.

Even though, in the four hours length of it, we are presented with only small samplings of what was a monumental three-day battle that continues to comprise more than any one human being can wholly comprehend in a lifetime, ""Gettysburg"" draws the viewer in to where s/he can't help but want to visit this place, walk these hills and fields, and read and learn more and more of what happened there, and how what happened there has continued to define who we are, even now, as a nation.

The colors are clear and sharp as is the movie itsself. The only thing that was wrong with this movie is the Disk itsself. Its two sided, which is fine, but not marked as side A and B, which I had to do. Other than that I urge people to purchase this movie, sit back and feel the hair raise on your arm's, and neck when the music sound track starts, right at the begining. Your heart starts beatting, you sit on the edge of your chair, and you may find yourself rooting the troops on, whichever side, Blue or Grey, you favor.

I was born in the South and I was exposed to all the idolatry of Lee. Unfortunately, there is a different R.E. Lee and I think Sheen and the director are trying to show him: Lee the religious man, Lee the Southern Fanatic and Lee the Military Believer. Lee was not some kind of grandiose, kind-hearted benevolent man. For one year he committed his troops to a hopeless cause in Petersburg. He watched them starving and dying for no reason. Grant begged him to stop the carnage and Lee refused over and over . Think about that Lee when you are watching Gettsburg and I think you will understand the message.

485928,5,6302548748,"What really can be added about this famous movie? I guess not much but I will leave some of my humble comments. I like this movie very much. I have watched it many times. I know it has flaws. I still like it very much. The acting by the main actors is very good, very good indeed (to paraphrase Lee from the film). Jeff Daniels is great as Joshua Chamberlain. He brings the man back to life in so many different ways and he is a dead ringer for the real Chamberlain. I really like the other actors too, especially Tom Berenger. Berenger makes a truly great Longstreet and makes him very human and moving. The character was one of my favorites in the novel and I think Berenger does him justice. Richard Jordan is great as Armistead and Stephen Lang IS Pickett. Sam Elliott makes for a wonderful John Buford he really embodies the old Indian fighter and a man who is down to his last battle. Over the years I have come to respect Martin Sheen's depiction of Lee and he is in one my favorite scenes in the movie. This movie tries very hard to be great and I think that it comes close. I have watched it too many times to be completely unbiased but I still think that for all people that it is a worthwhile movie. The battle scenes of the 20th Maine on Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge are very good and moving. The opening credits are great and the music enhances the film.

Maybe one day a longer cut of the film will be released on DVD. When the film was shown on TNT lately it had numerous deleted scenes. It is too bad these are not viewable on the DVD in some way. The picture and sound quality on the DVD are quite good. Maybe a super deluxe edition of the movie will be released on DVD around 2013 since that is the 150th anniversary of the battle.

 'The Killer Angels' was great source material and I think that 'Gettysburg' did justice to it. I wish more quality Civil War films were made. Highly recommended!",1249776000,,1922,4.260273972602739
485929,5,6302548748,"Gettysburg is, in my opinion, the best Civil War movie ever made, if not the best war movie ever made. It tells the story of the three-day long battle at Gettysburg, which, occurring at the same time as the surrender of Vicksburg, marked the turning point of the war. The movie accurately follows the historical novel ""The Killer Angels"". It is a very balanced movie, showing the battle from both sides, casting no stones and showing how heroic stubbornness on both sides both won and lost important phases of the battle. The theatrical version of the movie is over three hours long, but was so engrossing I didn't realize how much time had passed until the movie ended. Over 5,000 reenactors, with authentic reproductions of Civil War equipment and uniforms, gave realistic, crowded battlefield scenes, the line has rarely been seen before. Authentic tactics were used, also, and just like in the real battles, the black powder smoke made it difficult to see the battle field. A great story, well told, and with no obvious blunders (like using the wrong vintage of firearms) to mar the enjoyment. A must for all civil war buffs!",1246752000,2,1129,4.824742268041237

On the bright side, this is a story that needed telling but four hours worth? Turner's bias shows  in portraying the Confederates as noble defenders of liberty with strong  personalities. Union troops were mere androids (Chamberlain's 20th Maine the exception). Kudos to Jeff Daniels for a fine job portraying Col. Chamberlain. Cut the campfire prattle and the remaining 2 1/2 hours would be a pretty good and accurate film.

In September, I'll be in Gettysburg for my fifth visit. I make a point  of  paying respects to those buried there - especially the unknowns. This time, I think I'll add an apology for the shoddy treatment of Union soldiers by Mr. Fonda.",1246665600,,938,4.89873417721519
485931,3,6302548748,"After having seen the movie Gettysburg about 10 years ago, and after having researched it for a 7th grade project in the 1970's, I finally got around to reading ""Killer Angels"".

It may be a cliche, but as they say ""the book is much better"".
If you have NOT read the book, but have seen the movie, I urge you to consider the book.

While the movie gives you live actor battle scenes that you simply don't see anymore in today's CGI dominated movies, the book does a much better job of getting you inside the head of some of the main characters.  It highlights how Buford's important role early on is almost forgotten in history, how incompetent most of the top brass was in the Union army, what a great if reluctant leader of men Chamberlain was, and how Longstreet struggled with the iconic Lee's tactics throughout the battle.

As for efficacy of the acting in the movie having the same emotional impact as the book, overall I think it is a mixed bag.  Most of the actors in the movie are just OK, but Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain stands out.  His speech to the 2nd Maine about what they are fighting for, and the bayonet charge still brings a lump to my throat.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, I think Tom Berenger was TERRIBLE as Longstreet.  His lines were deadpan and nowhere did I see his internal angst during the battle which was very well represented in the book.  I also think that the book was as fair a depiction of the character of the men on both sides as possible, while the movie's depiction of the ""Cavalier"" gentlemen officers of the Confederate Army was a bit ""over the top"".  Many of them seemed overly sentimental and ""foppish"", especially Pickett.

In any case, my verdict is good (but long movie), GREAT, GREAT book.

My personal grudge against Mike Shaara goes back to 1964 when we were both at Florida State University.  What is my reason for relating all this?  If I can change my attitude toward the author, anyone can give him a second chance.  It still hurts me to give five stars to this work.  But the following reasons make it necessary:
1.  The book is very well written.  Mike had many choices how to work the story.  I probably would have made it unreadable by including too many characters.  Mead was barely mentioned.  John Hood could have been played up more considering his importance later in the war, but it didn't belong in this work.
2. I disagree with not only Mike but many professional historians that the Battle of Gettysburg is overrated.  Considering this I'm surprised at how well the author related this story.  I have no problem with the historic content of this book or the later movie.
3. The characterization in the book and the movie is superb.  This is fiction, but excellently done fiction.  If I had not been curious about this work I probably would never have picked it up. I am glad I did read it and even glad I saw the movie.",1245715200,2,1314,4.512711864406779

The DVD must have become more and more scratched over the years to where it skips here and there.  It's definitely worth my getting this replacement copy.  The lessons on leadership in this DVD (like ""The Killer Angels"" book) teach so much about courage and cowardice, leadership and the lack thereof, hubris and being humbled, influence and frustration, along with brotherly love, and more.

For example, one general requests to be moved from his role with another, senior, general.  He had tried to get this general to allow him to push the troops of the North off the ridge shortly after the North retreated to it.  The North was vulnerable then and there was a reasonable chance the South could have pushed the North off, making the North continue their retreat.  But the senior general wouldn't support that effort.  As a result the North got the chance to establish themselves on the ridge...and the rest is history.

Perhaps the North would ultimately still have won, but this DVD points out so well the role of not so much strong leadership as good leadership or of good and strong men in important leadership roles.

I lived in Gettysburg for a handful of months many years ago and crossed parts of the battlefield many times.  I still feel a deep reverence for the men who died there, for our country and for that God who helped us achieve a breadth and depth of liberty unparalleled in the world.

Alot of bonding, many philosopical interludes, even while battle lines are being formed. Though, if actual Civil war diaries are a guide, the ""foot soldier"" was a literate individual, a ""student"" of war. This motif is therefore, realistic; though the synthetic soundtrack doesn't help. At times, it sounds like outtakes from the ""Rocky IV"" sessions.
The script mentions 15 thousand here and 20 thousand there, and all we see are the same 160 guys huffing and puffing. Reviewers have criticized the unrealistic look of the ""Re-enactors"", but I understand that the Southern army did include many participants who did not fit the image, so to speak, because of the necessities of maintaining reasonable numbers. Although, I assumed that to be later in the War.
The script seems to be overly slanted towards the Military historian, as the constant references to flanks, infantry, cavalry, brigades, moving within specific battleplans, gets almost comical, which is not respectful to our Country's signature battle.
In the ending credits, it is written that the Battle was a (relative) failure. Some of the most interesting sections involve dialogue with the Generals regarding the potential of such a battle to actually end the War.
Very interesting montage at the end credits where actor and actual person come together. A bit crass but effective.

That's because the battle scenes are largely played by 're-enactors' who do this all the time. Many look lethargic, not like men ducking death from lead bullets flying all around. The real battle would have been much more chaotic. Steven Spielberg probably should have made this to give it the realistic touch so desperately needed. It comes across like a school play with a big budget. The extras are good, though. The best way to watch it is with the commentary track on.

485984,5,6302548748,"Being an active professor, a war film collector, and a twenty-five-year military veteran, I sometimes tend to be overly-critical of war films, mostly in terms of historical accuracy and ""situational believability.""  The pains the producers took make this both an enjoyable film yet as historically accurate as they could are especially noteworthy.

Numerous other reviewers have accomplished excellent detailed descriptions of the unfolding events that evolved into the Battle of Gettysburg, as described in the film, so I will limit my comments to those that I believe will focus on overall quality.

The film accurately presents the evolution of events that slowly build into one of history's most important battles, one that neither side really wanted to fight on this site, despite the fact that it proved to be ""good ground"" for such a massive engagement.  One aspect of this ""crescendo approach"" that I most appreciated was the presentation of many views of the characters and personalities of the military figures from both sides of the conflict.

One of the most important revelations was the fact that General Robert E. Lee was not the strategically infallible figure that many historians portray, and that certain decisions he made, despite the opposition of his excellent corps and division commanders, ultimately turned the battle in the Union's favor.  The film also subtly presented the effect on the battle's strategy and outcome of the untimely death of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, as presented in ""Gods and Generals.""

When I first saw the listings on the cast of this film, I was taken aback, since I had mentally stereotyped some actors' in previous roles that would not seem to be a ""fit"" for their roles in this film.  However, Martin Sheen did a fine job as Robert E. Lee, Tom Berenger was superb as General Longstreet, Stephen Lang excelled as General Pickett, and so on.  The greatest surprise was the performance of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose performance is followed here and further expanded upon in ""Gods and Generals,""  ""Gettysburg's"" prequel.  This film, and his performance in ""The Crossing"" clearly showed what a fine and versatile actor Daniels is.

It would be redundant to describe some of the most fantastic battle scenes ever filmed, as this has been well-covered by other reviewers.  ""Utterly fantastic"" about covers it, in terms of realism and a ""spare no expense"" attitude on the parts of the producers who desired historical accuracy in the making of the film.

I seriously cannot imagine any collector who would not place this film near the top of most valued films of all time.  Simply priceless, especially in terms of emphasizing the always elusive ""human side"" of war films.",1214784000,6,2759,5.127232142857143

The book is based largely on the writings and letters of Longstreet. The book covers in depth the feelings and ideas of the men who planned and fought the battle, something I felt the movie failed to do. When reading the book I found myself deeply saddened by the losses the confederates had because you got to see inside the men's minds and know what they were thinking and feeling and that they were extremely brave and gallant men, this does not happen in the movie. In the movie the fault of the southern disaster lies fully with Lee but when I read the book I had to place some of the blame on Longstreet and other southern generals for not standing up to Lee more forcefully to press their point to fight elsewhere where they would hold the high ground. Something they had done very successfully up until now. In the book Lee thinks that the second day of battle was almost a success while Longstreet does not see it this way. Longstreet, however, does not press this point with Lee. In the book Longstreet goes through every step of the last day of battle in his mind. He knows his men will be cut to pieces but also knows that it is useless to argue with Lee, because Lee will not change his mind. He lets himself and his men down and he knows it. After giving the order to attack on the last day of this battle Longstreet walks off alone and leans against a fence with his head down while tears run down his face as the battle rages around him, he knows what the results of the battle will be and what he has done. You don't get this kind of feeling in the movie. In the movie you get to see the battle but it fails to make you realize what the men were about and the vast amount of men that were killed and wounded in this one battle. Over 50,000 men killed.

Martin Sheen was horrible as Lee, very poor acting on his part as far as I am concerned. He managed to make Lee look almost lifeless and almost retarded. Picket never seemed to lead the infamous charge that bears his name and that virtually destroyed his division. Most of the other main parts, those of Longstreet, Pickett and Chamberlain were well acted which saved the movie from being a total flop.

485987,3,6302548748,"This movie is based on the book ""The Killer Angels"" which is an awesome work of art (Pulitzer Prize winning novel).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book thoroughly before attempting to watch this movie.  The book is flat out phenomenal.  The movie, on the other hand, was disappointing for me.  I'll try to explain why I thought so.  First of all, the acting in this movie is not the best work done by the actors that appear in the movie, most of whom have impressive resumes.  The way Martin Sheen portrays Robert E. Lee makes one wonder how this General could have achieved such a lofty reputation.  I think Sheen was off base in his effort here.  Tom Berenger, however, plays a great General Longstreet.  The fake beards in the movie are terrible and hard to over-look as you're watching it and trying to follow this gripping story.  You almost can't stop yourself from laughing at the makeup.  The movie itself is very long, around 4 hours, and you have to flip the DVD over after viewing the first half, which in itself is not a problem, but I would think that the director could include more important scenes in a movie of that length than some of the scenes left in.  For example, I would have liked the movie to explore the interaction between Lee and Longstreet AFTER the battle (which the book does some).  This movie is hard to follow if you haven't read the book and already have an idea where the story is going.  The movie jumps around and it is easy for the first time viewer to get lost and not understand where the movie is going as it bounces around from one side of the battle to the other and from one character to another.  The movie makers didn't do a good enough job transitioning from scene to scene to keep the audience clued in to what was happening and why a particular chain of events was important to the story and the outcome. If you are a true civil war ""buff"" I definitely think you should watch the movie, but don't expect a masterpiece or a great piece of work.  Movies are NEVER as good as the books they are based upon.  It seems that the acting in this movie is ""wooden"" with the actors reading from pages of script, as if hurried along to get finished.  The way the scenes were shot gives the movie an ""artificial"" feel as if they are on a stage with a bunch of props and as a result the movie doesn't feel ""realistic"".  It seems as though you are watching a re-enactment instead of actual events (other war movies escape this trap and make the audience feel they are watching the actual event).

The movie appears to accurately portray the actual events of those three days of July 1863. I would, however, recommend watching the ""making of the movie"" sections first as the characters and events are difficult to follow without some preliminary study. Also recommend having a battlefield map at hand.

485990,4,6302548748,"The four hour battle of Gettysburg was on the whole very entertaining, well shot with good action.  The story focuses on two viewpoints, that of James Longstreet and Joshua Chamberland and we view the story through their eyes.

Unfortunately, as an historian I saw the vast amount of visual errors in fact which are constantly taking place.  The worst being scenes that are placed in the wrong time sequence for the first day's fighting.  Second was the charge at Little Round Top.  If you have ever been there you know its not that long a slope.  It takes only a couple seconds from the battle line to the saddle between the two Round Tops.  The movie shows this as a long long sloping ground which it is not. And finally did anyone notice the credits?  There are cast members listed who are not shown in the film...cutting room floor I guess.  (I now understand from reading further posts that there was at one time a Collector's Edition Video Tape which has more footage so I guess this is where the missing cast went.)

The storyline is however is essentially correct as there are no errors in fact contained in the spoken dialogue.  Many of the spoken lines are taken directly from first hand accounts of the battle.

But as a Civil War (Gettysburg) story I enjoyed the movie for it places you in the lives of those men who fought there and on the whole is worth seeing despite the technical errors.

  However, what makes this movie stand out are those qualities that cannot be measured. Perhaps it was the fact that most of the ""extras"" were actual civil war re-enactors who played their parts out of love and loyalty, perhaps because it was filmed on the actual grounds where the action occurred which, along with the Alamo, is the most hollowed ground on American soil, perhaps because as an American I realized how much I owed to every man who fought those three days - on both sides of the field - who gave ""their last full measure of devotion"".

Armisted is tormented by the war because his dear friend Win Hancock is on the other side.  Jordon plays this wonderfully.

486012,4,6302548748,"I won't spend a huge amount of time describing the story beyond saying that this film tells the horrific saga of the American Civil War Battle of Gettysburg where thousands of Americans on both sides were slaughtered. This was the final turning point of the war, the Confederates getting decimated by the Federals at this tragic 1863 battle.

Here are some things I really liked about the film:

1. The widescreen cinematography and settings are all nothing short of  superb.

2. The film-maker pretty much stuck to the truth of how events transpired.

3. I expected to be bored with a huge chunk of historical wallpaper building up to the actual battle -- this did NOT happen and the action commences almost right away.

4. The considerable length of this epic film allowed for good story development, but at the same time, did not result in making the film drag at any point.

Unfortunately, I have to comment that Martin Sheen manifested the weak link in this otherwise fine movie. He grossly over-acted his central role and, in the end, one comes away thinking that Robert E. Lee was a half-crazy and demented old man, well-past his prime as a Commanding General. You likewise end up embracing a false sense that Lee was the SOLE cause that the Rebels endured a drubbing at Gettysburg while, in truth, there were multiple additional factors affecting the final outcome. Part of this is the fault of the screenwriters but part is also linked to Sheen's tainted portrayal of Lee. Since Sheen played such a major role in the film, for me at least, his poor acting dragged this excellent film down from five stars to four.

In every other instance, as far as the actors are concerned, I felt that everyone played his role to near-perfection. Also, the little summary at the end of the film which relates what happened to the principal real combatants was a great way of ending the movie.

To summarize, if you are at all a fan of either war films, or of Civil War trivia, you'll certainly not be disappointed in the overall excellent quality of ""Gettysburg"".",1198022400,3,2058,4.694444444444445

486014,5,6302548748,"Gettysburg is actually the second part in an intended trilogy that will now probably never be completed in the wake of the dismal box-office for the bloated Gods and Generals. Thankfully it gains more by having a smaller canvas, focussing on one single battle and largely on three actions - Buford's inspired initial defense on the first day, Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge - and by seeing the action from the viewpoint of both sides throughout. The characters are better drawn, the dialogue feels more natural and you get much more of a sense of what a human tragedy the war was. As a British observer on the Confederate side points out, it all boils down to ""same people, different dreams.""

The problem with most epics devoted to single battles or campaigns (Waterloo, Zulu Dawn, The Battle of Neretva etc) is that without a single dominating personality they often get so bogged down with history or strategy that the human element gets lost, with a succession of stars acting almost like anonymous interchangeable sports commentators only there to explain what's going on for the layman. Gettysburg has its share of characters primarily there for exposition, but by narrowing its focus to a few of them and drawing on their own letters and memoirs it's able to give them a little more depth and personality. Martin Sheen's Lee's increasingly wrong-headed strategy as he consigns more and more men to pointless deaths with a homespun rationale that leads to horrifying casualties contrasts well with Tom Berenger's more cautious Longstreet gradually realising that the tide has turned against them while Jeff Daniels' awkward but sincere Lawrence Chamberlain gives a humane and decent voice to the Union's case. Richard Jordan is genuinely affecting in his last role - his final scene is even more moving with the knowledge that he really was dying at the time - and even George Lazenby even turns up briefly. As a result, there's more involvement in what's happening and more understanding of what's at stake on a personal level to both sides during the battle. Although shot as a TV miniseries before being released theatrically, it actually looks like a feature film, and one that manages to hold the interest over its four hour running time. It's such an impressive piece of work that you can't help but wonder why so many of the same people got it so wrong so often on Gods and Generals.

Excellent extras on the double-sided DVD, but sadly none of the deleted scenes from the 270-minute laserdisc director's cut.",1194912000,2,2529,4.906542056074766
486015,3,6302548748,"For a full decade or so I was what you'd call a ""Civil War Buff."" I formally and informally studied the 5-year ultra-bloody engagement. I've been to Antietam in Northern Maryland, the bloodiest single day of the war, Vicksburg, Mississippi, and, of course, Gettysburg (amongst other less significant sites). When I was at Antietam one of the eye-witness quotes was: ""Bodies filled the entire field with every imaginable wound."" I was so overwhelmed tears flowed from my eyes.

Why do I bring all this up? I just want you to know how INTO the Civil War I was (and still am, to a lesser degree), not just on an intellectual level, but an emotional one as well.

So in December 1993 my then-fiance and I went to the theater to see the over-four-hour-long ""Gettysburg"" with much interest. All I can say is it was VERY DIFFICULT to sit through this entire film in one sitting.

""Gettysburg"" has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.

The subjects of the Civil War and Gettysburg are immensely interesting. You would think, therefore, that ""Gettysburg"" would be overflowing with life, but that's hardly the case. It takes FOREVER for things to get going. Plus there's an undeniably lazy and unexciting feel to the settings and dialogue when the forces aren't actually fighting. One has to REALLY CONCENTRATE to listen to and get through the interminable dialogue. Plus the mawkish melodrama factor is high.

Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his mad bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films.

The score is only half good. You'll definitely hear spots of brilliance but way too often it's sickeningly ultra-""heroic"" or melodramatic.

One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire.

BOTTOM LINE: There's a lot to respect about ""Gettysburg."" It's a story about war and the men who engage in it, pure and simple. There's no female cast members, no forced romances. Unfortunately it's bloated, melodramatic and just plain lazy. Trust me, the REAL Gettysburg battle was anything BUT lazy and uninteresting. Still, if I concentrate hard to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth owning or renting. I'm glad I own it. But don't expect something great like, say, ""Glory.""

The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, in fact (along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg). After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for another two long years (almost) as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible and courageous fight, but the odds were against them. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.

General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: "" 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God! is that all?""

Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln  came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory.

But this is a long movie.  A really really long one.  At 4 hours and 15 minutes it's one of the longest feature films ever released.

486019,2,6302548748,"The movie seemed historically accurate as told from the Union side. Unfortunately, the movie leaves out many important battlefield events--events like the ""battle of the wheatfield,"" or the fighting in the orchard. Much is left out. My main complaint was a lack of passion in this movie--a lack of emotion. The characters walk into the battle like toy soldiers, albeit colorful ones. They seem to take pride in a lack of emotion. On every level, this movie fails to show the stress of battle, the fear, the hatred, the horror or emotion of human beings shooting each other down by the hundreds like cattle on a smoky, choking, dusty, noisy, confused battlefield. Maybe I am missing the point, but I just could not feel this movie--it lacked emotion, and I probably would not watch it again.",1189814400,7,790,4.8161764705882355
486020,3,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is an epic recreation of this pivotal battle of the US Civil War.

It combines huge battle scenes with intimate conversations among the famous personalities including Lee, Pickett, Armistead, Longstreet on the Confederate side, and Hancock and Chamberlain on the Federal side.

Standout performance are Tom Berenger as the cautious Longstreet and Martin Sheen as the legendary Robert E. Lee.

At over four hours in length ""Gettysburg"" will test the patience of many viewers. It has feel of a mini-series and would be ideal to spread over two nights rather than watching it in one go. The characters indulge in a little too much speechifying and some of the battle scenes - staged using Civil War reenactors - seem a bit tame - but overall this is a well-made film.

486021,4,6302548748,This is a great movie.  This is our second purchase of this CD as we scratched our first one and wanted Gettysburg in our movie library.,1188259200,,136,4.230769230769231
486026,5,6302548748,"This is a nice transfer of novel to screen.  Michael Shaara's work is well known to those interested in the Civil War.  It used an interesting technique--selecting several characters and reporting their observations of events and their perspectives and understanding of those.  Among the key characters from whose eyes we see things include: Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Winfield Scott Hancock, and--from the First Day--John Buford.  This is a long movie, over 4 hours.  But to encapsulate as sprawling a battle as Gettysburg, this is altogether appropriate.

What of the cast?  Overall, awfully good for a movie that is far from a traditional theater release.  Martin Sheen plays Robert E. Lee (I'm not sure that he's as wooden as some reviewers comment, but his ""It's all in God's hands now"" does become a bit stale by the end); Jeff Daniels is quite affecting as Chamberlain (he has an appropriate academic air and portrays an amateur's sense of warfare); Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten, crusty Buford is almost perfectly cast; Tom Berenger does a nice job portraying Longstreet's discomfort with strategy and tactics and a foreboding of the battle's outcome.  Secondary characters are played well, too, such as Stephen Lang's George Picket, Richard Jordan's Lew Armistead, and Kevin Conway's Sergeant Kilrain.  All in all, the acting is quite well done.

The scope of the movie?  It begins with the hours before the meeting engagement at Gettysburg (this was an ""accidental"" battle with neither side anticipating a great fight there).  Among the scenes is a delightful meeting among Armistead, Pickett, and Longstreet in which a pleasantly diverting discussion of Charles Darwin takes place.

The first day featured the confrontation between Harry Heth's division and Buford's cavalry.  As the pressure begins to be too much, General John Reynolds, at the head of the fearsome fighter of the First Corps arrives.  At this point, the movie gets a but fuzzy historically.  One gets the sense that the line starts collapsing at one place as the Iron Brigade arrives at another, under the direct command of Reynolds.  This is misleading; the forces to the immediate north of the Iron Brigade did not collapse until after Reynolds' placement of the fighting Westerners and his death.  The day ends with a powerful meeting between Buford and the Union generals gathering at Gettysburg.

On the Second Day, the key action in the movie includes Devil's Den and Little Round Top.  On that day, much more happened, including desperate fighting on Cemetery Ridge and Culp's Hill, not depicted in this movie (but the movie is already long at 4 hours, so this is merely a minor quibble).  The DVD accepts pretty much without question Chamberlain's rather self-serving version of the 20th Maine's stalwart fight, protecting the left flank of the Union army.  Nonetheless, this is a powerful scene and works most nicely.

The Third Day?  The focus is Pickett's Charge (technically a misnomer, since other divisions were involved as well (Pettigrew and Trimble commanded troops as well).  The tension of the day is well portrayed.  E. Porter Alexander directed a massive cannonade to try to wreak havoc on the Union Center.  At the close of the barrage, the 12,000-15,000 Confederate troops are shown beginning their doomed charge.  The music swells in a most affecting scene.  And then the carnage begins, with Union artillery and later rifled musket fire decimating the attackers.

Much poignancy in this third day.  The personal courage of Hancock (which appears to be historically accurate), the brave last stand by Armistead (also correct), the effort by Lee to inspire his troops after the repulse, and so on.

There are some historical glitches here.  The movie misses many dramatic moments (although how could it be otherwise with the time limitations of a movie format?).  On the whole, however, this is a powerful version of the critical battle at Gettysburg.  Well worth watching.",1187395200,8,4012,5.137345679012346

Much too long for theatrical release.  So he premiered it on his cable network, TNT in 1993.  The battle scenes itself are worth the long run time.  It's not too graphic and works as a historical referrence.  That may be it's downfall, as well.  Another is the long stretches of dialogue.

486028,5,6302548748,"Gettysburg is a great movie that was inspired by one of the most decisive battles during the Civil War. Ronald Maxwell, the director, hired a historain, James McPherson so help him in making sure the battle scenes were as true as they actually happened in 1863. Gettysburg has three days of fighting along with events that led up to the war making it very gory and action-packed. There is alot of death in this movie but since Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest battles with 50,000 American casualties, the amount of death in the movie is appropriate.

The first day of fighting consists of Buford trying to maintain his position in Gettysburg to make sure that the Union army has the best land position. The second day of fighting is centrally located at Cemetery Hill, Little Round Top, and Culp's Hill. The third and final day at Gettysburg consisted of one of the most famous battles at Gettysburg: Pickett's Charge. This is the day that Lee realizes that he has to retreat due to too many Confederate losses.

This movie is, historically, very correct. The locations of the battles are historicall accurate along with the general's names. Mostly everything in this movie was, in McPherson's eyes, historically accurate. One can learn alot about the Civil War by watching this movie because it shows how the soldiers felt and lived and the effects of war on them. It also talks about past and upcoming issues in the war. This was a great historical movie but also very entertaining and i would recommend it to anybody that was interested, or wants to become knowledgable about the Civil War.",1181606400,7,1596,4.778985507246377

486030,5,6302548748,"Turner Pictures' ""Gettysburg"" is the lengthy but fascinating dramatization of Michael Shaara's classic Civil War novel ""The Killer Angels.""  At mini-series length and populated with an army's worth of solid actors, ""Gettysburg"" delivers the gripping story of the three-day battle as experienced by some of the key personalities.

Among the highpoints:

Sam Elliot as hardbitten Union Cavalry General John Buford, who recognized the value of the terrain at Gettysburg and whose decision to stand there helps bring on the battle.

Jeff Daniels is absolutely superb as Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, a professor at Bowdoin College become a leader of men at war.  Jeff Daniels manages to capture both the intelligence and the determination that won Chamberlain a Medal of Honor in the desperate struggle for the end of the Union line at Little Round Top.

Tom Berenger gives a nuanced and conflicted performance as Confederate General Longstreet, Lee's most reliable Corps Commander, who advises Lee against the Battle at Gettysburg and who must overcome his better instincts to execute Lee's orders.

Martin Sheen does his best to deliver as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, but only just fails to capture the charisma and the hidden steel that made Lee such a deadly and successful battlefield commander for so long.  Perhaps the best of his performance  in this movie is his meeting with his missing cavalry commander, J.E.B. Stuart, after the second day of battle.

The movie was filmed over the actual ground at Gettysburg using properly equipped re-enactors who add much authenticity to the battle scenes.  The sharp-eyed viewer will enjoy picking out a number of actors hiding behind more or less authentic period whiskers.  The magnificent score adds to the appreciation of what was at stake at Gettysburg, while the prologue and epilogue provide a haunting sense of the harsh fates awaiting many of the key players in the battle.

This movie is most highly recommended to fans of the Civil War who are prepared to overlook some TV-movie production shortfalls for an entertaining and educational dramatization of the Civil War's most fateful battle.",1176854400,10,2190,5.222857142857142

The battle scenes were well developed so that the viewer could make sense of the charges, the wins, the loses. The film was able to capture General Lee's determination to engage the enemy even if under poor conditions. In the book, the Killer Angels, it is explained that Lee was a student of the warfare strategies of Napoleon Bonaparte and Bonaparte argued to always assume the offensive for the defensive position eventually results in loss.

The leadership of Lee is compared to the Leadership of Longstreet, Lee's second in command. Longstreet advised not to engage under the circumstances offered at Gettysburg. In hindsight, it was Longstreet who was correct and Lee who made a critical misjudgement that turned the tide of the war.

My only small concern was that historians have told us that Longstreet was a military genius but also a moody, somber man who continually grieved the loss of all 4 of his children who died on the same day from scarlet fever. Longstreet was not known to be an overfriendly man. Yet Tom Beringer plays Longstreet a bit more optimistic and upbeat than his reputation, his writings, and the observations of those around him would lead us to believe.

Yet GETTYSBURG does so.

This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history.

A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle.

Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College.

The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance.

486050,5,6302548748,"This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, ""The Killer Angels"", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).

The viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.

The rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers.

When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.

Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.

As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.  When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time.  Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie.

486075,4,6302548748,"Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.

I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.

I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.

Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.

The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.

Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film.",1153353600,5,3220,4.949814126394052

I would probably appreciate this movie even more if I did know more about that horrible conflict. Being familiar with all the small towns surrounding Gettsyburg wouldn't hurt.

The movie is well-acted, nicely filmed and has some memorable scenes. My only complaints are that some of the action scenes go on too long and I didn't appreciate the plug for Darwin's evolutionary theories, which had no place in this film. However, this is a Turner Pictures film and the ""Turner"" is outspoken atheist Ted Turner, it's no surprise we get this thrown in our faces.

Otherwise, they stuck to the war story. It was interesting how they portrayed Robert E. Lee. They make him look a little stupid in his strategy but also gave him a compassionate look, and you couldn't help but feel sorry for the man. Actually, all the officers on both sides were portrayed fairly as nothing but good and brave men.

Jeff Daniels, as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, had the best role and came off looking the best. It may be Daniels' best work ever, too. Martin Sheen was outstanding as Lee. Kudos to Tom Berenger (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet) and Richard Jordan (Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead) for their performances, too.

It's a quality show, filmed on the Gettysburg sites, too. Although there are a few long fight scenes, this is not a bloody film. Language-wise, this probably holds the record for the most usage of the word ""damn"" but that's it, profanity-wise.

I wouldn't let the length of this movie prohibit you from watching it. You can always break it up into segments over a couple of days.",1146355200,5,1705,4.708053691275167

We're both Civil War buffs among other things. Avidly read much on the subject. Killer Angels being among those books we read.

Seeing the movie was logical.

We were not disapointed in our expectations. Far from it.

It was long but we wished it were even longer as the content was histoicly accurate and well packed. Performances were excellant. Jeff Daniells as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was super superb. Only Martin Sheen's peformance as Robert E. Lee was better. We loved the music. We loved the costuming. We loved the fighting scenes. Everything was great.

486093,4,6302548748,"I recommend this movie.  It deserves its four stars.

I was one of the thousands of reenactors who helped make the movie in 1992.  I'll give you a true story.  You'll see rows of cannons shooting.  That's real.  Did you know those cannons shot down the radio controlled helicopter that was used to carry camera equipment?  It was the third film take of the Confederate cannon barrage for Picket's charge.  The day was hot, long, and filming was not going well.  The helicopter flew down the line taking pictures of the cannons going off.  Instead of flying to the end of the cannons the controller put the helicopter right in front of the cannon muzzle as it went off.  The blast knocked the helicopter out of the sky.  So, in 1992 a Confederate cannon crew shot down a helicopter.

Facts, this movie is fairly accurate.  It's not perfect.  They could not show the fighting on Cememtary Hill nor the skirmishing on the forth day.  However, it's accurate and most of us extras spent nearly $1000 ('92 dollars) on getting the correct clothing and equipment.

The one fact that you'll like in this movie is it shows the desperate fighting on Little Round Top.  Yep, the only thing that saved this republic was a Union colonel who used to be a school teacher and his little regiment of Maine Infantry.  Did you know that the US Army considers this ""small unit action"" to be one of the defining moments in history?  I will not give away how it goes.  However, Jeff Daniels is in his prime and does a fantastic job of capturing the mood of the moment.

I did not like Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee.  That costs a star.

The rest of the movie is pretty good.  Now, this movie isn't as good as the movie that defined the type: Glory.  Glory is a rare five star movie and it will go down as a classic of the age.  However, this movie is far better than the prequel, ""God's and Generals"".  You can get this movie for $6 on discount and you'll watch it every once in a while.  I would use this movie for school instruction on Civil War history.  Historically it's fairly accurate.  It only has a PG-13 rating.  If you used ""Glory"" some people may get upset over the very strong words in that movie.

I got this movie on discount.  If you look for a flying fence post at Picket's charge you'll see me, a small ""reb"" who is sprinting by the fence.

486096,5,6302548748,"Gettysburg is an excellent film. It is well acted, with excellent cinematography and outstanding realistic pacing. I won't get in-depth with the story, as that has already been done, but here are a few things any prospective viewer may want to know....
  First, the source material. The movie is based on the award winning (and EXCELLENT) book, The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara (incidentally, his son Jeff has been writing war novels to follow in his dad's footsteps for years now). The movie follows the novel closely, and for historically nitpickers, that isn't always a good thing. The most glaring example is the usage of Joshua Chamberlain as the 'unsung' hero of Gettysburg. As any true student of the Civil War should know, the events involving Chamberlain on Little Round Top in the book and the film are BASED ON CHAMBERLAIN'S OWN VERSION OF THE EVENTS. Chamberlain was a NOTORIOUS self-promoter after the war, and not a SINGLE man in his old command backed up his version of events. Quite a few outright disputed Chamberlain's version. For example, some insisted that Chamberlain's brilliant bayonett charge NEVER HAPPENED. Not that the charge didn't happen- just that Chamberlain had nothing to do with it. They stated that the charge happened spontaniously (a common occurence in the warfare of that era), and was NOT the result of any plan or order from Chamberlain. Chamberlain simply saw an opportunity to grab glory for himself by claiming credit for the charge. Any in-depth investigation into the man will reveal his true personal character was hardly the shining hero atop Little Round Top that he wished to convey. Taking personal credit for the spontanious actions of an entire regiment is not even ethical, much less heroic. Michael Shaara apparently bought Chamberlain's version of events hook, line, and sinker. Sadly, Shaara's book had such an impact on the public consciousness that many believe that the version of Chamberlain depicted in the book is based on real historical fact, when really it is at best EXTREMELY dubious storytelling. Having said that, Shaara's book is still very close to the actual events that happened. There is a little creative license to create drama, but for the most part it accurated depicts what happened during those three July days of 1863.
  One other minor grievance I had with the film was the battle scenes. While very authentic looking, the scenes still suffered from something that most war films suffer from: a lack of combatants! The assault on Little Round Top on the second day involved MANY thousands of confederate soldiers, yet the scenes of this assault only show about 20-30 rebels at any one time. Even a skirmish would involve more men assaulting the 20th Maine than that! Obviously, the budget constraints and shortage of reenactors are to blame, and so can be forgiven. Just be aware that ALL the assaults were MUCH grander in scope than what you are seeing onscreen, including the third day's charge (incorrectly labelled Pickett's Charge by history).
  Of course, both of these grievances are very minor points, and do not subtract from the power and drama of the film (notice I still gave it 5 stars!). The cast has a lot to do with why this movie is so powerful: an excellent job is done by virtually the whole cast, with Jeff Daniels standing out in particular (ironically enough, Daniels portrays Joshua Chamberlain). Daniels' scene when he learns of a comrade's death is the most poignant in the entire movie, and reminds us that the 'glory' of battle comes with a terrible price indeed. On a slightly more sour note, C. Thomas Howell does a barely adequate job. A better actor should have been chosen to portray Chamberlain's younger brother Tom, and thank god Ted Turner only has a cameo, his acting is ATROCIOUS.
  The location scenery is both historically accurate (or close enough) and beautifully utilized, and the battle choregraphy is quite good, considering the limited budget and largely volunteer cast of extras.
  Overall, Gettysburg is the absolute BEST Civil War movie ever made. It is very powerful, and if you you have any interest in one of the most important events in America's history, I encourage you to watch this movie. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECCOMENDATION!
  As a side note, a follow up movie, Gods & Generals, was made. Sadly, it does not live up to the expectations set by Gettysburg. Feel free to check out my review of Gods & Generals.",1141257600,7,4448,4.931818181818182

When I went to go see this movie in the theaters, there actually was an intermission.  There are two ways to approach a critique of this movie.  One is as a historical interpretation.  The movie is based on the book ""The Killer Angels"", and the book is very accurate in the course and scope of the battle.  For Civil War buffs, the book and movie are slanted towards Longstreets' recollection of the battle.  In that vein, the movie fits in nicely into the historiography of modern Civil War studies.  As a movie, the scope and cinematography have a very grand vision.  Some...repeat some...of the acting could be construed as overdoing it and Longstreet's beard looks like it was ordered from ""Beard Club For Men.""  Those are minor points however, and once the viewer gets past those parts, the main characters can more then hold their own.  For a Civil War buff, like myself, the movie never felt like it was slowly paced.  (Unlike the prequel ""Gods and Generals"" which was probably the most slowly paced movie in cinematic history.)  Martin Sheen has taken criticism for his portrayal of Lee, but I tend to believe that he was excellent as the patriarchal, beloved and aging Southern general.  From the viewpoint of the historian, Lee, in 1863 was convinced of his own invincibility and Sheen's acting brings this home.  Jeff Daniels, one of the most flexible actors of our generation, plays the sometimes aloof ex-professor Chamberlein with ease.  Overall, Gettysburg is just one interpretation of this momentous battle, with excellent acting on both sides.",1131840000,17,1695,4.853658536585366

Being as long as it is the movie is on both sides of the DVD and given how often one side of a double will get scratched sooner or later you will lose half of the movie. The special features themselves are split between both sides, most of them on side B.

A strange feature is that the individual interviews come across as unfinished and choppy given that they are clipped from the hour-long 'Making Of' feature narrated by Sheen. Not sure why they are redone in this manner.

The Gettysburg short produced by the park itself is a narration and sound effect piece using the monument locations in the park to overview the battle. Despite having no action at all it provides a good background to the overall fighting most of which you will not see in the movie.",1128470400,,1096,4.362745098039215
486124,1,6302548748,"Anyone, and I mean anyone, who has read much about Robert E Lee can see that the selection of Martin Sheen to portray Lee, and Sheen's inability to capture how most historians have described Lee are failures.  I also found that side of the movie dedicated to unstanding battlefield strategy and tactics was extremely poor.  There was an attempt to portray the poor intelligence both sides had to deal with, but I found the screen play was inferior in its treatment of what was happening all over the battlefield.  I give the film one star, and feel I'm being generous in doing so.

486125,5,6302548748,"Based on late author Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War novel THE KILLER ANGELS, GETTYSBURG brings the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil to life on the screen in one of the most moving, epic films ever made. The movie covers the brutal three-day conflict fought at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 1st through July 3rd, 1863 mainly through the experiences of three incredible men: Confederate General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), and Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels). Through these men and others, GETTYSBURG tells the story of this decisive engagement of the Civil War perfectly.

The whole cast's performances are stellar throughout the entire movie. Jeff Daniels' portrayal of the professor-turned-soldier Colonel Chamberlain stands out as one of the best performances in the film, along with Tom Berenger's excellent General Longstreet. And though Martin Sheen may not completely capture the physical characteristics of General Lee, he certainly captures his spirit. The minor roles are also incredibly well done, from Stephen Lang's Confederate General George Pickett to Kevin Conway's Union Sergeant ""Buster"" Kilrain. Each actor's similarities and historical accuracy-minded devotion to his character gives the film an incredible authenticity.

One of the many things that sets GETTYSBURG apart from so many other war movies is its amazing attention to historical accuracy. Not only was the movie filmed entirely on the actual battlefield locations in Pennsylvania, but the film also benefits hugely from how historically correct the uniforms, weapons, and sets are. Its use of over 4,000 Civil War reenactors makes its epic battles far more realistic, powerful, and moving than any movie could ever accomplish using computerization.

Every one of the battle scenes is astoundingly well-done and realistic. From Union General John Buford's first encounter with Rebel infantry to Colonel Chamberlain's courageous stand atop Little Round Top to the massive, climactic, heavy-with-emotion Pickett's Charge, each battle tells its own story, develops characters, and flows with energy and heroism.

The soundtrack to the movie is a glorious musical accomplishment. Composed by Randy Edelman, its combination of epic battle themes and classical Civil War-era music not only conveys the feel and emotion of the film perfectly, but also stands alone as the best soundtrack ever composed for a war movie.

With its spectacular cast, wonderful script, glorious soundtrack, epic battle sequences, constant devotion to historical accuracy, and more, GETTYSBURG delivers an unrepeatable, awe-inspiring portrayal of the courageous men of the Union and the Confederacy who fought in the Civil War.",1126569600,9,2800,5.705035971223022

As for the paid actors, Berringer does a very good job, as does Daniels and Lang, in making this a believable and entertaining piece of film making.  Filmed on location in beautiful Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the film is mostly accurate with respect to the structure and positioning of the many men who were involved in the 3-days of carnage in 1863.  I know the townspeople in Gettysburg were very proud of the production as many had a hand in its making.

There are no winners in this one...true of most factual historical accounts, but there were many brave, scared men who did what they had to do with what they had available to them.

Outstanding are Chamberlain's 20th Maine holding Little Round Top against insurmountable odds on day 2, and Pickett's Charge on the 3rd day of the battle resulting in the complete destruction of his division.  Both sequences are extremely riveting and moving.

Forget the 'politically correct' views of the characters as there is a lot of revisionist history in this one (consider the producer!), but it is a very good watch.  Definately NOT A CHICK FILM.  The film musical score is excellent.

486137,3,6302548748,"The widescreen edition of Gettysburg is a good movie to gain insights into the thinking of the Southern generals involved in the battle for the areas around Gettysburg. However, the battle scenes, which pre-date advanced computer character generation techniques and far below expectations of typical audiences in 2005.

About 25% of the story involves the actions around the infamous ""Pickett's Charge."" The movie does bring out the fact that although the action is named after Pickett, he wasn't doing this of his own desire. He was ordered. As Martin Sheen presents General Lee, Pickett's orders came from a general dealing with an overly-large ego and wanting to win the high ground regardless of the cost.

Today, many of the techniques demonstrated so successfully in The Lord of the Rings could be used to enhance the numbers of soldiers involved in the battles so that they would more closely resemble the masses (~75,000 from the South and ~90,000 from the North) involved in the battle. It is estimated about 15,000 men charged the center of the union line on the last day, walking across a mile of open land, going uphill to meet the Northern army. Certainly a remake of this scene alone could add a lot to the impact.

486159,5,6302548748,"What can I add that the other reviewers didn't say?  I have

watched this film numerous times and I never get tired of it.

The scene where Col Chamberlain leads the 20th Maine in the bayonet charge at Little Round Top literally brings tears to my eyes-such valour, such courage!  A Union officer once said that Pickett's Charge was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.  This film allows us to see it ourselves (of course we can never feel the dread and excitement the Union troops felt as they saw the Confederate line approaching!)

While there are many fine performances, I find Tom Berringer as General Longstreet the most engaging.  Here is a man who was at best ambivalent about the whole war (he tells the British observer that the South should have freed the slaves before they fired on Ft Sumter) and strongly opposed to the attack at Gettysburg, yet his strong sense of duty and loyalty to General Lee prodded him on to planning and carrying out an attack that he knew would be a disaster.  Similarly, it is known that Robert E Lee himself was not enthusiastic about slavery or succession, yet he states that he could not fight against his native Virginia.  We, today, can not relate to the motivations and loyalties that drove these men.  Lee has been considered, at least in the South, a saintly figure and they show the love his men had for him, yet the film portrays him as a complex figure.  He states that he ""enjoys"" the war (he once said ""it is good that war is so horrible lest we grow too fond of it"") and he thinks nothing of sending thousands of his men to their deaths, but we also see him deeply affected by the casualties.  We also see his overconfidence which blinds him to the true nature of the situation he finds himself in.  Some officers who fail him he treats gently (those who failed to capture the two Round Tops), but JEB Stuart he chews out for disappearing at a crucial moment (Stuart says there ""were reasons"" for his absence but they are not explained in the film).

One minor defect of the film is that the Union commander General Meade is barely seen and so we really don't get an idea of how Lee's Union counterpart played his hand. It is known that President Lincoln was very unhappy that Meade didn't pursue Lee and attempt to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat back to the Potomac River. It would have been interesting to show how Meade justified his lack of action (he probably felt the army was too exhausted and feared a Lee counter-attack).

Pickett's charge was especially moving.  I thought Berenger did a great job of playing the role of General Longstreet and many of the other parts were performed admirably.

One gripe I have is the beards.  Some of them were so phoney looking I couldn't help myself from laughing.  If they were to do it over again, they would need either a new make-up artist or make the actors grow a beard for the movie.

Another thing I really like about the movie is the score.  Truly moving music to accompany a military drama that shaped the course of events in our country.",1107907200,9,711,4.632

The general public will find the length and detail a bit too much, but anyone interested in the Civil War will find this an excellent recreation of the turning point in the war.

I teach high school US History, but I can only use parts of the movie for my classes because the kids start to glaze over by the third hour, but since the movie is filmed on location and so detailed I just use selected scenes to help explain the war and how it was fought.  Keeping track of who's who can be difficult for people unfamiliar with the Civil War - the book had descriptions of the main characters at the beginning so readers could keep track of the main characters, but obviously the movie could not really do this.",1106784000,6,830,4.483443708609271

Though the movie has some historical inaccuracies, no film out there comes as close to portraying true history as this one, especially about the Civil War. For the most part, the acting was superb, especially by Jeff Daniels. The portion of the film when Armistead speaks about his past friendship with Hancock is the most finely acted scene of any movie I have ever seen.

The acting is suberb, especially the performance of Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlain.  Martin Sheen gives a riviting perforance as Robert E. Lee, although Sheen's height in the saddle works against him at times (it is said Robert E. Lee had a long torso which gave him the appearance of being much taller on horseback, Sheen is often the shortest person in certain scenes). The epic battle scenes are often just a backdrop to the drama created between the characters in this film.  Even if you are not a ""war"" movie buff per se, this is a must see movie for any American.  Yes it is long, but this allows it to be true to Shaara's vision.  Yes there are some scenes that are overly mellow dramatic, yes the use of the terms ""good ground"" or ""high ground"" become annoying at times and yes several of the beards look like the glue is coming loose (I had to slip those in), but the above instances do not detract from the power of this film.

486166,4,6302548748,"Gettysburg is an excellent movie revolving around the Civil War battle of Gettysburg.  I felt this movie was unique in the fact it showed the strategy and the logistics of the battle rather than showing the blood, horror, and dismemberment that I would expect from a movie based on the bloodiest battle of the civil war.  The movie starts on June 30, 1863, the day before the battle at Gettysburg begins.  The movie mainly revolves around the involvement of two groups, the 20th Maine Regiment (commanded by Col. Chamberlain played by Jeff Daniels) and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (commanded by Gen. Lee played by Martin Sheen).

The movie does show its share of blood; however, I thought the movie did a brilliant job depicting the logistics of the battle and what happened behind the scenes of the battle.  The movie showed the people behind the war, not just the war itself.  For instance, the movie portrayed some of the reasons Gen. Lee led the Confederate Army to battle at this particular place and the reservations some of the Generals under Gen. Lee had with fighting the North at Gettysburg.  It also showed Col. Chamberlain dealing with problems unrelated to the battle, such as taking in over 100 Northern soldiers who refused to fight after their unit was disbanded.  I do not know enough about the history of the Battle of Gettysburg to say whether the contents of this movie is factual or not.

At over 4 hours, this movie is slightly on the slow side.  If your idea of a great war movie is Hamburger Hill or Rambo, this movie is definitely not for you.  If you are interested in the people behind war and the decisions they make, this movie is definitely worth watching.",1105488000,5,1700,4.69023569023569
486167,2,6302548748,"After a hard session of exams, I wanted to grab a film that would pull my thoughts away from the long hours of study. I came across this one and thought ""great, a history film !"" So, there I was embarked for over four hours of interesting war stories, or so I hoped. At the end, I ask myself how I could hold on and see it in one straight session. In fact, I concur with several reviewers who qualify it as an unconvincing film.

The actors (and some of them are good, confirmed actors) are extremely ""theatrical"" at times, extremely ""soulless"" at others.  They spend too much time talking in an unconvincing way about philosophical issues or collateral matters that don't bring anything constructive into the story or the film. The result is that the film never really ""takes off"". I don't know if this is a problem with the script, the direction, or if the ambitious project of recreating a historical battle just overwhelmed almost everybody in this project. The fact remains that, in my humble opinion, the only one that really keeps his head above water is Tom Berenger. Also, some actors just pop into the film out of the blue for no apparent reason (for instance that general from the confederates who visits Lee before the great battle to be severely criticized by his commander in chief for not following orders, and we never hear from him again), others, such as Sam Elliot, just disappear after starring in the first part of the film and we don't really know why and what happened to him either. Also very ""light"" is the role of that officer from her gracious majesty. I can understand the director is trying to show that the British were interested in seeing how the war would go and maybe helping the confederates, but I would have liked to see this treated in a more serious way instead of spending film showing an idiotic tourist in the middle of what remains a major event in American history. I was equally very disappointed by the actor playing Jeff Daniel's brother in this film. He was great in ""soul man"" (comedy of the mid eighties), but this was not a film for him. He gave me the impression from one end of the film to the other to try to find how to fit in. As for the battles, most of the shots cannot hide the lack of talent of the participating soldiers (reason : they are not actors but just ordinary citizen that re-enact the battle every year). The special effects are far below minimum (we miss Sam Peckinpah here) and quite repetitive, and most of the fake beards really look fake... adding to the lack of credibility of the overall final result.

Other major flaws are for instance the role of one of the Union's generals wife in this story. One of the Confederate generals gives Tom Berenger an item asking him to give it to that lady if he dies. We don't know why he does it, what relationship they had, and as a matter of fact we do not know until the very end of the film that it was a sample of the bible. So ? We also have the impression that Lee was an undecided leader (he first says he is going to reprimand a general of his for disobeying, then he congratulates him; he calls another to reprimand him and make him feel totally miserable but then refuses the resignation, and so on), wanting to emulate Napoleon, erroneously stubborn (none of the generals thought for a second they would succeed in their final assault), which is totally opposite to what I had read up to now in history books. Which is the good version ?

The best part of the film is the extra comments, which are also long, but very instructive. I enjoyed much more that part than the film itself. However, if you want a really good war related film, I would suggest you look for something else (Spartacus, The Battle of England, the Bridge on the river Kwai, Paths of glory,  the great escape, Saving Private Ryan, Sand Pebbles, Das Boot...). The list is really too long. That too puts ""Gettysburg"" at its place, down the ladder, regardless of the passion it may create because of the importance of the event for America and Americans.",1102896000,11,4048,4.472259810554804

But, that is not the reason that this movie is so powerful.  What is powerful about it are the powerful examples of leadership.  A couple of examples stand out. At the end of side one, the ""Battle of Little Round Top"" is highlighted.  At the end of the approximately 30 minute excerpt, the leader, Colonel Chamberlain is confronted with a problem.  His men have run out of ammunition.  However, if he retreats, since he is on the flank, the Confederates will ""go over the hill, hit our units from the rear and our whole flank will cave in...""  What does he do?  Then, someone exclaims: ""Here they come again!""  So, he says ""We'll fix bayonets"".  His subordinate says: ""What do you mean - charge?""  And, Chamberlain takes charge, telling his men that they can do it because ""the Rebs must be tired... and we have the benefit of going down hill..."".  Well, they charged and won... Another scene also highlights leadership with a different result.  On the second side, one of the focus is on General Armistead.  When it is clear that Picket's charge has failed, he places his hat on his sword, and tells his men, ""follow me"".  To one soldier, who is rightfully scared, he says ""what will think about yourself in the morning"".  All this is done, knowing he will fail and with the premonition that he expresses in the previous day that he will die. Examples of personal leadership, examples of personal courage.  These are real stories and stirring every time that I see them.  And, this movie does the best job of communicating these personal stories.

Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.

The history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ?

486180,4,6302548748,"This IS a long movie and some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired -- see other reviewers' comments. However, the movie has some excellent performances by Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Sam Elliott, and a few others.  I think the special features, especially the Making of Gettysburg and the Commentary are top knotch and give the viewer an even greater appreciation of the battles at Gettsburg and what is portrayed onscreen in the movie.

The Battle of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge in the film show the relentless human wave attacks that 20th century war buffs mostly associate with the Korean War and the Pacific campaign during WW II. However, GETTYSBURG conveys very well the disturbing reality that Civil War soldiers were killing relatives, friends, and neighbors in some of those battles and often in hand-to-hand combat.

Don't look for the pace of action or the graphic depiction of battle casualties to rival those seen in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. What the battle scenes in this movie depict is the deadly toll of large scale frontal assaults by both the Union and Confederate forces. It defies all logic to think that hundreds of men (thousands in Pickett's Charge) would march in formation while lethal cannon shells explode in their midst and enemy marksmen fire deadly volleys of musket rounds into the advancing ranks of foot soldiers and cavalry troops. Yet, with the aid of a small robotic helicopter used to film Pickett's Charge and the massive artillery barrage that preceded it, the scale of the battle and the deadly outcome for the attacking Confederate Army are depicted vividly.

The futile but heroic plight of Pickett's men becomes apparent well before the attack even begins. These were some of our forefathers shedding their blood on that hallowed ground, and the film helps to show how costly that War of the States would be on the country's psyche for nearly another century after the war ended.

Watch the movie, and judge for yourself.",1100822400,2,1995,4.908011869436201
486181,4,6302548748,"Caveat - I have given this movie a split star ranking of four/three stars. The target audience for Gettysburg is the Civil War enthusiast, and I believe that they will find my ranking of four stars appropriate. The general audience, with no particular interest in the American Civil War should consider this a three-star effort.
Gettysburg is based (fairly faithfully) on Michael Sharara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Killer Angels, and tells the story of the bloodiest single battle in American history. Like the novel, the movie does an excellent job of sympathetically presenting the perspectives of both the North and the South. It tells the stories of several officers who fought on both sides, and through highlighting their stories, shows the war not as a simple tale of good against evil, but as a tragedy of epic proportions, where cruel fate set friend against friend in bitter and deadly conflict.
This movie is filmed gorgeously. The filming was done on location around Gettysburg, and the landscapes are captures beautifully. It does an excellent job of showing the grand scale of armies in motion and the historical details of the uniforms, equipment, and other period touches are nearly flawless. Though the battle scenes don't attempt to accurately portray the actual carnage of war, they are fine spectacles, skillfully and dramatically done. The only flaw in the look and feel of this movie is with the ridiculously fake facial hair that several of the actors wear. It is a minor point, but was quite distracting, especially in close-up shots.
The acting in this movie was uneven, ranging from outstanding to woodenly bad. Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain delivered far and away the best performance of this movie, and possibly the best of his career. His Chamberlain is always believable, and does the heavy lifting in presenting the Union perspective. In the battle on Little Round Top, he was given the single best scene of the movie, and he rose to the occasion splendidly. Tom Berenger, as General Pete Longstreet had the most screen time on the Confederate side, and performed adequately, not brilliantly. His Longstreet had but two notes - dour and taciturn. He was also burdened with one of the worst fake beards in the movie, which proved constantly distracting. Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Robert E. Lee, while possibly historically accurate, (Lee was literally both sick and tired during his campaign in Pennsylvania) is unlikely to satisfy most fans of this general of ""sainted"" memory, and at any rate, is not one of his better performances. Steven Lang was wonderful in his role as the dim, vain, but likeable General Pickett. Sam Elliott, brought his usual imposing presence to the small role of Colonel Buford, but was given speeches to deliver rather than believable dialogue. An actor who seemed to have no sense of the historical General J.E.B. Stuart, and who sported the single worst fake beard of the movie butchered the role. The role of General Hood, who was a young man of 31, was miscast, played by an actor who appeared to be at least 50.
If you are a Civil War enthusiast, this is a must see movie despite its flaws. If not, you may still find it interesting if only for Jeff Daniels truly outstanding performance, but should probably rent, rather than buy it. I give it a qualified recommendation.

486182,2,6302548748,"What a waste of a fine cast.  Tom Berringer,( great in Platoon) Martin Sheen,(great in Apocalypse Now) and Jeff Daniels.  All of them capable actors. This should have been a great film. But it was done in by a terrible script, and sub-par battle re-enactments. The soaring, saccharine music didn't help things either.  Gettysburg is a defining moment in American history.  The men who fought there, Union and Rebel, are heroes.  Their memory has been diminished by this movie.  Take a look at a very famous and common picture from the war.  It shows three Rebels captured at Gettysburg.  It is printed in almost every illustrated history of the war.  The men are lean, mean and almost arrogant in their pose.  Hard men, living on poor rations and forced on long, grueling marches.  Men who worked hard their whole lives and were not afraid of physical labor.  Compare them to the fat, soft looking men portraying the soldiers in this movie.  I don't believe uniforms in 1864  were manufactured in the 4xxxx size most of these ""actors"" required.  These men looked fake, they looked like lazy, beer drinking couch potatos, not the battle hardened Army of Northern Virginia.  My God, several looked out of breath running up Little Round Top. I think they needed oxygen masks off camera!!  The language and gore of battle are also kept to a minimum.  I don't pretend to be a combat veteran, but I know battle is a messy, brutal affair. I have been told many stories by WW II vets.  A bunch of fat boys being thrown in the air after a cannon shot does not portray the sheer brutality of war.  What about the screaming, wounded men littering the battlefield? Forgotten heroes. Men are torn apart by artillery.  There is cowardice and heroism in every army, and it was not shown in this film.  Instead we get long speeches, designed to bring a sentimental tear to our eyes, that never comes, punctuated by phony facial hair.",1098316800,16,1917,4.676646706586826
486183,5,6302548748,"Now I don't know about you, but I preferred this movie over Gods and Generals. I liked how the men in Gettysburg, most notably Jeff Bridges, managed to keep the spirit of men who fought for their beliefs alive.

 Jeff Bridges stars as Joshua Chamberlain, a teacher and scholar, leader of the 20th Maine division and gives a great performance. Other great characters would have to be; Martin Sheen, who should be declared a master of acting as he plays the role of Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Confederate soldiers. I now seriously consider him to be the only one who can acurately portray him, no one else would even come close.

Tom Berenger and Richard Jordan also give very good supporting roles in the movie as the lower captains and officers. Basically all the men who give a talking performance manages to add their little bit to this movie to make it great.

Now even though the movie is about Gettysburg, there are also several other storylines in this four hour movie. My favorite would have to be the Battle of Little Round Top. Bridges and his men are forced to defend the rear of a line of union soldiers at the top of several hills. The confederates have been ordered to try and break through and then flank the unportected remaining forces of the Union army.

As soon as several attacks fail the union soldiers make a desperate charge with nothing but empty guns and bayonets fixed ont their rifles. ""Sir, i'm ordering these confederates around with an empty rifle!"" One of my favorite quotes in that part of the movie.

There are other great reinactments of several battles, but the one that stole the show was when the Confederalists marched toward the town of Gettysburg as thousands of Union soldiers waited for them. I thought that it was very moving for the Confederalists to march with their friends and possibly family members, knowing that most of them might not come back. {The Union forces were firing cannons at them as the walked at least 2 miles over open ground.

Another great scene would have to be when Lee rode into a large group of his men in order to wish them good luck. It was very powerful to see his men cheer him and rush up to shake his hand. A great moment that shows anyone can have a hero to look up to.

Anyway this is one great movie. I guarantee you that you will find yourself wanting to see the entire movie without skiping any scenes, at least if you want to see just how good this movie can get. A powerful and touching film, and It will leave you breathless....",1097798400,5,2517,4.4803493449781655
486184,5,6302548748,"We had the fairly unique experience of visiting Gettysburg Battlefield while on vacation.  We bought the DVD of ""Gettysburg"" at the gift shop, watched it that night, and went back the following day for a more in-depth battlefield tour.

Actually visiting the places where, for example, the 20th Maine made its desperate stand, brought a lot more meaning to the movie.

Jeff Daniels stole the show as the scholar-turned-soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His sidekick, the ""tough old Mick"" Kilrain, who called him ""Colonel, Darlin,"" without being the least bit disrespectful, was perfect. The heart-stopping moment when Chamberlain realizes that his men are out of ammunition and must nonetheless keep the Confederates from reaching the summit of Little Round Top makes the viewer wonder: ""What, in the name of God, would I do in that situation?"" When Chamberlain orders his men to ""fix bayonets,"" and then charge downhill, it's an awesome thing.

I liked Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought that he had the Virginia accent down pretty well for a ""furriner,"" and he carried a weary dignity about him.  It was said of Lee that his men would, and often did, follow him into Hell.  Sheen's portrayal suggested that kind of magnetism.

This isn't a movie to go into without having done your homework first.  It really helps to know something about how the Civil War was going up to that point, who the major players were, and what the main issues were. There are so many characters and so many shifts back and forth that you can get a disoriented ""Who's on First"" kind of feeling. Reading Michael Shaara's book first would also be very helpful.

I found Tom Berenger's portrayal of General Longstreet to be up to his usual high standard, but the makeup people who pasted his beard on did a horrible job.  It made him look like a dimestore Santa.

One note that I found interesting was that the Yankees fought for the Union. Period.  The Confederates, on the other hand, fought for their individual states.  The Virginians, for example, fought for mother, home and family - and the honor of Virginia.  They thought of themselves not as Confederates, or even Americans, but first and foremost, as Virginians.

This movie is not light, mindless entertainment.  It is demanding and emotionally wrenching.  Gettysburg is part of our history - a part of who we are.

This telling of the story is absolutely first-class.",1094774400,14,2427,4.89242053789731
486185,4,6302548748,"Having watched Gettysburg four times and then having gone back and reread Michael Shaara's book, I have come to the conclusion that Maxwell has done an honorable job of translating Shaara's book to film.  However, Martin Sheen's portrail of Robert E Lee is so poorly done that it seriously detracts from the overall satisfaction of the movie.

  Lee was a deeply religious man.  He was very open about his faith in God and considered it to be the central anchor of his life.  Martin Sheen seems to think that if he was religious, that must mean that General Lee had an ethereal look in his eyes and stared off into space a lot.  There are scenes where Sheen's General Lee looks like he is trying to hear voices that are telling him where he left his lunch.  It was very distracting and diminished the enjoyment of the movie considerably.

  General Lee's horse, Traveler, was by all accounts a magnificent animal.  I suspect that Martin Sheen is not very comfortable around horses because the animal in the movie can't be much bigger than a shetland pony.  There is a scene toward the end of the movie, just before the disasterous Rebel charge up Cemetary Ridge, where Sheen is riding Traveler in front of the cheering soldiers.  He looks less like a great general and more like an uncomfortable dude whose head bounces like a bobblehead doll.

  Had this portrail not been so bad, I would gladly have give the movie five stars.  The scenes of Chamberland and the 20th Maine on Little Round Top are inspiring.  The portrail of the first and second day buildup to the battle and Pickett's charge are well done and follow Shaara's book faithfully enough.  At nearly four hours, the movie is long, but this really didn't bother me, so was the actual battle, after all.

  I can easily recommend the movie to others, I only wish that Sheen had had a better insight into his portrail of Lee.",1094342400,5,1886,4.597597597597598
486186,4,6302548748,"Gettysburg is a fantastic movie and probably the definitive portrayal of the key Civil War engagement. Everything here is bang on the money - the action scenes are beautifully staged, the acting performances are spot on, and attention to detail is eye-candy to history buffs. Jeff Daniels in particular is absolutely fantastic as the Union officer who, against the odds, wins one of the battle's pivotal clashes. Sam Elliot adds a welcome dash of colour, too. Inexplicably, however, the film takes a sharp nose-dive in the middle when at some point Tom Berenger (GeneraL Longstreet) and Martin Sheen (General Lee) struggle vainly against a dialogue so lumpen and pompous that they both seem about to turn into marble. (Robert Duvall is in Gods & Generals a superior Robert E. Lee to Martin Sheen). And the inclusion of an observer British officer who struts around (complete with tea-cup and supercilious demeanour), is an appallingly two-dimensional, badly-acted parody of Englishness, and the movie suddenly lurches from masterful big-screen movie to sub-standard TV bilge in seconds. Gettysburg picks up again with the Little Round Top clash, when Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) first repulses a whooping Confederate attack and then, out of ammo, charges the enemy with fixed bayonets, driving the rebs from the scene and taking loads of prisoners. Hurrah!
For my money, however - and I seem to be alone in thinking this - sequel Gods & Generals is a far superior Maxwell movie, with even better acting performances, less synthetic-sounding music, grittier battle sequences and lacks the stiffness and that occasionally mars Gettysburg.

486188,4,6302548748,"'Pro-Confederate bias is pretty standard revisionism'? I question the reviewer who wrote that critique. So often in today's world of ""dumbed down"" history the opposite is true - slavery is often the only reason given for why the civil war was fought. This is a disservice both to history and to our educational system.

 Thankfully, ""Gettysburg"" is at least fair enough to look at both sides and not blithely jump on the politically correct bandwagon. Yes, Lincoln wanted to free the slaves and many in the Union fought for that reason, but many did not, just as many in the South were not fighting specifically to defend it. As a southern prisoner of war in the movie states, ""I don't care much about the 'darkies' one way or the other....I'm fightin for my 'rats'"".

 The movie itself is gripping and rarely boring. My one criticism are the occasional preachy scenes (such as Chamberlain and Kilrain discussing the black race), but there aren't that many and it's almost to be expected in today's cinema.

 Sheen is excellent as Lee and Berenger decent as Longstreet (could they have redone his beard, perhaps?)....but as others have said, Jeff Daniels steals the show as Chamberlain. But perhaps the most powerful single scene in the movie is performed by Richard Jordan as Armistead, when speaking to Longstreet about his very close friend Winfield Hancock who is now commanding part of the Union army just a couple miles away. His reluctance to fight someone as close as a brother to him is certainly a theme often discussed regarding the civil war (brother vs. brother, friend vs. friend) and Jordan does a perfect job bringing this unfortunate paradox to life.

 Cinematography and score are first rate. You really don't want the movie to end. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.....you might even learn something too.",1091059200,7,1837,4.903225806451613
486204,5,6302548748,"Turner Entertainment's 3+ hour film on the battle of Gettysburg; the turning point of the Civil War where over 53,000 men lost their lives after 3 days of fighting near a small Pennsylvania town in July of 1863. The film has a good script, strong cast, and great cinematography. A good film to be watched by the whole family.

  The film primarily covers the strategic aspects of the battle through action scenes and character studies. Almost all of the political, strategic, and tactical aspects at play in this battle are covered by the film. The characters depicted are primarily the Union and Confederate officers who participated in the battle. This allows the viewer to identify with the characters while not losing any sense of the events in the battle. The audience is enlightened to both the confusions and revelations generals such as Lee, Pickett, Bufford, and others experienced through the course of the battle. All of the actors delivered impeccable performances: especially Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain.

  In terms of action, the film is very meticulous as to detail thanks to the many Civil War reenactment societies that participated in its making. One draw back is that the battle scenes are somewhat sterile and unrealistic: unlike the PC carnage shown in the film, victims of grape shot and shrapnel didn't simply fly in the air and fall down again as if they were making a touchdown at the Super Bowl. The Napoleanic tactics of marching in close formations to within less than 50 yards of the enemy usually resulted in bodies being butchered in every horrible way: leaving only blood, guts, and loose limbs on the ground. The film's sensibilities are understandable though, it was made for TV and its format allows for a wider audience of all ages.

  This is a great movie that satisfies on many levels. History buffs will like it because of its detail while others will like it because of its deep character studies. This is a film to be enjoyed by the whole family.",1090972800,4,1989,4.843657817109144
486205,5,6302548748,"I absolutely LOVE this movie.  Based on the bestselling novel 'The Killer Angels' by Michael Shaara, Gettysburg is an engaging and [MOSTLY accurate] retelling of the events surrounding what was probably the most major battle of the War of Northern Agression (no offense to anyone, I AM a southerner, but I harbor no serious prejudices toward anyone).  Some minor details, such as Chamberlain's position during the battle are slightly off, but most of the historical action is dead on.  Martin Sheen delivers an excellent performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee.  Although this movie was released earlier, 'Gods and Generals' by Jeff Shaara (same name as the book, and Michael Shaara's son) precedes Gettysburg in historical order.  Recommended to anyone interested in the American Civil War and history buffs alike.",1090022400,5,809,5.24031007751938

I thought that Sheen did a fair job at playing the great General Robert E. Lee, but he is no match for the outstanding performance of Robert Duvall. I like Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, who was also from my native state, South Carolina. Jeff Danials did a spectacular job in this film as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in Gettysburg as well in Gods and Generals. The effort these actors put in to this movie are so dramatic, it takes your breath away to see these men, in fact, you don't see Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, or Jeff Danials, you see Robert E. Lee, Jamse Longstreet, and Joshua Chamberlain. But I must say, if you are going to watch Gettysburg, you mite want to watch Gods and Generals first.",1088812800,,857,4.3625
486207,5,6302548748,"Everyone involved in the making of GETTYSBURG has absolutely every right to be proud of what they have contributed to our understanding of those three terrible days of fierce fighting during the Civil War. Under director Ronald Maxwell's unflinching yet sympathetic command, GETTYSBURG more than recreates the military strategies and errors that took place that summer in 1863. He puts a human face on the thinking and feeling of all those who took part in that conflagration.
All the performances are brilliant. In no particular order, Martin Sheen was perfect as the brooding, somber Robert E. Lee. Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang were compelling as Lt. General Longstreet and Maj. General Pickett, respectively. In what I believe was his final performance, Richard Jordan capped a terrific career as Brig. General Armistead. Even the extras were incredibly convincing!
But what is at the heart of this film is the truism that ""Heroes don't make history; history makes heroes""--and nowhere is that belief more accurately expressed than in the plight of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, as intensely portrayed by Jeff Daniels. Sorely outnumbered, actually absurdly outnumbered, Col. Chamberlain and his unit was given the daunting task of defending the Union's flank. A former schoolteacher, Chamberlain drew upon his training AND his knowledge of military history to outmanuever and outpsyche the enemy while, more importantly, keeping the morale of his own men in check. The result was a devestating blow to the Confederacy which marked a truning point in the battle and the war. Daniels was nothing less than flawless as Col. Chamberlain. And like I said before, just about everything else was remarkable, too.",1087516800,,1707,5.302583025830258

486209,5,6302548748,"Having viewed this film several times, and compelled to see it in 70mm on the Big Screen a dozen more, I suppose you could say I am entirely enthusiastic about it.  And you would be correct.  There are few films that parallel in quality the book upon which they are based...""Gettysburg"" does the Pulitzer Prize-Winning ""The Killer Angels"" justice...and then some.  On first viewing, one cannot help but be amazed by the scope of the drama, supported as it is by thousands of Civil War re-enactors without whom such a feat would not be possible.
This film brings all that is important about the great struggle to define our nation, through the bloodiest conflict in American history, and on our on soil, into a sharper focus. It covers major issues and personalities, as does Michael Shaara's book, and shows how men could be so devoted to a struggle on such a grand scale, and face it with seeming fearlessness.
If this is just your start in considering the Civil War, or a waystation on your way to try to understand why it continues to compel many to study, or try to experience some face of it, you'll do well to direct your personal journey through this film.
At one point, two academics (Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Strong Vincent, of Bowdoin and Harvard Colleges), are face to face, and Vincent says, ""Now, we'll see how professors fight.""  It was that kind of conflict.  All of America was involved, in some way, and while we are now involved in a greater conflict, one seemingly more abstract at times, this great film will bring the reality, the glory, the horror of armed conflict into closer focus.  It happened here, on American soil, and men who felt as brothers sometimes found themselves just a short distance across from one another, commanding men under them to certain death to make a point--that there would be henceforth one nation, or two.
There is hope in this film...and when you find it, you will have more of a sense of what it means to be an American--and it will change what you thought or felt.",1085011200,4,2026,4.645251396648045
486210,5,6302548748,"I feel Gettysburg shows the true spirit of the Confederate Army during the Civil War.  It shows that two opposite command styles of Robert E. Lee, and Gen. Longstreet.  It makes these commanders and leaders human to us.  It also shows the devotion to Gen. Lee which made underfed, bare-footed, and uneducated men who were the salt of the earth, follow the Gen into battle against larger numbers and still be successful.
  What struck me the most was when Gen Lee realized that he had made a bad decision at Gettysburg, which cost them the battle and took the blame upon himself.  He appeared to understand that Gen. Longstreet's plan to flank would have been successfull.
  It also gave us an insight to the brillance of Joshuah L. Chamberlain in going from school teacher to Colo in the 20th Maine and leading those men into a successful defense of Little Round Top with a shortage of ammunition and men.",1083369600,3,905,4.647798742138365
486211,4,6302548748,"To understand this film one first has to come to the understanding that trying to fit the entire battle of Gettysburg in one film is impossable. The battle was 3 days long spread out over a very large area involving over 200,000 men. This film does not try to tell that entire story. Instead what the filmakers have done is take Michael Shaara's historical novel and literary masterpiece 'Killer Angels', and turned it into a first rate film.
What the film Gettysburg does (and what the book it's based on did) is view the battle from personal perspectives. In this case the perspectives of General James Longstreet and his commanders on the Confederate side and Col Joshua Chamberlain, General Winfield Hancock and General John Buford on the Federal side. We see the battle through their eyes and thus we're able to see it in a human perspective. While this make the battle easier for us to follow, it does leave out certain important areas of the battle such as Culp's Hill.
In the end however we do get a film that captures the spirit of the men who fought at Gettysburg and a film that surprisingly keeps very close to the book it's based on. There are historical inaccuracies of course in the film and a few myths are reinforced here and there but for the most part these do not detract to much from the film.
So sit back and enjoy this fine film and if you enjoy it enough that you want to learn more about Gettysburg then pick up Edwin Coddington's or Stephen Sears's book on the battle. Both have written first rate books that cover the entire Gettysburg campaign in one volume.",1083283200,2,1586,4.548951048951049

The man that wrote the book, the men who worked to get this film made over a period of 10 years and the re-enactors are worthy of the highest praise for a truly memorable piece of work which United States citizens of today can be proud.  The usual fair from Hollywood makes us ashamed and sickened at the garbage they turn out.  Thankfully, GETTYSBURG is a masterpiece where truth, honor, valor, history, hard work, devotion, bravery, morality and patriotism are shown for the way it really was not as our history books present the history of the War Between the States!",1082764800,3,764,4.595588235294118

I was also impressed by Richard Jordan(General Armistead), Patrick Gorman(General Hood) and Stephen Lang (General Pickett) who, by the way, did alot better as General Pickett than General Jackson in ""Gods and Generals"". I disagree with those who feel that Robert Duvall did better as General Lee than Martin Sheen. We see more of Lee in ""Gettysburg"" than we do in ""Gods and Generals"" and therefore we get to know Lee  better in ""Gettysburg"" and Sheen did a great job of being the great General Robert Edward Lee, the best Army Commander America has ever seen. The scenes at Pickett's Charge are nothing short than stunning...! When that enourmous line of 15 000 Confederates advance across that field only to be slaughtered by the awaiting Yankees... Horrific.
In the end, the battle at Gettysburg decided the outcome of the Civil War. If General Lee had won again at Gettysburg, the Confederacy might have won the war. One can never know, but Lee's army never quite recovered after the defeat at Gettsyburg.
To put in General Lee's words: ""Too bad. Too bad... Oh! Too bad!!""

I take the opposite view that Duvall was at best a mediocre Lee hardly showing any emotion at all.  I felt virtually nothing for the man in his performance as Lee.  He also is not on the screen very much.  We really never get to know him or like him.  On the other hand, Sheen as Lee is someone who truly has emotions, he cares about his troops, we see him in a human light and we like him. We see more of him in Gettysburg and we get to know him.  How can one forget the emotions of ""Reviewing the Troops"".

Martin Sheen is the wrong actor to do R. E. Lee but this unconvincing portrayal is not a fatal flaw. The acting, even where license is taken with the historical truth, does accurately reflect the people involved in the struggle.

Seeing Gods & Generals on DVD led me to Gettysburg, made 11 years earlier. I expected shoddy production values & a cheaply done movie when compared to G&G. Not so. I watched a old Robert Duvall playing Gen. Robert E. Lee morph into a younger Martin Sheen . The difference was neligible, but the most amusing moments in a decidedly not amusing movie were General Sheen gathering himself to attention to salute which he did a dozen times or so during the battle.
  The Battle of Gettyburg was fought over a period of three days in numerous locations in the area. This movie covered three important engagements culminating in what is know as ""Pickett's Charge"". After day one the Confederacy was at it's high water mark. By the end of day three they had suffered reverses & losses of men they could not replace. This signaled the beginning of the end for the rebels although the war continued for almost two more years. The outcome was inevitable when it became obvious that Union would not stop & would not negotiate. Thus the war after Gettysburg was one of attrition.
  I considered myself well educated on Gettysburg & the Civil War in general. That I learned so much from this movie pleased me & I say well done.",1077235200,2,1391,4.619433198380567

It gives credit where credit is due and lets the blame fall where it may to both the North and to the South. The fate of the Union is at stake.

While I agree some of the speeches are a bit heavy handed, they are out weighed by the fine acting and scope of the hard choices made on both sides of the line. If nothing else this movie has made me delve further into the life of my great grandfather who fought  for the union and survived. The movie is not about who was right and who was wrong, it is about human beings struggling with the battles that lie within all of us, and the choices we make. Since watching it I have become more interested in the events of that time and I have been doing a lot of reading about it. Even though I would be termed a ""yankee"" I am proud of the valor, bravery and sacrfice on both sides.

486230,5,6302548748,"First off, anyone gripping about the small budget effect of battle about this film needs to STOP and understand it WAS a small budget film.  This film was NEVER EVER intended for Theatrical release.  Only, the power of the film, demanded it be shown on big screen.  Michael Shaara's book ""Killer Angels"" on of the most moving look of the men that set the nightmare of Gettysburg into action, was given a new life with Ted Turner's group.  It was created to be run on TNT, his cable/satellite station in two parts.  So yes, the casting went with actors more in line with Telly than Theatre, yes, it had to cut corners on budget.  Does that affect the quality of the film?  No one bit.  Anyone grumping about the cannons not recoiling is nitpicking.
And for people fusing about 5000 Civil War re-enactors (including Ted Turner manning one of the non-recoiling cannons) being unpaid.  Well, ASK THEM.  The re-enactors thought this was a chance of a lifetime to record what they do annually anyway!
The movie was intended to address the personal side of the war, the friendships torn apart by deferences in belief, the frustration, the futility.
Richard Jordon's Emmy nominated performance alone is worth the price.  With fine work by numerous supporting actors such as Sam Elliot and Stephan Lang.
So one should not grip about what it is not - and was never intended to be - but appreciate the fine effort that is it.  One of the most moving looks at such a tragic period in history.",1074038400,7,1480,4.628352490421456

Although wordy, much of the dialog was gleaned from the letters written & saved from the time, & people did & do speak as they write. But by being less bloody & gory, its makes the film viewable by the very young, who truly need to be the ones to learn he 'lessons' of the civil war. The remaining problems still need to be resolved, & we must learn to forgive both the North & South for the transgressions of the other, & move on as a stronger, more powerful nation, respecting the views of each.

486265,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is perhaps the best attempt by any film to capture a single battle from beginning to end. It is not a movie for everyone since there is no artificially-embedded love story (as in. ""Pearl Harbor""), and in fact, there are no women in this movie at all.  It sets out to depict the largest battle ever fought on the American continent.  Its success is the product of the deliberate choice of the director to respect the source material, namely one of the finest historical war novels ever written, ""The Killer Angels"", by Michael Shaara.
Gettysburg is a battle of superlatives.  It was the largest and bloodiest encounter battle of the Civil War, adding up the three days between July 1 and July 3, 1863, and it tore the heart out of the Lee's Army of Northern Virginia..  It is also the most controversial battle, generating more than its share of debates over decisions and tactics.  Was Lee off his game at Gettysburg, as Shaara suggests?  Or, as other historians argue, was the battle lost by ""Old Pete"" Longstreet's case of the ""slows"" on July 2 (the attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top) and July 3 (Pickett's Charge)?  Longstreet's postwar memoirs lay the blame for Pickett`s Charge squarely at Lee's feet, but since Longstreet joined the Republican party after the war, many Southerners are quick to blame him for Lee's defeat.
Shaara's book, and therefore the film, makes choices in this debate.  Shaara sides with Longstreet (aptly played by Tom Beringer), who is depicted as a thoughtful, reluctant warrior who vocally opposes the sanguinary frontal assaults launched by Lee on July 2nd and July 3rd .  (For a different perspective, I highly recommend Noah Trudeau's latest book, ""Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage."")
It is a delight to see the musty daguerreotypes of Civil War leaders come to life as living, breathing characters.  For the Confederates, Tom Berringer's Longstreet is tops, followed by Confederate generals ""Lo"" Armistead (Richard Jordan) and Stephen Lang `s amazing George Pickett, a stunning contrast to Lang's later alabaster imitation of Christ as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson in ""Gods and Generals.""  These are interesting, complex people, and ""Gettysburg"" even manages a sense of humor.  The debate on Darwin between Pickett and Armistead is funny, concluding with Pickett defying any Southern gentleman to openly claim that ""Robert E. Lee is descended from an ape."" On the Union side, there is Jeff Daniels as the bookish hero Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten cavalry general Buford, and Brian Mallon's pugnacious General Winfield Scott Hancock.
Some die-hard grognards have complained that ""Gettysburg"" glosses over details of the battle.  But Shaara, and the film, were right to concentrate on the highlights: the initial skirmish and ultimate Union rout on July 1, the confused battle for Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, and the against-all-odds defense of Little Round Top on July 2 by Joshua Chamberlain's (Jeff Daniels) 20th Maine; and, of course, Pickett's Charge.  Massive volumes have been written about just one day of the three day battle, and any film which tried to cover it all would be a ponderous bore.
The few speeches in the movie are necessary, I suppose, to explain the larger motives for the war.  Jeff Daniels' Chamberlain has to give the obligatory Abolitionist speech, and Armistead trys to explain the Southern ""Cause"" to the English camp follower Freemantle just before Pickett's Charge.  The few speeches in `Gettysburg""  hint at the malignancy that emerges full flower in ""Gods and Generals"" (written by a different Shaara) in which the camera's pause on any character become the excuse for a five to ten minutes of pious blather.
The flaws of the film are few.  One major flaw is Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee as an unblinking somnambulist, whose approach to strategy is by mumbling ""it is God's will"" as officers rush up with dispatches.  Robert Duvall's more animated Lee is the only (and I mean only improvement) that ""Gods and Generals"" has on ""Gettysburg.""  Sheen's wide-eyed robot Lee is hard to square with the historical brilliance of Lee at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville, and contemporary accounts of Lee as a witty conversationalist, a battlefield gambler, and with an eye for the ladies.
Ted Turner's use of thousands of amateur reenactors to stage the battle is both a blessing and a curse, but mostly a blessing.  Let's face it - the authentically-decked out and equipped amateur soldiers look far more like the real thing than the standard Spanish rent-an-army employed in similar epics such as ""Waterloo.""  However, I suspect that the troops in the movie, particularly on the Southern side, are cleaner, neater, better fed and older (lots of retired folks are reenactors) than the actual participants in the battles.  (A common observation of the time was that you could smell Lee's troops approaching before you would see them).  The other problem with reenactors is they object to having their limbs and heads blown off, or torsos reduced to bloody pulp by cannon balls.  This is not ""Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"" - these soldiers, even when blasted by cannon, die clean deaths, and do not convey the historical eyewitness accounts of the horror, not to mention thousands of corpses set out in the hot July sun.  But these are very minor quibbles.  This is as good a re-enactment using real people as you can expect.
I recommend ""Gettysburg"" for historical movie fans, and do not forget the wonderful Ken Burns' documentary, ""The Civil War.""",1064966400,223,5579,5.029315960912052

Of course, what could you expect from a movie that has cameos of Ted Turner and Senator Byrd? The re-enactments of the fighting is pretty good.  Although you do find yourself wondering where everyone is.  The movie doesn't really convey the idea of a titanic clash of 'Armies' when they only show a few dozen men at a time.  I don't know, maybe they had to stay under a tight budget and couldn't afford a lot of extras. One thing, that I doubt would have cost them and would have made the movie immensely more believable, would have been to replace Martin Sheen.  Mr. Sheen played Robert E. Lee the same way he played his part in 'Apocalypse Now'.  It's hard to understand how the eye rolling, mumbling, bumbling and almost incoherent General Lee that Mr. Sheen portrayed could have inspired anyone to fight.  Much less tired, hungry and barefoot Confederate soldiers. Like I said, it's OK. But, wait till you find it on sale to buy it. Or better yet, rent it.

The only possible improvement I can imagine is a different casting of General Lee.  Martin Sheen doesn't look anything like him, and his accent was nothing close to Virginian (and I'm not even a Southerner).  I agree with the other reviewers who've said Robert Duvall makes a better Lee.
All the other castings were perfect.  4 hours isn't long enough...you'll find yourself hating for it to end!  I really can't recommend this movie enough!",1064275200,3,875,4.528662420382165

Everyone was going on and on with long speeches which told a lot but were way to boring.  Martin Sheen was a terrible Robert E. Lee.  His acent was not belivable at all, he sounded more like he was from South Boston rather than Virginia.  And what was with his hat?  Wasn't he carrying it most of the movie?  Did they pay someone a lot to do his hair and that is why he almost never wore it?  I am a big Civil War person and have a great interest in the time but this movie was soo long that I thought I actually spent the 3 days the battle took.

Every year I see it, I watch the First day of the battle on July 1st, the second day of the battle on July 2nd and the third day on the third of July, in keeping with the pace of the events.  I have watched it numerous times on other occasions since I was 8.  This movie captures the true spirit of the Civil War like none other.  It perfectly portrays the generals who were there.  Lee, Longstreet, Hood, Armistead, Hancock, Buford, Reynolds and especially Pickett.  Not to forget of course Colonel Chamberlain. In the many Civil War books I have read, this movie is one of the most accurate historical movies I have seen.  In fact, it even keeps quite close to the book it was made from, The Kiler Angels by Michael Shaara.  The books by the Michael and Jeff Shaara are all must reads.  The battles do not add unnecessary action but show the desperate effort of Pickett's Charge and Chamberlain's pivotal defense of Little Round Top magnificently.  One unnecessary addition, however, was having Chamberlain witness Pickett's Charge and have that conversation with General Hancock.  Despite the length, this movie holds your interest quite well.  The emotion of each of the generals is portrayed so well.  The sulleness of Longstreet, the serenity of Lee, the flamboyant Pickett, the philosophical Chamberlain and the calm Armistead are the starts of this film.  I have personally been to Gettysburg 14 times and still have not seen everything there and feel that this movie so well portrays such a complex battle.  Gettysburg, Gods and Generals are must-see movies while The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals and all the other Shaara books are must-read books.",1059264000,4,1714,4.802047781569966

The emphasis on the Chamberlains of the 20th Maine and the long distance relationships of Gen. Lew Armistead and Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock introduce a human dimension into an inhumane story.
Although Martin Sheen is a bit suspect as Robert E. Lee, Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as James Longstreet and Richard Jordan as Lew Armistead combine with others to carry the film.

486293,5,6302548748,"Although one of our fellow Amazon customers has praised this film for its ""tastefully done battle scenes"" which are to be commended for lack of blood and gore, our friend misses a crucial point. Battle is about blood and gore, and about death and destruction. Wars are ugly--arguably necessary from time to time but grotesque in their very premise. Organized  killing should not be sanitized, for to do so mimimizes its horror. If we are to make and watch films about war, then we should watch the truth. Only then will the cinema remind us of the cost of war and the need, when possible, to avoid it. To sanitize battle scenes in the hope that viewers will not be offended is to diminish the sacrifice made by those who really died in the real war being depicted. I fault not the film so much as the reviewer who evidently wants his movie wars to entertain, rather than to  profoundly disturb.",1057708800,6,894,4.546583850931677
486294,4,6302548748,"What they included in this movie was exciting and intense.  Unfortunately, what they left out was, in some cases, more important than what they put in.  Three fields of battle (one for each day) were highlighted in this movie: the initial engagement on the Chambersburg Pike, the 20th Maine's repulse of  the Alabamans at the base of Little Round Top, and Pickett's Charge.
The exclusions were baffling.  How in the world could a movie calling itself ""Gettysburg"" completely ignore the most controversial event of the entire three days?  Dan Sickles' unilateral decision to abandon his position on Little Round Top might as well have never happened.  And since there was no Sickles, there could be no heroics by Warren.  There's a statue of the man on Little Round Top, shouldn't he perhaps be included in the movie?
The Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield were only mentioned in passing.  It was said that the Wheatfield was so full of dead soldiers that you could walk across it without touching the ground.  How could this not merit something more than a throw away line by Longstreet (Tom Berenger)?
You could argue that the movie was already four hours long, so you had to cut something.  And you would be right.  But the dialogue was populated with too much character development dialogue, speeches, and sermons.  How many times did we have to hear about the Armistead - Hancock friendship before they beat that horse to death?  OK, OK, brother against brother, we get it - move on.  Was it really necessary to show us that Pickett was a raconteur more than once?  Love him or hate him, Dan Sickles' story is far more interesting.
Neither the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top nor Pickett's Charge would have suffered from some time compression.  Both were excellently done.  But I would have gladly traded one or two Alabama assaults, and a whole bunch of drumming, walking Virginians for something of what transpired at the Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield.
I haven't even mentioned the Slaughter Pen and the Valley of Death, Spangler's Spring, Culp's Hill, Cemetery Hill or Custer at the East Cavalry Battlefield.  But then again, the movie didn't much address them either.  To their credit, they did say the words ""Devil's Den"" a couple of times.
As for historic accuracy, I have to say they were right on.  I used my battlefield tour guidebook as a supplement to understanding the movie, and the flow of the battles depicted agreed to the guidebook.
I can't speak for the movie's adherence to ""Killer Angels"", having never read the book, but the movie was called ""Gettysburg"", which is a wide scope indeed.  Despite these disappointments, I have to say that overall I really do like this movie.",1055721600,7,2709,4.82034632034632

The movie is a bit long but if you have a rainy afternoon it is the perfect movie.
The DVD is also fairly well put together.  A good amount of extras, the best being the documentary on the making of the movie.

For those thinking of watching this for the first time, remember that it is long, and very very accurate.  Think of how butchered the film would be if they crammed three days of battles into less than four hours!
What this means is, you don't have a film littered with love stories that never happened, or one main hero out to save the day.  Instead you have non-modernized speech, strategy-talk that might not be fully relevant to upcoming scenes, and facial hair that is so amazing it looks fake.
I've felt you can always tell a film is accurate when it seems just the opposite.  I remember seeing scenes where charecters seem fake, or out of place, only to hear the stories of the charecters later from my history buff Dad.
My Junior year of college I got the opertunity to go with my father to Gettysburg to see the battlefield.  I was amazed at how the directors were able to cover all the monuments and still pull off a realistic look to the movie.
I remember touring the museum, seeing photo's of soldiers.  I was amazed at how dead on their portrayals were.  I read many reviews from those who claim the actors look unrealistic.  I ask them simply to view the end credits where they show the actual person followed by the actor.  Jeff Daniels as Chamberlin is almost eerie.  And I can see where the directors went with Civil War reinactors, bringing their own outfits, instead of average extras.
In the end, you can't find a more accurate movie when it comes to Civil War history.  Even though it's four hours, you'll find yourself not only entertained, but informed.
Any part that may seem confusing is there for a reason.  Not so that you can come on here and run your mouth about how bad it is, but so you do something completely foriegn to people today.  Crack a book.",1052697600,2,2019,4.421621621621622

This is my favorite movie of all time.  Even though, it is 4.5 hours, it is well worth it.  Sitting there watching it, you get sucked into the time period.  You can't stop watching it.

486340,5,6302548748,"This is one excellent movie which takes the time to develope and show the true drama of what was a turning moment in the Civil War.  Despite all the legions of books written on the Civil War, few good movies have been attempted.  I think some of the bad reviews this movie receives are from those who have little knowledge of the history and just get bored because they can't follow what's going on.  Pity that they can't widen their minds a bit to enjoy what this film has to offer.  Also I think people are so use to politically correct messages in movies today that they can't appreciate something that does not do that for a change.  Gettysburg tries to tell a story of courage, tragedy and humanity during a pivital moment in American history.  It seeks to do no more or less than this.  Some may find the acting a little preachy or stiff, but that was they way people comported themselves 130 years ago.  Having been a one time Union re-enactor myself I can appreciate what these guys did to make this movie.  None of the re-enactors in this production were paid for their efforts.  They did this for the love of the hobby and to leave a lasting monument for the Civil War for future generations to see and enjoy.  The movie stays close to Michael Sharra's original book ""Killer Angels"" with only the tile changed to Gettysburg to make it more marketable to audiences.  Ted Turner financed this project, and while it might be considered vanity on his part,  the end result is a classic of its kind.  I only wish he could have paid the re-enactors for their fine efforts.  As it was he got a great movie for a fraction of the costs.  The current production, ""Gods and Generals"" done by Sharra's son Jeff continues the saga in the
earlier period of the war.  The new movie is fine, but probably not quite as good as Gettysburg.  Its too bad the DVD version does not contain the director's cut which was offered as a special collector's edition a few years ago on VHS.  Still, this standard version is good and contains a lot of nice features to enhance the enjoyment of the movie.",1047600000,,2084,4.436842105263158
486341,4,6302548748,"I saw the movie 'Gettysburg' a few years back and thought it was very good but not great. I felt that there was something missing, that it really didn't have a beginning or a fitting ending. Of course, I know the beginning and the end result of the Civil War itself, but, still, I felt the movie was not quite complete. That is, until the release of the pre-quel to Gettysburg - 'Gods and Generals.' 'God's', although much more dramatic and not quite as action-packed as Gettysburg, is a fitting beginning to what will hopefully/eventually become a trilogy (although ""Gods"" needs to be much more balanced and much less biased against the North - plenty of great scenes left in the vault, so far unseen), with the third installment (Last Full Measure) due (?) sometime in the not too distant future.

Gettysburg is historically correct - NOT politically correct -  which is so prominent in most of today's movies, music, tv shows, news reports, and everything else the media has control of. It shows this most horrific of all battles ever fought on U. S. soil to be so accurate (at least according to the history books I've read) that 'Gettysburg' could be used as a text book/documentary for American history classes. I feel the biggest reason for this is due to the fact that re-enactors have played such a prominent role in the making of both of these films, making sure that they're historically correct right down to the buttons on the uniforms worn by the fighting men (yes, yes, I KNOW about the facial hair, but those aren't re-enactors!). And the battle scenes are as realistic as can possibly be done. When you watch the men during Pickett's charge, and see the anguished look on the general's face during the aftermath, one gets the feeling of actually witnessing the carnage that took place.

And the Little Round Top scene will get your heart beating just as it must have beat in the men who were there. Truly gripping.

I have such a greater, clearer understanding of the Civil War due to both movies being so historically correct. The men on both sides who fought in this war are no longer just old pictures in a history book, or silly 1950's b-movie style characters, but real men who fought and died horrible deaths. I wish more historical epics would use re-enactors in the movie making process. They truly bring the past to life.

Do I recommend Gettysburg? Most definitely! Before seeing Gods and Generals, I would have given it a rating of 4. Now, however, a 5 rating seems too low! And I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel to both movies to complete the trilogy!

By the way, I know that there is an extended version 'director's cut' of Gettysburg out there, as I have seen it on TBS. Why is this not available on DVD?

Also, I would absolutely love to see a movie giving the civilians of the town of Gettysburg's point of view. Many folks do not realize what they went through during (and for months after) the battle. Every bit as exciting as the battle itself!

One more thing, if you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and

(A) take a trip to Gettysburg to see for yourself the awesome  battlefields and still-intact town. And it's within an hour from Antietam and an hour and a half from Harper's Ferry. It would be a vacation steeped in history.

(B) Go to a Civil re-enactment and see for yourself the excitement of battle.

Thank you to all involved for bringing our history to life accurately!",1046563200,,3426,4.598360655737705
486342,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" represents that rare occasion in the movies where the filmmakers are painstaking in their attempts to get all of their facts right and still make a watchable movie.  And though you can quibble about a few of the dtetails, they succeed quite well.  The movie is based on the hugely popular novel, ""The Killer Angles,"" which placed dialog in the mouths of the leaders who fought the battle and breathed life back into the legends.  The movies is quite faithful to the book, and places its emphasis on Maine Colonel Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) as well as Confedrate Generals Lee (Martin Sheen) and Longstreet (Tom Berriger).
The DVD version of the movie places the whole 254 minutes on one double-sided disk.  The film looks terrific and there are a number of extras, including a ""Making Of"" sequence and a documentary of the battle itself.  There are also battlefield maps to help the viewer and audio commentary by the filmakers.  If you add it all up, it makes for one great package for any devoted Civil War buff and even those less committed who merely want to understand their history better.",1046563200,31,1114,4.806282722513089
486343,1,6302548748,"Gettysburg and its director Ronald F. Maxwell proudly wear their ""historical accuracy"" on their sleeves.  The result?  The story moves like it really is unfolding second-for-second, the characters yak on and on about inconsequential details, and the central narrative thrust is -- well, there isn't one.
I don't think I've ever been as bored by any war film.  Even historical essays make for a more exciting experience.  Maxwell's characters refer endlessly to small details, yet we are never told what those details mean in the grand scheme of things.  Worst of all, there is never any conflict -- the root of all works of drama.  The stakes are low, there is endless talk and little action, and when the battle scenes do occur, they are perhaps the most lifeless ever filmed.  The charge down the hill, for example, was referred to as a suicidal gesture, yet the Union soldiers simply seem to waltz right through their enemy without any sense of danger.  Maxwell simply has no idea how to either write or direct a good, tense dramatic scene.
Miserable acting caps the whole deal off.  Martin Sheen has never looked more ridiculous as here, ironically, where he plays Robert E. Lee, one of the most charismatic generals in U.S. history and certainly one of the Civil War's figureheads.  Tom Berenger's performance could have been given by any number of bit players.  Even on the music front the film is an utter failure.  The usually resourceful Randy Edelman's score somehow sounds entirely anachronistic, possibly due to a generic orchestral arrangement without specific flavour, and there is entirely too much of it, as if Maxwell is trying to rely on the music to generate some kind of interest.  And he is -- trying, that is, and failing miserably.
I feel insulted when this film is compared to -- and, horrifically, sometimes even cited above -- the 1989 Civil War classic Glory, which featured an immortal performance from Denzel Washington and astonishing writing, directing, cinematography, editing, sound, and music.  And Glory took a little over two hours to say oceans more about the Civil War than Gettysburg does in its entire four-hour running length.  Don't even rent this, unless you're a fan of gross ineptitude and historical accuracy above dramatic interest.  This is as bad as filmmaking gets.",1046563200,18,2315,4.974025974025974
486344,4,6302548748,"Gettsyburg is too historical to grab the casual viewer, but this isn't North and South after all.  At the same time, many Civil War buffs can see all the omissions here, as the epic three day battle is reduced to three pivotal events.  Despite this, Gettysburg is a must-see for those interested in the Civil War and history in general.  The battle scenes are quite good at times, and the larger issues are explored as well, albeit in some overlong scenes of philosophizing around the campfire.
Martin Sheen is an acquired taste as Lee, but he does portray the general's temperament pretty accurately.  Lee was an aggressive general, and Sheen plays him as a stubbornly willed man who means to take on ""those people"" in a direct assault, despite the risk of disaster.  Tom Berenguer plays Longstreet as the calm voice of reason and devil's advocate, with his continued urgings to Lee to ""go to the right"".
Other good performances include the ever-crusty Sam Elliot as Union cavalryman John Buford, Richard Jordan as Confederate brigadier Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as Pickett.  Jeff Daniels is the citizen/soldier Joshua Chamberlain who has to hold off the enemy at Little Round Top, and he plays him as a sensitive yet resolute individual.
As a film this could have been edited and scripted better, the battle scenes won't satisfy everyone and so much is left out.

Most of the scenes do appear to be alright, visually, but I found a problem with roughly 25% of the scenes. As I mentioned, they're either too dark, and even blurry in some cases. The contrast between scenes with sunlight and scenes with little light is incredibly harsh. Even if you have all the lights turned off while watching this film, you'll still have a hard time making out details in the darker scenes.

Visually, the film looks more dated than it should be. It was filmed in 1992 if I remember correctly, but it looks as if it were filmed in 1975, at least in some scenes! I would suggest that this film needs to be visually remastered and re-released in the future. The blu-ray quality did not meet my standards.",1045440000,,896,4.4969325153374236

The acting in this movie was top notch, although I was a little put off by some of the fake beards, but oh well.  The battle scenes in this movie were very intriguing, especially the Pickett's Charge scene.  The speech before hand was pretty cool as it highlights what makes people go to war.
However the best part of the movie was the portrayal by Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain.  He played the citizen-soldier to a T.  Watching him, I could somehow imagine the person who was thrust into a role that he wasn't really comfortable doing.  He did the reluctant warrior really well.  When he gave the orders to affix bayonets, chills went down my spine.

486348,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is the movie adaptation of Michael Sharra's book ""The Killer Angels,"" winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  The film is well acted, especially the roles played by Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Jeff Daniels.  As with most movies, ""Gettysburg"" cannot possibly capture the essence of the characters and the true emotion that the book so eloquently describes.  Director Ron Maxwell probably knew this going in, but chose to tackle the events, people, and emotions of the battle anyway.  He must be credited for the attempt, as it demonstrates a great courage in filmmaking.  What ""Gettysburg"" does is tries it's best to to communicate all of these events and emotions, and it comes through more often than not.  I've both read the book and watched the film several times, and I notice that Mr. Maxwell seems to capture more and more every time I watch it.  Particularly fascinating is Robert E. Lee's character (Sheen) and that of General Longstreet (Berenger) as they struggle to grapple with the historic implications of the decision to fight, and the consequences of the horrible losses they suffer.  The most stirring part of the film is the depiction of Col. Chamberlain's (Daniels) Maine troops defending Little Round Top on the second day of the battle.  Only the book, the movie, and actually visiting Little Round Top have put into perspective the savage fighting that took place there.

This movie quite correctly chronicles in a dramatic way, the Battle of Gettysburg. All in all, it covers the major events of the battle, but certainly does not cover everything, but that's ok. It is simply the best movie/docudrama ever made about the Battle of Gettysburg that has hit the big screen. I didn't say it was the best overall and accurate portrayal of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a great general view of it.
A lot of criticism has been aimed at this movie by Civil War buffs, mainly because of factual errors of who was on what part of the battlefield, whether or not the men cheered Lee right before Pickett's Charge, etc. I think those errors are there mainly because this movie is based on a work of fictional drama, the book ""The Killer Angels"", by Michael Shaara.
I loved Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, absolutely adored Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Sam Elliot as General Buford, and thought Kevin Conway's portrayal of the fictional ""Kilrain"", was stupendous! Richard Jordan's final performance as General Armisted, is compassionate and fantastic. I didn't like Martin Sheen cast as General Lee, I think he did as good a job as he could have, but wouldn't have cast his as Lee in a million years! I have recently read that Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones had been considered for that role, and would have loved to see either as Lee, than Sheen.
One other note, there is a ""long version"" of ""Gettysburg"", that has something like an additional 20-25 minutes of footage that was edited from it. I think that this version is even better, especially for those who aren't as well informed as to the specifics of the battle, as these 20-25 minutes fill in what is not said in the official release.
But, all in all, check out this film, as it is decidedly an excellent effort by the director, Ronald Maxwell. The musical score by Randy Edelman, is stupendous!!!!!
Also, look for cameos by Ken Burns, Ted Turner, and Brian Pohanka.",1043712000,10,2173,4.69109947643979
486362,5,6302548748,"The film Gettysburg, fully captures the experience of war as our generation has never been able to comprehend. For four years, men from both the north and the south fought for their respective causes; some to protect individual states rights, and others to maintain a perfect union. They knew nothing of laser guided bombs or missles fired on victims whos faces are invisible to us. They did know musket guns, small round lead balls used as bullets, a gun powder pouch, and a block of chewing tobacco to pass the time. They wore heavy uniforms, and marched hundreds of miles in 95 degree heat. When you watch this film, you will know how these brave men lived, and died in battle. You will know how it feels when a bullet pierces your shoulder when fired on from only 10-100 feet away; You will feel the cannons explode; You will smell the smoke of hundreds of rifles firing simultaniously, and you will know how it feels to see men on either side of you falling in battle. You will experience the emotinal and physical struggle just to make it through one more hour of life.
More importantly, you will learn from dialogue between officers and soldiers what they were thinking, and why they did what they did. Some call this a waste, but they are only looking for action, and ignoring the how and why of a soldiers commitment in fighting these battles. These men did not fight for money or power; they fought for a cause, and did so with great pride and dignity. Listen to the open hearts of brother fighting against brother; Of comrads in battles before the civil war now on opposite sides under opposing flags. Learn what went through the commanders mind when planning a battle with only the wisdom of scouts hiding in the fields to assist him. To those who don't like the dialogue, watch the film on your VCR, because most of it is edited out, along with many detailed scenes of the battles.
To fully appreciate the authenticity of this film, you have to walk a little farther than to the remote control of your television set; You have to go to the battlefield, and walk in those fields where so many lost their lives. Walk in solitude, and listen for the ghosts of the past to speak to you. Listen for the fife and drum play as they marched, and readied for battle. Walk in the wheatfield, and look down to see if any of the blood is still there. Go to the road behind the wheatfield, and listen for the union soldiers as they ready themselves to run across the field, only to get slaughtered by the confederates on the other side. They say that so many died there, you could not walk across it without slipping on the blood. Go to big round top, and see why both armies wanted it so dearly. There is where you will see and feel what the battle of gettysburg was all about.
Then go to the national cemetery, and look down at all the people who died defending our union. There are no southerners buried there. They were carried back to their homes. Read Lincolns gettysburg address, and fully comprehend what was in his heart. He truly wanted the war to end then and there, having no stomach for another year of war.

While Sheen is hard to stomach as the southern demi-god Robert E. Lee, Daniels and Beringer turn in career performances as opposing commanders asked to do the impossible while the fates of their armies-and countries-hang in the balance. Unfortunately for each side, the line-against-line battle tactics (dating to the hoplite phalanxes of ancient Greece) lagged decades behind the period's lethal weaponry. All the gallantry in the world doesn't go much good when a minie ball is twirling toward your chest. Throughout the conflict, the generals ask each other, ""Is this good ground?""

486367,5,6302548748,"This is a fine adaptation of Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"" which was a long-time best selling novel about the Battle of Gettysburg.  It is wonderfully done.
This film beautifully chronicles the clash between two of the greatest armies of all time at the pivotal battle of what was the greatest war in history up to that time.  Both sides are portrayed sympathetically, honorably, and honestly.  There is no ""Politically Correct"" Confederate-bashing here, although the film does not ignore the contradictions in the Confederate cause.  General Longstreet muses that ""I can never really think of those boys in blue as the enemy ... we broke the oath...""
Some of the acting in this film is first-rate, some is not.  Tom Berenger is wonderful as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen is splendid as Robert E. Lee.  Jeff Daniels does a fine job as Col. Joshua Chamberlain.  Richard Jordan, as General Armistead, is absolutely unforgettable, both as the bold, inspiring general and the wistful, sorrowful warrior reluctant to do battle against his former friends.
Occasionally the film indulges in a bit of lengthy speechifying by the various characters about the war and related issues, but in this film that is OK, and I thought that this added to, rather than detracted from, the film experience.
This is a film that respects the viewer and does not try to push any particular political agenda--which is a surprise since Ted Turner was the moving force behind the production.  The battle scenes are extremely well-done and the accompanying musical score is a definite plus that adds to the pace of the film.
This is a film that you'll want to watch repeatedly over the years.  It faithfully follows Shaara's fine novel, rarely departing from it, and tells a great story in a respectful and sometimes inspiring manner.",1038441600,2,1816,5.0066445182724255

The locations were the actual battlefield, the cast included heavyweights like Martin Sheen, who did wonderful, and Jeff Daniels, who did wonderful as well (surprisingly).  The script was very good and helped keep the film moving most of the time.  The acting was very good.  The cinematography is lush and gorgeous-very well done.  The strengths of this film far outweigh the weaknesses.  As important a war film as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, FULL METAL JACKET, or PLATOON.

The acting is superb. There is just one error that bothers me, that is with the battle of Little Round Top. The film shows the men fighting in a thick forest. The real battle ground would have been cleared and the ground would have been been covered with rocks. That mountain slop was cleared a few years befor the actual battle. The film makers made a huge error by filming that battle in a forrest. But every other aspect of the movie was done perfectly. This is a movie you can not miss if you are a Civil War buff.",1036281600,2,690,4.234848484848484
486410,5,6302548748,"Start with one of the most riveting moments in American history. Use as a guide one of the greatest treatments of that story- namely Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning ""The Killer Angels""- and so much so that the script very nearly word for word was taken from the book. Add the fantastic acting abilities of such men as Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Sam Elliot. Throw in for good measure several thousand Living Historians, also known as Re-enactors, who live and breathe the War Between the States. Film it all on the actual battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
  Given all of the above, this movie HAD to be a classic, in the company of such movies as All Quiet On The Western Front, Tora Tora Tora, or Zulu. It is intensely gripping- even though you know that Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia will be defeated and turned back, even though you know that Pickett's Charge will be smashed and repulsed, you are unable to tear yourself away from this film for even a moment.
  Historical accuracy was the watchword when making this film. Uniforms, weapons, hairstyles and beards, manners of speech- everything was made to be as authentic as possible. The result is a film that will not only show you the Battle of Gettysburg, it will take you there.
  The performances of the cast are superb. Martin Sheen as the religious, resigned, and gentle Robert E. Lee; Tom Berenger as the serious Longstreet, Lee's right hand man who senses doom but can not prevent it; Sam Elliot as General Buford, who fights his dismounted cavalry troops as infantry to slow the advancing Confederates and give the Federal Army time to arrive; and Jeff Daniels, who is unforgettable as Colonel Chamberlain, whose desperate defense of Little Round Top against overwhelming odds and relentless Rebel attacks saved the Federal Army's left flank and the Battle.
  The cinematography is outstanding, and the re-enactments of the different phases of the Battle are well directed and carried out. There is absolutely not one flaw in any facet of this film, unless you happen to be from below the Mason-Dixon Line and don't enjoy the outcome of the Battle!

486412,4,6302548748,"A ""must have"" for any military or war movie collection. The script is based on Shara's ""Killer Angels"" and one should read that book as well as see this movie. The plot focuses on the battle, with no gratuitous romance or other extraneous scenes.
The cast is great. At times found it hard to accept Berrenger as Longstreet (I keep seeing him as the psychotic sergeant from Platoon) and as Jeff ""Dumb and Dumber"" Chamberlain.  However, both actors do a great job in the film. I enjoyed Sheen's protrayal as a serene Lee. Shara's book paints a much less positive image of Lee focusing on his ill health. Sam Elliot is the one character I felt was misplaced. Although a natural on a horse, he severely overacted. Also I felt he was too ""Hollywood"" handsome to fit my vision of Buford, a general that died from disease not long after the battle.
The scenes relating to the defense of Little Round Top rank at the top of any war movie footage. The historical accuracy is first rate. The camera angles and editing are perfect. Except for the blood and smell of fear, you are there.
Not just civil war grognards can enjoy this film. I recently rewatched this with my wife, who is not overly interested in the war. She enjoyed the film and was inspired to take a tour of the battlefield.",1030492800,2,1279,4.489270386266094
486413,5,6302548748,"This movie proves once and for all that you don't need a lot of blood and gore to show that ""War is Hell.""  That fact is very apparent by the way the story unfolds, and by the way the characters interact, especially those on opposing sides.  You don't need excessive violence to show the pain and heartache that is associated with war.
Rather than focus on the physical horrors of war, this movie endeavors to show the emotional terror, and does the job remarkably well.  This is accomplished mainly by the development of characters on both sides.  Upon watching this movie, it is impossible to decide who are the 'good guys' and who are the 'bad guys.'
This is the main reason why this movie is so great--it accurately portrays the underlying aspect of the Civil War; there were no 'good guys', and nobody 'won'.  This movie shows this tragic fact--that even the so-called 'victors' (the North) lost a great deal from the war.
As mentioned, the use of characters in this movie is moving.  There are officers who'd served together in previous conflicts, men who respected one another greatly, even two best friends.  I don't think it was possible for anyone to hate the enemy, or even to rightly call him 'enemy.'  They were simply fighting for a cause.
As has been abundantly mentioned in these reviews, this movie is over four hours long, but it does not become tedious.  Every scene in this movie contributes to it's power, to it's message.  It is worth watching over and over again.
I won't say that this movie is totally accurate (I doubt any movie is), but I will say that this is a fair portrayal of what happened.  What this movie lacks in incidental details, it makes up in emotional power.
For an accurate narrative of the Civil War, and for a good look into how the men who fought this most tragic of wars and this most devastating of battles must have felt, there is no better film than Gettysburg.",1030406400,5,1910,4.571847507331379

Afterwards, I showed him the section where the Confederates form up for Pickett's Charge. He is a Korean War vet who wept unabashedly as the Charge went in. This is my all time favorite movie to the extent that I wore out the VHS tape with repeated viewings. It is a painstakingly yet loving and respectful rendering of the pivotal battle of the Civil War. It is well cast and well acted. Martin Sheen is not a favorite of mine, but he captures Robert E. Lee as well as anyone could. The film shows in moving detail how deeply the troops cared for Lee, as they did in reality. Tom Beringer, who is a favorite, is excellent as General Longstreet. The facial hair on most characters is obviously fake, but not to the point of being distracting. At four hours, it's a long, long film, but it simply never drags; it is in the details that the story line and the reality of the setting are maintained There are no computer enhanced graphics; the cast includes several thousand Civil War reinactors, which produces combat scenes of gut-wrenching realism. Some of them are interviewed in an ""extra feature"", and their reverence for the battle site is moving. ""Gettysburg"" permits the viewer to understand, through the onscreen exchanges between characters, what the Civil War was all about. But most of all, it demonstrates the unflagging courage which American soldiers have displayed since the birth of our Country, and it is probably that aspect of the film that I find most moving. The DVD needs a big screen to do justice to the panoramic scope of the battle scenes, but the disc is a marked improvement over the tape. If I have one reservation, it has to do with the sound. Dolby 5.0 is good, but to have the subwoofer kick in during the artillery firing sequences would have been better.

The movie isn't word for word with the book but that's ok. It's also not word for word with history with 1 or 2 mistakes. Basic plot is from July 1st to July 3rd, 1863, the largest battle in the Western Hemisphere takes place in a small Pennsylvania town practically turning the tide of the Civil War.

However, that is also the problem with the movie. Shaara in his book gets much of the history quite wrong, particularly in his portrayal of Lee. Because the movie faithfully follows his book, this inaccurate portrayal of Lee as an old, tired man ends up in the movie. Also, there are many other errors, such as the Stonewall Brigade appearing in Pickett's Charge as well as the scene where the orders go out for it, are completely wrong.

It is simply a movie based off of the book Killer Angels by Shaara.  The host of famous actors in this movie and the filming is spectactular.  Yes, this movie doesn't cover it all, but it is based from a fictional book that doesn't cover it all.

486429,5,6302548748,"Okay, okay, ""Gettysburg"" is released the same year that some blockbuster ""Apollo 11"" comes out and pretty much ousts the competition, but to leave this three plus hour epic totally left for naught at the Oscars is an extreme insult to everyone that took part in Ronald F. Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"".
Based from Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""The Killer Angels"", ""Gettysburg"" brags an all-star (and heavily underrated) cast of Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Richard Jordan, Stephen Lang, and Sam Elliott. The film was written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and scored by Randy Edelman. The film was actually more successful when it was put on television as a mini-series, but this incredible movie will be branded in my heart forever.
The story follows the main characters of Confederate generals Lee (Sheen), Longstreet (Berenger), and Union colonel Chamberlain (Daniels) as both their armies meet accidentally in a small town called Gettysburg in the heat of July, 1863. With effective supporting roles, Sam Elliott opens the story for us as cavalry general Buford, a hardened veteran who was the real hero of the first day, snubbed (ahem) from credit because the Union commander at the time did not favor cavalry. Stephen Lang plays Confederate general Pickett, one of the most famous (or infamous) generals ever to be known in American history. But, by far, the best role is that of fellow Confederate general Lewis Armistead, played (in his final role) by Richard Jordan. Armistead is a conflicted man as he must face his best friend on the opposite side of the battlefield.
""Gettysburg"" wisely focuses more on the lives surrounding the battle than the battle itself, creating a heavy atmosphere. When there are battle scenes, they're more dramatized than anything else - focus again was supposed to be on the characters, not on the gore, so sometimes it seems a little fake. For we historical nitpickers, Sheen's Virginian accent is too heavy, and Longstreet's beard is horrible, but if you're looking for what could have easily been the best picture of 1993, buy this.
I believe their should have been four nominations: Best Actor (Daniels) who as Chamberlain, unquestionably gives the best performance of his career; Best Supporting Actor (Jordan), who would die of brain cancer before the film could premiere easily was given the most emotional role, and delivers incredibly. His monologues are performed beautifully, which leads to the next ""snubbed"", which is Adaptation Screenplay, for Maxwell.

If not staring off into the horizon, then the figure should be addressing a subordinate.  Now apply this formula for 4 hours.  Intersperse this with battle scenes that are shown several times but are passed off as unique scenes.

486431,5,6302548748,"Don't let the length intimidate you.  Don't be deterred by the fact that Ted Turner produced this for television.  Yes, it was supposed to be a miniseries, but Turner and director Ronal F. Maxwell were so proud of their work and so confident of the accuracy of the retelling of Shaara's novel ""The Killer Angels"" and the actual Battle of Gettysburg that they released it in theatres instead.  And this is one of those rare movies that was destined and deserved nothing less than the silver screen.  A few names jump out at you right away: Martin Sheen in his most inspired and meaningful performance, just breathing life and artistry into the character of Robert E. Lee.  Tom Berenger was never more perfectly cast than as the Alabamian James Longstreet.  Honestly, perfect.  Jeff Daniels was exciting and energetic as Joshua Chamberlain, a relative of mine, no kidding, and he is truly awe inspiring, the way he comes from no military background and leads his men in superb order, just as good as any of the career soldiers.  And finally, special guest appearance by Sam Elliot.  Special guest appearance???  Elliot's guest appearance as the underlauded and underappreciated John Buford was forceful and personal.  Not only did Buford hold the ground for the approaching Union Army, but Elliot held down the film until Sheen, Berenger and Daniels took over the movie.  The cinematography is beautiful, the locations are truly majestic.  The score is wonderful, fusing the guitars in with a symphonic orchestra.  The costumes and the way in which they were worn and preferred by different officers is very true to form.  The performances are wonderful, full of intellegient reenactors who know what they're doing.  Please, don't let the lenght intimidate you.  You're not just learning about the battle here.  The more important thing here is the commaradery felt between men on both sides and the men on the different sides, highlighted by the touching depcitions of pre-war friendship of Lo Armistead and Winfield Scott Hancock.  Some fought for rights, others fought for mere pride, others fought because it seemed lke the right thing to do.

I saw it first in the theater eight years ago and watch parts of the film over and over. Scenes and people are realistic. People fighting for their ""rats"" (a Northerners misunderstanding of the Southern pronunciation of ""rights"") offers an interpretation of the causes of the war.
For me, there are valuable illustrations of life today available in scenes from 'Gettysburg'.
When Lee disciplines Stuart for his absence, we see a perfectly executed reprimand. Leaders in business today can learn from Lee's excellent, effective use of punishment.
When Lee takes three minutes to tell Longstreet his vision for what we now refer to as ""Pickett's Charge"", we learn how a clear, simple vision can also be the recipe for disaster, even if Pickett and his charges came within minutes or feet of carrying the day.
Chamberlain's speech to the mutinous troops at the onset of the film offers lessons on the power of persuasive speaking. And, immediately preceding the speech, we see how Chamberlain leads by example, as he starts his morning.
Living just down the road a piece from Pennsylvania and the national battlefield, I can appreciate just how close Lee came to winning the battle, the day, and, perhaps, the war. This a a great lesson in history with scenes worth waching and appreciating today.",1025740800,13,1401,4.965957446808511

486436,5,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is a monumental effort to depict the Civil War events of July 3-5,1863 in Pennsylvania and succeeds magnificently on all levels. Both from an historical and theatical perspective, this movie is a ""must-see"". On the historical side, this movie manages to portray the personalities with both historical accuracy and believability...one cannot help but like and admire the principals on both sides. Tom Berenger is magnificent as ""Ol' Pete"" Longstreet as is Jeff Daniels playing Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain...I had a little harder time accepting Martin Sheen as R.E. Lee. Although wonderfully acted, Sheen just did not fit my impressions of Lee (I probably have seen him too much on ""West Wing""). The battle scenes, to me, were the best I've seen in movie form...both the 20th Maine's stand on Little Roundtop and Pickett's charge were amazingly portrayed and highly accurate...I could not find any historical in-acurracies in any of these scenes (I don't consider myself an expert in Civil War military tactics, however). From a theatrical perspective, this had all the high quality cinematography and direction that makes for epic films...both the battle scenes and the one-on-one personal encounters were wonderfully depicted. For anyone interested at all in the Civil War or anyone wanting to watch a classic movie, this is one to see. I highly recommend it!",1023235200,7,1372,5.298165137614679
486437,5,6302548748,"As a Brit, it may seam unusual to have an interest in Civil War history, but having read Killer Angels, I just had to get the DVD. Fortunately I have a multi region player, and was not dissapointed. The film sticks faithfully to the book's focus on charactres rather than the bloodshed & violence, and thus is extremely moving. Richard Jordan's pain during his final meeting with Longstreet is almost unbearable, and worth the purchase price for that alone. I would recommend this film to anybody, and would tell them not to be put off by the length...you do not notice it as you are utterly engrosed. One of THE best films.",1020556800,2,624,4.580357142857143
486438,4,6302548748,"(I am editing this review to correct some mistakes and add more insights)
1993. What do you think of? The Fugitive? The Three Musketeers? Jurassic Park?
Or how about a film that was so unsuccessful in the box-office that it was never even released in my country, Australia?
I discovered this film while reading a book on war films. I hired the video - and the film became a part of my childhood.

The story is based on the Pulitzer prize winning novel ""The Killer Angels,"" by Michael Shaara. The plot is a dramatisation of the greatest battle in American history: the Battle of Gettysburg.
In three days, more men were killed than in the entire Vietnam War. And while hippies and sit-ins were awaiting a more psychedelic generation, history was made in the fields of Pennsylvania. The battle is so suited to drama - sheer, epic, powerful drama - that I initially took the film to be mainly fictional. But no! Barely a shred of fiction will you find in this film. It is highly authentic - yet so dramatic.

The theme of this film is the clash of two equally understandable ideologies. This makes the film highly dramatic at a level above what one would normally expect from a war film.
We feel for both sides. We in fact feel torn, just as the Americans were torn. Which ideology to sympathise with? Which one to curse? We flip flop from North to South to North again. States rights or emancipation? Romantic South or machine-age North? Aristocracy or equality?
I am an Australian, by the way. Perhaps only an outsider can see this film with perfect clarity. An Australian is no fonder of the North than the South. And so the conflict between the two ideologies reenacts the conflict of the original event.
The battle-scenes not perfect - well below the quality of Glory, for example - but the huge number (3500) of reenactors help, because they look absolutely authentic. If sometimes a little overweight...
The DVD: This disc is not perfect either. In the original version of this review I thought the disc was non-anamorphic. I was wrong, it is enhanced anamorphic. So in fact, I am downgrading my opinion of this transfer. It is not perfect; a little dull and soft. The detail is not razor-clear, and sometimes the colours bleed, especially Colonel Fremantle's red coat, which looks literally fluorescent. Ouch!
However, overall, it is a watchable image, stable and clean.
The extras on this DVD are formidable. My favourite is the commentary which is given by various people, including famous historian James McPherson. There is a documentary on the making of the film, which includes nice interviews with Shelby Foote, the grey-bearded Southerner in Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" - and in fact, even features Ken Burns himself!
 There are also battlefield maps, taken from a book, with a full and fascinating commentary over the top.
Overall, this is a DVD definitely worth buying for fans of history. The film itself is marvellous; and the DVD is very good, though not perfect.",1018224000,4,2976,4.774757281553398
486467,5,6302548748,"We all ""know"" what happened here, but in reality we have no idea.  This is by far the best movie about the Civil War you may ever see.  Tremendously well plotted, portrayed brilliantly in the real life scenarios their characters faced, and acted out superbly, this is one great movie.  The four hours you spend watching it goes by instanteously, and at the end you will be asking for more.  If you ever get to see the director's cut, shown now and then on TNT and TBS, you will like the movie even more (yes they cut out good stuff for the theatre/DVD/VHS release).  The story is amazing, it is a must have for your collection for any movie fan.",1017619200,4,645,4.341666666666667
486468,5,6302548748,Gettysburg provides Americans a view of what Civil War troops faced in battle. I show this film to every class I teach. Students love it. It helps show the debt that has been paid for our freedom today.,1017014400,2,202,4.342105263157895
486469,5,6302548748,"If for no other reason than his production of GETTYSBURG, Ted Turner deserves to be remembered with thanks by generations of filmgoers to come -- long after everyone has forgotten the flap over colorization.
When you think about it, the idea was a natural. Bring together some talented Hollywood actors, a very competent director, and join them with thousands of Civil War re-enactors -- those hardy hobbyists who live to commemorate the War Between the States. No other war film can boast thousands of authentically dressed extras for the many battle scenes. The result is an epic sweep which really gives one an idea what a tragedy the death of 55,000 brave Americans looked and felt like.
Because Civil War re-enactors tend to be over 40 and a bit generous of girth, the soldiers may not have looked quite like the gaunt figures captured by the cameras of Matthew Brady. No matter: They more than made up for it in enthusiasm.
For the sake of simplicity, we see three parts of the battle. First Union Cavalry General Buford (ably played by Sam Elliott) takes possession of the town of Gettysburg and its adjacent high ground and keeps the battle hot until the infantry arrives. On the second day is the brilliant defense of Little Round Top by Col Chamberlain (played by Jeff Daniels) and his 20th Maine Regiment at the far left of the 20-mile-long Union Line. The climax comes with Pickett's Charge on the third day against the center of the Union Line.
We see the action primarily from the point of view of the South. While the commander of the Union forces, General Meade (Richard Anderson), appears in only one short scene, there are numerous meetings between General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) and Robert E Lee (a superb performance by Martin Sheen). We get to meet and know Pickett (Stephen Lang), Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan), and several other members of the Confederate General Staff. On the Northern side, there are all too few scenes with Winfield Scott Hancock, the general who takes the full brunt of Pickett's charge.
Since I saw the premiere of this film on TNT in 1993, I have come back to it again and again; and I am particularly happy to have obtained the DVD recently. If you like the Civil War, if you like history, if you like war films, if you like GREAT films, you too will come back for more.",1015113600,5,2329,4.69682151589242
486470,5,6302548748,"An outstanding movie - gripping, subtle, and engaging.  Yes, parts of it seem somewhat romanticized for film (Chamberlain's speeches, various wistful glances) but even those are probably not too far from possible truth.  One thing which continually stirrs up controversy, apparently, is Sheen's depiction of Lee.  I thought it was sensitive, compelling, and possibly quite accurate.  Senile?  I don't think so.  Careless and/or irresponsible?  Nope.  It is true that his actions in that campaign stirred up his own commanders (who debated it years after the war and Lee's death).  I still get chills watching Sheen in this role.  Lee's evident sincerity, commitment, and absolute dedication are all apparent.  Someone commented that ""it's amazing his men didn't shoot him"", or something like that...  I think this is a remarkably myopic thing to write...  remember - this was just one campaign in a long war, and Lee had won many victories prior (and after).",1014854400,2,958,5.223684210526316
486471,5,6302548748,"What???  You're asking yourself, ""What?""  How could a film about the climatic battle of the American Civil War have any relevance on today's post-9/11 world?  Well, it's in the dialogue, not the ""action"".  Let me explain.  Go to Chapter 20 and listen to the dialogue between the Confederate General Kemper, (I think) and the British officer.  The dialogue talks about how that in a democracy, the government derives its power from the consent of the people.  However as the South's major gripe is that it doesn't consent with the laws of the Federal government, so that is what it bases its griefance to secede from the Union in favor of strong State governments.  Sound familiar?  That's what today we call ""Europe"".  Instead of a united union as the European Union is trying to accomplish, there's still international animosity over there.  Just think of the power the ""Union of European States"" could accomplish if they banded together.
But anyway, how does that tie into 9/11, well it doesn't directly, but in a round about way it does.  It ties in to that a united union as the United States is today, due to the victory of the North in the Civil War, is as strong as ever in time of crisis.  Hence the ol' quote, ""United We Stand, Divided We Fall.""
Now, enough about politics.  Let's talk about the film itself and the DVD.  First of all, the film itself is the definitive period piece of the battle of Gettysburg.  No other film to date has captured the essense of those three glorious and gory days in July 1863.  For one it uses actual Civil War re-enactors for all of the common foot soldiers.  Not only that but it was all filmed on location in Gettysburg National Park.  By using actual re-enactors, they already had their equipment and most importantly their heart into making this film.  Mostly because they filmed it on the hallowed ground that is Gettysburg.
Now for the DVD itself.  The picture transfer is excellent.  In 16x9 enhanced mode it is extremely sharp and detailed.  I find [the] rating of 3.5 a bit low.  I'd say it's more like a 4.5.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 is that the colors are a bit on the ""cool"" side.  Meaning that the ultra-violet comes through a bit more than it should. (My TV has a color temp control and a setting to Warm makes them look a little more natural.)
The sound is actually quite good as well.  Much clearer than my old VHS copy.  It's recorded in a 5.0 Surround, so no .1 LFE.  But the bass still comes through quite nicely on the cannon shots and in Randy Edelman's score.
Now for the extras, are not bad, but not all that great either.  You get a vintage documentary that covers the actual battlefield and whatnot.  Then you get a few short clips of cast and crew interviews.  A few trailers and TV spots.  Actually a relatively short narrated overview of some archived maps of the battle is quite informative.  But apparently the running comentary is supposed to be really informative, but I have't got the time to watch a 4 hour movie with the commentary on.
Well so if you want a long lasting version of this 1993 Turner Entertainment film of Gettysburg, be sure to grab this DVD.  ...",1014249600,3,3154,4.522123893805309
486472,5,6302548748,"This movies is my all-time favorite for the war genre.  It was well worth the $20 million price tag for Turner Pictures.  Gettysburg is the classic war saga minus the romance along the lines of Gone With The Wind.  The performances of all the actors are splendid.  My personal favorites are the performances given by Tom Berenger as Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, Richard Jordan as Gen. Lewis Armistead, Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as Brig. Gen. John Buford, and of course Stephen Lang as Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett.  The performance by Jordan was to be his last as he became ill with a brain tumor and died 9 months after the filming of Gettysburg.  He is caught between love and war with his long-time friend Maj. Gen Winfield Hancock (Brian Mallon) on the opposing Union side.  Armistead suffers considerable agony which is obvious to even the casual viewer especially when the director Ronald F. Maxwell spends considerable time on Armistead trying to bait Lt Gen Longstreet (Tom Berenger) into relieving Armistead of the upcoming battle.  Jeff Daniels was a very big suprise for me.  I picture Daniels in the toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber and would not have cast him myself in this epic, but that just shows the genius behind casting director Joy Todd.  Sam Elliot's role as Buford can be summed up in the following quote  ""Meade will come in slowly, cautiously, new to command... And then, after Lee's army is entrenched behind nice fat rocks, Meade will attack finally, if he can coordinate the army. He'll attack right up that rocky slope, and up that gorgeous field of fire. And we will charge valiantly, and be butchered valiantly. And afterwards men in tall hats and gold watch fobs will thump their chest and say what a brave charge it was. Devin, I've led a soldier's life, and I've never seen anything as brutally clear as this""...wonderful!  Alot of love was given to the filming of this movie.  5,000 non-paid re-enactors were hired to play the roles of the thousands of anonymous faces.  Even Ted Turner himself picked up the musket and was among the ones counted during Pickett's charge.  He can be seen, but only for a nano-second.  I can write forever on this films' qualities but to finish it up, the accuracy in this film is phenomenal.  The greatest example of this is how Ronald F.Maxwell uses actual quotes recorded by soldiers from that famous battle.  Gen. Pickett: ""Up men, up! And let no man forget today that you are from old Virginia!""  Gen. Armistead: ""Virginians! Virginians! For your land - for your homes - for your sweethearts - for your wives - for Virginia! Forward... march!""",1013990400,57,2640,4.75
486473,5,6302548748,Anyone remotely interested in history especially the civil war should see this movie.  It is historically accurate for the most part and is very well made even though it was originally filmed as a made for tv film to be shown on TNT.  I do like that it was shot at the actual battlefield and used reenactors as extras.  If you like history and own a DVD player but do not have this film but it now you will not regret it.,1013817600,,421,4.109756097560975
486474,5,6302548748,"Three miles from my house here in Bedford, PA are ancient scars in the side of a mountain.  They were entrenchments dug during the Gettysburg Campaign -- in case General Lee's forces headed north to cut off railroad lines at Altoona.  Those trenches were dug by locals but never used.  They are still clearly discernible.
 My great grandfather was Bedford County, PA's last living Civil War veteran (he died in 1942 at age 96).  He was in a PA Regiment that MISSED Gettysburg: his unit was at Vicksburg which fell the same day the battle in PA ended.
 I have viewed this movie many times.  Its careful attention to tactical details seems perfect.  The actors are well-cast despite somewhat ersatz-looking beards and moustaches.  However, considering July in PA and wool uniforms the real soldiers wore, I doubt they were much ""handsomer"" than our actors.
 A comment on General Lee.  Some have objected to Martin Sheen's portrayal.  Lee, at the time, was suffering from an increasingly harsh heart condition that, in time, would take him.  I believe that was factored into the movie, although subtly.  Sheen shows his understanding of this generally little-known fact.
 Chamberlain and Longstreet were excellently played, as was CSA General Armitage.  In fact, considering the complex nature of this work (not a 'film' but a 'work') Mr. Maxwell rates high praise.
 I visit the National Military Park at Gettysburg when my spirits flag.  Every time I reclaim my honor and love for being a U.S. citizen.  No matter which side, the men for whom Gettysburg is portrayed, all were heroes.
 The real difference? Today we are callused of spirit.  The men of Gettysburg's time had a refreshing naievete' and sentimentality.  We might be better people if we laughed and cried easier -- and for real reasons and not artifice.

My group (8th KS, it's in the credits...look!) is in it, as well as many other reenacting groups; they protray accurately what the men did 139 years ago.  This movie also takes an inside look at what generals and other military leaders were discussing behind the lines.  Even though there are some mistakes (mostly errors and not factual) it's still great.  The prequel to this movie (which is a book by  Michael Shaara, or his father) called ""Gods and Generals"" will be released later in 2002.  A couple of my friends (including one relative) are in this movie as extras.  I would say that if you liked ""Gettysburg"", read ""Gods and Generals"" and see the movie.  I don't which group of people to recommend this to, but history buffs and who ever likes war.  I'm expecting ""Gods and Generals"" to be as good as ""Gettysburg"", but if it isn't then...oh well!

To watch the personal struggles each general faces when ordering his men into battle and sure death is captured very well.  Berenger, in a wonderful performance as General Longstreet, truly captures Longstreet's agony when ordering his men to march across a one mile open stretch into blazing guns.  Daniels, as Chamberlain, gives a moving performance as he tries to rally his men to fight for the cause.  Probably Jeff Daniels best role to date.  Richard Jordan's performance as General Armistead, is the most moving of all as he discusses with Longstreet, his personal dilema with raising his hand against his best friend.  Truly a struggle between brothers, friend against friend. Well done!  A must see.  A must read, as well!!",1012348800,3,884,4.84
486508,3,6302548748,"As an extra in the movie and a high school history teacher, I guess I have a point of view different than most. From the beginning of the film (when a 400 pound Confederate sergeant who is suppose to have walked all the way from Virginia) stops someone from entering his picket line to the horrible looking ... beards of Longstreet and Jeb Stuart; there are too many inaccuracies to mention.
 It is true that the director (Ron Maxwell) had a limited budget; that he had to take re-enactors as extra's for the movie (which means the average age & weight were all wrong) but that doesn't excuse his use of different film for the Picket Charge scene. No one can miss that he filmed Pickett's Charge at different places and at different times of the day. The worst part of the film is the acting job of Martin Sheen as General Lee. If Lee had really behaved this way it would be a wonder that his own men didn't shoot him. It is beyond me why Maxwell allowed Lee to be portrayed as a horrible commander and as borderline senile to boot.
 At least the South is not portrayed as the evil slave beating stereotypes, although it is clear that the Yankees are the true hero's in this film....",1011830400,2,1183,4.372727272727273

The movie draws you into the intensity of the battle and leaves your heart pounding at the end of the film.  I especially enjoyed the portrayals of Richard Jordan as Lewis Armistead and Stephen Lange as General Pickett.  Although a lengthy film, its story commands your attention every moment.

Having said that, however, it must be remembered that the battle was fought as a series of blunders and mistakes by the various commanders.  This movie makes clear the important results of these errors, and it strongly points out the ""fog of battle"" that surrounds any military action; a condition any commander would recognize.  As history, this movie is much closer to reality than to fiction, and is highly recommended.",1009411200,2,596,5.123711340206185
486511,5,6302548748,"This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, ""The Killer Angels"", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film  examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).

The viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.

The rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers. This is a film entirely about the men who took part in the battle at Gettysburg and the outcome that set the course for the country we know today. Kudos to director Robert F.

Martin Sheen as Robt E. Lee is a gross disappoinment.  It's as though he were reading cue cards, his accent sometimes on the wrong syllables even -- does Sheen speak English as a second language?  He makes a better Bill Clinton.
Whoever plays J.E.B. Stuart fails miserably to capture anything of the man but his tardiness at the battle.
Too many ""we're fighting to free the slaves"" references to be stomached by any serious student of the war, or any Southerner in particular.  There are no blacks anywhere in the Army of Northern Virginia, despite the documented presence of literally thousands throughout the war.  The obligatory runaway slave in broken manacles and the rousing ""War-to-Set-Other-Men-Free"" speach by Joshua Chamberlain is completely over the top.  FF.
The accents are generally contrived -- the dialogue is poorly written.  It sounds more like 5th grade backyard drama than 18th century Americana.
Longstreet, is not bad, but for the accent, the wierdly wagging false beard, and incredibly HUGE hat.  Other than that, great job by Tom Berenger.
Finally, the blubbering representation of Armistead crying over his erstwhile friend Hancock is nauseating in the extreme -- it goes on so you would almost think the two were lovers.
Battle scenes were definitely the highlight.  Some weak long shots consisting of poorly painted mattes.

486528,4,6302548748,"This is the Battle of Gettysburg as presented by Turner Home Entertainment/Turner Pictures. You will recognize Ted Turner -- top banana in this bunch -- as the man known worldwide as Mr. Jane Fonda.
The battle scenes are as advertised in the blurbs on the box: ""...some of the most authentic Civil War battle scenes ever committed to film, accurately depicting events and battles...."" Yes, the battle scenes were impressive, convincing, and appeared to be the result of a good deal of effort by the director and the cast.
The actors, appropriately, speak through great, obvious wads of cotton batting pretending to be whiskers, as they deliver their lines. Apparently, this film provided work for many re-enactors and students of the Civil War.
Right from the get-go, however, Turner Home Entertainment stakes out the anti-Confederate low ground with this film. They depict the South's greatest hero -- and arguably the greatest general of all time -- as an almost dwarf-like creature astride a stunted horse. This is an elaborate metaphor, involving casting, direction, and the portrayal of General Lee, intended to diminish honor, glory, bravery, and to revise history. Both horse and rider appear as ""smaller-than-life"" characters.
In scene after scene, General Robert E. Lee, a man of erect bearing just over 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighing 170 pounds is shown among men who tower over him, both on foot and on horseback. If this were the case, the entire Confederate army would have to have been over 6 feet 4 inches tall. The only people obviously shorter than Robert E. Lee, in this film, are the 12-year-old drummer boys.
The ""Dukes of Hazard"" had a more convincing General Lee.
Martin Sheen, a small (in many ways) leftist actor, but not without talent, plays the heroic Southern General as a stubby neurotic in various states of confusion bordering on hysteria. The viewer is led to picture Robert E. Lee as a Leprechaun instead of the giant that he was.
Mr. Sheen's Southern drawl was well done, almost musical, but one wonders if Professor Henry Higgins would find it appropriate for a man raised in Northern Virginia?
Not content with this miscarriage of history Ted Turner and his hench-persons perform the same alchemist's transformation on Traveller: General Lee's trusty battle charger. The war-horse is depicted not only as too small, but also as the proverbial ""horse of a different color"".
The real Traveller was in Lee's own words: ""Confederate gray with black mane and tail,"" while the animal under Martin Sheen in the film appears white, with gray mane and tail (sometimes it appears as all white).
The real Traveller was fully 16 hands high and over 1,300 pounds, apparently too much horse for the diminutive Sheen. So, a great battle charger was transformed into a stunted pony-like animal.
Quite an effective metaphor really: depicting Robert E. Lee as a stubby historical figure. It is only a short hop to the conclusion that, because he was small in stature, he had small ideas, small talents and little courage. None of this is true.
Despite the shortcomings discussed above, this film is worth watching for the battle scenes and for the attention paid to the details of the battle of Gettysburg.",999993600,3,3225,4.974074074074074

When attempting to make a movie like this the temptation to descend into commercialism must be strong indeed. This is entirely absent here. History is left to speak for itself, and rightly so. I wish the producers of the unspeakably bad ""U-571"" and ""The Patriot"" had taken a leaf from the same book. Sheen is brilliant as Lee. For me his best scene is when Lee reviews Pickett's division. With only facial expressions he totally captures Lee's character. Berenger,Jordan & Daniels are teriffic as well. My only regret is that I did not see this film on the big screen. To the best of my knowledge it was only shown in two cinemas in London because of its length. A great shame. How about a movie about Patrick Cleburne?

All the members of the cast and production team gave there all into making this memorable film. The DVD is just as memorable. It features a wealth of information on the battle, the making of the film, and theatrical trailers and cast and crew interviews. But I believe the highlight of the DVD to be the commentary track by Writer/Director Ronald F. Maxwell, Military Historian Craig Symonds, Author and Historian James M. McPherson, and Director of Photography Kees Van Oostrum. It offers a wealth of info on the production of the film and the battle at it's backdrop.

486532,5,6302548748,"Movie:
It's easy to make a bad Civil War film. It's easy to focus on the racism of the South, or the greed of the North. It's easy to focus on either the bloody desperation of the battles or the heroism of the soldiers, and fail to show how they're linked. It's easy to make a film with a huge cast where most of the actors just show up for work and don't make much of an effort. It's all so very easy.
_Gettysburg_ is a great movie because it avoids all those easy traps. The movie faithfully captures the motivations of the Confederate soldiers -- not as defenders of slavery but rather as defenders of a way of life. So, too, are captured the motivations of Federals -- fighting for ideals, whether of Union, justice, or freedom for all men. Laudably, the movie also subtly captures some of the condescension that even Northerners felt for the slaves. Notice that in the scene with the ""John Henry"" the unnamed black man is talked around, as if he were a child or an idiot; he's never addressed directly.
The bloody, desperate work of war is captured very well in the battle scenes, particularly in the scenes on Little Round Top. In that scene, too, the heroism of the Union soldiers in the face of almost certain death is on display. Confederates have their moments of heroism and desperation on the next day, when Armistead's brigade reaches the top, charging into near-certain death. In both instances the slaughter and heroism are presented accurately, as dual faces of a single coin, and they are balanced admirably.
Still, the performances of the actors in this film are what makes it great. Lancaster is uneven as Freemantle, but that's the only notable acting complaint. That one low spot is overshadowed by so many fine appearances, it's hard to give them all their proper due. Jeff Daniels puts in his finest performance ever, and Tom Berenger utterly disappears into the part of Longstreet. Martin Sheen's Lee is a little more befuddled than strictly necessary, but otherwise wonderful. Sam Elliott is perfectly cast as Buford, and Stephen Lang is excellent as Pickett. Wm. Sheppard also puts in a wonderful turn as General Trimble.
The real show-stopper, however, is Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead. His performance provides the emotional core of the film, dealing most intimately with the Civil War's central irony: these savage battles were fought between friends. His last words in the film sound like a eulogy to every man who fell in the war. Anyone not moved by his final scene has a heart of stone.
In short, this is easily the best Civil War film ever made, and arguably the best movie ever made about any war. _Gettysburg_ perfectly blends history with moviemaking, and the result is a work of art no lover of either discipline should be without.
DVD Version:
This DVD has so much bang for your buck you'd be an idiot not to buy it. In addition to the film, which as I've pointed out is excellent, it carries two well-made documentaries that cover both the history and the film-making quite effectively, a good collection of maps (with commentary), and an excellent commentary track for the film (although unfortunately it does not cover all scenes). This is one of the most relevant set of DVD bonuses I've ever seen. It's almost worth buying the player just to watch this one disk.",998265600,5,3307,4.703448275862069

486534,4,6302548748,"Movies based on history fall into one of two categories.  They're either wonderful stories that are flawed on facts (Braveheart, JFK, for example), or they're faithful to the facts but lack drama (The Battle of Britain, produced by Harry Saltzman in the late '60s).  This film, written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, manages to be fairly accurate storytelling and compelling drama at the same time.  That Maxwell's movie embodies these two qualities in an almost four-hour picture is no small feat either.
The movie recreates the pivotal battle of the Civil War, when General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia sought to  destroy the Union forces under General George Meade at Gettysburg, a small town in Pennsylvania.  Maxwell's towering achievement in this movie, besides the many well-staged battle scenes, is to highlight the personal, emotional anguish of the soldiers on both sides, some of whom had been quite close before the war began. Witness the scene in the tent of General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) as General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, in one of his last screen roles) speaks emotionally about his friend, General Hancock, who he knows is just over the ridge where they will attack the next day.  Tears well up in Jordan's eyes as he recalls the deep affection that he developed for Hancock and his wife many years before.
Gettysburg is not a great movie, but it is a very good one, and well worth viewing for any American who is interested in the war that tore this nation asunder and, in some ways, made it more unified afterwards.",997315200,9,1576,4.883895131086143

The excellent portrayal of the men that fought this deciding battle of the Civil War is amazing.  Jeff Daniels is the perfect choice for Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.  He is a wonderful mix of sensativity and total strength.  Tom Berenger is wonderful as Longstreet, showing the moral, ethical and tactical problems he had with the fight at Gettysburg and the fight within himself between military loyalty or morality.  It is almost impossible not to get emotionally involved in this movie and feel the pain of each leader and soldier on both sides.  Other Civil War movies portary one side( mostly the north) as the ultimate good guy.  Gettysburg shows that neither side was good or bad but just fighting for what they believed in and doesn't ask that the viewer chooses a side but instead asks that we feel for everybody on the field.  And it isn't hard to do.

486562,5,6302548748,"When Gettysburg first appeared on movie screens in 1993, audiences agreed that it was truly one of the great American war films.  Based on the late Michael Shaara's best selling book THE KILLER ANGELS, GETTYSBURG assembled a superb cast including Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, Sam Elliott, C. Thomas Howell, the late Richard Jordan and 5,000 Civil War reenactors.  Filmed on location within the boundaries of the National Battlefield Park and surrounding Adams County, GETTYSBURG is one of the most accurate depictions of a specific military campaign during the War Between the States.  Some have criticized the film for concentrating soley on three main battles, but there is signficant attention to detail and magnificently choreographed battle scenes accurately portray the spirit of the July 1863 battle in the film's four-hour plus running time.  Martin Sheen's portrayal of beloved Confederate General Robert E. Lee has taken considerable flak.  Many Civil War buffs do not like to see General Lee portrayed as an tired old soldier who becomes danagerously over confident, but viewers must understand that this is how Michael Shaara crafted Lee's character in the book.  Confederate General Longstreet and Union Colonel Chamberlain are clearly the story's heroes.  Both video and DVD versions are presented in a modified letterbox edition with Dolby stereo sound.

486565,5,6302548748,"Ronald Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"" is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Based on Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The Killer Angels"", this film carefully and enthrallingly details the major events of July 1, 2 and 3, 1863.  This battle, which proved to be the pivotal engagement of the American Civil War and, arguably, all of American history, is depicted, in surprisingly human terms, through the eyes of three men:  General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), legendary commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, who faces what could be the final victory or defeat of his army.  James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), Lee's second in command, who finds himself torn between loyalty to his commander, and grave misgivings about Lee's strategy.  And Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), the newly promoted Union Colonel who suddenly find his small band of battle weary troops placed in the key position of Union defense, a position that must be held at all costs.  The battle sequences are played out in appropriately grand and authentically raw fashion, with stirring music and moments of surprising poignancy, such as the beautiful and heroic spectacle of the doomed Pickett's charge.  What is perhaps most surprising though, is how compelling the non-battle scenes are.  It is quite a task to maintain audience interest for a span of more than four hours, but this picture succeeds admirably through fine introspective writing, moments of unexpected humor, and remarkable performances.  The ordinarily mediocre Jeff Daniels, for instance, turns in what may be his best screen performance and Tom Berenger is also at the top of his game.  Sam Elliot's Buford is magnificent and even C. Thomas Howell does good work.  This is a film that portrays not only history, but philosophy as well, and succeeds in showing the horror as well as the glory of this complicated war.  It is a truly remarkable film.  My only complaint is that, in compiling this DVD, the decision was made to use the theatrical cut of the film.  An excellent director's cut, with something like an extra 17 minutes of footage, has long been available on Laserdisc and should have been the cut used.  This decision is the only thing to prevent this, extra-laden, DVD from being the definitive edition of Gettysburg.",994377600,19,2289,5.0828877005347595
486566,5,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is based on Michael Shaara's novel ""The Killer Angels,"" and both works focus on this crucial battle on July 1-3, 1863 through from the perspective of five key figures: The first day of the battle is dominated by Union Calvary General John Buford (Sam Elliot), who slowed the Confederate advance to preserve the precious high ground for the Federal army.  The second day comes down to the efforts of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) and the 20th Maine, who hold the extreme left end of the Army of the Potomac at a crucial moment in the battle.  The third day focuses on the clash of wills between General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen) and his veteran commander James ""Pete"" Longstreet (Tom Berenger), who have been arguing offense versus defense throughout the battle, climaxing in the fatal finality of Pickett's Charge.  The focal figure of the Charge is Confederate General Lowell Armistead (Richard Jordan), who must attack the position defended by his best friend Winfield Scott Hancock, made all the more poignant by the fact that this was Jordan's final role; he died from a brain tumor the same year this film was released.
However, it is the character of Chamberlain who emerges as the hero from this film.  Chamberlain was featured as well in the celebrated PBS documentary ""The Civil War,"" and the result is that he has become the idealized citizen-soldier or gallant knight of the Union army.  The result of his military and political career is almost as fascinating as his defense of Little Round Top, for which he received the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Jeff Daniel's performance is certainly the finest of his career to date, and he gets to give an eloquent speech on the Civil War as a fight to make other men free.  His interplays with veteran Sergeant ""Buster"" Kilrain (Kevin Conway) deal with the war on a philosophical level, which is not surprising because the man is a college professor.  But in the heat of battle he proves himself, and while we cannot imagine ourselves being Robert E. Lee, we can identify with Chamberlain.  The end result is that the best part of the film comes not at the end, but before the intermission.
This DVD has some excellent extra features.  Side A offers the 1950 documentary ""Battle of Gettysburg,"" narrated by Leslie Nielsen, which tells the story of the battle entirely in terms of shots of the hundreds of monuments and statues covering the National Battlefield in Pennsylvania.  ""The Making of 'Gettysburg,'"" the other main feature is on Side B, and does a nice job of capturing the sense of reverence the actors and reenactors had for making this movie on locations in and around the actual battlefield.  There is also an interview gallery, theatrical trailer and four televison spots, on location footage and battlefield maps.  The commentary track, which is only for selected scenes and not the entire film, focuses primarily on the actual Battle of Gettysburg.  Unlike most commentaries, what you will find here matches up with what is happening on screen and there are several sections keyed to specific shots or lines of dialogue, which is much appreciated.  In addition to applauding the historical accuracy of the film, McPherson and Symonds make a fascinating case for Lee's logic in ordering Pickett's Charge.  Shaara had based parts of his novel on Longstreet's memoirs, and since Lee died without ever writing his own, a case can be made that the historical record is somewhat skewed.  They also do a bit of debunking regarding Chamberlain's decision to do a bayonet charge.  Maxwell's most interesting section is when he talks about how they studied the films of Kurosawa and other masters to come up with the best way of shooting battles sequences, which resulted in setting up difficult dolly shots for the Battle on Little Round Top.  Civil War buffs will enjoy this commentary much more than film students, but that is totally appropriate for this particular film.
Every year I watch ""Gettysburg"" on the four days covered in the film, June 30 and July 1-3 (then on the 4th of July I watch ""1776"").  Only ""Glory"" is on this level in terms of depicting Civil War battles.  This film touches me with the opening credits, where the photographs of these real soldiers are replaced with those of the actors playing them.  This is quite evocative, especially when Randy Edleman's evocative score swells as we see the face and name of George Pickett.  Even if you have never seen this movie you have undoubtedly heard Edleman's score, which has been used to advertise several films and for the closing credits of the Olympics broadcast.  It should have been nominated for an Oscar.",994118400,2,4683,4.891276864728193

Lee screwed up at Gettysburg when he wouldn't listen to Longstreet and that was depicted with brilliance in the movie. Gettysburg was Lee's greatest blunder and I'd rather watch a movie showing him as a human being than as some saintly untouchable Southern icon myth.
Ted Turner put this movie together brilliantly, especially the largest collection of Civil War artillary ever fielded for an event, over 300 Napolion 20 pound field guns were used in the artillary duel before Picket's charge.
Sadly, Richard Jordon was lost to cancer after this movie, what a great actor, I will never forget his performance as Lou Armsted.",985392000,5,850,4.828767123287672
486606,4,6302548748,"Gettysburg is an epic film on a scale that is rarely seen anymore.  In the tradition of great war films it pulls you into the struggle and lets you feel the intensity and desperation of the common soldier.  The cast is enormous. No CGI effects here.  Every soldier on screen is a LIVE human participant.
THE GOOD:  Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain and Richard Jordan as General Armistead.  Both give extremely moving performances.  These two are the heartbeat of the film.  Without them, it would not be worth watching.
THE BAD:  Unlike ""Glory"", with its graphic portrayal of war,  ""Gettysburg"" appears somewhat tame in its depiction of violence.  No doubt this is due to the fact that the film was originally slated for television release, but it seems strange that the bloodiest battle in American history would have less on-screen blood than a Disney film.  However, there is one incredible scene where several charging Confederates get shot with an artillery blast at point-blank range.
THE UGLY:  Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Lee is atrocious.  None of Lee's genius is depicted in the film.  Was the General insane or just incompetent? ""Gettysburg"" lets you choose for yourself.  At any rate, the role was either grossly miscast or misdirected.
 All in all, ""Gettysburg"" is a solid film that will compel you to get lost in the drama.  It is a triumph that would have never been produced had it not been for Ted Turner's love of the Civil War.  It's a BIG commitment (4 and 1/2 hours) but one that is well worth the time.

The first half of the movie seems to move more smoothly and quickly than the second half (which is why I only gave it four stars).  The main reason for this, I feel, is the superb acting by Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as General Buford.  Both of their performances are truly masterful.
The second half moves more slowly but is still worth watching. The battle scenes are extremely well done and I particularly appreciated the fact that the movie was actually filmed in and around Gettysburg and in the park itself.
I felt that the weakest characterization was that of Robert E. Lee, for while Martin Sheen's acting performance was technically well done, I did not feel he captured the essence of Lee's personality.

I wasn't enthralled to be watching this movie, but my father-in-law had purchased it after visiting Gettysburg, and wanted to point out where he had stood, overlooking the field (I think he might have been a drummer during the actual battle...no, no--just kidding!) So, it was with heavy heart that I sat down to watch this movie. I wasn't impressed so much with Sheen, or Berenger (Sheen was too heavy handed, in my humble opinion, and Berengers beard should have been given a supporting actor nod, but it was far too fake!). Then, I saw Jeff Daniels. Could this be the same Jeff Daniels that starred in Dumb and Dumber? I couldn't believe it. Actually, I didn't recognize him at first, but was already taken back by his strong performance. As the story line grew, I became more and more thrilled at watching Daniels perform. I realized that I missed something in all the movies I had ever seen him in--he is an artist, who can carefully craft his work into something that can surpass time. I have seen pleasantville, and was pleased by his performance in that, but this is beyond anything that I could have hoped for. I am now in the process of looking up all of his movies, as he has won himself a fan.
I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, if for no other reason then to watch Daniels earn his pay. Give up four hours of your life, and you will be pleasantly surprised, I am sure!",982972800,2,1439,4.4961832061068705

I think there should have been more details about the second day then there was. Not once in the movie was the bloody fight of the first Minnesota mentioned (The book passively mentioned it). However, the drama of Chamberlain's charge gets me every time I see it, as does Pickett's charge. To top it off, Randy Edelman's soundtrack is beautiful and appropriate.

You learn about the personality of the leaders of both sides of the battle, and you begin to feel for both of them. Martin Sheen is wonderful as Gen. Lee, and he shows the man to be warm and compassionate to his fellow soldiers and countrymen. Tom Beringer shows the same grit and determination in his role, as a man tested to the end.
The choreography is excellent, with literally thousands of extras involved. I own the VHS version, but if you plan to buy it on DVD, you will get a full-length audio commentary full of facts about the battle. the film take it's sweet time, and is several hours long, but it gives the filmaker time to show the details of the way war was and still is fought, with all the emotions showed in full.

486625,5,6302548748,"One is used to viewing historical movies with the knowledge that what you are seeing is not real history, but simply based on historical events.  Gettysburg is not only based on history but is an accurate portrayal of the most famous battle of the Civil War.  The movie is amazing accurate, but is far from a documentary.  It does a wonderful job of intertwining historical fact and drama.
While the battle scenes are well done, especially the battle for Little Round Top, the movie excels in the personal stories.  The interplay of the West Point comrades in the Union and Confederate armies is especially touching.  Particular attention is rightly devoted to Confederate General Armistadt and Union General Hancock.  These two long time friends truly cared deeply for each other and knew that they would face each other during Pickett's charge.  The fact that they lay wounded, Armistadt mortally, feet from each other, provides further irony.
Another strength of the movie the fact that it takes on the tough historical questions that the battle raised - the chief one being whether Lee should have engaged Meade at Gettysburg or elsewhere.  The conflict is brought to the screen through crisp dialogue between Lee and Longstreet.  The dialogue is first class; however other than the fact that the failure of Pickett's charge may have proved Lee wrong the broader historical aspects of Lee's decisions are not dealt with.
This was a great movie.  Even though I knew the outcome before the movie started I enjoyed it and have watched it several times.  At times I felt that I was with General Burford and the Iron Brigade at Cemetery Ridge, General Chamberlain and the 20th Maine atop Little Round Top or General Pickett as he began his ill fated charge.

486626,2,6302548748,"...and that is my biggest problem with this movie, hence only two stars.  Unlike the Movie produced by Turner, General Lee was far from confused about his invasion of the North in 1863.  And while he did rely heavily on Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry for his intelligence and to screen the main Army's movements, Turner made it look as though Stuart's absence was one of the main reasons for the Confederate defeat...which certainly wasn't the case.  And Lee wasn't without Cavalry, as Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry was on hand.  Another problem I had was this movie also made Longstreet look more brilliant and even-headed than Lee.  While Longstreet was an able commander, especially at the Corps and Division level, he was no Lee.
I enjoyed the story line and the focus on the first day's actions with Maj. General John Buford holding Seminary Ridge against overwhelming odds.  I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain, and his speech prior to the action on Little Round Top.  And Pickett's Charge made me weep.  But, my Southern Pride (I was born in Tennessee and raised in Kentucky) was stung by the confused and indecisive prortrayal of Lee by Martin Sheen (someone seemed to forget that General Lee was over six feet tall and rather angular, Sheen being considerably shorter and less angular...).  General Lee certainly did have a reason for invading the North and wasn't as confused as portrayed in this film.
Besides General Lee's portrayal, a very Historically accurate film, and good entertainment.",978998400,16,1530,4.9921259842519685
486627,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" brings one of the best Civil War novels ever written to colorful life. This is a movie about a battle, no doubt about it, and the filmakers have avoided trying to appeal to the widest range of people. Those looking for period romance should look elsewhere.
Gettysburg was the pivotal battle in the Eastern theatre of the Civil War, with the Federal army winning the only clear-cut victory they were to achieve after Malvern Hill. The movie follows five main characters:Union Brigadier General John Buford, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the Union 20th Maine, rebel Brigadier General Lewis Armistead, rebel Lieutenant General James Longstreet, and rebel General Robert E. Lee. Through these men the story of the Battle of Gettysburg is told.
The filming is well done, but as the movie was orginally intended for release as a TV miniseries, the resolution is low. Reenactors were used to depict the two mighty armies who clashed in Pennsylania in July, 1863. They know their hobby: uniforms are meticulously accurate and the view of army life in camp and upon the field of glory feels right. That said, some of the reenactors are pretty overweight, and the Confederates especially lack that ""lean and hungry"" look that period sources describe.
Several key portions of the battle are covered in depth. The first day is probably the best done: Buford's skillful defense of the high ground to the south of Gettysburg, the rout of the Union right, and the death of General Reynolds are all shown, and the viewer feels the ebb and flow of the fight. The second day focuses on the action at Little Round Top, and that is all. This appraoch works well in the movie, but the climactic fight around the Peach Orchard, the Wheat Field, and Culp's Hill is overlooked. The third day gives up the chance to show us the clash of sabers as Custer charges Stuart's tired troopers and Kilpatrick sacrifices his men in a series of headlong charges against Confederate infantry. Instead, the movie makers choose to focus on Pickett's charge. It is VERY well done. Long lines of rebel infantry advance on the angle, and the enormity of their defeat is readily apparent.
The performances are all top-notch. Martin Sheen's Lee is not quite the charismatic leader of men that the real Lee was, but his agonizing over decisions and simple faith in God will help viewers to identify with the great man. John Buford is played extremely well by veteran Western actor Sam Elliot. But the best performances are turned in by Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain.
Look for Ted Turner, playing a rebel officer, to get shot down during Pickett's charge, and Civil War filmmaker Ken Burns, as a Federal staff officer begging General Hancock to seek cover during the Confederate bombardment.",978134400,38,2797,4.90295358649789

486651,5,6302548748,"When Hollywood attempts to re-enact history, they usually fall into one of several traps.  They might try to superimpose a fictional romance over the whole thing... or tell the story through the eyes of an overblown super-hero... and if that item of history happens to be a war, they usually use enough fake blood to sail a ship on.  Usually they just wind up forgetting the historical part, and produce a film with enough violence to appeal to men with short attention spans, and enough romance to appeal to women with short attention spans.
Thankfully, ""Gettysburg"" fell into NONE of these traps.  What was created is extremely accurate, with only enough ""add-ins"" to tell the story of how history's players were likely to have fealt almost 140 years ago.  This IS history!
Tastefully done, the film portrays the emotional and physical struggles of the men who fought the Battle of Gettysburg, and pays great tribute to the 53,000 who lost their lives there.  There is no extreme gore here... as I said, it IS tastfully done.
It is also a film for an intelligent audience.  You MUST pay attention (which is something I had no trouble with).  This movie has NOT been dumbed down for an audience with a short attention span, as so many others have.  You WILL learn some history here, folks.
I must congradulate whoever was in charge of casting... the actors actually LOOK like the characters they portray!  To illustrate this, they actually compare the actors' photos to old ""tin-type"" photos of the historical persons they are performing as.  Excellent acting and dialog are present throughout... and none of the actors, no matter HOW famous, dominates the movie.  (It would have been all too easy to allow one big 'star' to turn the entire thing into a glorification of himself!)  Definately classic acting in the 'old school' style.
At over 4 hours long, and considering its accurate content, it is sure to become a classic with Civil War historians, re-enactors, and the general public alike...",976838400,3,1998,4.8613569321533925
486652,5,6302548748,"Why do I give Gettysburg 5 stars?  Here's why:
 1.  This is one of the few films that really stays true to the novel it was based upon (The Killer Angels) - the directors and writers do take a little leeway, but it is very minimal, and I applaud them for sticking to the book.
 2.  The acting and the screenplay in this film really give the viewer an excellent understanding of both sides, North and South, as well as several of the individual players from each side (Chamberlain and Hancock from the Union, and numerous figures from the South - Lee, Longstreet, Armistead among others).  What this accomplishes is that there is a lot of sympathy generated for both sides - even though the Southern cause is not PC today, slavery enters into the film a lot less than does simply the Southern desire for independence.  For the North, Chamberlain explains towards the beginning (to paraphrase) 'some of us came because we wanted adventure, because we thought it would be fun, others came out of a sense of duty or honor.  Others came simply because it was the right thing to do'.
 3.  The cinematography and overall look of the film are very well done, especially picket's charge.  The only quible most folks seem to have is the 'phoney' beards - I admit on a few characters they do seem phoney, but most seem to be pretty good - and the film certainly does not coward away from this fact - during the opening credits a photo of the actor for each major character is cross faded into a photo of the actual person.
 4.  Although its probably 'dumbed down' a little, especially in the script, the movie does a good job explaining the strategies and tactics involved.  Most movies on similar subjects simply assume that the viewer is not intellegent enough to understand this and so it simply gets glossed over.  Gettysburg's only flaw here is that it goes out of its way too much to explain the strategy, as the dialogue often features the characters explaining and rather ackwardly re-explaining the tactics.  Net result is that the film seems to think that the viewers are intellegent enough to understand, but only after its drummed into their brains 5 times.
 5.  The acting is first rate thoughout the film, particulary the emotions captured by the actors.  Armistead and Chamberlein in particular are very well acted by Jordan and Daniels.  I don't think anyone who has seen Gettysburg could help but get chills up and down their spine when Chamberlein calls for the bayonet charge to defend the Little Round Top and screams his call for ""Bayonets!"" at the top of his lungs.  Armistead, though, in particular steals the show in the second half of the film and has all of the most emotional lines of dialogue.  First, he illuminates the Southern cause by explaining to a British observer how all of his men are 'sons of Virginia', concluding by saying (to paraphrase, again) ""Go back and tell your queen, tell her that ALL of Virginia was here today"".  Then he exaults his men to charge the field even though he and they know they will suffer massive casualties - ""Virginians!  Virginians!  For your lands!  For your homes!  For your sweethearts!  For your wives!  For Virginia!  Forward, march!""  As the charge gets pinned down to spur his men on he steps forward into the fire and screams ""Virginians!  Who will come with me?"", stabbing his sword through his hat and pointing it forward to show the way as he surges forward.  But, without doubt the most emotional and best line comes as he is lying wounded at the Union position - particularly since this is the film's best moment in capturing the real tragedy of the civil war - that it was fought brother against brother and friend against friend. Having previously explained through a couple of scenes how he and union General Hancock were best of friends before the war, he asks if he can be allowed to speak to Hancock.  When he is told that Hancock, too, has been wounded, the devestation that the real Armistead probably would have felt is captured perfectly as he emotionaly cries out in obvious physical and emotional pain ""No!  Not both of us!  Not ALL of us!  Please, God!""
 Gettysburg is not without its flaws - it probably doesn't really capture everything that went on at the battle, its a bit long at 4+ hours and starts out quite slowly, and the music is overly dramatic in some places and poorly edited in in others - but its positive aspects more than make up for this, which is why I strongly recommend this film to anyone who loves great cinema.",976579200,7,4518,4.608260325406758

I have an extensive DVD collection, and if you have experienced what I have, among them are the great quality transfers and some real dogs.  Gettysburg might well be THE finest transfer I've seen.  The video (I play it on a widescreen HDTV) and audio are outstanding.  I must emphasize that the video delivers unbelievable clarity, perhaps the best I've seen. Clearly, the careful attention to detail and loving recreations that were the foundation for the original movie have been carried to the DVD with that same committment.  It is refreshing to see a studio that REALLY cares about its product.
As an aside, I should also mention I am an amateur Civil War historian focused on the battle of Gettysburg and of course find the film an outstanding, albeit limited, short history of the battle.  This DVD will expand other people's knowledge if they avail themselves of the feature length commentary, especially the portions by James McPherson from Princeton U.

This is a great movie and maximum credit goes to all those involved, especially the amateur soldiers with their authentic uniforms, original guns, etc. It faithfully portrays men, how they talk, how they behave, and how they feel, without the sickening sentimentality that seems to infect all the Hollywood offerings, apparently to gain female acceptance.  I had wondered how well the producers could create a film from a time when there were no movie cameras, or other like material, but the job has been done so superbly that from time to time you realize with a start that what you are watching is not an original combat film, but a re- creation.  Comment has been made on the mustaches. I have quite a large collection of daurogertypes of relatives from NY state, Ohio, etc.of that time period, and believe me, they have captured the style of facial adornment of those days.

The widescreen image is very good with only a few digital artifacts. While the film, like the book, touches mainly on the high points of the battle, those points are depicted fairly accurately. While 19th century warfare is difficult to imagine let alone depict, the film does an excellent job of showing the confusion and carnage without a lot of gore. Its very difficult to watch the 20th Maine stand on Little Round Top and not get goosebumps. The acting in this film is outstanding, the actors all seem to realize the power of the material they are given and Gettysburg has the ability to suspend time and draw the viewer into the film. One thing I love is that many scenes are put together like Mort Kunstler paintings giving the movie a classic look and feel. I do miss the Low Frequency Effects channel (and thus only giving 4 stars) Without it, Alexanders cannonade of the Union center is very good. With it, the cannonade would have been awesome and guaranteed complaints from the neighbors.

486665,4,6302548748,"Let me get this out first: I'm thankful ""Gettysburg"" has finally made its way onto DVD. Still the awe-inspiring film that I remember, the digital and audio transfer seems to be even better than the laser disc version. But the features could have been so much more....and that is a lingering issue for me.
My main problem is the commentary: Ron Maxwell and his director of photography Kees Van Oostrum take a big back seat to two (that's right, two) distinguished historians. I'm sorry, but whoever's going to purchase this DVD is probably not going to need cliff notes from two history tutors on why the Civil War was fought and what General So-and-So's motives were. If I wanted that, I would read a book (and Mr. MacPherson is kind enough to suggest his own work at one point). I was genuinely looking forward to hearing what Maxwell and Van Oostrum would have to say about various sequences and dialogues. Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD have opted to delagate most of the talking time to our scholars (it seems the four gentlemen featured on the commentary track were recorded at seperate times). I just don't get how this opportunity was fumbled.
But enough whining. The theatrical trailers and TV spots were fun, and I especially enjoyed the ""on location"" feature. The two documentaries are also true bonuses. As for the maps and interview galleries? Perhaps an isolated score and some of the deleted scenes from the laser disc would have been vastly more appreciated. It probably would sold more copies, too. Come to think of it, if there was EVER a DVD to deserve an isolated score and deleted scene feature, this would have been it.

486666,4,6302548748,"This was a surprisingly enjoyable film. Most films about historic events of some importance in a nations past tend to lay on the saccharine by the bucket load.  Further there is often a tendency to make films on the basis that most of the audience is brain dead and every simple element has to be explained. The makers of Gettysburg don't fall into these traps and are happy to let the narrative bubble along and tell us what happened.
The battle is generally seen as a significant event in the history of the United States. General Lee had won a series of remarkable victories against a number of timid union generals. At every turn Lee had generally been outnumbered and out gunned.  He hoped that by defeating Meade he could negotiate and peace which would allow the South to remain independent and to continue the slave system.
This however was not to be and over the three day of the battle Lee and his subordinates made a series of mistakes which allowed Meade to hand on and emerge victorious. As a result the battle is seen as the high tide of the fortunes of the Confederacy. From then on the victories vanished and defeat followed defeat.
In America the soldiers of both sides have always been admired. Lee seemed to be a decent gentlemanly type of man even if he was fighting for a cause which we could now hardly understand. The union was fighting for values which were timeless. One of the strengths of the film is that those American viewers from the South can cheer at the bravery and courage of their side and the Northern viewers can cheer at the philosophical speeches made by their side.
The actors in the film look like the originals. Martin Sheen is the perfect Lee a quietly spoken gentleman who is shattered at the failure of Pickets charge. Longstreet, Picket and the others all fit into their parts.
The film goes for four hours but it seems shorter than that. Well worth a watch.",975974400,7,1905,4.551020408163265
486667,4,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is one of the more ambitious film projects in recent memory; it tries very hard to be historically accurate and make that history entertaining.
Unforunately, ""Gettysburg"" fails on the second count, but the events and ideas in this film are so compelling that you can't help but be swept up in it.
Think of this film as the best history lecture you'll ever attend and you'll get the idea; like a lecture, ""Gettysburg"" is chock full of facts, and like the best lectures, it's absolutely compelling. But you don't expect a lecture to have real emotional punch, and except for isolated moments, ""Gettysburg"" doesn't either.
The star of this film is the history of the battle itself, which is re-created on the actual battlefields of Gettysburg by thousands of Civil War re-enactors. We learn about the strategies of both sides, the fateful decisions and why they were made, and even get a glimpse into the humanity of the men who fought.
It bears mentioning that this film doesn't even mention slavery, the issue that caused the Civil War. It would have been easy to demonize the Confederates for fighting for slavery (or, as ""The Patriot"" did, gloss over the subject completely), but instead, we see them simply as men who fought for a bad cause. That they fought nobly for that cause adds an extra layer of depth and richness to this history.
The only count this film failed on, in my opinion, was making the key players portraits instead of real characters. They talk a lot about what the war means (usually accompanied by swelling music), but the overall effect is to make them portraits, not real characters, and the talented group of actors portraying them seem to be sleepwalking.
Only Confederate General Armistead (Richard Jordan, in his last role) comes off as a true character with a problem we can relate to: his best friend from West Point is at Gettysburg fighting for the Union. His speech about the sad situation is absolutely heartbreaking, and brings one of the real tragedies of the war into sharp relief.
I wish the filmmakers had done the same thing for other characters, especially Robert E. Lee.

The parts of the actual battle that are portrayed here are accurate as well as true to the book (Killer Angels). Remember though- it is not a portrayal of the battle as a whole- merely select portions and patricipants.
Tom Berenger firmly cemented my view that Longstreet is one of the most interesting and complex generals in the war, and Jeff Daniels portrays Chamberlain with a thoughtful and learned air that makes you forget he's also capable of such broad humor as ""Dumb and Dumber.""

It's most agreeable that Richard Jordan's portrayal of Confederate Brigadier Gen. Armisted was admirable; a complex part to play, considering Armisted's divided sympathies between both devotion to the State of Virginia and his love for the Union's Hancocks. What a performance Jordan handed in before he died! Not to mention Martin Sheen's equally admirable performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee - I must admit that I wouldn't go see Gettysburg because I didn't think Sheen would carry the role well: He's a dead-ringer for Gen. Ulysses S. Grant!! 1960s TV great Andrew Prine's return to the screen as Confederate General Garnett is as cool as Hitcher star C. Thomas Howell's Lieutenant Thomas Chamberlain (borther of Col. Chamberlain).
The action scenes in here were superbly done ... Little Round Top's surprised me, but Pickett's Charge in this film has no past comparison and is the most impressive I've ever seen: With few or no special effects, as Braveheart had aplenty, it pushed the envelope in dedication to the ""Passion of Gettysburg"" - so well carried out by the reactivated Civil War units on the same historical locations.

486698,5,6302548748,"(Review updated July 25, 2015)

""Gettysburg"" is one of my all-time favorite war films!  It re-creates the Civil War's battle of Gettysburg with superb acting, an excellent screenplay, a hauntingly beautiful musical score, and some of the  most authentic and stirring battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie.

Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The  Killer Angels,""  this film follows the principal characters, and  chronicles the main events, which occurred at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from  July 1-3, 1863.  The events depicted in the film are notable for their  historical accuracy.  Some of the most exciting battle scenes in the film  are General John Buford's engagement with the Confederates on  the high  ground north of Gettysburg on July 1; the defense of Little Round Top by  Colonel Joshua Chamberlain's 20th Maine on the following day; and, of  course, Pickett's Charge on the final day of the  battle.  The battle  scenes contain plenty of smoke and fire, but are done  without copious displays of blood and gore.

The acting in ""Gettysburg"" is  excellent throughout.  Jeff Daniels , who portrays Chamberlain, probably  gives the best overall performance, but Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Tom  Berenger (Gen. James Longstreet), Sam Eliot (Buford,) Stephen Lang (Gen.  George Pickett), and Kevin Conway (Sergeant Kilrain) also give performances  which are outstanding for their realism, grittiness, and historical  accuracy.  Special mention must also go to the late Richard Jordan, whose  portrayal of Confederate General Louis Armistead was consistently eloquent  and moving.

I originally purchased ""Gettysburg"" in 1999, when it was available only in VHS format. Over the past fifteen years, it has also been released in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. The Blu-ray version is the first to contain the entire film, uninterrupted,  on one disc. It corrects most of the technical flaws found in previous releases, making it, of course, technically superior to versions found on VHS and DVD. The high definition video and audio found on the Blu-ray version of ""Gettysburg"" are not what I would call reference quality, but are nevertheless excellent.

""Gettysburg"" is a long movie; it runs to just over  four hours.  Still, it held me spellbound from start to finish, mainly due  to its dramatic intensity and realistic battle scenes.  I highly recommend  this outstanding film not only to Civil War enthusiasts, but for anyone who  loves a sumptuously produced and well acted war film.",967075200,454,2518,5.275949367088607

Other actors fare much better.  Jeff Daniels gives his best  performance since Terms of Endearment as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.  Tom  Berenger is superb as Longstreet.

What are the some of the problems? First, the make-up  department needs to have their heads examined with the plethora of terribly  cheap, fake beards in the movie. Longstreet's beard, in particular, looks  like a rabid Chia pet on steroids. The real James Longstreet never had a  beard that approached the ample levels of this beard. Tom Chamberlain's  chin whiskers are also very phony looking, as is Sheen's beard as Robert E.  Lee. Jeff Daniels' mustache, as JL Chamberlain, bears a great resemblance  to Yosemite Sam. You may think this criticism is trivial, but the movie  would have been strengthened considerably by a decent make-up department.  They also need to remove the wedding rings on the major actors. The only  Civil War general who wore a wedding ring was Ulysses S. Grant and he  wasn't at Gettysburg.
Another weakness is the sheer length of the movie.  Where was the editor? There are many scenes which beg to be cut: all of the  scenes with British Colonel Freemantle are superfluous, as is the later  scenes with Confederate spy Harrison. Lee's dressing down of Stuart and  Trimble are also overly long. A good hour needs to be lopped off the  film.
The uniforms of the major participants are also laughable. Even  after a day's battle, there is never a scratch, splotch or blood stain on  any garment. This is unrealistic. The lack of carnage and blood in all the  battles is also unrealistic.
Another criticism is the age and weight of  the reenactors in the film. Most seem to be in their 40's and almost all  are 100 pounds too heavy to be accurate in their bit roles. The average  Confederate soldier at Gettysburg was 20 years old and weighed 140 pounds,  some of these extra's are Orson Welles look alikes!
But... and this is a  *big* ""but..."" Jeff Daniels performance as Chamberlain is  outstanding, he carries the first half of the film. The scene at Little  Round Top is superlative and moving. Tom Berenger as Longstreet carries the  second half of the movie, even with his grotesque Chia-pet fake beard.  Berenger is thoughful and excellent in his role. Martin Sheen makes a  ridiculous and too-short Robert E. Lee and his accent is hardly that of a  Patrician Virginian, more like a Georgia dirt farmer.

486718,5,6302548748,"The TNT production of ""Gettysburg"" presents a detailed, insightful look into the action and the souls of men like those who fought in this, the bloodiest battle in the history of US military encounters.
The story of the multiple day battle traces the initial movements of the  opposing forces, federal and confederate, the initial skirmishes, and the  desperate battle to hold the high ground -- ground that will eventually  play a telling role in the outcome of this pivotal encounter.  It also  shows the attack of on Little Round Top, and the last-ditch effort of the  Confederates to break the middle of the Union line.
The portrayals of  actual historical figures who played prominent roles in the battle are  outstanding -- though some historians doubt that the bayonette charge down  Little Round Top actually unfolded in such an organized fashion.
This  film clearly shows the devasting ability of modern weapons to take life,  and the insignificant ability we have to preserve it amidst such ferocious  fighting.
""Gettysburg"" shows the two opposing side's  objectives: 1) to preserve the union, by federal forces; and 2) to preserve  individual rights of choice and self-government (stemming from the question  on slavery) by confederate forces.
The casting of main parts is  excellent, and the use of literally thousands of volunteer extras who  regularly participate in Civil War re-enactments makes the movie gel.  The  basis for the movie, the book ""The Killer Angels"" is an excellent  read, and is a great introduction to the Battle at Gettysburg -- the battle  that was the beginning of the end for the Confederate Army.

486750,5,6302548748,"July 1,2,3 of 1863 were pivotal days in our country's history. ""Gettysburg"" does an admirable job of summing up the actions and emotions of this battle in about 4 hours. This is the best Civil War movie  that you are ever going to see. Why is it so good? Here are a number of  reasons:
ONE: The Acting...There is a good amount of solid actors playing  key roles in this movie. Sam Elliot, Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels, and Tom  Berenger are the big names. They are supported by other very good actors.  They play their parts with proper accents and believability.
TWO:  Balance...Some Civil War movies almost make the South seem like the bad  guys (""Glory"" comes to mind). No matter what part of the country  you are from, as you watch ""Gettysburg"" you feel for the fighters  on both sides. You understand the tough choices they had to make as this  movie spends even time in both army camps. In a normal movie, I would have  expected the Pickett's Charge scene to be a story of the Northerner's great  stand. In this movie, both the South and the North are given their due  during this key assault.
THREE: Personal Stories...This movie isn't just  about the nuts & bolts of the battle (who was stationed here, who  charged there etc...), but it also does a phenomonal job of telling the  stories mostly of the key officers in this battle: Buford, Stuart,  Chamberlain, Lee, and Longstreet. One part that was especially done well  was the struggle between two close friends, Armistead (CSA) and Hancock  (USA).
FOUR: Soundtrack...Very appropriate and beautiful music during  different parts of the battle.
I could go on, but I think this  highlights the strengths of this great movie. It's one that's well worth  watching.",960595200,102,1720,4.720538720538721
486751,5,6302548748,"This movie can be described in two words: simply brilliant!  The movie based upon Michael Shaara's novel ""The Killer Angels"" is very well interpreted and expressed.

In addition to excellent entertainment  value, it is extremely educational and I highly recommend it to anyone  doing any type of research about the Battle of Gettysburg of the American  Civil War.

At Gettysburg we bought a tape-tour and spent the day reviewing the conflict.  Having watched the movie prior to the visit, the whole battle came to life.  We deeply felt the losses of each side, and developed a gratitude for the  sacrifice of union and confederate soldiers.",957312000,,404,5.0
486753,4,6302548748,"There's really not much I can add to what's been said here. The actors performances all around were outstanding, and the production values first rate. Cudo's to the Producers for the innovative decision to use Civil War  reenactors as extras. One can only imagine the sense of pride, and the  lifetime of memories  these men experienced in reliving this most important  of battles on such a grand scale.  There's been some debate here  regarding which people and parts of the historical battles were left out. I  agree it's a shame that so much couldn't be included. However, I agree with  one person that including the entire three day battle would have given us a  film that was about eight hours long. (Not that I would have considered  this a bad thing of course.)  In any case, if viewers are like me,  they'll naturally assume on their own that a lot was left out, and be  inspired to head down to their local library to find out more. That's  certainly what I did first thing. Also kicking myself for not visiting more  Civil War sites while growing up on the east coast. The possibility alone  of inspiring curiosity should in itself make this movie required viewing in  every High school history class. It's properly dramatic, tells a balanced  view of both sides, and is certainly exciting enough to hold even the most  attention-deprived teenagers interest.
  The only real negative I found  here is the serious lack of blood in the film. War is a very bloody  business, and GETTYSBURG seems to be fully in the  `shoot-people-and-they-fall-down' school of moviemaking. The complete  opposite of say, GLORY. I can somewhat understand the reasoning behind  this, since it was partially made to be shown on television, and a lot of  blood and guts would distract from the magnificence of the story and  perhaps even turn off some potential viewers who'd get a lot out of it.  Still, for this lack of realism I have to demote one star from the  rating.
  This is another film that badly needs a DVD release. A 2-disk  set with deleted footage, directors/historian commentary track, and a copy  of the `Making of...' special would send this right to the top of my must  have list. Let's hope the folks at Turner productions have this in mind  someday.  Buy this film, preferably in letterboxed format. You will NOT be  dissapointed.",957139200,2,2338,4.7525
486754,5,6302548748,"The archtypical battle of the Civil War is well-portrayed in this adaptation of Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"".  Like the book, and to its credit, the film is more about the men than the  battle.
The first half of the film focuses primarily on Joshua Lawrence  Chamberlain and the actions of the 20th Maine at Little Round Top.  This  professor-turned-soldier, superbly played by Jeff Daniels, was perhaps the  finest embodiment of the American ideal of the citizen soldier - not born  to war, but prepared to pick up the sword when necessary.  Thoughtful, yet  decisive; compassionate, but resolute.
The second half of the film deals  with the final day of battle - Pickett's Charge.  Generals Lee (Martin  Sheen) and Longstreet (Tom Beringer) are examined - Lee's firm (though, in  this case, flawed) generalship, and Longstreet's internal struggle between  doing his duty or following an order that might (and did) cost hundreds of  lives.
Throughout the film, other noteworthy performances are to be found  as well.  Sam Elliot is inspiring as General Buford, Union hero of the  first day of battle.  Sergeant ""Buster"" Kilain, played by Kevin  Conway, well demonstrates the sort of ""ordinary courage"" that  many people today (myself included) find so extraordinary.
But perhaps  the single best performance in the film is that of the late Richard Jordan  in the role of Confederate General Lewis Armistead - his last film role.  The story of Armistead and his friend, Union General Hancock, is the entire  Civil War writ small - brother against brother, friend against friend.  Armistead's filial affection for Hancock is examined, and his courage under  fire and inspiring leadership show well during the scenes of Pickett's  Charge.
Most interestingly, none of the characters comes off as a *bad*  person - everyone is a good guy, everyone is a sympathetic character.  Previous reviews notwithstanding, the men who fought the Civil War were  often deeply religious, and this is well portrayed [unlike so many films  these days which tend to mock people of faith (particularly Christians)].  To me, this goodness only heightens the tragedy of America's bloodiest  war.
But...
The movie isn't just about people, but events as well.  The  re-creations of the elements of the overall battle are superbly done,  thanks in no small part to the thousands of Civil War reenactors who  participated (gratis) in the making of this film.  The combat at Little  Round Top is accurate (within the bounds of filmmaking), but most  impressive was the entire Pickett's Charge sequence - thousands and  thousands of men walking the same ground as did those men who marched to  their fates in 1863; it nearly brought a tear to my eye to see it.
There are not enough superlatives to describe this film.  It is utterly  magnificent.
This was and is my favorite film.  Buy it.",955756800,35,2867,5.02991452991453
486755,4,6302548748,"I hate made-for-tv-movies.  Ninety-nine percent of these movies are unadulterated trash, and I can count the good ones without taking my shoes off.  After reading all the reviews, I decided (very hesitantly) to take a  chance with ""Gettysburg"", and I'll tell you now that I'm glad I did.
I'm  no civil war buff, but if there was one thing that could coerce me to go  out and research the civil war it was this movie (along with a multi-part  PBS special on that war).  Matter-of-fact, I intend to seek out and  purchase the book ""Killer Angels"" as well as the PBS special.
Obviously,  not everything in this movie was done to perfection.  There are scenes that  don't quite work.  The mass attacks that showed hand-to-hand combat are  extremely difficult to pull off in any movie.  It's almost impossible to  find a film that can handle these scenes with the realism and ferocity that  is required, and this film was no exception.  One could easily tell that  these were only actors and extras rolling about (sometimes doing a credible  job, often times not).  However, this is a minor quibble.  As for the fake  beards, most people of that era wore mustaches and beards that were  outlandish by today's standards, so this did not bother me at all.  Indeed,  I thought they portrayed the facial hair pretty accurately.  As far as the  portrayal of General Lee, I don't know that much about him to comment with  any authority.  However, this film didn't portray him as the military  genius I thought he must have been.  But then again, he did lose this  battle...probably the most important battle of the war, so I guess nobody  is perfect.
I agree heartily with the Amazon review, in that the climax  of the film occurred at the end of the first tape--Chamberlain's defence of  Little Round Top.  This was brilliant film making, and nothing prior to, or  after, had near as much impact.  This part alone is worth the purchase  price of the movie.  Hats off to the director and to Daniels' heartfelt  performance.  It was truly unforgettable, and ranks among the best battle  scenes ever filmed.
""Gettysburg"" was a film that detailed the great  battle with uncanny insight, not only about the heroic men who fought and  died, but also the terrible mistakes that were made.  In three days of  battle, there were more American lives lost than in the ten years of  Vietnam.  All-in-all, I found this to be a rewarding film and a real eye  opener.  Between 1 and 10, I give ""Gettysburg"" a solid 8, and I'm very  happy to have it in my movie collection.",955756800,2,2547,4.6343115124153496
486756,4,6302548748,"To my mind, the best war movies are the ones that don't try to have a  special plot, but just tell the story the best that they can. With that  criterion in mind, this is one of the best of the genre.  Of course no  movie (even one of over three hours length) can tell the whole story, but  this one comes close. With Jeff Daniels giving the performance of a  lifetime-not to mention great turns by Sam Elliot, Tom Berenger and Stephen  Lang-this epic is well worth watching. Especially powerful are the huge  cannon barrage and the many-thousand-reenactor-strong Pickett's Charge.  Only one complaint: Martin Sheen is one of my favorite actors, but here he  doesn't quite capture Robert E. Lee's reputed charisma and power.

His faith in the Bible looked cultish,  and Sheen (as Lee) appeared to be mentally unbalanced.  In regards to Lee,  a poor performance and poor casting.

Its outcome decided whether one  nation (the US), or two (the US and the CSA), would determine the course of  the next century.  Had the North lost, Great Britain and France (and,  perhaps, Germany) would have won. I'm no Ted Turner fan, but my hat's off  to him (in this instance).

In the  opening sequence, for example, we see a Confederate sentry that must weigh  300 pounds if he's an ounce. C'mon. There was no such thing as a fat  Confederate infantryman. YOU try marching hundreds of miles over the course  of two years of warfare, fighting, eating wormy bacon and green corn, and  see how much weight YOU keep on.
The two characters sitting under a tree  just as the battle was beginning to unfold, discussing the human condition,  I found a bit hard to swallow. And an Irishman talking about tolerance for  other races or cultures? Gimme a break. More of Turner's ultra-liberal  b.s.
As far as the art of movie-making went, I had a real problem with  the casting of Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. Sheen came across more like  the Ernest T. Bass character on the old ""Andy Griffith Show"" than  he did the elegant, stately Lee. What a miserable piece of casting.
And  the music. If somebody got up and walked across the room, the music SWELLED  and SWELLED and roared like it was the second coming of Christ. Whatever  happened to good, old-fashioned movie-making techniques (please see the  action movies of Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power.)
The two stars I give this  film are based solely on the scope and sense of reality conveyed in the  scene dealing with Pickett's charge, and that of Chamberlain's heroic  stand.

1). Watch the roof of Lee's  Headquarters.  There's an antenna on it. 2). Take note of the patches on  Chamberlain's shoulders.  He suddenly changes rank after Little Round Top!  3). Immediately following the first day's battle, The Chamberlain Bros are  walking into camp where Lt. Chamberlain talks to 3 prisoners. Look at the  sky as they enter that scene and see the jet trail in the sky. 4). During  the scene where Gen. Longstreet is introducing his Generals to the English  visitor, watch Darnell's positioning. As the Generals are being introduced  he switches from Longstreets side to Pickets side time and time again.",946425600,4,932,4.644171779141105
486798,5,6302548748,"I usually have little good to say about Ted Turner, but I will always have a soft spot for him because of his production of ""Gettysburg.""  It portrays the charactors in a way that makes them real.  Children do not  study history today, and Gettysburg brings to life a part of our history  that few of them understand.  The charactors are done so well that most  children who see the film care about them,and lean more about the Civil War  period.  This particular set has several additional scenes that add to the  movie.",946339200,,521,4.516129032258065
486799,5,6302548748,I think that this is a fantastic recreation of the battle of Gettysburg.  I know this because I have read 20 books on the subject.  I also enjoyed the fact that it showed the battle from both sides this helps you  understand what happened from a more broad perspective of the battle.  The  final battle scene is astounding the special effects are fantastic.  So in  other words I think this movie is great.,945388800,,406,4.47945205479452
486810,5,6302548748,"Not until I watched Gettysburg on TNT the first time, was I even interested in the Civil War. After seeing this epic on television, I immediately ran out and purchased the video. Soon after that, I began  reading just about every book I could find on the battle, and discovered  that the filmakers did their homework on this one. What makes this film so  realistic, is that they shot on the actual battlefield or close by in many  cases, and used re-enactors for many of the battle scenes, not just a group  of extras dressed up for the parts. Although Martin Sheen overworks his  characterization of General Robert E. Lee, the others do an excellent job.  You actually find yourself feeling General Pickett and General Longstreet's  (played by Tom Berringer) pain and frustration when the battle begins to go  against the South. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was when  Ted Turner (the TNT mogal) placed himself in the movie as one of the  leaders of the Virginia contingent, and dies very badly when his time  comes. Other than that, you become mesmorized by the strategy that both  armies worked to win this campaign, and the actual battle footage is so  realistic, you wonder if any of the re-enactor soldiers playing in the  movie didn't get hurt (there's one scene where a cannon shot goes off right  in front of a group, and blows them back in to the ranks). Even my young  sons have watched this 2 or 3 times with me, and has got them to ask  questions about the war. If a movie can do that to kids that are usually  more interested in the lasted fad these days, then this is a keeper. You'll  find that even the least informed history fans, will discover that this  movie has a plot line that is easy to follow, and will keep your interest  throughout the length of the film. Also, get your hands on the soundtrack,  as its quite enjoyable to listen to.",944179200,10,1876,4.485207100591716
486811,4,6302548748,"Gettysburg is a good movie, quite faithful to the book ""Killer Angels"" on which it is based.  The author of ""Killer Angels"" states in his book that his work is NOT intended to be a precise historical  reference.  Instead, it is a great story, based on historical events with a  fair amount of poetic license.
The movie is a great visual experience.  Literally thousands of volunteer re-enactors participated in the making of  the film.  These fellows would be the first to tell you that the movie is a  ""historical novel"" and not a precise re-enactment. But, that  said, no movie I have ever seen is Gettysburgs equal on the subject.  Perhaps ""Glory"" comes close.
I recommend this movie to all.",941587200,,694,4.708333333333333
486812,5,6302548748,"""Gettysburg"" is a wonderful but gut wrenching movie that should be seen by anyone who needs to put the most pivotal battle of the Civil War into context.  This movie will appeal to both Yankee and Confederate  hearts, and will get the point across that war is hell.  I went to  Gettysburg and stood at the statue dedicated to the Army of Virginia.  As I  looked across that open expanse to the ""angle"" I could only stand  there and weep.  For a moment I was transported back to a time when men  were slaughtered because they believed in a cause who's time had come and  gone in America.  And I could feel deep inside me the same cold fear that  I'm sure many soldiers felt as they waited for the command to move forward.  Mr. Death waited for many of them on Cemetary Ridge.  But they went and  did their duty.  You need to watch this video with your children.  Perhaps afterward you could discuss with them the importance of the battle  and its impact on our nation's most terrible moment.  I would also strongly  suggest that you plan a trip to Gettysburg Battlefield after seeing the  movie.  It will be well worth your time.",939168000,3,1128,4.4
486813,5,6302548748,"I am the proud owner of both editions of Gettysburg, the theatrical release and most recently the Collector's Edition.  My honest opinion?  Though the collector's edition did explain things a few things a little  better, most of the cut scenes I found unecessary and a bit cumbersome, but  if you don't know any background on the characters or the battle, it could  be quite helpful.  I adore this movie.  I must have seen it at least 15  times.  Its epic-like drama is emotional, real and passionate.  My sister  who deplores any and all types of war movies loves this movie.  She was  stunned at how very good it was.  It is a human movie.  It does the best, I  think, in showing the agony of the ""brother against brother""  aspect of the war.  All in all, I highly recommend it.",937958400,2,780,4.45
486814,5,6302548748,"Now that the extended family is virtually extinct, films like Gettysburg can fill the void left by vanished oral tradtion in the South. I learned about the War Between the States from my great grandmother and grandmother.  My own children don't live close enough to their grandparents to see them  more than a few days a year. How then, to convey to them the richness of  their Southern heritage in todays sterile, video game environment.  Gettysburg is a good tool for doing so. It is a measured, even handed  approach to the history of the war itself , as well as the battle.  The  film does not demonize the South or Southerns, and makes the point that  slavery was not of paramount importance to the common soldiers of either  side. It shows the courage and heroism of the soldiers who fought this war,  and enhances the natural pride Southerns feel in their ancestors. At a time  when national education standards are clearly promulgated to obviate any  sense of regional heritage, and to teach the young only a government  approved version of history, a film like Gettysburg is priceless. Your  money will be well spent.",937958400,4,1126,4.737113402061856
486815,5,6302548748,"I thought I would say something about this amazing Movie thatwas made in 1993.  I have seen the Movie 3 times already, and eachtime, I find something I didn't see before.  I thought the acting by the late Actor Richard Jordan, who portrayed at Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistad was very moving indeed.  I have since learnt that he had passed away just 3 months after making this Movie, and he was not well at the time of making it.  Apparently, he died of an Inoperable Brain Tumor in August 30 1993, so he never got to see the review of this magnificant Film!!  I am seriosuly thinking of purchasing the ""Collector's Edition of Gettysburg"", as I have also read some of the comments regarding this item, and think it well worth while to have.  I think this Film ""Gettysburg"", was both an emotional and heartrenching , and it makes one ponder of what these brave men did in their time!  I also correspond with a Penfriend for the last 10 years who lives in Florida, and is also very interested in the Civil War, he has told me so much, and also have read books here in Australia about the Civil War!

486819,5,6302548748,"When I first saw R. Maxwell's GETTYSBURG, it was first run, and the theatre was full to capacity.  Most in attendance were re-enactors or historians like myself.  Although the film propagandizes to a degree,  GETTYSBURG explores the energies that drove both sides during the three-day  ordeal in and near Gettysburg, PA, in July, 1863.  The Civil War was  fought heart to heart as well as hand to hand, and this film's strength--  like M. Shaara's novel, THE KILLER ANGELS, on which it is based-- is its  heart.  GETTYSBURG might have its greatest fans among history buffs, but it  remains an American story worth seeing and seeing again.  Show this film  to your children.

It's most redeeming characteristic by far is that it depicts the battle  from both sides...and leaves the viewer rooting for both.  I admired Lee's  wisdom, Longstreet's fire, Chamberlain's determination, and especially  Hancock's gruff geniality.  The scene where Chamberlain leads his brigade  in a last-ditch charge down Little Round Top is one of the best I have  seen; along with Pickett's reply to Lee after the famous charge, when Lee  instructs him to regroup his division: ""General Lee...I HAVE no  division.""

Except for the fact  that the continuity of the directors cut is lost, the movie is very  factual.  Although "" Give them the cold steel boys"" is attributed  to Gn. Armistead, it was nice to see Gn. Garnett utter the phrase to soon  before the angle was actually attacked.
  We use the movie as a visual  aide in a Civil War Course taught by myself at a local college. also, did  you notice how Col. Chamberlain goes from a Lt.
