2801639,3,B000OY8NBK,"Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney are well on the path of establishing a memorable Hollywood partnership akin to John Wayne and John Ford or Humphrey Bogart and John Huston; they have a production company together, have made many films together and have produced still others. ""The Good German"", their latest effort, is an interesting experiment. But it is more interesting as an experiment and less interesting as a film.

Captain Jacob Geismer (George Clooney), a journalist, arrives in Germany to cover the Potsdam conference at the end of World War II. Geismer was stationed in Germany before the War began, running the Associate Press bureau, and his return is bittersweet, and the town and people he once loved are in ruins. His driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire), a young Army solider, loves living in post-War Germany and works the angles to make some money, providing black market items to people, procuring counterfeit documents, anything to earn money. Geismar soon learns that his old girlfriend, Lena (Cate Blanchett) is still alive and dating Tully. Soon, it becomes apparent that someone is manipulating them to find Lena's husband, Emil, a scientist, who she claims is dead.

""The Good German"" is a difficult film to become involved in. The actors show little emotion as they move through the mechanics of the story. Perhaps this is intended, as a way of showing the effects of the war. In the book, when Geismar finds Lena, she is very sick and he nurses her back to health before they become embroiled in the plot. This is barely alluded to in the film and it changes the dynamic of their relationship. It is difficult to see why he is so interested in Lena. Yes, she is a former lover, but he knows she has been dating Tully (and `dating' is a kind word for their relationship) and has basically has become a prostitute to survive. We never learn why he is so attached to her. Because he doesn't care for her in the same way in the film, nursing her back to health as he did in the book, he doesn't ""care for her"" in the same way. Because this key relationship doesn't work, the rest of the film becomes a bit tedious.

Soderbergh has always been an innovative filmmaker. In most of his films, he experiments with various aspects of the creative process. In some, he changes color and light to produce heightened effects. In others, he plays with narrative and dialogue to create an interesting, more powerful dynamic between the characters. He has experimented with film noir, sci-fi, drama, comedy, relationship films, heist films, caper films and much more. He is a filmmaker consistently willing to push the envelope, to strengthen his skills and do something different and unusual.

""The Good German"", set in 1945, naturally lends itself to a black and white composition. But rather than take a Woody Allen approach and shoot the film in stunning, crystal clear black and white, Soderbergh decided to move backwards and play with some of the filmmaking techniques from this period. In any conversation about great black and white films, one of the titles that will come up is ""Casablanca"". The similarities between the two films are startling; both are set during the war years, involve people affected by the war, and feature doomed relationships. Soderbergh shot ""The Good German"" on sound stages in Los Angeles, much like Curtiz did with ""Casablanca"". But he went a few steps further. Using digital filmmaking techniques in combination with period lenses, lighting and sound techniques he gives the film a remarkably `authentic' look. Scenes are lit dramatically even surrealistically and whites occasionally flare as the camera pans across them. But the director also seems to have adopted some filmmaking techniques common to the period. People move in and out of frame, or approach the camera, their faces filling the screen. He has eschewed long tracking shots for a more dated directorial style.

I have read that Soderbergh directed the actors to perform in a presentational, theatrical stage style. If you look at ""Casablanca"", this would be a great way of describing Bogart's and Bergman's acting style. Yet, why is it that we remember this as a classic and I can barely remember Clooney and Blanchett's performances from watching the film yesterday? They are certainly similar, but it just doesn't work in this new film. The characters seem cold, distant and aloof and we don't really care for them.

Hopefully, Soderbergh will use some of these techniques on his next film. Now that he has a better handle on them, he should be able to use them to their advantage, possibly creating a ground breaking, memorable work.",1166572800,21,4652,4.9197452229299365
2801640,4,B000OY8NBK,"THE GOOD GERMAN is one of those films that captures the audience so much with its style and ambience that a relatively weak plot may go unnoticed.

It's on the eve of the 1945 Potsdam Conference in Berlin, and correspondent Jake Geismer (George Clooney) arrives in town to cover the festivities. Almost immediately, his wallet is stolen and, furthermore, he discovers that the girlfriend, i.e. steady hooker, of Tully (Tobey Maguire), his enlisted Army driver, is none other than Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), Jake's pre-war stringer and lover. It also soon becomes apparent that the Russians in their occupation zone have a strong interest in finding Lena's ostensibly-dead SS husband, Emil (Christian Oliver). Why? Well, because the Americans seem to want him even more, perhaps because Emil was personal secretary to a top Nazi rocket scientist. But Lena is exasperatingly closed mouthed about the whole affair, so what's she hiding?

THE GOOD GERMAN is gloriously filmed in black in white to mesh with archival footage from the time and place. Trust me, Cate's strong-featured beauty looks good in any color or lack thereof. And though my wife disagrees with me on this, Lena's character may remind one of an enigmatic Marlene Dietrich. In any case, this is Cate's second Oscar-worthy performance of 2006, the first being in NOTES ON A SCANDAL. In the meantime, George's Geismer gets the Bandini beat out of him at every turn, first by Tully, then by Soviet troops and assorted mysterious assailants. It's just not poor Jake's day.

A criticism of the film has been that Lena's ultimate secret isn't worth writing home about. True, it didn't cause me to rise from a slouch in my seat and gasp with amazement. On the other hand, it does illustrate what the director was perhaps intending to show, i.e. that the banality of evil embodied by Hitler's Third Reich depended largely on the predictable and mundane actions of its ordinary citizens. Lest we forget.",1165536000,21,1961,4.990825688073395
2801641,3,B000OY8NBK,"At a recent preview screening, Mr. Soderbergh got up to introduce the film and talked about wanting to recreate the feel of a 1940s Warner Bros. movie as directed by Michael Curtiz (it was double-featured with Casablanca)--but with a modern freedom to depict strong language, sexuality and extreme situations. This made me start worrying even before the movie began: sometimes those limitations work to a filmmaker's advantage, forcing creative solutions by which to still get the story told. In the end, I felt that Soderbergh's fascination with the style of those 1940s films had overwhelmed his storytelling skills, because none of what I saw really felt all that important.

Now don't get me wrong--I admire the fact that Soderbergh keeps trying new things, that he's constantly reaching and stretching, trying to grow artistically in every direction.  That's a big part of why I think he's one of our best filmmakers right now; but it's axiomatic that every once in a while, one of his experiments won't work (""Bubble,"" anyone?).  Because the danger is that sometimes the work will feel as if it was for Soderbergh's benefit more than his audience's, and I'm afraid that that's what happened here.

Cate Blanchett (who was born to be photographed in black-and-white) gives a great performance, but her final revelation wasn't quite as awful as I'd thought it would be, which made the whole thing feel underwhelming. George Clooney is the new William Holden, and that's a good thing, but he and Blanchett needed a better story, better told, to work with, and they just didn't get it. A real disappointment: lots of craft, but not much heart. Or rather, it seemed that all the heart got poured into the craft, not into the storytelling. Too bad; it's a Soderbergh film, and I had gone in with high expectations.",1163548800,5,1814,4.937704918032787
2801642,2,B000OY8NBK,"The people who made The Good German"" must have watched ""The Third Man"" -- and ""Casablanca"" -- a LOT of times.  Like both of those great movies, this one is also shot in black-and-white; and very well-done (so much better than the pretentious ""cinematography"" of most of the color films made these days).  It is a treat to watch.
The ""The Third Man"" plot and ambience are handled well: the devastation of Germany after WWII; and the corruption of the German people after going-through the war -- and after living under the Big Lying and the ubiquitous violence of the Nazis for 14 years.  In TGG, that corruption -- and the emergence of the Soviet Union as a new menace -- has smeared everybody else, as well: the Nuremberg war-criminals prosecutors, the American military police, and our soldiers occupying Berlin (Toby McGuire/Sidney Greenstreet).  All of these stories are well-executed.
But, the ""Casablanca"" ""romance"" sub-plot --  Clooney/Blanchett -- comes across as forced; compared to Bogart/Bergman, as it's so-clearly copied from.  Check-out the last scene.
""Casablanca"" and ""The Third Man""  both grew out of their characters, and their time-and-place; ""The Good German"" is hatched from ""an idea"" -- which almost always ends-up with something  that rings-false; as this movie does.

Shot in black and white, it captures the complete collapse of a modern country, and captures the bleakness and desperation of the time.
The story is a little difficult to follow but at that particular time in Germany's history there was zero hope of a better future. The country had been utterly devastated by the war and Berlin was a rubble pile.
Cate Blanchett's character, a Jew who had sold out her brethren to remain alive, reflects the ruined lives of millions of Germans and Berliners. They did whatever they could to stay alive, even if it meant selling out others and prostituting themselves.
Outstanding performance by Miss Blanchett.

But if you have read ""The Good German,"" or if you plan to, then this film will be a gigantic disappointment.  To do justice to the novel, a film adaptation would have to become an 8 to 10 hour mini-series.  In order to truncate the story for this movie, a number of significant characters were removed altogether, and those that remain have had traits and characteristics grafted onto them by Hollywood that were not theirs in the novel.  In effect they have become composites of multiple characters.  Those unfortunate changes make both the story and the characters altogether different.  Not slightly different, but vastly different.

Shot with 1940s era wide angle lenses to mimic the look of the film noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s, it looks instead as if it were shot with a broken 8mm camera from the early 1930s.  The film is so washed out and cheap looking, you can't imagine it could possibly have been made from an Oscar-winning director.  The casting, which should work theoretically given Kanon's characters, is a disaster.  Clooney sleepwalks his way throughout, Blanchett does what amounts to a Marlene Dietrich imitation (albeit a good one), and Tobey Maguire is staggeringly miscast as an army tough.  He's a good few inches shorter than Blanchett, which makes their love scenes (!) more comic than anything else.  Paul Attanasio has butchered the storytelling to the point where you can't understand what attracted him to the source material in the first place.

One means of getting around this hurdle was to take the position that such scientists were non-political and not involved in atrocities.

He vividly shows us the destruction but touches only superficially on the effects of that destruction.  This film, compared to the book, over-simplifies everything.

2801720,4,B000OY8NBK,"This is a contemporary film about the time we live in now, veiled and told through an analogy to post-war Berlin. The good German is Cate Blanchett's character, the good German who survived living under the international-law-breaking Hitler regime, trying to act like ""a good law-abiding German.""

Yes, film noir, yes, intriguing capture of 1940's movie techniques, yes, the ""Casablanca"" ending, and even a winking tribute to Untergang/Downfall, in the long holding shot on the chandelier, like the one Eva Bruan (Hitler's girlfriend) was dancing under in that film.

For true enjoyment, this film requires an acquired taste, based on knowledge of the real history of the immediate post-war era. With that knowledge, it is intriguing. I am not surprised by the viewers who ""didn't get it,"" or who found it pretentious or boring. I am surprised in fact, that the film was even made or released as it it, since it is so esoteric.

For me, the film offered a virtual world experience of life in post-war Berlin, ala ""The Third Man.""

Blanchett is great, so is Clooney. There is no chemistry between their characters because both are in total shock, she the more so, for having  been in the middle of a war zone for so long. Several books and films -- ""Berlin Diary"" -- document the fact that to stay alive, many otherwise respectable German women turned to prostitution with the occupying (Russian and Allied) troops.

There is also the holocaust/gestapo ""Jewish issue"" handled reminiscently to ""Schindler's List,"" and ""Playing For Time,"" as in an attractive Jewish woman might find a moment of reprieve under the right circumstances. Indeed, she is even horrifically exploited under the occupying Allied forces represented by Clooney et al.

I was fascinated, and wanted more, to see the kind of working out of issues that ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""The Reader"" pursued, for instance, since this is a similar story of wartime complicity with evil leaving a mortal scar of guilt.

The moral question this film poses, like the book ""Situation Ethics,"" and the German wartime theologian Dietrich Bonhoffer (hanged by Hitler a few days before the war ended) is ""Who is to blame? and Who is guilty?"" Is she to blame for saving her own life by turning Jews into the gestapo to be murdered? Or is he to blame for knowing she was Jewish and leaving her in wartime Germany when he fled to safety? Is she to blame for finding herself an attractive Jewish woman living in Nazi Germany? Or is he and everything he represents (the Allied American and English Establishments and Mainstream Media) to blame for not allowing Jewish immigration except in limited quotas, knowing full-well what was going to happen to them.

She chose life over poverty, arrest, imprisonment, torture, and death. So, who is guilty?

2801723,2,B000OY8NBK,"This is a tantalizing film for the movie buff to enjoy and dissect.  Director Steven Soderbergh is known for his inventive style-Traffic, Sex Lies and Videotape, Kafka.  He has produced commercial blockbusters Oceans 11, 12 and 13, Erin Brockovich.  Last year he made a four hour plus homage to the revolutionary hero and child murderer Che Guevara which he released separately in a two part effort.  He seems to like George Clooney as a leading actor; The Good German is their fifth time at bat as a team, as I count the films.
 Soderbergh seems to veer from big blockbuster, very successful mainstream movies to obscure artistic or political triumphs seen by a small handful of people.  Che, for all its length and the great efforts of Benicio Del Toro in the leading role and the fact that it was released as two movies, took in an absurdly small purse of $1.5 million.
 The Good German is a Soderbergh film that falls fully into the second category.  I hesitate to use loaded terms like masturbatory homage to Casablanca, but its hard not to.  The film is done in classic Film Noir style, in black and white naturally.  Soderbergh even went so far as to use techniques and equipment from the era of the great black and white films of yesteryear.  He used for instance a traditional boom microphone rather than the more modern-and more effective-clip on wireless mikes that are standard today.  The film is a wonder to see.  The play of light and shadow has seldom been done better by any one at any time. The insertion of period news reel clips is seamless and effective.  I haven't seen Joe Stalin looking so well in a very long time.  Filmed on a studio back lot, just like the good old days, the movie truly does have the feel of one of the great old films of the war years.
 The actors in this ensemble effort are uniformly top notch.  George Clooney disappears into his role as a magazine correspondent assigned to cover the Potsdam conclave which followed the defeat of Germany in WWII.  For an actor of Clooneys fame to submerge his self in a role is a huge achievement just for that.  Cate Blanchett continues to improve her already impressive reputation as one of the leading lights of todays cinema.  She has the female lead as an old flame of Clooneys who is now desperate to leave Germany.  Toby Maguire plays an oily black marketer who isn't nearly as clever as he thinks he is.  Also featured is Beau Bridges.  The actors are not in any way to be faulted for the ultimate crash of the film.
 The blame cannot be put to Soderbergh.  The film is flawlessly directed.  It is a film students dream come true.  Every frame is done with meticulous attention to craft and art.
 Even the story cannot be blamed.  As a piece of mystery and intrigue, the film is very good.  The story twists and turns as the correspondent tries to find his way through murder and deceit in order to save the girl.
 The problem is that the characters are so horribly flawed that we don't really care much if they live or die.  The damsel in distress is 1) a murderess 2) complicit in the murder of a number of Jews although she is Jewish herself 3) a whore 4) a manipulative bitch with no sense that other people might have just as much a right to live as she does.  To her credit, she is sorry that she is so horrid.",1412812800,,3308,4.450915141430948

Clooney is the Bogart in this, and while I'm a big fan, and he's not bad at all here, he doesn't have the same noir gravitas as Bogart, which the material seems to call for.

It's tricky to try to combine the entertainment conventions of a love story and mystery with such morally dark material. I don't think it entirely works here, with each undermining the other. The moral complexity of the character played by Blanchett is interesting and compelling to a degree, but the gravity of how it's presented is somewhat at odds with the necessarily manipulative fantasy Hollywood elements.",1407369600,,975,4.975460122699387

Apparently there were not enough black and white films about WWII, so lets make another one. If you noticed they also kept the same bad ""special effect"" of showing a car in motion by moving the scenery around it. George Clooney, a reporter who doesn't write any stories or has any deadlines, returns to Berlin. His driver is Toby MaGuire who plays the bad Spiderman as a driver. He picks Clooney's pocket, works the black market, sells out his country, and just by co-incidence is the unlikeable boyfriend of Clooney's old German girlfriend, who happens to be the wife of a former Nazi. Got all that?

Her husband is dead, but both the Americans and Russians are still looking for him. Toby McGuire offers the ""dead"" German to the Russians for money. Toby turns up dead himself with only a million or so suspects. Now the story goes into a mild who-dun-it which doesn't last too long as Clooney investigates his death which leads to a twisting tale. Toby's killer confesses in an odd first person narration, something unique to this third person tale. This scene was out of place and not necessary as the murder is mentioned in the subsequent conversation. At this point the movie is no longer a who-dun-it, but has another plot twist (not totally unexpected). I suspect the real reason for the film, is the real life underlying political or philosophical aspects which questions committing an evil for the greater good.

In the book the Nazi rocket scientist goes to American with his wife at the end; in the movie he is killed.

2801797,3,B000OY8NBK,"I'll never forgive the Hollywood script writers for mangling a perfectly good story.  Joseph Kanon's book as it was would have made an excellent script. Kanon is an excellent writer (critics compare him with John LeCarre)and his plots are complex but very believeable.  He chooses historical themes, in this case, Germany in the immediate post-war period, when the occupying armies are still getting organized, the black market is roaring, and the first intimations of the Cold War are appearing as America and the Soviet Union each try to capture as many of Germany's top scientists as possible. Emil Brandt is one of these.  His wife Lena was having an affair with an American journalist before the war, and the journalist returns to Berlin to find her, the great love of his life.  What the movie makes of poor Lena is atrocious; but I guess it's Hollywood's view of post-war Berlin, a city of rubble and exhausted, conquered people.  In the book, Lena is something else entirely than the prostitute in the film.  But, the film noir aspects of the movie are done quite well, and the scenes of a bombed-out, ruined Berlin are real, photographed in May 1945 and woven skillfully into the movie.  One problem is that the actors are far too well-fed to be believeable.  Germans in Berlin were literally starving in the months after the surrender. Try though they might, Hollywood makeup artists and cameramen just did not manage to reproduce the look of people who have been  couple years without real meat, butter, eggs, or animal fats in general.

2801799,4,B000OY8NBK,"How do you select a movie for viewing?  Do you have a favorite director?  A favorite actor?  A favorite genre?

Recently a friend recommended the movie CHARLOTTE GRAY, so when I ordered it, I noticed another ""similar"" movie THE GOOD GERMAN. I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett's so this was a no-brainer decision: I ordered both movies. CHARLOTTE was a good movie...with Blanchett in the title role and with the magnificent Michael Gambon and the nice British actor Rupert Penry-Jones...but THE GOOD GERMAN was better! Here's the plot synopsis from the subscription service:

A U.S. Army war correspondent is drawn into a deadly mystery in post-war Berlin as he seeks out his wartime mistress in this adaptation of author Joseph Kanon's best-selling novel. The war is over, and Jake Geismar (George Clooney) is an American journalist assigned the task of covering the peace in Berlin -- but he was once lovers with a mysterious woman named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett). Lena is a lady with many secrets to hide, however, and now that the fighting has ceased, she has every intention of burying her sins and escaping her dark past. As Jake searches for Lena in war-torn Berlin with the assistance of American Army motor pool driver Tully (Tobey Maguire), the complex web of deceit woven by the desperate woman soon leads all three into the black market, which could prove either the ticket to Lena's ultimate escape or the downfall of both her and her pursuers.

What a weak synopsis. Oh, the film starred Clooney, Blanchett, and Maguire.  And the setting and time period is mentioned correctly as post-war Berlin.  But the plot is so much more interesting and multi-layered than hunting for an old wartime lover!  And it's filmed in black and white with all the costume and look of a 1945 old movie. The soundtrack is really awesome with its spikes of impending danger! (I learned later that director Steven Soderbergh...under the pseudonym Peter Andrews...used 1940s era lenses, sound-recording techniques, and a decidedly less-mobile camera for this spectacular effect.)

The story is very thrilling with lots of intrigue. George Clooney is perfectly cast as Jake Geisner, an American journalist in Berlin to cover the Potsdam summit. A young Tobey Maguire, as the Army driver assigned to transport Geisner, stole the first part of the movie playing a very manipulative soldier pimping for certain desperate German women and selling information to the Russians about them. Cate Blanchett is one of those desperate German women: she mysteriously and slightly underplays the part but is brilliant as usual.

And hopefully, you can determine who is the good German?  The question nags me a bit.  I think I know though.

I plan to read Joseph Kanon's 2001 novel of the same name soon. Kanon won a 1988 Edgar for best first mystery for LOS ALAMOS. I may have to go back and read his other books, too: THE PRODIGAL SPY (1998), ALIBI (2005) which won Hammett Prize, and STARDUST (2009).",1314921600,5,2977,4.928
2801800,5,B000OY8NBK,"I give this film a high rating only because of what it could have been.  I know that the actors wanted to make a good post-war film, with the tension and allegory that should have been present. I will tell you how the mark was missed.  I doubt anyone associated with the film watched a single 1945-50 film produced in Germany during the emerging cold war.  Many of these show the compromised characters of post-war Berlin actually IN post-war Berlin.  In this film cuts from real film to computer generated scenes just miss the mark.  In many of those film  you see no one killed or beaten, it is all psychological inner drama and tension.  It is not difficult to find these films.  I have purchased many from Amazon.  Instead, when necessary, this film resorts to Hollywood magic.  The ""sought"" SS-man is able to hide out for weeks--impossible with the military crawling over the ruins of Berlin.  We are asked to believe that a motor-pool corporal can cross military zones with near impunity, stealing cases of scotch and selling them to the other side (the film is set at the time of the Potsdam conference).  There is no justification for ""necessities"" appearing from nowhere (e.g., a French uniform for the SS-man). Although I dislike it, the incessant smoking and drinking is missing.  It can be done without glorifying it (e.g., Slovenka, Slovenian Girl, 2009).  The impoverishment of post-war Berlin is really not apparent.  My point is not that there are better films.  Essentially, my point is that THIS could have been a much better film--and most American moviegoers who would want to see Clooney and Blanchett would NOT know where or when the films were made that provide the background for such a black and white film.  Could have been a masterpiece, but instead, as you see from other reviews and the mean rating, it fell far short.  George, pass auf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1310256000,,1886,4.822429906542056

At its heart there's an intriguing story with a strong moral hook as George Clooney's correspondent for Stars and Stripes finds himself distracted from covering the Potsdam Conference in a devastated Germany by the murder of his black marketeering driver Tobey Maguire, which neither the Russians nor the Americans want investigated. Just to complicate matters, Maguire's girlfriend (who he hired out to lonely GIs) turns out to be not just Clooney's pre-war ex but the wife of the personal secretary to a Nazi rocket scientist and war criminal who both sides are very eager to get their hands on - but not for reasons they might want to get out.

Sadly, it never really gels. Clooney is kept offstage for much of the first twenty minutes, only really entering the plot long after it's set in motion but suddenly forcing it into a dead stop as his backstory has to be explained and his character properly introduced, sidelining the mystery and taking too long to give a reason to care about him. More curiously, despite seeming the most Old Hollywood of modern leading men he doesn't quite look right in a classic setting, a problem shared by Cate Blanchett, who seems to be trying too hard to force Marlene Dietrich and Ingrid Bergman into her character and not managing to pull it off. It's a shame, because there's quite a lot that is good about The Good German, but it's concentrating too self-consciously on the surface trick of looking like an old movie but sounding like a modern one to ever really concentrate on the story and characters, which always seem to be much less of a priority. As a result, despite a good twist ending, by the time we get to the all-too-obviously Casablanca-inspired airport finale, we simply don't care whether Clooney and Dietrich get on the plane together or part.

She's a good actor, but this movie is just wrong for her - as wrong as her accent.  George Clooney, who is an actor I usually enjoy watching, was very clunky and awkward in this role.  I don't really blame the actors here.  I think the director is at fault.  He wanted an incredibly stylized performance and movie, and he got it, to the detriment of acting, cinematography and plot.  And where did they dig up the ""Russian"" actors?  The ""Russian"" they were speaking was bad enough I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  The ending is really bad.

I gave the movie two stars because I think if even a few people are inspired to find out more about Operation Paperclip, the OSS program to bring Nazi scientists to the US, then the various aesthetic sins of the film can be offset in some way.

I'm not sure exactly where he went wrong but I failed to care about any of the principles.  And when you can't engage the interest of the audience enough to drag them through all of the meananderings of the grim and grisly plot, then why bother?

The ""hero"" whose name I've already forgotten although I just watched this, played by George Clooney, never managed to engage me.  I think a different actor might have made the film work.  Clooney is handsome and can be very charming in an old-fashioned, Cary Grant way. (Maybe Soderburgh should make something in the style of the wonderful, slick and glamorous Grant films, casting Clooney....that might be a hoot.) He has no ability to convey any emotion facially and after while, who cares?  He is supposed to be so enamored of this woman that he risks life and limb over and over but somehow he never manages to show us that.

Cate Blanchett is very beautiful here and her extraordinary cheek bones play wonderfully in the intense black and white lighting. She is a fine actress and although I was tempted at times to make cheap remarks about her attempting to imitate Marlene Dietrich, I do think that she did the best anyone could with this silly plot.  She manages to look stunning all the time which is quite a feat for someone who has been on the brink of starvation for years.

I haven't read the book this was taken from so I don't know exactly what went wrong in re-writing the script.  But it failed to show just what motivated the Clooney character to keep after Lena (Blanchett).  He got beat up time after time and his driver, (Toby Maguire) was killed because of his involvement with her...She was mysterious and elusive--perhaps he was just a man who needed punishment, but the story makes us believe he is the virtuous hero, not just a jerk.

Well, after sitting through all of this, I really didn't care who got on the plane at the end and who didn't.  When a film that tries so hard leaves viewers (I'm not the only one) not caring, there's something very wrong.

It looks good, though.",1261267200,,2539,4.518599562363239

The incredibly bad editing of what is primarily an artsy film results in a fractured and barely comprehensible story-line. The sophomoric moralizing and slightly veiled anti-American message (we wanted to obtain German rocket technology regardless of the immorality of the German scientists who embodied it) further detracts from this particular piece of vanity.  Every aspect of the movie pails in comparison to the Third Man and Casablanca.  Unforgivably it totally lacks suspense - though the genre and the story cry out for it.  In fact, the only thing that the movie has going for it - the powerful depiction of the utter physical and social destruction of Berlin  - and that might make it interesting as part of a HS History or German class is wrecked by one gratuitous sex scene.

Instead of everybody being good and noble, we have the American
behaving at times like Nazis in this film.
This story is about a 1946 Berlin where the people are living in the ruins
and the GI's are kings.
The jeep driver thinks he has hit real pay dirt
when it turns out his German girl friend -prostitute
is married to someone both the Russians and Americans want.
But the newspaper reporter he is driving also remembers her
from before the war. Lena is a case of survival at any cost
and pretty much hates herself worse than anyone else could,
yet men makes fools of themselves over her.
The acting is pretty good and the movie almost convinces you
that this was the 40's again.
Even the end is the same as Casablanca with an airplane leaving,
but what is between sort makes you wonder who really won that war?",1252800000,,1001,5.147239263803681

What a stupid ploy to cater to the degenerate tastes of filmgoers. Try watching ""Casablanca,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" ""King Kong"" or any film made in the 1930's, 1940's or 1950's to see how black-and-white movies were made and what they're about. Very good plots...and NO sex, nudity, language or graphic violence.

Ultimately, what's, well... good about ""The Good German"" is that it doesn't settle for being a well-produced pastiche of old wartime movies, but says a few compelling things about the ways otherwise decent people are willing to behave in situations when they feel their backs are against the wall.

Japan has not been bombed yet and a army journalist(Clooney) arrives in Berlin for, in my understanding, a conference. He is not a stranger to Berlin. He lived there before the war and was in some sort of relationship with Cate Blanchett's character. Upon arrival, he is issued a driver, played to the point of annoyance by Tobey Maguire. Surprise suprise, Tobey's character is now involved with Cate's character and then we find out that Cate's husband, who everyone, including her assumes died in the war-but maybe not? Yea... it can get a tad confusing.

This murder mystery does not have a good handle of things from the onset. There are many problems with this film, most deriving from the script and characters. Tobey Maguire sticks out like a sore thumb in this-just badly miscast any way you look at it. George Clooney plays the same character in every film-no surprise. Cate B. is extraodinary as usual, so versatile you would never believe she WASN'T German. But even she can't save this convoluted mess of a film.

There is murder, and mystery and a boring romantic subplot that goes nowhere, and characters you can't even begin to care for for various reasons. I can see why this bombed in theaters. The one thing this film has going for it, is its authentic look. Shot entirely in black and white, it comes so very close to the old films we all know that it's just a shame the actual plot can't be any better.

I'm always amazed by the five star reviews of certain films. I know everyone has a right to their opinion, but if you rank this 5 stars, what are you comparing this to?

He was a skilled journeyman director who knew how to tell a good story well.  Yet as Soderbergh is self-consciously trying to recreate something that came naturally, he took any real feeling out of it.  Beyond the absense of real feeling, the high contrast visual style was so distracting that I could never get into the story.  Curtiz movies never looked like that!

He's up there with the likes of David Lynch and Cronenberg and various other experimentalists or avant-garde-ists.  ""The Good German"" is beyond simply being a film noir, or having A-List actors in it (which he always does)- the film is to produce an effect and evoke something more than your average or even above average film can accomplish.

when you deal with a director with this much vision and true artistry, viewers are bound to be polarized (even the ""thinking"" ones).  None of his films do particularly well at the box office and are usually very limited run and more often than not they will be sitting on your local Blockbuster's shelf waiting to be rented by YOU.

Solaris:  based on a book AND a prior Russian film.  lots of people ""didn't get it"", others hated it because they felt it was a bad 'adaptation'... simply, it's sodergergh's way of doing it.

""The good German"" is a splendid and potent Noir film that focuses exactly the day before the Potsdam conference.

An American General (Clooney) is sent to Germany in 1945 after having performing as journalist in 1939 when he met Lena Brandt  (Cate Blanchet), the femme fatale, whom eventually will have a torrid love affair despite of the fat she is still married with an important assistant of a key scientist who is developing a raising project by then, the V2. When an unexplainable homicide occurs, the thread will lead us to the hidden and sinister reasons backstage.

Filmed in astonishing black and white, we feel the imperious necessity of Soderbergh to pay a homage not only the Noir genre, but besides the German Expressionism, the unforgettable film ""The Third man"" under the streets of Berlin  and specially Casablanca (the last sequence is more than a simple referential)

It's useless to say the principal star of the film is Cate Blanchet (one of the ten top actress all over the world) who really steals the show and looks light years around all the cast. She is the central nerve of the film from start to finish. Her German accent and her astonishing corporal gestures and the fabulous shots make of this film a winner but with just two inexcusable stains.

The choice of Beau Bridges as the Colonel is totally unconvincing. He doesn't demonstrate the perverse energy the role demands, looking absolutely uncomfortable along the film.

There's just an unforgiving flaw along the film. Pay special attention between the minute 30: 11 and 30:25 when we have the discussion between the General and the Colonel. When the discussion is over Clooney leaves the room and so we may observe the chair in which Clooney was sat, but when he is required and advised by the Colonel, the camera shows us the incredible: the chair simply has missed; an unforgiving mistake, keeping in mind the number of so many editors director assistant.

Who should Jake run into but Lena (Blanchette), his former lover? And Lena now just happens to be involved with Tully. Sound like too much of a coincidence? You bet it is. When Tully turns up dead, Geismer spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out whodunit and why.

Shot in black and white, in the film noir style, the cinematography is a beauty to behold. Rich, dark shadows with angles of light. Blanchette's hair, black for the film, stands out in sharp relief against her pale coloring. Costumes are gorgeous and almost worth killing for. Even the cigarette smoke cooperates, wafting eerily through the scenes.

Unlike some previous reviewers, I thought the performances were unbelievable. Blanchette is a chameleon. I fully believe this woman can be ANYONE.

He was certainly a slow learner! Especially since he had lived in Berlin before and was no greenhorn.

The SS and their wives were vetted so thoroughly at the time for their Aryan backgrounds that I found it a bit of a stretch that the Cate Blanchett character, married to an SS officer, was actually Jewish.  But stranger things happened during the war; of itself it was not totally implausible. The plot however seemed a bit unclear and the action repetitive. Also, none of the characters were particularly likeable. True to life, perhaps, but it muddies the lens.

I am not a fan of George Clooney and his performance here left a lot to be desired. The movie raises a lot of questions of the morality of war and those who are involved in it from whatever perspective. It gives the lie to the black and white sides of a wartime experience and allows the viewer to examine the multitudeinous shades of grey.

Survival of the fittest is also a central concern and highlights some of the difficulties arriving at an ethical judgemt whenever our own survival is threatened. The backdrop to this whole story is the dirty business of politics and the dividing of the spoils as exemplified by the biblical story of the roman soldiers dividing up Jesus' gaments after his crucifixion.

The big bubbles are the name actors and homage to film noir. The overweaning style, heightened by the best component of the film (Thomas Newman's music) is intriguing to lovers of the genre, but the actors, professional as they are, can't bring much to their roles, probably as a result of the direction. Clooney is likeable as always but doesn't project the necessary intensity of caring for Cate Blanchett that the action demands. Blanchett does create a character, but it's too Dietrich-like to stand in its own right. So, after the plot ends and the actors leave the screen, you're left with disappointment, even though your hopes were up and you were saying to yourself, ""This film isn't as bad as they were claiming!""

The bottom line for me is: the real comparison film is Lars Von Trier's ""Zentropa"" (or ""Europa"") of 1991. That film has 10 times more noir techniques of interest, and a stronger symbolic element that makes the necessity of characterization less important.

I think it is a valid question with the scene setup at the airport at the end why did he choose to copy ""Casablanca,"" without adding anything significantly to that setup.  We do get the profound twist [spoiler] that Lena survived by turning in other Jews to the Gestapo, but it only serves to take what we think is going to be a romantic ending and shatters it.  Perhaps like the Wizard of Oz, the film should suddenly have burst into color as the lights come on in Clooney's head.

Thomas Newman's score was nominated for the Oscar from this film and is one of the best elements of the picture.

George Clooney won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Syriana"" in 2005.  He's an actor who brings depth to even a thin character.  As Captain Jake Geismer, he broods and carries a torch romantically for Lena, even as he gets beaten up by Toby MacGuire.  While Clooney does a good job IMHO, the plot seems to beat him back consistently, ""You should have never come back to Berlin.""  We might have had a more interesting film if he'd been elsewhere.

Cate Blanchett filmed ""Notes On a Scandal"" & ""Babel"" this same year.  She does a journeyman's job.  She's got a distinctive, lovely face and turns in an expressive low-key performance that smolders from the pressures of trying to survive.  While she won her Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""The Aviator"" in 2004, she did not add to her honors with this film.

Toby MacGuire's got boy-next-door looks.  The plot undercuts his appeal by showing his character Tully boffing Blanchett from behind bent over the bed.  Then he clubs Clooney into a clump and jumps into the Jeep for a getaway.  MacGuire's only acting recognition at this point is a Best Supporting Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics Association for ""The Wonder Boys"" in 2000.  Unfortunately, his best Good German moment was as a corpse pulled from the river with debris clinging to his face.

Shown to best advantage is Christian Oliver as Emile Brandt.  Oliver has not worked extensively with credits like ""The Baby Sitters Club"" in 1995 and ""Subject Two"" about vampires in 2005.  But as Lena's husband hidden away, he brings depth and good looks in his brief camera appearances.

Who knows why Beau Bridges signed on to play Col. Muller in this film.  The best thing about his performance is that he showed up for work and shot the scenes.

This is neither a wonderful film nor an awful film.  It's an average film.  I'd watch it just to see Cate Blanchett.  With lowered expectations, it's good for an evening's viewing.  Enjoy!",1198022400,5,2923,4.666666666666667

The theme of this film as  with the majority of todays Hollywood movies is a message of anti-US sentiment.

2801883,2,B000OY8NBK,"This movie was filmed in throwback black-and-white, which I usually like. But here the attempt to recreate the look of old newsreel footage just comes across as self-conscious artsy effect. This whole movie is unfortunately too much about projecting a look, and too little about telling a coherent, engaging story.

""The Good German"" was presumably meant to be a serious drama about post-WWII Europe, when the Nuremberg Tribunal was being convened and researchers were trying to identify people guilty of war crimes so that they could be prosecuted. In that climate of shifting, concealed identities, black-market wheeling-and-dealing, and wild speculation - there was enough intrigue to fill thousands of compelling stories. But this doesn't turn out to be one of them.

This is too garbled and contrived a view of those years. It's an uneasy mix of ""The Third Man"" and ""Casablanca.""  One of the scenes is in fact such a replica rip-off of a famous Casablanca scene that it makes this whole movie seem like parody.

George Clooney, who stars in as well as directs, makes it hard for us to take the movie seriously in other ways. For one thing, he is brutally beaten a number of times, but never seems to suffer any damage beyond the need for a band-aid. And even that can be quickly peeled off, showing him none the worse for wear. It's like the 1950's TV westerns in which the singing cowboy heroes would get into repeated fierce somersaulting fights - without ever so much as losing their white hats.

2801885,2,B000OY8NBK,"I know director Steven Soderbergh likes experimental films, but I never imagined he would do this. In ""The Good German"" you will see a film noir starring George Clooney, Cate Blanchett and Tobey Mcguire in a complicated story of crimes and intrigues set in the ruined city of post-war Berlin in 1945, divided into sectors by the Allies, just like Vienna in ""The Third Man."" ""The Good German"" is shot exactly the same way as old films of 1940s - editing, camera angles, lighting, plus even title backs and acting style. So Thomas Newman's score, which deservedly nominated for Oscar, is just impressive in more than one way.

Yes, the results impressed me pretty much at first, and soon bored me because of the lack of emotions. All actors look fine in the meticulously re-created images of old Hollywood films, especially cast-against-type Clooney as military journalist who stumbles upon murder mystery and ever-fantastic Blanchett as mysterious lady with a Dietrich-like accent. The film sometimes uses strongly sexual and violent actions and languages as if trying to remind us that this is not just a copy of old film.

But the film's real problem lies behind the styles. When the film attempts to be thrilling or romantic with the convoluted plot, it becomes painfully clear that there is nothing truly interesting here. The film keeps unraveling layers of mysteries without stirring any emotions within us. You don't see the chemistry of Bogart and Bergman, without which the story fails to be engaging.

I don't know anything about the source novel. I only imagine that it is much better than this adaptation, which borrows one scene from ""Casablanca"" while it does not need to do so. The scene may be a pastiche; or it may be that Soderbergh meant it for real. Whichever it is, I still don't see the point of shooting an entire feature film in this way while it is devoid of any suspense or romance.",1192320000,4,1907,4.825688073394495

Clooney's character gets beat up by: Americans, Germans and Russians and we get confused as to why is he in Berlin after all since there are barely any sparks coming form his former pre-war German girl flame played by Blachett.  This is no Casablanca by any means, and definitely not a love story.  The film did get me thinking of what is it that people are capable of doing for the sake of self preservation and survival?  And how much the institution of marriage is about loyalty to one another?

2801897,2,B000OY8NBK,"Steven Soderbergh loves to pay homage. In fact, (Mr. Tarantino aside),he probably holds the record for dropping more cinema buff-centric references per film than any other director. In his most recent film, ""The Good German"" (filmed in B&W), he may have allowed this tendency lead him too deeply into ""style over substance"" territory.

The story is set in immediate post-war Berlin, with the backdrop of the uneasy alliance and growing mistrust between the occupying U.S. and Russian military forces. Captain Jacob Geismer (George Clooney) is an American military correspondent who has been assigned to cover the Potsdam Conference. His G.I. driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire) is a slick wheeler-dealer (reminiscent of James Garner's character in ""The Americanization of Emily"") who ""procures"" everything from sundries to women and has a German girlfriend named Lena Brandt (a barely recognizable Cate Blanchett, dutifully delivering all her lines in a husky Marlene Dietrich drone). Imagine Capt. Geismer's surprise when Tully introduces him to said girlfriend, and she happens to be an old lover of his.

To say much more about the narrative would risk revealing spoilers, so suffice it to say that Lena, a Woman with a Dark Secret, soon becomes the central figure in a murder mystery, with the hapless Geismer drawn into the thick of it.

Unfortunately, despite a certain amount of suspense in the first act,the story becomes increasingly convoluted and curiously uninvolving. Blanchett's performance feels a bit phoned-in, and I wouldn't call it Clooney's best work either. Now, it is possible that Soderbergh is SO obsessed with aping the feel of a film noir-ish, black and white late-40's war thriller, that he may have directed his actors to mimic the semi-wooden, melodramatic acting style that informed many of those films. (Even the DVD transfer appears to be in tune with the affectation; as it is matted in full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio).

The cinematography is a bit overexposed and  ""washed out"", although I can see that Soderbergh is making an admirable attempt to mimic the chiaroscuro look of a certain classic Carol Reed film (I am sure I am not the first person to draw comparisons to ""The Third Man"").There are also some other obvious touchstones here, like Hitchcock's WW2 thrillers ""Notorious (DVD)"" and (especially) ""Foreign Correspondent"".

At the end of the day, however, if I really want to see something that reminds me of ""The Third Man"" or ""Foreign Correspondent"",I think if I had my druthers, I would just as soon pull out my copy of....er, ""The Third Man"" or ""Foreign Correspondent"", if you know what I am saying.

2801899,4,B000OY8NBK,"Recently, I have seen two films which have left audiences either being bored witless, or entranced, enjoying something different and intrigued by the plot. The Good Shepherd was a slow moving espionage drama, that dealt with lies,spies, and stealth,and The Good German is about survival,
lies, entrapment,desperation.
The Stephen Soderburgh directed ""Good German"" is a dark film both in dialogue and style - very reminscent of The Third Man, and the great Warner Bros film noirs of the 40's/50's.
Apparently he reverted back to using the same kind of cameras that were used in the forties,had the lighting changed to ensure the darkened look of the film replicated the look of the film noire - which built up the sense of danger and fear so essential to the background of a war torn Berlin.
The central female character, Lena Brandt (played with perfection by Cate Blanchet) is a woman who is widowed,was raped by the Russians,now working as a prostitute,who is desperate to get out of Berlin, but needs a man to protect her and pay her way out.
She becomes the mistress of Tully, a rather nasty,oportunistic and violent fellow who's ""day job"" is as an American Army motor pool driver. This is the first time I've seem Maguire playing a cad, but he inserts just the right amount of the ""smilimg assassin"" into his character.
I recall one chilling moment when he is driving Jake - an American journalist (George Clooney) in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference.
Sully is bragging like a big shot about his his girlfriend, then he stops and says ""You can have her for an hour if you like.""  That summed Tully's character up in one sentence, she was using him to get out of the country and he was using her for whatever took his fancy, knowing as he did that Lena was dependant on him for freedom and food,her very survival.
George Clooney's Jake (reminiscent of William Holden at his peak in this) is a former lover of Lena's and when Sully is murdered after crossing the border into the Russian Zone,he steps in to try and help her.
Lena proves to be not what she pretends to be - her survival instincts are such that during the war she cold bloodedly betrayed neighbours to the Gestapo - an act that comes back to haunt her.
She is shown as self absorbed and ruthless, using men for their power as she is powerless, prepared to do whatever is necessary to save herself.
All in all, it's a tale of shadows and intrigue,of people who have lost their souls and who are trying to come to terms with all that has happened to them.
The Good German is not a five star journey, but thanks largely to Blanchet's fine acting and Soderburgh's direction, the film is worth of 4.",1187481600,11,2668,4.59329140461216
2801900,4,B000OY8NBK,"""Different. Good but not great.""  That pretty much sums it up.  I am not a film noir expert.  My movie experiences of the past mostly stem from Alfred Hitchcock movies.  And have only seen Casablanca once, a long time ago.  Actually, it doesn't really matter, I think some of the elements of the past were captured pretty well, it was the plot (or maybe the book to movie translation) and script that really didn't work.  The lighting was well done, the shadows, the music to set the tone.  All of that was done pretty well.  There were some good support roles also.  I even kind of like Tobey's appearance.  The things for me that didn't work were the simplistic dialogue, the kind of strange background plot, and there were no real climatic moments.  After a while, you don't really care what happens, you just kind of want stuff to be wrapped up.  And then when it is wrapped up, you still don't care.

And on another note, normally we think of the heroine character as someone we empathize with.  Our heroine seemed a little dirty for me.  She seemed to be popular in the towns that she visited (if you know what I mean), also I couldn't let go the Nazi angle.  These aren't some of the best deeds for the lead characters.

2801901,3,B000OY8NBK,"Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is not to be dismissed, but I am disappointed with how misbegotten this stylized 2006 melodrama is given the potential of the material and the pedigree of the cast. The idea is intriguing enough - recreate a WWII-era, black-and-white Warner Brothers movie replete with back projection shots, a period-authentic score (composed with appropriately grand orchestration by Thomas Newman), and plot elements borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B00009W0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man/dp/B000NOK0GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man</a>. What Soderbergh does is apply current sensibilities about the characters that would have been heavily censored by the Hayes Office at the time. The result just doesn't resonate, and the chief culprit seems to be Paul Attanasio's dull, often incoherent screenplay. He eschews the romanticism necessary to make Soderbergh's ruse work, and the characters' motivations come across with little conviction, at least anything that would make sense to a discerning viewer.

The convoluted story follows war correspondent Jake Geismar back to Berlin where he ran the AP bureau before the war began. He finds a city in ruins not only in terms of the buildings but in the people who remained for the war's duration. Geismar is covering the Potsdam Conference for the New Republic, but he also wants to find his former lover, Lena Brandt. Assigned to drive him around the city is an American soldier named Tully, whose chipper exterior masks an angry, amoral center deep into the local black market. The fates of these characters clash unexpectedly around Lena's mathematician husband, whom she claims is dead, even though he is still pursued by a number of unsavory characters including a corrupt U.S. Congressman. As Geismar, George Clooney is smart enough not to mimic Bogie, but he also doesn't slip into his role very easily since his ironic lan is at odds with the character's obsessive, misguided nature.

You would think the superbly talented Cate Blanchett would have a field day playing a Dietrich-like femme fatale, especially with her convincing Teutonic accent and camera-ready cheekbones, but Lena is presented so cryptically that we become indifferent to her tenuous situation. Soderbergh also spends precious little time developing the romantic aspect of their relationship, which should have been the driving force to their often irrational actions. Tobey McGuire's boyish demeanor as Tully becomes unctuous almost immediately, and the role's darker dimensions escape his grasp. The production's technical aspects provide curiosity value, although the result can be less than enthralling, for example, Soderbergh's camerawork is far too crisp to compare reasonably with the gauzy treatments of old studio craftsmen like Arthur Edeson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B00009W0WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>) or Robert Krasker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man/dp/B000NOK0GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man</a>).

""The Good German"" is director Steven Soderbergh's homage to the Film Noir genre.

All the usual Noir elements are there - a convoluted plot, a femme fatale, romance, mystery, and a hero who is continually being beaten up.

There are strong echoes of Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" in the post WWII setting (in this case Berlin) and also Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" in the relationship between Blanchett and Clooney's characters.

Soderbergh employs a number of devices to evoke the Noir look of the film: firstly it is shot in black and white, secondly there are ""wipes"" between scenes, thirdly an over-ripe musical score by Thomas Newman typical of the period, fourthly it (deliberately) looks like it was shot in a studio replete with obvious rear-screen projection when characters are driving around.

Overall the film works quite well. The acting is excellent especially Blanchett at the tortured Lena Brandt. Only Tobey Maguire as a brutal, scheming Army driver fails to convince.

2801904,3,B000OY8NBK,"This movie had some positive features, but for me the negatives interfered with my overall enjoyment.

Positive: Cate Blanchett was wonderful. She could read the Tel Aviv phone book and bring tears to your eyes. Unfortunately, at times the Tel Aviv phone book might have provided her with better dialog than did the script for this movie. Positive: The black and white photography superbly captures the look and feel of a 1940's noir drama, with nods to Casablanca and The Third Man. Overall, the cinematography was probably the single most impressive ""character"" in the whole production.

Now for the negatives: The casting was silly. Toby Maguire was selected to play the womanizing, butt-kicking, black market racketeer-tough guy. That's right folks, Toby Maguire. Give me a break....were they simply looking for a recognizable actor, without regard for the fact he was completely unsuited for and never (for a second) believable in this role? Then to make matters worse, they cast George Cloony as the wimpy ""good guy"" who gets his butt kicked in virtually every scene...including once by Toby!!! They must have had George standing in a hole and Toby on a crate for that one. It was unconvincing to the point of being laughable. I can see George as a good guy....but never a wimp.

Another negative for me was the agonizingly slow pace of the story. You could take a short nap and not miss a lot. In fact, I think parts of this movie might be a suitable substitute for Ambien.

In conclusion: Watch it (if you must) for the wonderful cinematography, but be prepared for the preposterous casting and the lethargic pace. It has the look of a great movie....without the substance.",1185408000,4,1681,4.887719298245614

The careful planning to make everything seem so precise as it would've been sixty years ago is a nice idea, but it shouldn't involve the actors, who performed as robotically as if they too were a part of the facade. I am a fan of all of the actors involved but their performances were poor. Maguire was a cartoon thug, Clooney was wooden and dull, and Blanchett was morose and vague.
Another issue I had with the film is that they added in some 21st century gratuity to the film in sex scenes, nudity, and dozens of f-bombs from Spider-Man and it seemed really out of place. I am not prudish in any way, but the jarring inappropriateness of it in this context was off-putting. There was simply no need for it outside of titillation. That works great in a Will Ferrel movie, but not here.
I can't even say that this is worth it to rent unless you wait until it moves from the more expensive new releases to the cheaper stock, or wait until it puts you to sleep on tv.

He learns that his driver, a good-old boy from America (Tobey McGuire), is sleeping with the girl he fell in love with, Lena (Cate Blanchett). Lena was married to an important man affiliated with the Nazis, and although everyone knows he is dead, the government is looking for him. Geismer knows that there is more to the story than he is being told, so he begins to look into things on his own time, which puts him in harm's way.

The mystery is too political. Audiences either need some prior knowledge of the trials in Germany or interest in politics to follow the twists and turns that the film takes.

Director Steven Soderbergh tried admirably to recreate the classic film noir feel for this movie. His use of wipe transitions, jarring camera angles, stark black and white, fast close ups, voice overs, newsreels, cigarette smoking, and expressive background music all revive the era nicely, but the film still screams modern Hollywood. Perhaps it is the language, the sex, or the more graphic violence. It could have benefitted from faster editing as well.

The characters are interesting enough, although the men do not fit the bill for noir heroes. McGuire is too sweet despite trying hard to appear tough. Clooney somehow doesn't gel either, though his controlled demeanor is consistent. The only appropriate casting choice was in Blanchett whose femme fatal is a mix of Marlene Dietrich in A Foreign Affair and Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice.",1184544000,6,1591,4.907063197026022

2801908,3,B000OY8NBK,"There's times where I don't really care for Steven Soderbergh movies. Traffic I felt was a compelling if overlong drama that had an aura of self-importance, like it was intentionally made to be one of those ""important"" films. The Good German sometimes feels like the same way: like it wants to be a classic noir film although the intent of course was for it to feel like a film that would've been made at RKO in the old days. While there's some things that feel out of place and just a genuine feeling of sluggishness, it's still a good homage to a classic time period.

Jake Geismser (George Clooney) is in Berlin covering the Potsdam Conference with Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and President Roosevelt. He meets driver Tully (Tobey Maguire) who's a nice guy until he's left alone in where he becomes a scheming, violent firebrand. His girlfriend is prostitute Lena (Cate Blanchett) who of course has to be Geismer's ex. But the name ""Emil Brandt"" pops up which gets everyone riled up and a murder happens which gets Jake investigating on who the culprit is and what's so important about Emil Brandt.

I will say this: this film has the perfect 1940's feel, from the shadows to the staging, the overdramatic music and it's even presented in full-frame. Even if you don't like the movie, you got to admit they nailed the feel. As far as acting, we do have Clooney and Blanchett who almost were born to be in black and white with Blanchett looking the best. Only misstep was Maguire since he's not really menacing so much as he goes into temper tantrums. If he did this performance in Spider-Man 3, that movie would've benefited. He even rabbit punches a girl in this just so the filmmakers can let you know this guy's tough. Classically trained actors just needed to look at you to know he's not one to cross; Maguire has to actually be given something violent to do.

The problem with the movie as a whole is that it's just...kind of boring. It's as if more attention was paid to the look than the script. Casablanca was talky sure but at least it kept your interest. This feels like you're just checking the time code a lot wondering how long the movie's been on. But if you're one that prefers the old movies, you'll probably like this although a sex scene that would've got cut feels odd while there's tons of language to get thrown around. But, as far as a great B&W movie is concerned, Good Night and Good Luck is definately a better pick.

Either it's to preserve the ""magic"" of making the movie or just simply make special features unavailable until a bigger Special Edition is announced, it's really bare-bones.

2801909,4,B000OY8NBK,"I really think that Cate Blanchett's performance here is as good as anything I've seen lately. She is incredibly impressive as Lena and her passion for the role has a powerful effect on our enjoyment of The Good German. As for Clooney, he is believable as Jake Geismer and makes a solid contribution. The only important actor here I cannot be as positive about; although, perhaps I'm the only person who remains completely unimpressed by Tobey Maguire. I was surprised by how discordant his efforts were. He reminded me of that phrase that acting is not ""acting"" as he was ""acting"" or seemed to be intentionally playing a character. I felt that his Tully was contrived and quite bizarre. He stood out like spoiled sauerkraut among this ensemble, and detracted from the movie's worth. The plot itself was riveting and it kept you focused in every scene as if it were a classic piece of 40s noir, but, at its root, the storyline was rather fantastic. The US occupation government in Germany was a little too clueless to be as sinister as they are depicted here. My willingness to suspend belief was strained, but I still found The Good German to be entertaining.",1182556800,7,1160,4.719211822660099
2801910,1,B000OY8NBK,"...or was this badly re-invented tripe the best that Soderbergh could do with Kanon's novel?  Lena, the female lead of book/film - rape victim and NOT a prostitute - is converted from a war weary, emotionally vulnerable yet stable and admirable lead into a vague, emotionally dull, unstable Gestapo informant by way of Marlene Dietrich impersonator.  Tully, the character about whom little is known yet all action centers around, is turned into a noir caricature, who is entirely unsympathetic and loathsome.  Jake, the central character and lead, is (in the novel) always a step and thought ahead of the other characters and of the action; in the novel, he seems to be the last person in the know.

Noir as a genre can and should be explored in modern cinema, but all this film seems to show is how bad parody and caricature can make even the most incidental wartime story appear.  Cinematography aside (which was the only thing commented on favorably by the majority of critics), this was the second worst Soderbergh film I've sat through.  It may be time for SS to temporarily, or perhaps permanently, disassociate himself from Clooney.",1182124800,18,1139,4.90625
2801911,3,B000OY8NBK,"It was a bit of a shock at first to see Batman (George Clonney) and Spider Man (Tobey McQuire) together in the opening scenes of THE GOOD GERMAN. Especially seeing Spider Man. But that went away quickly with Maquire's tough, black-marketing Corporal Tully erasing memories of his sweet Spidey role. Despite the action-hero star presence of Clooney and Maguire, Cate Blanchette turns out to be the real star of this blank and white post WW II noir film, her sultry, dangerously mysterious persona stealing the show. The camera seems to linger on her like a love sick teenager. The plot is about Americans and Russians trying to locate a German scientist and people getting killed or betrayed. But I found myself drifting away from the details of the plot twists and focusing instead on the atmospherics of post-war Berlin with rubble still in the streets and women selling themselves to survive. That and the characters portrayed by Blanchett and Clooney, who this time out finds himself in a subdued role without a script to emphasise his gift of humor or his glamour. In fact, in the harsh black and white photography, Clooney looks older and haggard while Blanchett becomes even more beautiful. The GOOD GERMAN takes its time and goes mostly nowhere but you will enjoy being there with Cate. Director Steven Soderbergh is intent on giving us a moody film with lots of shadows and dramatic lighting and cinematic posturing to classic black and white movies like CASABLANCA. In THE GOOD GERMAN you can see similarities to SOLARIS, another film directed by Soderbergh. Both are fine, quiet, psychological studies with more mood than action.",1181779200,6,1639,4.963636363636364
2801912,4,B000OY8NBK,"Steven Soderbergh's ""The Good German"", depending on your age and knowledge of film can either be seen as a daring, new experimental film shot in black & white or a tribute to classic war time Hollywood films of the 1940s, most noteably ""Casablanca"". I belong to the latter.

 Capt. Jack Geismer (George Clooney) is an American journalist, who use to live in Berlin before the war. After the war he was giving a choice of being stationed either in London or Berlin. According to Geisman there was no choice. He knew he wanted to go back to Berlin to try and find his lost love Lena (Cate Blanchett) who may or may not have been involved with the Nazis.

 Intrigue soon follows as Geisman's driver, Tully (Tobey Maguire) is found dead. He allegedly had information regarding a German scientist Emil Brandt. In order to thicken the plot a bit we find out Emil was married to Lena, and it was her really the killers were looking for. Tully was having an affair with Lena and promised to get her out of Berlin. This all takes place before Geisman finds out about Tully and Lena and wants to rekindle their faded flame.

 To say more about the plot would be a mistake. I'd ruin the entire film for you. But I have to admit I think the visuals and the effect Soderbergh was going for is a bit more interesting to talk about then the plot itself. The movie was shot on actually camera equipment used in during the 40s. The film has such a crisp look to it, that if it were not for the strong language and graphic sexual content, this could have been one of the lost films of 1946 suddenly found. Soderbergh did his homework on this one. I'm not much of a fan of his work. I didn't enjoy titles such as ""Full Frontal"", ""Kafka"" or his ""Ocean"" movies (I haven't seen 13 yet) but I did like ""Traffic"" (which I think deserved the best picture Oscar over ""Gladiator"") and ""Erin Brockovich"". Here though Soderbergh must be given his due credit. The film is more than an imitation. It is compelling enough where it could stand on its own without the gimmick of the camera equipment.

 But not just the look of the film captures the spirit of the times we have to give credit to Clooney and Blachett. I was never much of a Clooney fan but when I say ""Good Night and Good Luck"" I found a new respect for him and he is quite good in this film. He definitely recalls Bogart, though the part is a little different. Bogart was usually an outsider who didn't want to get involved. Remember his line in ""Casablanca""? ""I stick my neck out for no man."" Here Clooney's character wants to get involved. It was the whole point of his journey.

 Blanchett on the other hand I've always admired. She is one of the great actresses working today. If we want to compare this to ""Casablanca"" we could say she brings Ingrid Bergman to mind but for some reason I thought of Greta Garbo. That mysterious woman appeal that Garbo excelled at seems to be what Blanchett was going for.

 A lot of people didn't seem to like this film. I came across mostly negative reviews from the critics and the public didn't seem to embrace it either. Why do I like it? I have no clue. I could just be the simple reason I like what Soderbergh was going for. I enjoy Hollywood films from the time period. Or it could be it was just a good movie. Maybe a combination of both. Either way ""The Good German"" is worth watching.

Bottom-line: Steven Soderbergh's tribute to classic Hollywood films of the 1940s does a great job of recreating the look and feel of the films from the era but the story is good enough to work on its own.",1181692800,2,3572,4.36144578313253

2801914,4,B000OY8NBK,"I don't understand the reactions many people---audiences and critics alike---had to this movie. It was made in black and white and set during the war, so therefore it either had to be as good as ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man,"" or it was a piece of junk. I don't follow this logic at all. Was every film-noir movie made in 1945 a five-star masterpiece? I don't think so.

This is a really good movie! In fact I'd put it up there with the director's best work. And not just in terms of craft, which is first-rate, but in terms of the whole package. The acting is excellent, the dialogue crisp and perfect, the pace and structure of the film, everything.

The point is, they tried to do it in this movie like they'd have done it back then, and they did a wonderful job. This movie is a great piece of cinematic storytelling, if it had been released in 1945 it would have been a hit and we'd remember it as a great or near-great film. We wouldn't tear it apart by the seams like people do today. Long story short, see this movie not because it resembles the film noirs of Ye Olde Hollywoode....see it because IT'S A GOOD MOVIE.

My only problem with it is, no extras? Was Soderbergh so incensed by the hostile critical reception to the movie that he refused to put together a commentary and a documentary detailing the making of the movie? Speaking as a fan, I'd like to see what he (and the cast and crew) has to say.",1181692800,2,1415,4.31203007518797
2801915,4,B000OY8NBK,"SPOILER ALERT!!!

If you haven't already seen the film, The Good German, then don't read any further or some of the surprises that pop up in the movie will be ruined for you.

First, let me admit that the only reason I bought this DVD was because I hoped to see the ethereal Cate Blanchett either putting on a pair of nylons, or taking them off.  After all, this is a movie that takes place in post-war Germany in 1945, and it is rated ""R.""  Unfortunately, there were no stocking shots of Ms. Blanchett in the film, which was a huge disappointment to me, but I still enjoyed it to a large degree.  It did take me most of the movie to finally realize why it was ""R"" rated and not ""PG-13.""  If the F--- word is used more than once in a film, it automatically gets an ""R"" rating, and the F--- word was used several times, though once would've been more than enough.  I have no idea why the director, Steven Soderbergh, decided to take an ""R"" rating for a few choice words that really made no difference in the quality of the movie.  I personally think it would've been better to skip the F--- word and to see Ms. Blanchett in nylons.  That would certainly have been more enjoyable.

The Good German centers on George Clooney's character, whose a newspaper reporter for the Army and is in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference with Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.  He hasn't been in Berlin since before the war and doesn't recognize anything.  His driver is Corporal Tobey Maguire, who also dabbles in the black market on the side to make some extra money.  Maguire is seeing Cate Blanchett's character, whose a prostitute and agrees to help her get out of Germany and to the United States.  The catch here is that the Russians and two separate departments in the Army are watching Blanchett, hoping that her SS Officer husband is still alive and that she'll eventually lead them to him.  Some of the people want her husband dead, while others want him alive because of his knowledge.  Tobey Maguire is killed off within the first third of the film for being too greedy.  George Clooney is beat up several times throughout the film as he tries to find out more about Blancett and her supposedly deceased husband.  Before the war, Blanchett worked for Clooney and had an affair with him.  He's still in love with her.  Because of his love, he offers to help her and her husband escape and nearly dies in the process.

The film, of course, is shot in black and white, and is modeled after the movies of the late thirties and forties.  Soderbergh does an excellent job of capturing that time period and of shooting the film just like a forties' director would've done.  The performances of all the actors are adequate for what they're doing.  There's no Oscar caliber acting in this film, but the performers still do their part to carry the film along.  I was a little confused at the end with all the information that's presented to Clooney's character about Blanchett and her husband and why everybody is after him, but up until that point I thought the movie was rather suspenseful and well done.  It definitely held my interest.  Is this a movie that I'd want to see a second time?  No, but only because there's no stocking scene in it with Ms. Blanchett.  Had that been in the film, I would watch it over and over again!",1181606400,,3321,4.488333333333333
2801916,4,B000OY8NBK,"""The Good German"" is a tribute to the old Hollywood classics like ""Casablanca,"" which is the movie that this film tries so hard to emulate. Stylistically, ""The Good German"" is incredible. The entire movie is filmed in glistening black and white, and it's very hard to distinguish it from a movie that was made 60 years ago. The basic plot is pretty good, too: an American military journalist (George Clooney) arrives in post-war Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference, only to stumble into a murder plot involving his newly-appointed driver (Toby Maguire), a former flame (Cate Blanchett) and her not-quite-dead husband. Unfortunately, ""The Good German"" fails to generate a strong emotional response from the audience the way ""Casablanca"" does, which really takes away from the other wonderful accomplishments the talented director and cast managed to achieve.

Clooney delivers an excellent performance, but I was disappointed in Maguire, who seemed very out of place in the film. (Fortunately, his character doesn't stick around for very long.) However, the two shining stars of this film are Blanchett, who delivers a stunning performance in her mysterious role, and the cinematography itself, which is absolutely breathtaking. Being a huge fan of old movies, I really enjoyed this modern throwback to 1940s filmmaking. In my opinion, though, the graphic sexual content and foul language really took away from the classic aesthetic feel director Steven Soderbergh tried so desperately to recreate: it was unnecessary, and it really took away from all the other old-fashioned movie elements.

The final scene in the film is very obviously a recreation of the last scene in ""Casablanca."" Again, while I enjoyed the tribute, I felt that the last scene of ""The Good German"" severely lacked the same kind of emotion and passion that ""Casablanca"" has, which is a real shame. The acting was good, but I really didn't care about what happened to any of the characters, which signifies a major problem with the script.

I hope Soderbergh attempts to do another ""modern film noir"" movie eventually. He has the look of it down pat: now all he needs is a slightly stronger script, and we'll be back to the days of Bogart and Bergman in no time!",1181520000,6,2235,5.067934782608695
2801925,3,B000OY8NBK,"The cast is great, the look is right, the story complex and full of intrigue...so what went wrong?  Hard to pinpoint, but it was just flat.  First off, the music score stunk.  It was intrusive and, except in a few spots, it was mostly inappropriate.  And the out-of-step music seemed to me to echo the slightly off-step pace and delivery of the film.  Even though it looked great, it wasn't so much an homage as a film school exercise.  It tried to re-do and update a look and sensibility that is locked forever in the romantic bubble of its own time. The addition of franker sex and language, while more suited to our times, presented a dissonance to the overall scheme of the film, illustrating the difficulty of trying to re-imagine the romance of the 40's wartime dramas for our own, more divisive and cynical age.  It ended up an ungainly mix of Casablanca romance and Third Man disillusion.

That said, it was a worthy attempt, and I applaud the effort to try to do something different.  It held my interest, and I very much liked the performances, especially Cate Blanchett and Robin Wiegert.  Clooney and Maguire were okay, and it was an interesting story. But you never really felt a true connection between the characters.  At any rate, this was director Soderbergh's showcase, and I hope he will continue his chance-taking efforts.  This one didn't quite come off, but he took a healthy cut at it, and it is worth a look.",1181520000,,1432,4.616600790513834
2801926,2,B000OY8NBK,"I worry about director Steven Soderbergh. He's trying too hard to come up with ""something different."" New gimmicks do not a great film make. He's done phenomenal work in the past, including TRAFFIC and The OCEAN'S resurgence (i.e., OCEAN'S ELEVEN, etc.). These are straightforward stories with characters we can grasp, laugh at, or worry about. But then he stretches too far and comes up with EROS, SOLARIS (which wasn't too bad), and the bottom rung BUBBLE.

Attempting to capture some of that ancient Hollywood gold, Soderbergh puts up THE GOOD GERMAN, a black and white feature in the vein of CASABLANCA. But any resemblance to the former film ends with the lack of technicolor. Given a chop-shop style script, the success of the movie hung on the uncharacteristic style more than the acting, dialogue, or story. The unfortunate part about it is that it doesn't utilize the compelling narrative in which the film is based upon, the novel by Joseph Kanon.

The Good German, that term, is meant to denote a German who may have had ties to Nazi-ism but who's record was cleaned up (on paper) so that they could be exported from the country without the threat of being accused of war crimes. Never did this essential element come through on film. What did, though, was a mish-mash of scenes that seemed strung together without regard to story-flow nor character portrayal. We never care for -- or understand the motivations of -- any of these people.

The star is George Clooney (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) as Jacob ""Jake"" Geismer, a journalist sent to Berlin for the post-WWII Potsdam conference. Once there, we quickly learn that he's been here before. In fact, he was involved with a lovely (but married) German named Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett, BABEL). Lena is now involved with Corporal Patrick Tully (Tobey Maguire, THE ICE STORM) who also happens to be Jake's back-stabbing driver. Is this all coincidence? Jake soon finds out that Lena's supposedly dead husband may have important documents those at the Potsdam conference want to keep quiet (i.e., destroy). When Tully turns up dead, the heat hits Jake full-on, sparking up his naturally inquisitive journalist mind. Everyone has an agenda and wants something from each other.

And that's about it...

The looping of intrigue is nothing new to cinema, but it can be done correctly if the acting and story are entertaining. You won't find that here. The characters/actors are wooden at best, which is quite a surprise considering the high-caliber cast. Lacking this, one would hope to find a pearl of success somewhere within the script. Not so. Again, it has a haphazard feel with poor fluidity.

In the end, it is the filming technique and in-you-face style that stands out over anything of substance. If you really want to know what a Good German is, read Kanon's novel and skip Soderbergh's interpretation.",1180656000,2,2868,4.927536231884058
2801927,4,B000OY8NBK,"George Clooney and Cate Blanchett headline in this hard-hitting, rough-edged homage to WWII-era war films and postwar film noir.  The film is shot in black-and-white and both borrows from and defies the cinematographic conventions of the time: the shadows are well-defined, the actors are boldly marked with strong key lights, yet the whites and lighter sections are often flared out and hazy, more like the wartime newsreels, which were shot on the fly rather than on some Hollywood set.  This is a good metaphor for the film as well: it's difficult to see the light amid the darkness and grime of a decimated Berlin.  Director Stephen Soderberg pays homage to many classic films -- ""Casablanca,"" ""The Third Man,"" et.al. -- but he also make use of the documentary feel of Frank Capra's wartime training films and the desolate, grainy footage of the liberation period.  The story is unremittingly dark and cynical, as Clooney's optimistic tough-guy hero is repeatedly pummeled both by Spillane/Chandler goons and by the force of history, the optimism of prewar America is battered as well...

  The plot is not so much weak as it is mis-directed with a final that screams for additional footage.

2801930,4,B000OY8NBK,"In THE GOOD GERMAN, Steven Soderburgh does an amazingly good job of recreating the noir look, sound, and feel of Michael Curtiz's classic 1940s Warner Brothers productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passage-to-Marseille/dp/079074886X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passage to Marseille</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-Voyager/dp/B0008ENIKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now, Voyager</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/6305736650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>, so much so that I expected Madeleine LeBeau, Leonid Kinskey and Marcel Dalio to play the bit parts.

Shot in black and white with incandescent lighting, recorded with boom mikes, and using fixed focus lenses, Soderburgh makes this film an homage to the era of the wartime melodrama.

George Clooney plays Jake Geisman, a war correspondent returned to his prewar posting, Berlin, just as the Potsdam Conference gets under way in Berlin (July 1945). As is natural, Jake tries to reconnect with his Berlin past, only to find himself drawn into a murder mystery shaped and defined by the nascent Cold War. As Jake blunders from situation to situation trying to discover the truth, he loses his postwar innocence and optimism.

Along with others, Jake also gets into a lot of fights with a character I eventually dubbed ""The Mysterious Man Who Hits People In The Head."" Said Mysterious Man appears so often that I suggested changing the name of the film from ""Der Gute Deutsch"" to ""Klop en Kopf.""

Also starring Cate Blanchett as Jake's former lover, Lena Brandt (""Why are you throwing away women like that? Someday they may be rationed"") and Tobey Maguire as an amoral American GI and black-marketeer, Sgt. Tully (""You do despise me Rick, don't you?""), the four-letter dialogue and frank sexual situations belie both the atmosphere and the straight-ahead Forties-style plot to indicate that this is a retrospective, not a re-creation.

So much of THE GOOD GERMAN samples films from the era that part of a cinemaphile's enjoyment of watching comes down to, ""I saw that in . . ."" This is particularly true of the ending, which will be instantly familiar but strangely unrecognizable.

2801932,3,B000OY8NBK,"Steven Soderbergh's THE GOOD GERMAN puts me in mind of Wolfgang Staudte's excellent film, DIE MOERDER SIND UNTER UNS (The Murderers are Among Us), which was the first film to be produced in post-war Germany. Both movies are set amid the ruins of Berlin (Truemmerfilm)--both in the Soviet Zone, in fact.  Both feature a beautiful German woman who is involved with a ""good German"", that is, a man of conscience had been forced to serve in the Nazi regime.  I enjoyed this new Hollywood film noir, but I found it a bit ""colorless"" at times: the lackluster execution misses the drama worthy of this important and creative concept, compared to the more suspenseful and memorable THE MURDERERS ARE AMONG US.

Cate Blanchett's character, Lena Brandt tries to escape from Germany and is burdened with the dark secrets of her past; Susanne Waller in the 1946 film returns to Berlin after being imprisoned in a concentration camp, and she tries to bring order to the rubble of her apartment and to create a new life and future for herself.  Although Susanne suffers unjustly in the war,  she returns to Berlin and puts the past behind her. Lena, on the other hand,  basically sells herself in order to survive and to avoid the horrible suffering of the war, and to avoid dire post-war consequences.  Her main goal is to get out of Berlin, but, by her own admission, she can never really leave Berlin (i.e. her past).  Apparent from the start is that Lena sells her body in order to get what she wants, but we only learn the full truth of her complicity in war crimes at the very end, as she leaves Jake Geismer (Clooney) to board a plane and leave Germany. (Casablanca-esque)

The ""good German"" in the modern film noir is the continually hunted Emil Brandt, whereas the good German of the older, East German film is the  haunted Hans Merten.  Both movies illustrate the fact that there were indeed those few souls who were able to see the Nazi agenda for the evil that it was,  and not succumb to the prevailing propaganda.  But THE MURDERERS ARE AMONG US is does so more successfully and memorably. I do like the brave little Emil Brandt, who kept lists and records of the atrocities he witnessed.  Though he seems meek in comparison to Lena, he is really the courageous one because he risks his life for the truth and whereas she is the cowardly one who will stop at nothing to save her own hide.  But where's the panic, where's the horror?  Even the sewer doesn't seem to stink in THE GOOD GERMAN.  Hans Merten, on the other hand, is a tortured soul.  He can't get a grip on himself after the crimes which he witnessed and was forced to be party to.  This feels more real.  How can a person of conscience survive the horrors of war so calmly unaffected?  Merten's shows serious signs of post-traumatic stress.  Brandt, just feels a bit claustrophobic down unter there.

I found this parallel between these two old and new films interesting. In my opinion, THE GOOD GERMAN is good, but THE MURDERERS ARE AMONG US, which is also available through Amazon, is better. Watch them both and see what you think.",1180310400,2,3096,4.599271402550091

2801934,4,B000OY8NBK,"Viewers are split on reaction to Steven Soderbergh's experimental THE GOOD GERMAN and for good reason. The theatrical and cinematic qualities of this film noir are stunning, creating not only a flashback to the 1940s films but to the period of the 1940s in postwar Europe.  The story is rich in suspense, visual surprises, and intrigue, and manages to unfold a complex tale involving many characters in a manner that keeps the viewer guessing about the outcome until the final image fades.  But the film takes a hefty does of patience to appreciate.

Potsdam conference, 1945 in decimated Berlin is the scene.  Capt. Jacob 'Jake' Geismer (George Clooney) arrives to observe and report on the conference and is assigned a driver named Tully (Tobey Maguire), a fast talking, manipulative opportunist who loves post-war Berlin for the easy money it allows a doofus like him to make.  Tully happens to have a lover, the mysterious  Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), who he is trying to assist in escaping from Germany.  As luck would have it Lena had been a previous lover of Jake in his prior time in Berlin.  The action begins when the Russians, the British, and the Americans reveal their attempt to locate rocket scientist Emil Brandt, Lena's husband who she declares has been long dead.  A murder occurs, espionage takes over and the film runs its cat and mouse chase for the discovery of the real Emil Brandt and the secrets his capture represent at this crucial junction in time - the Potsdam Conference.

The characters in the film come close to being caricatures: Ravil Isyanov as the main Russian figure, Beau Bridges and Jack Thompson as the main American figures, Robin Weigert as the requisite good prostitute/stripper roommate of Lena, Tony Curran representing the British presence, and Don Pugsley as the German evil presence that ties the whole story together.  Blanchett is her usual splendid self, adding a true sense of mystery and allure to her multifaceted role, George Clooney is on target as Jake, and Tobey Maguire manages to get on our nerves as the nerdy but clever Tully.  The pleasure in this film comes from Soderbergh's mastery of the medium not only as director but as cinematographer, and by Thomas Newman's period perfect score as orchestrated by the immensely talented Thomas Pasatieri fleshes out the film's effect.

Knowing that public and critical reaction is split, the film is a good evening of adventure: every viewer will elect which side of the critique to follow.  Grady Harp, May 07",1180224000,2,2518,4.936018957345971
2801935,2,B000OY8NBK,"This film bears so little resemblance to the book that I don't know how they can even use the name.  While those who have not read the book will no doubt find some redeeming features in the movie, I wonder if those who read the book were as disappointed as I was, especially with the unemotional acting and lack of intrigue.  I could not have cared less about any of the characters and it certainly did not have the post-war atmosphere of Berlin that the book had. I guess that is the problem with seeing a movie made from a book one has really enjoyed - disappointment - but not usually to this extent.",1180137600,2,603,4.280701754385965
2801936,2,B000OY8NBK,"I have to say Steven Soderberg is maybe not a great director, but he is certainly balsy. This guy takes some really really bold chances with his directorial choices. Beginning with Sex, Lies & Videotape, he has taken some other unorthodox approaches like KAFKA, TRAFFIC, FULL FRONTAL, BUBBLE & now, the GOOD GERMAN.

With the GOOD GERMAN, he chooses to mimic the style of the 40s and 50s. Full Frame. Black and white. Casablanca. Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. Stage sets. Dialogue delivery dramatic & brooding. An ending sequence that was ripped straight from a Hitchcock film with the chase through a crowd of people, with the speed slightly cranked and the tension manipulated.

His duplication of the films of the 40s & 50s was well done, but he also chooses to give us something that the movies of the 40s & 50s didn't have: A graphic sex scene, language & a man punching a woman in the gut. It was a weird mix, but strangely enough, interesting and not the problem with the film.

The problem with the film is that it quite simply falls off the table around the halfway point. The story stopped growing and the film became a talky, unsuspensful bore. Films of the 40s & 50s WERE talky and back then, they worked. This film could have worked, but when it stopped growing, it became predictable and painfully boring.",1180137600,,1331,4.703862660944206
2801937,3,B000OY8NBK,"""The Good German"" reminds me of the sauerkraut I had to eat as a kid. Sauerkraut is an acquired taste. It looked like sauerkraut but I remember hating the taste. Why? Because my mom just couldn't get the flavor for it right and we often had it from a can. I'm not sure that I would have ever acquired a taste for sauerkraut even if it was homemade but canned sauerkraut captured the ""look"" of the dish but lacked everything else. While ""The Good German"" looks good it misses the essence of the 40's melodramas it's trying to duplicate. The film however certainly has its merits.

Director Steven Soderbergh affectionately recreates the look of melodramas that were popular in the 1940's with this film. ""The Good German"" recalls both ""Casablanca"" crossed with ""The Third Man"" with its moody black and white cinematography (done by Soderbergh himself under the pseudonym ""Peter Andrews""). While not entirely successfully, ""The Good German"" does try to marry a 21st century sensibility with its mixture of profanity and the look of a 1945 studio film. Set in post-war Germany just before the Potsdam accord where President Harry Truman, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin divided up Europe, American journalist Jake Geismer (George Clooney) comes over to cover the historical event taking place but suddenly finds he's trapped in a web of deceit, double-crosses and lies regarding the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. The key to it all is a Lena (Cate Blanchett) a former stringer for the reporter who provided reports from Germany in the early days of the war and his former lover. She has now taken up with Tully (Tobey Maguire) a military man doing anything he can to exploit post-War Germany and make a buck in an effort to escape her past and try to escape Berlin as well. Whatever the Americans and Soviets are after, they are willing to murder anyone that gets in their way to use Lena for their own ends.

Soderbergh's film hits all the right technical points including using visual references to other classic melodramas from Hollywood's Golden Age but lacks the soul of those films. The script by Paul Attanasio (from the novel by Joseph Kanon) seems as disjointed and emotionless as Soderbergh's glacial direction. ""The Good German"" is all about the ""look"" of the film and surfaces providing an excellent example in recreating the techniques of 40's films without having any of the emotional content. Don't get me wrong ""The Good German"" isn't a bad film--viewers will have a hard time connecting with the characters and being pulled into the film. The mystery at its heart just isn't made compelling enough by the disjointed narrative and even the performances are all about recreating the right ""moments"" from previous films not about creating memorable moments of the performers own. This is the kind of film that you might have casually watched on TV while doing the dishes and other chores without truly becoming involved enough to actually sit down and watch it. The film is R rated for profanity and sexual situations neither one of which would have made it into a 1940's melodrama.

The DVD doesn't have any extras which is too bad--it would have allowed the director to elaborate on his experiment and assess where it succeeded and failed. The film looks quite good with some stunning black and white photography that captures the shimmering whites and rich blacks that were characteristic of films from the time.

Although ""The Good German"" doesn't taste genuine, it certainly looks it. While I didn't find it emotionally involving, it's an entertaining movie that reminds me of some of Hitchcock's technical experiments like ""Rope"" where the technique was far more important than the material. It's a solid rental for fans of 40's films recapturing an era long gone.",1180051200,2,3820,4.945482866043614

2801939,3,B000OY8NBK,"(2 1/2 *'s)  It's no surprise after the success of `Good Night and Good Luck,' George Clooney and Steven Sodenheim would team up to create another vintage historical drama of great import.  Unfortunately, despite being filmed in stunning black and white and recorded with an authentically old-fashioned score, the movie threads together monumental history and a detective tale in a way that isn't as cohesive or focused as the former triumph.  There are solid moments to be sure:  Clooney plays U.S. army correspondent, Jake Geismer (Clooney), relocating to Germany to seek normalcy and find Lena (Cate Blanchett) an old flame.  In the midst of the drama are stunning newsreels of Potsdam as both Superpowers seek German war rocket scientist, Franz Bettman (David Willis), a human focal point demonstrating the emerging Cold War.  Impressively, they give us a feel for Europe (particularly Berlin) as it's being divied up between the power brokers.

The story starts solidly enough with an army driver, Patrick Tully (performed with punk kid-toughness by Tobey McGuire) who picks up Jake and quickly makes a connection with Lena, whom Tully keeps like a pimp possession.  From there Jake connects the dots in his investigation that brings him more and more mystery than he originally bargained for.  Some of the film's best moments come when they pause to reflect on the aftermath of the war and it's ramifications for psychological casualties in the film's present (July, 1945) and their future.  (A poignant reminder comes into play when one camera store owner is shown strapped to a rolling dolly because he lost his legs in The War.)

Some of the tough, private eye maneuvering by Clooney and (especially) a fine performance by the versatile Blanchett, we get the goods, even if at times the mixture doesn't always translate into the sort of urgency we'd expect from such important material.  Kudos for the authenticity, though. If there weren't expletives in the movie, I'd have sworn I was watching a flick from the forties.  Clooney's no Humphrey Bogart, and Blanchett is (almost) no Ingrid Bergman, but with a few tense scenes and some big ideas, they almost pull it off.",1179878400,2,2179,5.053072625698324
2801940,2,B000OY8NBK,"Art seems inevitably to belong to its historical moment.  'The Third Man' and 'Casablanca' are echoed, as other reviers have noted, but there is also a sharper contemporary edge in terms of sexual content, general cynicism and nastiness and exceptionally coarse language.

One contemporary film that 'The Good German' calls to my mind is 'Sin City', also a kind of pastiche of film noir.  It even has multiple narrators!

As much as I appreciated the use of 1940s production techniques and enjoyed the music, 'The Good German' left me admiring even more the films to which it pays homage.  The appeal of those movies now is largely that they don't rely on cheap sensationalism and special effects but instead excel at things like plot, character and dialogue.  They also have a moral center that later films lack.

Because of the Hays code, film-makers of the era had to suggest a great deal more than they could spell out.  'The Good German' has none of that subtlety, wit or inventiveness, and so seems kind of dumb and unsophisticated by comparison.

The script is lacklustre and none of the characters were people I really cared about. Needless to say, Clooney, Blanchett and Maguire are good actors but here pale in comparison to the likes of Bogart, Bergman and Welles.  If the film-makers had been really serious about recreating the 1940s, they would have been faithful to the milieu in which the films  were made as well as reproducing the technical features of the period.",1173484800,,1482,4.841269841269841
2801941,4,B000OY8NBK,"Despite what other reviewers said, including those in the local newspaper, I found this mystery entertaining. I went with somewhat lowered expectations.

It is wonderous, if only for the masterful black and white photography. There is something deeply mysterious about highlighted cigarette smoke in a dark room. See the Carroll Reed/Orson Wells classic ""The Third Man"" & ""Casablanca"" before seeing this movie, this borrows heavily from both. Full of dirt and bombed out rubble, like The Third Man. The Third Man? Casablanca ? #57 & #2 on American Film Institute's List: Top 100 Greatest Movies? For those who never see anything over 20 years old, movies worth seeing!

Director Soderbergh didn't do a period piece, he did a real authentic forties movies with old cameras and old filming techniques. Orson Wells once said words to the effect that ""Did you ever see a good dramatic performance in a color film? All the really good performances are in black and white, Color really distracts..."" This is a good example of what artistic black and white can do.

Goegrge Clooney plays Jake, (the Holly Martins type character), searching for Lena (like Anna) an old friend in post WWII Berlin, who used to be a reporter and is now a prostitute. Lena seems to be a minor character at first. I won't reveal more of the plot. Seamless integration of post war footage and the current movie, for film buffs this is a visual treat. A more complex, violent, and more sexual mystery than the Third Man but authentic to the period.  You even have Lena walking through the sewers under Berlin (in high heels!) to search for,... well, see the movie. Just like the finale of The Third Man.

One expects to hear Anton Karas's zither playing ""The Harry Lime Theme"" or ""The Cafe Mozart Waltz"" from a cafe in the bombed-out city!

It's a tad long but it has the substance of older movies. Yes, it does lack emotion - esp. anger. A pervasive sense of postwar gloom and powerlessness runs through the lead characters. But even with it's flaws, it's an adult movie, and it's much better than 90% of what's out today.

Underappreciated, but with many virtues. True Film Noir.",1171411200,43,2150,4.7789757412398925
2801942,5,B000OY8NBK,"""The Good German"" provides viewers with intriguing film noir related to a war setting.  Director Steve Soderbergh opted for a black and white treatment of a film based in war torn Germany at the end of the conflict for a very good reason.

Some reviewers were critical of using film noir format at a current point of film making when war ravaged Germany could have been shown using the latest in color technology.  ""What was the point of it?"" critics have asked pertaining to Soderbergh's decision.

As someone who has written two books on the subject of film noir, I will use the opportunity to jump into Soderbergh's shoes and explain what I would presume his motivation to be.  While so many critics remain ensconced in the captivating old detective genre starring a Robert Mitchum, Dick Powell or Humphrey Bogart, war provides a starkness all its own.

In viewing ""The Good German"" I concluded that the starkness of black and white suited the tenor, tone and mood of a drama set against the rubble of the great city of Berlin after the destruction of war had taken its tragic toll.

As for the dramatic elements, George Clooney was ideal as the war reporter who returns to Germany after hostilities have ended and reheats old passions with sleek, sexy and very savvy Cate Blanchett.  When he learns that she has been having an affair with the young soldier who has been assigned to be his driver Clooney becomes disgusted, seeking to learn more about a woman he now believes to be a self-serving opportunist up to her eyeballs in intrigue.

After having a violent physical confrontation with his young driver, Clooney becomes more curious as the driver's body washes up on shore after his corpse has been floating in the river.  The reporter becomes more determined to find out more about the woman who had been his lover.  He is now convinced that he knew far less about than he had earlier believed.

Cate Blanchett plays her role of a lady of mystery with consummate skill.  She immerses herself in her role as a German so well that she is physically unrecognizable from the star that played another great actress named Kate with a ""K"", namely Hepburn in ""The Aviator.""

At the film's end Clooney's confrontation with Blanchett reveals her as someone determined to survive during a war period and in a city where bodies are falling all around her.

The lesson to be learned is that life is a battle for survival and that the Blanchetts of the world are the most skilled at playing it, enhancing their chances to endure.  Philosophers continue to ponder the question of the morality of tactics pursued that would be anything but acceptable under less compelling circumstances.",1169683200,66,2682,4.760259179265659
2801943,2,B000OY8NBK,"Classic film noir has a crisp, high-contrast look. ""The Good German"" has gauzy, soft-focus cinematography that would be more appropriate in a perfume commercial. The mushy images and consistently overexposed highlights make the film hard on the eyes and a chore to watch.

The poor cinematography might be tolerable if the script were worthwhile. Unfortunately, the script is even worse than the photography. The story plods from one uninteresting plot point to another with no sense of momentum. The acting is nothing special, either -- not that anyone could save such an ugly, badly written film.

The obvious comparison is to Jacques Tourneur's ""Berlin Express,"" a 1948 noir set in post-war Berlin. Tourneur's film is one of his weaker efforts, but it's a minor masterpiece compared to Soderbergh's failed pseudo-noir.",1168992000,9,821,5.3076923076923075

8187157,4,B000OY8NBK,"I haven't read the book, which other reviewers say far surpasses the film, so I'm in no position to judge its faithfulness to the original.  But Steven Soderbergh was interested in making the latter, and in this media it's the visual that matters: there's little time for complexities and internal contradictions, except as expressed through direct action and dialogue.  Plot and characters must be kept simple.  And as a film maker Soderbergh was also trying to recreate - as well as postwar Berlin - the look and feel of period noir.  In this sense his production (can't speak for the book) is a synthesis of ""Casablanca"" - lost love returned (especially the last disappointment at the airport runway in the rain); ""The Third Man,"" in murderous postwar intrigue under four-power occupation; and ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" where fatuous cold war politics overshadow the search for justice in the rubble.  By keeping to period black and white he was also able to integrate 1945 footage of bombed Berlin as backdrop.  The production weaves this seamlessly through its scrupulous attention to the fashions, architecture, and other nuances of time and place.  (Though I'll agree with one reviewer - as upper middle class Americans, the actors can't quite look starved and conniving enough for postwar survivors.)

Good production.  Watch it first, then read the book.  Never expect the two to equate; sometimes, as in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" the film can actually be much better.",1519948800,,1475,5.08298755186722
