3853946,5,B0026IUSV0,Wonderful opportunity to 'see' Pink Martini in Concert. They have only made one visit to Scotland. Would be wonderful if they cold return before too long. Great concert but did not include my favourite song 'je ne veux pas travailler'! More please. Kay,1246233600,2,252,4.883720930232558

3853948,5,B0026IUSV0,"I love this group!!! If you enjoy good alternative music and good visual display, this could be an excellent DVD to add to your collection. The instrumentation is eclectic & the voice or voices in harmony are quite pleasant. Great selections, original & traditional.",1412380800,,266,5.068181818181818
3853949,5,B0026IUSV0,"This is one of the best concerts I have bought, I love it, any moment I have time I play it and enjoy it. This kind of music is excellent, the latin music, jazz, blues, brazilian, great, I love the way the musician played and enjoyed, people watching the orchestra, etc. Fabuloso, excelente!",1411516800,,291,4.509433962264151
3853950,5,B0026IUSV0,"Oh, I hardly know what new expletives to use in describing Pink Martini:  Ditto, ditto, ditto. If you don't know what I'm reiterating; they are clever, witty, several-language-literate, musically disposed, happy, appreciated, and just fun to listen to.",1404950400,,252,5.631578947368421
3853951,5,B0026IUSV0,"Great band, great music. Loved the sound, the lighting and the way the dvd was shot. I'm a big fan.",1397260800,,99,4.0
3853952,5,B0026IUSV0,"The performers, particularly the singer and the guitar player, are great.  This DVD is about good
music and not just a lot of noise.  The performers all appear to enjoy their craft and it showed.  I loved it.",1389484800,,208,4.421052631578948
3853953,5,B0026IUSV0,"I discovered Pink Martini after watching a movie and they had a song in it - I watched the credits and went immediately to Amazon and bought my first CD.  Since then, I have purchased every Pink Martini CD they have published.  They are a fabulous group that sing in several different languages besides English.  The words are always published in a booklet with the CDs
I love this group and I encourage anyone that is interested to listen to the sample cuts.  Then buy it!!",1381881600,,474,4.476744186046512
3853954,4,B0026IUSV0,"excellent, love them, saw them performed at the Stern Grove, SF Park, the park was packed with people, they played to the  full crowd, people were dancing to their delight and satisfaction.  Everybody enjoyed the afternoon.  They played  a lot of music from the records I purchased.",1378166400,,282,4.9361702127659575
3853955,4,B0026IUSV0,"This is a great concert spoiled only by the poor sound quality of the DVD.

They are a superb group of musicians and the quality of their music deserves better than the quality of the sound on the disc.",1370822400,,202,4.17948717948718
3853956,5,B0026IUSV0,"I hope someday to see ""Pink Martini perform live; however, in the meantime, where DO I begin!  Listening to their CD's and watching their DVD give me joy, make me laugh, grin.  Their individual performances are phenomenal and the lyrics....
I should probably mention, I work out on the elliptical to this DVD.  I drag myself in for some much-needed exercise, insert ""Pink Martini"" in the DVD and have so much fun, quite often, after 45 min I decide to continue until the concert ends with ""Brazil""!",1367539200,,498,4.7011494252873565
3853957,3,B0026IUSV0,"I bought this and A Retrospective on a friend's recommendation; this CD  would not play in my PC running Windows 8 and Windows Media Player, but the other did.  I was going to return it but tried it in the car CD player, and it worked fine.  Go figure.  It turned out to be a series of concert performances, which was a bit disappointing.  The other CD was a lot better.",1366416000,,370,4.154929577464789
3853958,5,B0026IUSV0,...you'll love this CD. It is simply the cats meow of Martini music. Highly recommended! Gave it as a gift to a close friend and it ended up being one of the best nights of my life! ;),1364515200,,184,3.8684210526315788
3853959,5,B0026IUSV0,I love this material. The show itself is nothing special but it is absolutely great to have some visual material of this outstanding group! I do recommend this.,1348617600,,160,4.75
3853960,5,B0026IUSV0,"What's better than a Pink Martini CD? Pink Martini live!
Thanks to a 2009 PBS Special, this great CD is a live concert recorded on stage at the historic Portland Theater in Portland, Oregon. Favorite  moments: when each artist in their ""little orchestra"" got to shine; their joy in playing; the 4-year-old in the audience in her birthday crown sitting rapt, loving it all; the grande finale of exuberant feathered Brazilian dancers. And of course, That Voice, China Forbes! And to get a firsthand look at Thomas Lauderdale's athletic keyboard style!
Ooolala! Ol! Mamma mia!",1336089600,4,573,5.031578947368421
3853961,4,B0026IUSV0,Gave as a gift.  He really liked it.  Got to know the group history and to find out what they are all about.,1332115200,,108,3.652173913043478
3853962,5,B0026IUSV0,"THE PERFORMANCES ON THIS DVD ARE SO WONDERFUL I ALMOST CRIED WATCHING IT.  AND IT BUILDS TO A CLIMAX THAT IS SO INVOLVING THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE. IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER, RUN, DON'T WALK, AND GET THIS DVD! I FOUND THE SOUND QUALITY TO BE VERY GOOD.  I MENTION THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THE SOUND WAS NOT AS GOOD AS PINK MARTINI CDS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1331424000,,397,4.28
3853963,5,B0026IUSV0,"Having seen Pink Martini in concert 4 times, this dvd provides a great nostalgic treat.
Watching the group as they perform their music is a fun way to pass the time.",1313366400,,165,4.354838709677419
3853964,5,B0026IUSV0,"I love, love, love, Pink Martini. Their music is so fresh and fun. I eagerly await each and every new album. To see them in person is always a great treat.",1311033600,,155,4.032258064516129
3853965,5,B0026IUSV0,"This is a great concert; was originally broadcast on PBS who made a video. So, this was a repeat.  Made a great gift.  Terrific photo on the cover!",1295222400,,147,4.214285714285714
3853966,5,B0026IUSV0,"Pink Martini, a globe-trotting band, produces a video that is well put together and shows a wide variety of expert performances by China Forbes singing in several languages, including Japanese. Personal interviews are interspersed, enhancing the production. This band (which has graced Carnegie Hall) not only comes up with its own clever creations, but also takes classics like ""Malaguena"" and ""Amado Mio"" (the latter being a song that hearkens back to the 40's and Rita Hayworth) and infuses the music with modern, full-bodied instrumentation and Latin rhythm. These are highly professional musicians who love their work. Great band. Great DVD.",1285459200,9,646,5.47
3853967,5,B0026IUSV0,Brilliant concert DVD.  Enjoyable comments from the band.  Only complaint is the sound is only stereo disappointing when there are so many options available. However it's a great DVD and well worth buying!,1278892800,,205,5.181818181818182
3853968,4,B0026IUSV0,"I bought this as a present for my son, who had it on his Amazon wish list.

I'd had no previous experience with or knowledge of Pink Martini, and thought them just another of the current crop of cookie cutter bands with lifeless lyrics. I could not have been more wrong. My son played this for us and we made a delightful discovery.

Pink Martini's music is very retro ... think the musical numbers in movies of the 30s and 40s (the good ones). Their songs have various international flavors. They are interesting, entertaining, and catchy. If you haven't heard Pink Martini and have an interest in the genre I just described, I urge you to at least listen to their song previews for an album. That will help you to decide whether you will care for this DVD.",1276819200,7,758,4.446043165467626
3853969,5,B0026IUSV0,"I first saw/heard of PM on PBS, I'm sure many others are Same.

(much as I 'hate' to say it) IF you haven't seen Pink Martini in person (me X 3) YOU HAVEN'T LIVED.

THEY WILL  ROCK YOU, they will lay you down in the aisles.
they look good, they Sound FABULOUS, and they will leave you WANTING MORE.

(anything else I could say would take away from the description)",1271462400,6,364,4.1571428571428575
3853970,5,B0026IUSV0,"I love Pink Martini!  I have never seen Pink Martini Live in Concert. My nephew gave me this DVD for Christmas! I know it is not as good as seeing them live. But their  DVD is the next best thing.  It made me appreciate all the members even more, than just listening to their music.
They sing with such passion and energy.  It is terrific.  I  do think the DVD sound is not as good as their records.  However, all the things you see and learn about during the concert performance, their bio video and especially their Polaroids made this a new and wonderful experience.

If you like jazz, fun loving music, in 5 different languages you will love this DVD.  As you can tell I am a avid fan.  So, I am bias.  China Forbes and the bandleader piano player are both so talented.",1267574400,15,773,4.2620689655172415
3853971,5,B0026IUSV0,Outstanding DVD!  Great to watch with sound system cranked right!  Enjoyable band to watch...,1265587200,,93,5.571428571428571
3853972,5,B0026IUSV0,"Having been a fan for a while, and seeing PM in concert over the summer, I think the DVD is delightful.  I bought the first copy at the show, and have been to Amazon several times to send copies to friends.  This is real entertainment that does not rely on vulgarity or profanity.  Though I sometimes love those things, these are REALLY talented people who are doing something completely ""outside the box.""  It's about time we get such an ingenious and important and ground breaking ensemble as Pink Martini.  Fan forever!",1259971200,,522,4.6923076923076925
3853973,4,B0026IUSV0,I recommend this for every Pink Martini fan. Not as good as seeing them live but very nice. Well produced. The Polaroid picture collection additional feature is very cool,1252281600,4,170,4.896551724137931
3853974,4,B0026IUSV0,"Recin recib el disco Hey Eugene! y me qued prendado de la msica de esta agrupacin. Inmediatamente busqu el DVD y decid comprarlo. Efectivamente tenan razn los usuarios que dicen que la calidad de audio es un tanto decepcionante, ya que slo se puede escuchar en estreo y dado que es una verdadera orquesta, hubiera sido excelente contar con una buena mezcla de audio. Pero bien es cierto que se disfruta mucho ver y escuchar este DVD.",1250553600,,433,4.636363636363637
3853975,3,B0026IUSV0,"Pink Martini makes wonderful music on CDs, but they are at their best in concert.  This DVD gives a flavor of their concert performance, but the quality of the DVD is not the best.  It does not have any options for surround sound or anything else.  The good news is that I saw them recently in concert, and China Forbes said that they would have a new CD in October 2009 and a new live DVD in a year.  I hope that the new DVD will be of better quality.  In the meantime, this DVD is recommended for anyone who has not seen them in concert.  They are wonderful artists and performers with an amazing repertoire of music.",1247097600,26,619,4.203389830508475
3853976,4,B0026IUSV0,"Having enjoyed Pink Martini performing live at two different venues set me up for a bit of a disappointment in viewing a recorded show.

But the editing was excellent, the sound quality is lacking.

However anyone who has not attended a live performance and truly appreciates superb, professional musicians enjoying their craft will definitely appreciate this dvd.",1246752000,22,364,5.368421052631579
