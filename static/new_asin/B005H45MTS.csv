8472673,5,B005H45MTS,"I'm currently a Tan Belt in the American Cane System, the highest rank I've obtained in several martial arts experiences.  The major reason for this is the quality of my instructor and the availability of the instructional CDs.  These CDs cover all the required learning in a clear, comprehensive and concise manner, and are always a ready reference as needed.",1437350400,2,360,4.983333333333333
8472674,5,B005H45MTS,"This DVD is great!  I have this as well as Levels 2 -6.  The American Cane System Ranking Series are a step by step instructional videos.  Each DVD not only has detailed instructions on techniques; they have additional exercises with the resistance bands, with in depth explanations on how and why these exercises are important and improve you overall health.  I like the practical applications shown in the Kata section, which help students understand what the moves are actually doing when used on an attacker.  Each DVD builds on the previous level.  I have watched all of them several times.  I like the feature that allows you to just skip to a particular segment, if that is all that you want to work on on a particular day.",1435708800,4,730,4.65625
