The only thing that is wrong with it (and makes it an absolute non-starter for me!) is: it has NO subtitles.",1484697600,,134,4.153846153846154
8363258,4,B002C67BJI,"This is either the second or third year I have gotten this DVD from Netflix during the Christmas season, but only the first time I've watched it.  In the past year or years, Christmas was over before I could view it and I just sent it back unwatched.  This year I decided it would be one of my Christmas wrapping background shows, and it ended up interfering with my wrapping.  Although the picture quality is not the greatest, it's a pretty good story about a church choir that gets a new director who wants to do Handel's Messiah.  John Houseman plays the new director perfectly, and I even really liked Michael Learned, who has never been a favorite of mine.  Ramon Bieri, an excellent TV character actor, also was very likable, and I think it's the first time I've ever seen him in a romantic type role.

Romance is not a major theme of this 1980 movie, however.  It's more about fellowship and how church members can become like family members, helping each other out and doing fun things together.  The one huge flaw of the movie, however, was the need to throw in a crisis after so many minutes without one. Characters end up at the police station and the hospital. Too bad.  The movie was good enough without all the unneeded drama.  Did it put me in a Christmas mood?  A little.  San Francisco just didn't seem that Christmassy.  I don't know, maybe it was the lack of snow.",1482364800,,1383,4.46215139442231

8363260,4,B002C67BJI,"Founded in 1993, Chandler, AZ. based AFA ENTERTAINMENT wholesales and retails PD motion pictures in both full and widescreen formats. Cover art is often repros of vintage movie posters. They also provide a transfer to DVD service for videotapes and 8mm home movies. Their film dubs offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Quality of these unrestored transfers is based on condition of source material, which can vary from very good to only fair.

Since this film was a pre-widescreen TV broadcast, AFA has either stretched (and thus distorted) the image, cut off the top and bottom, or used a combination of both to simulate a widescreen mivie.

In the most interesting made-for-TVer A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW, a divorcee from Nebraska relocates to San Francisco, where she rediscovers the spirit of Christmas through her inner-city church's choir. Their plans to perform Handel's Messiah are disrupted by vandalism.

Zoe Jensen (Learned) temporarily leaves her young son with his worried grandma and heads west to seek a teaching job. With no positions available, Zoe does clerical work at a number of offices. She joins a choir led by taskmaster Ephraim Adams (Houseman). As they rehearse a challenging Christmas concert program, tensions arise within the group.

Classically-trained Muriel (Curtin) bristles when she's passed over as solo soprano in favor of an amateur with a much softer voice. Elderly Inez (Nelson), a member for decades, can no longer carry a tune. Mr. Adams deftly handles both these issues, but little can be done when the church's pipe organ is severely damaged by an unknown attacker.

A young African-American baritone is arrested by police after being wrongly accused of the crime by another member. Worse, the cheesy electronic organ on 60 days trial keeps receiving police radio calls during mass! With no repair company available in time and their substitute organ malfunctioning, things look pretty bleak. And then, Mr. Adams suffers a stroke...
