8466747,4,B005DEUEW2,"No, this is not a movie about a Spanish or Italian submarine, but a story about two Danish brothers. As children they had no father, and their mother was a fall down drunk. They separate in adult life, and this is what most of the story is about. One is an alcoholic, the other into needle drugs. Needles has a kid who he can't support, so he turns to dealing. I think he wants the kid to have what he didn't no matter the consequences. Alki wants to recover, and to help himself and friends. This movie somehow got on my wish list, and I added to an order to make the free shipping limit. Glad I did, it was pretty decent",1458000000,,622,4.10655737704918

8466751,5,B005DEUEW2,"Brooding, but rewarding viewing.
Yes, it's about two brothers who were severely traumatized in childhood. And yes, they have not been able to adjust and create a ""normal"" life, with one recently released from jail (the reason of which is not divulged ) and one an addict. But as somber as it may seem, both retained their ""humanity"", as manifested in their intact capacity to care and love. One taking the blame for a crime he didn't commit to protect a friend and the other caring and loving his son. Their love for each other also intact. The end, although maybe uncertain of the future, gives a sense of ""closure"" and love. Jakob Cedergren proves himself (as in other films) to be a formidable actor with a quiet but strong presence.",1422230400,,736,4.625954198473282
8466752,2,B005DEUEW2,"The movie is excessively dramatic, the director stretches the story a bit too much in order to make it more crude, and I think it ends up not being credible.",1409616000,,157,4.266666666666667
8466753,5,B005DEUEW2,"Low key, thoughtful look into the spiraling lives of two brothers. Redemptive at the end, though.  Jakob Cedergren is one of my favorite actors. He can relay much emotion in a single look.",1370563200,,188,4.696969696969697
8466754,5,B005DEUEW2,"Submarino is one of the most troubling films I've ever seen.  Even more than, say, King of Devil's Island, it makes painfully clear just how costly the loss of innocence can be.  It's not an easy process for any of us, but the least fortunate suffer the deepest kind of emotional brutalization.  Imagine two brothers, both approaching middle school age, who have no humane choice but to care for an infant sibling in an atmosphere suffused with alcoholism, indifference, and cruelty.  Though untrained and ignorant of the needs of a baby, they take pride and pleasure in doing what seems morally right and technically correct, and they love the child.  Given their inevitable limitations, however, the death of the infant comes as no surprise, except, perhaps, to the brothers.

One wonders how they survived their own earliest years, and we are struck by their decency and their loving natures.  Still again, it's no surprise when, as adults, neither has escaped the emotional demons that were born during childhood and adolescence.

As is often the case with abused children, their lives, at first blush, seem to have gone in opposite directions.  One drinks large quantities of beer and lifts weights to better prepare him for a hard world where strength and toughness count.  A working class Lad who lives a life of little promise and even less meaning.  He remains, though, self-sufficient and durable, neither dependent nor despondent.  Its easy to imagine that he could go on more or less indefinitely in much the same way -- little to lose and nothing much gained.

While it's not as clear as it might be, the younger brother has taken a different path.  He looks and acts the part of a nerd, but one who has attained middle class status.  In spite of his unspecified but evident material and cultural attainments, however, he's much closer to the edge and apt to fall off than his seemingly less fortunate brother.  Whatever emotional resources keep his older brother from desperation, he does not share them.

Both characters are sufficiently well developed to make the film's narrative believable, though it would be useful to know more about the life of the younger sibling -- how does he make a living, how did he start a failed family, how did he manage for as long as he did with the dangerous and debilitating coping mechanism he adopted.  Still, the stark contrast between the lives of the two brothers is interesting, something commonly found among offspring who grew up in horrible circumstances of shared abuse.

Some viewers may conclude that there is redemption of a touching, even profound sort at the very end.  In truth, however, I don't see it.  Too much has been lost by too many, and the future remains a blank.  Those who wish to can understandably harken back to the beginning scenes and surmise love and happiness for the survivors.  I think, however, that so much has happened that has been so destructive that such a forecast is unduly sentimental.

In any case, this is a truly fine film, one that gets inside you head and, for better or worse, stays there.  The viewer can construe it as a ""wake up call"" if he or she likes.  I think that Submarino takes things that we know in a very abstract way and forces us to see them concretely.  It's then that they become so troubling and so disturbingly real.",1352764800,2,3337,4.758260869565217
8466755,4,B005DEUEW2,"The Scandinavians are excellent story tellers.  In large part thanks to the Dogme 95 movement which blossomed in 1995, film makers schooled in that era are now coming of age.  Lone Scherfig (An Education, One Day), Susanne Bier (In a Better World, After the Wedding), Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration-his best in my opinion-and Submarino), and the Lion King of them all Lars Von Trier (Melancholia, Breaking the Waves) are all fine craftsman who know know how to tell a good yarn.  I happened upon Danish film quite accidentally and now understand why it's taking its place at the film making table.  Submarmino however was too dark and gloomy for me. Kudos are to be given to the director Thomas Vinterberg, however, for over half of the cast were novices which lent a very realistic feel to the story. Almost too realistic. Still, I'd recommend this film over your usual Hollywood fare.",1333756800,3,890,4.874172185430464
