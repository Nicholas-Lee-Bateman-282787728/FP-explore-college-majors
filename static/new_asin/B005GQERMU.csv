8472165,5,B005GQERMU,"Science is not materialism. This film is the scientific pebble that brings down the  Goliath of Evolution, in less than an hour. I was priveleged to watch it shortly after it was made and the earth-shaking evidence it provides has anchored my intellectual life ever since, like a foundation stone. If you are a thinking person, you could not make a better investment than to own it.",1495065600,,382,4.701492537313433
8472166,5,B005GQERMU,"I found Donald Patten's scientific approach to a Biblical matter, both refreshing and novel. I too started with the same question as he. As a Christian I never ""question"" the Bible, although I find myself curious of unveiling events, but I believe God, even if He chooses not to reveal details.",1472601600,,294,4.784313725490196

8472170,5,B005GQERMU,"For as much as I've learned about the science in this video, I've never heard satisfying scientific arguments against it.  In fact, the most common argument I've heard is that since modern scientists don't agree with it, it must therefore be wrong.  But I tend to think that the greater scientific community can't allow for the factor of a supernatual being, and therefore any explanation must not allow for any super-natural occurrences or intervention.  The idea that the conditions outside must be constant and extremely slow in changing is not supported by the earth, the climate, or the planets in our own solar system and the universe beyond.  More likely, the scientific community has snubbed the work of Donald W. Patten and his theories because it supports the biblical claims of a young earth and a universal biblical flood.  Still, the points in this video, while severely dated, are well worth consideration by the viewer.  Don't cast it aside just because it is old.",1442534400,3,979,4.939024390243903
