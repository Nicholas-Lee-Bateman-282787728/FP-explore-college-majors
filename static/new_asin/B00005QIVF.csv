7950769,4,B00005QIVF,"Lau Ching Wan gives a strong but over-the-top performance as a very rough and mean natured gangster just out of prison, who has been abandoned by his gang. This is kind of a typical story about a very rough guy who has buried very deep a somewhat heart of gold. Both are really taken to extreme in typical Hong Kong style, and as Johnny To often does in many of his films about violent excess in the Hong Kong underworld. So this movie will not appeal to many western tastes. The contrast really is not believable, so it does detract some from the film. But this is made up for by Lau Chin Wan's supurb acting, and by Johnny To's tight directing. This is well worth watching, and is a good, rare Hong Kong drama.",1139702400,3,712,4.281481481481482
