8613824,4,B00FAOAI7G,"Great bonus pack of Stanwyck films. I bought it for ""There's Always Tomorrow"", but the others were all good, too. If you like Barbara Stanwyck, this is the buy for you.",1437782400,,168,4.451612903225806
8613825,4,B00FAOAI7G,I bought this only to get The Lady Eve movie.  This 4 pack was cheaper than buying a single copy of The Lady Eve.,1435708800,,113,3.7083333333333335
8613826,5,B00FAOAI7G,"This is worth the price just for the lady Eve. I absolutely never get tired of watching it. Henry Fonda is a riot as a bumbling stumbling butthead, Charles Coburn is absolutely marvelous. I read somewhere he didn't even get a start in Hollywood until he was 60. He did work on Broadway though. What a character. And Barbara Stanwyck is one of the best actresses of her times. She is great at comedy and as Eve she shows just how funny she can be.
She then goes all the way to the other side in Double Indemnity. With Fred MacMurray who she wraps around her finger to do her dirty work it becomes a waiting game of will they get away it.
It was the first time I saw All I desire. It was alright. If you're in the mood for a movie where all ends well, this is it.
There's always Tomorrow is one where I want to take a bat to Fred MacMurray's whole family. Especially his wife. Talk about neglect. Usually it's the wife begging.",1434153600,,925,4.173184357541899
