905982,4,6304642946,"Filmed at New York's Improv in 1971, we see a young Pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous. More polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album ""Craps After Hours."" However, witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother's prostitution, then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said. This scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come.",992304000,17,505,4.56043956043956

Also marred somewhat by  Pryor's nervousness, which manifests itself in too many moments of utter  silence.",939772800,4,382,4.5588235294117645

With the power of his personality Pryor defines and redefines his sense of humor  through brutal honesty and unrestrained commentary. ""Live and  Smokin"" is life on the edge!!! And if you are not careful you may fall  off the cliff in this wild excursion of laughter and mayhem!!! Fasten your  seatbelts, and don't forget to duck!!!",935712000,,464,4.8354430379746836

908057,4,6304642946,"I discovered both Richard Pryor and George Carlin when they were co-hosting a summer variety show on one of the big networks during  television's golden B&W period.  Both comedians impressed me as fresh, extremely talented and funny.  And if you view the G rated requirements of prime-time network TV not as a prohibition but as a ""challenging format"" requiring performers of inventive comic brilliance, both Pryor and Carlin proved they did not need ""forbidden"" words or ""blue"" humor to be funny.

Pryor works with color and race as his medium of expression much as Carlin does the same with language--more specifically, the distorted versions of reality we unwittingly create with our thoughtless uses of words.  Carlin, in some respects, has to be admired as the master of his craft precisely because he avoids autobiographical material and the construction of a comic persona based on his own life.  He's a comic everyman, reporting the day's trivial and sordid business, from flying on airplanes to being witness to another senseless war predictably launched by the all-supreme DOD.  He candidly discusses his hatred of ""lies,"" which is the only thing we can expect to hear from our government.  And then he proceeds to dramatize the world of lies to which each of us is subjected during our brief, uninformed  lifetimes.

If you can overlook the ""F word"" (hasn't it exhausted its meaning and effect by now?) and recognize, even in some of his most outrageously funny sketches (with catalogs of euphonic words, each individually clear yet coming together in a forceful current that streams from his mouth in a heady rush that I have yet to hear matched by any rapper-hip-hopper--if you can recognize in that stream not only the dazzling performance of a master craftsman but the picture of life as it is lived (or, more often, wasted), then you're in a position to recognize Carlin for the supreme satirist that he is.  Like the 18th century's Jonathan Swift, he's capable of touching a nerve provoking anger along with laughter (some of it anger over our own obtuseness and stupidity).

Both Carlin and Pryor are proficient at using multi-voices.  There's always the ""adult voice"" of arrogance, pride, and presumed maturity alternating with the more direct and vernacular voice of outrage and truth.

Pryor's builiding blocks are his personal experiences as a young black man having daily business with hookers, druggies, and brothels.  Unlike Carlin, he gives himself an advantage through his creation of a sympathetic figure due to the prejudice and hardships of his youth (most of the laughter heard on ""Live and Smokin'"" sounds like it's coming from the white women in a small audience).  Like Carlin, he works with loosely drawn-up ""set pieces,"" each of which has been carefully rehearsed before stringing them together for the occasion.  The transitions and segues aren't as smooth as Carlin's (there are a number of fades to black), and  Pryor occasionally makes self-conscious references to the challenge of working in front of a camera.  The audience gives him that--at least, more readily than if it were Carlin making similar excuses.  Much of the humor on ""Live & Smokin'"" is scatological--and here his targets are not black and white but man and woman, and the different ways in which each deals with his or her bodily functions.  It may strike the viewer as odd that the audience seems most repulsed when Pryor sticks his finger in his nose, then his mouth, then says: ""Come on, admit it .  Doesn't everyone enjoy a good booger?""  Maybe so, but that's the stuff that children between the ages of 5 and 8 especially enjoy (the ""Jelly-Belly Factory"" in Kenosha, Wi, even puts out a ""booger-flavored"" jelly bean).

Besides the ""shock value"" (getting the crowd's attention), the bits about body functions universalizes the primarily black life that is Pryor's main focus.  Soon he's not merely talking about but assuming the character of the real down-n-outers that, we quickly sense, he knows far better than we.  We may laugh but not without feeling equal amounts of pity and fear--one moment Pryor is swinging wildly with his fists, striking the mic or anyone within range, the next he's threatening to drop his trousers, the next he's a hopeless addict whose mother has called him a dog and whose father has disowned him for hocking the family TV set.  He uses his hand as an object of menace, helplessness and obscenity--holding it in the region of his groin and making it appear physically deformed.  Soon it becomes a symbol of his stolen manhood, signifying his limited opportunities and his resentment at a world that has kicked him into the gutter, then ignored him--no good Samaritans within sight of his tortured body, as he wishes for only two things: 1. a friend who will walk alongside of him, offering support and empathy until 2. two o'clock the next day, when he thinks he has a chance to score with drug-dealer who will make his troubles go away--for a limited time.

Pryor isn't saying , merely, that ""Black lives matter"" even though he's representing black experience with greater candor than many people (including successful and wealthy black people) have ever had a chance to get so close to.  It's only when his spectators sees through the ""blackness"" (Pryor's tool, his means to a weightier end) to the ""human"" and the universal that his humor reaches the destination that counts.  Black lives matter because, like white lives, they can easily be misled, misguided, mishandled and fall off the high and dry curb into a dark stagnating abyss--white lives and black lives alike. Whether it's an impoverished, unbathed, stinking white person or a black person, what matters is laughter signifying that we recognize in the afflicted humanity created by Pryor someone like ourselves.  Our pride and privilege can't insulate us from the fallen or excuse us from our failure to assist such a human being, even if it's to get him through another night of hell prior to the next fix.

It's not that black lives matter ""as much as"" white lives (the misunderstanding of white politicians).  Rather it's the recognition that if black lives don't matter, neither do white lives because we're all essentially alike.  If we allow blackness to distance ourselves from another human being--whether it's to abuse that person or to ignore him--we act as though black lives DON'T matter.  What you have yet to learn is that ""blackness is humanness.""

(Part of Pryor's closing impersonation of a down-and-out black man is theological, as he invokes the preacher and the Good Samaritan.  And these reference allow us to appreciate the power of humor to ""free us from our sins,"" lifted from us by the power of laughter.  Frankly, I enjoyed this performance more than the more celebrated ""Live on Sunset Strip.""  By the time of ""Sunset Strip"" Pryor had become a celebrity, and when every word that he speaks (some unintelligible) is greeted by laughter by an audience primed to respond in exactly that way, the ""cleansing action"" of great ""serious humor"" has been reduced to a meaningless ""ritual.""",1440288000,2,7116,4.967116357504215

Like the time he just blurred out,  ""anybody have a request?""  You can see him scrambling trying to get it back, sometimes he makes it work, while other times not so much.  When you look at the whole set, there are a few laughs but much of it is not that funny. At the time it was probably really cutting edge, but now it's really pass observational humor such as ""black people do this, white people do that.""  So, is it worth watching?  Considering what he went on to do, you see the raw, exposed Richard and that makes it interesting. Also in the historical context it's eye opening to see what little progress has been made in the racial divide. We are over forty years later, a much of what he said rings true today. Richard would see the whole ""hands up, don't shoot"" and he'd say, ""I told you so, n*****s."" And he uses that word, a lot.

The last bit with the wino is clearly the highlight. It is not comedy, it is more of a dramatic monologue, and it's an unfiltered look at the experience of black Americans that few white Americans know anything about. Especially in 1971.  This makes it worth watching even though there are few laughs in the routine.  If you're hoping for Sunset or his other classics, you'll be disappointed. But if you want to see just how hard it is to make people laugh, if you want to know how much effort it takes to put together a killer set, and if you want to see Richard at his rawest, watch this film.",1423699200,6,1594,4.254966887417218

The footage is ugly and between the low sound quality and Pryor's occasional incoherent rambling, thank heaven for subtitles.  This DVD is of interest to diehard Richard Pryor fans only.  It is amazing that he could take this seemingly terrible act and somehow refine it and polish it to grow into the star that we love.  To casual comedy fans Pryor says after the credits, ""I guess the [show] wasn't as funny as we hoped.""  Heed his warning and check out his other shows.",1187481600,4,798,4.455172413793103
911674,3,6304642946,"Live & Smokin' does contain some funny material but this was one of Richard's first video recordings (if not the first) and he was very nervous. He was also recording in front of the wrong audience. They barely laughed at some really funny stuff. It is at times uncomfortable to watch because you find yourself feeling embarrassed for him. He wants to do well but the audience doesn't cut him any slack. It sounds like the audience is eating (you can hear silverware clashing in the background) and they weren't giving him their undivided attention. This video was shot in the wrong place. It should have been filmed in Atlanta or Detroit. I believe the response from the audience would have been better.

This is Richard Pryor in his embryonic stage. He was performing for the audience instead of performing for himself. If this video had been filmed years later, after his act had been polished, he probably wouldn't have given a flip about the audience being a drag. He would have just done his thing. Bless his heart, he was so nervous. At one point, he even asked the audience to pretend that the cameras weren't there. And if you watch it through the ending credits he even says himself, ""This ain't as funny as we thought it was gonna be."" You just want to go through the TV and hug him. The material was funny, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I give it 3 stars because of the film's location and because of the horrible ending. The editor just cut him off in the middle of a wino routine. If you are a die-hard Richard Pryor fan (like myself), I would recommend this video. But if you just want to see some good-old fashioned Richie Pry at his best, polished and all, ""Live In Concert,"" or ""Live on The Sunset Strip"" may be a better choice for you.",1165017600,9,1775,4.441717791411043

But here enshrined forever is a 1971 concert of a slightly nervous, possibly high possibly in an attempt to kill the nervousness (not that that should be an excuse) Richard Pryor trying out his then-untested material that he worked diligently to develop the previous year in Berkeley, CA when he left his Cosby-copying, highly paid jive career.  This film shows him trying to find his true comedic voice.  One last thing--Pryor was unafraid to 'close a room' (I believe that's the term) I think it means to not be afraid to go there; to make members of an audience walk out midway through the performance.  Pryor was fearless and it showed in his later work.  He had to push it.  He wouldn't be Richard Pryor if he didn't.",1159056000,4,1097,4.445
911676,5,6304642946,"There is a long sequence where Pryor plays two roles: one of a wino and one of a junkie.  It starts off very funny, but then Pryor gets deep into the psyches of these damaged people, and it is heartbreaking.  The piece turns into a brilliant piece of theater.  Yes, there are more misses than hits in this 1971 performance, but there is no mistaking what a genius Pryor is.",1130457600,5,373,4.3

I had seen other stuff by Pryor I always liked but this time I never once really laughed out loud. It was dissapointing, good thing he has so many other good stuff",1130457600,2,291,4.290909090909091
911678,5,6304642946,"Live & Smokin was filmed in New York City, 1971. What you will see is Richard Pryor in a very unpolished act. You will clearly see that Pryor's delivery and professional timing were still in the developmental stage. Add to that he was strung out on cocaine when he did the performance. He told his audience he liked cocaine and the audience knew it. Most people who have seen this video did not like it too much, but they failed to see the value of what Pryor was able to accomplish what others tried to do. I give very, very high accolades to Lenny Bruce, he was one of the best. He went down the same road as Pryor, but he couldn't make it stick like Pryor did (also not many people saw or heard Bruce's material). Pryor was really able to talk about his misgivings and his troubled childhood. He had the ability to cover subjects that were very taboo at the time, from sexuality to racism. Racism itself is a tough subject to cover. Pryor showed the world with a in your face style of what was going on in the black community and how it related to the white community. Live & Smokin, although not that funny was a ground breaking event. Here Pryor laid the groundwork for what was to be the future of stand-up comedy. The film is very dark and primitive, but Pryor in his cocaine induced state, still managed to talk about his subject matter in a way that had you looking for more. When you watch it you may not like the comedy too much, but you will watch it to the end. The film was more of a documentay about Pryor talking of the state of affairs between all the different communities, Black, White, Hispanic or whatever. Live & Smokin is historic in the fact of what it was, a peek into the future of the subject matter of stand-up comedy. He opened the door for so many performers of all races. His ability to make us laugh at reality and social truth is uncanny. When you watch this film, don't look for the slap-happy drop dead laughs that you get from later Pryor films. You have to see this film for what it was, a historic comedic event for the time it was made. You must see it as a whole complete coverage of the sign of that time (1971) and a glaring glimpse into the future of comedy. All the modern comedians, George Carlin included had to switch to the Pryor type of subject matter, or you wouldn't make it as comedian. Pryor set the stage for the future, if your routine did not include sex or racisim you would not make in that business. The only other comedian that did not have to switch, again was Lenny Bruce. The Big difference you will see is how Pryor delivered his jokes. You must see ""In Concert"", ""Live on Sunset Strip"" or ""Here and Now"" to see Pryor in full bloom. Even in those films you could see that Pryor still could have ventured to even more taboo subjects. Look at Live & Smokin as a time piece. Throughout his career Pryor always maintained his subject matter, he always stayed black and always told white audiences what was happening in the black community, and whites wanted to listen. Live & Smokin was Pieced together and the production looks like a home movie, which is what it was, a home movie that was pulled from the vaults and made into a video. This video showed the true darkness of Pryor's life and we should applaud him for sharing it with us. Pryor made great strides since Live & Smokin, but this film is only the beginning, a look at what was to come. Another thing watchers that didn't like this film did't see was the slew of no-name characters that prior used to deliver his punchlines. These characters were part of the evolution of the Hip-Hop culture or way of being black on the streets of America. Pryor always made sure that portrayed black reality. In Live & Smokin he reveals to whites, the black world of gambling, prostitution, poverty and sex (even homosexuality), dealing with whites, police, hispanics, pushers and drug users. To Like or even love this movie (as older people from that time do) you have to know what was going on in the background of this film, what was happening on the streets in black and white America. How whites viewed blacks or even how everybody viewed everybody. No one in comedy history was able to make us laugh at ourselves, social reality and the truth like Richard Pryor.",1123977600,,4276,4.400252525252525
911679,5,6304642946,"I understand why people prefer videos like Live at the Sunset Strip, but what those people fail to see is that this is one of the rawest, most heart-wrenching stand-up performances ever put on film.

From start to finish, Pryor is laying himself bare--I'd give this video four stars for his boldness alone--being completely honest and in the moment, without a care as to whether the audience is ""with"" him or not.  Several times they clearly are not--you can sense the tension in the room when he chastises a walk-out and admits to having homosexual experiences.

It is the monologue where Pryor transforms himself into ""Willy the Junkie,"" however, that makes this video a must for anyone interested in the art of stand-up comedy.  It's a masterpiece of audience manipulation--at first, it seems like a harmless, amusing caracature, but soon it morphs into a horrifyingly honest portrayl.  I dare anyone to watch this and not have a strong reaction of some sort (it had me in tears).  Granted, it isn't funny (who says stand-up has to be funny at all times?), but it shows what Pryor was best at: exploring the area that most people spend their whole lives trying to avoid--The Rock Bottom.",1091836800,46,1190,4.8088235294117645
911680,3,6304642946,"I wanted to enjoy this video so bad (especially since I had purchased my copy instead of renting it). So far I've seen Live on the Sunset Strip, which was probably the funniest and best, and Richard Pryor Live in Concert, which was really close.
I gave this 3 stars because it had 3 good laughs, but I was hoping there would be more. It's only about 45 minutes long, which I was kind of disapointed about at first, then about half an hour in, I caught myself thinking, ""oh good, past the halfway mark."" With his other performances, I wanted them to go on and on and was sad they were over. This is fairly early standup from 1971. It appears to have been filmed at a supper club, not that the audience is shown at all, but because I could hear silverware clinking against plates in the background. Some of the material goes past raunchy and into gross-out, or at least gross enough that I felt bad for the people in the club who were eating while watching.
Pryor does do some funny material, especially comparing how white people do stuff (have dinner, have sex, etc)with how black people do it. I know Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy have done this topic over and over, but let's face it, Pryor did it first. Rock and Murphy both freely admit that he was their idol and the reason they wanted to do stand up, and since I've seen almost all the Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy standup there is, it's funny to see Pryor doing a routine that they both have obviously been inspired by.  I am sorry to say that Pryor was seriously under the influence of coke when they filmed this; it would have just been a guess but Pryor  very openly and bluntly says how much he loves cocaine, can't get enough of it, and can't stop doing it at the beginning of the video. He also seems much more wired than usual. This is fine, but it gets to the point of affecting his performance (several times he nervously adlibs asides that make no sense).
One thing that was poignant that another review I read mentioned was that Pryor jokes about his hellish childhood,  blurting out that his mother turned tricks while he was home. He sort of hangs his head quietly and smokes after he says it (it's even more uncomfortable because there's this kind of awkward silence in the club when he talks about it) and it's obvious he still is very sad about it. The production values aren't that great. They have to keep fading in and out, jumping ahead in the performance, probably because he went on one of his drug-induced tangents. Then it has a really abrupt ending, Pryor is doing his wino routine, which is pretty funny, and it seems like he's practically in the middle of a sentence when they freeze it and go to the credits. I could almost hear the editors saying, 'I think I'll end the movie riiight...HERE!"" (end).
Pryor is very talented, and I'm not saying that the video doesn't have its moments. It's just that I've seen so much better from this brilliant, hilarious guy. I would just recommend that if you haven't seen any filmed/videotaped performances, don't pick this one to start, try one of the ones I mentioned at the beginning of the review.",994636800,56,3120,4.441535776614311

7875460,5,6304642946,"Richard Pryor has no comedic rivals, mainly because of his honesty. He does have a rival in music, the incomparable, Adele, who like Pryor come to the stage only with a remarkable voice and the truth.

Too bad Rich flamed out so soon. But then where else was there to go for him? Did we really want to see him grow old, doing ""Mudbones"" on the chittling circuit and then becoming a greeter at Ceasar's? I don't think so. This album puts the genius of Pryor on full display, perhaps for the final time.

No one seems to understand that during his heyday, the US was (and still remains) a nation that does not like to hear the truth about itself. It's deep layer of denial (or lies about itself) grows without bounds, and is the only thing that makes it feel real, lies and denials is what makes life worth living in the US. (Now ain't that a bit*h?)

Remove that cover of sensitive skin (which literally is all there is to America, scorchingly sensitive white skin in fact) and there is nothing left. America culture is a skin deep ""boil"" that Richard Pryor lanced, and allowed just a little bit of the racial pus to run out, before the boil closed up on itself again.

Now with Bush and Obama, the boil needs lancing again, but there is no one left to tell America the truth about itself. We wallow in our Exceptionalism as the boil grows: Where is Richard Pryor when we need him? Five stars",1470528000,,1391,4.359073359073359
