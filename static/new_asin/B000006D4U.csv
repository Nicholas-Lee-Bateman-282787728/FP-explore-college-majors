7904038,5,B000006D4U,"I found out about this film from a woman I know who mentioned it in a conversation, and who told me that she only had watched the first ten minutes because she rented it by mistake. In another conversation she mentioned a scene that's late in the movie... Oh well, I don't really blame her.

I'm not giving this a high rating because all the sex turns me on in that way, because if I want porno, I don't need a story. With this film my reaction is more like ""Oh my god, this is just absolutely weird!"", rather like my reaction to a Stuart Gordon film or something by Ted V. Mikels. The thing about this film is that its creators were able to use the advantages inherent to the anime medium in a way that enhances how bizarre the film is.

If you're looking to get turned on by this film, go for it, though I see that as sort of a waste. But if you enjoy the feeling of ""Ooooh, they actually DID THAT!"" this is the film for you.

I'm going to get the sequels; I'd like to see how the whole thing turns out.",1305417600,4,1005,4.040201005025126
7904039,4,B000006D4U,"No, this movie is not for children.  Yes, it is perverted, demented, and an overall delight to behold.  If your are squeamish or humorless, this movie is not for you.  However, if you want to kick back with several  friends seeking to be fascinated by the rampant id of another, this is want  you're looking for.",949363200,2,312,4.5
7904040,4,B000006D4U,"Let's be honest.  Anyone who watches this movie, does so for the sexual content, not the fighting arts. This is the first anime I've watched with such sexual content.  If that's what you're looking for, it delivers.  The  detail, music soundtrack and characters all flow in perfect harmony.  I was  however disappointed in the fact that the fighting scenes were drastically  few and weak.  That is why I only gave it a 4 star rating.  I also didn't  care much for the English dubbing.  Over all though, I recommend it, if you  know what to expect.",949276800,8,547,4.583333333333333
7904041,4,B000006D4U,"I really love this movie. (But don't take my word for it, I love almost all anime movies.) Anyway, this movie might be a bit too much for the  younger viewers (as mentioned in every other review I read for this movie).  It's pornorific! I can take pretty much any intestinal abuse, but some of  the demon+girl scenes in this movie actually made me a bit queasy. Also the  action in this movie is as you can expect from pretty much any scifi anime  movie, hard and fast. Fountains of blood, bodies being blown apart (while  still copulating, mind you), but some cool stunts. If you like matrix type  action (with more blood), or if you like hentai, or anime in general, then  you should catch this flick. Just bring a barf bag, and don't bring granny  and your 7 nieces and nephews.",947635200,,781,4.405594405594406
7904042,5,B000006D4U,"I have been told and told by a very good friend of mine that I should see this, so I ordered it(yes I trust him completely) we both (being two time zones apart) popped it in at the same time and watched together from the  comforting glow of the computer monitor (romantic... I know)The plot was  just Wow! with just enough comedy, excellent animation, the violence was a  bit much for me but well worth it (yes the kids were definitely in bed)  Best movie I've seen yet, anime or otherwise.",947548800,3,490,4.351648351648351
7904043,5,B000006D4U,"Legend of the Overfiend just plain ol' kicks bootie! If your easily offended or squeamish, I REALLY wouldn't watch this. But if you like anime, and don't mind a little nudity, brutality, or destruction, look no further.  This movie blew my mind, the graphics and story line are excellent. If you  like Akira, your going to love this! I read other peoples reviews of this  movie and bought it, and am glad I did. You won't be dissapointed! :)",945216000,,441,4.556962025316456
7904044,1,B000006D4U,"This film ruined anime's image  The animation is substandard, the plot is fatuous, the characters are inane, and having to sit through endless boring, insipid  scenes of tentacle copulation is about as pleasant as antibiotic-resistant  tuberculosis. I'm not offended by it morally; it just seems to be made by  and for wankers. I don't mind sex, violence, blood, guts, and profanity,  but Legend of the Overfiend brings the transgression of acute vapidity to a  level that has never before been seen. Oh, and here's a shocker: Tokyo is  destroyed. Which of course is a plot twist drenched in originality.  ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN?  Everyone else, enjoy. It doesn't get any worse than this.",929664000,6,693,5.061946902654867
