7578798,3,B019PHHVSW,"It comes from a fuzzy era of both horror movies and comedies from 1993, when the transition from the familiar 80's stuff was just getting started, and such movies had yet to settle into their new wave of slacker humor like CLERKS and self-referential slasher films like Wes Craven's SCREAM.  It is a fairly innocuous film, and almost completely bloodless for a zombie story... and while it isn't exactly HILARIOUS, there are enough genuinely funny parts & quirky dialogue throughout to make it worth watching more than once, maybe.  I got my copy for $5 at a local big box store (you know who) who stocked it on an endcap a couple days before the 3-15-2016 release date advertised on here.  Worthwhile impulse buy.

MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK is the ""tragic"" story of Johnny Dingle, an upbeat high school dweeb who really just wants to take a super hot girl to the prom; he's been in love with Missi since kindergarten (and I don't blame him), but of course she ends up dating the local jock/jerk instead.  Johnny and his pal Eddie hastily hatch a dumb scheme in which Johnny will pretend to risk his life during a phony robbery to save Missi, thereby impressing her and scoring a date.  Of course THAT doesn't go quite right, and Johnny ends up ACTUALLY giving his life. Oops.

This is all in about the first ten minutes.  If nothing else, this is a briskly paced comedy that doesn't waste much time getting to the point.  With almost no fanfare at all, Johnny comes crawling out of the grave and, to no one's real shock, goes right back to his ""life"" as a high school kid dealing with oddball parents and assorted bullies at school, who don't take kindly to their recently deceased peer.

There is nothing particularly uproarious or OVERLY funny about this set-up, and it is definitely a lesser (if maybe a bit ahead of its time) foray into the ""rom-zom-com"" subgenre, which would later be popularized and better executed by films like SHAUN OF THE DEAD or FIDO.  MBF'sB relies mostly on the silly idea that no one seems very surprised that a dead Johnny is now walking around as if nothing had happened; the BEST thing MBF'sB has going for it is the occasionally charming, weird dialogue that arises from its patently absurd premise.  Decent performances by Bernard Herrmann as dad, and the brilliant character actor Austin Pendleton as a crackpot doctor, are bonuses, as well as little itty-bitty appearances by the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Matthew McConaughey... like I mentioned, there is just about NO gore whatsoever save for a splash or smear of blood once or twice, and all the ""violence"" and implied cannibalism is played for chuckles.  It's a tame PG-13 product, & there are some gross-out moments that involve Johnny's waxy, decaying body parts falling off.  If you are the kind of person who is inclined to think too much about these things, the underlying idea that a girl could fall in love with the reanimated corpse of a classmate and start making out with him is a little... um, off-putting.  But overall, it's a simple & breezy romantic comedy with a faintly macabre backdrop, and it doesn't require too much of the viewer.

The blu-ray pic quality is fine, and the sound is OK, and honestly, that's probably all you need to know -  it's a competent Mill Creek effort, & this isn't exactly the sort of film that demands a high degree of technical appreciation, anyway; there are no extras or special features on this release.  If you have fond video rental memories of this one from when it was originally released, it's worth having... and if not, well, you probably wouldn't miss it very much anyway.",1457827200,7,3623,4.687697160883281

7578805,5,B019PHHVSW,"I believe this came out in 1993. Teen Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowry) is the shy nerd kid who loves the pretty girl (Traci Lind) and it is from afar and he wants to go to the prom with her. The problem he ends up dead and is determined to still go with her. So, he comes back from the dead. Now let me tell you how much fun and how funny this movie really was, I laughed out loud so many times. Andrew and Traci are terrific (I will have to see if they have done more, since) the cast is a virtual who's who now....matthew Fox, Matthew McConaughey, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Hermann and Mary beth Hurt are outstanding as ""deadboy's"" parents. And Cloris Leachmen. If you want a genuine good time and some genuine laughs......here is a movie for you....highly recommended.",1461369600,7,772,4.405594405594406
7578806,4,B019PHHVSW,"This bare-bones Blu-ray is like the DVD in that it has no extra features, not even a trailer or previews. The picture quality is good, though, and the movie is silly fun. My Boyfriend's Back is an underrated romantic-horror-comedy that seems like an '80s movie even though it was made in the '90s. Its zany sense of humor reminds me a bit of Better Off Dead.",1460332800,3,358,4.4393939393939394

8745692,5,B019PHHVSW,This movie is from my childhood and couldn't wait to watch it again. I couldn't find this movie anywhere else. Glad it was a good price and not over priced for something many people have probably not even seen.,1512518400,,210,4.410256410256411
8745693,5,B019PHHVSW,"Johnny Dingo (Andrew Lowery) loved little Missy (Traci Lind) with a love that would not die. His only wish was to take her to the prom. His scheme to get here to go with him goes awry. Johnny finds himself six foot underground. That night he RETURNS.

We find love, loyalty, and ground Chuck on the menu. This movie is right up there with the best zombie movies such as ""Weekend at Bernie's II.""

Notice how his parents are very supportive though out the story. And there is an appropriate lesson near the end.",1500681600,,510,4.414893617021277

8745699,3,B019PHHVSW,"The Blu Ray is fine, no complaints so I give it a 3 because it is a product and not a film review but I had to subtract one star for the film itself, and I should only be subtracting that star from myself because I saw this film as a child and liked it.  The reason I bought it now was because I not only romanticized about that viewing as a child (a common mistake) but because I'm a massive Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan and set out to own all of his movies, with as few exceptions as possible.  Well, younger me was not too bright, and while I love a bad movie as much as the next guy, this one is just bad bad, not it's so bad it's funny bad.  3 stars because yes it is in my permanent collection, but if you have not seen it before and are lured in by the big names (Mathew McConeghey as well) who are nothing more than cameos, then rent it first, please.",1471824000,,858,3.9195402298850577
