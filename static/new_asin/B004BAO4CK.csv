8421827,5,B004BAO4CK,"GRAPEVINE VIDEO has presented a very nice print from 35mm of one of Wally Wales (later bad-guy Hal Taliaferro) silent Westerns. Nice location shooting, good story & characters. If you'd like to see an excellent low-budget silent (w/musical score) Western, color tints and all, then this is the one! VERY enjoyable! Recommended.",1345075200,,327,5.3076923076923075
