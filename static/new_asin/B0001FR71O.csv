Personally, I never forgot it and always wanted to see it again. Fire up YouTube.... Sure it's silly now that I'm, well, worldly-wise and jaded and bitter and critical; and not exactly in elementary school anymore; and a fine film aficionado. But it'll do.
We loved the little boy that the crooks used to train and care for the dogs because he really took care of the dogs, he outsmarted the guys using him and he and all the little doggies got away safe in the end. Good stuff. If you're 10. If you're not then watch something else and keep your cranky old crusty opinions to yourself, ya old warthog.",1483315200,,725,4.299270072992701

8011731,1,B0001FR71O,"The last of The Doberman Gang saga, is as boring and absurd as the first two are silly but entertaining and fun two watch on a sunday with large pop corn on your tv room sofa. The fun in this unprentencious films, are the dogs and the silly yet, coherent heist plots, but in The Daring Dobermans, all that is left out in order to pursue a stupid love story between a redeemed midle age gambler and a midle age horse tamer, the Circus where she belongs to becomes the main theme and we barely see the dobermans, and when we finally do see them, is as a ridiculous circus atraction. A really sad way to end the trilogy.",1247702400,,617,4.19327731092437
