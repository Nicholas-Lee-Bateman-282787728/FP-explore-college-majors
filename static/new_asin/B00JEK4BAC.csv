8650278,2,B00JEK4BAC,"Our dvd did not play well.it stopped and skipped. What we did see showed a dance group very inferior to late 20th and 21st century NYCB. There is no precision in the steps, no energy in the performances. This hurts me to say because I love Balanchine and the NYCB .",1451952000,2,265,4.215686274509804
8650279,4,B00JEK4BAC,"I took off a star because I'm not crazy about Balanchine's more avant garde ballets.  I bought this specifically to see Serenade with the dancers I grew up watching at City Center, then at Lincoln Center.  The video quality is excellent, especially when you consider that the original filming was done in 1957 or so.  It is black and white or slightly sepia toned, but that does not detract.  The camera work is quite good.

The few interviews are in French with English subtitles.

Well worth adding to your library and if you like Orpheus, add a star.",1423440000,10,553,4.591836734693878
