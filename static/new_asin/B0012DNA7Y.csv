8245124,5,B0012DNA7Y,The cardio and weights routine is fantastic!  Good African drums music and lovely outdoors location (park/rotunda).  Highly recommended!,1407715200,,136,6.5
8245125,5,B0012DNA7Y,I have been collecting and working out consistently with videos for over 10 years and couldn't believe how wonderful the Cardio and Weights routine on this dvd was.  The moves were easy to follow and fun.  The music delightful.  Definitely soared to the top of my collection.  Too bad most exercisers will never even hear about this workout let alone have the joy of doing it.,1261526400,15,376,4.651515151515151
8245126,4,B0012DNA7Y,"""Strength and Spirit"" is divided into four main segments. The workouts were filmed at Harkness State Park so it makes them more relaxing. In the first segment the instructor teaches the importance of conscious breathing. This is a warm-up that includes foreword bends, moving chair, moving lunges, plank, push-ups and downward dog.

The second segment consists of a cardio workout with weights. Both the upper body and the lower body are worked out at the same time. There are step touches, kicks, squats, side leg lifts and shoulder rolls.

The third segment is an upper body workout with weights and a core workout that includes sit-ups and bridge. While the first three workouts are enhanced by African drums, the final segment is more relaxing and includes flute music. This segment consists of more yoga postures including mountain pose, sun breaths, foreword bends, cat/cow, plank pose, cobra, bridge, spinal twists and corpse pose.

By the time you complete this entire workout you will feel like you worked out your entire body and yet you will feel relaxed and invigorated. I'd recommend this to beginners (there are lots of modifications) and intermediate (there are some good balance challenges) practitioners. The yoga moves are not overly complex so they are perfect for beginners.

But not with Anita's workout. This workout will leave you feeling  not only refreshed and renewed but stronger and more centered as well, and in only 60 minutes.
