8041653,4,B0006IIOF4,"Goldfish Memory follows a group of Irish 30 something's as they navigate love, lust and loss through the streets of Dublin. When reporter Angie (Flora Montgomery) meets Clara (Fiona Glascott), at a St. Patrick's Day protest, her interest is peaked.

Clara who hasn't the best luck with men, easily slides into an affair with Angie but doesn't want commitment. Angie however, is looking for more than just an affair; she wants a relationship and kids. Angie's gay best friend Red (Keith McErlean) is on his own search, but not for commitment.

Writer/director Liz Gill has created a marvelously thought-provoking look at the complexities involved in straight, gay, lesbian and bisexual relationships and love in contemporary Dublin. Witty writing makes Goldfish Memory a hidden gem of a film.

Flora Montgomery is wonderful as sexy reporter Angie, on the look out for elusive true love while moving through a variety of relationships. Keith McErlean is equally great as Red, caught up in his own romantic expectations while supporting best friend Angie on her path to happiness.

8041655,4,B0006IIOF4,"Goldfish Memory is a story about figuring out our conceptions of love -- What sex are we attracted to? Who do we want to date? Are we looking for a one night stand, a short-term relationship, marriage.....? Why, if we've done this so many times before, DO WE NEVER LEARN!? Goldfish Memory is a light-hearted flick, maintaining a humorous and entertaining tone throughout, yet it deals with seriously realistic issues in the world of

dating that we all face. And, no matter what your sex or sexual preference is, there are definitely a few scenes between the sheets that will heat up the room.

The story is basically a big, messy, love and sex tangle inolving a group of 20- and 30-somethings in Dublin (oh those sexy Irish accents). The dating mayhem begins when Clara, a beautiful and secure woman, sees her boyfriend kissing another woman and wants to bolt. Conveniently enough, there's a fine dyke in town who has her eye on Clara, and the fun begins. Soon enough, Clara's not the only one stepping out of the dating safety zone. Everyone seems to have caught the exploratory fever, and everything

seems to be up in the air -- sexuality, monogamy, patience; and why it is that we continue to put ourselves into vulnerable love situations, and continue to be hurt, over and over again. Sound too predictable? Don't fear. The story has several unique spins that make this movie far more exciting than your typical confused love story. It also has an intelligently witty and entertaining ending that you will never see coming.

All in all, a very entertaining movie. No matter who you are, or what your love life is like, you will find something to relate to in this story. And while the acting is not the best I've ever seen, it's a dang good movie for what it is. PLUS, it includes a soundtrack with some great Irish indie hits. Well-worth it.",1136419200,9,1848,4.6422018348623855
8041656,3,B0006IIOF4,"I bought this because I like to give glbt movies I've never heard of a chance to speak for themselves. And this one didn't say much.

 The best part about the movie is that it's set in Dublin and comes with a free soundtrack. There wasn't much substance to the movie: a bunch of hook ups and break ups that recombined to form more hook ups and break ups. I was expecting something less shallow. People all over the world hook up/break up, but GOLDFISH didn't have anything new or different to say about it.

If you like movies like ""The Incredible Adventures of Two Girls in Love,"" then you will love this. If you have more of an intellectual taste (beyond the Rilke quotes), then move on to something else.",1124496000,10,707,4.3816793893129775
8041657,5,B0006IIOF4,"An absolutely delightful, original, funny, sexy,  and even thought provoking romantic comedy.  I loved every minute of it and found it neither bland nor boring, as one reviewer termed it.  I can see how  the straight-laced or conservative might be offended by the bed-hopping and orientation-blurring relationships, but this is not a movie made for them.  If you've got an open mind, this film is an unexpected treat!",1114992000,15,417,5.073529411764706

Goldfish Memory"" is a light-hearted look at the dangers and delights of dating in contemporary Dublin.  When Clara sees her boyfriend kissing Isolde, it sets off a chain reaction of romances and heartbreaks until the entire cycle has turned full-circle, with each character trying to solve the pressing question of what is the perfect relationship!  Some favor marriage, others a week-at-a-time arrangement.

The only thing they can all agree on is that love is the one thing we cannot live without.  Falling in love, out of love and making the same mistakes all over again - all of us say we learn from heartbreak, but how many of us really change?  And do we really want to?  Exploring the comical and romantic nature of love, straight, gay and in-between, ""Goldfish Memory"" brings to life the saying...what goes around...comes around...and around.....

Written & directed by Liz Gil, Goldfish Memory stars Sean Campion, Fiona O'Shaughnessy, Peter Gaynor, Flora Montgomery, Keith McErlean, Lise Hearns, Fiona Glascott & Jean Butler.",1100217600,5,1244,5.211055276381909
