7799897,5,1598031538,"I decided to listen to this course since this is the 100th Anniversary of WWI. I wanted to know more about this ""Great War"" that is so often overshadowed by WWII. The only two criticisms that I have is the lack of a chronology in the course and lack of an emphasis on the military history. The course is highly topical with lectures like: Air War, War at Sea, Propaganda War, Dissent and Its Limits, etc... All are well-researched and well-presented, but the lack of a clear chronology leaves some of these topics in a vacuum. I found myself on Wikipedia a few times being sure that I was not confusing some of the chronology. That being said, I understand why the professor decided to use a topical approach--it allowed him to tackle major issues in single comprehensive lectures rather than spreading those same issues throughout the course. The other thing missing from this course is a comprehensive discussion about the battles. The professor certainly mentions the major battles and provides some discussion, but this is far from a military history. The course is much more focused on the social and political issues than the military ones. If I was in charge of the Great Courses, I would expand this course by adding another six lectures--maybe two dedicated to a chronology and four emphasizing the military history.

While these are significant criticisms, I need to emphasize that I still consider this course excellent. While I believe the course would benefit from more chronology and more military history, these are mere omissions. The quality of the course content that is included is outstanding. The professor is clear and organized. The professor is interested in the topic and knowledgeable.

Since I was a history major in college and often read history books, I judge a history course by two factors: 1. Did I learn something? and 2. Do I understand the topic better? I can answer both of these in the affirmative after finishing this course. I learned much more than I previously did about the political fights throughout Europe that led up to the war and dominated military decisions. For instance, I found it fascinating that, at one point, German politicians were making strategic decisions about the conduct of the war with the next war clearly in mind--they wanted to be in a better position for the next time that Europe tore itself apart in bloody conflict. This certainly belays the myth that World War I was fought as the ""War to End All Wars."" The course did not make me an expert on the topic, but it gave me a better understanding and appreciation of the history of World War I.",1488412800,3,2613,4.791574279379158
7799898,5,1598031538,"I've been checking them out of the library, and I'm thrilled to be able to get my own copy at a much more reasonable price than The Great Courses charge! I love the way Liulevicius expresses himself and explains things very clearly but in an entertaining way. Anyone with an interest in WWI should get this set.",1459382400,5,311,4.473684210526316
