8542644,5,B009KU8VSY,They traveled the world getting this footage and collected a lot of vintage footage. A great soundtrack and great story. Many wonderful interviews. We are so lucky to have Jochen's talent put to this task. It is MILES better than you would ever imagine it would be.,1469750400,2,265,4.659574468085107
8542645,5,B009KU8VSY,"A most excellent compilation of the history and development of the ""TIKI"" genre that will fascinate all devotees!
There are clips and interviews with some of the luminaries of this almost entirely ""faked"" exotic escapism that took people away to their special island, without ever leaving home. Music, drinks, ""tikis"" (naturally!) and restaurants/bars are all covered.
The demise of Tiki is also covered as it was accused of being kitsch, ...but thankfully the DVD ends on the promising note of ""the Gods will return""!
I think we are already seeing that happy event as interest re-grows, home Tiki-bars are set up and all those wonderful items on eBay become more and more expensive.

 Beautifully packaged and presented, this is a treat that will have you itching to throw on your favourite Aloha shirt....(what do you mean you haven't got one?), go mix a Mai Tai in your personal Tiki-mug,  put Lyman, Denny and Baxter on random play and kick back dreaming of Bali H'ai !

The DVD is labelled Part 1, but as of writing this Part 2 has never eventuated...more's the pity!
Highly recommended for all lovers of all things Tiki!",1462579200,2,1126,4.848958333333333
8542646,5,B009KU8VSY,"A friend watched my copy, and now she sort of gets it. I don't seem quite as nuts to her now :-)
Me? I loved it. If you love Tiki, you won't want to miss this!",1434585600,3,159,3.4444444444444446
8542647,5,B009KU8VSY,Excellent! Great tale of the history of tiki!,1423094400,2,45,4.75
8542648,5,B009KU8VSY,"So, I am lucky to have a friend who has jumped right into the tiki culture. He has converted one of his front rooms into a beautiful home tiki bar. He collects tiki mugs, lots of them. He has been known to sample some of his own tiki mixology magic. In fact, he's even met some of the luminaries (at tiki events) of this film. Back in the day when we had the time for such talks, my friend would regale me with stories and other details about many things tiki. He came to his knowledge the old- fashioned way: he read books, he went to Oceanic Arts in Whittier, he attended Tiki Oasis and Tiki Caliente, he visited Tiki Central.com, he drank. And he shared so much with me. Now to learn about tiki history [those two words really shouldn't go together] and all that other tiki stuff do you really have to go to all that effort? No! Just watch The DVD of Tiki (vol. 1 - Paradise Lost). You'll have fun while you learn -  honest, kids.  Enjoy!",1407369600,4,941,4.193370165745856
8542649,5,B009KU8VSY,"This is a wonderful story about the History of Tiki in America. The DVD starts nice...It talks about the true Native Polynesian history. The DVD covers how the love of ""Tiki"" took hold in America. It answers the question about the true creator of the Mia Tia. It is a great Documentary on the History of Tiki in America. Narrated by King Kukulele.",1376524800,6,347,4.523809523809524
8542650,5,B009KU8VSY,"""The Most Exotic Chapter of American Pop Culture!""

There may be many things that come to mind when one hears the word ""tiki"" -- far-away tropical islands, exotic sculptures, fruit-laden cocktails or maybe just basement home bars and backyard luaus. Today, ""tiki"" has been firmly embedded within the American psyche and culture. Tiki influences and decor can be found everywhere from the local party supply store to some of the most refined restaurants and bars. The popular fascination with tiki has come and gone and come again. But what are it's roots?

This documentary explores the rich & intriguing history of the events, cultures, individuals and beautifully exotic locales that spurred the country's enchantment with (what we now simply call) ""tiki.""

This ""Part 1"" DVD takes the viewer through the beginnings of the escapism of Polynesian Pop, through the popular ""tiki boom"" as restaurants, music and our homes were overrun with exotic influences.

The film itself is beautifully shot & wonderfully edited. It's a deep, rich look into its subject that is as informative as it is entertaining. With diverse shooting locations that span the globe, it's easy to see how this film took years to make. This is a great film to own & repeatedly watch. There's something new to see with each viewing!
