5795726,5,B00DF6LMDK,What a ride!!!  Can't wait for next season!  Great acting and cast.  Know season 2 starts this month in Australia hope the DVDs are available in the fall/ winter,1398902400,6,161,4.482758620689655
5795727,5,B00DF6LMDK,"Love Orange is a New Black but this series doesn't compare.  This is more of a drama and not funny where as OIANB is comedy/drama in my opinion.
The acting is excellent and it keeps you wanting more. I would recommend watching this series. I was greatly surprised.",1451865600,,264,4.5
5795728,5,B00DF6LMDK,"One Sentence Can Change A Life.  That is the blurb that you find on the box for the first season and it is perfect for the show because being put on remand while awaiting trial for the attempted murder of her abusive husband sure changes the protagonist character; Bea Smith's life.  The first season is the story of how that life changes as she adapts to a life behind bars and the people who surround her some for good and some for ill.  This show has often been compared to the Netflix Original ""Orange Is the New Black"" and for good reason.  They have similar themes and a similar backdrop but while OITNB is a breezy comedy, Wentworth is a hard and dark drama.  OITNB is also filled with characters who are often victims of an unfair justice system while the characters on Wentworth, on both sides of the bars,  are perpetrators of their own downfall.  Two of the more likable inmates Doreen and Liz are in prison for pretty terrible crimes.  However Wentworth is by far a better written show.  By season 3 OITNB has lost its edge but Wentworth is still going strong.  I would highly....Highly recommend this show.",1447372800,,1119,4.522388059701493
5795729,5,B00DF6LMDK,"This series (originally titled just ""Wentworth"") is a remake of the 1970s series ""Prisoner: Cell Block H"" and from what I can see, it does stay pretty true to the original.  People are bound to compare it to Orange Is The New Black, but Wentworth is a pretty dark drama, while OITNB is a lighter comedy-drama, so I don't think you can really say that this is better or worse. I thought both were terrific. The acting in this show is excellent. Danielle Cormack as Bea, who killed her abusive husband, shows a very believable evolution from terrified-and-out-of-her-element  to drawing on hidden strength that she didn't know she had. At the end of the first season she shows a side of herself---maybe her NEW self--- that will surprise the viewer. The back-stories of the other inmates are interesting as well, particularly those of Liz (Celia Ireland) and Doreen (Shareena Clanton) both of whom made a terrible mess of their lives, did harm to others, and yet are still very sympathetic characters who do a lot of good for the other inmates. Some great performances also by Nicole da Silva as Franky, the young, tough alpha-dog on the block, and Kris McQuade as Jacs, the villain you'll love to hate.",1445212800,3,1201,4.741626794258373
5795730,5,B00DF6LMDK,Great series. I really enjoyed it and the characters are brilliant!,1437436800,,67,5.181818181818182
5795731,5,B00DF6LMDK,"Being that I am an Orange is the New Black fan, I really didn't want to like this show. That being said, this show is SO GOOD! It makes OITNB look like Sesame Street. I can't wait for the next season to come out on net flix! I'm watching it for the second time and it's just as good as it was the first time.",1436054400,3,308,3.753846153846154
5795732,5,B00DF6LMDK,"FORGET Orange is the new black which is so TAME compared with Wentworth, this is by far the BEST ""Prison"" SHOW (I cant say best show because of breaking bad and walking dead) but its TOTALLY UP THERE in the ranks. If you like Orange you WILL LOVE wentworth, its like orange but on CRACK. It's totally addictive and binge worthy. I can't say enough good things about this show but I PROMISE you won't be disappointed with it.",1435104000,7,424,4.379746835443038
5795733,5,B00DF6LMDK,"Stay with it . . . you will find yourself thinking about the characters in this show. Great acting and compelling characters. This is darker than OITNB and doesn't have it's over-the-top zaniness.  I cannot wait for season three. Wow.  I agree, even better than OITNB.",1425513600,2,268,4.804347826086956
5795734,5,B00DF6LMDK,Better than Orange Is The New Black.  I love this show.  Cannot wait for season 3 and season 4 was just announced.  Excellent series.,1425427200,,133,4.458333333333333
5795735,5,B00DF6LMDK,Love love love this show seen both seasons and waiting on season 3,1423180800,,66,4.153846153846154
5795736,5,B00DF6LMDK,"i watched season 1 and season 2 on netflix for free. i believe that ""orange is the new black was taken from this.
i can't wait for SEASON 3!!!!!!",1422057600,,145,4.0344827586206895
5795737,1,B00DF6LMDK,"No would not play on my DVD player, should have stated before purchased, not after.",1421539200,,83,4.6
5795738,1,B00DF6LMDK,It would not play in a DVD player tried 4 different ones. It's said its not in the region. And it's because it's from the uk.,1421107200,,125,3.8461538461538463
5795739,5,B00DF6LMDK,Excellent program. I stumbled upon this on a streaming service and was instantly hooked. In my opinion it is better than OITNB. The acting is fantastic and believable. Highly recommend!,1420502400,,185,5.2
5795740,5,B00DF6LMDK,"We just finished watching the 2 available seasons and can't wait for the new season in 2015.  This is one of the best written and acted series I've watched in a very long time.  We've also watched Orange is the New Black.....While good and dynamic, it's a little too playful at times.  Wentworth is more gritty and real.....The women who act in this series are incredibly talented!
Definitely worth watching.....I think you'll be counting the minutes until season 3 comes out too.",1419811200,3,480,4.829268292682927
5795741,5,B00DF6LMDK,"This is the best show I've seen since Breaking Bad, period. As the only one of my friends who finds Orange Is The New Black a bit too campy, it was awesome to find a prison show that's a bit more dark and gritty. So dark and gritty, in fact, that I found myself screaming at the screen in parts and crying in others. You're going to get hooked; enjoy the ride.",1419638400,,360,4.013888888888889
5795742,5,B00DF6LMDK,"Better than Orange is the new blacK! Love it. In fairness, 1st season is a little slow; but season 2 is very entertaining.",1418083200,,122,4.3478260869565215
5795743,5,B00DF6LMDK,"I prefer this so much more than Orange is the New Black, since OITNB seems to think that every female that goes to prison is a lesbian.  This is far superior as it does not focus on sex scenes, bu on actual storylines.

Bea is far more complex than we at first perceive her to be.

Seriously wonderful cast.",1417651200,,307,4.169491525423729
5795744,5,B00DF6LMDK,"This series is very addicting and the acting is excellent. They copy a few secondary characters from Orange is the New Black and it's not as good as HBO's OZ, but it's damn good enough! Just finished season 4, which is OUTSTANDING!",1416700800,2,231,4.523809523809524
5795745,4,B00DF6LMDK,Found this by accident and...WOW!  What amazing acting!,1416441600,2,55,5.875
5795746,5,B00DF6LMDK,I am hooked on this show! It is soo good! I wish there were more than 2 seasons out. Catch it on Netflix. :D,1416441600,,108,3.5416666666666665
8592760,4,B00DF6LMDK,Fast delivery.  The show is worth the price.  Can't wait for season 4 and 5 to come in us format.,1510790400,,97,3.8
8592761,2,B00DF6LMDK,Not all episodes in disc 2 and 3. Had to reorder separately,1507075200,,59,4.0
8592762,5,B00DF6LMDK,Great show! Better than Orange ITNB. I bought the wrong region but that's on me!,1484006400,,80,4.4
8592763,5,B00DF6LMDK,"After watching all seasons of Orange is the New Black, I decided to try Wentworth Prison.  I must say that I was not disappointed.  It is EVEN BETTER.  Season One was riveting and chilling.  I think it realistically portrays life in a women's prison.  Excellent writing and acting.  The actress who plays Jaqs, in my opinion, looks just like Martha Stewart and plays an evil, sinister character.  And...there are 4 seasons to watch!  Season 2, here I come!",1471737600,,456,4.756410256410256
8592764,5,B00DF6LMDK,"I absolutely love this series. Great acting from Nicole da Silva and Danielle Cormack.
Also great prison sets and writing. Supporting cast was also fantastic.",1467676800,,158,5.36
8592765,1,B00DF6LMDK,"I could not play it.  It must be from another country.  The DVD player says ""wrong region"".  Very disappointed.",1462752000,,111,4.7368421052631575
8592766,5,B00DF6LMDK,I Love this show.  I really wish they would bring this out for Region 1 DVD's.  I was addicted to Prisoner Cell Block H at first and was overly happy to find out Bea Smith was coming back.  Danielle Cormack does an exceptional job.  I cannot wait for the next season to come out.  This show has me glued to my computer and I finish a season in 2 days.,1459123200,,351,3.9571428571428573
8592767,5,B00DF6LMDK,Fabulous show!  Hated to see it end.  Watched on a streaming service so this is not a review of this particular DVD set.,1459036800,,120,4.173913043478261
8592768,1,B00DF6LMDK,Cannot even watch on regular DVD!,1456358400,,33,4.666666666666667
8592769,5,B00DF6LMDK,"Wentworth is the best  tv show ever... Orange is the new black, can't compare. It is so good and has the best stories. Omigosh! ! I binge watch season 3 and I can't  wait for season 4. This show is so amazing and the actors, I swear you connect with all of them. If you haven't seen the show, I promise you are missing out!!",1453334400,,324,3.9692307692307693
