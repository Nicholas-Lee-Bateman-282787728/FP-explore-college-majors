2892652,5,B000T28PLU,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It delved into the beginnings of the templar, and I thought did a good job. I wish they would have discussed the demise of the templar in more detail, but that was really all that was lacking.",1235088000,5,219,4.238095238095238
2892653,5,B000T28PLU,"A well done 100 minute replay of the History Channel 2 part series on the Templars.  This is relatively pure history, and doesn't have much in the way of strange or unsubstantiated theories - and to the extent it does, they are identified as such.  If you are looking for a balanced and generally accurate rendering of Templar history, watch this special.",1230336000,5,355,4.709677419354839

2892673,4,B000T28PLU,This is a documentary produced by the History channel on the historic Knights Templar. The focus is on the Crusades and their conviction as heretics. I thought it was a worthwhile purchase. Got it from a local Christian bookstore.,1409270400,,230,4.923076923076923

2892686,4,B000T28PLU,This was excellent but I did notice some facts were wrong.  At one point the narrator says Richard the Lionheart retook Jerusalem briefly in 1229.  Richard died in 1199.  Errors such as this cloud the rest.  But it is all presented so authoritatively you want to believe it anyway.  And I did--for the most part.,1403395200,2,312,4.6

2892691,3,B000T28PLU,"the name makes it sound like a mystery but the actual flick is not all that interesting.  This is one of three period selections from the history channel, all of which are just ok and not as good as most of their others.  This one is very average like the dark ages and the crusaders on the same period.",1386720000,,303,4.11864406779661
2892692,4,B000T28PLU,"Who were they?  This is the saga of the warrior/monks  Knights Templar or a la Poor Knights of Christ.  Known as the first standing army since the fall of the Roman Empire their power exceeded all combined kingdoms of the mid point of the Middle Age period.  The title of this History Channel creation refers to the banking system with cipher coding they used to provide Holy Land Pilgrims with financial security, the first credit cards.

I have been taken with this group for a very long time and have read many books and visited most all of the places in this film.  I found the video as a very well done historical account of the Knights story.  Edward Herrmann narrates the program in his usual outstanding voice coupled with at least six well known expert researchers of our time on this subject.  There are a few errors in the script (Richard the Lion-Heart takes back the Holy Land in 1227?) that the novice will not notice.  Otherwise, the story covers the first three crusades and then jumps to the end of the 13th century.  The story begins to ends with the arrest of the Knights Templar by Phillip the Fair (IV) of France on 13 October 1307, Friday The 13th.

The video provides speculation as to what ultimately happened to the order and even discusses the story of the Money Pit on Oak Island looking for their treasure in modern times.  If you would like a very good two hour history lesson on this enigmatic group, this is for you.",1383868800,4,1447,4.501915708812261
2892693,5,B000T28PLU,"The knights Templar are seriously misunderstood .......they were so successful they were the subjects of much jealousy , and this contributed to their downfall..........the church they sought to defend became their enemy........history will treat them far better......",1383264000,2,268,6.27027027027027
2892694,5,B000T28PLU,Good video but could use more accurate details instead maybe scenarios but hey we all need to learn about the past and what happened.,1379030400,,133,4.583333333333333

2892699,5,B000T28PLU,Interesting program by History Channel. So much has gone on during world history that it's just nuts. People have just gotten themselves into so much mess that we don't need to be surprised to see where we are today. Would recommend.,1357948800,,233,4.7073170731707314

2892703,4,B000T28PLU,"""Decoding the Past: The Templar Code (History Channel)"" is a narrated reproduction of myth and folklore surrounding the Knights Templar.  A few castle ruins, references to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, some actors portraying sword fight battles on foot and horseback, a little bit of speculation on the Holy Grail (what it is; where it is), some footage inside Rosslyn Chapel for codes found in architectural design emphasis, some reproduction and history of the legendary Money Pit on Oak Island, and other insignificant background history for the Knights Templar; such as tunnels that have yet to be excavated that are rumored to at least have the potential for artifacts undiscovered since the fall of the Knights Templar.  This DVD is one of the more basic introductory level videos, and won't satisfy many researchers, some of the interviews are with scholars who have a very heavy brogue and most of whom are quite cynical about details alleged by what little literature offers down through time since the rise and fall of the Knights Templar; although the narrator's voice is distinct and easily understandable.  I found this DVD sufficient only to beat insomnia, and was disappointed in the superficial substance from a quality distribution studio that obviously spent some time and expenditure to produce.  Costuming for reenactment sequences is as good as anything Hollywood has, but we probably only need to see those clips in this video once, not multiple times of the same sequence.  Entertaining, for what there is of it this video has been done with quality, and is good enough for the uninitiated as a starting point toward learning about the Knights Templar, but far, far from genuinely informative (more or less between elementary school and junior high students seems to be the marketing audience).",1303603200,6,1818,5.149152542372882
2892714,3,B000T28PLU,"The Templar story is riveting and the talking heads are very good, but the piece itself is really pretty shoddy.  A truly glaring gaffe is their repeatedly showing a portrait of a man they repeatedly say is the 14th century French King Philippe le Bel -- and he nothing of the sort.  The portrait is Velasquez' portrait of the 17th century Spanish King Philip IV.  (Check Google images and you'll see him for yourself.)  I.e., wrong country, wrong century, wrong man.  The show was clearly done on the cheap which is really a shame since the Templar story is so riveting.  However, the History Channel's clearly shoddy research will make me very unwilling to buy another of their DVDs.",1302825600,19,685,4.714285714285714
2892715,4,B000T28PLU,it's a history channel production so there's sufficent imagery and enlightening narration.  it is informative and enjoyable.  i'm not a huge fan of the narrators voice.  he's good but he makes me a little sleepy.,1301616000,,212,5.0
2892716,5,B000T28PLU,"Besides giving a good general overview and history of the Templars, and presenting various viewpoints, the cinematography was beautiful (on a high-def tv) and I also liked the type of chanting that they had in the background during much of the show.",1299283200,,249,4.9523809523809526
2892717,5,B000T28PLU,"I have watched quite a few DVDs, and read a few articles and a book about The Knights Templar, so I was pleased to find that this DVD had some new material in it which I had not encountered before. While one 100 minute DVD is certainly not going to become the authoritative text on the subject, I thought this was about as comprehensive as it could be in the time allowed. There is a lot of material about The Crusades, a good bit about leaders of Templars such as Jacques DeMolay, and some delving into the intriguing aspects of treasure and lost holy relics. I felt there was good balance between the skeptical and the ""we believe everything we hear"" scholars of The Knights Templar. Overall, this is the best DVD I have seen on the subject, and I would reccommend it to anyone, but especially to those who are new to the subject.",1297123200,30,832,4.374193548387097
2892718,5,B000T28PLU,I really enjoyed watching this film.  It had a lot of content and was very informative while still being able to hold the attention of my 13 year old brother.,1297036800,,158,4.266666666666667
2892719,4,B000T28PLU,"Very informative, however History used the Portrait of Philip IV of Spain by Velasquez (1652) to depict Philip the Fair.  I studied Art History and these things bother me.",1294099200,,171,4.896551724137931
2892720,5,B000T28PLU,"No one is going to accuse the History Channel of being the definitive reference for historical content: the organization is rather a vehicle to provide basic, popular history to a wide audience of history-interested viewers. If you therefore can approach a series such as this one on the Knights Templar understanding the purpose and goals of the History Channel, then it is unlikely you'll end up disappointed. To the contrary, this introduction to the Knights Templar is brilliantly scripted, filmed, and acted, and the series can serve, not only as a great way to understand this medieval organization, but to be thoroughly entertained as you do.

Without trying to reproduce the content that is presented in this series, we can say that this set of four episodes will provide a thorough grounding to understand the Templars, and will do so in a manner that is detailed enough to easily allow the non-historian to segue from the show into additional derivative studies. Although there is a certain mystique about this group that has been fanned in recent years by some best-selling novels, the producers here attempt to stay a steady course through the topic without resorting to too much speculative ideas (although there are some reproduced here, particularly at the end of the series).

In addition to a very strong script, the location filming, along with superior quality video equipment, makes this more of an epic movie in its production values. There is not a moment when we think we are watching poor recreations or sub-standard video reels: this is truly state-of-the-art production quality (although, no, it is not high-definition), and the costumes, recreated scenes, and site locations make this production stand out from others. Be sure also to see the bonus footage, which shows some of the background in creating the series, also an excellent production itself.

Easy five stars for production, script, and meeting the objectives of learning about the Knights Templar. I'd be thoroughly surprised if you did not enjoy it as much as I did!",1292284800,62,2057,5.079881656804734
2892721,4,B000T28PLU,"This is a good video to learn about the Knights Templar, their history at the start of the Crusade to their demise in 1307.

The first few chapters talk about its origins during the first Crusade. The organization started out as protectors of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. Unfortunately, the vast majority were illiterate killers, psychopathic monks, who pillaged, plundered, raped and murdered anyone they could (and not just Muslims). They were in short not the ""knights in shining armor"" that more romantic stories led you to believe, but more like Special Forces soldiers on steroids, or, better yet, the first church-sanctioned terrorist group. So how did a once elite and honorable group of knights fell so quickly out of power? Had they become too wealthy (they organized what many would call the first international money-lending banks in western Europe). Did the church forced them into secrecy? Few documents exist today that prove anything about this rough-and-tumble warriors that even made Saladin cringe in horror.

Athough there are plenty of short reenactments here, they are background. You don't waste much time watching Hollywood fat guys wielding rubber swords at each other and screaming death cries into the microphone. You can even play this in your car's CD player on your way to work and listen to informative narrative.

The nice thing about this documentary is that the historians are honest about how or why the Templar fell. No one knows for sure. There are plenty of reasons of why the knights saw their demise. Speculation abounds here, such as were they forced into anonymous secrecy once it became known that the knights had discovered hidden documents about Jesus and Magdalene, documents the Catholic church did not want publicized? Why is so little known about the demise of these once-elite soldiers?

Although the documentary loses some focus in the last two chapters (there are 13), and there is some repetition of the text in chapters 2-4, I still would recommend this video for novice historians. This may not win any glorious awards, but it will educate and perhaps even entertain the viewer.",1285804800,,2140,5.0710227272727275
2892722,4,B000T28PLU,"This documentary does a great job presenting the rise and fall of the Templar Knights.  Everything from the theories of their origins, through their military role (especially their famous battles with Saladin), and their financial/banker roles are all nicely covered.  Rumors and conspiracy theories are laid out but not presented as fact.  The experts are not particularly exciting but they are not too dull.  The problem with many history channel videos, with too much repetition following commercial breaks, is not at all bad with this one.  So, if you want to learn about the Templar Knights, this is a good disk.",1274486400,36,617,5.069306930693069
