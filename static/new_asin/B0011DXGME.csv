8241471,5,B0011DXGME,"You cannot believe this man's voice!  Even though it is an older album it is still unbelievable.  If you listen with particular attention to the song, ""Just as I am"" and at about the 2:19 mark you will hear UNBELIEVABLE voice control!  I have never heard anything like it!  Not only is he an outstanding tenor, (F5) there is enormous power in his voice and a sustainability that few possess.  Needless to say I am a fan. :) If you can find a copy of this song you won't be sorry. Maybe download the MP3 from Amazon.
 This DVD has several pieces on it that are great. I love 'Virtuoso'.",1397347200,,585,4.2727272727272725
8241472,5,B0011DXGME,"David Phelps is a fantastic singing artist as well as writer.  A number of the songs on this recording are written by David. His Christian values are obvious and the way he can deliver a song is unbelievable.

8241474,5,B0011DXGME,"I sat one evening looking for something inspiring to watch on TV, and I turned innocently to the ""Legacy of Love"" concert by David Phelps, a singer I'd never heard of before. The minutes flew by as this man, filled with the Holy Ghost, transformed my depressed mood into a taste of Heaven! When the showing provided a website where a DVD of the concert could be ordered, I dashed to my PC faster than a speeding bullet and got my copy. I'm back here at Amazon to order four more copies for my friends and family. David, you can come to my house and lift my spirits anytime!",1198454400,5,573,4.26605504587156
