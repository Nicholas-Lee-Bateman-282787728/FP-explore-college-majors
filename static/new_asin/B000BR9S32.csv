Nothing original, ugly situations, some very ugly people (their behavior not their physical appearance). So boring I could follow what plot there appeared to be by putting the player on X2 speed and not even bothering with the subtitles. The one word I could use to describe this cinematic oddity is 'backward'.",1388707200,,434,4.576923076923077
