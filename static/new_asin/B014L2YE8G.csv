7414685,5,B014L2YE8G,"So glad I waited for the price to come down on this set. So far I am on Season 2. The first disc had a couple small hiccups (freezing) BUT they lasted seconds and recovered on their own. The quality is not bad considering the age of the show. I am very happy to have the set and love the shows from that time. If I run into any other issues with the rest of the discs I will update.
On a side note there is a brochure in the set and VEI is going to release the complete TV collection of Matt Houston. :)",1441152000,3,503,3.8
7414686,4,B014L2YE8G,I'm sorry if they expect to sale this series they better drop it to around $100.00,1441065600,4,82,4.1875
7414687,1,B014L2YE8G,The rating is for the Box Set not the show. I received my set today and as are other viewers I am pissed. The first three episodes I watched Jitter all through the show.  When ever a passing scene occurs the video blurs and shakes and you get dizzy watching it..It is disgusting. I just wrote VEI . I think all of you should do the same...This needs to be corrected ..it is like a waste of 100 dollars..Other sets they release I agree are not crystal clear but at least watchable and no jittering...this is beyond watchable!!!!,1441065600,,527,4.377551020408164
7414688,5,B014L2YE8G,"Excellent viewing quality, especially from that era. I was very impressed with the entire series in this beautifully packaged collectors box. No it wasn't filmed in HD as today's shows are. However, it holds its own clear picture and sound. The guest stars stories are always intriguing and the musical score add to the drama. I appreciate my era the 1980s. You don't find these quality shows anymore made for TV. A sure keepsake to anyone's DVD library.",1485907200,,454,4.833333333333333

7414715,5,B014L2YE8G,"Loved this old series when it was on T.V.  Wish there were more series like Hotel on today's T.V. instead of all the stupid sitcoms and trashy reality shows and regurgitated game shows with trash talking emcees of today that are apparently scheduled to be shown during the next several weeks during the Summer of '16.  Thank goodness for TCM, METV, FXRetro and a few others that although dated, show some decent and entertaining classic movies and T.V. series",1466035200,2,459,4.7974683544303796

7414720,5,B014L2YE8G,I received hotel for Christmas and after reading reviews I thought it would be a disappointing..I watched all the seasons and had no problems with the disk and the picture quality w as very good considering the show is from the 80s...the cast was excellent the storylines were engrossing and the only thing I wished there were more seasons...if you like classic tv hotel will not disappoint.,1462147200,4,391,4.850746268656716
7414721,5,B014L2YE8G,"Great series, so happy to catch it at a good sale price! Just like the Love Boat and Fantasy Island series this one had lots of well-known guest stars popping up week to week.

7414723,2,B014L2YE8G,"I'm not sure how VEI transferred this to DVD. Sharpness is fine. The problem is when the camera starts panning left & right OR up & down even at a slower pace, there's so much flickering or jittering in the images. There are quite a number of old tv series that VEI released in the past and it does not have this problem.",1459555200,9,321,4.111111111111111

7414725,5,B014L2YE8G,"I have been eagerly anticipating the arrival of these DVDs for years. True Story. I was thrilled to find season one on Amazon several years ago. By the third episode, I was hooked, utterly charmed, and transported back to my childhood ( I'm 44 now) watching season one. I could not wait to see what would happen next, especially between the characters portrayed by Connie Seleca and James Brolin. While the Hotel ""guests"" change with each episode, the series rests on the very lovable and watchable cast of the Hotel ""staff."" And, let me tell you, they are absorbingly fun to watch. It's easy to be hooked. Ann Baxter is always delightful, and doesn't disappoint here. I would surely recommend this. At its present price, around $13 a season, it's more than worth every dime.",1458950400,5,775,4.7481481481481485
7414726,2,B014L2YE8G,"This set has very poor video quality with jittering on scan shots. I have season 1 of Hotel released by Paramount and the quality was quite good. This Complete series set by VEI is a big contrast to that. I own well over a 100 TV shows on DVD and Blu-ray and I must say this is one of the worst I've seen. Not only is the image quality poor, there are jittery movements on scan shots and it can be blurry at times. I think watching it prolonged would get on your nerves after a while. I ended up sending the set back. I own the Cagney & Lacey set by VEI and have no problems with it's quality considering it age. Unless Hotel is your favorite show of all time and you are willing to take whatever you can get, I would dissuade anyone against purchasing it. It really is a shame because I have such fond memories of Hotel and I so looking forward to enjoying it again. I plan on calling VEI to let them know of my disappointment.",1458518400,14,928,4.076502732240437

7414731,5,B014L2YE8G,Let me first say the picture quality is not the best the sound quality is also not the best. That being said. I think this product is worth every penny you spend. I got this for a steal but I would have gladly paidmore. It is very watchable and the star quality is on comparable to none I enjoyed watching these shows when I was little and now I'm able to watch them again I was very skeptical because of the other reviews but I've had no problems with any of the discs and they are very watchable and understandable I wholeheartedly recommend this product if you enjoy the show back then you will not be let down don't listen to the other reviews if you enjoy the show I highly recommend it one more time,1454457600,19,705,4.1911764705882355

7414735,4,B014L2YE8G,"Hotel was a very good series created from both the Arthur Hailey book of the same name and the movie from the late 60's.  Hotel gives us a glimpse at a luxury hotel which is a throwback to a much different era, a time when hotels were full of luxurious features and the staff's main objective was to take care of the guest's needs.

Each episode shows us different guests checking in and all have some baggage or love Interest that is worked out by the end of the episode.  The hotel prided itself on having guests leave with a happy ending to their story.  In some ways it is a combination of The Love Boat and Fantasy Island, with our own resident Mr. Roark in the person of Peter McDermott portrayed by James Brolin.  His assistant portrayed by the lovely Connie Selecca.

True to Aaron Spelling form we get an amazing crew of guest stars from week to week to provide the story.  Through the course of the 5 seasons we see Tori Spelling from a pre-teen through her teenage years pre Donna  Martin as she guest stars in about 5 episodes.  Along the way we also see a very young George Clooney. We also saw soap greats Luke anD Laura guest starring in separate episodes.  Several of the episodes are directed by none other than Larry  (JR) Hagman.

All things considered,  Hotel is a series worth watching,  and a good addition to any collection.",1453161600,15,1347,4.4227642276422765
7414736,5,B014L2YE8G,"Nothing wrong with this collection. The original in TV was in analog and not every distributor is going to remaster the original to HD.. Just be happy that someone decided to offer the entire series on DVD. Besides, anyone who has seen the original on TV ( like me) doesn't want to see 'big hair' in HD. OK joke over, just glad the price was reduced and I get to watch something from the past. Any Hotel fan will be please, just don't be nit-picky ""oh geeze  I can't see the lines on xxx faces"" Really?",1452556800,12,502,4.229166666666667
7414737,5,B014L2YE8G,"I too like many were skeptical about ordering this set as the quality was being questioned. Well, so far I have watched most of the seasons and will say that while this is not HD quality, it is just fine for what it is...a show from 30+ years ago. I have not had any problems with viewing any of the episodes and have enjoyed each one so much! Seeing all the stars that are now long gone has been just a delight. Sometimes as an episode began and I would see who the guest stars were, I was really amazed that a 'movie star' of that caliber had been on a TV show. I have been having the best time watching these again after all these years. The guest list is hundreds of names long and unlike the Love Boat, Hotel was less comical and dealt with subjects like rape, bigotry, alternative lifestyles and much more including of course romance! I would not shy away from buying this set, the quality is really fine for what you are getting. I think too many people want perfection in all things, and with shows that are 30, 40, or 50 years old, we have to compromise and enjoy what we can from those bygone days! ***UPDATE*** 07/01/16 *** I have finally watched all 5 seasons and have not found any viewing problems at all. No jittering of the screen, no audio problems, nothing at all to complain about. I have been overwhelmed with the delicious number of stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood!!! This has been a true delight!! Loved seeing the entire series again after all these years! Bravo VEI!!",1450656000,29,1498,4.353571428571429
7414738,5,B014L2YE8G,"I was a bit worried about this purchase from comments I had read here on Amazon. Then I noticed that most of the reviews were done before this collection was ever released! Anyway, I have not watched every episode of this collection, but from what I have watched, I have been very pleased.
The quality of the episodes are fine and it is exciting to see those ""old classic stars of days gone by"" checking into the fictional St. Gregory Hotel.
Debbie Reynolds! Elizabeth Taylor! Engelbert Humperdinck! Tori Spelling! Susan Anton! The list goes on and on. Great fun for the nostalgic.",1450569600,31,581,4.705882352941177
7414739,2,B014L2YE8G,"Got the Hotel complete collection today in the mail. Where do I start.the packaging is great..nice sturdy box with the individual seasons wrapped in their own cases.nice beautiful art covers on the cases..the main menus feature 4 episodes per disc on the main pageyou get 4 boxesin each box you see the episode playing.underneath the box is the title of episodethose look very nice.now the actual episodespicture quality..there is their usual message about how old this episodes are and how things might look good or might look good because of DVD transfer.the openings are in terrible shape but thats not a surprise as most if not all 80s openings aren't going to be remastered..the episodes themselves have some jarring.jittering to them.like the picture gets out of focus and the picture jitters to catch upit is very distracting. I checked all the seasons and all of them have it with the last season having less of it.and no the episodes are not remastered.not a surprise..when the picture isn't jittering though the picture isn't that badif VEI had spent just a little time remastering the episodes I'd say 25% percent of itthe picture quality would have been fantastic! Of course some episodes look better than others.some have more grain than others..etc.the audio on it is goodvery loudI had to turn down the volume of my tv.so no problems with volume.as for DVD freezes.etcdidnt have any problems so far with the set..

Hearing the music and seeing the opening graphics brought goosebumps..lots of great guest stars that I had forgotten appeared..I wish though that I had waited for the price to go down a bit lower. For the 4 seasons you are getting because season 1 was out before. Id say a good price to get this at would be no more than 69 dollars. I am still glad I got it but wish I had waited for a lower price drop.

Final thoughts..I doubt VEI will fix that jarring on the video..as I said if VEI had spent just a fourth of the remastering of this great show.it would have looked outstanding!  VEI statement of them not being able to fix problems is so false when CBS Video gave us a remastered season 1...

When Barnaby Jones comes out in December. I will wait until the price goes down very low..its not worth the 160 they are asking for it now..",1447027200,9,2267,4.674185463659148

7414741,5,B014L2YE8G,"My rating is for the series. Yes, I agree that the price is too high and VEI has released marginal quality DVD'S in the past. Although we don't yet know what the DVD quality of this release will ultimately be. Now if they would only release the complete series of The Love Boat and Fantasy Island.",1444608000,7,297,4.321428571428571
7414742,1,B014L2YE8G,"Like everyone else,  I am shocked by the price of this set. Yes, the first set was expensive when I first purchased it; however,  I would think the cost might be lower than if I were purchasing each season individually.  I'd be curious to know how much it costs to license this series.",1444348800,4,285,4.339622641509434
7414743,2,B014L2YE8G,"What can one say?
Well....it goes down hill rather fast after the first series.
It becomes standard and dreary and not enough is made of certain capable charachters.
The violence against women ratio per season is quits high and its vulgar brutal and boring and it is relied on with consumate ease as a plot device over and over.
I hated this actually.
The first season is truly brilliant, eminently watchable,also the picture quality is excellent on the older release, which I have.
The picture quality reaches levels that one could only describe as 'student campus film' quality, was this shot on 35 ml or 16 ml? Who can tell at times, the grain is so bad and wash out and contrast over under brightness, my remote just didn't stop!
All in all, this really would only have been a little more worthy if the proceeding seasons had of been up to the 2009 season 1 release picture quality wise, its just to hard and dull to watch.",1443398400,2,927,4.523809523809524
7414744,2,B014L2YE8G,"Like the other reviews, I agree with the price. Too high. It should actually be $75, $100 at the most. Oh, and It's $410.00 on ebay.",1442966400,2,132,4.115384615384615
7414745,3,B014L2YE8G,"I was very excited to see the release of the rest of this wonderful series.  However, after looking at the price, I feel the company that is releasing it is taking advantage of people who just want to enjoy classic television.  The price is too high and seeing reviews about the quality of past releases makes me a bit skiddish on any purchase.  I hope that Amazon can somehow work it out to get the series on their Instant Video or Prime list.",1442880000,2,444,4.325301204819277
7414746,2,B014L2YE8G,"Seriously, I have been waiting since season 1 for season 2 but this is no high end dvd company, they give low quality,""economy"" sets but every new set gets higher and higher prices. I love old shows, I am a great target for these things but not for high priced risky sets where history shows they are incompetent and do not care about quality. I won't be buying it without a big discount and hundreds of verified reviews that have no disc problems. What a joke.",1442016000,2,461,4.372093023255814
7414747,1,B014L2YE8G,"This price is outrageous and given my experience with VEI product quality I have very little interest in purchasing this set even though I have the 1st season and would like the remaining seasons. I purchased the Nash Bridges Complete Set only to have nothing but disc problems throughout the set. The disc skipped, some wouldn't play at all, no chapters. After 3 months of back and forth with VEI I finally received a second set. The only thing that was fixed was that the episodes that wouldn't play at all now played. The glitches were still present in the exact spots on the exact episodes of the 2nd set. I'll wait for reviews about quality before making this purchase and only with a price drop.",1441411200,21,701,4.571428571428571

8731310,3,B014L2YE8G,"Disk packaging Very Disappointing.  One plastic box for All disks. What a mess. Season one was at bottom of pop up and in the style where dvds overlap.

I bought this without having watched this series before.
So I was surprised by the amount of sleeping together, skimpy nighties, etc makes for very sexual content. Had been looking for some clean older tv shows. When someone is in the shower sometimes they r so close and the lighting directed on door in a way that u can see the body very distinctly.

They do have several story lines Per Episode.  So the pace moves fairly quickly.  But wish less sex oriented and then could give more content in each story. Good writing just each story wraps up so quickly when they could have had more substance.",1488153600,,752,4.5
