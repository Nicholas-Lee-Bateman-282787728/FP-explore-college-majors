8545646,5,B009ZCMCPK,"I am an ardent fan of BBC's Ghost Stories for Christmas which was originally released in the 1970s right around Christmastime and later revived in the 2000s (though only three episodes were made during this period). Knowing how much I love the stories, a good friend of mine purchased the set from the Amazon UK site as a birthday gift (the DVDs will only play on multi-region DVD players).

Here's a breakdown of what the DVDs contain with a description of the episodes:

Disc One
Whistle and I'll Come to You (1968 and 2010 adaptations)
Jonathan Miller and Christopher Frayling discuss the 1968 adaptation (2012, 3 mins)
Introduction to the 1968 adaptation by British horror master Ramsey Campbell (2001, 16 mins)
M.R. James' original story read by Neil Brand (2001, 42 mins)
Ramsey Campbell reads his M.R. James' inspired story, ""The Guide"" (2001, 27 mins)

Disc Two
The Stalls of Barchester (1971) and A Warning to the Curious (1972)
Filmed Introductions with director Lawrence Gordon Clark (2012)
Ghost Stories for Christmas with Christopher Lee - narration of two M.R. James' stories, i.e. The Stalls of Barchester and A Warning to the Curious (30 mins each)

Disc Three
Lost Hearts (1973), The Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974) and The Ash Tree (1975)
Filmed Introductions with director Lawrence Gordon Clark (2012)

""Lost Hearts"" was adapted for the BBC by Robin Chapman in 1973, and directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark. It tells the story of a young boy, Stephen (Simon Gipps-Kent) who is sent to live with his reclusive uncle in the country. His uncle (Joseph O'Connor) is obsessed with the idea of immortality, and young Stephen is haunted by two entities, gypsy children with their hearts missing.

""The Treasure of Abbot Thomas"" made its TV debut in 1974 and the story focuses on the tale of a scholar, Reverend Somerton ( played by Michael Bryant), who finds the hidden treasure of a sinister abbot. In the feature adaptation, Somerton has a protg, Lord Peter Dattering (Paul Lavers) who assists him in his efforts. This addition of a protg is an artistic liberty taken by the producers as it is not found in the source work. This is a highly atmospheric tale and the score is positively creepy.

""The Ash Tree"" is one of my favorites of all of James' stories. I remember getting nightmares after I first read it and even until today, I feel uneasy reading this story. A young gentleman inherits an ancestral manor and from the time he takes possession of the manor, he begins having strange visions having to do with the past. His ancestor had condemned a suspected witch to death and this event comes back to plague the descendant. The young man is particularly troubled by an old ash tree outside his bedroom window and the finale is one that is utterly horrifying. Even though the effects seem dated by today's standards, there is still a menacing and chilling air throughout the story and watching the climax gave me the shudders!

Disc Four
The Signalman (1976), Stigma (1977), and The Ice House (1978)

The Signalman, is an adaptation of a short story by Charles Dickens and was telecast in 1976. It is an effectively creepy tale, with the seemingly innocuous words ""Hello, below there!"" that signals (no pun intended) the beginning of a strange and surreal tale. The phrase is uttered by a traveler (Bernard Lloyd) who is out on a walk when he calls down to a signalman whose gaze appears to be transfixed by something at the mouth of the railway tunnel. The traveler finds the signalman (Denholm Elliott in an understated yet thoroughly convincing performance) strangely afraid of him, but when the signalman discovers the traveler is not whom he thought he was, a friendship of sorts develops between the pair and the traveler joins the signalman at his signal box. Over a cup of tea, the traveler concludes that the signalman is a man of some learning but is obviously suffering some level of anxiety over an unnamed trouble.

The story develops slowly but surely, and when the traveler does eventually discover the source of the signalman's anxiety, he tries to help his new friend by providing a rational explanation. Of course, in a ghost story, one knows that not all things can be explained in a rational manner. The performances by both characters are compelling, especially the credible portrayal of the besieged signalman by Elliott. I found the story to be highly atmospheric, and there's a palpable sense of looming danger that permeates the story and is made all the more real by the convincingly creepy soundtrack, especially in the sound of the warning bell.

At around 40 minutes, this is a short dramatization, but the cast and story make this one of the best in the series. It left me with a deep sense of melancholy and yes, horror.

The second story, ""Stigma"" was telecast in 1977 and was scripted by Clive Exton. Unlike the earlier ghost stories featured in this series, especially the first few which were based on the master M.R. James' short stories, I feel Stigma does not really conform to the atmospheric ghost story genre. It is quite straightforward and leaves little to the imagination (which is why I favor the earlier stories and also The Signalman). In this story, a family of three live in a house in the countryside. There is some construction work going on in a field nearby and the disruption of the ancient stone circles in the field unleashes a long dormant terror. The unsuspecting family is impacted, especially the mother who begins to notice bleeding but can't seem to find the source. It is only towards the end, when one of the ancient stones is lifted and a skeleton unearthed does the viewer begin to understand what precipitated these strange events. Though ""Stigma"" is a supernatural tale, it is not a ghost story and I felt that it was not as well-made as the earlier stories.

Lastly, there's ""The Ice House"" which was telecast in 1978. This story is set at a health spa where mysterious events occur, having to do with a particular flower growing on the grounds. Though it has its creepy moments, I felt that this, in addition to Stigma, was a far cry from the antiquarian feel of the earlier episodes.

Disc Five
A View from a Hill (2005) and Number 13 (2006)

""A View from a Hill"" (2005) has a young historian, Dr. Fanshawe (Mark Letheren) on a visit to Squire Richards' house where he is to do some cataloguing. Whilst at the Squire's house, Fanshawe wishes to see the sights around the countryside and when his binoculars break, he borrows a pair from the Squire (Pip Torrens) which turns out to have belonged to the historian that was there before him. Little does he realize that the binoculars have been bewitched and he will see things that no mortal should see. Fanshawe's exploration of the countryside brings him to an open field and when he looks through the binoculars, he sees an abbey that should no longer be there - all that is left of it are ruins. Next to this abbey is Gallows Hill, a notorious local landmark known for being a place of execution. Squire Richards' butler, Patten senses the young man's fascination for the ruins and knows the dark secret behind the binoculars having to do with the previous historian who was also similarly obsessed with the abbey and Gallows Hill. As times passes, Fanshawe gets more obsessed with the ruins, not realizing that he has stirred up the old spirits that inhabit the ruins and Gallows Hill, spirits that are now bent on claiming him for their own. This adaptation is quite well-done and credibly cast. There's a palpable sense of menace that stays with the viewer after the last scene.

""Number 13"" (2006) stars Greg Wise as an academic who puts up at an old inn during a visit where he is to authenticate some old papers dating back to the Reformation period in England. He is assigned to Room 12 and notices that there is no room 13, and that the next room is 14. One night though, he discovers to his surprise and eventual horror that room 13 has mysteriously materialized. He investigates and soon finds the dark secrets behind room 13, a secret that could very well place his very soul in peril.
