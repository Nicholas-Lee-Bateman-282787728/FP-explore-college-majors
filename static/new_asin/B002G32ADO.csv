8369675,5,B002G32ADO,Ufc 98 was by far the best I've seen in ufc early days and to see the end of the title fight between Rashad evens vs lyoto machida  one word WOW...,1448150400,,147,3.7419354838709675

8369677,5,B002G32ADO,"After his 1st non-win, a DRAW, against Tito Ortiz, Rashad won a split decision over TUF #3 winner, Michael Bisping, in UFC 78, and he remained undefeated. Finally in UFC 88, it was time for a test, and that test was Chuck Liddell. And mid-way through the 2nd round, Rashad not only knocked out The Iceman, he knocked him out COLD! And after that, it was his turn to fight for the title, still undefeated, against the original Ultimate Fighter, Forrest Griffin. And after having the first two rounds taken away from him, Rashad Evans found his opening, got his TKO, and his Light Heavyweight belt. Now, who to defend it against? Well, after a 1st round KO of Thiago Silva, fellow undefeated Lyoto Machida would get that honor. Sam Hoger, David Heath, Kazuhiro Nakamura, Sokoudjou, and Tito Ortiz were all the names that have stepped into the octagon with Lyoto Machida. Not ONE had yet to even win a single round against the karate master. And Machida's goal was to simply win this fight and be the new Light Heavyweight champion. Rashad Evans would say that he didn't worry about what Machida was doing, Machida should worry about what he's doing, and he was going to knock Machida out! That was the Main Event for UFC 98.

The Co-Main Event was a heated grudge match that had been seething since season 6 on The Ultimate Fighter. Matt Hughes and Matt Serra both have the exact same thoughts. They don't like each other, and they just want to hit each other! Enough said.

There are 10 fights on this DVD, and they actually included pre-fight and post interviews, with the exception of one. I will list the fights below.

Dave Kaplan vs. George Roop: After TUF 10, both of these guys were on the Finale card. Kaplan fought a FIGHT OF THE NIGHT performance on the losing end to Junie Browning. Roop fought a hard fought battle, only to lose a split decision to Shane Nelson. This would be a good scrap that earns a split decision for the winner.

Yoshiyuki Yoshida vs. Brandon Wolff: Both of these guys had nightmare performances when they fought for the troops. One of them gets some sweet redemption with a quick submission in the 1st.

Krzysztof Soszynski vs. Andre Gusmao: Hard cranking kimuras and a tough attitude bring these two together. But one shows the other the meaning of KO power, and in the 1st round!

Phillipe Nover vs. Kyle Bradley: Well, despite a questionable stoppage just a minute into the fight, the winner doesn't offer much apology. He won, and that was good enough for him. And I suppose, there's nothing anybody can do about it.

Pat Barry vs. Tim Hague: Brutal slugger is ready to offer some brutal punches and kicks for newcomer Tim Hague. THE TRASHING MACHINE just might have other ideas. One idea becomes a reality in the 1st round with a great finish!

Brock Larson vs. Mike Pyle: Props to Mike pyle for taking this on a day's notice for Chris Wilson. Is he ready for Larson? A submission in the 1st is the answer to that question!

Sean Sherk vs. Frank Edgar: I was tickled to death with this fight, and I watch it with a big smile every time I do! Unanimous decision, too bad for the loser!!

Chael Sonnen vs. Dan Miller: After his last performance, Dan Miller is pretty certain he knows Sonnen's weakness. But this is a fight fought with wit, and a unanimous decision is awarded for the effort.

Drew McFedries vs. Xavier Foupa-Pokam: POP-POP-POP...POW!!! Under 40 seconds and you have your KO of the night!!!

Matt Hughes vs. Matt Serra: Some say this could've gone either way. Either way, here's your grudge match, that goes to a unanimous decision.

Rashad Evans vs. Lyoto Machida: Both came in undefeated, one got handled the whole way through, and got KO'd in the 2nd round. People will be watching this champion and wondering who can take him out!

Lots of good stuff on this double DVD. Everything we liked that we thought had been taken away. I enjoyed this the whole way through. The Countdown was awesome as well! ENJOY!!",1259452800,,3965,4.597733711048159
8369678,4,B002G32ADO,"So yeah this event was so-so but at least the DVD's are back to the way they were. I won't post the fights cos other reviews already have them. ALL fights are on one DVD while the other has the Countdown show, Backstage bonus, and the weigh-in show. Plus it has all the intro's to the fights and all the Rogan interviews post fights. Keep em coming like this and I'll be fine. Pre and post press conference would be nice too. Enjoy.",1251158400,5,432,4.216867469879518

I could not wait to see Serra crush Hughes and when this event was announced I was extremely excited.

1. DAVE KAPLAN VS GEORGE ROOP-we start out with a nice first round as both guys are looking to find their range. Both throw some good strikes and Roop even reopens a cut on his opponent's nose. The second round looked a lot like the first with a couple of take downs, decent round. The third round is the best with some take downs and some nice strikes, it looks close to a draw but Roop takes the split decesion. 4/5

2. YOSHIYUKI YOSHIDA VS BRANDON WOLFF-this is a very good fight that only last a few minutes into the first. Wolff gets caught in a tight guillotine and taps out, twice. The ref did not see the first tap out, Yoshida takes it. 5/5

3. KRZYSZTOF SOSZYNSKI VS ANDRE GUSMAO-great  fight once again that does not make it out of the first, both guys trade in this one. But it is Krzysztof who takes the win knocking out Andre. 5/5

4. PHILLIPE NOVER VS KYLE BRADLEY-this one is kinda full of controversy as Kyle knocks out Nover, and yes he did. The ref jumps in after Nover goes limp but Nover regains his senses really quick so it looks like a bad stoppage. But we you see the replay thee is no doubt that he was out if only for a second, good stop ref, it protects the fighters. 5/5

5. PAT BARRY VS TIM HAGUE-once again we are witness to a first round stoppage between these two fighters. Tim looked like he was going to loose this one as he was rocked early, but he came threw and locked in a nice guillotine choke. 5/5

6. BROCK LARSON VS MIKE PYLE-this one is a very well paced and exciting fight with both trying to pull off submissions and scrambling. But Larson eventually pulls of an arm triangle and it was very tight. Great fight that ends in the first round. 5/5

7. SEAN SHERK VS FRANK EDGAR-I could not believe this fight when I was watching it live, Sherk's game plan just blew me away. I never doubt Edgar but I was completely surprised that Sean did not really try to utilize his strongest point, his wrestling more. He wanted to show off his hands more and he would end up losing because of it. The first round was good with Edgar looking a little better, but Sherk does his thing. The second round is just as good with Edgar looking even better then in the first, picking Sean apart. The last round just sees Edgar dominate Sherk and takes a unanimous decision win. 5/5

8. CHAEL SONNEN VS DAN MILLER-excellent first round with a great showing from both fighters but the story in round one was ground and pound. The second round is just like the first with some good ground and pound. The third round looks just like the first 2 with Sonnen dominates Dan and takes the win. 4.5/5

9. DREW MCFEDRIES VS XAVIER FOUPA-POKAM-quickest fight of the night right here with Drew laying out Xavier, 37 seconds. This is one quick and exciting fight, especially for the casual fan. 5/5

10. MATT SERRA VS MATT HUGHES-if there was ever I fight I wanted to see happen it was definitely this one. I am the biggest Matt Serra fan in fact him and BJ Penn are my favorites ever. I have never ever been a Hughes fan and I agree with every thing Serra has said about him. If you go back and watch Hughes during the show Ultimate Fighter seasons 2, 4, and 6 you will agree. What he does and says about a guy that was one of his own fighters on season two is despicable, Hughes is what Serra says he is. Serra brings it to Hughes in the first round winning with the stand up and even when Hughes takes him down and gets his back Serra gets right back up. He clearly takes the first round as the judges agree with me. The second round is just plain bull as Hughes takes him down and lays on him for the whole round, only throwing a strike when the ref says something. A totally weak round as Hughes literally just lays on him for most of the round. In the third round Hughes gets the take down early but Hughes just wants to lay on him. This time from the bottom Serra goes for umaplatas and triangles showing he is the aggressor even from the bottom. Then when they get stood back up Serra continues to win with the strikes and then takes Hughes down with a nice slam and ground and pounds him, Hughes even cheats and grabs the fence [illegal] to help improve his position. Then Serra goes for the kimura when the round ends but after the fight Hughes raises Serra's hand and even Joe says he should not have shown the judges, Hughes knew he lost. I can not believe the judges gave this fight to Hughes because Serra clearly won this fight hands down 2 rounds to 1. I can not wait for the rematch, Serra will end him before the fight ends. I will give this fight five out of five because Serra won this fight, SERAA REALLY WON.5/5

11.[LIGHTHEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP]RASHAD EVANS VS LYOTO MACHIDA-the main event of the night would see two undefeated fighters go at it for the title with this being Evans first title defense. The first round is really all about feeling each other out but Lyoto lands some nice kicks and even knocks Rashad down at the end of the round. The second round is great with Lyoto controlling the round landing all kinds of strikes and eventually knocks Evans out. A new champion is crowned and now he has to look forward to the great Shogun for his first title defense. 5/5

this was a pretty good night of fights with SERRA BEATING HUGHES, I could care less what any body says go back and watch it with out picking favorites and you will see Serra won.",1250812800,2,5503,4.278846153846154
8369680,4,B002G32ADO,"If you want to own a piece of UFC history then buy this DVD.  While it's probably going to suck (in terms of extras and other reasons for owning this DVD), it is worth the price of purchase to own Machida vs. Rashad Evans.

UFC DVD's are notorious for shortchanging those who want to re-experience watching the Pay-Per-Views--as that is NOT what you get on the DVD's.  What you get instead is a chopped up version of the event (sans fighter entrances and introductions).  Even the fights that have the entrances (usually the main events and now and again the co-main event--though this was NOT the case on the UFC 94 DVD) all you get is some crappy music played over the actual songs that were played during the live events.  Cheap UFC owners...

If you are a Machida fan and are hoping for some more insight, perhaps some behind-the-scenes video of him... if this is anything like the UFC 94 DVD, then you will get absolutely NOTHING!  What a way to treat the champion of your marquee division.  So, if you already have the Machida vs. Evans fight (if you ordered the Pay-Per-View and DVR'ed it) then you don't need this stinking DVD.

Good event, but UFC usually puts out crappy DVD's.  You've been warned!",1248998400,,1208,4.550925925925926
8369681,5,B002G32ADO,"Ufc 98 was a good event , it wasn't really a stacked card , but , we got to see Rashad Defend his belt for the first time against the Dangerous Karate Master Lyoto Machida, everyone was wondering if rashad could adapt to machida's style and finally give him a loss.
Also we finally see a matchup years in the making , Matt Hughes Vs. Matt Serra  - Finally these 2 go at it , lots of talking took place before the match and it was really hyped up. Matt hughes wanted to shut serra up !

Overall the event wasn't too exciting , it did have alot of matches.
The Hughes and Serra Fight was rather boring for me,  but alot of people were expecting what happened.

The Main Event Lyoto vs Evans was awesome ! it lived up to all the hype , i was just waiting for the counters and was trying to see if rashad could stop lyoto's unique style , it builds up and then boom fireworks , i won't ruin it but it doesnt go the distance !",1248134400,2,3051,4.379061371841155
