4123441,5,B003GWFAP4,"I saw this on television eons ago and haven't seen it since but I could still remember every crappy scene.  Made in 1979 but not televised until 1983, this film follows the misadventures of a group of people trapped underground with a crazy killer!  If that sounds exciting....I'm sorry, it's just the premise.  What this movie should have been titled is: CAVE-INs!  It starts with a mini-cave-in, which doesn't warrant closing down the Five Mile Caverns (after all, no one was killed).  After the dust settled, they happily shove a bunch of tourists into the caverns, hither and yon, when cave-in number two takes place, trapping a senator (Susan Sullivan) with a CRAZY killer (James Olson).  That's when all the unfortunate flashbacks start happening.  I kid you not; everyone has at least 1 or 2 flashbacks.  Characters just stare off into space while a dim recollection flashes across the screen, then they snap out of it because life goes on and then there's another cave-in (I lost count at that point but made a memo to myself, don't go into any caverns).  They join together under the guidance of ranger Gene (Dennis Cole) and scramble through the bowels of the earth (little more than an obstacle course with few real obstacles or danger).  I was a little disappointed because they weren't killing off characters willy-nilly like they do in most of Irwin Allen's flicks.  Sad to report, only one death....off screen; this was television after all.  Even so, it's so inept that it's fabulous.  I haven't seen this much melodrama since.......

But make no mistake about it, this is utter rubbish!

I love it, and I'm keeping it.",1314057600,4,1635,4.830935251798561

8396580,3,B003GWFAP4,A little too cheesy for me. The worst of Irwin's films in my mind. Still watchable but there is much better films by him out there.,1449360000,,131,4.076923076923077
8396581,5,B003GWFAP4,Great movie.  Remembered it from years before and was glad to find it on DVD,1437350400,2,76,4.066666666666666
8396582,2,B003GWFAP4,"I remember Dennis Cole and always thought better of him. 1979 and Irwin Allen was groping for disasters to put on the screen (many of them were, including this mess). first the background overly dramatic music, horrible. The acting is stiff and bad by all. Dear God, the dialog, a 10 year old could do better. he always puts these terrible side plots in his movies (who cares). The usual types of characters....the handsome hero (Dennis Cole), the ex-cop who caused his partner to die (leslie Nielsen pre-funny) and his wife the agonizing Julie sommars, The handsome heroes ex who moved onto better things as a senator and left him behind (Susan Sullivan) The bickering family of dad (Ray Milland barking all the time) and his daughter (no clue) and finally the criminal who took refuge in the cave?????? I don't know. Awful performances and an awful idea....I'm surprised he didn't produce the much acclaimed ""slipping on a Banana Peel"" dum-dum-duuuuummmmmmm.",1423180800,3,960,4.968944099378882
8396583,5,B003GWFAP4,"Dennis Cole does a great job as the ranger helping people trapped in a cave-in. This was released in 1983,but was made in 1979. With a name cast this B-fim made for television is pretty entertaining Fans of Dennis Cole, and  disaster films will like this the most.",1357948800,2,264,4.5
8396584,5,B003GWFAP4,"IRWIN ALLEN always had the talent for putting star-studded casts in dangerous peril and the audiences that watch them on the edge of their seats,and he does it here again with ""CAVE-IN!"".This is
one movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Not only because of the hair-
raising suspense throughout,but also due to the fact that it was
good wholesome entertainment that both you and your entire family
can enjoy without having to worry about the sex and bad language
that does so dominate Hollywood these days. In this IRWIN ALLEN
disaster flick,a group of people consisting of travelers,scientists,government officials,and a park ranger all
get trapped by the collapse of Five Mile Caverns. But there is
also someone else with the group: a mentally-deranged fugitive
that will stop at nothing to make it out alive! The group must
endure slippery inclines,a geothermal pit,an underwater passage,
a rickety bridge,and of course the mad man with the gun! The all-
star cast includes: DENNIS COLE,SUSAN SULLIVAN,LESLIE NIELSEN,JULIE SOMMARS,SHEILA LARKEN,LONNY CHAPMAN,RAY MILLAND,and JAMES OLSON.With the release of IRWIN ALLEN'S made for tv disaster movies from WarnerArchive like: ""FLOOD"",""FIRE"",
""HANGING BY A THREAD"",""THE NIGHT THE BRIDGE FELL DOWN"",and ""CAVE-
IN!"" I can only hope they'll release the last one which is
""ADVENTURES OF THE QUEEN"".Keep up the good work Warner Bros.",1315612800,8,1373,5.390697674418605
