2490561,1,B000E5KQHI,This movie sucked major @**! I hated it. It's the worst mob movie EVER!!! Don't waste your hard earned dollars buying this film.,1187222400,,128,4.608695652173913
2490562,4,B000E5KQHI,"This Mafia story has a lot of familiar elements.  I've seen most of the actors in other Mafia movies and can well understand why.  Yes, they are typecast.  That's because they are so authentic.

The plot is silly but it doesn't matter.  It's an old theme, just a bit updated.  The mob is now moving into cyberspace and international bank accounts.  The young bucks in this film get an egghead computer guy to help.  And from there on the fun begins.  There's lots of violence and double crossing.  But the most memorable stuff of all is the way the gangsters sit around a table and tell tale tales, insulting each other and having a grand old time.  I don't think there's a dialogue coach in the world who would be able to teach them the nuances and the inflections.  It is all very real.

The story is cardboard though.  A whole bunch of people get killed.  And there's not a bit of love interest in the whole thing.  Frankly, I love this type of film and I really enjoyed it.  But I guess I'm just weird this way.  Recommended for Mafia film buffs only.",1151193600,39,1055,4.350515463917525
2490563,5,B000E5KQHI,"Wow!!! Somebody has a real chip on their shoulder... F word this and that. Well look I am no mormon, and we watch movies with an open mind, because it's fantasy. Yeah the movie was heavy with vulagarities, but it comes with the territory.

Now with that said, this movie was a great introduction to a new genre of mob flicks. I mean the concept is like no other, and it hit its mark at the right time. Hey technology is constantly evolving and growing --- so why not cash in right? This film packs in all the punches, and does not hold back believe me. I loved this film; from the subtle tense beginning to the unexpected scenes of violence, to even the harsh use of profanities. This was a very entertaining film, well directed, and definitely satisfies the mob genre hunger.",1142467200,8,776,4.426573426573427

2490572,3,B000E5KQHI,"I believe a quote from seven psychopaths by Christopher walken sums this movie up best. ""It's got layers, You know?"" ""It's got... It's got layers.""

This thing of ""OURS"" was written specifically for a certain audience. Those that understand the traditions of the Sicilian mafia as portrayed in film. The story has two versions. One that is theirs being everyone who isn't in on it, and one for those who are that is Ours. Even the title hints at the subtext of the story. Every single mini story hints at it also. The words themselves along with the blood red Ours are exceptionally overt indicators of what this movie is about, but also a kind of nod to who this movie is written for. Me personally I find it clever, however it is also cliche and more than a bit tripe.

It is an esoteric piece. That makes use of Allegory within an allegory to break the fourth wall and humor their target audiences sense of being part of the story. I can see why it was made into a movie. It expertly crafted to fit the theme of the entire movie, and the title. Both ""theirs"" and ""ours"" I doubt this movie was ever intended to make money, it has pet project written all over it.

That being said. Knowing that. Knowing that played a role in the Camera work and filters, knowing it played a role in the sound. Doesn't change the fact it went beyond overt into the absurd for me. It was just trying to hard to be cute and clever, at the expense of the film itself.

Thaddeus O'Sullivan the director likely had a lot to do with these decisions in Camera work and audio. The written script I am sure was amazing as it was. I don't think they needed to incorporate those other elements, if anything they detracted from an already obvious script for it's target audience. Look he is good director that really likes to add authenticity to pieces through the audio and Camera work. The problem is this piece didn't need that, the script itself already more than accomplished it. Thaddeus O'Sullivan is one of those directors like Quentin Tarantino who just has such a poweful style that often he can overpower the script. Usually to the movies benefit. But in this case it didn't work out.",1489276800,,2167,4.4646464646464645

The scheme involves off shore accounts, Cuba, Castro, and a host of people we never see. Much of the film is consumed with tough guy talk while sitting around a table. There were many bad plot points. For instance the FBI gets a warrant for arrests, but can't arrest the guys because they are in Miami. Seriously? The mob is shown to be ignorant, as was the FBI. Their interrogation scene was lame. James Caan was wheeled in for a cameo. And BTW, $50 million in $100 dollar bills weighs 1100 pounds. It doesn't get carried around in a briefcase.

The film is stereotypically entertaining, except the fat Italian is named Wally and not Tony, however there were two guys named Anthony in the film. If you have seen a mafia film, you know what to expect. Easy on the torture. This film is currently available on a Walmart action 10 pack.

2490657,2,B000E5KQHI,"Sadly, for the promise the veteran cast held out to me initially, i.e. Frank Vincent, James Caan et.al---Danny Provenzano's This Thing of Ours is a shamelessly derivative, badly executed endeavor.  But it is also unexpectedly thought provoking in the issues it raises.

There are scenes in this film approaching unabashed, abject pilferage from the great mob movies.  It's well.... Embarrassing.

The brief inclusion of some gratuitous pseudo data re secure site encryption fails to convince us that the ""Let's bring the mob into the 21st century & make a billion"" scheme at the heart of this movie could ever work.

This project was hardly the suspension of disbelief challenge of say The Da Vinci Code, after all.

As for dialogue, anyone with half an ear---and apparently, Mr. Provenzano, currently a cast member in one of Bravo's Real Housewives franchises as himself, grew up in this milieu---anyone with half an ear can easily pick up and replicate the indigenous specifics, eccentricities, cadences;  they are, by now, infamous.

Actually, anyone who has seen any of the classics via Coppola, Scorsese, the neo Shakespearean master, David Chase....can own all of it in the time it takes to screen one movie.

Next, Mr. Provenzano, alas, has no insight at all re human individuals as individuals, and so,  no gift for depicting them as such.

Perhaps even more upsetting, given film is a visual medium: he has no ability or instinct to ""get""/differentially conjure/record VISUALS, forget storyboard a given scene.  That he may have had a shoestring budget DP is no excuse: think Nick Gomez in his genius work from the early 90s, Laws of Gravity.  The polar opposition will provide perspective.

Next, Mr. P. has little grasp of the crucial to nail nuances of editing. The formidable Thelma Schoonmaker always happily affirms she simply augments Mr. Scorsese's fastidious vision, frame by frame (now also pixel by pixel) often after exhaustive exploration and debate they both thrive on in the editing room.

But for me, beyond all of the above disappointments, most embarrassing of all: it appears Mr. Provenzano actually believes that the clich accoutrements of living large within this ghetto sensibility are what living large really is.

In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese, with his laser eye for detail,  offers us tacky decor, vulgar, sherbet colored Cadillac coupes, white minks & Christmas trees,  along with infinite related aberrations his characters are moved to.  As with everything else not arbitrary in his movies he is endowed to Bring, he does this to inform and enrich us.

Interesting that the only. brief, organically lyrical footage in this movie is a requisite private jet making a dramatic, , upwardly arching move in flight.

The related clich inclusion of a Benz convertible in this movie is compounded by that someone chose...candy apple red.  Such unwitting relegations are common in all  ghetto subcultures, but my take is Mr. Provenzano may actually not get this.  Any more than some of the principals in the Real Housewives series in which he currently appears get it.

One wonders if Mr. P. in this effort, was emulating  one of David Chase's brilliantly conceived characters in The Sopranos:  Christopher...in whom Mr. Chase imbued a blind, rabid, delusional conviction that he  could be a filmmaker depicting the milieu he was a part of.

At heart, all of Mr. Chase's characters are desperate, empty souls.  In his profound understanding of and empathy for many of them, remarkably, he envies none.  Not even secretly. I am not convinced this is true for either Mr. Coppola or Mr. Scorsese, and I cherish both.

Mr. Provenzano's envy, though, is palpable.  On the other hand. it is possible he only could have gotten this impressive veteran cast onboard, maybe for fqr less than scale,if not gratis, as some ""homage"" to what one of his relatives is rumored to have been a party to back in the day
 re Jimmy Hoffa.

We can't change the past, but we can earn our way out of its downside legacy over time. But only if we get there may well be a downside.

I caught a comment in one of the reviews here re HBO quality vs theatrical release quality (sigh) and can not let that go unaddressed.

Fact is, HBO, over time, has morphed into a precious venue for true genius in ways studios do only rarely.  HBO manifests the differential clarity & gonads to produce properties others never would.  David Chase pitched The Sopranos all over the land for years;  nobody would go there.  HBO got him, got it and went there.  The rest, as they say, is history.  Not to mention such as the singular Angels in America.

Finally re This Thing of Ours, this is still America, where opportunities, if earned, are sometimes afforded, and trying always deserves credit.

Of course, one always hopes for honest & enlightened efforts in all things.

Real talent can not be learned in a classroom, but many of the greats went to film school.  I might suggest that Mr. P. make some REAL bones by following in those footsteps.

On the hopeful side, given the ending of this movie (endgame Michael Corleone alienation/regret/sadness/loneliness), I would like to believe Mr. Provenzano may honestly get some part of the ""Be careful what you wish for"" phenomenon, especially within this and other truncated subcultures.

But frankly...it would take a lot to convince me.",1282953600,,5374,4.957494407158837

A World-Class Computer Hacker teams up with a street guy with the ""thing"" in his blood and a guy who was born ""connected"" - the three chums awkwardly but successfully convince the old school to join the new school. Small detail: they need a ton of money from the old school to make it work.
Then...the inevitable.
Story builds slowly but nicely, incorporating Computerese from the new breed with terrific, improvised-sounding dialogue from the older characters. A strong female character and a more powerful denouement might have ensured a Classic, but check this one out! Watch it High-Definition!!",1260576000,,865,5.4148148148148145

Any of the reviewers who gave this a good review have obviously no idea what makes a good mafia movie. lMy friends watched this and felt the same way.  What was James Caan thinking.  While the actors (most of them) I like from other films and t.v. shows including ""The Sopranos"", they must have been temporarily crazy when they appeared in this drivel.  Frank Vincent especially is a big disappointment both as an executive producer and as an actor.

2490664,2,B000E5KQHI,"This Thing of Ours (2003), from Danny Provenzano, is a film aimed at
the niche market of organized crime. It has an HBO-grade quality,
meaning a step above a TV movie, yet clearly below theatrical
quality.

What makes this picture interesting is first and foremost, the fact
that it takes viewers for a ride in another time and space, and
makes them forget about themselves, which is an essential quality of
good entertainment.

Secondly, there's the soundtrack composed by Joe Perry, lead
guitarist of Aerosmith, with a cameo appearance by the bassist, Brad
Whitford towards the end of the movie - a plus for fans of that
great rock band.

Although successful overall, with a necessary mix of both ugly and
beautiful numbers (yin and yang), adolescent and mature, classical
and cheap pop songs, there's an ecletic mix of music  that at times
has the movie over-indulging in a MTV music video style of
narrative. Also, the varied numbers may irritate a number of
viewers, from the numerous teenager loud-metal and dime a dozen
popsongs.

Third,  the acting is certainly credible, and viewers will find
interesting some characters, especially those of Frank Vincent,
Vincent Pastore and James Caan. Unfortunately, a number of other
actors, although excellent in their professionalism and somewhat
innocuous on screen, are totally unknowns in the business, AFAIK.

Fourth, the script introduces the concept of old-school gangsters
forging ahead past the year 2000, with computers, cell phones,
defeating communication links based on coded algoritms of satellites
in orbit through hackers. The dollar amounts of $50 million and $1
to $2 billion in the heist are staggering, and questionable in their
realism. As such, it suggests sophisticated technology as the new
religion, such that even the FBI falls into its trap, as an agent is
caught planting evidence  on closed circuit TV at a gangster's
dwelling.

Visually, this is a quasi-wide screen release, that is effective,
the editing very good, the images clear, with  good zooms from time
to time, to stoke the excitement of viewers.

The first third of the movie seems to start a bit slowly, with dry
lines of dialog, but gets better as the story  unfolds, greatly
assisted by the soundtrack that compensates for excitement, where
often none exists visually.

There are cliches, obviously (or essential elements) characterizing
this specific underworld group ...wine, spaghetti, gardening of
tomatoes, cussing, eating, lasagna as well as the selectin of
wise-guys by their external appearance, showing the techniques of
collecting money from bad debtors, victims thrown into the trunks of
a car, etc.

The downside of this picture, is perhaps the questionable graphic
nature of blood packs exploding during point-blank range rubouts,
which many will find unnecessary and distasteful, or the scenes of
electric shocks, intimidation, etc.

While this work is very professional, perhaps more could have been
done in bringing forward a few extra actors, big names that could
have brought in more charisma, class, realism and gravitas vs. some
actors with the tendency in being lightweights mixed  with the 3 or
4 big names.

The outcome of the tale, is that  ... even the best underworld
organizations show no gratitude for a few billion in profits brought
in by the 3 new members who masterminded the operation, preferring
to eliminate the risk of future stool pigeons by taking them out.",1201392000,11,3437,5.1732851985559565
