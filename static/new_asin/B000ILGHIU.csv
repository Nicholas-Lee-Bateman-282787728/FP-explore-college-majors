8422734,5,B000ILGHIU,"This is the best climbing dvd I have seen to this point , it doesn't just get 5 seconds of each climb , it actually gets most of the total climbs but not in a boring way, I recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys climbing.",1386028800,,222,3.847826086956522
8422735,5,B000ILGHIU,"Doesn't get any better than this!  Classic routes, all old school routes, lyrca and long hair!  All the newer lack the character of these older climbing movies....bring back the fish eye lens!!!!",1319068800,,195,5.0625
8422736,5,B000ILGHIU,"You get 2 dvd's in this package number 3 and 4. I watched Number 3 and it was only so so. It didn't show much scenery and they camera angles and footage where nothing to write home about, but I still watched the whole thing. Then I put in number 4 and was expecting about the same thing, to say the least I was blown away. The difference in quality between 3 and 4 is enormous. I put on #4 all the time when people come to visit and they love it. Get this dvd for #4 and consider #3 as just bonus material. Good music,  mostly Reggae",1208736000,5,533,3.935185185185185
