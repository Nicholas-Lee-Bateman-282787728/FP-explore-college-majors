8034888,5,B0002YJIZ2,"The first show on Vol. 10 has Lily Tomlin & Steve Lawrence. Both extremely talented performers, they kick off the show (what, no Carol ""bumping up the lights"" to answer audience questions??) in a musical number with the cast members (equipped with Vegas-style props which threaten to take someone out!). Then, it's Tomlin in a one-woman character piece that begins subtly & builds laughs--the type of character-driven bit carefully done as only Lily can do it. A domestic sketch has a spunky Tomlin nearly breaking up a married couple (Carol & Harvey)with her newly-acquired freedom. Steve Lawrence proves that he's more than just a singer in a Godfather-styled sketch, delivering a wonderful comic performance as a Don Corleone character. Finally, a hilarious ""women in prison"" movie parody is the highlight, with Tomlin as the warden, Carol as the new inmate scheming to break out, and Vicki Lawrence just hysterical as Carol's dumb-bell cellmate.
#2 has the terrific Alan Alda (now a big star from his starring role in ""M*A*S*H"") participating in the Christmas show. They start off things right with a Family sketch. Alda plays yet another sibling of Eunice's who's come home to celebrate the Holidays. Being a Family sketch, the holiday cheer quickly gets flushed down the drain as Alda's character finally can take no more abuse from his family & tells them off (!!). Carol & Alan do an amusing ""dating"" sketch in which Alda's character borrows lines from old movies to woo Carol. The show wraps up with a musical tribute to the East Coast, and we are reminded by Alda's strong singing voice that before M*A*S*H, he was a stage-trained actor.
Sorry folks, there is no Tim Conway in either show here. But nevertheless, Vol. 10 is enjoyable due to the shear talent on display.",1244937600,,1779,4.933333333333334
