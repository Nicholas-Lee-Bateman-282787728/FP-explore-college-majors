8289056,5,B001CSNX76,Great movie and great seller.  My brother is in this film and I had never seen it so I was super thrilled to find it.  The seller was kind enough to make a DVD copy of the tape and include it.  Thanks! It is an absolutely hilarious mockumentary - before anyone was even doing such a thing.  I gave this to my brother for his 50th birthday since he did not own a copy.  He was so happy and had lots of stories about the cast/crew and how it was done.  And...I have to say I thought my brother was the most amusing character.  Of course.,1388188800,,535,3.990566037735849
8289057,5,B001CSNX76,"I saw AMERICAN JOB in the 1990s on the Independent Film Channel and taped it on VHS. I've seen it several times since. I wish it were released on DVD.

It looked like a documentary. I wasn't sure. Research revealed that the main character, Randy, had actually worked at the minimum-wage jobs portrayed, and filmmaker Chris Smith asked the employers to allow Randy to recreate scenes of how he was hired, worked there, and eventually fired (or quit).

AMERICAN JOB follows Randy from one minimum-wage job to the next. It's like Reality TV -- but it's NOT.

The genius of AMERICAN JOB is that, unlike today's Reality TV, this film doesn't try to ""spice up"" the reality with phony conflicts. The scenes in AMERICAN JOB are mundane -- excruciatingly boring. Even so, I was mesmerized. The film conveys some powerful social commentary -- but by showing, not by telling or preaching.

AMERICAN JOB peeks into the lives of minimum wage workers. Randy works at a plastics factory, fast food restaurant, warehouse, cleaning motel rooms, and telemarketing. It's a portrait of working class Americans, portrayed not by actors, but by real working class Americans on actual job sites.

A brilliant documentary, even if the scenes are recreated.",1319328000,3,1232,4.961165048543689

I think I rented American Job when It first came out, and it was the funniest thing ever. It's just a documentary-style account of this quiet little dude who gets all these different jobs and in short order decides that it's not for him and just leaves.....You're essentially watching a guy do what you've always wanted to do. The scene where they show him pulling his car into his job at a fast food joint at dusk pretty much sums up the flick. You see the headlights go off...several seconds pass....then you see them come back on again, and the car pulls out and drives away.  Fans of American Movie will love this....If it ever becomes available on DVD, I'm there. Sorry, VHS.",1218067200,3,778,4.557142857142857
