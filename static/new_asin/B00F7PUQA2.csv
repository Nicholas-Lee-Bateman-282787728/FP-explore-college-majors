8612883,5,B00F7PUQA2,"The Brother Cadfael Mysteries are my favorite ever featured on PBS Mystery. I wish they had been able to do a show of every one of Ellis Peter's Cadfael books.  This series (season 1) has my favorite Undersheriff, Sean Pertwee. Apparently there were scheduling conflicts and he was unable to return for future seasons, so there are three different actors who play Hugh Beringer over the various seasons.",1527206400,,403,4.926470588235294
8612884,5,B00F7PUQA2,"Entertaining and very plausible mysteries set in the early medieval era. They neither turn the medieval English into moderns in old clothes nor sneer at them for their beliefs. Instead, the series shows them as people in all their complexity.",1504569600,,242,5.075
8612885,5,B00F7PUQA2,"Great mystery series and this is the first season. I had a little trouble getting the episodes in order, but the series shows a detective doesn't need DNA to solve a mystery! The time period is especially interesting and the episode on Leprosy very interesting.",1467590400,,261,4.822222222222222
