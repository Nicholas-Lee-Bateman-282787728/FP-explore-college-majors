4587965,5,B0056EBHRU,"This is the perfect gift for some college-bound offspring....  These DVD's will provide hours of pure hilarity for your young student and their friends.  These shows get funnier each time you watch.  The jokes come fast and furious, and if you're not paying close attention, you'll miss it for certain.

One of the funniest shows ever!!  Take a peek at 'YouTube' if you need to be convinced....",1367539200,,394,4.82089552238806
4587966,5,B0056EBHRU,This is one of the best shows on TV! Straight to the point and hilarious! If you try to take this show seriously your gunna have a bad time.,1357171200,,140,3.8620689655172415

4587968,5,B0056EBHRU,"I wanted to get my brother a unique birthday gift, and this is it!
This is the most singularly unique video I have ever seen.",1325635200,,125,4.04
4587969,5,B0056EBHRU,"The video speaks for itself. As for the physical product the first 2 seasons come in pretty sweet casings while the last 2 seasons are in your standard bargain bin DVD plastic case.

Theres tons of bonus footage but to my dismay most of it isn't fully animated and some of it is just the writers reading the script while you read along. This is interesting as you can see how the show moves through production and you get to hear some of the original voice pitches and script decisions but some of the funny gets lost without the visual.

Gotta love having these episodes at my disposal because watching back to back episodes for a few hours is way better than the 2 episode limit you get on Adult Swim (less than 30 minutes is never enough).",1325116800,,742,4.369565217391305
4587970,4,B0056EBHRU,I was wondering if someone could tell me why the box set is more expensive than if you buy each volume separate?,1322352000,4,112,4.136363636363637
4587971,4,B0056EBHRU,"I found Squidbillies one day while clicking through the channels on my set. I knew then and there, I had to own this set.
Raw, unapologetic humor. Just what I like.
Granted, the first season was a bit hit and miss, it does get better as you go along the series.
Just remember not to touch the trim!",1318896000,,298,4.155172413793103
4587972,5,B0056EBHRU,"I recently saw the exact same combo-pack at one of the ""big box"" electronic stores here in town.  Being a huge fan of the Squidbillies, I almost jumped on it; but something told me to check out Amazon.  I'm glad that I did, the same combo-pack was $16.00 cheaper and I got free shipping.  Need I say more???",1318118400,4,307,4.258620689655173

8459495,5,B0056EBHRU,DVDs in excellent condition. I love these damn squids. Wonderfully ignorant and (sadly) relatable.,1408924800,,98,6.071428571428571
8459496,5,B0056EBHRU,"Although Sex, Violence, and absurdity are what people are mostly stimulated by, Squidbillies does a great job (as do most Adult Swim Series') in pointing social stereotypes, class inequalities and presents them in a very creative and very funny way. This show is absolutely crazy, but I love it !",1405123200,2,296,4.94
8459497,4,B0056EBHRU,"Funny! Love this show. If you haven't seen it before look it up before you buy it, it isn't for everyone. ""Do not touch the trim!""",1389398400,,130,4.038461538461538
8459498,5,B0056EBHRU,You will have to consider all the issues writers include in their episodes to be controversial and thought provoking. I love these cartoons. Not as crass as South park cartoons but just right !,1388793600,,193,4.705882352941177

8459500,5,B0056EBHRU,"Very funny series, couldn't have imagined how funny squids could actually be.
Love how it makes fun of just about everybody, all walks of life.
Between early and Dan halen these are two of the funniest characters I've seen in a cartoon
much more than i had ever expected.
Recommend this to any body that like this kind of humor, maybe not for little kids.",1374624000,,355,4.476923076923077
