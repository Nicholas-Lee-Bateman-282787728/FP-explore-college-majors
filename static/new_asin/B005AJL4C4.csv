8463326,3,B005AJL4C4,This is for the Alpha 2016 DVD release. A tad washed out and overly light print with a nice Big Band soundtrack. Confusingly the quality falls apart mid way thru and it becomes pixelated for a few minutes. Quality goes back and forth after this from good to just ok. All things considered this is a very funny enjoyable film that is worth owning to see the lovely Ann Pennington with famous cross dresser Julian Eltinge.,1508889600,,420,4.5394736842105265
8463327,5,B005AJL4C4,I loved watching this movie because JULIAN ELTINGE starred in it and he is my first-cousin-once-removed ie my mother's first cousin. It was interesting to watch him impersonate a female. Dustin Hoffman used JULIAN ELTINGE as a role model for his part in TOOTSIE.,1382140800,3,262,4.9772727272727275
