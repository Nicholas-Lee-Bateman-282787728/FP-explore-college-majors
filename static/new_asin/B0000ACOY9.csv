8381219,4,B0000ACOY9,"GoodTimes Home Video brings us this collection of three animated features, two entertaining classic adventure tales produced by Golden Films, ""Sinbad"" and ""The Three Musketeers"" from 1992 and a newer production by a different studio from 1996, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", which was anything but impressive.  Each feature lasts around 50 minutes bringing nice entertainment for little kids.  Let me state right now that these features were not designed for the entertainment of older audiences, and if dislike animation of lesser quality (compared to Disney's), then this is not for you, kids are much more likely to appreciate them.

The first feature, ""Sinbad"" is the story of a young man who is part of a crew of sailors in a magnificent ship.  After an encounter with a horrifying sea-monster, Sinbad and his servant Habbib are left stranded in the middle of the ocean and struggling to find dry land.  The two men later find themselves in an island ruled by a noble king, after he takes Sinbad and Habbib into his home, he asks of Sinbad one single favor, to marry his daughter.  Sinbad discovers that the woman has the face of a goat and together with his servant, he abandons the island with the help of his old captain.  When the king finds out about Sinbad's betrayal, he sends for Sinbad and exiles him and Habbib to a dangerous island that homes all kinds of monsters.  Sinbad and Habbib must now rely on each other and some new friends to return to civilization.  The film opens with the very catchy song, ""As Brave as a Man Can Be"".

Second, ""The Three Musketeers"", based on Alexandre Dumas' classic story, is the tale of another young man, D'Artagnan who dreams of being one of France's musketeers.  He is noble and talented with the sword, which helps him fight off many enemies, in one particular occasion, D'Artagnan encounters his truest enemy while passing through a small village, Monsieur Roquefort who works for the evil Cardinal Richelieu.  While chasing Roquefort, D'Artagnan also meets his new friends, the three finest musketeers of France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis.  The four of them soon discover the Cardinal's wish to get rid of the Queen of France and they travel to England in order to clear her name and bring peace to their country.  This tale opens up with another catchy tune, ""All for One and One for All"".

The last feature, as I already said was very disappointing, the animation quality was the same as the other two, TV-quality, which was fine with me.  The story was pretty boring, hard for kids to follow and the design of the backgrounds and characters had that bland, modern American style of angular characters and single-colored settings.  Nothing at all like the well-designed characters and detailed, colorful backgrounds of Golden Films and Jetlag animations.  The story is based on Alexandre Dumas' other classic, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", which I never imagined being turned into an animated story for children.  It's the story of Edmund Dantes, betrayed by his friends, comrades and even his betrothed, the lovely Mercedes.  After being falsely accused, he is sent to a horrible prison by the sea, there he meets an old prisoner, who becomes his best friend during the fourteen years he spends there.  As the prisoner reaches death, he tells Edmund of an island in which he knows are many treasures, the island of Monte Cristo.  When Edmund finds it, he obtains a great wealth and becomes to mysterious Count of Monte Cristo.  The new Count, now uses his new disguise to take revenge on those who had betrayed him all those years ago and had left him with nothing.  This film features several songs, but none too memorable or as charming as those in Golden Films' animated classics.

I will definitely recommend this GoodTimes collection of animated films, for they are well worth the $12.  Even if ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" was disappointing in a number of ways, the other two features, ""Sinbad"" and ""The Three Musketeers"" are amusingly entertaining for younger audiences, 8/10.",1161475200,3,4038,4.858394160583941
