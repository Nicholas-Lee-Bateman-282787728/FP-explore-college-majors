7837331,4,6303084206,"Impressively thorough biography of Griffith, covering his whole working life in 3 parts that add up to 2.5 hours of material.

An excellent array of clips, stills, and talking head interviews with many who were there (a lot of the interviews were older, from earlier sources -- many of the people had probably passed by the time the documentary was made). More scholarly than emotional, it's a bit limited a certain tendency to be repetitive, and a seemingly strong reluctance to fully examine the awful racism portrayed in The Birth of a Nation. (Doubly odd in that many of Griffiths other pictures were very progressive socially, including the interracial romance of Broken Blossoms. That complex duality is one of the more interesting aspects of the man's career. Seems strange to step around it.).

Certainly a must see for anyone interested in the history of film, and its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.",1461715200,,916,5.019736842105263

7837333,5,6303084206,"Besides standing on it's own as an outstanding biography, ""Father of Film"" is also an important study of the birth of the film industry.  Near the end of the film, several people make on-screen appearances denying that Griffith was really responsible for some of the techniques that made him a legend.  Regardless of the dispute, it is clear that the film industry would not be the same without Griffith.
The film traces Griffith's humble beginnings in a small Kentucky town all the way to his tragic, lonely end.  Through it all we see that Griffith was, though often frustrated by circumstances beyond his control, a man driven to excellence.  His desire is evident in each film clip we see from his first short films all the way to his masterpieces such as ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Way Down East.""  Griffith had the ability that few directors have today, the ability to convey strong, powerful feelings through believable characters on-screen.  You must remember also that the majority of Griffith's story-telling was done during the silent era.  The actors had to act.  And someone had to direct them.
So many wonderful behind-the-scenes stories appear throughout the film:  the beginnings of Griffith's career, the lives of the actors, and the unexpected problems that occurred during the filming of these classics.  All of it is fascinating.  The key to any good documentary is:  Does it make you want to know more about the subject?  In this case, does it make you want to see these old, nearly forgotten silent films?  Absolutely.",979084800,8,1538,4.910852713178294
7837334,4,6303084206,"This set of three videos is put together by Kevin Brownlow ('The Parade's Gone By') and David Gill, two of the best silent film historians I have ever come across. They have done similar documentaries on Chaplin (Unknown  Chaplin), Keaton (A Hard Act to Follow) and Lloyd (The Third Genius). They  certainly know what they're talking about and I found this to be one of the  most fascinating films I have ever seen. It contains a great deal of  information about the man himself from his farming childhood to his travels  around the country with his wife and a camera, through to his funeral with  people such as Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish present. Every detail was  heavily backed up with photographs and extensive film material. Lillian  Gish is one of the many people who are interviewed for it and is a perfect  introduction to Griffith and his films. It details the filming techniques  that have shaped the film industry and how he developed them. I really  enjoyed it and it is a necessity for anyone who likes Griffith, Lillian  Gish or silent films, it is wonderfully put together and every scene is  necessary to bring to justice D.W. Griffith- The Father of Film.",955843200,7,1177,4.71078431372549
