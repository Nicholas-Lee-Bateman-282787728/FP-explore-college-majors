3829615,3,B001Y8WB22,"First of all, let me say that this concert was extraordinary--there's no denying that.  HOWEVER, the video and audio are NOT IN SYNC.  The music lags behind at least half a second, which is more than enough to be distracting, especially when Martin hits a drum or a cymbal.  It is especially distracting when you see Hiromi moving to the music (especially the fast solid beats).  It takes a lot of the enjoyment out watching it.  I just wish the engineers would have done a better job when putting all the media together.",1310688000,7,521,4.559139784946237
3829616,5,B001Y8WB22,Watched the whole DVD from start to end with my pre-teen piano-playing daughter and we are in awe... Uehara's virtuosity is pretty fierce... her spirited performance is jaw-dropping and her band backed her up very well during those spontaneous improvisational moments from her. Buy it and check out this bad ass do her thing on a Yamaha grand and a Nord Synth. Have fun!,1292284800,7,370,4.796875
3829617,5,B001Y8WB22,"I'm a musician, and Hiromi is one of those gifted few who appears to me to have superhuman ability in this field.  Coupled with her completely original approach, she is simply dazzling to watch and hear.  Certainly, her performances will not be everyone's cup of tea, but, even if what she achieves does not coincide with your musical tastes, you will be left stunned by the level of her work and wondering what she will achieve next.  Mesmerizing and inspiring.",1268092800,18,462,4.75
3829618,5,B001Y8WB22,"Wow! Where do I begin?! There's so much amazing stuff happening here!
  The concert starts out cool and sophisticated, but you may have to turn it up- for two reasons. Unless it was my player, it sounds as though it was recorded a little low. And secondly, this type of jazz, which I love, being predominantly ""fusion"" (in this case, a lethal combination of jazz and prog rock), should be played good and loud anyway, due to the peaks and valleys, the intense aggression, as well as gentle subtleties. The compositions here are great, covering a lot of ground.
  After awhile the cool, original style (and still the best) ""old school"" funk/fusion/rock makes way for more powerful intense, rhythmically complex music that's even hard to put a tag on! Sometimes Dave Fiuczynski's fretless guitar might not be for just any one's taste (at first), but on the lower neck of his double neck guitar, he plays amazingly. Later on, Dave uses the fretless much more creatively, and I especially liked it when he made it sound like a ""Koto"" in one particularly quiet part of the concert. But for the most part, (especially when Dave plays the fretted guitar), or does an incredible solo near the end through a ring modulator, he's superb, as is the rest of the band!
  Hiromi? Hiromi is absolutely relentless! Whenever you're pretty certain that the last mind-blowing solo has probably worn her out, plus what the hell is she going to do to keep up after one of the other guy's amazing solos? Well, there she goes again! Building to such intensity, with such physical energy that you think she's going to explode, or scream! Having said that, she'll also play gentle, melodic jazz on acoustic piano, or very cool Fender Rhodes-type grooves on one of her synths. Being a musician all my life, Hiromi reminds me exactly of the type of rare player that, when all the other musicians are just about ready to pass out (at an all-night jam session), she'll be wanting to go for another four or five hours, as though she's just getting warmed up! I don't know Hiromi, but I sure as hell know she lives and breathes, and ""is"" music!
  Of course we've all heard the saying, ""she's really good.... for a girl!"" Well, in this case, she's really brilliant, for a human being! Period!!",1259884800,27,2261,4.663316582914573
3829619,5,B001Y8WB22,"This is a really well done video documentation of a concert by an amazing group of musicians, but nothing beats seeing them live!  Check out Hiromi's tour schedule on her web site, and run, and grab some tickets to the show nearest you.  I saw them in May, 2009 in Boston, and am going again in July to see them in Manhattan.  Worth every penny!  (The DVD AND the concert!).",1246320000,,374,4.3

8347999,5,B001Y8WB22,"This is a good if no-frills DVD of one of Hiromi's better performances.  Amazingly it does not have ""Time Difference"" which is one of my favorites. I don't know why they included everything else from the concert except that one song.

The complete track list is:

1. Deep into the Night
2. Time and Space
3. Time Control, or Controlled by Time
4. Time Travel
5. Note from the Past
6. Double Personality
7. Time Out
8. Return of the Kung-fu World Champion.

Hiromi has a very different sound in the studio compared to live material, so make sure you check out some of her live stuff on YouTube first.",1483488000,,599,4.418181818181818

8348001,4,B001Y8WB22,"It's very entertaining to to watch this female pianist play at a very fast tempo, jumping up with a
big smile on her face. The music is a jazz rock that display some pure jazz passages with some more
rock oriented music. Each musician at some point show some impressive skill with some groovy
rhythms, especially David Fiuczynski on the twelve strings guitar. All the songs are above the ten
minutes mark delivering some furious rock passages that are mixed with some more relaxed and jazz
ones. But what's the difference between this kind of jazz and others jazz rock ensemble is the fast
moving play of Hiromi Uehra who let us speechless with her talent and how every notes comes out easily.",1433116800,3,693,4.642276422764228

8348004,5,B001Y8WB22,Hiromi is one of the major forces in jazz and this video shows why. It is a great concert. If you are a fan I highly recommend this video and if do not know of Hiromi I recommend this video as you do not know what you are missing.,1380844800,,230,3.7142857142857144
