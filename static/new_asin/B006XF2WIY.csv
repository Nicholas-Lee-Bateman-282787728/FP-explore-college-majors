8506318,5,B006XF2WIY,"""No Subtitles Necessary"" tells the story of two young Eastern European film school students--Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond-- who came to America with no money, jobs, or prospects and changed the look and feel of American cinema.  A fine cinematographer himself, James Chressanthis has directed a first-rate documentary and made an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the history of cinema.  Not to be missed by anyone who cares about movies.",1409875200,2,457,5.422535211267606

8506320,5,B006XF2WIY,"First off... this documentary succeeds on many levels. If you are a film fan...these two directors of photography have been responsible for dozens and dozens of classic and genre defining films from the 60's on.  The story of their life long friendship and their escape from Hungary in 1956 is heart warming and I really don't want to go into too much of it for fear of spoiling the story.  Suffice to say this documentary had me from start to finish!  Well filmed with many interesting bits from their films and many wonderful contributions by directors,actors and other photographers. For me the extra fun is the bonus features.  When people contribute to such a documentary they may only be on the ultimate product for a few minutes or seconds here and there but they may have sat for much longer and contributed much more which is interesting but the film has to have an end!  I really appreciate when producers of documentaries and films go to the trouble to present a lot of that ""extra"" footage and they have on this superlative package.

As a story of lifelong friends this is a winner, as a story of artists who were at the dawn of the changing cinema from the studio system to the independent world of film making in the 60's this is a winner.",1333843200,8,1253,4.546666666666667
