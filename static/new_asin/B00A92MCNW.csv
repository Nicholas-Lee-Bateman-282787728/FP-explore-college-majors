Hard to get the voices, even for the good of hearing.",1366156800,3,134,4.869565217391305
5401196,2,B00A92MCNW,"I was very disappointed that it did not have closed captions. After about 15 minutes trying to understand what the actors were saying I put the DVDs away. For elderly persons who are hard of hearing, it was a waste of money.",1362873600,36,224,4.357142857142857
5401197,5,B00A92MCNW,"RC has said it was one of his favourite miniseres, his acting is good and he ages very well in it!",1362873600,,98,3.7142857142857144
5401198,4,B00A92MCNW,"TV used to be full of wonderful mini-series and movies but seldom are they ever seen anymore on any television station. Thank goodness for Amazon where these movies and mini-series can now be purchased and enjoyed by those of us who loathe the influx of reality shows on the major networks. I had all but forgotten this particular mini-series but thankfully, Amazon suggested it for me based on others purchased. The on-location scenery of Dream West was breathtaking and I especially enjoyed the scenes from the ill-advised expedition during the winter time.",1362268800,14,559,5.086956521739131
5401199,5,B00A92MCNW,"I've been waiting for this mini-series to come out on DVD for years.  The story of John C. Fremont is well told and chronicles his explorations and mapping of the American West.  Alice Krige does a wonderful job of portraying Fremont's strong-willed wife and the cast is stellar.  The picture quality is very good considering this was televised almost 30 years ago.  I never could figure out why it hasn't been shown again and why it took so darned long to come out in DVD format.  Even though this is no ""Centennial"" or ""The Thorn Birds"", Richard Chamberlain does a very good job as Fremont in this lesser known miniseries.  Well worth purchasing--however, you might want to shop around for a better price.  I got mine through WB Archives at a more reasonable price than I see listed here.",1361404800,39,790,4.640287769784172
5401200,5,B00A92MCNW,I was very pleased with this movie - I saw it years ago on TV and have always wanted to buy a copy.  The movie arrived in excellent condition and was shipped quickly.

5401230,5,B00A92MCNW,"This three part miniseries aired thirty years ago in 1986 and was never shown again even in syndication. Gorgeous photography, a great cast and almost all of John C. Fremont's life shown with just a few inaccuracies to make it a very entertaining story.",1457827200,,253,4.7727272727272725
5401231,2,B00A92MCNW,"Disappointed in this miniseries. I was hoping for something that gave you a real feel for a historical time and with well  written drama. Maybe similar to the Last Place on Earth which deals with the exploration of the South Pole by Amundsen and Scott. To me, this series was basically a made for TV hollywood soap opera. The first episode hints at important, groundbreaking work in exploration and map making, but does not even devote one scene to these topics. The vast majority of the episode concerns the tedious and very trite courtship between Fremont and a senator's daughter. I gave up on it after the first episode.",1451606400,,624,4.724770642201835

5401248,5,B00A92MCNW,Learned alot about Mr. Fremont.  Showed his accomplishments as well as his flaws. Great acting...Beautiful scenery.  I was glad to add it to my DVD collection.,1428451200,,159,5.076923076923077
5401249,3,B00A92MCNW,"an interesting story. However, it came with three discs. The middle disc was blank.

It was OK except for the missing middle part.

I wish you would have the PARADISE  western with Lee Horsley. It was on TV for three years, I think. Horsley is a wonderful actor. In the show, he is a has to take care of four children while fighting many battles. The chiildren came into life when his sister dies.

At some point the name PARADISE was changed to  GUNS OF PARADISE.

PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT IT. A GREAT SHOW. Note: You have a Paradise show not, but it is not this western.",1428019200,2,569,4.222222222222222

5401271,5,B00A92MCNW,Epic miniseries about American John Charles Fremont and his dream for Young America. I saw this miniseries many years ago and am so glad that it is now available on DVD. History buffs will enjoy it and movie lovers should clamor to add this one to their libraries. I received my copy from Amazon yesterday and watched the entire miniseries last night. It just draws you in,1423612800,6,372,4.567164179104478

5401276,5,B00A92MCNW,"Richard Chamberlain is one of my favs and this series does not disappoint. It was new to me and glad I found it. The producers of this production didn't try to get by on cheap. From the costumes, makeup, location, authentic articles, this is a top notch series. Long, yes. That is necessary to tell the full story. Unfortunately, Freemont isn't an explorer/person many people remember from their school studies..or even taught now. So much history I am looking up as I didn't know took place with Texas and California. Twists and turns of politics.",1420070400,5,548,4.778947368421052

5401278,4,B00A92MCNW,"I really enjoyed this mini -series.  Richard Chamberlain  with his usual superb acting and an excellent cast (except for the man that played Abraham Lincoln, whom I didn't like). I knew little about John Freemont and found it  a real treat.",1415750400,,240,4.804878048780488
5401290,4,B00A92MCNW,"I will be ordering soon, I remember seeing part of it as a kid. My husband was an extra in it, I can't wait to see the rest of the series, and to see if I can pick him out of the extras, since it was cut short back then..",1415145600,,221,3.44

5401299,5,B00A92MCNW,THIS WAS A WONDERFUL ADAPTION OF AN INTERESTING BOOK ABOUT A MAN WHO HELPED OPEN UP THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO IMMIGRATE TO OREGON AND CALIFORNIA AND REALLY ISN'T AS WELL KNOWN AS HE SHOULD BE IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS.  J. C. FREMONT WAS A VERY INTERESTING MAN AND IT WAS FUN TO WATCH RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN BRING HIM TO LIFE.,1393632000,8,351,4.318181818181818
5401310,5,B00A92MCNW,"It was wonderful. Sound and color very good.  Actors great, story line flowed, learned history that I had forgotten about or never knew.

5401312,3,B00A92MCNW,"Not near as good as Richard Chamberlain in Cenntenial. The Dream West story was a little slow and the transfer is a 3.5 out of 5. Not worth the price of 25.00. It has good moments, but I was expecting more....support your favorite artists",1378252800,5,238,4.431818181818182
5401313,3,B00A92MCNW,I expected more about I john Fremont adventures.  There was not enough  story about Kit Carson and his personal life,1377820800,2,116,4.75
5401314,4,B00A92MCNW,First copy shipped had severe tracking error on second disk. Returned in exchage and second copy was fine. It is great to have this seldom aired mini-series available. Acting spotty but historically OK.,1377129600,2,202,5.151515151515151
5401315,3,B00A92MCNW,"I hadn't seen this mini series on Tv and was hoping for something worth watching like Hawkeye or maybe Dr Quinn, but it fell short of both.  It was okay, but you could tell it is an older film.  has some historical moments, if you are a history bluff.  Some swearing ruined it for me.  Anyway thought it would be better than it was.",1376265600,3,332,4.140625

5401318,5,B00A92MCNW,"I first read the bood ""Dream West"" and loved it.  Have always liked Richard Chamberlain, so decided to check this out.  Even though its very compressed from the book, it does follow it and  the cast does a great job; especially Chamberlain and Alice Krige.  If you like history about the settling of the West, check this out.",1367107200,,325,4.551724137931035

8548566,5,B00A92MCNW,This show is excellent. Whether you're a Richard Chamberlain fan or just a fan of Westerns! I happen to be both.
