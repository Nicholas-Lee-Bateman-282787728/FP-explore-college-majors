8542632,5,B009KTVVM8,"This is a fascinating story about the secret city that was built in collaboration with private industry so that the A-bomb could be fully developed. 92 year old H. Ford Whipple, now residing in Santa Rosa, CA (see my review of ""Operation Crossroads:the official pictorial records"" on Amazon books) worked as an employee of Union Carbide and Carbon Chemical Corporation which worked on a ""dollar a year contract"" with the Department of Defense (all expenses covered plus $1/year). The other corporations were Dupont and Tennessee Eastman (of Eastman Kodak). He lived in Sandusky Hall (barracks) and later in a D-House with 5 other engineers. In the movie, they show people standing in lines for rations, not knowing what was being handed out (since a lot of things were rationed). However, H. Ford Whipple never stood in line for cigarettes since he is a non-smoker and kept himself busy with basketball, baseball (hence the now sprightly 92 year young:)). He worked in the K-25 complex on the U-shaped in-line ""cascade"" -- separating the corrosive gas Uranium hexafluoride into U-235 and U-238. He found the movie very accurate and the story of this secret city well told. When he was hired, he was investigated by the FBI before getting the clearance. Needless to say, he could not tell his parents or friends (he was single then) about the nature of the work (""Loose lips sink ships"" -- there is an interesting poster of a watchful eye with a swastika in it exhorting people to maintain secrecy). To maintain secrecy, H. Ford Whipple got in trouble while at Columbia (before joining Oak Ridge, a name adapted later) when he was taking pictures with a fried while out at Fulton Street fish market in New York. When accosted by a guard for the shipping facility who asked them what they did, he answered, ""I can't tell you."" The guard proceeded to call the authorities and some agents (?FBI) showed up. Ford then provided the agents the number he had been given should he ever did get into such a pickle -- the agents called the number and let the two go, but not before confiscating their camera film.
The movie emphasizes how such a massive project was kept so secret -- even to the point of building a ""Secret City"".",1353628800,2,2219,4.751295336787565
