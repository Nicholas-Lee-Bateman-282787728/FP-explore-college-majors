2004154,5,B0001I54U2,"Far more fully realized than the Tarantino films that it in part inspired, Lady Snowblood is all about revenge. Nothing else. In fact, Yume (Japanese for snow) is born for revenge in a prison hellhole; her only reason for living is to reap revenge for crimes against her mother, who died shortly after childbirth. Fitting to its grave theme, the film builds a somber gray world that M-TV fans might mistake for dullness. For a moment, some small light is permitted into this world, but, as you must know they will, duty and fate prevail. When the theme so familiar from the Tarantino film plays on this film's soundtrack, this time you will *feel* it!",1090972800,4,651,4.6695652173913045
2004155,3,B0001I54U2,"I'm sure that others beside myself will be interested in this film because both the theme song and the basic story of a lone woman out for bloody revenge were borrowed for Tarantino's Kill Bill. Although the story here is basically a good one and parts of the film are beautiful, overall it lacks momentum and suspense, and by the end it degenerates into a silly final showdown. This is a pity, because ""Lady Snowblood"" easily could have been an interesting contribution to the samurai classics. So, even though the subtitles are great and the actress who plays Lady Snowblood is both beautiful and fierce, the script in the end doesn't do her justice.",1090368000,15,652,4.728070175438597
2004156,4,B0001I54U2,"I, a huge fan of asian cinema loved this movie. It is definately one of the best asian movies and it is great. It is artistic and dreamy. It is a blood-soaked, beautiful revenge story, and it is great. I can see why quentin tarantino used it as inspiration for another one of my favorite movies KILL BILL!",1088726400,4,305,4.275862068965517
2004157,5,B0001I54U2,"I really must congratulate the producers of this DVD. The subtitles of most of the asian films that I've seen are definitely their weakest point.  On this one, however, not only is the film transfer & sound amazingly good, but the subtitles are also nothing short of fabulous; with none of the usual gaffs, but more importantly with a genuine artistic sense of the use of language. Plus there are two 'levels' of subtitle available, one with additional context.

There are enough other reviews here I don't feel that it is necisary to go into to much depth about the story of the film, but I'll just close by noting that this film has the kind of silly blood special effect successfully mocked in Monty Python's ""Salad Days"". Apparently these victims of the sword have such enormous blood pressure that they spout great arcs of the stuff at the merest scratch.  Don't let this aside deter you from checking out this excellent film.  If you at all a fan of Japanese Action Movies, this one will not disappoint.",1085961600,15,1009,4.651685393258427

*Plot and ending analyzed*

I guess if you have the brain of a gerbil and chew sugar candy all day, this film should fit your bill just fine. Others might want a little more in the way of a coherent story. There are parts of Lady Snowblood that are atmospheric and colorful, but the idea is not handled with enough competency, or even concern.

Lady Snowblood is some dull, waif of a woman, who has a feeble umbrella sword, whom she uses to chop in half corpulent bodies, hands, limbs and heads. Okay. The enemies are as imbecilic as the premise, even unable to fight such a woman. They just sit by and wait to be ""chopped up"". I must admit that the high reviews made me think these films would rate as high as Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman or Lone Wolf and Cub, but they are nowhere near as great.

2004187,5,B0001I54U2,"Lady Snowblood is so much more than Kill Bill. Despite the fact that Kill Bill's imagery is inspired by this and other Japanese films of the era, and despite both films being fun for the most part, try as they might, they fail to capture the poetry of these Japanese classics that give the violence an ironic backdrop that few scripts can deliver. We are talking Citizen Kane material here, or close to it, though of course in it's own way.
 Likewise, there is a grace about Lady Snowblood that is lost upon the imagination of the western female mind. I believe ""Pussy Wagon"" says it all, to keep an elaborate explanation short. I highly doubt the hard core fans of this old film during it's time would have the desire to watch something like Kill Bill as I'm sure, once again, they'd be seeking something with a bit more depth, grace, and spirit such as The Blind Swordsman, or Shogun Assassin.

2004205,2,B0001I54U2,"After only viewing part of the movie back when I was a teen, I recently watched the movie in its entirety. Although better than the Kill Bill of Tarantino, I find this movie lacking the sufficient dialogue I have enjoyed in many of the better `'Japanploitaton'' movie of the decades past. The dialogue came about as if the writing was rushed. There were opportunities for the writer to investigate the sub text and themes that he scratched at in the script (sexual violence, paradigm shift, corruption, political oppression). Continuing, the plot was uninteresting, and the acting was subpar (the lady was very pretty though), the direction was awkward, and the fight scenes (which you would think would be the highlight of the film) tacky and unfulfilling. All the great fight scenes in the classic martial art action movies are supposed to act as a catharsis, an emotional release for the characters as well as the viewers. This film misses that point completely. There is even a last ditch effort to add emotional weight to the final scenes of the film by making the male leads  son  to the antagonist, the man she most wants to kill (don't worry that's not a spoiler because when it is revealed you don't feel surprised). I definitely won't be watching any of the films that make up the rest of the series, just another over rated flick in my opinion, probably victim to genre lovers tunnel vision and sentimentality of the subject matter. If you choose not to watch this movie you will not be missing anything, just the hype that surrounds it.",1235692800,,1548,4.75092936802974

2004208,5,B0001I54U2,Brutal and graphic.  The origin of Lady Snowblood and the horrors she suffers made this character into a killing machine of vengeance.  One of the best vengeance type samurai movie ever made. This is the way a revenge movie should be made.  It's no wonder this movie helped inspire Quinton Tarantino's Kill Bill.  Watch it and see why,1175731200,,334,4.706896551724138
2004209,5,B0001I54U2,"First off, here's a flat-out comparison between the two films.  From my perspective, Shurayukihime 1 and 2 are both excellent, but they are quite a bit different.  Logically, I saw Shurayukihime 1 first, and I was quite pleased.  The movie was fairly fast paced, and a great plot, but still, there were a few places where it slowed down, which I didn't mind, but some people aren't very fond of it.

A few days later, I watched Shurayukihime 2, which, wasn't at all what I was expecting, but I was very pleased nonetheless.  Without giving too much away, Shurayukihime 2 has a very interesting political twist, which, at first, I kind of scratched my head wondering why the sudden change from bloody revenge in the first?  But as it continued, I found myself enjoying the second more kind of for it's ""what?"" twists and turns; Shurayukihime 2 also seemed a bit more evenly paced than the first as well.

Now, for those of you wanting to know about this vs. Kill Bill.  Though there are some definite elements that Tarantino borrowed, DO NOT watch Shurayukihime 1 or 2, especially 2, and expect to see ""The Original Kill Bill,"" THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET.  The films are completely separate.  Personally, I prefer Kill Bill for it's more in-depth development, and modern over-the-top filming, but Shurayukihime 1 and 2 are more of the entertaining 70's Japanese films category.  Another thing that I would note is that the fight scenes and bloodshed are not as much as Kill Bill either, these films are more revenge driven, than action driven, although, Shurayukihime 2 had a few moments in which I cringed.

I don't think I did a very good job selling it, but I enjoyed it, so, thus the review.

As for the Boxset, I think that it is worth is, you get 2 in one, though there is nothing special about the layout (ex. no bonus disk), it is nice to have them together, and at the time of my purchase, it was a better deal to get both together.",1170720000,2,1943,4.532951289398281
2004210,4,B0001I54U2,"Born in a filthy Japanese prison of the 19th century, a girl is raised to exact vengeance for the murder of her father and the rape of her mother.  A harsh priest trains her to be a lethal combatant, and she spends her life hunting the band of criminals.

Although revenge may be one of the basest human motivations, a movie like ""Lady Snowblood"" reveals its seductive nature as well, because director Toshiya Fujita understands how satisfying it can be to watch an implacable agent of destruction track down and annihilate a richly deserving target.  Meiko Kaji embodies the steely heroine convincingly as she dispatches her victims in exuberant sprays of blood.  Gory, but fun.",1160784000,,679,4.878260869565217
2004211,4,B0001I54U2,"I viewed ""Shurayukihime"" (""Lady Snowblood"" in the U.S. and ""Lady Snowblood: Blizzard from the Netherworld"" in the U.K.), after I read all four volumes of the manga by writer Kazuo Koike and artist Kazuo Kamimura.  You would think that I came to the film from hearing that it is one of the main inspirations for Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies (both film's offer ""Battle Without Honor or Humanity"" by Tomoyasu Hotei on their soundtracks), but having read Koike's epic ""Lone Wolf & Cub,"" and his ""Samurai Executioner"" manga, I was looking for anything else I could get my hands on even if it was not drawn by Goseki Kojima (and even if I had to read it right-to-left).  The first volume of ""Path of the Assassin"" was not out yet, but most of the four volumes of ""Lady Snowblood"" were already available, so I went that route.

The manga started being published in 1972 and the movie came out in 1973, so they are somewhat contemporaneous.  The script for the film was written by Koike and Kazuo Uemura (the latter's only movie credit), and while the situation is the same for Yuki Kashima (Meiko Kaji), the story is different.  Before she was born her parents and brother became victims of a scam being worked by a quartet of criminals.  Yuki's father and brother were murdered, and her mother raped.  Yuki's mother tracks down and kills one of the four before she is caught and imprisoned for life.  There she seduced every man she could find to become pregnant and give birth to a child of ""syura"" (""hell"") that would be raised in the world and give her vengeance over the three remaining criminals.

The manga is different from the film version of ""Lady Snowblood"" in two important ways.  First, the manga has a lot more nudity and sex, especially since Yuki often ends up naked when she is using her thin sword that comes from the handle of her umbrella.  Second, Lady Snowblood is often more elegant in how she accomplishes her missions.  In the movie that means geysers of bright red blood, but in the manga there was a bit more creativity to how Yuki claims her victims.  Here it is all about slicing and dicing.  There are three people Yuki has to kill and she kills them to fulfill her blood oath.  There are trials and tribulations along the way and you can tell how things are going by how big Yuki's eyes get.

Of course I think the manga is better because there is a lot more character development than you get in the movie, but ""Shurayukihime"" is pretty good for a Japanese revenge drama.  You get the back story fleshed out in the film, incorporating more of the manga in that regard than with the actual killing of Lady Snowblood's three targets.  Having a female in the lead role lends a different dynamic to the events, and her thin little sword even gives the fights a different look as well (but not in a delicate way).  I do not end up recommending which of the two between the manga and the movie you should go with first, because I think it works either way.  However, I will warn you that the cinematic sequel, 1974's ""Shurayukihime: Urami Renga,"" is a disappointment because beyond some nifty tracking shots for a couple of fights, our heroine is passive and uninspired.",1153008000,4,3199,4.5691768826619965
2004212,4,B0001I54U2,"Quentin Tarantino owes a lot more to this movie
than a passing reference of ""inspiration.""
""Lady Snowblood"" not only inspired Kill Bill,
but it also served as the complete schematic blueprint for
both Volumes I & II. While Tarantino claims that
Volume I was based on a story by him and Uma Thurman,
I suspect their collaboration would have come across
totally different on screen if ""Lady Snowblood""
had never existed.

With that being said,
I absolutely loved this movie.
However, I would advise anyone who hasn't yet
viewed the film to completely forget about
it's connection to Kill Bill. If you concentrate on
similiarites, you'll most likey
be disappointed. First of all, I wouldn't really
considered this an action film at all. Although
the main character is a vengeful martial artist,
there is less action in this film than you'd ever
believe. The main theme of the film is the relationship
between Revenge and Fate, and the resulting effects.
Most of the film is reflection and contemplation on
the part of Lady Snowblood.

But what a beautiful character Shurayuki is! The close-ups
of her face while she's in a state of enraged numbness
are breathtaking.  Since I'm an avid martial arts fan
I would've loved to have seen more (or even better) fight
sequences, but this is such a great film, it's easy
to be satisfied with the film as it is.

I think it would be best to classify this as a Dramatic Action
movie. For all those who have already seen the Kill Bill volumes and
are expecting any similarites beyond the plot basis,
you'll be sorely disappointed. The action and special
effects in ""Lady Snowblood"" are pre-school antics compared
to Kill Bill.  However, this movie is by no means a waste of time.
In fact, the lead role in this film is the prototype for the
emotionless, lone female assasin of countless other films.
Regardless of how successful the Kill Bill volumes were at the box
office, neither of them holds a candle to the way that
Meiko Kaji incarnates this role of Lady Snowblood. Not only is she
convincing, but she seductively compels the viewer to justify her vengeance.

Don't miss this film, but please appreciate it for being
a great movie and not just an ""inspiration""
for Kill Bill.",1152576000,9,2218,4.748051948051948
2004213,4,B0001I54U2,"The only thing that was ridiculous about this film was how nobody just bleeds when they are cut.  Blood actually sprays all over the place.  I've heard of being under alot of stress, but this film gives ""being under alot of pressure"" a whole new meaning.  So this is why they spray instead of just bleed like the rest of us.

I would imagine that they probably do some pretty intense farts too.",1151020800,,394,4.3561643835616435
2004214,5,B0001I54U2,"It is the late 1800s; the scene is set for a tragedy of staggering proportions when a child is conceived in a brutal Japanese jail for one purpose and one purpose alone.  This child is born to the Lady Sayo; a woman held in prison for murder, her daughter's name will be Yuki, or Lady Snowblood, bringer of vengeance.

Sayo dies during childbirth but she leaves precise instructions on how Yuki is to be raised, and many years later a beautiful young woman sets out to complete what her mother failed to do, wipe out the people that slaughtered her family, and do it in such a way that no one will ever forget the name of Lady Snowblood.

Get ready for a roller coaster ride of extreme sword play, brutality and carnage that will make your head spin and your eyes come out on stalks.

This film should be dated by now, after all it was made in the early 1970s but there is something timeless about it, and we all know it was used as a template for the highly successful trilogy of Kill Bill.

Stomach churning in parts, you will be glued to your seat when you watch this movie, not for the faint hearted but well worth watching even though it is over 30 years old.",1149897600,2,1164,4.2727272727272725
2004215,5,B0001I54U2,"Anyone who is a fan of Kill Bill must see this movie.  Kill Bill is not a remake, but it was inspired by this movie, and seeing this movie gives a different perspective on Kill Bill (the significance of the fight in snow, for instance).  It is also a great movie in its own right, with some quite different plot twists to Kill Bill and some insights into Japanese history to boot.  Highly recommended.",1124928000,,401,4.391891891891892
2004216,4,B0001I54U2,"This movie is interesting on two levels.  First is the obvious - Tarantino was inspired by it to create Kill Bill.  The differences are many, but the inspiration is clear.  The second is this an early 1970s transcription of Manga (comic book) killer to big screen.  Given the emerging popularity of Manga and Anime (Japanese animation) in the West, we will be seeing a lot more of this.

To take the movie as a deep analysis of revenge is a little too much.  It is much easier to view it as a slightly campy and thoroughly violent story of revenge, and ultimately justice.  Somehow the more seriously the story of ""this child from the netherworld"" is told, the more darkly humorous it becomes.  The more over the top the violence, the less sickening it becomes.

In the end, the movie is enjoyable and entertaining, if not high art.",1115596800,3,832,4.5675675675675675
2004217,4,B0001I54U2,"I'll be honest, I rented this film strictly because I love Kill Bill and I was curious to see where Tarantino culled his imagery and ideas. I'm very glad I did, and it's why I think Kill Bill is a very important bridge between modern cinema and cult and foreign film that, lets face it, most of us miss out on. This film is a very beautiful and poetic look at revenge and love. The title character, Yuki, is born into and raised with a single ideology, vengeance. She knows no love, except for that of her deceased parents and brother, nor hate, except for her enemies who killed her father and brother and tortured her mother. The film follows Yuki on her journey to find and enact her vengeance on these four villains. Though the plot is fairly simple, it's well crafted and manages to sidestep what could be easy static characterization for very well drawn character arcs. The action and swordplay are beautiful and wonderfully over the top, as are the settings, story devices (like the use of paintings and manga to depict flashback and plot explanation), and special FX (lots of arterial blood sprays.) For fans of Kill Bill, this film is the basis for the O-Ren Ishii character. Other references are similar settings (the fight at the end of the House of Blue Leaves sequence), numbered chapters, music, the afore mentioned arterial blood sprays, very similar character development, freeze frames with character identification, a very similar rouges gallery upward camera shot, and a mixture of live action and animation/manga.",1112572800,21,1533,4.832699619771863

DVD
1973

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars; subtitles/translation = 3.5 stars; cinematography = three (3) stars; choreography = three (3) stars; music = 2.5 stars; splatter/spurting effects = two (2) stars.  Director Toshiya Fujita and Principal Producer Kikumaru Okuda deliver a four chapter film adaption of a popular contemporary manga (comic book / graphical novel) which chronically reminds the viewer of it's original source material.  A live action manga complete with over-the-top accesses that characterize the genre.  This is a tale of supposed enhanced suppression of the under classes by the top one percenters during the first few decades of the Meiji emperorship.  After undergoing 20 years of mostly sadistic training (including being rolled repeatedly down a hill in a barrel while still a child!), the leading protagonist sets out to exterminate four villains (one in each movie chapter) who destroyed her late mother's life.  The film is loaded with expository voice over (more like listening to an audio book than watching a movie) suggesting (a) a lack of ideas about filmic adaption and/or (b) insufficient production financing.  Acting is pretty hammy all round.  Leading actress Meiko Kaji seems to do more sword-swinging posing (and posing in general) than line deliveries (she looks stunning when favorably costumed and lit, but has little to say compared to other cast members and appears a bit bored (or unhappy?) with her role.  She also sings the opening/closing theme song (which is translated--a rarity!).  Choreography is okay but a bit dragged out due to extensive inserting of Kaji-posing shots.  Blood spurting (especially during sword fights) is strictly comic-book style - it looks like each of the wounded suffers from off-the-scale high blood pressure and is on the verge of blowing up due to gallons of excess blood!  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and lighting are fine.  Subtitles/translations are very good with all singing, signage, and written text translated.  Music is contemporary (it often sounds like a rift on Italian spaghetti westerns of the time) and does not fit well with the time period of the film (late 1800s).  Restoration is outstanding.  An interesting organic cartoon.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1482710400,,2463,5.345454545454546

Lady Snowblood is some dull, waif of a woman, who has a feeble umbrella sword, whom she uses to chop in half corpulent bodies, hands, limbs and heads. Okay. The enemies are as imbecilic as the premise, even unable to fight such a woman. They just sit by and wait to be ""chopped up"". I must admit that the high reviews made me think these films would rate as high as Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman or Lone Wolf and Cub, but they are nowhere near as great.

Still, they are worth a look for the time.",1468972800,,884,4.275449101796407
