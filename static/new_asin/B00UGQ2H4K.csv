8706231,2,B00UGQ2H4K,"College professor becomes an undercover agent during WWII working in Switzerland and Italy behind German lines to thwart the Germans attempt at creating an atom bomb. Succeeds in handling weapons and in hand-to-hand combat with veteran enemy agents. Theres more romance between Cooper and Palmer in this film than there is action. The movie drags at times, and its only serviceable as a film noir/war picture. Watch if you're desperate.",1510358400,,436,5.242857142857143
