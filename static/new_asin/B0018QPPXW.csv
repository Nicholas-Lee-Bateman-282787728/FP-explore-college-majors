3418582,5,B0018QPPXW,"My son treated me to this movie shortly after it was released. He proudly informed me that since he looked something like the kid in the film, he could become a movie star too. For weeks, he slid across the kitchen floor in his socks, laughing.
He was killed in a hiking accident later that year. Every time Cruise makes a movie, I buy it, because he so makes me think of Steve.
His films are very good, this one and The Last Samauri being my favorites.",1307664000,5,453,4.218390804597701
3418583,4,B0018QPPXW,"Risky Business is the film that made Tom Cruise a star. Underneath his good looks and charming personality - Cruise is a talented actor. Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay had wonderul, intense chemistry and love that scene when they are on the subway train! The film is a bit dated now but it's still loads of fun. Check it out!",1280102400,2,323,4.4
3418584,2,B0018QPPXW,"The young Tom Cruise stars in this fantasy about a teenager in the Chicago suburbs setting up a temporary brothel in his home when his parents take a few days in Florida. Cruise is fine and gets to do an air guitar dance in his underwear -- but the movie seems awfully dated. Rebecca de Mornay is the young whore with a heart of gold. There's a cute car chase and a nice scene with Dad's Porsche going into Lake Michigan but much of the rest is slightly yucky. This movie came out when the big AIDS explosion was taking place -- but you'd never guess from watching this. Some of the interplay between Cruise and his parents recalls The Graduate but without the bite of that classic. There is also a character called Guido, a mafiosi type who seems like an incredibly gentle gangster to audiences that have become familiar with the brutality of The Sopranos. (I think the same actor later met a grisly fate in that series).",1245110400,4,922,4.429411764705883

3418586,3,B0018QPPXW,"""Risky Business"" seems to be making a gentle crack at the corrupt and materialistic adult world. Tom Cruise plays a high school kid and reluctant ""future enterpriser"" who sets up a bordello in his parent's house while they are away on holiday. His materialistic parents seem more interested in their stereo, Porsche, holidays, and what college their son gets into rather than the feelings of their own son. The pre-AIDS sexual zeitgeist date the film somewhat but Cruise's star quality is plain for all to see. He turns the film into something far better than it deserves.",1233187200,2,572,4.907216494845361
3418587,5,B0018QPPXW,"One of the real gems of this new 25th Anniversary DVD set is ""The Dream is Always the Same"": The Story of Risky Business. This documentary provides great insight into all the hurdles Risky Business encountered on its way to the silver screen, with interviews with all the main cast members and Paul Brickman.

The other great addition to this 80's classic is the original ending that Paul Brickman wanted the audience to see in the film.  The original ending, as shot by Brickman, had Joel Goodsen being shown as the strong one and Lana the weak one.  However, the studios wanted a happier ending and changed it before it was sent to theaters.",1221177600,4,643,4.62280701754386
3418588,5,B0018QPPXW,"Risky Business is a fantastic movie, much more complex than the standard teen fare at the time.  Great music by Tangerine Dream (written especially for the movie) and strong performances from its young cast, most notably a nineteen year old Tom Cruise and twenty four year old Rebecca De Mornay.  (Small side note:  Cruise and De Mornay lived together for over two years after making the movie, so the chemistry on-screen must have been pretty real!)

The original end of the movie was much darker than the happy, everything turns out okay version that was released.  Both versions were filmed and shown to a test audience, which preferred the happier, lighter version.  The original has (to my knowledge) never been released in any form, and I was concerned that it had been lost.

I'm very happy to report that this 25th anniversary release is planned to include a new making-of documentary along with the alternate ending and commentary by Tom Cruise, director Paul Brickman, and producer Jon Avnet.

So, it appears that this is what Risky Business fans have been waiting since 1983 to see!  The DVD is scheduled for release on September 16th, so we'll have to wait just a little longer.  Keep in mind also that while the press information is normally correct, all of it is subject to change prior to release.  But, it certainly looks very promising.

3418628,3,B0018QPPXW,"This was a '80's classic dark comedy filled with adult sexy humor.  Tom Cruise plays teenager Joel Goodsen whose parents are going to Florida for a week and is being left home alone.  Acting boldly he calls a call girl number.  Rebecca De Mornay shows up and everything gets out of hand.  He has trouble with her pimp ""Guido"" (Joe Pantoliao), dumps his father's Porsche into Lake Michigan and ends up with a wild night of prostitutes and high school boys in his home.  An over the top adult comedy, geared for teenage boys, that was popular at the time.  While not really a great film and stretching all moral guidelines it is a entertaining piece of adult comedy and worth a watch.  The first choice for Joel was Timothy Hutton, but he turned it down.  Tom Hanks, John Cusack and Nicolas Cage all auditioned for the role.  For Lana, the prostitute, Kim Basinger turned it down and Diane Lane's father said no way.",1426982400,,914,4.524390243902439

RISKY BUSINESS also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 going on 11 years old in the 5th grade when this movie was theatrically released in the Summer of 1983 along with STAYING ALIVE, PRIVATE SCHOOL, VACATION, PSYCHO 2, etc.",1387497600,,550,4.729166666666667
3418651,4,B0018QPPXW,"What can I say about the film that made Tom Cruise a star and brought Bob Seeger back to the forefront of Rock n' Roll History by a silly lip-sinking impression and dance in one's underwear? This became the protoypical teenage angst movie with a genuine happy ending (Rebecca De Mornay, several years Tom's senior, became his real life lover during the filming)  Add a pulse quickening musical score (an almost haunting techno creation by the Japanese Synthesist, Tangerine Dream) and an improbable plot facing most High School Seniors (can I get into college and WHERE?)  Its all good fun until a chance meeting with a callgirl (De Mornay)  complicates Cruise's plans with a business offer of her own.  With the parents out of town for a weekend, Joel (Tom) takes the advice of one of his privileged pals (""F____"" it, just do it man!), casts caution aside and goes out on a limb (actually SEVERAL limbs) and gets mixed up with a seedy pimp, a college recruiter and pretty much every teenage boy from his school.....Tom cemented his role as a tentative teen teetering on the edge of independence while trying to do the sensible thing; he is charming, vulnerable and endearing in his evolution into young adulthood.  Rebecca De Mornay is perfect as the fallen angel--sexy, sweet but driven in her ambitions.  This movie is an incredible look back 30 years ago when most of us were struggling with GPA's and hopes of a college education--what it delivers is an education in the risky business of finding ourselves!",1387065600,3,1512,4.796153846153846

When this movie first came out I was a freshman in college so I could relate to the main characters sence of pressure.  Granted, I didn't have a killer pimp after me.",1341532800,,299,3.95

I wasn't wrong.  I purchased the movie for them as a Christmas gift, both students reported back how much they enjoyed it and how much their friends enjoyed seeing it at the Holiday special gatherings.  This is a great buy, an excellent movie.",1325980800,,409,4.638888888888889

3418675,4,B0018QPPXW,"Risky Business is a Tom Cruise classic film, which has a narrative that focuses on young men looking for thrills, as they approach adulthood. It is a promiscuous desire by Joel Goodson (Cruise) that exposes him to a world where every pleasure can be bought. Goodson at first enjoys all the spoils, but soon finds himself in over his head in a sleazy world, where fair play is an unknown rule. The movie has some memorable scenes, including Cruise's home alone dance to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" by Bob Seger.

3418676,5,B0018QPPXW,"This is one of those movies which you see once and remember for a long long time.  You will remember for the scenes, music, the one liners.

Tom Cruise is a smart kid who is trying to get into Ivy Schools at the same time has a fantasies which he wants to fulfill when his parents are gone away.  Fueled by ideas and suggestions from his nerdy friend - he finally takes the guts to call an escort home for some good times - the events that turn out takes interesting twists and turns.  The movie has some steamy scenes, brilliant music  ..  Tom Cruise is at his best - a 18 yr old, shy, smart kid

Overall - the movie is worth 98 minutes of your life

8270706,5,B0018QPPXW,"I didn't realize the epidemic of ridiculousness that 80's teens were getting away with the second their parents left home.  This was set a long ago time: before cell phones, before chronic obesity, before every female star had plastic surgery to look more like Barbie, and when smoking signified coolness, not villainy.

I'll admit, the only thing I knew about this movie going into it was the infamous underwear dance.  And yet, it's so much more.  Balki & Booger as the cool guy's best friends, running an impromptu pop up fundraising event with attractive new friends, and the moxie to do it getting him into a great college.  Sexy time with a new girlfriend with very suggestive train tunnel filming, while aboard the train.  After all that,  his mother's still disappointed with him in the end.

Going into it unknown, this was definitely a 80's style completely improbable, yet fun movie.",1509667200,,894,4.874172185430464
