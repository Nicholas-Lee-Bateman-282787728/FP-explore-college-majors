Why has it not changed to dvd/blue ray? What does it take for ""That"" guy to get off his lazy ass and change the format so us the buyers can get this movie or any movie that is still frozen in yesteryear? it really does not make any sense what so ever...",1431216000,,395,4.012658227848101

I think the idea for the movie was a good one, but they went a bit over the top with it and in my eyes made what could have been a good movie ended up being just plain stupid.  I can see kids liking it, but adults beware.  Not even Anne Archer and Brian Dennehy could save this one.",1266624000,,319,3.803030303030303
7832503,5,6302968038,Brian Dennehy rules as a middle-class suburbanite tired of the rat race who turns the world upside down. It's an outstanding comedy and a must see!!,1103760000,2,148,4.730769230769231
