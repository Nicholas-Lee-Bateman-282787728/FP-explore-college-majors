8273780,1,B0019ESNFA,"If you liked the original, which i did very much, you would just naturally wanna see more. Please, don't do it. Pretend it ends where it did. This sequel is worse than Creepshow 3, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium, and House 2: The Second Story. The runtime for this movie is very short, although it feels longer because it is that bad. This could have been done way better. Looks like the original 1982 version used better film and had a bigger budget than this 1993 sequel. This movie was made on a $300 budget looks like. I could go on and on.",1339459200,2,542,4.221153846153846
