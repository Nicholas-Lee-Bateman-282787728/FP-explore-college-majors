5893678,5,B00E6QHY9Y,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Jake and the Never Land Pirates and watch every episode that comes out. We have tons of episodes on our DVR and all of the toys.  The show is great for its fun characters, wonderful songs and great adventures. It always has a positive message and teaches kids valuable lessons in every episode.  My girls get really excited when each new episode comes out.

This DVD contains five great episodes from the Disney Junior series. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1. Never Land Rescue (Full Length Feature) - Never Land starts to disappear and Jake and crew must save it.
2. It's a Pirate Picnic / The Key to Skull Rock - Hook digs up the crew's picnic spot and the crew gets a key to a treasure.

5893704,5,B00E6QHY9Y,"My review of this DVD:
My son loves this show and this DVD is gonna be a huge hit for him when he gets it for Christmas. This one is a great movie of Jake and his friends, as they go on the quest to find new pixie dust, a map, and a sword.

Information from the DVD box:
Something strange is happening all over Never Land. All things magical are disappearing! First, Jake's sword vanishes, followed by Izzy's pixie dust - and even all the directions on Cubby's map fade away! Jake and his crew soon learn that this is all happening because the Forever Tree, the source of magic on Never Land, is old and dying. As the great tree withers, the magic will continue to disappear, until Never Land itself fades away! But there is hope.

Jake must go on the Forever Quest to get new pixie dust, a new map, and a new sword. All three items must be brought to the top of Mount Destiny by sundown, where they will help bring forth the new Forever Tree. The one who saves the magic of Never Land will receive some of the magic of the new tree, making them the most powerful pirate in all of Never Land! Of course, Captain Hook also wants this magic for himself - and he too takes on this great challenge. Despite the odds against Jake, our brave hero saves the magic, and brings forth the birth of a new Forever Tree! Yo ho, way to go, Jake!",1386460800,,1331,4.155038759689923
5893705,3,B00E6QHY9Y,"I'd never have bought this ""new"" video if I'd known Disney was already broadcasting it on their television network *before* it came out!  I found this out when my wife said ""we saw this a while ago"" as I was excitedly playing it for our daughter.  I could've DVR'd it and saved $14.98 (or whatever I paid).  It does make it more convenient to get a copy onto her tablet using commercial tools.",1386374400,,393,4.3561643835616435
5893706,5,B00E6QHY9Y,"Jake and Neverland Pirates DVD and all the products are great. My grandson loves them. I have almost bought it all,",1385510400,2,115,4.523809523809524
5893707,4,B00E6QHY9Y,"This special edition of the popular Disney Junior series, the equivalent of four individual stories on the daily show, marks the first appearance of Tinker Bell in this particular Peter Pan universe.

It begins as Jake joins his crew on the beach; where theyve set up a picnicof healthy, nutritious foodsand objects start disappearing. Jake learns that he alone must go on a quest to find the Forever Tree and get the Destiny Sword from Destiny Mountain.

The storyline is secondary to the fact that, all the while, Jake is helped by the Guardian of Never Land, whose disguise only obscures him partially, making it pretty easy for little ones to figure out who it really is.

I just realized that this series interactive aspect, in young viewers are asked to participate as they watch, actually can be traced back to the famous scene J.M. Barries original 1904 play, when theater audiences were asked to clap to save Tinker Bell. So Dora and Blues Clues did not do it first! As far as I can remember, though, the idea that pixie dust stops working when it gets wet seems to have been invented for this series in order to give Captain Hook more ways to lose out in his schemes.

In addition to the extras on the disc listed below, theres a keen inflatable Sword of Destiny inside the package. This is very much like a toy I loved as a kid called Blimps. These were yellow plastic animal shapes that came in a cube with crayons and a straw. You could color the animals and use the straw to blow them up and play with themthe erase the crayons with a cloth. This sword has a little straw just like Blimps, only there are little stickers for decoration, which can be peeled off. So its the toy that keeps on giving! Nice.

5893708,5,B00E6QHY9Y,"My kids have always loved Jake and the Neverland Pirates and when they finally saw the direct connection between the original Peter Pan and their beloved show, they were hooked so to speak! Jake and the Never Land Pirates Never Land Rescue is now on constant repeat in my house.

The thing I have always loved about this show is that it really teaches kids the value of teamwork and working together. It also teaches grace and compassion when Jake and his friends don't give Captain Hook exactly what he deserves!

This DVD comes with a bonus sword and glow in the dark stickers which Paige immediately stuck all over the sword and turned off all the lights to watch it glow. They really love when DVDs come with these fun little bonuses.

Even though there are other episodes, my kids love Never Land Rescue to the most because of Peter Pan. They will watch the whole DVD and then ask to watch just that episode again!

Jake and the Never Land Pirates Never Land Rescue is a must have for any Jake fans!",1384905600,,1004,4.440217391304348
