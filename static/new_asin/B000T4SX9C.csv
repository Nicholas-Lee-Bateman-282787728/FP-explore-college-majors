8207742,5,B000T4SX9C,"I just finished watching John Bush's ""Dharma River,"" and I found it to be full of magnificent ancient sites, intriguing historical information, and small bits of deep wisdom.

John Bush narrates this film, himself, and his pleasant, matter-of-fact voice doesn't change whether he's describing a detail of history or some tasty morsel of deep wisdom from the tradition he's exploring. He also did his own filming, and--though sometimes you can tell when he moves a camera on a tripod, or when he's using a telephoto lens--he has a talent for setting the mood whether his subject is a group of joyous children, silent graceful waterways, or eerily deserted ancient ruins.

He visits Thailand, Burma and Laos.  Those latter two, Burma and Laos, must have taken some effort. I know of no other modern documentary of ancient Buddhist sites that managed to go where tourists were not (until recently) able to go. He talks a little about Burma's militant government, and an isolationist Laotian government.  But he neither dwells on it, nor passes judgement.  The only times he ""strays"" from the professional approach of a dispassionate, objective journalist is whenever he states his own discovered wisdom as fact.  But I hope that even non-Buddhists will agree that what he says makes a lot of sense.

I loved it!",1381363200,2,1308,5.0
8207743,5,B000T4SX9C,"Dharma River took me deep into the mystery and delight of SE Asian spirituality. Not only for Buddhists, this film will satisfy lovers of asian art and culture, as well as those who want to learn about Thailand, Laos and Burma before going or coming back. It is also a joy for the armchair mystic.

This film and the others of the trilogy are offered by the filmmaker as his own journey without the artifice and barrier of a large production crew ""on-set"". The fact that John Bush shot it himself and offers his voice as narrator gives a remarkable intimacy and ""you are there"" quality for those of us who go along with him to these many unforgettable destinations. The whole technique is transporting and immersive. To truly capture a profound sense of the sacred in this medium is rare and sublime.

Given our sad awareness about events in Burma these days, it was particularly gratifying to see his tender portrayal of the Burmese people at worship. The gilded architecture, countless Buddha images and the hypnotic music of these lands creates a magical sense of timelessness. Traveling on the rivers of SE Asia
as part of this pilgrimage was soothing and satisfying.

Once you hear the narration version you can then switch to the ambient soundtrack and the film becomes an extended sacred music video in 5.1 surround sound. You can also do the journey in stages rather than all at once.

This series is only for those who wish a meditative experience. It isn't your typical BBC type documentary.
But if you let go into it, you will be rewarded with your own inner pilgrimage as well.",1211760000,6,1589,4.684587813620071
8207744,5,B000T4SX9C,"The images of sacred sites are 5-star.  The naration is forgetabble.  I recommend this to Buddhists who want to see, not to people seeking teachings.",1203033600,12,149,4.92
8207745,5,B000T4SX9C,"Dharma River is a visually stunningly and informative documentary while providing a rare glimpse of a world seldom seen. Traveling by river to famous golden temples, Buddha caves, colorful villages and lost civilizations, I felt immersed in places I never knew existed. It was an enlightening journey.

I was also relieved to see that director John Bush presents Buddhism in a universal and essential way free from a sectarian point of view. He shares this more as an artist not as a spiritual teacher. It is also very inviting to people who are not Buddhist but interested in travel to these places. He portrays the spiritual cultures of Thailand, Laos and Burma as they are practiced by the people living there. Fascinating.

The timing of the film is a meditation. The director is obviously playing with a sense of time to induce a more intuitive and serene state and it works. The music is extraordinary and much of the local music I had never heard before but was happy to discover.

I highly recommend Dharma River and the entire trilogy of these films.",1193356800,11,1059,4.775956284153006
8207746,2,B000T4SX9C,"It's a shame.  I had such high hopes for this documentary but the pacing and sparse narrative makes it almost unwatchable.  The documentary makers also suffer from a strong Mahayana bias when discussing Buddhist philosophy-- mention Buddha-nature when discussing Burmese Buddhism?!?  I think not.  Alas, this film isn't worth your time.",1191369600,4,336,5.529411764705882
