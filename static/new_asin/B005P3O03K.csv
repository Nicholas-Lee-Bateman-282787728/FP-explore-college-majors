8482345,5,B005P3O03K,I love this DVD!  The Hawaiian music is just so beautiful and watching this festival brings back happy memories of when I lived in Hawaii.  The festival is held every year on the Big Island and you can clearly see how much the dancers enjoy the hula and have respect for its tradition in the Hawaiian culture. I hope to collect more of the Merrie Monarch Festival DVDs.,1352678400,,369,4.411764705882353
