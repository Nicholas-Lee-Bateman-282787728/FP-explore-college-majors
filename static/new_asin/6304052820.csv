7860231,5,6304052820,"Service was easy and delivered as stated in the advert. I'm so glad to have received this from London, as one cannot traditionally find it here in the States.  Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine) was one of the best mystery writers I've come across.  The recently late English writer had a knack of producing some of the most complex and psychological situations to solve.  A Dark Adapted Eye and Gallowglass are among my favourites.",1442188800,,429,4.77027027027027
7860232,5,6304052820,"The three movies are wonderful. A Dark Adapted Eye is the best in my opinion. Although I live in the U.S. - I was able to watch the DVDs because my personal computer would play them. SO, as it's been mentioned, these dvd's are for Region 2 and possibly 4. The U.S. is Region 1, so most normal U.S. dvd players will NOT play them. However, my personal computer played them fine, and without making any adjustments. If you're a fan of the author or these movies, I highly suggest ordering them, then play them on your personal computer.",1436572800,2,534,4.404040404040404

7860236,5,6304052820,"Adam Verne-Smith seems to have it all.  A well-off young executive with a pretty wife and adored baby daughter, he lives in a comfortable home in a London suburb.  But Adam is haunted by the events of a summer 11 years earlier, when he and a group of friends spent their vacation in an old mansion Adam had inherited.  The unfolding of those events, and the ramifications which they cause a decade later, ultimately lead Adam through a personal crisis which threatens everything.

A Fatal Inversion is based on the second Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell's alter ego) mystery.  It is a superbly told story with many surprises and red herrings, and this television version, first produced in Britain in the 1990s, is an excellent depiction. The actors, particularly Douglas Hodge and Jeremy Northam, are well chosen. Its a pity that it hasn't yet been released in DVD or Blu-Ray, as it is far superior to many lesser mysteries which have already been transferred.",1238544000,3,956,4.840490797546012
7860237,5,6304052820,"""A Fatal Inversion"" presents us with a mystery. The bones of a woman and child are  discovered in an animal cemetery near the stately Wyvis Hall. It turns out the bones have been there for more than ten years. But who was it that was buried there? And why?
Adam Verne-Smith is a man with a haunted past. He and three others know the truth of what happened in the summer of 1979 at Wyvis Hall, which Adam re-named Ecalpemos (""someplace"" spelt backwards). Adam and his arrogant friend Rufus meet again for the first time in twelve years, trying to keep one step ahead of the police to avoid the truth coming out. We go back in time twelve years to Wyvis Hall, and see how events built up to a crisis point.
I actually found this television adaptation was better than Ruth Rendell's novel. It was well-cast. Saira Todd was very good as the mentally-unbalanced Zosie. She looked child-like, as the book described her. Douglas Hodge and Jeremy Northam were also convincing with their roles. The character of Rufus was very intimidating and callous. Adam looked pained and guilt-ridden.
I noticed with the scenes set in the present that there was a lot of blue. Even the light had a bluish tinge. Is there any significance in that?
""A Fatal Inversion"" is different from your regular ""whodunnit"". We know who did the crime but not who the crime was done to. Right until the end we are left guessing. This is drama at its best.",973036800,26,1419,4.54296875
7860238,5,6304052820,"FROM THE OPENING SCENES TO THE POSITIVELY HAUNTING FINAL SHOT THIS FILM IS SO FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS IT IS IMPOSSBLE TO FALL ASLEEP!!! A STORY THAT WILL PLAY ON YOUR PSYCHE FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER, BUT YOU WILL DEFINATELY WANT  TO SEE IT AGAIN. AN INTELIGENT AND INTRICATE PLOT AND OUTSTANDING ACTING  FROM EVERY CAST MEMBER. A FLAULESS ADAPTATION OF AN AMAZING BOOK WITH NOT A  WEAK MOMENT IN SIGHT!!!!!",935798400,20,403,4.493150684931507
