4855378,1,B005OZJVE2,"Do not buy this.  The encoding, authoring, and manufacturing are all defective and apparently this company has never heard of quality assurance.  Most of the episodes freeze.  Many won't play at all.  The same thing, to varying degrees happens on several different (and different types of) players.  I literally haven't seen DVDs produced this badly since the 90s.  There is NO excuse for something of this (complete lack of) quality being produced this many years into the life-cycle of DVDs.  It doesn't matter if you like the show or not if you can't actually watch it.  Avoid this, and anything else produced by this company, and hope a real company can pick up the license at some point in the future.  Trust me, no matter how much you love it, it's not worth the frustration and wasted money.",1339804800,20,798,4.72463768115942
4855379,5,B005OZJVE2,"Skeleton Warriors was in my opinion an underrated animated series and wrongly seen as too scary for kids - not sure if that was the reason they ended it after just one season, but it would be a plausible explanation.

I got the set as I never got to watch the final episodes when I was a kid and wanted to see how it ends and I have to say it was worth waiting for.

While I was enjoying the show, I had a look at the region code for this set and was surprised to fin that it not only played on my multi-region DVD player but also on my DVD-ROM drive coded to Region 2. Further checks revealed that this set appears to be set to Region 0 - not sure if this was deliberate or a production error, I just thought I would let people know in case anyone is put off from buying the set as they cannot play back region 1 titles.",1335744000,,821,3.910179640718563

4855382,5,B005OZJVE2,I have tried these DVDs on an older DVD player and the Episodes on page 2 of the DVD wouldn't load Well I tested them on my DVD player on my computer My portable DVD Player My XBox and my other computer and they worked fine. These are not for Blu Ray Players or PS3 systems.,1327708800,17,274,3.9107142857142856
4855383,1,B005OZJVE2,"Although I do love the show, this gets one star because I am on my third one now. The first two had a disc two which loaded and started to play fine but disc one did not load at all. I waited on it and waited but I thought it was going to mess my DVD player up. I kept trying but no luck so I returned it...

Now the third try DOES NOT LOAD DISC ONE OR TWO! And as if that is not bad enought the booklet was damaged AND the cardboard outer case was not in this one. I would be willing to over look that if the DVDs worked but no luck there either.

I would either WAIT before buying and hope the errors are fixed, I mean you have waited this long so whats another year? OR do like I am doing and keep ordering and returning them when they don't work.

The worst part is when you call and get asked ""Well did you try ANOTHER DVD player?"" Come on guys!",1326153600,11,850,3.790960451977401
4855384,4,B005OZJVE2,"Skeleton Warriors follows the Legion of Light in their battles against the evil Skeleton Warriors.  It lasted for one season (13 episodes) and aired on CBS Saturday mornings in the early 1990s.  I've watched the entire set and didn't have any playability issues.  I did however notice in the episode ""Zara"" some pixelation and a loud popping noise a little before the 6 minute mark.  For only lasting one season, this set has some pretty good extras.  Two episodes have a commentary option and there is also a 30 minute documentary on the second disc.  The show itself hold ups pretty well.",1325548800,6,590,4.735294117647059

4855397,1,B005OZJVE2,"For some reason this show played for the first few episodes then froze, skipped, and never worked right, but the disks were brand new, so it was a very unfortunate waste of time and money, however, you could say that the fact the disks were defective saved me from wasting my time and money, because this show (what I was able to watch before it froze and skipped) was very boring, uninteresting, and just plain bland, bone dry (all pun intended!). I do not recommend, if for no other reason, save your money and time on not having to return bad DVD's!

Skeleton Warriors: The Complete Series ZERO STARS out of *****",1393977600,,616,4.5
4855398,4,B005OZJVE2,This series is pretty good from the year it came out of don't want to spoil it for anyone by you go some action very little commonly in the storyline couple times Ville off sometimes you're sitting there thinking what's going on here. The story didn't flow through as one solid storyline you had offshoots storylines and everything else that sometimes you're sitting there scratching your head trying for broke what's going on but the year it came out it was a pretty good cartoon. So if I can have give this a rating from five I would give it almost to four stars,1393200000,,564,4.4326923076923075
4855399,5,B005OZJVE2,"I'd like to begin this review first and foremost by saying that I know what opinions, viewpoints, and shared experiences are worth these days online. Everyone has them, and not everyone likes them. That being said, I'd like to share my experience with the Skeleton Warriors DVD release that I just finished watching today.

For some time now, I had been considering purchasing this series for nostalgic purposes. Call it an early mid-life crisis if you will, but lately I've been collecting a lot of animated series DVDs from my childhood and reliving the memories of my youth. I was, admittedly, wary of buying this set however, due to the multiple reviews here that I had read of episodes not playing, or even the DVDs themselves not being read by the players being used.

I am, however, happy to say that I had absolutely no problems whatsoever with watching these DVDs. Everything ran completely smoothly, and to be honest, now that I'm a lot older, and can understand a lot of the content in Skeleton Warriors that I didn't really understand or completely follow when I was ten, I actually enjoyed the series a lot more than I had back in the day.

I'm definitely glad that I made this purchase, and am proud to say that Skeleton Warriors has earned its way onto my shelf, thanks to the hard work of those who produced the show back in the day, but also those who helped with its digital video release. Kudos to all of you for your hard work. It's been sincerely appreciated by me, for what it's worth.

Take care, everyone.",1379289600,5,1529,4.589743589743589

4855402,3,B005OZJVE2,"as a cartoon it's ok but leaves me wanting more.  not much action, not enough of anything really, sorry just not my speed.",1365811200,,122,4.304347826086956
4855403,5,B005OZJVE2,"I was a little worried about picking this up after seeing so many complaints about playback issues, but I'm happy to say it ran flawlessly on my Panasonic SA-BT230. Can't say whether it's fixed discs or just a compatible player though.

I remember watching this as a kid. As I watched through the DVDs I was getting little flashbacks from my childhood as I saw certain scenes. I was also picking up on more subtleties in the story that I was unable to understand before. I absolutely love the fact that they don't simplify the show for the sake of little kids to understand it. As a kid I was happy enough to see the good guys beat the bad guys in cartoons. Why or how didn't really matter to my young mind.

The show puts the heroes against a group of nearly indestructible skeletons, which are still ""alive"". They aren't just mindless skeletons risen up by some necromancer. These guys are capable of thinking and planning. Without giving too much away, as the show progresses, the skeleton army only gets bigger. It's a very grim outlook for the good guys. They still have to eat, sleep, and breathe. The skeletons don't really have any sort of requirements at all, except technology and human slaves to further their agenda.

Bonus feature trivia: This show was almost a computer animated show. The creators were all set to go, all they needed was a little more time to make the episodes. At the last minute they scrapped the idea because a network was willing to pick them up before they could finish, and the creators didn't want to turn them down. The show was already competing with 2 other shows for that network. They basically summed it up, and I'm paraphrasing here: ""When a network agrees to pick up your show, you say ""Yes!"".""

So who knows, maybe we will see a future series of Skeleton Warriors. The creator is certainly interested.

I hope they got the playback issues fixed, it's a shame to have such a good show held back by technical issues.",1364515200,,1961,4.559659090909091
4855404,5,B005OZJVE2,"I was a little skeptical on this release concerning how many people had problems with disc playback, but I had to give this a try anyway. I've watched both discs all the way through and it was flawless. All episodes played fine, no weird sound problems, nothing. I'm playing it on a Samsung blueray BD-D5300. So aside from the fact that this product isn't defective, the overall quality of the cartoon is pretty decent compared to other old cartoon releases and the fact they put some effort into the disc menu, have commentary and even a little booklet with the set is pretty nice. So I'm not sure if the manufacturer had some early defective copies made or if its just random dvd players that have trouble with it, but for the price I'm very happy with what I got. Its worth a shot.",1359072000,,784,4.451388888888889
4855405,4,B005OZJVE2,"Like many have expressed here, I too suffered issues whilst trying to view these discs on both an LG Blu-Ray Player (About 9 months old) & a Playstation 3 (About 6 months old); I DIDN'T have any popping, noise, pixelation or artefact issues with either the sound or video of either disc, but I DID have buffer under-run issues with the last 2 episodes on both discs however which very much broke the viewing pleasure of the set - HOWEVER!: I immediately threw the discs in my PC/Computer and they worked ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY, no issues whatsoever. ;)

So I haven't any real qualms with this set myself although I can understand why others might find these minor issues prohibitive, honestly I think these issues should be overlooked for what is otherwise a very well executed DVD set of a series that otherwise might've been forgotten and left to obscurity.

I absolutely adored this series way back in 1995 (Still do to this day), here in Australia we tended to get most US/UK/Canadian cartoons and I'm very glad that my local ""Free-to-air"" TV Networks picked up this franchise - I loved it! what 10y/o kid didn't love the idea of a warring band of Skeletons? :D

Last week I thought to myself ""I wonder if there has ever been a DVD set produced for Skeleton Warriors?"" and as I couldn't find any local releases, I decided to check Amazon; I'm so glad I did because once I found it I immediately bought it, having it arrive in just over a week's time (via Amazon's Expedited Shipping Service) from the other side of planet!

One thing that always drew me to Skeleton Warriors (Beyond the sweet premise & cartoon) was the artwork employed in the marketing and upon looking over the DVD set's cardboard sleeve, cover, booklet & discs; I was immediately blown away the liberal use of as much of it as possible. :O

I have owned a complete set of the original Fleer Ultra collector cards from '94-'95 and recognised a number of corresponding pieces of art, what I was quite impressed with though was that said artwork found its way into the DVD's menus to great effect.

The special features are quite decent considering how unlikely such things were considered 18 years ago, the ""Making of"" featurette & creator/producer audio commentaries are extremely informative, if not a little saddening actually due to how they elaborate on the downfall of the franchise but also what the possibilities and intentions this awesome show had if it had been permitted to progress past a solitary season.

If you too were a fan of the ""Skeleton Warriors"" way back in the day or have just stumbled across this gem and are curious, you truly do owe it to yourself to pick this really well done DVD set up; yes you could experience a couple of very minor playback issues, but they pale in comparison to how absurdly awesome it is just to be able to have the opportunity to own this series. ;)

So go on, purchase yourself a copy as ""These Are The Tales of The Skeleton Warriors!"".",1348185600,5,2961,4.61596958174905
