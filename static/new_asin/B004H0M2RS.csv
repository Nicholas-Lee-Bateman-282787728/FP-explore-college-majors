4375018,3,B004H0M2RS,"The movie takes place in Perseverance, Kansas; a town plagued by drought and the inability to make rain barrels. The movie jumps to 3 different time frames, 1866 (David Carradine), 1956 (Dee Wallace), and present day. The people are cursed by ""the man (Indian) in the top hat"" with hereditary severe plaque psoriasis, that can only be cured by exposure to a special annual rain (Hence the 2009 title ""The Rain""). This forces young girls to doff their clothes and go out into the rain. (nudity) Now the real problem is to ensure that the rain happens. This requires ""sacrifice"" on the part of the community. Sasha Higgins plays our mousy heroine in need of rain water and acting lessons.

Note: In the beginning a child is tied to an X frame and has his neck chewed on. His name is Samuel Mueller. Later in the movie his name is Simon Wheeler. OOPS!",1304812800,7,848,4.542483660130719
4375019,5,B004H0M2RS,great movie! doug schulze is a great director. doug showed a great ability to tell a story of three different generations and keep the audiance glued to their seats. This is his 3rd movie (and working on 4th). It is time he is recognized as a great director on the global level. I bought a few copies of this movie from Amazon so that I can also give some to friends and family as gifts.,1303171200,9,387,4.173333333333333
4375020,1,B004H0M2RS,"Now here's an innovation that I hope catches on - awful films that come with their own warning label.  Instead of simply calling their film Dark Fields, the producers of this bloated, amateurish stinker helpfully titled it DOUG SCHULZE'S Dark Fields. Remember that name. The next time you see a horror flick with Schulze's name above the title, don't waste your money.

I've been an avid indie horror fan since the late 70's, and therefore had the misfortune to see Schulze's two previous feature releases,  Hellmaster (1992) and Dark Heaven (2002).  Here is a man who just won't learn from his previous mistakes. With a running time of almost two hours, Dark Fields serves up another generous portion of bad writing, high-school drama department level acting, cheesy special effects and bargain basement production values - all the hallmarks of a Schulze spectacular.

Schulze's big selling point in this one is that it ""stars"" David Carradine, Dee Wallace and Richard Lynch. That's stretching it a bit. The total amount of screen time afforded these actors amounts to less than a quarter of the film. The rest is given over to a handful of youngsters and adult extras who look like they were pulled out of the local community theater for a few days and asked to run around looking angry, frightened, or bewildered.  Frankly, that's exactly the way I'd feel if I found myself stuck in the middle of this  low-rent production.",1303084800,4,1426,4.8921161825726145
4375021,1,B004H0M2RS,"This is a pathetic mess of a movie.  Its jumbled, confusing storyline feels like it was just made up while the cameras kept rolling, the filmmakers constantly throwing in new gimmicks and plot twists until the money finally ran out.  Pity the hapless editor who was forced to wade through the resulting pile of crappy footage and try to make sense of it.

The lead roles are played by a remarkably untalented group of young unknowns, led by Sasha Higgins. A few name actors - David Carradine, Dee Wallace and Richard Lynch - are carted in for extended cameos. All three of them look like they would rather be any place other than in this film, and it shows in their performances.

Director Doug Schulze appears to have put most of his energy into devising weird camera angles, instead of working with the talent and his script to tell a coherent story. Oh, look! He's turned the camera on its side! Creepy!

The final result is a boring, bewildering exercise in bad filmmaking that runs on and on for two excruciating hours. No wonder Schulze named the town the film is set in Perseverance: that's exactly what you'll need to make it through this clunker.",1301961600,4,1155,4.614634146341463
4375022,4,B004H0M2RS,"It's a beautifully shot and composed indie horror film which strays from the standard, boring slasher and/or torture porn elements so prevelant in the genre and actually delivers a story! With characters and plot!

It is at the end of the day a low budget film so it's not perfect but it's still a lot better than most of the crap released direct to dvd in order to keep a steady stream of new arrivals on the shelves.

Best Parts: the cinematography, score, production design and Richard Lynch and Ellen Sandweiss' acting

Least Impressive Parts: Some of the CG effects aren't great, story is kinda slow and some of the other acting is a bit stiff

Overall it has some flaws but makes up for them by being a tremendously ambitious and interesting classic style horror film.",1300924800,9,774,4.627737226277373

There are many gems to be found in the genre of independent horror.  This, however, is not one of them - it's a strictly Z-grade production in every regard.  Don't waste your time.",1300838400,7,301,4.8431372549019605
4375024,4,B004H0M2RS,"Let me preface this review by stating for the record that I'm not a fan of horror films.  Copious amounts of gore and incredibly indulgent graphic violence are simply not my cup of tea.  I like nail-biting thrillers, explosive action films, artsy flicks, mind-bending sci-fi films, and occasionally comedies - but not horror films.  Part of why I detest horror films is because of the stomach-churning gruesome `shock-effect' that these films often employ.  It almost seems like the aim of many of these movies is to successfully disgust the viewer, which seems like a recipe for a terrible film experience waiting to happen.

It appears that more horror movies these days habitually try delve further into the gory characteristics and disturbing visual aesthetics  commonly associated with horror films with such gratuitous relish, they've earned themselves the distinction of creating a sub-genre of horror - `torture-porn.'  Films that proudly bear that title, most notably ""Hostel,"" are movies that you'll never catch me watching.  Fortunately, ""The Rain"" marks one of the few modern horror movie exceptions that instead make a noteworthy effort to provide a compelling story, rather than diving into excessive disconcerting displays of the `eww' factor.

""The Rain"" tells the story of a town, cleverly named Perseverance, through three different centurial time periods - 1866, 1954, and modern-day.  In each of these timelines, it becomes increasingly evident that townsfolk desperately crave a rather elusive prey - the rain.  Whether it's for their crops or as a miraculous skin-sustaining supplement, they are in dire need of it and they'll do almost anything to obtain it...even if it means sacrificing their children.  Through these multiple timelines, the story behind this `curse' is slowly revealed and the reoccurring consequences on the later generations begin to progressively unravel.

First off, I have to mention how pleasantly surprised I was by this film.  I came into the viewing experience rather wary and apprehensive, but ""The Rain"" almost immediately began to dispel many of my negative preconceptions.  For a film that seems to have a low-budget feel, the strong execution of this movie ranks higher than some of Hollywood's finest (and most expensive).  ""The Rain"" is a fine example of how to obtain excellent production values out of an independent film.

Also, I have to deliver props to the screenwriters, Kurt Mayry and Douglas Schulze, for abandoning the torture-porn route and instead providing a throwback to some of the better-crafted old-school traditional horror flicks.  ""The Rain"" almost has a Sam Raimi feel to it, minus the unnecessary campiness of some of his more heralded horror pieces, such as ""The Evil Dead.""

I was also rather pleased with the amazingly strong cinematography in this film.  D.P. Lon  Stratton and director Douglas Schulze display a wide array of ranging landscapes and artfully designed sets through a series of creative and inspiring color schemes and imagery.  The film is certainly rather pretty to look at.  As for the scoring - composer David Bateman masterfully infuses ""The Rain"" with a quiet intensity through the film's mesmerizing soundtrack.  As for Douglas Schulze's directing abilities, this film not only proves that he has powerful cinematic vision, but he also possesses the highly capable directing chops to beautifully execute that vision.

Concerning the flaws, and as much as I was entertained by this film, there was indeed a bountiful supply of flaws - the acting was a bit of an issue for me.  As is the case with many child actors, the kids in this film weren't exactly the most emotive bunch.  With the exception of the very first child in the opening sequence, most of the child actors' wooden performances nearly felt as though they were being fed their lines between takes.  On another note, the late great David Carradine (""Kung Fu"", ""Kill Bill"") in one of his final acting performances simply delivered yet another traditional David Carradine performance.  I mean absolutely no disrespect to the legend - and he is a legend in my eyes.  But his turn in ""The Rain"" was quite similar to almost everything he's done before.  Not particularly bad acting, but not particularly good acting either.

As for the film's apparent main lead in her first major role, Sasha Higgins, who played college student Cari Lumis, also failed to wow.  On a positive note, Richard Lynch was one of ""The Rain's"" few bright acting gems, as was Tiren Jhames' performance as the creepily indomitable Mr. Saul.

As for the actual story itself, I have rather mixed feelings.  On one hand, I want to congratulate Schulze and Mayry for such a refreshingly original addition to the horror genre, and on the other hand, I was disappointed by the rather unsustainable practicality of several plot elements.  Maybe it's just me, but I had difficulty simply accepting the `curse' aspect of the story.  A twist like that might have worked for an 80s horror B-movie flick, but in modern day cinema - a film has to truly work hard to earn the trust of the audience and simultaneously impress them before whipping out a reveal like that.  Plot elements like `curses' have almost become cinematic faux-pas these days, and having that aspect casually thrown into the mix almost feels like it's stretching the suspense of disbelief unwisely close to the breaking point.

Ultimately though, I do feel that the positives outweigh the negatives here.  ""The Rain's"" winning points are the original story and the outstanding execution, and the detractors lie in the acting performance and the impracticality of certain plot choices.  Overall, I do consider this film to be surprisingly entertaining, although a bit too long.  However, it's earned my recommendation.  I give ""The Rain"" a 7/10.",1300838400,8,5840,5.122492080253432
4375025,5,B004H0M2RS,"I'm updating my preview below now that I've seen ""Dark Fields"":

It's said that horror fans aren't a very discriminating bunch.  And given the volume of crap horror movies out there, I can't argue that.  But I also take offense to it. I'm a life-long horror fan, and I regularly bypass the uncreative slashers and nauseatingly unoriginal remakes that populate the field these days.  I like a quality, original horror film. And ""Dark Fields"" fits that bill.
The story weaves three narratives, each taking place in the aptly named town of Perseverance, each in a different time period - the 1880's, the 1950's, and the present day.  The residents of Perseverance are oppressed with a curse.  Each year they suffer an affliction to their bodies and a drought to their land, the only cure for which is to sacrifice three of their children.
Three things make this movie rock.
First, director Doug Schulze's visual flair, accomplished through a knack for unique and effective composition, creepy art direction, and occasionally grisly special effects - both of the practical and CGI variety. Cinematographer Lon Stratton's dark, moody photography effectively augments Schulze's layered visuals.
Second, the cast. Icons David Carradine and Dee Wallace Stone deliver.  Both have faces you could watch read a phone book, and Schulze uses their gravitas to anchor their segments.  Richard Lynch, too, is a standout as a tortured father witnessing his daughter succumb to her initial affliction of the town's curse.
And third, the story.  I went into ""Dark Fields"" with trepidation, knowing it was an anthology piece.  Anthologies always leave me dissatisfied - I'm not a short film fan and they always feel like a string of short films to me.  But ""Dark Fields"" employs a unique structure, in which the stories unfold simultaneously, climaxing in the resolution of the curse in the present day.  They interwoven narratives build towards this common end, along the way each telling a unique story with a common theme.  It gets a little confusing sometimes -- and it demands your attention -- but it works.
""Dark Fields"" is low-budget indie horror, and like most all entries in that populous genre, the seams occasionally show.  But the trade-off is its originality.  Not Hollywood product, this.  I'll call it a thinking person's horror film, in that it's not for the mentally lazy.  There isn't a lot that's spelled out in simple terms, and little immediate satisfaction; things generally come to fruition at a deliberate pace.  But you do get the feeling that you're in the hands of a storyteller who knows his craft and will deliver. Go into it knowing that and you'll be a (discriminating) fan.

I haven't seen ""Dark Fields"", as it hasn't yet come out. But I'm a big fan of creative indie horror films, and like to support the genre. I'm posting Collider.com's review here, written when the film was titled ""The Rain"".
As Amazon requires rating reviews when posting, I'm giving this 5 out of 5 stars, based on the Collider author's enthusiasm.
Looking forward to 3/22, when ""Dark Fields"" comes out.

One of the great things about writing about films is that on occasion it gives you an opportunity to see films before others. I recently had the chance to see The Rain, a low budget independent horror film from writer-director Douglas Schulze. I must say - I was impressed. Not only by the quality of the film but also by the originality of the plot and structure. So far the film has been getting raves on the horror festival circuit and at this point it doesn't have any distribution. However, with a bit of luck all that will soon change. More after the jump:
We live in a world where horror films are seen as an inexpensive and simple product for filmmakers to make and market - and because of this, the quality of such entertainment is often questionable at best. Hollywood's attempts at the horror genre seem to have reached their nadir - with studios attempting to remake older horror franchises by using their iconic imagery and characters in order to make a quick buck (A Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween being two such examples.) What Schulze has managed to do is deliver a film that is not only bold in structure - but he also hands the audience one of the most interesting and original horror villains in over a decade.
The Rain is an interweaving tale set in the town of Perseverance. Each story takes place in three different time periods (1800's, 1950's and present day) and it follows a curse that inflicts the inhabitants of the town. Every year or so, families of Perseverance take part in a lottery to sacrifice their children in order to bring ""The Rain"" which cures them of a drought that could destroy their land and a hideous and lethal disorder that inflicts them.
Schulze has assembled an impressive cast of familiar faces for the film. The late David Carradine (Kill Bill) delivers one of his final performances as a torn father in the 1880's segment, Dee Wallace (The Howling, Bone Dry) plays a protecting mother in the 50's based chapter and Richard Lynch plays a torn father in the present day take. The film has wonderful visual style and the director shot the film using the Red digital camera and super 35mm. Each segment plays homage to their set time period, with Gothic horror the order of the day for the 19th Century portion, while the next two chapters are monster movie and stalker/slasher respectively. While on occasion there may be the odd dodgy performance - the cast all do well and give balanced performances that show the right level of fear and desperation. Tiren Jhames delivers a truly menacing performance as Mr Saul - a character who must surely get his own spin-off film in the future.
As a fan of horror it's good to see someone making a stand and produce something with originality and integrity, rather than pandering to the teenage market. Horror films tend to be best made on a low budget and what you don't see is often better than what you do. That's not to say that The Rain skimps on gore - there are some nauseating moments that have some good practical effects while the few GGI moments also work quite well. Schulze stretches his budget to breaking point (and sometimes it shows) but he's willing to put his neck on the line that doesn't involve people in their 20's getting tortured for 90 minutes.
What makes The Rain successful is that it is not a run of the mill horror tale. The fragmented structure of the film works in that you can invest enough in each segment, so that when it cuts from any specific tale you aren't disappointed. And there are enough twists and plot points to keep you intrigued. Schulze seems to genuinely understand the horror tradition - from the works of Poe through to the horror masters of the 1970's and 80's. This skill means that he is able to deliver an old fashioned horror tale that feels altogether original in today's cinematic climate.
The Rain is a great low budget horror film that not only shows that Schulze is a director to watch out for but with the inclusion of Tiren Jhames' Mr Saul he has also created a modern horror icon.
In a sentence - The Rain is an original horror tale and exceeds the quality of most of Hollywood's current horror output. Hopefully, on release soon.",1300579200,7,7285,4.743873517786561

None of the stories turn out as you'd expect and the movie doesn't have the formulaic leave-it-hanging ending, either, thank goodness.  It did leave some questions unanswered, some plot holes unpatched, but my only real gripe is that the makeup in places is unconvincing.  But the acting was pretty decent, it had genuine creepiness and atmospheric horror (mostly lacking in today's gorefests, which seem to rely on special effects at the expense of expendable minor things like plot and acting).
