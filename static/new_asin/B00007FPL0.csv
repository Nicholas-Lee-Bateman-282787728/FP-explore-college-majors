7975696,5,B00007FPL0,"Please see my review of tape 1 in this series.  The positive and negative comments apply to all the tapes/DVD's in this series.  Only the techniques differ from tape to tape.

Basically, I agree with reviewer O.S. Baluch from London.  This particular lesson covers blocking against kicks and elbows and countering techniques.  Using the training pads is also addressed.

I can't say enough about how well thought-out these lessons are and how well presented they are.  Mr. Janjira is truly a gifted person.",1101513600,4,506,5.024096385542169
7975697,1,B00007FPL0,"The advice in this DVD is the same advice you'd get in many DVDs on Muay Thai, however, the quality of the production is extremely low. The sound is awful. Look elsewhere unless you don't mind spending $30 for low-quality production values and generic advice.",1094688000,5,259,4.777777777777778
7975698,4,B00007FPL0,"Brilliant blocking drills for kicks, knees and elbows make this dvd well worth buying for anyone training in Muay Thai. Good demonstration of basic pad drills. No advanced pad drills or combinations, however the tips from Saekson Janjira are excellent.",1083283200,4,252,5.325
