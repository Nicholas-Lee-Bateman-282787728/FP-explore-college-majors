8734381,5,B015RTPNU0,"In the 1950's decade, Maria Callas ""was opera"" in every sense of the word. Her voice was the fullest and the best of her entire career. And to top it all off, she was so lovely to look at too, with her slender feminine figure, and terrific stage personality too. In the past, with the exception of Renata Tibaldi, feminine opera singers gave the appearance of an NFL fullback!!! - just Big, bless their hearts!!!
For all these reasons, Maria Callas is the supreme role model for all upcoming opera singers - one who they would all try to emulate, but never succeed - even those lucky enough to train at the Julliard School of Music.
