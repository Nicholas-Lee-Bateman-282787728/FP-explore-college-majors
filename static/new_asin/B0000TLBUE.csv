1943870,4,B0000TLBUE,"I have searched for a while for a program that I could feel comfortable with and I have found it!

It is simple to follow yet intense enough to get a good work out. She does a great job of building you up and cooling you down and not leaving you worn out! This music is a mix of hymns, praise songs and just instrumental. I would recommend this DVD to anyone! Even my mom who has server knee trouble does the one mile walk with easy and it's great! It is NOT a dance program, just a mix of walking in place, kicks, knee lifts and sidesteps, all while working the upper body as well. You won't regret this one! It doesn't require a lot of floor space and can be done in 20 minutes ( One mile) or 32 minutes ( two mile).",1171843200,22,718,3.9517241379310346
1943871,5,B0000TLBUE,i really like this video. i don't always like to go to the gym so it's great to walk with this video. it is very low impact which is just what i need right now. my daughter enjoyed it too running circles around me and then giving up halfway through. the only improvement i would like is a way to play it with just the music once i learn the routine.,1168128000,5,349,3.9295774647887325

The music is relaxing.  (Relax and excercise in the same sentence???  It really is enjoyable music.)  After one week of 3 times per week, I was able to keep up with her without having to slow down.

1943876,5,B0000TLBUE,Classic and thorough Leslie Sansone.  Always love that her steps are easy to do.  Be aware that a significant part of the aerobic effect comes from arm movements done rapidly.  Most women have not used their arms in that way since their days of monkey bars.  I ended up in pain and doctor said just to do the step portion.,1447286400,,322,4.316666666666666

1943891,5,B0000TLBUE,CD is great to you when you just want to stay in on those cold days.  Makes walking a little easier.  I am unable to do any other exercise but walking.  This serves the purpose,1401062400,,176,3.9714285714285715
1943892,5,B0000TLBUE,"Well, not exactly. But what you get is a brisk one mile walking workout, plus an even brisker two mile working workout once you've mastered the one mile walk. A very good buy. Very easy to follow Leslie, she switches things around so you don't get bored, and the 20 minutes it takes to do the one mile go by really quickly. This is also very low impact exercise, which is important to me as I'm in my ""golden years' (ha ha), but I was very de-conditioned and this was the perfect thing to get my metabolism revved up and my muscles and joints moving again. I've seen nothing but improvement in my muscle and joint pain, and my energy has gone up notably. I can walk without pain once more, and can hoist myself into my high-profile vehicle without struggling like I was before I started doing this workout every day. So it's all good. Even Leslie's endless references to God and the religious music she plays for pacing don't deter me from doing this workout once a day at least, and usually twice - once when I get up, and once in the afternoon to keep my joints from tightening up. It's worth it, people - get out there and DO IT! It's the best bargain around for the price - and you can work out whenever YOU want to and not have to worry about the weather, strange people, and dogs running after you. My neighbors probably think I'm nuts (my morning workout is at just before 2 a.m.), but that's okay - I'm reaping the benefits every day. Five stars.",1397174400,3,1454,4.310218978102189

1943898,5,B0000TLBUE,"I think I must own almost every single DVD Leslie has done. She's such an awesome instructor and her program is so easy to do at home. You don't need any extra equipment, you just pop in the DVD and you are on your way.

This is among my favorite of Leslie's discs. It has both a one and a two mile walk included. While I do use the two mile walk occasionally I find myself using the one mile walk far more often and sometimes even do it twice in a day. At just about 20 minutes long it's the perfect length to squeeze in at any time.

Leslie's so upbeat and positive and encouraging that it makes her videos fun. She also includes people of all shapes and sizes in her videos which makes them perfect for everyone.

When I first started with Leslie's discs I couldn't finish the one mile walk and I've slowly worked my way up and through most of her walks, even though the one mile will always remain my favorite. No matter what your starting point Leslie's program is for you.",1390694400,,978,4.191489361702128

1943903,5,B0000TLBUE,I absolutely love this exercise video. I am overweight and I can do the mile no problem. She is very positive and I love the praise music in the background. In no time at all you can walk a mile in your own living room. No excuses for it being to cold outside!,1385078400,,260,3.9245283018867925

I'm 57 yo and work-out everyday, so I'm no slacker.  This DVD is perfect when you want a work-out that is a little less intense than most of Leslie's stuff.  The technical quality and the music are not all that I might wish for, so that is why I only gave four stars.  Still, I am very happy wiith my purchase and have used the DVD 3 times since I received it two weeks ago.

1943922,5,B0000TLBUE,"I REALLY enjoy the 1 and 2 mile workouts. You are praising God while you're working out. Like she says it's a great way to start your morning or end your evening. I think this came out about 10 years ago, but the workout is timeless in my opinion. Unlike the other workouts, you don't use a ball or stretchy band (I appreciate the break), but there is still plenty of arm movement.  There are also only 2 ladies in the background in the 2 mile walk (the 1 mile she is solo) and I like that. Not really a big fan of videos where there are a bunch of folks in the back making comments in an effort to inspire you. I find it distracting and sort of annoying. I also purchased A Closer 2 Mile Walk for a change-up, but have not yet done the workout.  I hope she comes out with more faith-based workouts in varying miles.",1365811200,,816,4.09375

This is my third workout DVD from her and it's my least favorite. This one has a faith-based theme including hymns to work out by and  some remarks about praise and thanking God for our blessings. That is fine with me. What doesn't work so well is that I think the choice of hymns (Amazing Grace for one) really doesn't fit the workout. Plus the background music is very faint and barely audible over her almost constant chatter. It just seems like a good idea that wasn't executed well.

She also offers intermediate and advanced walk routines in her series.  I strongly recommend this workout to anyone who wants to begin exercising.",1297468800,,570,5.431818181818182
1943942,5,B0000TLBUE,"I love this DVD.  I knew I needed to walk regularly. When my daughter told me about these walk at home DVDs, I decided to explore these online and then on Amazon. I am glad I did. It gives freedom to go at your own pace, but still get a good structured exercise.
 What is wonderful it is very affordable through Amazon, and you can do it in your own home. It is  not demanding on your body as you are encouraged to start out at a comfortable pace and work up as you feel fits YOU. I would  recommend any one that has resisted regular exercise as I have to  buy this and enjoy it benefits. The inspirational music in the background and Leslie Sansone's words lift my  soul as well as I have more energy after I finished walking my mile in just 17 min. for the rest of my day. This is excellent for any one no matter the age or physical condition. There is also a 2 mile work out included which I plan to work up to. Don't be afraid seniors to give this a try. Also mom's and dad's and even those that have a busy work schedule. You will be glad you did.",1295481600,,1052,3.9857142857142858

With this DVD, Leslie Sansone offers fun routines and sincere reminder to lift your hands in praise and thanks to the One who blesses you to get your body moving each day.",1295136000,,415,4.859154929577465
1943944,2,B0000TLBUE,"Ok, in the past I have loved Leslie's workout tapes.  My favorite is her old 2003 Super Challenge 4 mile Express tape.  After a few years of not exercising, I purchased her ""Christian Inspired"" Walk the Walk 1 or 2 mile CD.  I was surprised at how much religiousity is in this CD.  The background music consists of Christian hymns and Leslie does a bit of sermonizing and God praising throughout the workout.  If you are a devout Christian believer, this CD is for you.  I still love her older, religion neutral workout sessions that are great for out of shape beginners and seniors like me.",1294617600,2,591,4.528301886792453

Try it!",1290470400,2,316,4.031746031746032
1943946,5,B0000TLBUE,"I'm not a churchy-preachy type and usually stay away from religious-themed items, but something attracted me to this DVD (the other rave reviews, maybe) and I bought it. My first Leslie Sansone purchase was a VHS version of a 2-mile walk that I got from Walkers Warehouse 6 years ago. I paid a local shop to transfer it to DVD and my mother and I (she's in her 70s) used it for years until the DVD died. Tried to get the VHS transferred again but the guy couldn't do it, so I was overjoyed to find a selection of Leslie's DVDs here on Amazon. I bought two, one of which was Walk the Walk. The other was a 3 mile which my mother used, while I stuck to Walk the Walk.

A few months ago burglars broke into our house and took my laptop - with Walk the Walk in it - and the DVD player - with the 3 mile walk nestled inside. (We rarely took them out because we used the DVDs almost every day.) I came right back on here and ordered a 4 mile and a replacement copy of... Walk the Walk.

Walk the Walk never fails to put me in a good mood. It makes me happy that I made the time to exercise, and there's the added bonus of connecting me with my spirituality. Love the upbeat versions of my favorite hymns, and I enjoy Leslie's little pep talks. Yes, she talks a lot, but I don't mind because it comes from the heart and makes me smile. Sometimes I've lapsed with the workouts, and every time I do my blood pressure starts creeping up to the hypertensive range. As soon as I get back into the discipline of these workouts - I'm talking about IMMEDIATELY - I get right back down to a healthy blood pressure and heart rate range. Combined with a sensible diet, these workouts tone the body and help me shed excess weight. Leslie, thank you for the work that you do!",1289088000,24,1755,4.128654970760234
1943947,5,B0000TLBUE,"Great, low impact workout! Great for beginner or more advanced. The one mile takes about 20 minutes and the two mile takes about 30 minutes!",1286323200,,140,4.64
1943948,5,B0000TLBUE,"Leslie Sansone's ""Walk the Walk"" features two in-home walking workouts set to Christian music. The first workout is a one mile workout; the second workout is two miles long.

One Mile Workout

Lasting about twenty minutes, this workout is perfect for beginners, especially those new to Leslie's in-home walking programs. This workout features just Leslie and is slow-paced which is good for beginners but may be a bit too slow for those who are used to Leslie's workouts. (I return to this workout if I've been unable to exercise for awhile and need something to ease my way back in to exercising). The workout features all of Leslie's standard moves: walk in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, kick backs, walk forward and back. Leslie explains each move before she does it. One of the things I like about Leslie is that she makes it seem like she is talking directly to you throughout the workout. The Christian music is nice but unobtrusive, never interfering with the workout.

Two Mile Workout

Lasting about 35 minutes, this two mile workout is good for those who have mastered the one mile walk and want to try something a bit more strenuous. Featuring Leslie with two other women, this is one of her easiest two mile workouts. Again it features the usual Leslie moves: walk in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, kick backs, walk forward and back and nothing extra like double knee lifts that are featured in some of her other two miles walks. This is a good workout for those who are new to two mile workouts as well as for those who want to do two miles without overexerting themselves. The one major difference in this workout is that during the stretches after the workout a minister friend of Leslie speaks. His speech is inspiring and don't be surprised if you walk around saying ""I love you"" after doing this workout.

Long-time fans of Leslie may not find these two workouts challenging enough, but they are perfect for those who are new to in-home walking.",1280880000,6,1978,4.705202312138728
1943949,5,B0000TLBUE,"I enjoy this DVD for its great to have to use on days you can't get outdoors to walk and the music Leslie uses on it is so beautiful. I work for a weight group and the one thing we recommend to our members is walking to help them lose their weight, but as I said if one cannot get outdoors to walk this is a great DVD to use indoors. I have many of Leslie Sansone DVD's and I like everyone of them, and believe me you may be doing the walking indoors but you'll still get a workout.................

Sincerely,
  Lyn",1277424000,,516,4.03921568627451
1943950,5,B0000TLBUE,"I bought this for my mom for her church exercise group. They love it! I also like the choice of songs that she uses, it really keeps you motivated!",1273536000,2,147,4.103448275862069
1943951,5,B0000TLBUE,"After surviving a heart attack, Leslie is my primary rehab workout therapist. Even medically approved by my own doctors. This is a very special pair of walking/aerobic workouts (low impact) because of the Christian inspiration moderately included, and the wonderful traditional faith music for the background. ""Walk the Walk"" truly is a full measure of health: body, mind, and spirit. I use several Sansone DVDs for daily exercise, and this is a favorite because of my brush with death, which leads to a stronger appreciated faith.

It's easy enough for a 60+ heart patient, yet enough of a workout that you'll sweat. That's good, that's what they pushed for in cardio-rehab visits too. Leslie's walking/stepping workouts complete the same motions that was initiated in cardio-rehab; only they used expensive treadmills, stepping machines, stationary bikes, and rowing equipment. Here you get the same intensity of workout at the cost of a DVD, and it's done right in your own private living room.

Even better, for me, is the opportunity to exercise with my wife (also 60+). She became a Weight Watcher Lifer, at optimum weight, using Sansone walking and weight techniques and DVDs combined with her diet. We're maintaining weight standards, as well as healthier check-ups with the doctor. The cardiologist is now at 6-month intervals. It pays to walk for health, and doing it with this particular ""Christian Inspired"" DVD makes it fun and a devotional time at the same time. It's not preachy on the religious or health dialogue. Just inspiring, on both aspects.

We often use the 2-Mile Intermediate workout but also use the 1-Mile by going through it twice just to enjoy the different music for exercising time. It is not Sansone's newest workout DVD but one of the classics in her assortment. A must for the Christian needing exercise health, weight loss, or a way to mix your faith with your healthy body shaping needs.

I get nothing for writing praises of Leslie Sansone walking DVDs reviews. No free DVDs, no cash, nothing...except a longer, healthier life-style. Praise the Lord for that.",1265673600,14,2097,5.0520231213872835
1943952,5,B0000TLBUE,"Walk the Walk DVD is for a day when you just want to move little. It helps me when I just need to get centered without the Cardio bast I get from Leslie's other DVD's. My husband & I have so many of Leslie's walk at home DVD's. Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week. We wouldn't trade her for the world!",1264464000,,956,4.229508196721311

I lost three pounds the first week using the 20-minute, one-mile workout in the evening (and eating as sensibly as I possibly could).  And although the DVD is labeled ""Christian Inspired"" I don't believe it would alienate the average user.  In fact, I'm certainly no holy roller, but the music in this workout is my favorite of any DVD I own because it's upbeat.  I actually find myself humming the tunes during the day when I'm not using the DVD.  Additionally, the set is truly warm and inviting.  It looks like the interior of a well-appointed home and serves to be both relaxing and exhilarating at the same time.  The set alone makes this the workout I want to pull out and do every day.  It feels as if you're going to the gorgeous home of a friend to exercise together.  I like having the option of both the one-mile and two-mile workouts.  For me, doing either one in the evening is a great way to burn off those after-dinner calories, get rid of any tension from the day, relax, and get ready for some zzzz's.

The music is terrific; they've taken religious songs and made them perfect as working out tunes.  I also love the fact that she does the one-mile workout by herself.  I actually would like to see her do that more often.  It's just more calming to me and encourages me b/c it's not like this big production in which I'm expected to be bouncing off the walls w/energy.  I also like the kind of workouts in which you're doing that, but sometimes the calmer one is better for me for this reason or that.  I personally LOVE her constant talking!  First of all, she's seems like an absolutely delightful person who you'd want as your friend.  Secondly, I find her talking highly encouraging and think that the workout would be tedious without it.  She makes me laugh quite often with her humility and sense of humor, and it's a nice touch to see/hear her interact w/her fellow walkers (Carol, the short-haired, red-headed lady is adorable and my favorite - she's in numerous of Leslie's videos).  So for me, her chattiness is a definite plus :-) .  Because of her, I am working out almost every day and actually enjoying it.
