8115101,1,B000EWBO3G,"I am a great fan of Hungarian cinema but this is one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time.  The characters gives ""speeches"" rather than converse with each other; one never feels sympathy for any of the characters; the plot twists and turns without ever seeming real or engaging;the props and settings are amateur.  The script is awful and with such bad material it is little wonder none of the actors really shine. Kroly Eperjes is a great actor and his work in live theater is light years away from this film, which I assume he undertook to pay the bills. Istvn Szab's ""Sunshine"", which this film echoes, is a much, much better watch than this.",1190505600,2,658,4.475
8115102,1,B000EWBO3G,This movie is just horrible - the acting is so unrealistic and bad that I couldn't watch it past the first 10 minutes.,1178928000,,118,4.173913043478261
