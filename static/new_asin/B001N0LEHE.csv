very colorful in parts.",1441929600,,111,4.333333333333333
8322699,5,B001N0LEHE,"Bought this on the recommendation of a friend who visited Kaktovik, Alaska, where the filmmakers live (she met them).  Usually, I find ""nature"" movies over-narrated, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear just music and no voice-over on this DVD.  Just beautiful polar bears and music!

I hope to visit Alaska one day to see polar bears in person, but for now, this DVD fits my budget!  Will buy more to give this year as Xmas gifts for my animal-lover friends and my young niece/nephews, as I think children would enjoy some time watching real animals (not animated).",1381536000,,567,4.755102040816326
8322700,1,B001N0LEHE,"this dvd was a pathetic attempt at realism. I expected something unique and very different from the polemics that we see on pbs. the video-ographers did not translate a bear experience to the viewer in spite of living ""in the village"" for a year. I will not share the dvd with friends.",1246752000,,285,4.5
