8186364,3,B000OR0THS,"The animation is not great but pretty good. The voice acting is solid. The jokes are hit-and-miss at best. The story while pretty good,it's the same one we heard over & over again. Pokemon,Digimon & Tai Chi Chasers would do similar episodes like this years later. The morale while a good one,it's phoned in a mile away in this case. Overall, it's so-so at best. I give this episode a 6 out of 10. BTW: Is The Greed Monster voiced by John Kassir(The same voice actor who did The Crypt Keeper)? If so? then that would be the most awesome thing about this episode!",1349049600,,561,4.403846153846154
