7949250,2,B00005OW15,"This movie is a complete wast of money, even for the true MMA fan. Most of the fights are horrendously boring ground and pound fights that go to a decision. There is absolutely no fight in here that was a real good matchup. especially the main event. Royler just gets completely dismantled by Sakuraba. It is a really boring fight. Royler just sits on the grond and Sakuraba continuously kicks him in the leg. And don't think im giving this DVD such a bad review because im not a true MMA fan. I practice judo and ju jitsu three times a week so i have great appreciation for the ground game, but this DVD is horrible. Please do youselves a favour and save your money, don't by PRIDE 8.",1070841600,,685,4.317829457364341
7949251,5,B00005OW15,"Pride 8 is the first time that Sakuraba faces a Gracie. The Gracie legacy is on the line. Royler is faced with the burden of defending the undefeated Gracie legacy. Sakuraba is burdened with avenging the loss of his mentor to Rickson Gracie.
Sakuraba always puts on an entertaining fight and this time is no exception. Plenty of standup and ground action, topped off with a controversial ending.
Another excellent fight worthy of mention is Silva vs Matsui, plenty of action. You'll see why he deserves his moniker of ""The Axe Murderer"". Vovchanchyn versus Bueno and Trigg vs Iha are also great fights. There are two boring fights Coleman vs Morais and Erikson vs Goodridge. It's a pity they don't have a ""reset the fighters when there's no action rule"".
However all in all a great night of action and well worth the purchase! It's got everything you'd want good standup action, grappling action, knockouts...the works!",1044144000,,919,4.897435897435898
7949252,5,B00005OW15,"Pride FC holds the best mixed martial arts tournaments in the world.  I've seen almost all of them, and Pride 8 ranks near the top.  The DVD is almost 3 hours long and 2 sided, so midway through, you have to flip the disc.  You'll get to see Mark Coleman at 6' 1"" take on 6' 8"" Brazilian Ricardo Morais, and Daijiro Matsui's huge heart as he battles the Axe Murderer, Vanderlei Silva.  Vovchanchyn vs. Bueno is a fight between 2 great strikers.  This disc is packed with knockouts, great submission techniques, and climaxes with plenty of drama in the main event between Kazushi Sakuraba and Royler Gracie.  Previous to this Pride, Sakuraba had fought the Brazilians who are experts in Ju Jitsu and sumbissions.  He has been undefeated.  Rickson Gracie had beaten Sakuraba's teacher, Takada twice, both times by submission.  It's time to let it all hang out between Sak and the Gracie family.",1017014400,7,892,4.703225806451613
7949253,4,B00005OW15,"Pride 8 was held on November 21, 1999 at the Ariake Colosseum.
The first match is between Pride veteran Daijiro Matsui and IVC and UFC veteran Vanderlei Silva. Great fight between two fighter that don't back down.
The second match is between Shooto and Japan Vale Tudo 1998 veteran Frank Triggs and Extreme Challenge and UFC veteran Fabiano Iha. Another good match with a good ending.
The third match is between Pride veteran Carl Malenko and Pancrase, Extreme Challenge, Extreme Fighting, UFC and Pride veteran Allan Goes. Another good match with a good ending.
The fourth match is between AFC 1 32 man tournament winner, RINGS and Pentagon Combat veteran Ricardo Morais and UFC 10 & 11 tournament winner and former UFC Heavyweight champion Mark Coleman. This is a dull match.
The fifth match is between AFC 3 tournament winner, IFC 1 tournament winner and WVC 5 tournament winner Igor Vovchanchyn and IVC and Pride veteran Francisco Bueno. This as one of the best knockouts I have seen.
The sixth match is between UFC 8 finalist and IVC 1 tournament winner Gary Goodridge and MARS and Japan Vale Tudo veteran Tom Erikson. Beginning is good, but I wish the rest of the match was good.
The seventh match is between Pride veteran Alexander Otsuka and World Combat Championship tournament winner Renzo Gracie. Great fight and I want a rematch.
The main event is between UFC Japan tournament winner and Pride veteran Kazushi Sakuraba and Universal Vale Tudo, Japan Vale Tudo and Pride veteran Royler Gracie. Great fight with a exciting ending.
I recommand for anyone who like MMA.",1007510400,5,1577,4.888059701492537
7949254,4,B00005OW15,"The name that put MMA on the map is Gracie. Ever since Royce Gracie won the first (2nd,and 4th) UFC tournament(s), the name  became of legend. Many other brothers and cousins of Royce have followed and succeeded in MMA. but within the 3 brothers (Royce, Rickson, and Royler), not a blemish was recorded in MMA competition. The smallest of the Gracies; Royler, became the first to challenge a curious Japanese fighter by the name of Kazushi Sakuraba, who was in a major winning streak. The fight was lopsided, and the ending was incredible, with a dash of controversy.
Besides the main event, other fights were very much mentioning. The Vanderlei Silva/Daijiro Matsui was a brutal exhibition of knees, knees, and an elbow. Both fighters were known for their ""forward"" approach to fighting. Pretty bloody.
Trigg vs. Iha was quite the fight. Trigg is known as a wrestler with some heavy fists. While Iha is renown for slapping a quick Armbar on the best. A little bit of a mismatch (as far as weight is concerned), may best explain the outcome.
Carl Malenko a surprise victor in Pride 6 over Egan Inoue and a game fight against Vanderlei Silva in Pride 7, was back to test himself against BJJ superstar Allan Goes. The fight even, until the magic of submissions happened.
A seriously impressive match up between Mark Coleman and Ricardo Morais also took place. On paper, this fight should have been a war, but was a big letdown. Former UFC champion Coleman, was trying to restart a recent skid of 4 losses in a row(really 3). On the other corner stood a 6'9"" 280 pound ""Mutant"" of a man: Ricardo Morais. Having seen many a MMA fight, I have only been taken back by a few individuals. Manny Yarborough and Semmy Shilt are two specimens hard to forget......Morais is another. He looked like a pro wreslter, without the glitz. The fight like early mentioned, was dull....but Morais was impressive just to look at.
Another heavyweight matchup that fell short to expectations was the Gary Goodridge/Tom Erickson fight. Worth skipping, pretty predictable after the first several minutes.
After shocking the world (and Marco Ruas), Alexander Otsuka was back to challenge Renzo Gracie. Otsuka's ""in-your-face"" style proved too much for an ailing Ruas, but how would he do against a healthy Renzo. Renzo and Otsuka provided a technical war that would go to the judges, but without controversy.
The ""replay"" fight of the night was between Igor Vovchanchyn and Francisco Bueno. One punch, yes one punch decided this one: An all-time classic finish!
Before the main event was to take place, Royler and Pride (DSE) agreed to ""Gracie"" rules. Basically unlimited time and rounds. Royler arguably the best Flyweight submissions fighter in the world, was giving up 35 pounds to 185lb Sakuraba. He gave up over 50lbs to Yuhi Sano in Pride 2, but Sakuraba was no punching bag..rather very skilled. After beating Conan, Tiger White, Newton, Belfort, Braga..and a draw versus Allan Goes, Sakuraba had more than ""earned"" a shot at a Gracie. He was ready and poised. The fight was hard to watch... a clear mismatch. the end was controversial...but the outcome would have been the same. An important fight for Pride and MMA.",1006300800,5,3197,4.876838235294118
