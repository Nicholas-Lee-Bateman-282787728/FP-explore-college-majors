8272081,1,B000E5LF0U,"I saw this product in a Fye video store.  I wanted to know more about it, so I asked Fye employees about this video.  They were not able to tell me the video's total playback time or whether it was a cartoon or not.  In fact, they did a special search for greater information and could not tell me more about the video.  So, I decided to purchase it on Amazon.  When I received it, I was disappointed that it was not a black African Jamician cartoon.  Instead, it looked like a stage home-made play with a Jamician story, judging by the previews.  Unfortunately, the dvd video never progressed past the previews and I never saw the main movie/film/presentation.  I tried numerous times to advance the dvd video past the previews and into the main presentation, but could not do so.  It was clear that I had a faulty dvd video.  I contacted Amazon and was able to return the video.  I declined a replacement as I thought the video cover failed to mention that the video is not a cartoon/animation and judging by the previews, I was about to watch a play and not a film.  To be honest, I felt misled.  Note, if you are interested in this product, it is a stage play with real people in a Jamician comedy setting and it lasts for about an hour or so.",1307750400,,1247,4.3004291845493565
