2585162,5,B000FTCLTY,"I bought this DVD of the History of the Texas Longhorns for my 88 year-old father-in-law who grew up in Austin and graduated from UT.  He is still a big football fan and loves watching pro and college football.  I expected him to watch this DVD and enjoy it, but he not only enjoyed it, he remembered a lot of the players names.  It was unbelievable.  I'm so happy I found this DVD for him to enjoy.  At his age, it's hard to find gifts that he truly enjoys but this was sure one of them.",1169078400,12,488,4.041666666666667
