Jack, Victor, and the gang will remind you of any old folks you may know (Victor is like my grandpa)--you may even want to BE like them when you grow up.

As a southern gal it took me a bit to catch everything, but if you've watched British comedies, you'll soon develop a Glaswegian ear, but it's safe to say that Scottish humor is a bit more in-your-face than British humor, in my opinion, and ""Still Game"" is, too. Never mind they're a bunch of old duffers.

I suggest you get in the game now because the creators of ""Still Game"" (Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill) have just invaded England so you KNOW the USA isn't far behind.",1129852800,,758,4.361702127659575
7976886,5,B00007JO70,"This show is hilarious. Became a fan with a visit to Scotland this past summer.  While the video is funny, the TV shows are more true to form as they are filmed around typical Glasgow high rises and show much more of the Glasgow scenery.  Nevertheless, this video allows Still Game fans to get their ""fix""!",1104969600,2,306,4.446428571428571

7976888,5,B00007JO70,"This show, of two crotchety old Scots and their batch of cronies, is hilarious.  I would love to review the actual item that Amazon is selling, but I can't even tell from the description which episodes it contains.  Alas and alack.",1091664000,2,231,4.609756097560975
