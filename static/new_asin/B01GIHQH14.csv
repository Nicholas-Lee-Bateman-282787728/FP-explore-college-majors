8762955,5,B01GIHQH14,"A good deal of fun with care taken both with characters and plots - not insanely violent or erotic - plenty of London and a fair mix of its society are woven in. By the way, anyone who does not have a DVD player that plays PAL discs is missing the best TV being produced today, in a wide variety of European countries from Finland to Spain, Denmark, Italy and Germany. Do yourself a favor and buy a PAL player.",1510531200,,410,4.1375
