2910682,1,B000TVS5XY,"Perfect as David Suchet is, one only needs one copy of any Poirot movie. Buying these DVDs is like making a mystery purchase. Until Amazon is prepared to protect customers by ensuring that the titles of the movies on each DVD are listed, so that you know what you are purchasing, my strong advice is don't buy.  Or try Amazon UK for more honest advertising.",1283299200,34,357,4.492307692307692

2910684,4,B000TVS5XY,"I love Poirot, and especially David Suchet's portrayal....BUT....Why oh Why can't Acorn provide closed captioning on their movies? I realize that the general public would never think of this option, but there are many of us that are hearing impaired and would also love to be able to enjoy many of the wonderful movies that are out there..Most other companies offer subtitles. Please Acorn, if you ever read these reviews, think about adding closed captioning for the quiet minority. I thank you for listening.",1272412800,39,510,5.083333333333333
2910685,5,B000TVS5XY,"David Suchet is the definitive Poirot.  This series of stories are marvelous.  There is so much attention to detail for the sets, the cars, the clothes and hair.  And of course, moustaches!  The acting and scripts are superb.  These shows are timeless and I enjoy watching mine over and over.  The times represented in these stories have passed and gone; and one way we can see them or imagine them are with faithful recreations to Dame Agatha Christie's stories and their time.  I have many of the Poirot DVDs in my library and will collect all of them in time.  I also collect the audios done by David Suchet and his Captain Hastings.  Dame Agatha set the standard for the English mystery:  David Suchet set the standard for Poirot!",1268697600,8,734,4.62015503875969
2910686,5,B000TVS5XY,"I wanted this DVD set for ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas."" The first two copies I purchased at a local Barnes & Noble store were from Acorn and the special movie I wanted was faulty. The sound track did not match the flow of the images. Women's voices came out of the male actor's mouths. The images had a ""washed out look"" as far as the color showed. The second replacement copy had the same error. Hence, I finally ordered this set from Amazon.com and the Christmas film is in perfect shape as are its two companion movies. All three movies are among the best Suchet films.",1481241600,,572,4.457142857142857

2910693,5,B000TVS5XY,"This collection features Peril At End House, Dumb Witness, and Hercule Poirot's Christmas.

Peril At End House included the full trio (Miss Lemon, Capt. Hastings, Inspector Japp). It gave me the impression that it was originally shown in two parts. Personally, it was one of my least favorite stories, but that is purely personal taste.

Dumb Witness had Bob the dog adding to the interest in this story. This had Captain Hastings, but no Japp or Lemon in it. I thoroughly enjoyed the story.

I read Hercule Poirot's Christmas. It was fairly faithful to the book, except for adding a prologue, and having scenes that may have given the conclusion away (based on having read the book). Still, it was a well done movie. This one included Japp, but no Lemon or Hastings.",1419465600,,767,4.7518796992481205

2910707,5,B000TVS5XY,"We like to watch dramas/mysteries that rely on writing, acting, directing and scenery.  Any show that uses sex or nudity or special effects is missing one or more of those four requirements.  The Poirot mysteries with David Suchet charge away on all four cylinders.  These are really good family entertainment.  The shows move along at a pace that allows you to exercise your little gray cells.  As I watched Peril at End House, I felt something was missing until, about half way through, Inspector Japp appeared.  He really adds a lot to these shows.  Although, Inspector Japp was not in Dumb Witness, the plot and suspects were entertaining enough to keep me guessing throughout - unfortunately, my own little gray cells were not able to figure out the murderer until Poirot worked through his ""gather all the suspects"" scene.  We haven't watched the third one yet, but I am sure we won't be disappointed.",1387065600,2,907,4.8441558441558445

2910710,5,B000TVS5XY,Three of the prized Poirot collection I did not have & been hunting down. Here they are altogether. Great combination. Dumb Witness one of the most fun Poirots. Peril at End House keeps one guessing to the last. Poirot's Christmas is a classic; love Inspector Japp with Poirot in that one.,1385510400,2,289,4.686274509803922

2910715,5,B000TVS5XY,"I liked all three films but I loved Dumb Witness.  It had humor, murder and intelligence.  I don't think any actor would play Hercule as well as David Suchet.  He is an all around actor, I saw him in Executive Decision amd what a different character, a terronist of the vilest sort.",1352937600,,282,4.384615384615385
2910716,5,B000TVS5XY,"Product is okay.  I am disappoited to find the movies in this set are ones we already had in other collections.

2910719,1,B000TVS5XY,Acorn really missed the boat! These great feature long movies do not have sub-titles. There are over a million hearing impared people in the USA! What is wrong with this picture!!!!  PLEASE re-release all the Poirot Movies with sub-titles!!!!!!!,1331251200,,245,5.282051282051282
2910720,5,B000TVS5XY,"I was always very curious when I used to see my mother buy and read this novels, it always made me wonder what was the fascination?  I remember she used to tell me how my grandmother was a fun of this novelist, and when she was young she also wonder...specially because my grandfather used to always make negative comments about her choice of literature.  Well, am I impress? YES!  Dame Agatha Christie knew what she was doing. And I'm glad that my mother was enchanted with both Poirot & Marple, the first movie she saw was the black and white ""And then there were none"", she was disappointed with the ending, since it's not how it ends in the novel, but it started her in her way to find more books and movies, I have been very happy to purchase them through Amazon, we just simply can't get enough of Amazon.  This movie collection is just great, but my favorite is ""Dumb Witness"", what a great plot!  My hat off to Mr Poirot for being so  annoying with his extreme ways, and yet fascinating to watch.",1327881600,2,1004,4.370967741935484

2910722,5,B000TVS5XY,"As usual, this was a great collection with Poirot. Always enjoy his mysteries and Agatha Christie of course is an excellent writer.
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys mysteries. It's hard to find good ones in the USA.",1316131200,4,226,4.675
2910723,5,B000TVS5XY,"I own all but 2 of the Poirot series with David Suchet as Poirot. I will eventually purchase the whole series, and will be sad when I have come to the end. David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.
Thank you",1310860800,5,514,4.15
2910724,4,B000TVS5XY,Very good movie quality with Poirot who is always very respectable and intelligent. Interesting turns and twists until the killer is identified.,1308009600,2,144,5.590909090909091
2910725,5,B000TVS5XY,"T am one of the many who love David Suchet as Poirot .In a Poirot DVD on Supersluths, Suchet talks about the careful study and accuracy he wanted to bring to the character and how the descendents of Dame Agatha Christie were so pleased with his efforts. The anachronisfic accuracy of the Cars, Planes, Trains and clothes of the 1930`s Deco and Great Mystery`s , It truly is like Dining verses just Eating. I want get all of the Poirot Series.",1303603200,3,442,4.469135802469136

8211154,4,B000TVS5XY,"Hercule at his best. Mind you it's a bit dated, but it's what you would expect of Masterpiece Theater. The only reason for 4 stars id the lack of Close Captioning. I purchased Set # 1 sometime back and it had CC.",1520467200,,212,4.071428571428571

8211157,5,B000TVS5XY,This is a prediction on my part as I have not had the opportunity to view the DVD's but will do so when cold weather sets in and the baseball season is over.
