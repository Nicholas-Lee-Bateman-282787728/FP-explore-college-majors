3521565,4,B001D1KGZE,"For the first time in years, I just watched a double feature of THE SKULL, directed by Freddie Francis, and THE MAN WHO CHEATED DEATH, directed by Terence Fisher, released on blu-ray this week. THE SKULL has been reviewed ever since it opened without much enthusiasm, and DEATH usually gets mentioned in passing as a lesser Fisher film. Though I am not ready to proclaim the films masterpieces, I am here to urge those interested in Hammer and Amicus productions to take a look.

Fisher works from a highly melodramatic and talky Sangster script (based on a play) that somehow never transcends the boundaries of boulevard melodrama. Fisher, knowing he has a lot of talking to get the viewer through, stages each and every dialogue beat with a choreographer's exactitude, which seems at times more fitting for opera or musical theatre than film. But taking the piece as a whole, realizing the choices Fisher made and stuck with though out, there's an extraordinary sense of directorial craft on display. Typical of Fisher, every shot, camera move, and bit of blocking keeps the action forward moving; nothing is arbitrary, nothing is wasted. Jack Asher's lush photography distills Fisher's heightened dramatic choices with very clever and well placed color diffusions and short lens compositions that at times seem to sizzle in context to the action. And, of course, Robinson's sets utilize, as always, the Hammer stock, with vivid details framing the action, supporting Fisher's storytelling style with the kind of vitality only well chosen and appropriately placed details can.  There is more to THE MAN WHO CHEATED DEATH then one might think. If nothing else, it offers us a rather nakedly displayed example of Fisher's directorial sense of craft, which in itself is worth the effort.

THE SKULL is a revelation.  Freddie Francis could be a workmanlike director who did not appreciate the flourish of melodrama the way Fisher did. Fisher could take a script filled with narrative  inconsistencies and just about any nutty idea Sangster and Elder could throw at him without wasting time on things that might draw our attention to these problems. Fisher, I think, found a way to draw the thematic from his scripts, treating the themes with a straight on seriousness that give his best films a dramatic weight missing from most others -- then and now. Fisher never condescended, whereas Francis unwittingly, I think, did. Fisher found a sense of truth in the themes he extrapolated and explored, whereas Francis merely documented action. That's why THE SKULL is so exciting; at least, watching it on blu-ray, it excited me. Am thinking it may in fact be Francis' best, most sustained work as a director.

Basically a series of long sequences without dialogue, THE SKULL comes to life, first and foremost, as an entirely visual experience. Certainly, there are dialogue scenes, but not many. The idea being, a skull, supposedly that of de Sade, is introduced into the drawing room setting of Peter Cushing's character ( a collector of macabre artifacts used for some sort of research). The skull is possessed by a demon that causes ""confusion and murder."" The story, then, is how the skull influences Cushing, tricking, manipulating, and even torturing him, until the end. The dialogue does very little to explain what indeed is happening in the film. Francis relies totally on camera moves, color, editing rhythms, dissolves, and music to communicate the film's significant action. A nightmare quality is sustained with a brilliant sense of ironically conceived moments where reality simple melds with hallucination; nightmare comes, then, in a keen and clear light, unannounced and challenging. To ""get"" the movie, one must really think about what is happening. (The whiff of Resnais in the shadow of each sequence reminded me that LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD is a twist and turn on an old horror movie concept.)  Freddie Francis, like Fisher, keeps things moving without making it feel rushed. Each image implies something and inevitably leads to something else. There is never a scene that spells it all out. That becomes the viewers' job. By the time we reach the end, the perceptive viewers realize the story we think we were watching is not really the story Francis and his screen writer have been telling. It is a remarkable film.",1304726400,12,4331,5.040502793296089
3521566,4,B001D1KGZE,"Have to pass on Man Who Could Cheat Death because I don't think I've seen it. I need a torrent here :) The Skull, however, is one of my fave 'lost' Hammer films. Didn't get much play, unfortunately, but it is an interesting film. Certainly creeped me out as a teen that found most 'horror' films to be, er, not :)",1304467200,,313,4.147540983606557
3521567,3,B001D1KGZE,"Terence Fisher's ""The Man Who Could Cheat Death"" made in 1959 is one of Fisher's lesser films. A remake of ""The Man in Half Moon Street"" it stars Anton Diffring as Dr. Georges Bonnett a talented surgeon who likes to sculpt in his spare time. Evidently he must have had plenty of spare time to learn how--he's over 100 years old yet looks like he is in his late 30's-early 40's. Jimmy Sangster's screenplay based on Barr Lyndon (""War of the Worlds"")play tends to be heavy on the melodrama and short on the thrills. It's not a bad movie as there's some stylish direction from Fisher and Christopher Lee in a supporting role and good acting on hand from Hazel Court and others. The film just lacks the thrills so central to early Hammer films.

""The Skull"" starring Peter Cushing and directed by Freddie Francis (who photographed ""The Innocents"" and ""The Elelphant Man"")is a very clever Amicus production based on a short story by Robert Bloch (author of the novel PSYCHO and a respected screenwriter as well). Featuring Christopher Lee and the late Michael Gough in suppporting roles ""The Skull"" Cushing stars as Christopher Maitland who collects ""odd"" objects such as...the skull of de Sade which exerts an evil influence on Maitland to do REALLY bad things.

The script by Amicus co-founder and producer Milton Subotsky helps raise the second feature on this set above the Hammer film.

Both films receive nice looking transfers to Blu-ray although the edge goes to ""The Skull"". ""Death"" doesn't look quite as ""lively"" as some of the more color saturated 50's transfers of Hammer films from Warner or Sony. For ""Death"" blacks aren't quite as solid as I had hoped and there are some minor digital artifacts that crop up now and again(no doubt due to the transfer).  ""The Skull"" probably could have used a bit more restoration but looks pretty good over all. I suspect that the high def masters used for the 2008 DVD releases were probably recycled here.

The one area that Legend Films could improve on its releases is to include commentary tracks from either Hammer/Amicus/horror historians and/or a retrospective featurette on both films. That would cost money of course and given that Legend has probably licensed these and put them out at a decent price probably makes it prohibitive (although if they had contacted me I would gladly have done it for free--:) ).

If you're a fan of ""Death"" you won't feel cheated by the Blu-ray release of this Hammer film. ""The Skull"" from Hammer rival Amicus is a fun mid-60's horror film although it doesn't quite match the best that Amicus (or Hammer) could do in their prime. Nevertheless, this is a good set and fans of either film will be happy to have them on Blu-ray.

If you haven't seen either film in a long time you may want to try and see if you can rent them first to see if they are as good as you remember them but if you already have the DVD and want to upgrade these are pretty good upgrades although both could have used a bit more digital restoration.",1304380800,14,3008,4.664150943396226

3521571,5,B001D1KGZE,"I really enjoyed watching this film I did not know as a kid. It has no much action compared with other Hammer entries around this time (Horror of Dracula, Curse of Frankenstein). However, the film is really good at a more philosophical side as it deals with the positive and negative considerations of achieving eternal life. These two sides are illustrated by a partneship of two fellow scientists. On top of this you get the character played by the great Christopher Lee. This last aspect makes worth enough to get a copy of this DVD release. Except for the first 3 min or so, the digital transfer is pretty good. The film is close captioned in English and no extras are available except for a scene selection tool.",1229040000,10,717,4.609375

I believe if you go online now, you will see that it is available.  The title is on full release now, which means as Amazon runs out of stock, they will place a reorder and it should never be more than a 3-4 day backorder for the title.

Forced to uproot himself before every operation he now wants to end his life of loneliness by subjecting the woman he loves to this procedure. Christopher Lee and Hazel Court head the cast of this entertaining film. The picture quality isn't superb but considering its age it is adequate.

3521581,5,B001D1KGZE,"After revitalizing the horror genre in 1957 with the Curse of Frankenstein, Hammer Studios went on to make a string of classic horror movies. Universal Studios stopped making horror movies in 1948, with Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein, and the horror genre did not fare well between 1948 and 1957. The success of the 1957 Frankenstein remake showed the larger studios that horror films could still sell, but I'm getting off topic. The Man Who Could Cheat Death is an example of hammer studios during their prime. Terence Fisher directs Anton Diffring, Hazel Court, and of course Christopher Lee in a very entertaining story, that I believe was ahead of its time for 1959. The actors gave fine performances, the settings were classic Hammer and the only thing missing was Peter Cushing. The film explores the theme of immortality, and I give it points for originality in dreaming up the most painful death. While getting pummeled by Frankenstein's monster is painful, *spoiler alert* the death in The man who could cheat death is more unique in that the death was 104 years of sickness and aging condensed into a single moment. The movie also addresses some philosophical issues, such as should a technique to provide perpetual health and life be hidden or exposed to the public. Overall, I love hammer films, especially earlier ones, and I think this movie is great. (for 1959) Oh yeah, if you need another reason to watch, I have two words for you; Hazel Court.

3521589,4,B001D1KGZE,"After the worldwide success of CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA, Hammer was eagerly looking for more black & white horror material that they could remake in color. While waiting to redo the 1935 WEREWOLF OF LONDON (as the 1961 CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF with Oliver Reed) and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (in 1962 with Herbert Lom), they acquired the rights to the 1945 Paramount thriller THE MAN IN HALF MOON STREET about a scientist who has discovered ""the fountain of youth"". The result was THE MAN WHO COULD CHEAT DEATH. In exchange Paramount got the exclusive rights for American distribution when the film was released in 1959. Like (HORROR OF) DRACULA, CHEAT uses the more expensive three strip Technicolor process which gives the film a vivid, highly stylized look that is perfect for a story set in late 19th century Paris. The way the colors are deployed recalls John Huston's 1952 film MOULIN ROUGE. The score by celebrated British composer Richard Rodney Bennett is also a plus.

German actor Anton Diffring (also in CIRCUS OF HORRORS released the same year) stars as Dr Georges Bonnet, a sculptor and scientist who happens to be over 100 years old but looks 35. Hazel Court, previously in CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, portrays Bonner's muse/model/lover. Her posing scene raised more than a few eyebrows back in 1959. Christopher Lee also appears in one of his earliest good guy roles for Hammer. The screenplay by Hammer regular Jimmy Sangster retains the basic plot of HALF MOON STREET but Sangster emphasizes the more horrific elements of the story and makes a number of key changes. Director Terence Fisher and art director Bernard Robinson use the old school Technicolor to create stunning visual effects that are highly artistic. The film is a feast for the eyes especially in the green transformation scenes which recall the opening of Paramount's 1940 mad doctor flick DR. CYCLOPS. Some will find it rather talky and not very scary but old school horror fans will find a lot to enjoy.",1381449600,4,1990,4.887573964497041

3521600,4,B001D1KGZE,"The Man Who Cheated Death

First Impressions:

This was one of the few Hammer films I have seen where Christopher Lee plays a sophisticated good guy in this fascinating horror film.  This film is a remake of ""The Man in Half Moon Street"" (1945).

Georges Bonnet is on the hunt for glands!  He sneaks around at night and kills the occasional person to get the gland and replenishes the one in his body -- after all, he is not getting any older at 104!  And he doesn't look a day over 35!

He tires of going from place to place to change his identity before anyone notices that he does not age.  Sadly, he goes into a rage and turns green with an acid touch if he does not get his gland or, a liquid substitute.

Story & Plot:  I really liked the acting of Anton Diffring as Bonnet.  He has an intense stare and is somewhat crazy to begin with, so the character really comes through as a frustrated, lonely man who, though he has discovered a way to immortality (at the expense of others), has no love.

Christopher Lee plays a surgeon who is slated to take over for another surgeon (Bonnet's pal) who was unexpectedly killed by Bonnet when challenged about the immorality of his quest for immortality.  Oops!

There's a minor love story in there somewhere, kinda slapped together.  The fun is in the horror. :)

The ending is quite ironic.  A must-see!

8290942,4,B001D1KGZE,"Just got this as a birthday gift to myself. I am a fan of Hazel Court and anything she is in gives me a chance to catch her beauty on screen. She did a great job in this movie, as she always does.
She was in a Season 5 episode of the original ""Twilight Zone"" series by Rod Serling. That was excellent as well.
Christopher Lee stars in this movie as well and have been a big fan of his for many years since his debut as ""The Horror of Dracula"" with Peter Cushing.
Anton Diffring (Where Eagles Dare), plays the man who literally tries and cheats death by drinking this special potion that prolongs his life. If he doesn't have it every 6 hours, precisely, his body starts to age rapidly.

I liked the movie, but I think either Kino Lorber or Hammer didn't do much to this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love to have it for Hazel Court alone, but I think the Blu-ray release could have looked better, overall.
I played this back on a UHD 4K TV with a Sony upscaling Blu-ray player. The image came out 2160p, but it looked like it was  DVD quality. Colors were not as vibrant as I would have expected from a new Blu-ray release of this movie. Yes, 1959, but I have movies from that era that look better in HD.
The special features are great!

8290943,5,B001D1KGZE,"I loved watching Hazel Court and Anton Diffring in The Man Who Could Cheat Death. The script is a little too wordy, but the acting makes up for it. The blu-ray transfer is as good as you can expect. It's not like Hammer took any real effort to preserve their original films. The Skull - well the five stars goes without saying. Sure the plot is silly, but the movie is fun!",1504569600,,373,4.194444444444445
8290944,4,B001D1KGZE,"Two good thrillers and keepers. However, ""The Skull"" as good as it was turns into a comedy at the end because you can see the wires attached to the skull. I wish the publisher would have altered the video so you can't see the wires.",1500940800,,232,4.177777777777778

8290946,4,B001D1KGZE,"The Man Who Could Cheat Death,"" the 1959 Hammer Studios remake of The Man in Half-Moon Street (1945), takes place in Paris in 1890. Dr. Georges Bonnet (Anton Diffring), a surgeon and amateur sculptor, remains youthful by taking a special serum and having a series of gland operations every ten years from living donors. The donors are young women he employs as models for his sculpting, and he has romantic designs on one of them, Janine (Hazel Court).

Though he looks to be 35, Bonnet is actually 104. Because Bonnets regular surgeon is too old to operate anymore, he is training Pierre Gerrard (Christopher Lee) to continue the periodic surgeries that will maintain Bonnets immortality. As Bonnet struggles against the inevitable grip of death, he begins a descent into madness that threatens not only the lives of those he cares for the most, but the very laws of nature.

The plot combines elements of The Picture of Dorian Gray and House of Wax, and contains the signature Gothic look of Hammer films of the period. The studio was riding the crest of popularity with its Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958), and was turning out one successful horror film after another. The Man Who Could Cheat Death doesnt have famous monsters, but does a more than capable job with the mad doctor theme. Diffring is impressive as a man desperate that he might become susceptible to mortality when his regimen of unorthodox treatments is threatened.

Though not first-tier Hammer, the movie is well acted, boasts lush production design, and is directed by Terence Fisher with a flair for creating an atmosphere of malevolence.

Special features on the widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentary by film historian Troy Howorth, interview with critic and novelist Kim Newman, interview with author and historian Jonathan Rigby, and movie trailers.",1488931200,,1856,5.055555555555555

Terence Fisher directs this over-looked 1959 Hammer film. Bonnett is a talented surgeon who likes to mold statues of beautiful women. the problem is he is 104 but.in his late 30's-early 40's. Jimmy Sangster's screenplay based on a play by British playwright,  Barr Lyndon (""War of the Worlds""). The movie is heavy on melodrama and part-mystery/part-science fiction/part-horror film. The supporting cast of Hazel Court (the love interest), Christoher Lee and Arnold Marle provide good support in a thrilling tale that is light on horror.",1477267200,,670,5.380952380952381
