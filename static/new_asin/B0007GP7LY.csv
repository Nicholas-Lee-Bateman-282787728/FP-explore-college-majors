2212002,5,B0007GP7LY,"My wife and I were thrilled to find The Creation on DVD, having worn out our copy on VHS. A fabulous visualization of the poem by James Weldon Johnson, we showed this in children's church years ago and the kids loved it. When it illustrated the ""God created man in His own image"" by showing a series of multi-race/age/gender faces morph from one to another (long before Michael Jackson used the idea for his video), one of the African-American kids jumped up and said excitedly ""You mean God looks like me?!"" Wonderful narration by James Earl Jones and terrific music by David Friesen.",1233187200,6,585,4.689320388349515
2212003,3,B0007GP7LY,"Fred Waring did an LP of God's Trombones back in the 50s, which was really beautiful.  I'll buy this version, (I'll give it a 3-star rating till I get it) but I certainly hope the Waring LP will appear on CD sometime before the Angel of death makes them obsolete!",1223683200,2,263,4.26
2212004,5,B0007GP7LY,"I wanted these voices giving these sermons and I decided to get it even though it was clay-mation--knowing the picture would not be middle road video--Clay is good or baaaad.  This disk is well above the good mark--touching on spectacular.  My advice:
1. Buy it.
2. Find box of tissues
3. Turn the sound way up on a good system
4. Brace yourself for an EXPERIENCE you will not soon forget.",1204243200,6,389,4.464788732394366
2212005,4,B0007GP7LY,"This is a wonderful collection of James Weldon Johnson's poetry. I use his ""Creation"" poem as a powerful interpretation of the ""Creation"" story. This African-American poet deserves a place as one of the great poets on the American scene.",1171670400,13,237,5.102564102564102
2212006,5,B0007GP7LY,"I was pleased to see this volume finally make it to DVD. I've appreciated the African-American Poem Sermons of James Weldon Johnson ever since I first heard a reading of his ""The Creation"" in High School Speech class. POWERFUL stuff. The DVD includes three of the original seven poem-sermons from Johnson's 1927 book God's Trombones. Included are The Creation, The Prodigal Son and Go Down Death (a funeral sermon). Missing are Listen Lord,  Noah Built The Ark, The Crucifixion, Let My People Go, and Judgment Day. I'd seen the VHS years ago, and was impressed at the time. Wil Vinton clay-animates the three stories. If you fell in love with his California Raisins, expect something different. These shorts aren't quite so polished (I'm guessing they were made earlier in Vinton's career). But they are much more artful. Especially The Creation and Go Down Death, which are clay-animated on flat sheets of glass, so that they look like swirling, textured oil paintings. The Prodigal Son (recognized by the familiar line ""your arm's too short to box with God"") is animated in classic claymation style--three dimensional figures moving through three dimensional scenes. The Creation and The Prodigal Son are great for seeing old, familiar Bible stories from a new, eye-opening perspective. And Go Down Death offers a true spiritual epiphany--imagining death as a benevolent angel of God who is sent to ease the pain of an ancient dying woman. He is her ticket to paradise and the arms of a loving Father. I'm sure the finer (deeper) details will be lost on small children. And Go Down Death is a little scary. But for kids seven and up (as well as for families, Bible Study discussion groups, and even use in worship), these three stories are valuable, must-experience viewing.",1170288000,26,1776,4.97979797979798

8047422,5,B0007GP7LY,"These story/sermons are very well done, with different styles of claymation. The creation story is especially beautiful, and the prodigal son has very good music. The most moving one for me, though, is ""Go down death.""",1439251200,2,218,5.083333333333333
8047423,4,B0007GP7LY,"I was disappointed that it only covers 3 of the 7 sermons. The description in your advertisement does not make that clear. What is presented is done very well.

8047428,5,B0007GP7LY,If you like to listen to Gods stories in a different format that consist of clay animation. Then you should purchase God's Trombones for your family because the stories are wonderful.,1365465600,,183,4.935483870967742
8047429,4,B0007GP7LY,"How can the creation story in the Book of Genesis be realized in living images?  This DVD answers that question - and the form is like a beautifully illustrated children's book moving in free-flowing oil paints narrated by the low, powerful, regal voice of James Earl Jones.  True, the narrative words are derived from an African American sermon which James Weldon Johnson delivered in the 1920's, not the Book of Genesis itself, but the words effectively communicate the majesty of God's original work.  This movie establishes the power of poetry - read aloud.

When I think of God creating the heavens, the earth, the sun, and the animals, these are the images I remember.  Even after 30 years.

The other stories in the collection are told in claymation...interesting but not earth shaking.  Get the DVD for the James Earl Jones short film.  Do not be put off by the artwork on the cover of this DVD - it is the story of the Prodigal Son, not the Creation of the World.  I agree with some of the other commentators that the story ""Go Down Death"" could be frightening to small children, a curious choice for this collection of shorts intended for young people.

I do treasure the James Earl Jones part of the movie set.",1361232000,2,1221,4.637209302325582
