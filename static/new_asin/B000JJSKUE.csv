8211443,5,B000JJSKUE,The Corrs weren't even a part of the concert. This is one of the most phenomenal concerts I've ever seen in my life. Bar none. A true example of Global Gumbo-- not your average boring pop concert.,1173312000,,196,4.324324324324325
8211444,1,B000JJSKUE,"I bought this for only one reason. I collect the Corrs. There is no mention anywhere on the DVD of the Corrs and after watching everything, including the extras, they were nowhere to be seen or heard. This was badly edited and other artists were cut out including Alicia Keys, although she did make an appearance in ""The making of.."" .

It's over 2 hours of mainly foreign performers, mostly Italian (it was afterall in Rome}. So if you are American, you probably only know of Carlos Santana (who doesn't)and possibly Zachuro? (not sure I spelled that right but he has had Sharon Corr play violin with him}. The former having the most time alloted on this disc.

Seeing it once was more than enough for me!!

Anyone want to buy a used one really cheap ???",1170720000,,755,4.4963503649635035
