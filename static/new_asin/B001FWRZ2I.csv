3589337,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I just become interested on Sarah when listening to ""Love song"". I bought the CD abd the this DVD came. Excellent performance and voice. She has a lot of talent. This DVD is very good since it shows a closer look to sarah personal side",1237852800,2,235,4.2444444444444445
3589338,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Saw her last year before this came out...and she was FABULOUS. Such wonderful energy, and her ""live"" performane on the DVD is a great opportunity for me to re-live it. When she has the chance to ""record"" again...I'll be first in line to buy a new album! It may be odd to some, but when I read a series of books, I listen to an artist for each book. Her ""Little Voice"" album became the background,(theme...if you will) for Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series. (Yes. I listened to it through the thousands of pages all 6 books...and I will listen to it again when ""An Echo in the Bone"" comes out later this year!)",1236297600,,611,4.415929203539823
3589339,4,B001FWRZ2I,"Sara Bareilles is awesome. Nuff said.  The dvd contains a lot of cool features, including an extra live cd based on the dvd. The dvd is a really nice feature, with both excellent video and audio quality.",1231632000,,203,4.486486486486487
3589340,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I got this as a gift for my girlfriend.  She has been going to Bareilles shows for the past 4-5 years and when she opened the present she was really excited.  We watched it she really liked al the songs they played, and I thought that the DVD was put together really well.

It is Sara Bareilles live at the Fillmore in San Francisco, but during the performance, the dvd cuts away between songs and you get to hear little tid bit from Sara about how she came out with the ideas for the songs, and see a little behind the scenes things.

So if you are a Sara Bareilles fan, or you know someone that is, this is a great purchase that I would highly recommend.",1229817600,17,656,4.141732283464567
3589341,5,B001FWRZ2I,If you don't know Sara Bareilles you will after seeing this DVD. She is an amazing talent and this live show at the Fillmore in San Francisco is  beautifully filmed and has great sound! You will love her!,1229040000,2,204,4.368421052631579
3589342,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I purchased Sara Bareilles' ""Little Voice"" CD last April & was very impressed, but being an old school music fan of 50 years, I always judge a performer by a live performance. I live in Buffalo, NY & recently passed on going to see Sara in Cleveland in early November & after watching the DVD, I'm so sorry I did. This gal has one hell of a voice !!!!! As good as ""Little Voice"" is, it only tells part of the story. In this live performance, Sara B. takes full advantage of the live setting & shows off her very smooth jazz flavorings, her ability to make a quiet ballad very dynamic & she can also belt it out when she has to. And by the way, she also kicks a-- on piano. Unfortunatly in todays music, theres not alot of real artists out there, but I put Sara up there with someone like KT Tunstall, another one of the few left in a rare breed.",1228608000,15,845,4.096385542168675
3589343,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Purchased as a Christmas gift and listened to it as well... very beautiful, diverse songs.  Song-bird voice.  No wonder Sara is called a SongBird.  Highly recommended.  Hope she's on the next season of ""Sing Off""!",1325116800,,213,5.0
3589344,5,B001FWRZ2I,"If you've never listened to Sara Bareilles, you're missing out.  This is the perfect opportunity to have your mind TOTALLY blown by her brilliance... go on now. Buy this!",1319932800,,170,4.862068965517241
3589345,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Sound quality is perfect!  I actuallly bought this as a gift for my fiance, and I love it now!
Sara has an awesome stage presence and a voice to match!",1299888000,,151,4.033333333333333
3589346,5,B001FWRZ2I,I was very pleased with the product.  I selected fast shipping and paid extra thinking it would come quicker but it didn't seem like it did.  But overall I love it and it was in very good condition.,1291939200,,198,4.184210526315789
3589347,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I defy anyone to name a better music DVD out there. We are fortunate that Sara is a current artist because when it comes to music DVD's, they need to be shot in the last 10 years for it to even have a chance of having it sound good. Any digitally remasted music dvd of a past artist is a waste of money, they universally sound completely awful. It amazes me that even DVD's shot in recent years don't have great sound quality. That should be the most important thing, and amazingly it seems like it is not. And that should be the first thing commented on in a review of a DVD, funny how it is not. You don't have to worry here, the sound quality is the best I have seen out of any music dvd.

So not only is the sound quality superb, but the filming of this was excellent. The video quality is very nice. You don't have an out of control camera person thinking that they can add something to the dvd with crazy shots and camera work. The way the housebout footage was mixed in with the concert footage was very well done.

And then there is Sara, what can you say. In my opinion, she is the best artist all time. There might be other artists with more unique and or memorable voices. But there is no other artist that puts it all together like Sara. I can listen to this DVD over and over, and there is only 1 song(fairytale) out of the 12 that I don't listen to over and over. How many artist have that many good songs, and are this unknown. It is kind of nice that she is still kind of underground. She is so genuine, and so refreshing as she speaks her mind and is not like all of the untalented pop stars that the media crowns as talented. Sara is so soulful and seems like she really enjoys performing. She rocks on the piano, and Javier Dunn on the electric guitar is unbelivable(Love on the Rocks and City might be two of the best songs ever).

This is the best music dvd out there period !!!!",1275350400,3,1900,4.129729729729729
3589348,5,B001FWRZ2I,Sara Bareilles is a special talent that should not go un noticed by anyone at any age. This DVD is great. A great concert by a wonderfully talented singer/song writer and performer. She is as beautiful as she is talented and this show is the perfect presentation of her music and her soul. Buy this DVD! You'll love it.,1261180800,,319,4.423728813559322
3589349,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I bought Sara's studio version of this cd, called Little Voice, but after previewing the live version ""Between the Lines"", I knew I HAD to add this to my collection as well!! And together with now having the dvd and bonus cd, it has taken my appreciation for her as an artist through the roof and to another level.
As I watched the dvd what came across is how authentic and personable she is. Not to mention the stellar quality of the live recording, nothing of her musicality was compromised, and again the amount of editing is perfect - there is a perfect blend of live stage performance/ outdoor performance and talk time. All in all she leaves you wanting to play it over and over again.",1259280000,,691,4.448818897637795
3589350,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live at The Fillmore was a joy to watch. I love her album, Little Voice and I was curious about this DVD. Glad I made this purchase, this live concert is entertaining and moving. Sara's voice is just as strong as it is on the album, no studio Barbie Doll - she can sing her face off!! Gravity is my favorite song and she definitely does the gorgeous ballad justice. I highly recommend this amazing DVD, enjoy!",1251936000,,443,4.414634146341464
3589351,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Sara played her cd Little Voice LIVE in an quite excellent performance. This is better than the studio version. As other guys reviews mention, the dvd/bonus cd has many bonus material that gives you a good insight about this young woman, who is an excellent singer, songwriter/composer, quite charming and funny. If you really want to know if someone is good, watch them in a live performance. She performs like she owns the stage. Reaches every note and gives a new dimension to her material from Little Voice. In City, it reminds me of B. Hornsby music, and she is quite a piano player whose songs have a great beat. I watched and listened to this concert in my computer with my earphones, to flavor every single sound coming from her performance. Her new composition shows she has some great stuff coming, which sadly is not out. Come on Sarah we want more music from you!",1245196800,4,875,4.615384615384615
3589352,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Concert DVDs seem to be going through a bit of a re-realizing here lately. It's rarely just a concert with some bonus footage anymore. More times than not you're greeted with a type of 'follow me while I go on tour' mini biography. Which is completely fine with me. I always like knowing artists I like are down to earth.

Enter Sara Bareilles' Between The Line.

I thoroughly enjoyed Little Voice, and still do on occassion. I didn't expect a concert DVD from her though. For one, I didn't think (and still really don't) her catalog was big enough for a DVD. Not to mention that I really didn't think her fanbase was as big as it actually is (silly me).

HOWEVER! If you're a charismatic performer, it really doesn't matter if you don't even have a full CD available, if you put on a good show people will pay attention. That's where Sara Bareilles shines. She commands attention, not only because of her attitude, but also because her voice is just insanely perfect and powerful. Good thing, even though she still has a full band backing her, you can hear her voice perfectly. I know of a few bands that have released DVDs recently that has the music overpowering the vocals which is nothing short of aggrivating.

Now I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be some Sara B. purist and tell you what is new, what's an old demo, or anything. All I know is that I love this package. In fact, I'd rather listen to Between The Line over Little Voice. The production is studio quality so really the only thing that reminds you that this is a live recording (when you're listening to the audio CD) is when you hear the crowd in certain spots and when Sara B. stops and talks for a short time.

So, in closing, check this out. It's worth every penny. It's rare for me to prefer a live recording over a studio, so that says something. Because I know each reader will without a doubt listen to me. Recommended.",1241222400,,1901,4.42

(and player of piano and guitar.)

i LOVE the song August Moon, and a couple of the others on here.

i give this one as a gift often.

also- Sara is a real girl.

- that's always nice.

oh, it's interspersed with a documentary type thing.
it's nice.
some really good insight into Her, and musician things...

i think You'll Like it. :))",1380672000,,366,4.231884057971015
8302831,5,B001FWRZ2I,"Anytime a singer and her band can play music live that sounds better than the recording studio version, it says a lot about the true nature of their artistry. A young Jackson Browne had this ability. Truly amazing ability.",1368748800,,222,4.717948717948718
8302832,5,B001FWRZ2I,"This is a great DVD and great accompanying CD!  Love to hear an artist performing live and Sara Bareilles is an amazing young artist far above the crowd of ""pop tarts"" in her generation.",1364083200,,186,4.470588235294118

8302834,5,B001FWRZ2I,If you like Sara Bareilles you'll love this DVD.  She sounds so wonderful live and it's great to have her live in your own living room.  She also gives you some behind the scenes information throughout which is nice to see.,1357430400,,223,4.414634146341464
8302835,5,B001FWRZ2I,"I love this album!

Sara is a very talented musician and singer.  If you like Joni Mitchell you will like Sara Barreilles.

I prefer this album to Little Voice. Most of the songs are the same, but I like the live versions better.

You get two disks.  One for just audio, and a video of the live performance.
I have not watched the video yet. I sure I will like it though.",1352764800,,371,4.097222222222222
