6426394,4,B00KH4PZZO,"The rebellious youth's achieving enlightenment thru the tough love ministrations of the military is pretty old hat as a movie trope. In 1956 Tab Hunter presented us with another take of this with THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND. It's the second pairing - after The Burning Hills - of Hunter and Natalie Wood, two young actors Warner Brothers was determined to make into the latest heartthrob screen couple. As you can tell by how you never think of these two when the topic of immortal screen lovers surfaces, Warner Brothers failed miserably in this one ambition.

Tab Hunter in real life enlisted in the Coast Guard at the age of 15, worked at a horse riding academy, and was a competitive figure skater - all these demanding activities define him as the exact opposite of a sloth. But a sloth is what he plays in THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND. Young Andy Sheaffer (Hunter) has coasted all his life, has been mollycoddled by his indulgent parents, never mind that Andy's hard-working sweetheart Susan (Wood) believes that indolence is a vice. Susan herself is putting herself thru college by working as a part-time switchboard operator. She is in all ways wise and practical, except when it comes to Andy. She loves him quite a bit and so overlooks his flaws.

But even someone as starry-eyed as Susan can be starry-eyed for only so long. One day Andy's cute comments - such as ""Doing nothing and doing it gracefully is an art"" - stops sounding so cute. It's a sign of the times when even someone as industrious as Susan can drop a comment like ""I don't intend to go on working forever. How would you support me?"" You'd think her putting on the breaks in their relationship would serve as an eye-opener for Andy. No, it catapults him to a downspiraling path. To quote the film's wry voiceover narrator: ""For a healthy male college student, an 'F' on an examination paper is the shortest distance from the classroom and the draft board.""

Can Uncle Sam shape up our recalcitrant recruit? Andy Sheaffer finds himself a U.S. Army trooper in Fort Ord, assigned to Dog Company in the 11th Infantry regiment. We learn immediately that Andy Sheaffer and Army camp life go together like the blind and a staring contest. Give Andy some credit for persistence. He clings to his mule-headed ways like a born champ. Shockingly, he seems to be winning the tug-of-war against the Army, despite his instructors' best efforts, despite his constantly accruing punishment detail. More often than not, you can find him straining grease traps and scrubbing barracks walls, and always with a snarky comment or two just to let you know that you haven't really gotten to him. He remains incorrigible, intractable, to the extent that his superior officer gives up on him and begins the process of his dishonorable discharge. While that's up in the air, Dog Company becomes part of a massive military operation codenamed Exercise Jackhammer, to which Andy - who at this stage pretty much estranged from everyone - dismissively remarks: ""Exercise Jackhammer. I don't think I'll go."" Except that Exercise Jackhammer would prove to be Andy Sheaffer's last shot at redemption. If he wants it.

I'll always like Tab Hunter best for Damn Yankees in which he demonstrates that he can sing something other than ""Young Love."" His All-American good looks made him an instant teen dreamboat. I thought he wasn't that bad as an actor. Natalie Wood outacts him, but Natalie Wood is an accomplished performer. I liked this movie. Tab Hunter's role makes it a challenge for the movie audience to like him, but he exudes this sense that there's something redeemable about him. I stuck around to see how the turnaround would happen, to see if Andy Sheaffer could become a contributing Private in the peacetime Army. I also stuck around for Natalie Wood and because I went to boot camp decades ago, and I'm ever a sucker for nostalgia. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.",1404604800,4,3913,4.758468335787923
8658561,4,B00KH4PZZO,"It was a decent movie with a lot of stars in it.  I found it comical to see some actors in roles I never would have expected like Jim Backus (Gilligan's Island) and Murray Hamilton (Jaws) in commanding roles yelling at the troops.  I thought Henry Jones was miscast in his role playing an older recruit who claims he was a war veteran and seemed out of place with the younger recruits.  He would have been better suited in another role.

I purchased it because I was stationed at Fort Ord about 20 years later and I wanted to see what it looked like in the 1950's.  I also like Natalie Wood and Tab Hunter and knew they would give a great performance.

[SPOILER ALERT]
I would have given it five stars, but I think the plot was a little weak and the ending didn't make a lot of sense.  It was like something was missing and seemed unrealistic when Tab Hunter's character goes from a flunky recruit about to be discharged to a position of authority over new recruits.",1512432000,,966,4.333333333333333

8658564,4,B00KH4PZZO,"I became a fan of Tab Hunter after seeing Tab Hunter Confidential. I'm slowly making my way through his films that I can find streaming. This is a B-Movie that reminded me of an MST3K episode. But I love MST3K, LOL. Keep that in mind going into it (that it's a B-Movie, not that I love MST3K), and consider the era when it was made.",1468800000,,332,4.123076923076923
