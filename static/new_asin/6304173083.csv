I commented on it in one of my other reviews-which songs it had in it and so on.  I really hope you can find it for me.  Thanks, Janice Revet",1354060800,,258,3.792452830188679

7863617,2,6304173083,"This review is based on Volume 1 of this Television Classics set of 3 volumes in total.

The title says BETTY BOOP 8 FULL LENGTH EPISODES 8 SHOWS ON 1 DVD. If you are like me, then you'll be under the impression you are getting 8 Betty Boop cartoons. This is NOT so! The first 5 are indeed Boop but the last 3 are various other cartoons. This DVD contains:
1 Henry - Betty leaves Henry in charge of her pet shop
2 Another Little King - The King joins Betty in her show
3 No! No! No! A Thousand Times No! - Someone attempts to woo Betty away from Freddie
4 Making Stars - Betty showcases future stars in her show
5 Is My Palm Read - Betty visits the fortune teller
6 Parrotville Old Folks - A cartoon about parrots
7 Happy Harmonies - An MGM cartoon about Spring
8 A Day At The Zoo - An a.a.p Merrie Melodies cartoon (Incidentally, this was the funniest out of all on this DVD)

This is a basic DVD that comes in a cardboard sleeve (i.e. no artwork), also there is no real 'Menu' to speak of...it just leads in to the list of the 8 cartoons. There is no 'Play All' option so you have to play each one individually. The sound is crisp and clear and the picture is as clear as it can be considering the age of the films. You DO however get the ""film look"" - the hairlines and black dots that appear from time to time throughout old films. Gives it that nostalgic feeling I think.

I decided to place this on here because considering that I felt cheated of 3 cartoons, I can't imagine it will be better on the second or third DVDs. Hope this helps.",1208822400,,1544,4.072368421052632
7863618,1,6304173083,"The title of this DVD is misleading. Of the eight cartoons, only the first five are Betty Boop. The other three are irrelevant. The quality of the picture is poor.",1144627200,,163,4.466666666666667

Although mild compared to what we see at the movies and on TV today, it is still a significant mile-stone in the evolution of the art. I only wish they were on DVD. The video transfer is as good as can be expected, and I was pleasently surprised at the LFE content, intended or not.",1020988800,4,326,4.030769230769231

On top of that, the picture quality is so sharp you can't believe you're watching cartoons made in 1929.",994896000,8,281,4.875
