7037306,5,B00UGPA94Q,"For those who choose to remember Lawrence Taylor as the most dominant player of his time--and not, you know, a loser who allegedly pays underage girls to sleep with him--then buy this DVD.",1273276800,,188,4.7272727272727275

7037308,5,B00UGPA94Q,I bought this DVD for a friend as a Christmas present.  He is a huge Giants fan and LOVES this DVD.,1230508800,,99,3.7142857142857144
7037309,4,B00UGPA94Q,For current but especially past fans this is an excellent trip down memory lane with a team with a great tradition. Well worth the time to see and see again.,1230336000,,157,4.266666666666667
7037310,5,B00UGPA94Q,There's plenty of superbowl coverage to make anyone who grew up in the 80's or 90's a happy camper.  Also lot's of history dating back to the team's inception.  Worth the amazon price.  DEFINITELY worth the $12.99 I paid to amazon just before the holidays (what a difference a superbowl makes),1205280000,,293,4.705882352941177
7037311,5,B00UGPA94Q,"This DVD is great for any Giant fan.
Yeah there is some recycled footage that we have all seen before but the extra footage is excellent.
I just wish it came out a few years later to capture Eli in his first few years.
Other than that i love it and watch parts of it at least a couple times a week",1194998400,,297,3.806451612903226
7037312,2,B00UGPA94Q,"I have loved the Giants for more than 30 years.  Therefore, I was very disappointed that most of this footage is recycled from old NFL Film productions.  I estimate less than 10 minutes of new footage here.  (If you have ""Giants Among Men"" from 1987 and the 1991 highlight film following Superbowl XXV, you pretty-much already own 75% of this DVD set.)

When I heard they were releasing a ""History of the NY Giants"", I was hoping for actual game footage, complete with TV-announcers commentary.

I own boxed sets in other major sports: basketball, hockey, baseball, that show complete games as they originally aired on television.  These are perfect for reliving some great sports moments as they actually happened.  The drama is not created through movie-production, but rather through the course of the actual event:  See Mets game 6; the Rangers game 7 etc.

Unfortunately, no luck whatsoever in this area.  For whatever reason, NFL Films has always believed that drama is created in the editing room and in the music studio rather than on the field itself.  What you get here is standard NFL films: painfully-drawn-out slow motion, and countless (and I mean countless) close-ups of spiraling footballs set to dramatic classical music.  The drama and heart pounding memories of Superbowl XXV are reduced to a 20 second overview, followed by the most rediculously drawn-out shot of Norwood's field-goal.  (You can basically go to the bathroom and make it back in time to see the ball sail wide-right.)  Over and over, the thrill of the moment/memory is completely lost in the over-production.

I would pay good money for high-quality DVD's of actual game broadcasts of the greatest Giant victories of all time.  Giant fans will enjoy much of this, so it deserves a few stars.  However, ultimately this was a lost opportunity to capture the history of a remarkable franchise.",1160352000,37,1876,4.980707395498392
7037313,5,B00UGPA94Q,"Another superb NFL Films production. The Giants 1958 and 1986 Championship Games were awesome and exciting. I have viewed the complete History of the NY Giants, Raiders, Cowboys, Packers, & Eagles. I am not a fan of any of thoses teams. But, this production and the others are a must for any NFL FAN. On the bonus disc where as a half dozen retired players are interviewed, Some of the interviews were to short. The Pat Summerall interview will touch your heart. Concerning all 5 teams I've watched, the bonus disc interviews all have some that seem to short. In addition, I feel there could have been another half dozen past players interviewed and added. I'm Very Happy with this purchase and all the other team purchases and I'm sure whomever is reading this and buys any of these will be very pleased with what you get. Myself being an Avid NFL fan for about 50 years, I've seen a tremendous amount of film footage. With these Team History Productions, it seems you get the best of the best footage, along with the memories that go with them.",1122163200,33,1046,4.569148936170213
7037314,5,B00UGPA94Q,I bought this movie for a friend of mine that is a New York Giants fan. I gave him a few days to watch both discs then asked him what he thought about it. He said it was EXCELLANT. I'm pretty sure he liked it. He even asked me to look and see if I could find a couple of other games for him. Which I did and saved them to my wish list to buy at a later date. I would recommend this to and New York Giants fan or any football fan.,1377475200,,429,3.574468085106383
7037315,5,B00UGPA94Q,"Man i tell you i just like the way it all came to be, the history just ""BLUE"" my mind !!!!!!",1376092800,,92,3.4285714285714284
7037316,4,B00UGPA94Q,I bought this DVD used like new for $10 with postage and it was an excellant condition. I also bought this DVD for the Special feature on the 1958 Championship game only. I already have the complete History Of the NY Giants in Blue Ray which includes from 1925 to Superbowl 46. It sad to seee your Giants loose and to know that the baltimore Colts spied on Giants practices but it was still worth the 10 dollars.,1366502400,,412,4.294871794871795
7037317,5,B00UGPA94Q,"saw it with a long-time Giants fan, lots of details and film clips from the early years as well as up until now.  Learned that a Giants player invented the touchdown spike and the Gatorade bath, didn't know that",1357344000,,211,4.410256410256411
7037318,5,B00UGPA94Q,"This is a must-have for any die hard Giants fan. With Eli, we may need a second issue but it's a valued part of my Giants library.",1356739200,,130,3.8518518518518516
7037319,5,B00UGPA94Q,"This DVD contains a nice history of the Giants, which is quite enjoyable to view. However, I especially love the presentation of ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" That's primarily why I bought it and certainly was not disappointed. Just having the game itself is worth the money spent here.",1352592000,,289,4.918367346938775
7037320,5,B00UGPA94Q,Love this. It's a collectors item. My husband enjoyed it too and he's been a NYG fan over 50 years. Great high quality footage and even looks good on our HD TV playing on PS3.,1331164800,,175,4.0285714285714285
7037321,5,B00UGPA94Q,"I'd purchased quite a few of the ""America's Game"" sets, including the Giants, so I wasn't sure what to expect with this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's extremely well done, like all NFL Network productions seem to be.  If you are a Giants fan, this gives you a great story on the beginnings, all the way up until just before the Superbowl with the Ravens...which I'm kinda glad they didn't show that because it was quite a painful Superbowl to watch.  But anyway, I was very happy with this and would recommend it to any Giants fan, young or old.",1325289600,,554,4.455445544554456
7037322,4,B00UGPA94Q,I purchased The New York Giants-The Complete History dvds as a gift for a fellow Giants fan who enjoys it very much. It makes a great gift for Giants fans!,1316995200,,155,4.2

8705629,5,B00UGPA94Q,"Before you purchase just know: This is before the 2007 and 2011 Championships.  The New Edition released after 2011 contains footage of both. HOWEVER, this means there's more older footage most likely since NFL Films team histories are all around the same length.
  The second disc is that stupid 1958 loss in the Championship ""Greatest Ever Played"" is really, really pushing it. I don't know why NFL films worships that sloppy game so much. Something about being on Teevee being so new, football not really televised, and most people's first NFL Game or something.  But its just a slopfest.
  I gave it the 5 stars because the NY Giants history is great, full of NFL Films highlights. NFL Films makes even boring games fascinating, will show you 1986 Dominance and 1990's improbable run to glory.
  Beware old men telling you football stinks today, it was better in the past, tougher, whatever...I own an archive of old games...Fact: 90% of old games as late as the 1980's are dull affairs, made mostly of 0-1 yard runs. Its a lot of punts, and incomplete passes... they didn't know you should spread the field to create run lanes instead of making a pile 2 out of 3 downs with the 3rd being a pass to a slow blocker with a mustache that was bounced off his helmet because of the blitz.  Today a strategic revolution brings excitement to at least half of all games every Sunday. Parity is nice too. Yards per rushing Attempt are way higher, and Im a big fan of smash mouth running.",1451520000,,1482,4.604562737642586
