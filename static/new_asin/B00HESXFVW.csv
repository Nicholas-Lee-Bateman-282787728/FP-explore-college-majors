8632029,3,B00HESXFVW,"It's not that it's bad, but compared to previous years, Reel Rock 8 was rather lame. I still found it informational in some aspects though, like how commercialized and over-run Mt. Everest has become.  Spice Girl and The Sensei were probably the 2 better productions in my opinion. I'm not saying don't bother purchasing it (I still wanted my collection from Reel Rock to be complete), but I'm not upset anymore that I missed the showing when they were here in town.",1391212800,,466,4.682926829268292
