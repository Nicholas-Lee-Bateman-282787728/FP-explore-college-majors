2344909,5,B000A0GXGK,"This is a nice little collection of shows.  It is not the first season, nor does it have any extras. But, considering the price, it is a nice collection of a few shows.  It's not too few shows, but we all wish there could be more.  The quality is reasonably good, considering what the age the show was recorded from.

I hope many reviewers do not give this low points for what it is not.  Too often, people say things like, ""they should have released the whole series, so I am only giving it 3 stars.""  This was advertised as a few good shows and the price reflects that.  If you want to see a few more good episodes, buy this.  I am sure that if the studio does well on sales with this, they will release a more expansive (and more expensive) collection of laughs.",1128470400,8,765,4.191780821917808
2344910,5,B000A0GXGK,"Well who's job is it? To put an entire season of Chico and the Man on DVD? I love this show and enjoyed TV Land's very short run of the classic show a few years ago. When I found out it was coming out on DVD I was ecstatic. However it is NOT season 1. It is one disc with only six ""hand picked"" episodes of the entire series and they're not in any kind of order...

1. The Pilot
2. If I Were a Rich Man
3. Chico and the Van
4. Chico's Cousin Pepe
5. Chico's Padre
6. Ed Talks to God

There are no extras. Just a French, English, or Spanish subtitle option.
It still gets 5 stars (Loooking Goood!) because I love the show and you can't beat the price. So if you want a handful of of Chico and the Man eps for under $10? This is for you.

Now if jou don' mind I gotta wash my uncle's '64 Chevy with poms poms on the antenna, celophane seat covers, and a little dog in the back window with the head keeps going up and down!",1128038400,83,920,3.806282722513089

2344947,3,B000A0GXGK,"Let me tell you like it is. This is a one disc set of six episodes. While the episodes are funny enough, it is strange that Chico (Freddie Prinze, Sr.), never gets to utter his famous catch phrase from the series: ""Looking Good"". Why? I have no idea! I bought my copy a while back and paid just a couple of bucks, brand new and still in the shrink wrap. Amazon has drastically increased the price for this one single disc and it isn't worth it. Go to one of the auction sites or one of the other sites that sales DVD's and pay anywhere from $3.00 to whatever. Save yourself ten or eleven dollars (and yes, you can still find many copies brand new, still wrapped). Enjoy this DVD for what it is: the only release of any of the Chico and the Man material (in the United States and not bootlegged)!! For some inexplicable reason, after all of these years, only these six episodes have ever been released! I suggest if you eventually want to see every season of C.A.T.M. released, you need to write to the studio and tell them you want to see it released. The only other option is, Shout! Factory. They release hard to find T.V. shows, movies, concerts, and children's programming, that you can't find anywhere else. I hope this review helped you out.",1429920000,11,1247,4.402597402597403

2344994,5,B000A0GXGK,"This is a wonderful tv series that ran from 1974-1978.  I watched it
faithfully every week in its original run.  It really needs to be
out on dvd (preferably all in one large complete series collection).
It's family-friendly, clever, sweet, addictive, and smile-inducing !!

Come on studios, owners, and whoever else has it in their grasp to put
these timeless treasures out to us, the little people.  Most of the
people (nowadays) are disillusioned and disgusted with most of the
current tv program garbage that is being heaped on us by ""suits""
that could not give a Rat's (y.k.w.) about us.  I think that a lot of
kids and young people in this time period would like better shows on
television, too.  Retro-tv series on retro-tv channels are our only
other way to see consistent High Quality programming .

Come on, Suits !!!  Get the show on the Road !!!",1363478400,26,857,4.666666666666667
2344995,4,B000A0GXGK,"I remember watching this show as a kid and watching it again, ahem, many years later, brought back memories. Jack Albertson and Freddy Prinze are still fun to watch. It might just be me, but TV in that era was much more honest and straightforward about social issues, racism, and other issues than the overly politically-correct TV of today.

I only wish there were more episodes to watch.",1360195200,4,389,4.720588235294118
2344996,5,B000A0GXGK,"COME ON, WARNER BROTHERS! There are so many TV sitcoms that have every episode on DVD. Most of these supposedly ""funny"" shows pale in comparison to ""Chico and the Man"", which deserves -- no, demands the full-series DVD treatment, by its unique blend of comedy, heart, and the pure acting brilliance of its' two deceased superstars, Freddie Prinze, Sr. and Jack Albertson. This DVD set of six shows are each wonderfully funny, but when I'd watched all of them I felt much like a starving guy whose food is taken away after a very few bites. I want the whole series. Everyone who remembers the show fondly will buy it, too.
Unfamiliar with this show? It ran from 1974-78, and was an instant, big hit. (Search YouTube for it). Prinze, Sr., plays the wisecracking Puerto Rican whiz-kid auto mechanic, Chico Rodriguez. Albertson, whose career began in vaudeville, plays the grouchy owner of Ed Brown's Garage. Ed Brown is a hard-drinking widower, who laments the racial change of his East Los Angeles neighborhood from White to Hispanic at least as much, if not more than, the loss of his wife.
Brown's Garage isn't doing much business, because the few customers that come in Ed berates and insults, especially if they're Hispanic. [The character Ed Brown hurls every negative stereotype at such folks as this Whiter-than-White Irish guy has ever heard].
Enter Prinze's Chico Rodriguez, who needs a job. He not only pesters Ed for one 'til he gets it, but proves in short order that he's an even better mechanic than Brown, who slowly warms up to this youngster who's just bested him.
It's worth noting that when this show began, Prinze, Sr. was barely 20, and Albertson was 67. Yet the comic and actor's timing between them is as masterful as if they'd worked together for decades. The scripts crackle with life, and, as a bonus, each episode on this disc features one of my favorite humorists, Benjamin Sherman, AKA, ""Scatman"" Crothers, [1910-86], as Louie the garbage man. Crothers was an accomplished jazz musician and ""scat"" singer as well, known to have entertained feared Chicagoland gangster Al Capone. [With Al, you had to be good...or else]!
As many know, the show was doomed after Freddie Prinze, Sr.'s tragic drug-fueled suicide in 1977. Freddie was making the kind of money which gave him easy access to the two drugs-du-jour, cocaine and Quaaludes. Arrested for driving under the influence of the latter, his wife, Katherine Cochran, divorced him over fears that his increasing use of drugs was endangering their newborn son, Freddie Prinze, Jr. [Star of I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and its sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), and his first leading role, the romantic comedy She's All That (1999)].
Despondent over his divorce, Freddie Prinze, Sr. left a note stating his intentions, then took his own life at age 22 in January, 1977.
Warner Brothers could do Freddie Senior AND Junior no greater honor than to release the entire of ""Chico and The Man"" shows. SOMEONE who reads this review will know someone at Warner Brothers. Please, please, urge them to release this very heartwarming, very realistic, and genuinely funny series!",1358380800,27,3170,4.894052044609666

It's as good as I remember, and even better now that I'm old enough to get the jokes and habla muy poquito espanol (speak a little Spanish for the monolingual out there).

Prinze as Chico essentially (and subtly) points out the stupidity of prejudice to the boozing bigot Ed Brown, and the triumph of a positive attutude and the human spirit. In fact, as a child, most of the people around me hated Hispanics. As a ten year old watching this show, I figured they couldn't be that bad (says a lot about the influence of television on children).",1177286400,8,800,4.5874125874125875

2345055,5,B000A0GXGK,This DVD contains 6 episodes. Oh how I wish the entire show would be released on DVD. Freddie was the man. I loved this show as a kid and I still think is was one of the funniest shows of the 70s. RIP Freddie. You are missed. They should honor this great comedian by releasing this show ASAP! The chemistry between Freddie & Jack was so terrific. I am wanting more!,1170201600,3,365,4.154929577464789
2345056,4,B000A0GXGK,Chico and the man was one of the first shows I can remember seeing and it had been years since I had seen it so I decided to pick up a copy of this one disc set. It has several good shows including the pilot but because there are only has 6 shows it leaves you wanting more. There are no extras in this set however the print looks good and is a must for any Chico and the man fan.,1168473600,3,380,3.7037037037037037

The world's most popular ""hungarican"" (as he referred to himself since he was half hungarian, half puerto rican)still lives on through the magic of video. Now when will the box sets start to come out??? Long live Freddie!!",1165363200,3,393,4.549295774647887
2345059,5,B000A0GXGK,"I was very happy to be able to see Chico and the Man again.  I had a huge crush on Freddie Prinze when I was a kid, and these shows brought back a lot of memories.  The program itself holds up surprisingly well, particularly compared to other sitcoms of the time.  A rare opportunity to see a pioneer Latino stand-up comic whose work is not readily available!",1154736000,8,359,4.3283582089552235
2345060,5,B000A0GXGK,"You cant get any better than Chico and the Man, you cant get any better than Freddie Prinze! Its hard to believe that Freddie Prize would be 51 years old if he was alive, wow! So sad he has been gone for 30 years now, it feels like yesterday when I first saw him on tv. This dvd is great, but like the rest of you, we need the entire series!!! Seeing only a few episodes just makes you want to see them all!! I love you Freddie, you were a wonderful person inside and out, I love you!!",1151625600,4,485,3.909090909090909
2345061,5,B000A0GXGK,"This DVD is a great show that would have been remembered even more if Freddie Prinze didn't die and the show had gone for a few more seasons. This show was a hit, being featured on the cover of TV Guide Magazine 3 times.

In my opinion, the pilot episode is the best episode. The acting is great, the comedy is great, the writing is great, therefore it is a great show. Also a good episode is ""Chico's Cousin Pepe"", with one of the greatest musicians of all time, Jos? Feliciano, as the guest star. Although his acting is pretty bad, he performs a number of songs that are just good music. Also ""Chico's Padre"" starring Cesar Romero as Chico's father. My only complaint is that there are only 6 episodes, and if you search on a search-engine ""lol tv"" you'll find a website that has about 10 episodes of Chico And The Man that you can watch FOR FREE. 3 episodes at the website are on this DVD. But, if you want to pay the money to watch the show on a TV, get this DVD.",1145059200,20,967,4.171122994652406
2345062,5,B000A0GXGK,"ok i admit if Freddie was the first really HOT hispanic star, that would have made it to superstar status if only his life was not cut short.  Then chemistry between him and Jack Albertson was not only creative but realistically funny.  Of course with Jimmy Komack producing it is not  surprising. Just think of how far Freddie would have gone.  Excellent show one of my top ten of all time.",1139356800,2,391,4.464788732394366

2345064,5,B000A0GXGK,"How wonderful for Warner Bros. Entertainment to finally release six episodes of Chico and the Man (NBC, 1974-78) starring Jack Albertson and Freddie Prinze.
  I remember seeing the very first episode on September 13, 1974 when I was 11 years young.  The show was funny and when Prinze came on as ""Chico"", I didn't know what to think of him at first, but the man was funny. He had me laughing throughout the program until my stomach hurt.  It became my favorite show and I did not like to miss it.
  I also saw the Million Dollar Rip-off (NBC, 1976-tvm), starring Freddie Prinze.
  When the tragic announcement was made on the news that Freddie Prinze had shot himself and later passed away, January 29, 1977 at the age of 22, I had a real hard time believing it.  When you are young, you think that when a person goes to the hospital, they will be fine. However, Freddie Prinze left us.  I grew up that night.
  After reading the book, ""The Freddie Prinze Story"" by Maria Pruetzel and John A. Barbour, then I understood why Freddie left.  The stardom, the pressure, constant traveling, the drugs, he would get lonely, depressed and upset. He missed his newborn son. It was just hours after he had filmed the episode ""Ed Talks To God"".  That night at home with Quaaludes and a gun, he was upset and even though his friends and his manager tried to help him that night, Freddie wasn't in a good state of mind and had sleeplessness and was deeply depressed. The gun went off and Dusty found Freddie slumped over in the hallway.  Freddie went through periods of holding his gun not wanting to be without it.

  For many of us, we have not seen Freddie Prinze since his last appearance as ""Chico"" or his clips from ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"".
  This DVD release of ""Chico and the Man"" is a real treat and a keepsake.

  The first episode, the test pilot episode, aired, September 13, 1974 on NBC. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr.

  ""If I Were A Rich Man"", (Season One, episode 16) aired, January 31, 1975. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Scatman Crothers, Isaac Ruiz.

  ""Chico and the Van"" (Season 2, episode 6) aired October 17, 1975. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Scatman Crothers, Ralph Manza, Penny Marshall.

  ""Chico's Cousin Pepe"" (Season 2, episode 19) aired Feb. 11, 1976. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Jose Feliciano.  Mr. Feliciano is really blind. He is a singer, guitar player and does sing the theme song of this tv series.

  ""Chico's Padre"" (Season 3, episode 15) aired February 4, 1977. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Scatman Crothers, Cesar Romero, Jerry Hausner.
This episode was broadcast 6 days after Freddie Prinze died.

  ""Ed Talks To God"" (Season 3, episode 18) aired March 4, 1977. Jack Albertson, Freddie Prinze, Della Reese, Scatman Crothers, Edward Andrews, Carmen Zapata.
  This was the last episode Freddie Prinze taped. He shot himself later that night. This episode was broadcast 34 days after his death.

  In later episodes (not on this DVD), they immediately tried to keep the show going for Jack Albertson's sake. Danny Mora returned as ""Salvador"".

  In Season 4: They introduced 12 year old Gabriel Melgar as ""Raul"", who stays with Ed. They had two dramatic episodes (#13 & 14) with Ed trying to cope with Chico being gone and Raul running away to Mexico. Some scenes were filmed on location.
  Season 4 would be the last season. (Not on this DVD).

  Episodes in English language only. Option of subtitles: English, Spanish and French.

If after you finish an episode, you should happen to see the blue screen warning, just go back to main menu and select episodes again.

In-episode advertising: Coca-Cola, Woolworth, Thrifty, U.S. Army, Triple AAA Auto Club, Betty Crocker, Carnation Milk.

  I really wish NBC and Warner Bros. would get together and allow the release of ""Chico and the Man"" in a season set or complete tv series set.  Bring back the laughter again in your living room and enjoy Freddie Prinze.

2345065,5,B000A0GXGK,"I recently purchased the DVD of Chico & the man. I was as ecstatic and I think is just awsome for me to own this show on DVD I have been waiting a long time for this show to come on the market, although I wish they would sell all the episodes not just a few. This DVD really took me back on a nostalgic trip Freddie Prinze was great & wish he would still be around. He was on his way to the top rising up as one ( the only one) succesful Hispanic comedian of that decade. I want to watch those episode of him saying ""Looking Good!"" but none of these episode have him saying that frase. All in all this is a great buy you'll enjoy this DVD the color & the sound is great also all the other stars that come on the show are great like Jack Albertson and Della Reese, but specially if you're a Freddie Prinze fan you will enjoy owning this DVD.",1130889600,,840,3.91812865497076

Chico and the Man is a show i used to watch when i was a kid, i haven't even seen a single episode untill yesterday when i saw this at the store and snatched it up. I have to admit, every time it would start, and i heard Jose Feliciano start singing the theme song, tears would swell up. its so sad that Freddie Prinze was gone so young. and last episode is included in this collection...very sad.. but great to own!! i recommend this DVD to all. go out and buy it today! the more sales it gets, the sooner the production company gets all the seasons out on DVD!",1130025600,6,687,4.021897810218978
2345069,5,B000A0GXGK,"Chico and the Man is truly a timeless classic that should not be missed! Freddie Prinze and Jack Albertson are magnetic to watch. Comedies like this are not being made any more. I hope Warner Home Video will decide to release FULL SEASON sets, as this dvd was great, but only a sampling of how funny the show really was. Freddie's catchphrase of ""looking goood"" wasn't in any of these episodes, unfortunately, and it would have been nice to have a tribute to Freddie Prinze. During the run of the show, there were other semi-regular cast members, aside from Louie the Garbageman (Scatman Crothers) and Mando (Isaac Ruiz), including Mabel the Mail Carrier (Bonnie Boland), the Rev. Bemis (Ronny Graham) and Della Rogers (Della Reese). Plus there were several guest appearances on various shows such as, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Orlando, Jose Feliciano, Shelly Winters, Rich Little, Avery Schreiber, Jim Backus and Ceasar Romero. This show stands the test of time and is definetly one of the best! :-)",1129420800,9,996,4.899408284023669

2345071,5,B000A0GXGK,"The late comedian Freddie Prinze lives again in this collection of six episodes of the '70s NBC TV situation comedy ""Chico and the Man.""  The episodes in this DVD, selected as the show's finest or most noteworthy, are:

1. ""Pilot"" - episode 1, originally broadcast 9/13/74.

2. ""If I Were a Rich Man"" - episode 16, originally broadcast 1/31/75.

3. ""Chico and the Van"" - episode 28, originally broadcast 10/17/75.

4. ""Chico's Cousin Pepe"" - episode 41, originally broadcast 2/11/76.  (Pepe is played by Jose Feliciano, the composer and singer of the show's theme song.)

5. ""Chico's Padre"" - episode 59, originally broadcast 2/4/77.  (Cesar Romero guest stars as Chico's father.)

6. ""Ed Talks to God"" - episode 62, originally broadcast 3/4/77.  (This is the final episode in which Freddie Prinze appeared.)

That last episode is particularly noteworthy as it was videotaped on January 27, 1977, just one day before Freddie Prinze shot himself to death.

It is impossible to see Prinze ""alive"" again in these episodes without reminders of his fate.  In ""Pilot,"" for example, the Man (Jack Albertson) tells Chico (Prinze) to ""drop dead""--and Chico proceeds to do just that!

This DVD is an excellent sampler of ""Chico and the Man"" and is highly recommended as such.  For those who would like to explore Prinze's comedy further, the CD ""Looking Good"" on the Collectables label contains Prinze's stand-up routine, is available via Amazon.com and is also highly recommended.",1128816000,5,1471,5.070833333333334
2345072,5,B000A0GXGK,"My husband and I bought this ""sampler"" set (along with the other WB ""Television Favorites"":  ""Maverick"", ""Cheyenne"" and ""F Troop"").  Seeing Freddie Prinze at the zenith of his too-short career was a bittersweet experience.  Who knows what heights he would've reached had he lived?  Jack Albertson's ""Ed Brown"" was the perfect straight man to Prinze's ""Chico"", and the supporting cast (Scatman Carothers, Della Reese) played their roles to perfection.

Thank you, Warner Brothers.  Now, how about releasing boxed season sets?",1128729600,3,524,5.4875
