4049324,5,B0031O8266,"Here we see Darth Vader's daddy, The Lightning, the supervillain of supervillains. Armed with weapons that fire bolts of lightning, he is a one man crime wave battling U.S. Marines no less, led by the screen's first Lone Ranger, Lee Powell, himself a Marine in combat before long. Stubbornly resisting Powell's efforts to unmask him, The Lightning sets up a deadly retaliation using a gigantic flying wing (borrowed from the Dick Tracy serial) to terrorize the country. Didn't our Air Force come up with a ship just like it for use as a transport?",1356912000,5,547,4.829787234042553

8387102,5,B0031O8266,"I give 5 stars to this classic SERIAL.  Not experiencing the ""graininess"" another reviewer found. Quality is great. However, the packaging is where I have an issue.  For the higher price than normal (NON-DVD-R issued serials) I would have expected the DVD's to at least be in the case and not in an envelope inside the case, which by the way is of cheap quality.
Also the artwork on the back shows a credit listing for this and ""Manhunt in the African Jungle"" which at first glance would indicate that both serials are here, which of course they are not.
This may appear as minor things but I like a DVD whose artwork is of the item in my possession and not another unrelated DVD.
So Serial good, packaging not so much.",1467676800,2,719,4.4393939393939394
8387103,1,B0031O8266,"Fighting Devil Dogs has characters and cheezy special effects that make it one of the best.....But....
  1). This supposed DVD-R 2-Disc remastered version is questionable as the copy I received appears to have a VHS tracking bar at the bottom.
  2). The graininess of the picture is worse then the old VHS tape I bought from a now defunct video store that was a rental.
I have purchased several DVD-R serials and movies but I have not had this problem before. I am trying to return this copy but it may be a problem as it is a fulfillment through Amazon and there seems to be some resistance. Again, great Serial.",1456876800,,613,4.495495495495495

8387108,4,B0031O8266,"Non serial (chapter plays) fans don't understand the role they played in movie history when audience demand/attention/need was different from recent times/today. They and the rest of the B movie genre were not designed for Academy Award nominations. If you are interested in U.S. movie history ie:""Hollywood"" you owe it to yourself to do some research on the B movies.",1375488000,5,368,5.15
8387109,5,B0031O8266,"This serial could be about our own foreign policy. When the Lightning states confidently in Chapter 2 that he will dictate his will to ""the fools down below with their armies, battleships and guns"" declaring that he has the power to control the world with his electrical weaponry, doesn't that resemble our intoxication with power which influences our own foreign policy so dramatically? I saw this film again, after so many years, when the US invaded Kuwait in 1991. When I saw the buildings falling to aerial bombings in the beginning of Chapter 1, I immediately associated it with the first Persian Gulf War. And the Marines are fighting this attempt at world domination! It's quite a serial which I have seen many times. Herman Brix, later known as Bruce Bennet, was the co-star. Lee Powell, who later died in the Pacific Theatre as a Marine, had the leading role. He served in the Corps at the age of 36. In 2004, I could not fail to visit his gravesite at the Hawaiin Punch Bowl Cemetary. Viewers will definetely like this film which I strongly recommend.",1357603200,4,1061,4.709677419354839
