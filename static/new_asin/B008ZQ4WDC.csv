5198246,4,B008ZQ4WDC,"A good portrayal of human emotion in the reality of a Childrens hospital in Russia. Since Chernobyl I am sure this is more common place than an exception. I know of many Christian organizations from America that fly at their own expense to comfort children in Russian hospitals and encourage them with gifts, music and song. Not as an organization per se' but as a group with a common goal, to comfort the afflicted and bring joy to their lives, if only for a season. A few weeks at a time several times a year.
This movie showed a similar portrayal with a man not really interested at first, but quickly drawn to the simple needs of the children, to be children, creative with much joy and imagination. Worth watching with older children 6 -14 years of age.

5198251,5,B008ZQ4WDC,"This is an amazing film about some amazing people. The plot centers on cancer-stricken kids in a hospital in Russia who are running low on hope, until a man named Alex comes into their lives. Alex encourages the musical ability of the kids and a young boy, Misha, plays a violin for a girl in a coma. The supervisor of the hospital, Olga, is known as ""Stalin"" and makes the kids quit playing. However, both Nurse Elena and Alex suspect she has a soft heart below her tough exterior and while she is gone raising funds for the hospital, they get the kids involved in painting the walls and planning a concert in the auditorium below, as the hospital was once a Conservatory.

The kids face a few low moments including the loss of a friend, but they persevere and find hope in some unlikely places and with the help of some unlikely people. The movie features a touching scene of a dying girl ""marrying"" the young man she loves in an emotional ""wedding"" scene. She is his princess and he is her prince according to her. This inspirational film will stir and move you and we gladly award it our Dove ""Family-Approved"" Seal for ages twelve plus, due to a few sophisticated themes. This one is very worthy of the five Doves we are awarding the film.

8533059,2,B008ZQ4WDC,"It was a very sad movie.  All about children in a hospital that were terminally ill.  When I watched the trailer, it showed only the good parts of the movie which was pretty much at the end of the movie.

8533061,3,B008ZQ4WDC,"It's not a great movie, but not a bad movie either.  It was like watching a play.  The acting was terrible except for the male lead.  He was exceptional.  The acting was so bad we thought perhaps there is a story behind the movie, such as were these really sick children and not actors?  The female leads were trying but were terrible.  A distraction.  Hard to follow the story unless you read the jacket cover description.  Would not recommend.",1393545600,,445,4.544303797468355
