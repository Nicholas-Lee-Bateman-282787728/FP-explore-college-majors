8336218,5,B001QTAJNW,This is a great video. Alan shows you how to make mink and muskrat sets and explains how the sets work and how the animals work them. Lots of information along with catches in the sets he makes. Great for a beginning trapper to watch and learn. I would highly recommend any video Alan Probst makes. He is a first class knowledgeable outdoorsman who has spent his entire life in the outdoors. He knows what he is talking about.,1357430400,,426,4.405063291139241
