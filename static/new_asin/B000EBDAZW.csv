8108076,1,B000EBDAZW,Seriously? Who in their right mind is going to pay over $200 for this or any single DVD? It's unbelievable what people are thinking.,1365120000,,132,4.541666666666667
8108077,5,B000EBDAZW,It was videos from her old songs such as heartbreaker. I love it. Nice quality.  Worth buying under 20 dallors.,1206921600,,111,4.55
8108078,3,B000EBDAZW,"This is a pretty good collection of some of Mariah Carey's officially unreleased film clips. These include ""When you Believe"", ""My All (Stay A While""), ""Whenever you Call"" and ""All I Want for Christmas is You"". Some of the film clips are slightly damaged, however, the person who had originally taped these film clips from TV has done their best to maitain the quality of the film clips.

This is a MUST for any huge Mariah Carey fan! I know I enjoyed it!",1183852800,,455,4.481927710843373
8108079,3,B000EBDAZW,"well, it was okay. the video's weren't quite clear but i have to say that it is a good collection to have of mariah's video's. the disc was messing up in some parts and the view wasn't clear...the views was also unstable. i love her videos though. i was kinda dissappointed not because of the videos but the way it was made. it is boot-leg (fake production) unauthorized!",1183248000,3,371,4.470588235294118
8108080,2,B000EBDAZW,"I give this disk 2 stars because there appears to be some previously unreleased material here.

From what I can gather on the web this appears to be partially a rehash of previously released videos. Fans will probably never be rewarded with the complete unabridged catalogue of Mariah's videos in any coherant package.

Here is a track list for this disk:

Honey

Heartbreaker

My All

Whenever You Call

One Sweet Day

I Miss You

All I Want For Christmas Is You

Your Imagination

Heartbreaker

When You Believe

Sweetheart",1178928000,4,525,4.829545454545454
