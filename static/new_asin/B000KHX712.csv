8156923,4,B000KHX712,"I always think of Disneys delightful Robin Hood as a leftover of The Jungle Book and Bedknobs and Broomsticks animated animal characters thrown into Sherwood Forest. Robin Hood, a furry fox, is less than imposing as a do-gooder who must use his wits to overcome and be a pain in the thumb of the dull Prince John (voiced inimitably by the wonderful Peter Ustinov). Thumb sucker Prince John (a lion) and his berated #2, Sir Hiss (a snake who has far more smarts than John but also far less security), steal the show as they are villains you love to love as they are so bad and inept at being bad. Voice casting is excellent and is what really elevates the film as the animation showed all of the shortcuts and quickness of an industry that was trying to crank out this fare. It still works but it lacks the crispness and magic of previous efforts.",1506470400,,846,4.42948717948718
8156924,3,B000KHX712,"I bought this DVD because Amazon.com attended it me after having orderedt the original Disney film. That one is great. This one is jolly, a fun to watch but cannot stand in the shadow of the original. The telling is more of the same, although the scene at the bowshootingcontest is very short. That goes for the whole movie, it is a mere 48 minutes. I like the voices the most, some have a German or French accent when played in that country. The characters have less depth than in the Disney movie. This is more 3d-animation than the earlier version. The story is also more compact, with a new twist, the boattrip amidst bad wheather. The crowning of Robin Hood as a knight at the end is also a new invention.",1174089600,2,710,4.386363636363637
