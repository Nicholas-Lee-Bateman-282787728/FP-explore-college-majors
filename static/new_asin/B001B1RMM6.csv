8281375,5,B001B1RMM6,"Great teaching method for beginners using Isis Wings. I would highly recommend this video before using your wings. People make mistakes thinking they don't need some type of teaching when using new products. I am a dance teacher and I'm always looking to learn new techniques in dance. Thank you Phoenix. The only regret I have is that it is very hard to order the wings, because the demand is so great, no one keeps enough inventory.",1266105600,3,434,4.64935064935065
