8229421,5,B000XRLDY2,Vol. 4 Grandes peleas Has the best fight in year 2000 in my opinion(Ring magazine says Barrera vs morales but i like this one more.)Felix Trinidad vs Fernando Vargas. A great battle of left hooks in this one. Commentary is in english. The next fight pits Wilfredo Gomez against Lupe Pintor with no commentary. Great fight anyways. Could have been fight of the year in 1982 but had to compete with Chacon v.s. Limon.,1347408000,,415,4.621621621621622
8229422,5,B000XRLDY2,"Lots of speculating going into fight night, December 2, 2000. Felix ""Tito"" Trinidad was the more proven commodity, having garnered an impressive record of 38 wins, no losses, and 31 KOs. Fernando ""El Feroz"" Vargas was the hot up-and-comer, the youngest champion in the junior middleweight division's history, and the kid from Oxnard, CA had just passed a grueling test from the very tough Winky Wright. Vargas's record at the time was also unblemished: 20-0 with 18 KOs. Both were sensational punchers and both were on some kind of a roll. Trinidad was 27 years old, Vargas a mere 22. Before the fight Tito dismissed El Feroz as a mere baby. Certainly a vicious spanking was administered. Except that both fighters took turns being on the receiving end.

Trinidad had a bad habit of being wobbled early, but on this night Vargas was the one instantly placed in jeopardy on the strength of two vicious left hook knockdowns by Tito. Vargas showed enough poise that he survived the devastating first round, and the ensuing ebbs and flows would entertain the crowd well into the twelfth stanza, with Vargas's grit for a while matching Trinidad's relentlessness. Vargas would get his own shots in but, of the two, Vargas was shook up the worst and would get continuously shook up. It didn't help that when Vargas was finally teeing off and had rocked Trinidad, the Puerto Rican resorted to purposeful and debilitating low blows. I lost a bit of respect for Trinidad that night. Vargas showed his stones, even as Trinidad was crushing them. In round 8, Vargas finally retaliated with his own arsenal of low blows. Referee Jay Nady would end up taking points away from both fighters.

GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 4 recounts the entire fight and includes Vargas and Trinidad's ring entrances (Vargas's was showmanship material and lengthy). Also intact are the one minute rest breaks in the corner between the rounds. The HBO team of Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and George Foreman provides the fight commentary to this stirring Junior Middleweight championship fight. The final word on this bout is this: Felix Trinidad took something out of his opponent that night, something which the proud and prideful Fernando Vargas, known as El Feroz and the Aztec Warrior, would never ever recover. But at least he's got his Nawshis clothing line to fall back on.

The second fight featured here is the December 3, 1982 war between Wilfredo ""Bazooka"" Gomez and Lupe Pintor as they contended for the WBC Super-Bantamweight championship of the world. One of the most revered boxers in Puerto Rico, Gomez's only loss at this stage was to Salvador Sanchez and each of the Bazooka's then 37 wins had come by knockout. Pintor was a rugged Mexican challenger, but I wasn't sure that Gomez had a clue that he'd end up engaging in one of the toughest fights of his career. Pintor flashed a record of 49-5-1 with 38 KOs and was definitely up to the challenge. This was a highly contested, very heated slugfest, with Pintor giving as good as he got and sometimes giving better than what he got.

Round 12 was a particularly telling one. In that stanza Gomez had steadily pummeled Pintor but with seconds left had punched himself out. Pintor returned fire and had Gomez seriously hurt. If the bell hadn't rung just then, who knows but that Pintor wouldn't have knocked Bazooka out. Gomez was so out of sorts that one of his corner men had to bodily lift and carry him to his corner. Pintor and Gomez went toe to toe, trading hurtful shots, until the 14th round when one of them finally had his will broken and succumbed to attrition. A great prize fight culminating in a crunching TKO stoppage.

No commentary provided for Gomez vs. Pintor on this DVD, but the pick-up microphones must've been placed in primo spots because you can clearly hear the corners encouraging their respective fighters in Spanish, legendary referee Arthur Mercante's instructions (""Keep 'em up, Gomez!"" ""Keep them up, Lupe!"") and, even more tellingly, all the crisp punches landing with thuddish conviction.",1263600000,,4047,4.867924528301887
