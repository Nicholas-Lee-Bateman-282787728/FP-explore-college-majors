Maybe there will be a miracle, and the show will be brought back to life due to huge DVD sales ( al la Family Guy).  Andy and teh rest of the cast and creators - because this is one of your babies so you are probably reading these reviews - you have made my life better. It is time we hang out.

3747659,5,B001PKHS6I,"It's hard to describe Andy Richter Controls the Universe.  It seems as if several shows that have sprung up on television in recent years have ""borrowed"" mightily from Universe.  Scrubs, Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Rock...I think all these shows owe a debt to Universe.

Andy Richter is the most average fellow on the outside, but what goes on in his head is so bizarre and hilarious that words cannot do justice to this gem of a show.  Fox did its usual job of switching the show to several different nights, never allowing an audience to develop.  For the few of us that did watch the show, it was a delight and a treat.",1234396800,28,654,4.555555555555555

3747707,4,B001PKHS6I,"A very funny show - though not quite as funny as Andy Barker, P.I. This show takes place mainly at the workplace of all of its characters. Andy is a technical writer who really wants to be what he considers a ""legitimate"" writer. He has a very colorful and active imagination which provides some of the funnier portions of the show. He works with his closest friends and often interferes where he shouldn't. He has an inner voice in the form of the 150 year old man who started the company he works for, another one of the funnier aspects of this show. It's too bad it was only given one season. With more of a chance to develop its stories and characters, this show could have gone far.",1411948800,,687,4.333333333333333
3747708,5,B001PKHS6I,"""ARCTU"" is one of the funniest shows ever.  Well, it starts out brilliant, with frustrated writer Andy replaying episodes of his life for different resolutions, though he always comes back to reality.  If you appreciate its skewed humor it will truly have you howling with laughter.

A few caveats.  First, it has no laugh track or, worse, raucous live audience to cue you when to laugh.  Truly, the show doesn't need it, but it may confuse some people who may not be ready for finding places to laugh on their own.  Second, ""ARCTU"" bows from the waist to that most idiotic modern addition to the television comedy, the moral.  In the show Andy has to learn something and he, as narrator, has to spout some Aesopean balderdash at the end, as if the comedy has to be justified.

Watch out.  While the show purports to be about broadening your mind to different alternatives, it's really about what to think rather than how.  For instance, in one episode the company has to hire a minority and none of the principle cast points out the irony that this approach is itself racist.  Instead, they all rush out to headhunt the most minor minority possible,  So all the lessons we are carefully taught and the way ""ARCTU"" cultivated our minds to think are liberal first and last without question.  Still, despite that glaring hypocrisy, the show is hilarious.  Watch it at your own risk.",1410652800,,1380,4.672199170124482

3747746,4,B001PKHS6I,"Cute, clever, often very funny office set sit-com, where Andy Richter plays a Walter Mitty figure, who often spices up the life he shows us with brief fantasies.

While that sounds like a familiar set up, the writing and acting is very good, and the nice irony is that Andy's on screen 'real life' is pretty damn quirky, bizarre and interesting to start with.

Beyond that, the show isn't afraid of absurdity, and makes no effort to be 'real' - a style that was somewhat ahead of it's time. It also doesn't shy away from dark or politically incorrect comedy that edges into pretty sharp social satire.

Some episodes are much better than others, but none are bad, and the best are flat out terrific. It's also the rare sit com that actually grew on me on a second viewing.

One episode, where Conan O'Brien makes an appearance as the literally insane owner of the company is a classic. That episode truly rises to `Arrested Development' like levels of lunacy.",1307059200,,959,4.623529411764705

There are some extras in the DVD set including never before seen episodes, and individual commentaries that take you behind the scenes and personal with the cast. The DVD'S are brilliantly mastered and the video quality is really stunning I have to say. The show itself was unique and had a special type of humor and I was devastated and angry when it got cancelled. Not sure why this happened, the execs that did it are nuts as this show was one of the best shows I ever watched and many people I know also felt this way.",1270598400,,584,4.131578947368421
3747750,5,B001PKHS6I,"The show, like this review, had a short lifespan.  Andy and his supporting cast were all terrific and the writing was hilarious.  The flashbacks, the fantasies, and the hallucinations turned the show into a bizarre, jaunty delight.  As with too many quality programs to air on FOX, it got juggled and shuffled into oblivion.

ARCtU had been my favorite show for quite a while, I even paid $60 for a bootleg a couple of years ago. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves odd/bizarre comedy shows (like Arrested Development), it has a great cast and brilliant writing. I will re-buy this show again if they release it on Blu-ray since there are HD versions of the episodes (hopefully with some additional content).",1254441600,,528,4.343434343434343
3747753,5,B001PKHS6I,"If you want people to like you, wear a puppy suit:  meaning either a costume which makes you look like a puppy or one which contains many pockets in which you can put your pupppies.

These and other gems are contained on this DVD which features all the episodes from short lived FOX show (why they cancelled it but left some of their other programming going I'll never know).

For those who haven't seen this show, it features the day to day activities and day dreams of Andy Richter, a technical writer at some defense contracting firm.  (Interestingly enough the establishing shots for his office say ""Duke and Duke"" and were actually borrowed from the Eddie Murphy movie Trading Places.)

Owing to his low standing in the firm, Andy is early on saddled with a zany office mate/illustrator and along with other friends from their office they spend more time on silliness than any serious defense contracting.  In fact, in one episode, they actually make it so that a missile guidance system malfunctions.

Just as unlucky in love as he's unproductive at work, viewers are also treated to the many misadventures of Andy's love life including an episode where he starts dating an anti semite and wrestles with the question of just how prejudice he's willing to tolerate in a romantic partner.  Hint:  according to the show, you can allow more prejudice in your partner if you counter balance it with good deeds towards the community against whom your partner is prejudiced.

And speaking of prejudices there's an especially funny episode which guest stars Jon Cryer as a boss from Hell.  Andy and Co decide to make his life miserable by putting cow dung on his desk when Andy learns that Cryer actually suffers from an incurable disease.  By dint of lucky plot timing Andy says the immortal line:  ""Oh we did not know that you didn't like cow dung on your desk.""

This is a seriously funny show and just like when I first watched it I lauged out loud during the episodes.

Take it from me:  Andy Richter rules!",1250812800,,2010,4.683760683760684
3747754,5,B001PKHS6I,"I discovered this show about 2 weeks before it got canceled.  It's no mystery why --- it's one of those tv shows that you actually have to pay attention to, and apparently that's asking too much of an audience.  But thank god for DVD, because hidden treasures like this get to find the audience that they deserve.  This show is brilliantly written, and it's never safe.  The characters are lovable, but they can be selfish and mean, just like real people.  And the jokes take aim at everybody  - racists, and the supposedly liberal-minded people who are just as patronizing of the people they're ""protecting,"" for example.  This show was fearless - I wish more were like it.",1248048000,,674,4.661016949152542
3747775,4,B001PKHS6I,"The best news recently for the over-crowded late-night talk show world is that Andy Richter is rejoining Conan O'Brien when Conan takes over The Tonight Show this summer. Both have done well on their own but their chemistry together is undeniable. Conan, of course, chugged along in late night. Richter has appeared in many films and sitcoms, but his best work was on two shows he starred in: Andy Barker PI (which he says will be coming out on DVD shortly) and Andy Richter Controls The Universe: The Complete Series ($39.98; Paramount). This workplace comedy had a great cast (including Jonathan Slavin as a nebbishy buddy and James Patrick Stuart as a Ken doll-handsome guy for whom everything came easy), a playful sensibility (episodes about Andy dating a racist girl who was hot, etc) and fantasy sequences that were genuinely clever and fun. This set contains all 19 shows -- including the last five episodes, which never aired. They prove the show was just really hitting its stride. Very cult-worthy.",1245369600,,1009,4.9411764705882355

3747777,5,B001PKHS6I,"So I've been awaiting these DVDs forever, ever since the show was cancelled, and I've had them for a little over a month now. I had my pre-order in since the day it was available, and for the most part I could not be happier. The show still holds up today, despite all the great shows that have popped us since then, it still holds its own. The main actors play their characters amazingly well with all of their quirks and intricacies. A very funny, extremely well written, and tragically short-lived piece of comedy genius.

But enough about the show, by now you either know if you will like it or not I hope, what I really wanted to talk about is the DVDs. Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad these are out and I don't have to keep watching my downloaded copies on my computer screen, but I do have a couple gripes.

First off, the picture is cropped down from the original. Like Pan & Scan in reverse. Instead of cutting down a widescreen image to fit an old-style squarish TV screen, they cut down the original squarish picture of the TV show to fit today's widescreen TVs. So the bottom part of the original image and sometimes the top are chopped off. Not a huge problem, because obviously it was done in a way where you can still see what's going on all the time, but a bit annoying having about a third of the picture missing.

Secondly, (something that ""N. Smith"" touched on a little) is that some of the original music from the series was changed. Instrumental snippets of songs like ""Teenage Riot"" by the Ataris and ""Cyclone"" by the Dub Pistols were used to great effect in some episodes but now they've been replaced by generic pieces of music that convey vaguely the same feeling. Most people won't miss them, but it's just something I noticed while watching. The music that was specifically written for the show is great on its own, the other songs just added to that.

So there you go, a couple things that I didn't like, but which by no means drop this to less than a must-buy for me. 5 Stars, no doubt.

""Wow, we're really making a killing. Can't wait to go home, put on seven aprons and a couple of wigs and enjoy a highball out of a chipped State Bird glass.""",1241222400,8,2175,4.347290640394089

(2002)
-----------------------------------------------------
Looking back on Andy Richter's ill-fated network TV show, seven years after its ignoble cancellation, it's amazing how well it stands up and how funny it still is. One of the best workplace comedies ever aired, ""Andy Richter Controls The Universe"" has a great cast, with Paget Brewster as Andy's hard-bitten but sympathetic boss and Jonathan Slavin who is absolutely brilliant as his ultra-neurotic co-worker Byron. Richter is, of course, great as the not-too-nerdy, not-too-brainy star of the show, a lonely, insecure tech writer at a giant company who is constantly replaying the events of his life with constant ""what-if-I-could-rewind-that-scene"" replay fantasies that are the core of the show's humor.  The characters and their relationships to each other steadily grow as the show goes on, and ARCTU, despite its untimely demise, ultimately emerged as a fairly complete, whole package. One of the more notable victims of shortsighted network programming decisions -- right up there with ""Firefly,"" ""My So-Called Life"", ""Freaks & Geeks"" and Joan Cusack's ""What About Joan?"" -- the Andy Richter show is still timely and entertaining. If you missed it the first time around, take this opportunity to enjoy it now.  You'll have a blast! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1236816000,2,1376,5.5476190476190474
3747808,5,B001PKHS6I,"<sigh> Fox, when will you ever learn?
Starting in 1999, they mis-handled the brilliant Family Guy, prematurely canceling it. Someone there got the inspired idea to release it on DVD, it was a huge hit, so much so that they brought the show back, and as of this writing it is still thriving on Sundays.
I believe they've done it again with this Andy Richter show.
Other reviews have nicely captured what's special about this show, so I'll just say that there are a handful of shows that just *have it* (e.g. Seinfeld, NewsRadio, Simpsons, Family Guy); This show is one of them.

3747811,5,B001PKHS6I,"I was one of the few, fortunate ones who caught this show on it's very first episode, and immediately loved it.  I still have the old VHS I recorded every episode on.  I was starting to think this show would never make it to DVD.

Andy Richter Controls the Universe is one of those gems who's life was cut short.  In short, it was TOO good for TV.  With so many cookie-cutter sitcoms littering the airwaves, truely outstanding writing like this was underapreciated by audiences that only laugh when prompted by a laugh track.

This is the show that really set the ground work for shows to come both in it's style, wit, and gag-type humor.

Andy Richter returned years later with Andy Barker: PI.  If you saw that show, and not this one, they are night and day difference.  PI just wasn't funny, but 'Universe' brought a comedic brilliance I fear we will not see again.

Andy also showed up on another amazing show, Arrested Development, one of my favorites.  If any show can be put on equal ground with AD, it's this one.

The show is unique, extremely well-written, and incredibly fun, and features a perfect cast.  Buy this show, it will be worth every penny and more.",1235001600,2,1170,4.514285714285714
3747812,5,B001PKHS6I,I'm thrilled that Andy Richter Controls the Universe is FINALLY coming out on DVD!  There are so many classic one-liners and absurd jokes in this show!  My friends and I still talk about them!,1235001600,2,192,4.617647058823529
3747813,5,B001PKHS6I,"When this show was canceled I was, to put it simply, heartbroken. FOX had horribly mangled the show's timeslot, switching between Wednesday, Thursday, and eventually Tuesday. Often my friends and I couldn't even remember what day to find it on. The fact that it developed the following it did despite this confusion is a testament to the incredible show that it is. After it became evident that FOX wouldn't be bringing the show back, I sent emails to the network literally begging them to put it out on DVD. However, all I ever heard back in responses was that it ""wasn't likely"".

Now, after six long years of waiting, I received an email yesterday from Amazon letting me know that the DVD would be coming out.

What a wonderful surprise, I can't wait to watch it all again!

*Note for those who haven't seen the series, the episode guest starring Conan O'Brien is the funniest half-hour of television I've ever watched. You owe it to yourself to get this DVD.",1235001600,2,962,4.647058823529412

After you've watched you're going to think of several friends who would absolutely love it who have also never heard of it. Rather than risk losing your copy when they start passing it around, might as well order more than one. They make great gifts!

Seriously, if you love any of these and haven't seen any of the others, you'll probably love them, too. All great series. All more than a little bit warped. All cancelled before their time.

8333509,5,B001PKHS6I,"Richter has always been funnier than Conan, and this series - well written and smartly cast - really gave Richter a chance to show us his very funny everyman humorous persona. Reminds me a lot of Jim Gaffigan, who has a similar style and presence. This series slipped by under the radar, but it's an excellent DVD pickup now.",1522800000,2,325,4.52542372881356

8333511,5,B001PKHS6I,"This show (""ARCTU"") is clever, fun, and hilarious. I view it as a precursor to Arrested Development. Unfortunately, ARCTU got caught up in Fox TV's (mis)management as so many other quality shows did around this time. The network continually changed airing nights and never allowed the audience to find this gem of a show. It's also possible the show was a little ahead of its time (or a combination of both). Regardless, if you want a fun, clever comedy, don't miss this one (and keep an eye out for Conan O'Brien).",1514937600,,515,4.670329670329671
8333512,4,B001PKHS6I,"I never saw this show when it originally aired, so the whole series is new to me. Honestly, had I viewed it then, I would have given it 5 stars because the structure of the show is so different than mainstream sitcoms (with their stale story lines/laugh tracks). However, since I've previously discovered many other quirky shows before finding this one, it's not quite as exciting. Who knows? Maybe they were one of the first to break the mold. Either way, it's a fun & entertaining show for those of us who hate the typical crap on broadcast TV these days. And I enjoy Andy Richter. If you like Victor Fresco's other show, Better Off Ted, you'll probably like this one too. Too bad his most recent one, Santa Clarita Diet, is about eating people. I'm grossed out by the promo, so I haven't even given it a try yet.",1498953600,,815,4.44

8333515,1,B001PKHS6I,"Is the show good? I love it. Is this release of the show good? I hate it.

It doesn't include original music which leaves out some of the humor, e.g. ""Van McCoy - Do The Hustle"" playing while a deceased fellow gets out of his coffin and encourages Andy to go for it. This scene was designed and shot with this song in mind, but the song was replaced on this DVD with another song. It just looks weird.
What can be worse than that? This show was made right around the time when HDTV was coming around, so it was re-sized from its original 4:3 format by taking the top and bottom off the screen, or zooming in to the picture, taking off part of the picture. Imagine having a fun, entertaining, conversation, then holding up your hands so you can no longer see the forehead or part of the chin of the person you're talking with. This is weird, and may also be why the picture quality is complained about in other reviews; it's zoomed in on to ""fit"" an HDTV.

This was a great show, but I highly recommend not purchasing such a disheveled, malformed copy.",1461456000,2,1051,4.276381909547739
