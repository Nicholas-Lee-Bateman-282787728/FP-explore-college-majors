8219136,3,B000VKLXQ4,"I love Shelly and I thought the 2 pack DVD is going to be a great value. It is not. The New You DVD disc is ok but the Workout on the go is really disappointing. On the back it says the following workouts: KickBoxing, Hi-Lo Aerobics, Athletic Conditioning, Core Training, Athletic Conditioning BUT on the DVD you'll find: Hi-LO Aerobics, Core Training, Yoga, Low Impact, Chi Ball.
I am giving 3 as the workouts are good only not the ones I wanted to have.",1209945600,4,455,4.364705882352941
