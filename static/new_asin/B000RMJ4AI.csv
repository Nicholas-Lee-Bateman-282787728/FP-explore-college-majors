8201456,5,B000RMJ4AI,"i have waited along time to see 1 of my favourite bands of all time to come back. When i found out in early 2007 that onslaught were back i was hoping the album would be as good as the force. to my surprise killing peace has excelled the force into a better more rounded album. Live Polish Assault the dvd is a killer of a dvd. Great to see the boys live on a stage as its not easy for me to see them these days. the dvd itself has the polish live show, some japanese live footage and my personal favourite some live audio from bristol colston hall. I saw onslaught back in the 80's in bristol many times and they were always thankfull to there fans. Well heres 1 fan who n o longer lives england but lives in usa thanking onslaught for bringing out such a quality live dvd and hears looking at the future.",1209600000,,806,4.0754716981132075
