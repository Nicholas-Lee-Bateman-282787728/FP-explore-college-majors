5078889,5,B007CYKHIW,"Easily the best opera I've seen in high definition.  Everything about it is special.  Joyce DiDonato is perfect in the title role, and just wait till you see Eva Podles as her dreadful stepmother!  Ms. Podles practically steals the show.  Staging and sets are wonderful.  An all-around treat, and surely appropriate for young opera devotees as well.",1354060800,8,349,5.052631578947368

5078891,5,B007CYKHIW,"Massenet composed his opera about Cenerentola nearly 80 years after Rossini did his. And if you are looking for the outburst of the non-stop hilarity and the musical jokes of Rossini, you won't find it here. Also, while the Cendrillon was highly successful and popular in its time, it does not reach up to the artistic and musical levels offered by Massenet's other operas, like Manon, or Thais or Werther.

Nevertheless, this is a delightful opera and it is well presented by The Royal Opera. Laurent Pelly created a ingenious setting with movable walls which are covered [in French] with the story of Cinderella, and which open and close book-like. The opera's story line is much closer too the original [written by C. Perrault] than that of the Rossini: here Cenerentola has a henpecked father who married a devilish old countess with two daughters. The costumes are lavish [designed by Mr. Pelly], and the action is well directed. Most of the singers are excellent, especially my favorites, Joyce DiDonato and Alice Coote, [Cendrillon and the Prince Charmante] with their many love duetts. The coloratura soprano Fairy Mother [Eglise Gutierrez] has a beautiful voice and I will be looking for her on other DVD-s. Ewa Podles, the experienced Polish mezzo, brings most of the humor to the stage with her two ""daughters"". Jean-Philippe Lafont, the father, has relatively simple music to sing, but unfortunately he has difficulties finding the right starting note when the orchestra does not give it to him ahead [which is very often, since this is how Massenet wrote the music] and then he sounds ""bleating"". The dances are entertaining and well choreographed and the overall visual impression is very good. Bertrand Billy is an excellent conductor and he keeps the production going at a good clip.

In summary, this DVD will give you plenty of pleasure, especially if you watch it a couple of times.",1343174400,27,1901,4.9748427672955975
5078892,5,B007CYKHIW,"This is a great DVD.  The music is endlessly charming, DiDonato is superb--as is the whole cast (makes me want to see more of Podles, too).  The choreography had me laughing out loud.",1342137600,5,183,4.515151515151516
5078893,5,B007CYKHIW,"One of my most prized opera recordings is a mid-70s CBS set of CENDRILLON with the title role sung to absolute perfection by Frederica von Stade, who embodied everything the role Cinderella requires. Von Stade's signature virtue of charm makes her an ideal Lucette and vocally the role matched very distinctive voice with its beautiful colors, wide range, and elegant French diction. Ruth Welting was another reason for its success. Her La Fee was pure spun honey and she sat on its extreme top range with confidence and musical panache.  The rest of the cast, with one glaring exception was ideal.  But someone made the fatal mistake of casting a tenor in the role of of the Prince. Gedda sings it as well as can be expected, but it's all wrong. It's a trouser role for a mezzo and his tenor sounds completely out of sorts in this substitution.

More than thirty years later comes this delightful DVD from a Laurent Pelly production at Covent Garden, and it rightfully restores the Prince to the mezzo soprano, and what a mezzo she is. Alice Coote is a perfect prince, besotted by his Cendrillon and singing with power and finesse. The wonderful duets Massenet assigned to the lovers are simply gorgeous here. The supporting cast is excellent with Eglisse Gutierrez a wonderfully worldly La Fee and singing with superb control, the fearsomely funny Eva Podles as the imperious and pompous step mother.  My only caveat is Jean-Philippe Lafont's wobbly, unfocused singing, which undermined the tenderness in his one big scene with Cendrillon.

At the center of this confection is Joyce di Donato. I never thought anyone could match von Stade in the part. Ms. DiDonato's is fully her equal with softly lofted pianissimi, a rich tonal pallette, and equally elegant French. Her lower range is a bit more earthy than von Stade's --not a complaint--a compliment in the best sense. Bertrand de Billy's supple conducting is the icing on the cake.

This is superb compliment to the CBS recording and no serious collector should be without both!",1341014400,38,2035,4.884057971014493
5078894,5,B007CYKHIW,"Jules Massenet's Cendrillon is not an opera I would have imagined being available in a DVD format. The Met has never staged it and performances have been few. Part of the problem is that Massenet has been out of favor both with critics and the opera going public. Manon and Werther have been revived with some frequency. Thais is revived when you have a diva that has enought cachet to request it and enough box office pull to warrant its revival. Cendrillon has been recorded by Columbia/Sony with von Stade who championed the work and was able to get it mounted for her. To date this is the only recording. Alas it was compromised when the powers that be cast Nicolai Gedda as Prince Charming when the role was written for a mezzo-soprano. Perhaps they thought that the opera would prove more acceptable to a public who really didn't know it. Since it was ""late: Gedda the results were poor and the effects that Massenet had achieved in the scenes between Lucette and Prince Charminig were destroyed. ROH, however, got it right as regards casting. In fact they have made the strongest possible argument for more frequent revivals. Cendrillon, though, is not of study construction as is Boheme which has survived any number of indifferent performances and survived. Cast it from strength, mount it with style and conduct and sing it with love and you have an audience. Otherwise, don't bother.

It is easy to critize Massenet and other French composer of the mid nineteenth century such as Delibes, Thomas and Gounod. They were guilty of assaulting great works of literature, emasculating them and wonder of wonders they were successful--for a time. (I am excluding Berlioz, Bizet and Debussey from this group for obvious reasons.) Massenet was perhaps the most successful of the group. He was prolific and wrote in many styles and genres. He chose never to  repeat a genre. What he and his colleagues were able to do was write lovingly for the voice and singers responded by singing their music. When He died in 1912 he had been oblivious to the winds of change and while he couldn't ignore Wagner, the influence was essentially superficial. What he wasn't oblivious to were the charms of many of the prima donnas who sang the roles of Manon, Esclarmond, Herodiade. He was also guilty of tailoring a role to a specific singer. This was not ""high art"" as the German, say, conceived it. It was entertainment. The twentieth century repaid Massenet by ignoring him.

Luckily these criticisms are of little consequence today and if you are not immune to charm and delicacy an opera such as Cendrillon can be immensely satisfying--at least I found it so. And it could hardly be otherwise with Joyce DiDonao who sings ravishingly. Her Prince Charming is the English mezzo Alice Coote whose voice is darker and probably large than DiDonato's. Their duets are sublime. The decision to cast Eva Podles as the stepmother was brilliant. This artist has too long been underexposed and any reason to cast her should be acted on. Jean-Phillipe LaFont as Pandolfe is the only native Frencbh speaker, but he has a wobble that is wearisom--my only criticism but certainly not a deal breaker. The Fairy Godmother--here known as La Fee--is sung by Eglise Gutierrez; her French is perhaps the poorest, but she has the top notes and is enchanting.

What I find most troubling about this release and newer DVDs is the  failure to provide the cue points in the  accompanying notes. Initially we got not only the cue points but the artists involved. Virgin was never one for providing extensive notes and now they are modeling their packaging after Kultur--a poor role model. I am old enough that I remember when I bought complete operas in the days of 78's. There were no notes. LP's of course changed all that. I wonder why the companies think they are absolved from providing any data--or at least data that would help the listening experience. At Least Kultur does (or did) provide the cue points.",1339459200,58,3978,4.808479532163743
5078895,5,B007CYKHIW,When we saw the film of this production at the Morgan library we searched for the DVD only to find it had not been released yet. This is a very beautifully sung  Cendrillon. There is not a weak member of the cast The production is whimsical. The trying on of the slipper by the ladies in red is wonderful. Can't wait to buy this.,1334620800,12,329,4.140625
8514763,5,B007CYKHIW,"The third act duets and trio is beautiful. Amazing how two  Mezo sopranos can have such distinct
voices which somehow blend to great harmony. The fairy godmother voice was just okay. The

8514765,5,B007CYKHIW,This fashionable French production of Massenet's Cinderellla opera contrasts with the Met's production of Rossini's La Cenerentola -- each opera bringing out the excence of the other.,1467936000,,183,5.814814814814815
8514766,5,B007CYKHIW,"Rossini's CERENTOLA being hands-down my favorite non-G&S opera, Massenet's version had for me a tough act to follow. There is no competition: Rossini's version remains my favorite. But Massenet's is perfectly beautiful as well. It is melodious, tender, lyrical, very romantic where Rossini's is spiced with broad humor. (There are not a few laughs in the production on this DVD; but it seemed to me the humor here was more in the staging and performances, where in Rossini it is built into the libretto and music.)
I was less than enthusiastic about the stage dressing: tall flats looking like pages out of a French book of -- I must assume -- Perrault's tale, and the barest minimum of furniture. I kept trying to read the flats, which was a little distracting. But not too much. On the whole, if the sets added nothing for me, neither did they get in the way of my enjoyment. The costumes I found excellent, and the casting above reproach. I had to check the cast list to see that Prince Charming was indeed a trousers role and not a counter-tenor (or counter-baritone? I can hear the difference between a bass and a coloratura, when the wind is in the right quarter, but almost never between a soprano and an alto.)
I am very glad indeed I finally took the plunge and made this purchase.",1449964800,6,1290,4.613043478260869

8514768,5,B007CYKHIW,"Bravo to the cast and crew of ""Cendrillon"" from the Royal Opera House production! Joyce DiDonato is absolutely wonderful, charming and shows her dramatic artistry when singing the beautiful arias. Her vocal performance left me breathless. The costume designs were very whimsical, adding a touch of hilarity to such diverse characters, except for Cendrillon, whose gown was made from the ashes, her very place where she slept and waited for something new. In the beginning, Cendrillon, because of her predicament, is muted in grays and black. Everyone else has color, in which red dominates the day of the ball and the royal court.  The fairy godmother, as DiDonato stated, ""They made her into a kind of punk-rocker"", is one fairy you don't want to mess with. She is both mysterious and mischievous.

The most impressive part of the performance was the set design. The fact that the designer used a ""book"" background felt like I was opening the fairytale book before my eyes, and reading the pages as they turned. And in French, no less, a great nod to Charles Perrault, the originator of the story, as well as the Sleeping Beauty classic. It was spell-binding as the characters and workers behind the scenes pulled and pushed forward the different wall sections directly from the background onto the stage and the visual writing continued, from Cendrillon's attic bedroom, to the balcony, and the chimney rooftop forest. . To me, they also took the idea of how Cendrillon was deprived of the glory and beauty of life in general. How she entered from the downstage left through a little door at first, and then main door, I noticed the writing on the walls stopped before her door, as if her own ""story"" was meant to never have been told. Lucky for us, we see her own story unfold- a lowly girl, unwanted by society, given a chance to shine and find love.

What I love about this particular opera is that she has a father figure who loves her dearly, and isn't killed off, like the Disney version at the beginning of the animated film, and for ""La Cenerentola"" where the story is reversed, and the father figure is the step-father, with two daughters who envy each other and walk over the servant girl as is she was a mat. Cendrillon's step mother and step daughters don't interact with her directly until the second act, however, the father informs the empty atmosphere (the audience) of his own daughter's humility, which we have pity for her and we connect with her sorrow and the idea that her wishes must come true.",1411257600,4,2519,4.733485193621868
8514769,4,B007CYKHIW,"This opera can be defined as the superposition of two different stories. On the one hand, two lonely souls, Cinderella and Prince Charming, and on the other hand the comic aspects of the stepmother, her daughters and the other pretenders of the Prince hand.  To unite tem, there is the fairy godmother.  Massenet gives us the appropriate music for each one of the characters and situations.  As expected the most beautiful ones are the emotional outburst of Cinderella and her Prince.  Their arias are highly romantic, deep and soul searching. The joys and pains of deep love are beautifully depicted in the music.  The fairy godmother has her specific musical characteristics that Eglise Gutierrez performs magnificently. The humorous scenes that sometimes border the ridiculous have their own and different musical styles. They are good, but not memorable, and as expected, shallow.  By creating a minimalistic production, the director left the deep romantic scenes talk through the music.  Although the original story is a childs one, Massenet centered most of the work on the introspective aspects of the loneliness and n romantic love between Cinderella and the Prince, and the production succeeded very well in keeping the focus on it instead of focusing on the action and magic aspects of the story.
DiDonato is just perfect for this role, not surprisingly.  Watching and listening to this production is a real joy.  I strongly recommend this DVD.  I don't know of any other DVD version of this opera, which is one more reason to recommend it.  Regrettably, Virgin Classic doesnt provide any information with the DVD. I cant understand that policy!
At least the Bonus pieces give some perspective on the Opera and on this particular production",1396915200,9,1750,5.105263157894737
8514770,3,B007CYKHIW,"5 Stars for costumes (delightfully comic book-ish), and the singing of Cendrillon and Step-mother - both seem to do all that can be done with these roles.
4 Stars for Step-sisters and Fairy Godmother (maybe a 5th star for keeping her immense and over-exposed breasts from falling out of her gown).
Only 3 Stars for Prince: While well sung, cameras close-ups of women playing male roles ruin dramatic realism for me, even in comedies.  Alice Coote has a pretty goofy face for a prince and her voice was too similar to DiDonato's.
2 Stars:
For Massenet's opera, which lacks well paced action and any great melodies, though it feels tuneful in a general way.
For the minimal staging; the budget went for costumes, star roles and orchestra, as often happens these days.
For Cendrillon's father, who acted well but is far past his prime and had basically no voice left.  Whenever he ""sang"" he sounded like (can you forgive me?) a frog.
To conclude; I was almost never carried away by the action.  Stage business was often ""cute"", sometimes too cute and never really funny.  Many excellent individual touches, but nothing calls me to watch this again so I won't.",1362268800,7,1156,4.765
8514771,5,B007CYKHIW,"This is amusing, amazingly musical with the most wonderful voices. The final scene music is heartbreaking. DiDonato is perfect in this vehicle. Ewa Podles is someone we do not hear too much on this side of the world. Anything she does is marvelous.
