8738773,3,B017DT08OI,"The five films included in this boxed set are of varying quality and interest. The Fugitive is probably the best of the bunch, a top-notch thriller based on the long-running TV series -- I saw it when it came out in 1993 and its still enjoyable. Firewall is the worst of the lot -- critics panned Fords performance in this second-rate heist film when it came out in 2006, and it hasn't improved with age. The other three films fall somewhere in between; still, all five will likely please most Harrison Ford fans. That said, Id recommend against buying this collection.  The reason to buy a boxed set is because: 1) its nicely packaged (the box), 2) the collection includes some exclusive extras, 3) the price is attractive vs purchasing the titles individually, or 4) some of the films aren't available except in this boxed set. None of those reasons apply to this collection. There are no special extras. You can buy all of the films individually and the total price will be less than for this set. And most unfortunately, the set was shipped in a rather flimsy carton and arrived with the box crushed as if someone had stomped on it. Ill see if I can post some pictures of the damaged goods.  If Im buying a collectible boxed set, the box obviously matters.  But even if you're lucky and the product isn't crushed or mangled in shipping, this set is still a poor investment.",1475107200,,1377,4.566801619433198
