8109711,5,B000EHL5GC,This is a great video!  I very much appreciated the history of the Besom as well as Peter Paddon's wonderful humor and knowledgable treatment of crafting a traditional Besom.  I took copious notes and learned a lot.  Mr. Paddon is a talented teacher.  I hope this will be the first in a series of videos.,1417219200,,304,4.472727272727273
8109712,4,B000EHL5GC,"I enjoyed this video, but I am glad that I rented it instead of buying.  The author did give a lot of interesting information in a short space, without a lot of ""umms and ahhhhs"" or silly fluff.  I do not enjoy feeling as though my time is being wasted, and in that respect this video did not disappoint.  The pace was fast enough to be interesting, but slow enough that I could follow the information.  The history of the besom was something that I have not run across before and I have been actively researching all things witchcraft for over 20 years.  It was refreshing to learn something new.

The only reason that I did not give a full 5 stars is because sometimes the audio is hard to hear.  I do think that I would like to see if I can find this information in a written format, possibly from the same author/speaker.  I would definitely go to a live seminar with this guy, he seemed personable and engaging as well as authoritative.  I would definitely recommend this video.",1327795200,,983,4.386740331491713

The author made the DVD very interesting, inserting humor and folklore thoughout. A must for anyone who wants to make a proper besom and learn about the history of them!",1200441600,3,280,4.854166666666667
