2175792,4,B00068S3IM,"Wilbur (a wry, sad Jamie Sives) wants out of Life in a bad way and he tries several ways to accomplish his goal: pills, head in oven, slit wrists but he never quite succeeds often due to his personal angel and brother Harbour (a terrific Adrian Rawlins).

Director and screenwriter, Lone Scherfig (the ironic, witty, intelligent ""Italian for Beginners"") packs ""Wilbur"" with a number of very serious topics: suicide, terminal illness, infidelity and proceeds to deal with them in a  manner that  can only be described as ironic: irony with a very light, though often tragic and humane touch.

Schefig's mise en scene is thick and heavy with the detritus of  her characters troubled and out-of-whack lives and even when a woman enters Wilbur and Harbour's life...the winsome Shirley Henderson as Alice things do not get much better but only more complicated.

Scherfig has crafted a very sad, troubling film about people caught up in the past who never quite grow out of that particular quagmire of guilt, shame and remorse. ""Wilbur"" is a difficult movie to comprehend much less love but nonetheless there is much to admire here for anyone looking for the intriguing and unusual.",1148083200,,1177,4.949238578680203
2175793,2,B00068S3IM,"When I got done watching this film all I could see it as was Lone Scherfig's love letter to Hollywood.  During the course of this film he finds multiple ways to pretend that he's Frank Capra, only that he's a hack (and no I was not a fan of ""Italian for Beginners"" either). Let's examine some questions together, shall we? Why does this film contain characters who speak English when clearly this is a Danish director and this film hardly looks to be taking place in an English speaking nation? Why does the film contain a big secret that is held until the end at which point it is revealed and then the characters have to overcome this deception (""She's All That"" anybody?)? Why does the climax take place on Christmas? Why does it also involve a fairy tale ending that is also bitter sweet so that the females in the audience can leave the theatre with two types of tears in their eyes? The answer to all these questions, obviously, is that he thinks that is what the American audiences want (and most of them do, but most of the time I feel bad for humanity). I'm sorry I just didn't buy the fact that while Wilbur wanted to kill himself his brother just happened to have a terminal disease. The fact that it was a matter of life an death allows the audience to get up on their high horses and proclaim that life is ALWAYS worth it, so that at the end when Wilbur discovers life and love we can be vindicated that we were right all along. But what if, instead of dealing with life and death, we were dealing with fame? Then the name of the movie would be ""Entourage."" Looking back on season 1 of that HBO show we can see parallels between Wilbur and his brother, and Vincent and his brother. Only ""Entourage"" is trying to be funny not righteous and the result is much better. In ""Wilbur Wants to kill Himself"" they take an outrageous plot and serve it to the audience with a straight face as a melodrama. That said I have seen much worse movies this year. For filming in Dogma style this film does manage to get some beautiful shot, especially some of sunlight illuminating a bedroom. I also like Shirley Henderson a lot, but I would much rather watch her in a good movie (like ""Intermission"") then dreck like this. I'm sorry but if Wilbur really wanted to kill himself he would have, it looks to me like he was just biding his time until his brother dropped dead so that he could steal his bride. 2.25 out of 5.",1119052800,4,2415,4.342920353982301
2175794,5,B00068S3IM,"Lone Scherfig is a Danish director with a keen sense of character development that allows her to create a film about suicide and cancer into a lovely comedy/drama that walks the thin line of credibility and taste with complete assurance and success.  Co-written with Anders Thomas Jensen WILBUR (WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF) is a story that not only appears to be an absurd topic for a film much less a comedy (albeit a dark comedy), it is a tale about family, relationships, human needs, and love that ably touches us at every turn.

Gloomy Glasgow, Scotland is the setting (cinematographer Jrgen Johansson never lets us forget the impact of the weather on the story) and the primary stage is a Used Bookstore owned by brothers Wilbur (Jamie Sives) and Harbour (Adrian Rawlins), the only remnant of their recently departed father's estate. The store is a shambles with Harbour buying more books than he sells: he is that kind of a compassionate person.  Wilbur has spent his life trying unsuccessfully to commit suicide since the brothers' mother's death when they were children.  We slowly learn that the mother favored Wilbur and while Wilbur's presence hold a strange magnetic attraction for women, Wilbur is unable to partner.  He tries suicide by overdose, hanging, jumping off rooftops, slitting his wrists, etc only to be constantly saved by his loving brother Harbour.

Wilbur is in therapy with a chain-smoking doctor Horst (Mads Mikkelson) assisted by a zany, man-desperate nurse Moira (Julia Davis) who even courts suicide victims such as Wilbur in her need for a man.  Harbour runs the bookstore, one of his steady clients being Alice (Shirley Henderson), a nurse's aide at the hospital where she cleans floors to support her and her pre-teen daughter Mary (Lisa McKinlay), a committed book lover. Alice visits the bookstore daily to sell books she has gleaned at the hospital to the always receptively warm Harbour.  When Alice looses her job at the hospital she is hired by Harbour to organize the bookstore and soon Harbour and Alice fall in love and marry in a Chinese restaurant in a hilarious scene organized by the waiter (Chun-Wah Tsang) whose brogue is thicker than anyone else's!  Harbour, Alice, and Mary have found happiness and Alice insists that Wilbur move in with them.

The 'family' works (with Alice and Wilbur having an encounter which bonds them closely) until Harbour is discovered to have pancreatic cancer and reluctantly begins chemotherapy with Dr. Horst.  The way this crucial development alters the lives of everyone is the climax of the story and while it is fairly predictable, the writing is so fine that to give further details would be an injustice to the viewers.

Each of the relatively unknown actors gives radiantly alive and complex performances.  Wilbur would seem a difficult persona to tolerate, but in Jamie Sives' hands (and of course with the intelligent direction of Scherfig) this miscreant character has us firmly in his hand from the beginning.  This is an intelligent and warmly tender film that explores the human need for love and for belonging.  The only criticism is the lack of English subtitles: the pitch perfect Scottish accents manage to bury much of the bright dialogue for non-Scotsmen's ears!  Very Highly Recommended.

2175795,4,B00068S3IM,"Despite the quirky title, this is not a ""black comedy"" in the ""Harold and Maude"" vein (although the opening scene in ""Wilbur Wants To Kill Himself"" IS suspiciously similar to the opening scene in ""Harold and Maude""!) The film is actually an interesting blend of tearjerker, subtle adult sex comedy and what used to be referred to as (forgive me) ""heartwarming family drama"" (but without the schmaltz). Think a Scottish ""Terms of Endearment"", with more believable characters and less mugging from the actors. The Danish director and her mostly Scottish cast does an impressive job of delivering a fairly large number of characters but still managing to make us care about what happens to all of them; the type of skilled ensemble work that puts this one in the Mike Leigh/Atom Egoyan league. Highly recommended. P.S. For the sake of those who have not seen this film yet, shame on all the reviewers trumpeting major ""spoilers"" in the first paragraph of thier reviews!",1113868800,3,966,4.932515337423313

In ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,"" a young man - who basically lives from one unsuccessful suicide attempt to another - is looked after and cared for by his brother who is suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer.  Moreover, it turns out that the mentally ill brother has designs on the physically ill brother's wife.

It may be hard to believe from that synopsis, but ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself"" is actually a comedy.

Indeed, ""Wilbur,"" filled as it is with quirky characters and offbeat humor, is reminiscent of other well known Scottish comedies such as ""Local Hero"" and ""Gregory's Girl,"" albeit this new film is darker and grimmer in its subject matter and theme.  For in addition to death and illness, ""Wilbur"" also deals with the less tragic topics of adultery and unrequited love.  Like the best Scottish comedies, this film provides us with a slice-of-life tale filled with ordinary, likable people who may have their weaknesses and eccentricities but who also strike chords of familiarity deep within the viewer.

There are beautiful performances by Jamie Sives as Wilbur; Adrian Rawlins as his brother, Harbour; Shirley Henderson as Harbour's's wife, Alice (who is also in love with Wilbur); Lisa McKinlay as Mary, Alice's young daughter, and an assortment of other fine actors and actresses who populate the scene.

Although the script threatens to veer off into melodrama and soap opera from time to time, the truthfulness of the writing and the honesty of the acting keep the film real and believable for most of the duration.  The quiet conversations amongst the various characters, in which feelings are often hinted at and implied rather than explicitly stated, help to elevate the film above its sometimes contrived and maudlin plot.  The movie ends with an ironic twist that shows that one person's death can often lead to a renewal of life for someone else.  It's a fitting finale to a film in which one of the themes is the inextricable nature of human relationships, for what happens to one person happens to them all.  It's a film that not everyone will surely like, but it is a treat for those in search of something a little bit offbeat and a little bit different.",1110499200,2,2200,4.884408602150538
2175797,5,B00068S3IM,"This is a definitely hilarious ultra dark comedy. The opening scene in itself was comical enough to make you break out into laughter, and at the same time make, you feel a bit sad. My first thought was if Wilbur had read the Final Exit by D. Humphrey or any other book that was similar. Wilbur's multiple unsuccessful suicide attempts somewhat reminded me of a much older dark comedy ""Harold and Maude"". Lone Scherfig's choice in actors is good even though the one that plays Wilbur is somewhat unfamiliar, but does an excellent job. The dialog is funny, witty, the scenery is obscure, and so is the subject matter, but this film is brilliantly directed. I highly recommend this film if you are into gloomy comedies and that sort of stuff. I do not want to give the plot away, but some of the twists are a bit unrealistic when you are considering the realities of a chronic suicidal person, but it is just a flick. What the heck, go for it and check it out.",1109030400,,957,4.443181818181818
2175798,5,B00068S3IM,"With ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,"" writer/director Dogma 95 adherent Lone Scherfig follows in the footsteps of Lars von Trier's masterpiece ""Breaking the Waves"" by crafting a film imbued with a black Scottish/Danish inflection.  But where von Trier's vision is uniformly bleak, Scherfig penetrates the grey Edinburgh sky with rays of hope.  Who knew a movie about suicide could be so uplifting?

If you saw and loved Scherfig's delightful ""Italian for Beginners,"" you know of her brilliance with actors.  That talent shows here - Shirley Henderson, Adrian Rawlins and Jamie Sives are magnificent in depicting the leading triumverate.

But, even beyond the three stars, there are neat things to find.  Supporting actresses Julia Davia and Susan Vidler are classically trained British actresses of repute.  Davis won a best supporting actress nomination for her portrayal of quirky nurse/alternative medicine 'student' Moira.  And, watching doctor 'Horst' as portrayed by one Mads Mikkelsen...you got the feeling there was something special about this guy.

There is.  This is Denmark's leading leading man.  As imdb.com notes, ""several polls in magazines and newspapers have voted him sexiest man in Denmark.""  It's always neat to find nice surprises like this tucked into an already enjoyable movie.

So, don't be dissuaded by the awful title.  Rent or buy 'Wilbur' as soon as you can.",1105315200,,1387,5.361111111111111
2175799,4,B00068S3IM,"I originally saw this unusual Danish-Scottish production in the fall of 2003 at the Chicago International Film Festival and was quite impressed with it.  I was disappointed when it did not achieve widespread distribution in the U.S. after this, which is a shame, because it is a very nice movie that has stayed with me.  Thankfully it is now available on DVD.

The movie rests on a central irony:  Wilbur wants to kill himself.  He lives with his brother Harbour, who has taken care of him all his life.  Wilbur's multiple attempts on his life have been unsuccessful, but nonetheless he shows no signs of wanting to live until two events.  First, Harbour gets married to Alice, a woman who works on the cleaning staff at a nearby hospital who meets Harbour when she comes by to sell the books that patients leave behind.  This unsettles Wilbur's life, but nonetheless Alice and Wilbur become aware of a chemistry between them, eventually leading to a sexual encounter.  As they are feeling guilty of betraying Harbour the second shoes falls:  Harbour learns that he is terminally ill.  Wilbur, who has wanted to kill himself, suddenly finds himself wanting to live by the impending loss of his brother, while Harbour, who has wanted to live, tragically learns that he will die.  The complicated interplay between the four central characters (the fourth being Alice's daughter) makes this a fascinating film to watch.

The only thing that keeps this from being a five star film is the unrelenting dismalness of the film.  It isn't merely the downer nature of the plot, which is actually somewhat alleviated by a countervailing affirmation of life that is the ultimate theme of the film; the entire city of Glasgow has never looked more drab and unpleasant than in this film.  Everything is dingy, dark, worn, dilapidated, and bleak.  The bookstore is a precise reflection of the rest of the city, and the apartment a reflection of the bookstore.  The hospital has the same worn, tired look.

The cast does a great job in the film.  I am unfamiliar with Jamie Sieves, who plays Wilbur, but Adrian Rawlins and Shirley Henderson, who play Harbour and Alice respectively, are familiar faces to anyone who sees many movies, even if their names are not familiar.  Both of them appear in the Harry Potter films, Rawlins as Harry's father (always in photos or mirrors) and Henderson as Moaning Myrtle.  She has been extremely busy as a supporting actress, appearing in a wide range of films, including the Bridget Jones movies (as one of Bridget's friends),  24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE, the Mike Leigh film TOPSY TURVY (as a performer with a drug problem), WONDERLAND, and TRAINSPOTTING.  But in all of these roles both of them were at best supporting performers and it is great to see them in a film where they have the central roles.

All in all, this is a very fine film.  It is a great tonic to those who might find themselves feeling ground down by the unending string of big budget films that seem to squeeze quiet, reflective films like this one out of the market.",1100822400,,3056,4.753320683111954
2175800,3,B00068S3IM,"It's difficult to discuss what I liked and disliked ""Wilbur"" without delving into plot developments that are best left to the viewer to experience for herself.  Suffice to say that Wilbur wants to kill himself and after numerous attempts, the hospital refuses to continue treating him psychologically and sends him to live with his generously compassionate brother.  Alternately quirky and sad, but never morbid, the question around which the events unfold is whether Wilbur will eventually succeed or get over himself.

The film is enjoyable enough, though I never felt much empathy with the characters.  The quirkiness is both endearing (in that way that so many Scottish and Irish comedies are) and, at the same time, worn like an affectation.  On balance, I liked it, but wouldn't watch it more than once.",1098748800,,809,5.098484848484849

8040314,4,B00068S3IM,"I am surprised this movie by many is categorized as a comedy... it certainly has humor and a few passages are outright hilarious but that hardly makes it a comedy in my mind. It is the same as classifying a movie a musical because there is a minute or two showing a band or someone singing.

That being said I find this a very beautiful movie and one that leaves you reflecting and emotionally 'activated' generally with positive thoughts but also a few more sad.

Without giving the plot away more than already is done by others, it is a very daring script to write and put into film by both script writer, directors, producers and actors - and almost against expectation they all succeeded. It shows how life and death is an endless cycle and how ones demise becomes another's birth and life.

While the story line is a bit improbable all characters are amazingly portrayed in their complexity. We should all look for the 'Harbor inside of us' while still resting assured that happiness can be found if we live less perfect lives, as do the other characters.

And it shows how far movie makers can come despite low budgets and without the help of special effects and visual tampering. It brings back the essence of story telling to the screen and serves its purpose of inspiring the audience to reflect long after the film is over.",1228521600,,1333,4.564853556485356
8040315,5,B00068S3IM,"Not since last season's ""Lars and the Real Girl"" have I been charmed with such a delightfully odd,quirky and not overly sentimental piece of life in the 2004 Festival Hit ""Wilbur (Wants to Kill Himself).""

What is deceiving about the film's trailer is that you are lead to believe that this is a comedy focused on Wilbur North (an adorable Jamie Sives- (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-the-Ends-of-the-Earth/dp/B000NJL4QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To the Ends of the Earth</a>) who does everything possible to do himself in.  Not so!  In fact, this film is way deeper and far more drama than it is a comedy.  The story concerns itself with two brothers, Harbour and Wilbur North, both orphaned young, both caretakers of sick parents, and both now grown and not connected into anyone.  Harbour is the older brother, and Adrian Rawlins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-Years-1-5-Limited-Edition-Gift-Set/dp/B000W4B8NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift Set</a>) portrays him with such grace and intuitiveness that rarely this actor gets the chance to do.  Harbour is actually the glue of this entire film, running the family bookshop, watching after younger Wilbur, all the while fancying an odd Alice (Shirley Henderson-(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Topsy-Turvy/dp/630589423X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Topsy-Turvy</a>) who is a struggling single mother struggling to survive while working as a cleaning lady for the local hospital.  The hospital is and will become the link between these three as this Scottish film slowly peals back like an onion.  Wilbur is always at the hospital from suicide attempts; Alice is always there cleaning it; and Harbour was always there as the older son who watched his parents die there.  When Harbour and Alice connect, Wilbur becomes a part of their existence and comes to live with them. The film then squarely focuses on these three with Alice's daughter as a fourth.  But things change drastically when Harbour is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  The film shifts into intense mode and all of the characters begin becoming completely three-dimensional.  By the end of this film, I was totally involved in all of their lives!  You can't help it!  One of the best ensemble acting films yet!  Anyone who is a devotee of UK films and T.V. will recognise all of the actors.  This is a chance for them to show their mettle.  Highly recommended!

8040316,5,B00068S3IM,"I thought it was a brilliant film but not a lighthearted one.  I will not provide too much detail as it would ruin the surprises it has in store for the viewer.

This movie packs a seriously emoional punch and it stays with you long after you watch it.  One of the main characters, Wilbur, is constantly trying to kill himself.  After seeing how unhappy and selfish Wilbur acts, I was thinking that everyone would be better off if he just suceeded already.  But I was horrified to later discover the possible cause of Wilbur's constant black moods.  We learn that as a child, Wilbur's mother was sickly and constantly escaped her hospital bed to get home to her family only to be dragged back by her husband so she could survive that much longer.  The dad told his two small sons that their mom couldn't stay home - it would kill her.  In the middle of a cold winter's night, only Wilbur heard the mother knocking on their door.  As she was only wearing a thin hospital gown and Wilbur was too afraid to let her in because he thought she would drop dead (his father's words were taken very literally in his child's mind), she froze to death outside their front door.  This event changed them all.  The father's guilt over what happened, Wilbur's guilt over killing his mother and his older brother's constant sacrifices at his own expense to hold his remaining family together.

Present day finds this family down to the two brothers, Harbour and Wilbur, and we all know one of them is looking for a fast exit.  This movie is layered with so many emotional subjects that hit the viewer hard.  This story is only too real as we watch Alice (the love interest) struggle with poverty and take care of her daughter all on her own, Harbour not being able to help his Wilbur as he struggles with his inner demons, and Wilbur being hostile to everyone as he lashes out, the  male psychiatrist's father/son issues, and every character's loneliness.  The scene where Wilbur is off-handedly cruel to Alice's lonely friend from her old job is heartbreaking.

No surprise that the story ends with just one remaining family member.  But, it does manage to end on a note of hope.  This one family member is not alone, he is rebuilding a family of his own and he owes it all to his brother.  The bond of love between family members can be healing, even the deepest of wounds.

A haunting film that stays with you and I highly recommend it but you have to be in the mood for it.",1203206400,2,2462,4.4630872483221475
8040317,4,B00068S3IM,"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself (Lone Scherfig, 2002)

Why is it, exactly, that some movies that would really be helped by subtitles don't have them, while others do? Scots films, in particular, are notorious for this. My Name Is Joe, Peter Mullan's fantastic flick, was first released without them, but someone figured out right quick that the American release suffered because ninety percent of the audience had no earthy idea what Mullan was saying most of the time. Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself suffers the same way, except no one rectified the error upon the release of the DVD. While you will (hopefully) eventually pick up the accents, unless you are well-used to a thick brogue, you may not be able to figure out what anyone's on about for the first ten or fifteen minutes of this movie. That's a crime, because if you stop watching, you will miss a minor gem of a film.

Harbour (Adrian Rawlins of the Harry Potter franchise) and Wilbur (Love and Other Disasters's Jamie Sives) are brothers who run a bookshop in Glasgow that they inherited from their father. Wilbur, in case you didn't figure it out from the title, is suicidal. Ah, the angst! The brothers are thrown into an uproar when Alice (Shirley Hendersonof the Bridget Jones movies) comes in to sell some books left by patients at the local hospital, where she works (and Wilbur is a frequent guest). Both Harbour and Wilbur fall for her, and her daughter Mary (Lisa McKinlay in her first film role), a bookworm, is enchanted with the store. Soon there's romance, there's drama, there's the well-meaning Alice trying to teach Wilbur how to behave around women so he can land one of the nurses in the suicide ward, who's shown some interest in him, there's Horst (the wonderful Mads Mikkelsen), Wilbur's doctor, there's... oh, just see it.

I opined in my review of Tsotsi about the difference between, in essence, a Lifetime Original Movie and a really good chick flick. Wilbur is a very good example of the latter; the comedy is actually funny, the drama is dramatic (unless it's being played for laughs, like Wilbur's angst), the redemption of the main character feels natural, as opposed to feeling like the product of emotional manipulation. There's a turning point in the film where Wilbur, walking around trying to clear the confusion out of his head, spies a suicide jumping into the river in a place where he had done so before; he jumps in after her and pulls her out. There are so many ways this scene could have gone wrong. Wilbur doesn't eulogize about how he used to be just like her. She doesn't have a sudden change of heart. When Wilbur gets home, covered in water and river grime, and Alice asks him where he's been, the conversation is handled in the most wonderful way possible (it's one of the films' funniest and most understated moments). Scherfig, who co-wrote the film with Anders Thomas Jensen (who would go on to direct the excellent The Green Butchers the same year), really has the touch. And it's just twisted enough that the guys will like it too. ****",1201564800,,3047,4.712945590994371
8040318,4,B00068S3IM,"With a name like, ""Wilbur Wants To Kill Himself,"" one anticipates an odd movie with a dark sensibility - and it is just that - but it's also a warm, touching movie with an inviting sensibility.  The protagonists of WWTKH inhabit a rarified, almost surreal world, but thanks to exceptional acting and direction by Lone Scherfig, who also co-wrote the screenplay, we don't need to be ""sold"" on it, we simply sink into it like a comfy, overstuffed armchair.

The atmosphere of WWTKH is steeped in melancholy that's prototypically Scottish.  Two brothers, Wilbur and Harbour, live is Glasgow, Harbour manages a bookstore left to him by his father.  Though perhaps grand once, it now seems to subsist, barely, on the patronage of one customer who resolutely attempts to purchase works by Kipling.  These brothers have an achingly sad past, both of their parents died in ways certain to leave deep psychic scars.  However, in true Scots fashion, they never discuss the emotional trauma that directs their lives and undermines their tepid attempts at finding happiness.

Wilbur does indeed try to kill himself, several times.  For him, ending it all is somewhere between an avocation and a hobby, so much so that the local suicide support group kicks him out.  The dynamic between the brothers is drawn, Wilbur is a sad loser - Harbour is resilient and strong - an endlessly forgiving and loving caretaker.  Into this odd dynamic strolls another casualty of the storm, Alice, and her enchanting daughter.  Before long Alice and Harbour are married, and it would seem that this newfound stability might have a positive effect on Wilbur as well - creating a safe, extended family.

I won't go beyond this.  WWTKH is not a film of shocking plot twists, but it has its surprises and you should be allowed to enjoy them as they unfold.  At times I had the feeling of watching people who had survived a shipwreck, bobbing on the water, desperately clutching at flotsam and jetsam.  I found it virtually impossible to judge any of them, not even Wilbur, whose obsession with suicide at times seemed a bit narcissistic.  Most likely it is the director's hand that accounts for this, the extreme gentility of this movie.  There is perhaps a little bit of Dear, Frankie here, another ""small movie"" set in Scotland that touches the heart.

Many splendid secondary characters, notably the German doctor - completely believable, and the nurse with eyes for Wilbur.  Truly a wonderful and obscure gem worth tracking down.",1186876800,,2500,4.90952380952381

8040320,4,B00068S3IM,"Wilbur (Wants to Kill Himself) is an emotionally complex film that is, I suspect, subject to a wide range of reactions.  I am somewhat bothered by several aspects of the story as it played out in dramatic fashion, yet I still loved the movie.  There is just something magical and ethereal about the film's atmosphere and characters that make it endearing -even during its most emotionally troubling moments.  It's hard to even classify this film in terms of genre, for it is both everything and nothing.  For me personally, it's a drama with just a few touches of dark comedy, but some will regard it as more of the latter.  Wilbur did not make me feel good or necessarily glad to be alive; its poignancy left me rather subdued, actually.  But - and this is the important part - it certainly made me feel something that stayed with me after the end credits rolled.

One thing this film doesn't do is to take you inside the mind of a suicidal individual.  Wilbur's several attempts at suicide are sort of just there - they aren't funny, yet they are hard to take seriously (with one exception), and his behavior in general suggests very little about the seriousness of his intentions.  More importantly, we never learn why he is suicidal - although one possible clue emerges midway through the film.  I never grew to like or dislike Wilbur (Jamie Sives) to any strong degree.  I found his brother Harbour (Adrian Rawlins) much more fascinating and a much stronger character.  Harbour is one of the few true good guys in the world, the nucleus of his family.  Having cared for their father until his recent death, he now struggles to keep open the family book store and take care of his suicidal brother.  Enter the waiflike Alice (Shirley Henderson), a single mother who comes to the book shop to sell the books that patients' families leave behind in the hospital (where she works as a cleaning lady), and her sweet daughter Mary (Lisa McKinlay).  Harbour and Alice soon marry, and even with the emotional wildcard that is Wilbur, it looks like a truly happy ending is in the works.

This is no fairy tale, however, and the cruel hand of Fate steps in to change these characters' futures dramatically.  As this is happening, the emotional interconnections between all of the main characters grow and evolve in really complex ways.  I have some personal objections to the story as it evolves after this point, but I find myself quite unable to stand in judgment of these truly human characters, especially with the ending playing out as it does.

Wilbur (Wants to Kill Himself), honored with numerous film festival awards, is a beautiful film - and Lone Scherfig's directorial prowess is made manifest by the fact that few artists could have pulled such a film off.  If Wilbur (Wants to Kill Himself) were truly a dark comedy (at least in terms of my definition of the genre), the film would not have worked at all - nor would an exaggerated sense of melodrama have done anything but skewer the film's effectiveness.  Scherfig guides this emotionally complex story with the most subtle of directorial hands, helped along immeasurably by standout performances all around - especially by Adrian Rawlins and Shirley Henderson.  This is definitely a movie worth seeing.",1161475200,2,3264,4.770462633451957
