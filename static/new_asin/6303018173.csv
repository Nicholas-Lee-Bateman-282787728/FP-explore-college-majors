7834557,5,6303018173,First read In Memory of Norman Bethune by Mao. Then buy this movie. The movie shows the transformation from condescending saviour to revolutionary internationalist communist. If you aspire to being a serving humanity-see this movie!,1388188800,,232,5.6571428571428575
7834558,5,6303018173,"This is a film about a little known subject, but after seeing this it will give you an enormously better appreciation of what took place during the 1930s in China. Dr. Norman Bethune, played  by Donald Sutherland, was a Canadian doctor who went to China to help the Chinese fight the Japanese invaders. He was the only doctor in the northern army. As he treated the wounded soldiers he at the same time instructed other soldiers on how to deal with wounds and save soldiers' lives. Tragically, he cut himself on a gangrene-infected bone and since there was no medicine for this he died within a few days. Mao Tsetung wrote an essay about this altruistic ""international man"" and it is still being taught in Chinese schools. It is a fabulous film!",1361577600,,745,4.643939393939394
7834559,5,6303018173,"Its a shame it hasn't been released on dvd. An extraordinary man that lived a great life in historic times. He experienced the first socialist state in history, the. Soviet union, and was inspired by their egalitarian healthcare system. He served as a field medic for the communist forces in the spanish civil war and also served Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army in the chinese revolution.",1334102400,,394,4.984848484848484
7834560,5,6303018173,"I don't quite understand why this film does not rank up there with other monumental classics such as Lawrence of Arabia, etc.  Perhaps it's the politics and the relative obscurity of the protagonist: how exciting can a film about a doctor be, right?!

This is a true classic.  I regret I've never seen it on the big screen, where its power and cinematographic beauty would no doubt come to life!  The cast is phenomenal - particularly Sutherland, whose strength as an actor really shines.  The beauty of the landscapes is overwhelming.  The story is inspiring.  The script is well crafted, every detail contributing to the conveyance of meaning.

What I particularly value in this film is that the excellence of production is not wasted on a vacuous story, as is so often the case today!  Seeing this film is really a worthwhile, edifying, illuminating, and instructive experience - not to be missed!  The real-life story of Dr. Bethune teaches us not only about history (which is valualbe insofar as those lessons are brought to bear upon our current predicament), but also, and more importantly, about human character - its frailties and strengths, its conflicted beauty and ugliness, and above all its transcendent moral capacity.

Obtain a copy of this film and share it with your friends!",1232928000,5,1293,4.939814814814815
7834561,5,6303018173,"It is one of the best movies, in my opinion, that Donald Sutherland ever made. The subject of Dr. Bethune should be taught in classrooms wherever possible. The man and his work is that important. I wish everyone, that has the chance, would view this video and the wonderful performance of Donald Sutherland as he portrays Dr. Bethune.",991526400,7,334,4.775862068965517
7834562,3,6303018173,"The film you can only unterstand if you know the life of Dr. Norman Bethune or Pai Chiu-en. To often the film plays in different times.  It was a long way to make this film and how the book ""The scalpel, the  sword"" here are the same mistakes. For instance the operation of his  own illness - the tuberkulousis - in the sanatorium Bethune not maked  himself, he has got the operation by Dr. Warren. Better you read the book  from Larry Hannant written in 1998 (University of Toronto Press).",945907200,3,490,4.4
