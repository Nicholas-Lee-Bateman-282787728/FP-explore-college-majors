It's hard to know just what to make of the Japanese film, ""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai.""  Is it a parody of a softcore porn flick or just a softcore porn flick itself?  I tend to think it's the former, since, along with its myriad (and fairly graphic) simulated sex scenes, the film is also a wildly funny, tongue-in-cheek absurdist farce, replete with social criticism and political commentary for the deeper thinkers in the crowd. Not all of it works equally well, but you at least gotta' give `em props for trying.

Sachiko Hanai is an attractive young tutor with what a polite person might describe as an ""active interest in sexual expression.""  Despite her job as a teacher, Sachiko is no great shakes in the brains department, until, that is, she is accidentally shot in the forehead by a secret agent from North Korea.  Due to the bullet's strategic placement in the cerebral cortex, Sachiko suddenly becomes a super genius, able to comprehend French philosophy, complex laws of physics and arcane mathematical equations with no trouble whatsoever.  She also develops a paranormal ability to peer into the unseen mysteries of the universe and to foretell future events.  Her condition, however, does not curtail her appetite for sex; in fact, if anything, her newfound intelligence seems only to exacerbate it.

Indeed, much of the fun of ""Schiko Hanai"" derives from the incongruous juxtaposition of raw sexuality with intellectual pretentiousness.  There's something immensely funny about watching people make passionate love while debating the finer points of dialectical materialism and String Theory or using Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky as aphrodisiacs.  The actors help to pull it off by playing their scenes with a straight-faced, deadpan seriousness that enhances the humor.

The plot gets even weirder when Sachiko finds herself in possession of the cloned, self-animated finger of George W. Bush and the machine that would allow it to unleash an arsenal of deadly nuclear weapons on an unsuspecting world.  How's that for a storyline?

I frankly have no idea what this spy thriller cum sex comedy is really all about, but I had a great deal of fun watching it just the same.",1186444800,8,2208,5.03021978021978
2799471,4,B000OT6V2S,"The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai is, without a doubt, the weirdest movie I have ever seen in my life.  Dubbed by one critic a ""weird, hilarious wet dream for intellectuals,"" this film attempts to meld satirical, political messages with lots of kinky sex.  As a Japanese film being distributed in America by Palm Pictures, it's unrated; if it were to be rated, however, it might be pushing its luck just to get an NC-17 rating over here.  Before some of you start scrolling back up to hit that Add to Cart button (and you know who you are), let me just add that the sex scenes can be as disturbing as they are erotic, as some of them equate to rape.  You need to know what you're getting into, as those who rarely venture down some of the dark cinematic paths that I walk may find themselves shocked and embarrassed pretty darn quickly.  The politics of the story won't appeal to all intellectuals by any means.  Frankly, I think a lot of folks are like me and won't completely understand the message the story is trying to convey, but leftists will pretend to understand it just because they will interpret it as anti-Bush.  As a conservative, I can't say that anything in this film particularly bothered me (it's nothing compared to, say, any given day in the U.S. Senate - only with a lot more sex).  The cover of the DVD asks the question: Can a genius call girl save the world?  I still don't know, as the ending seems to go off in a whole different direction.

Sachiko Hanai is a call girl who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up taking a bullet right in the middle of her forehead.  Remarkably, not only does she survive, she gets up and walks out of the place.  Strangely enough, almost no one throughout the rest of the film will even mention that big, glaring entrance wound in her forehead.  It does have some definite effects on her, though.  Her senses react to stimuli long after they should have, she starts devouring all the books she can get her hands on, she sometimes hallucinates, she has the ability to predict certain things about the future, she suffers from periodic bouts of masturbatory passion (apparently a delayed reaction to her increasingly unemotional sexual encounters), and - oh yeah - she becomes some kind of super genius who goes around quoting all kinds of philosophers.  It must also make her irresistible to men, as all of the men she comes in contact with throw caution to the wind and use her to sate their own perverse desires.

It turns out that she stumbled away from what should have been her murder with a certain object that a North Korean spy really wants back.  In hallucinatory fashion, President George W. Bush (actually, just a crude caricature of him) appears to her and tells her that the object contains a cloned version of his own finger (which he then manipulates in a Bill Clinton-like manner).  She stays with a professor for awhile, serving as a tutor to his son (and boy does she know how to make a teenaged boy want to learn the answers to all of her questions), but the North Korean bad guy keeps searching until he finds her.  As for that professor, he prefers philosophical discussions to dirty talk, all but busting a nut at the very mention of Noam Chomsky.  (See, I told you this was one weird mamma jamma of a movie.)

I won't pretend to have completely understood this movie, especially the ending.  Still, I enjoyed watching The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai, mainly because it is unlike any other film I've ever seen.  I feel pretty confident saying that a lot of people won't really understand or enjoy it at all, though.  That is one of the reasons I've tried to stress the fact that this is a ""pink film"" that walks a fine line between soft porn and true X-rated material, especially in terms of a couple of nonconsensual sex scenes.  You even get a few money shots here and there (although the first one is completely unrealistic for any man walking this earth).  I'm not criticizing the film for its sexual content (far from it, actually); I'm just trying to make sure potential viewers know about it in advance.  Just know what you're getting into before watching this film, and be sure to keep it out of the hands of any minors.

On a final note, don't hit Stop when the credits begin to roll, as there is some additional material tacked on at the end.",1184112000,2,4363,4.495564005069708
2799472,5,B000OT6V2S,"Palm Pictures has put some pretty interesting foreign movies such as Akarui Mirai (Bright Future) with Asano Tadanobu, but Hanai Sachiko No Karei na Shogai is one of the most brash, funny, and downright sexiest films I've ever seen, hence the X-rating, so be warned.

Call girl Sachiko Hanai is shot in the forehead by a North Korean agent.  She survives, but the lodged bullet penetrates the center of her brain (via some mind-blowing but crude animation) and turns her into an intellectual genius.  We can tell because she starts scribbling physics equations on the wall with a piece of chalk, and she becomes fascinated with French philosophy, and the genius of humankind--""all  that is man's passion released towards the Universe.""  However, one amusing side effect is the havoc it plays on her taste buds.  And the bullet hole makes for a grisly parody of the red bindi Indian women have on their forehead, although in Sachiko's case, it signifies the major nerve point in the human body--see what the bullet did to her?

Sachiko runs into the bookish Professor Toshio Saeki, and so touched is he with her intelligence he doesn't think twice of having an affair with her.  He is one of the funniest characters.  I mean, someone who gets turned on by anyone saying ""Noam Chomsky?""  Sachiko then tutors his shy and antisocial son Mamoru.  Did I say shy and antisocial?  With Sachiko, not for long, and what better reward to get right answers than by her removing a piece of clothing.  What was it Van Halen sang, ""Got it bad, so bad, I'm hot for teacher""?

Mamoru is keen on military defense maneuvers and missiles.  ""We'll always have wars.  It's a good occupation,"" he says. This leads to Sachiko learning how  ""the TDF missile system is manipulated by the Bush administration, neoconservatism and the military industry that supports it.""  And speaking of Dubya, he gets a great drubbing here for the war in Iraq.  He appears via some crude animation but by someone wearing a mask of freeze frame pictures of him.  Turns out that Sachiko accidentally took Dubya's cloned finger that the North Korean agent's after.  However, the scene of the finger violating her on the rooftop is queasy, not because it involves a writhing Sachiko being aroused, but because it's horrible to have Dubya to that to anyone, especially a sweet cute intellectual call girl like Sachiko.

The mission accomplished"" speech is horribly but funnily dubbed, with references to his superweapon that pinpoints America's enemies one by one.  ""My intention is to have ""naturally friendly wars"" he says.  Naturally friendly wars....RIGGHHHHTTT!

As for the North Korean agent, he's not exactly a nice guy, shooting people and even violating the professor's wife--a kind of nasty scene right there.  But he ends up having a conscience later on.  Hey, if it happened to Darth Vader in Jedi....

The film is clearly a throwback to the late 60's/early 70's softcore underground flicks such as Doris Wishman's Double Agent 73 or Pete Walker's The Tale of Tiffany Jones, but since when did Chesty Morgan or Tiffany go full-frontal or have something white squirted on them?--and I don't mean mayonnaise!  Check out the dayglo pink cover of the DVD, not to mention Sachiko's outfit.  Typical go-go girl/exploitation.  And Sachiko being exploited by whoever she meets is straight from Candy by Terry Southern, although she does tend to give of herself to begin with.  Then you have apocalyptic elements of Dr. Strangelove and elements of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911.

Emi Kuroda as Sachiko is clearly the star and a likeable one too, with or without clothes.  Her teacher outfit at the beginning is a knockout.  And her rendition of the Star Spangled Banner is definitely more appealing than Borat's.  Sheer, unabashed, sexy delight for liberals, aficionados of 70's softcore cinema, and anyone who loves contemporary Japanese cinema.  Sachiko, please be my teacher!

""Those who tell others to face reality are usually not facing it themselves.""--Mamoru to Sachiko.",1179964800,7,4034,4.992503748125937
2799473,1,B000OT6V2S,"So, the story behind this movie seemed interesting; a director has to make a ""pink film"", and uses it to convey his own message, to develop his own movie in between the softcore sex scenes.

But he gets everything wrong from the beginning to the end. Well I should be fair; we couldn't even make it to the end of this movie.

Surprisingly bad acting is coupled with random sentences which try to sound intellectual; however, in practice this ""intellectual"" part is probably the deeper dumbness you can find in an already dumb script.

As if this wasn't enough, the movie is wrapped in an unpleasant sexist concept around sex scenes, which gets to its climax in a trivialized rape sequence which made us viewers think now the movie wasn't even worth to make fun of anymore.",1179014400,6,772,4.62043795620438
2799474,5,B000OT6V2S,"Other reviewers have covered plot lines and the gist of this movie, however I enjoyed this film and I sent the purchasing information to many friends. This film is rather graphic (not gory, but sexually graphic), yet the combination of ""discourses on existentialism"" connected with sexuality and ""satire on the Bush administration"" is interesting.

This movie is trippy.  I watched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glamorous-Life-of-Sachiko-Hanai/dp/B000OT6V2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai</a>"" straight, but I would recommend having a margarita before watching it.  This is sort-of like a new style of '70s B movie, and unlike anything else that I have seen; therefore, this movie is difficult to categorize.  I agree with another reviewer that John Waters fans would probably enjoy this film.  Also, people who enjoy obscure movies such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B00004U8P9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rocky Horror Picture Show (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>"" will probably like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glamorous-Life-of-Sachiko-Hanai/dp/B000OT6V2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai</a>.""

The send-up of ""W"" (from a Japanese perspective) is very strange and worth watching.  If you read between the lines, during a certain scene in which ""W's"" cloned finger goes on an adventure....well, let us suffice to say that That One Scene summarizes a World View of the current situation.

Some of the more delicate folks might need to fast-forward through the sex scenes, but I am letting people know about this movie , because you probably will not see much publicity about this film.  PALM PICTURES produces such films as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Heart-Is-Deceitful-Above-All-Things/dp/B000F1IO3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things</a>"" (which has a Marylin Manson cameo).

Mark Schilling, of the Japan Times, states that this movie is ""A weird, hilarious wet dream for intellectuals!""  I agree.  This movie would also cause some serious wet dreams if teenagers got their hands on it.  This is definitely one to keep away from the children, yet the movie is fun for adults.  I have a feeling that many people will skip to certain scenes and show those particular scenes during parties and get-togethers.

If you have the slightest clue about what is going on in the world you will enjoy the non-sexual aspects of the film.  I will definitely watch this film again, most-likely after having a margarita, and I will share scenes with friends so that they will acquire their own copy.

I believe this film could become a Cult Classic amongst the Philosophical and Intellectual crowd.  Many activists and Alternative Thinkers will enjoy ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glamorous-Life-of-Sachiko-Hanai/dp/B000OT6V2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai</a>"" as well.

2799475,3,B000OT6V2S,"Mix soft-core porn with political satire and what do you get? This. And what is this? Well, to be honest, I'm not quite sure what The Glamorous Life of Sachico Hanai is. It's something so different it's indescribable. One simply must see it to form their own opinions. One who is of age of course.

The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai follows a rather eccentric call-girl as she goes about saving the world. But before that, she meddles into affairs she had no right meddling in, and ends up getting herself shot... in the head... and she doesn't die. Huh? Well, anyways, this bullet wound grants her mysterious powers of the intellect. She finds an insatiable interest in classic literature, and randomly spouts out the scientific laws of some of history's greatest scientists. While doing this, she finds herself the target of a hit-man who is hunting down a strange metal cylinder containing an object that could destroy the world, thermonuclear style. Oh, and she has plenty of sex along the way.... As for the cylinder, I won't say what's in it, only that it's red, white, and blue, has something to do with the American presidency, fits quite well in a porn, but isn't what you're thinking right now at this very moment (and if you're not thinking what I'm thinking you're thinking, then bless you; if you are, get your mind out the gutter).

Now, how to recommend something this different. All I can say is that if you're a fan of John Waters films, then you'll absolutely love this. If you like soft-core porn, then this may be good for you. If you enjoy foreign films, and don't take them too serious, then I'd recommend you at least try this film out. Outside of those people mentioned, I can't rightly say that anyone else would find any interest in this movie. The film-work and special-effects look obviously under-budgeted, the sex-scenes are distasteful at times (most of the time, really), and there are far too many contrived moments for this film to ever be taken too seriously. The political satire definitely drives this film, but it isn't enough to make this movie good. In the end, I say that this movie is neither good, nor bad; The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai is just different.",1178236800,4,2206,4.6976744186046515
2799476,5,B000OT6V2S,"The Glamorous Life Of Sachiko Hanai is a fascinating and entertaining slice of Japanese filmmaking. Combining humour, erotica, theories of evolution, existentialism, action, secret agents, hit men, nutty professors and a gorgeous and talented leading lady whose transformation (ala Cliff Robertson's Charly) from a simple fun loving call girl into a voracious knowledge seeking femme fatale is first rate.

She is ably supported by a talented cast and the film itself keeps one's interest til the last scene.

The special effects are an homage to 1960s escapist fare and the erotic interludes range from subtle to completely over the top.

Interestingly the film is also a learning experience as we discover things at the same time as Sachiko including The Chaos Theory.

The idea of George Bush's cloned finger, which is painstakingly dispensed through a squeaky lipstick holder is both clever and hilarious.

I especially like the U.S. Flag on the fingernail!

Add this DVD to your collection today. You will not be disappointed.",1178236800,2,1031,5.2560975609756095
2799477,4,B000OT6V2S,"After exhaustively stumbling into a restaurant from a recent ""job"", a cute little asian call girl is shot in head during an altercation therein, lodging a bullet in her brain, stimulating super-genius comprehension, akin to Homer Simpson's up-the-nose crayon which normalizes him. The killer becomes aware of her identity and residence by acquiring her cellphone which was dropped during the scuffle. Turns out she accidently made away with an object saught by the secret-spy-assassin. Tiring of waiting for her at her apartment, he finally sets out to find her after imbibing her mother's gracious meal.

This imbedded object also yields hallucinations and uncontrollable arousal which manifests spontaneously. The hallucinations contain political satyr on American President George Bush, whose cloned finger adorned with an American flag emerges from a lipstick container to molest Sashiko as well as drive the bullet back into place to preserve her under control, where she travels from place to place as a veritable zombie, seducing a professor and his son, a random businessman, and is even taken by a police officer while in a hypnogogic state.

Comparisons can be made with the Bush finger representing western-originated morality being imposed upon international cultures, via media programming and military infiltration.

The erotica is in the so-called ""pink"" sinemaerotica presentation, wherein genitalia is not actually shown, although the situations are quite stimulating nonetheless, with copious quotes from Noam Chomsky and discussion on quantum physics during intercourse!

She eventually realizes that she has the ability to destroy the world via a transmitter-box with the capability to launch nuclear missles across the face of the earth, thus initiating World War Three. But wouldn't you know it, at the very last moment, while ambling upon the beach right after a cave massacre, the bullet falls right out her head, whereupon she resumes a vapid mentality, apparently forgetting all which transpired...

The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai is a sinemaerotic thriller, asserting artistic political commentary with a subtle James Bond twist. Although I do not agree with all of the political and philosophical sentiments expressed in this film, the mental and erotic stimulation is a remarkable combination well done herein. The imagination and writing placed into this presentation is commendable, and could very well mark an evolution in the Sinemaerotic genre.",1178064000,3,2483,5.558201058201059
2799478,1,B000OT6V2S,"The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai is a Japanese Pink film which is part pseudo-soft porn and part avant-garde political satire. What is a Japanese Pink film? From various sources I learned that Pink Films have a long history in Japan which couple sex and more recently a political message in the film. Often the sex is rough and even misogynistic, which certainly fits this film. This movie is of that genre. All I can say is it fails at being sexy, titillating, or delivering a clear political message.

First, let me describe the plot, which isn't complicated but is certainly bizarre. Sachiko is a call girl specializing in role playing and fantasy. She just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when a North Korean spy is trying to buy an object and being unsatisfied that the buyer seems to have lost the goods, he goes on a little shooting rampage hitting Sachiko square in the forehead. She lives and leaves the cafe where the shooting takes place, but with the object of desire. What is it you say? None other than President Bush's cloned finger which could set off a nuclear disaster.

After leaving the caf Sachiko discovers the bullet in her head, once she places the finger in the hole, makes her a super genius with a penchant for math, philosophy, and occasional glimpses into the future, although not always a real one. She then seduces a philosophy professor, and his son, and lives with them while hiding from the North Korean who has camped out in her apartment waiting for her to return. She also discovers, in the only scene that is really hilarious, that President Bush's cloned finger is the one object that can truly satisfy her carnal desires.

Still with me? Ridiculous I know, but I must go on.

The North Korean ends up finding Sachiko in a rather lame plot twist when the philosophy professor's wife goes to a private investigator to find out who Sachiko really is because she knows Sachiko has seduced her son. The private eye is none other than the North Korean operative. Rather uncreative writing there, I know. He then snatches her and the finger along with her and she leads him to a remote control device, through her extra sensory powers I guess, that can set off the United States' nuclear weapons. No wonder the North Korean's want it, right?

After a little bit of sex and a gun fight with more North Korean's trying to get the finger, Sachiko takes some actions of her own, which I'll leave for the reader to ponder (or suffer through the movie to find out).

There is a line toward the end of the movie by Sachiko ""Chaos is nonsense. Nonsense is the law of the world. But you shouldn't try to change it."" If there is a message buried in this movie somewhere this must be it. The movie itself is chaotic and nonsensical and fails on every other level. As soft porn it fails because the sex is more caricature than anything else, that of rough men taking what they want. In fact, there is even a gratuitous rape scene in the movie. As political satire it also fails, unless the aforementioned quote is the point. Most seeing this film already know the points it tries to make - that United States has more weapons of mass destruction than any other country, that some see Bush as a buffoon and a war monger, and the implication that the United States is imperialistic. This is old news.

This review may be an indictment of Pink Films in general. I don't really know as I've never seen one before. But I do know I won't be going out of my way to see another one either.",1177977600,,3524,4.496875
2799479,4,B000OT6V2S,"Boy, was I excited to get my hands on a copy of ""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai"" recently! Why? Because it's the first time I've ever received a screener copy of a movie! Yay! After reviewing over 600 movies (I think it's 600. Might be more or a little less.), I finally get the recognition I deserve. I'm being sarcastic with that last line there. I'm still glad to get a free copy of the film for review, however. I'd rather be on the mailing list at Lionsgate, Anchor Bay, Unearthed Films, Tartan, Shriek Show, or any of the other companies that put out horror and exploitation movies on a regular basis, but I'll take what I can get in the meantime. That means sitting down with ""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai,"" pen and paper clutched in my sweaty little hands so I can make my little review scribbles, in order to give the film the sort of serious, professional attention one would expect from the likes of Roger Ebert or Pauline Kael. Of course, it's unlikely Roger Ebert or Pauline Kael would watch a movie like this one. Read on to find out why.

""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai,"" directed by a chap named Mitsuru Meike, tells the story of a Japanese sex worker named, not surprisingly, Sachiko Hanai. We first see her working with one of her clients, posing as a ""naughty teacher"" upbraiding the recalcitrant ""student"". Yes, there's a money shot. Then we move on as Hanai goes to a restaurant to await a meeting with her boss. While she's waiting, one of the two men haggling at a nearby table drops a metal cylinder on the floor after Hanai bumps into him. The owner of the place picks the tube up and puts it in her purse because he thinks the object belongs to her. In the next minute, one of the guys at the table shoots his companion and then pumps a slug into Hanai's forehead. Incredibly, she awakens and stumbles out the door. Her life doesn't seem so glamorous up to this point, but then she happens to push that slug further into her brain (don't ask) which sets off some sort of cheesily depicted ""reaction"" that results in delayed response times to things like hot food and sweet tea, increased intelligence, the ability to see into the future, heightened sex drive, and a ravenous desire to absorb information.

Sachiko roams around the streets of the city, writing equations on walls and reading books, before seeking out a professor of philosophy at a nearby university. The two really hit it off, doing the bump and grind as they spout nonsensical references to various philosophical belief systems. Whatever floats your boat. Then Hanai ends up moving in with the professor in order to teach his son. More hijinks ensue, not the least of which involves Sachiko discovering what's in that shiny metal tube. It's a clone of George Bush's trigger finger! Oh yeah. Before you can say, ""I'm the decider,"" that finger is doing things to Hanai best left unmentioned here while a televised Bush manipulates said digit in the most obnoxious manner possible. I started losing my bearings at this point, but I can say that the guy who shot the other chap in the restaurant shows up at the professor's house looking for that cylinder. Hanai hooks up with him and the two head off to a cave (?) where they find an important device that might explain the importance of the finger. Or maybe not. By the time the film rolled to a stop, I was mystified in the extreme.

I'll say one thing about ""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai"": make sure to keep watching after the credits. O.k., I'll say a bit more. This is one confusing film. I'm still not sure what I watched. I also have little idea about the film's underlying theme. Is it an anti-Bush flick? A statement about the exploitation of Japanese sex workers? A critique of the relationship between North Korea and Japan? You got me. I think the best way to explain this film revolves around the constant nudity and sexual situations. It's more a soft-core film of the type one sees on Cinemax than a serious statement about the condition of the world. It's also hilarious in spots. I loved how we can see the string holding up the flying metal cylinder, and I also cracked a grin over the poorly synchronized sound effects. There's no doubt director Mitsuru Meike operated on a shoestring budget here. What saves the movie, at least for me, is the cuteness factor of the actress who plays Sachiko Hanai. She's quite the little babe, and it's easy to forgive cheap effects and a hazy plot when she embarks on yet another tryst.

I'm at a loss to rate this film. It's so incredibly weird, corny, and warped--and often all three at the same time--that the movie defies traditional categories of good and bad. I'll go with four stars for the audacity factor alone. I mentioned above that I watched a screener copy. The only extra included on my disc is a trailer, but the back of the case claims that the special features in the street release (subject to change, of course) should include the original Japanese trailer, the U.S. trailer, a feature called ""What is Pink Film,"" which probably explains what genre this movie falls into, previews for other movies, and two short films: ""The Adventure of Sachiko Hanai"" and ""Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice"". As for picture and sound quality, both aren't that great due to the film's low budget. Subtitles were difficult to see at times. So there ya go. If anything I've described above appeals to you, by all means pick up a copy when this DVD hits the streets in June of this year. Good luck, my friends!",1177804800,5,5536,4.583249243188698

A long lost friend of mine called this a surrealistic Japanese art film laced with softcore erotica.  She was totally correct.  Although she's not as susceptible to being brainwashed by an abundance of female nudity, I still think she short-changed the greatness of this odd little sexy gem.

Quick plot synopsis:
Super-sexy Sachiko gets shot in the head by a North Korean spy.  The bullet gets lodged in her brain, ironically making her super-smart.  Not to mention super-horny.  To top it all off, she has some sort of psychic control of George Bush's cloned finger.  Ahh yes, time to push some buttons.

The political backdrop is interesting but not especially significant or well-developed.  It seemed this film was on the brink of something truly special, but it never quite materialized.  Then again, maybe I was just too focused on the fact that Sachiko looks great naked.  All in all, this is excellent as a sleaze film but nearly becomes something so much more.  3.5 stars.",1239321600,2,993,4.874251497005988
8186617,4,B000OT6V2S,"The GLAMOROUS LIFE of SACHIKO HANAI is a piece of Japanese `pink' cinema directed by Meike Mitsuru (Bitter Sweet). Its original incarnation titled ""Hatsujo kateikyoshi; sensei no aijiru"" has become such a cult hit in Japan that the producers decided to expand this feature film. A pink film is softcore porn, similar to the ones you see on late night cable; but with a more in-depth characterization, narrative, and cinematography. These three qualities play a vital part as with its titillation and erotic factors. I've read that ""pink"" cinema proved to be a starting point even for such acclaimed Japanese directors as Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Kairo) and Yogiro Takita. I will try to avoid using the word titillation again and this is my second time reviewing a pink film so forgive me if I slip.

Sachiko (Emi Kuroda) is a call girl who specializes in tutor/student fantasies. One evening, while she is waiting for a friend in a caf, she gets shot in the head. Amazingly, she doesn't die and ends up having sex with a cop. Next day, with a major headache, Sachiko finds the bullethole in her forehead and sticks a pencil inside. She inadvertently pushes the bullet further into her brain and for some reason she gains superhuman intelligence.
Now, with a vast intellect and an appetite for sex, she turns her lust for knowledge for the musings of Noam Chomsky, Sartre and Sontag; along with the theories of a native professor named Saeki (Hotaro Yukijiro). After she tracks him down by having intercourse with him, she ends up becoming the professor's son's tutor. However, Sachiko has stumbled upon the cloned `trigger' finger of a certain American president which can be used to launch America's nuclear arsenal and she must dodge North Korean spies such as Kim (Takeshi Ito) who wants to get his hands on the cloned finger...

Sounds silly, doesn't it? Well, the film is definitely not for everyone but those who are looking for an inventive and oddly clever Japanese film, then this movie may be for you. After hearing about this movie last year via the net, I was dead intrigued and boy, was I not let down. It is a genuine ""pink"" film; it has philosophy, titillation, full frontal nudity, and is quite silly and insane but at the same time inventive and original. The film does have its servings of whacked humor through its political references. It also points an accusing metaphor to a certain American president; an individual wears a cut-out photo of the President in a TV while this man telepathically controls the cloned finger to violate our heroine. I was wondering whether there is a political theme to all of Sachiko's ramblings or monologues; as to why and what is the point of all that. I think they may be just an attempt to poke or make fun of itself. Don't take this movie seriously, it's just a fun ride. How can you take a film seriously that features a cloned finger that gets to--(you know what I mean)

Emi Kuroda is quite nice to look at; she can act, she's cute, curvaceous and has no qualms about showing all her ""stuff"". Her character experiences sexual arousal and orgasm when she hears ""Noam Chomsky"", which has to be a first in any cinema. Discussing dialectical materialism and theories while having sex is also very funny. There are about 7 scenes of vigorous sex (maybe more) and all of them are just 5-12 minutes away from each other. After awhile, Sachiko seems to have lost any feeling while having intercourse but experiences the entire feeling of being touched and even orgasm minutes after the act. This factor adds a lot of bizarre sequences that ends up with Sachiko, well, treating herself. The film is a skin flick but some scenes proved not too entirely titillating in a conventional sense. The scenes highlight some cultural differences in regards to Japanese erotica. Sachiko is taken advantage of, whether by sexual role play or while incapacitated, she seduces a high-school kid or becomes violated by a certain finger are all products of its genre. Folks who see this for its titillation factor and nudity won't be disappointed but they will also think that the film is a hoot--and downright whacked. If you see this film, then maybe you're a bit whacked yourself. (I know I am)

The philosophy is relevant to the film`s narrative, believe it or not. The scenes wherein Emi Kuroda reaches sexual rapture is a very original touch and the film definitely embraces exactly what it is. Its proceedings exude ""pink"" erotica and even with its very little budget which was evident in the visible wires on the cloned finger (which maybe or not intentional), I enjoyed what I saw? I guess I do have a whacked-out side after all.

Emi Kuroda breathes life and charm to her role even when she isn't in a state of undress (which isn`t often). She has all the tools to be sexy, humorous and enigmatic. The film does stay grounded and the movie is fun to watch. I found myself laughing quite a number of times. It is not for everyone's tastes and embodies the term ""Oddball Erotica"" and will amuse those who love campy, a bizarrely structured storyline with a touch of titillation. The film is a Hoot, enjoy it for what it is, pure guilty pleasure! How many times did I say titillation, did you keep track?

Recommended timidly to fans of Japanese Cult films [3  Stars]

8186618,5,B000OT6V2S,"I am a big fan of the Japanese Pink Film genre.  Quite different from straight porn, they were a hugely successful category of film mainly in the 70's, where they played to packed theaters, but now mainly exist on straight-to-video releases and still manage to thrive.  Most of the time they are just cheesy as hell; some hot naked girls and only a stitch of plot, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Vixens/dp/B000IHYVP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Vixens</a>&nbsp;series. Sometimes they are dark and plumb psychological depths, like the infamous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-Snake/dp/B0008FPITU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower & Snake</a>.  And sometimes they are just plain weird.

""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai"" is clearly in the last category.  Although it started out as a straight Pink Film, with the more explicit title of ""Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice"", director Meike Mitsuru decided to re-cut and re-shoot it as a flick that has all the nudity and sex required, with a bizarre plot that could play at an Indie film festival.  In fact, this is the first Pink Film ever to get distribution in US theaters, mainly on the festival circuit.

The story revolves around Sachiko Hanai, a prostitute who works at an Image Club doing a ""seduce the teacher"" routine that is a common fantasy of Japanese guys.  One eventful night leaves her with a bullet in her head and in possession of the cloned finger of George W. Bush.  The bullet has logged against her brain, giving her a genius-level intellect and various mental abilities.  Bush's finger has a mind of its own, being able to move and communicate to Sachiko via television screens, as well as some more subtle manipulations.

While the political message is hazy at best, with the cloned finger being hunted by North Korean agents in order to gain access to Bush's fingerprints and thus America's nuclear arsenal, it is mainly just decoration and a bit of a McGuffin.  The real fun is just in following Sachiko Hanai's glamorous life, and her lust for knowledge and other things. Along with her genius IQ, the bullet also delays all of her body's responses, so that she experiences things after the fact, such as when she makes a super-spicy curry but thinks it is too bland until and hour later when her mouth is one fire.  Given that this is a Pink Film, several of her other body responses also happen to delayed and hilarious effects.

The lead actress, Kuroda Emi, makes a very hot school teacher and isn't ashamed at all in showing off her talents.  This was her only flick, and she soon gave up the Pink Film genre for a new career as a fighter in the Mixed Martial Arts circuit. Most of the other actors are veterans of Japan's various underground genres, like Hotaru Yukijiro who appeared in the strange zombie flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stacy/dp/B000096IAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stacy</a>.  The sex in the film isn't explicit, but is definitely good enough and it is great to see Emi do her stuff.

The DVD for ""The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai"" is a winner, with some cool extras thrown in.  The original incarnation, ""Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice"" is included, as well as a funny little short featuring the Sachiko Hanai character and a George Bush puppet doing a Smack Down style fight against another girl in a ICBM missile costume.  That is actually where the cover image comes from, and Emi does not appear in that outfit during the main movie. The only disappointment is that the 2006 documentary ""The Making of 'Sachiko Hanai'"" isn't included, but otherwise this is good stuff through and through.",1215993600,13,3775,5.27212020033389
8186619,2,B000OT6V2S,"This is basically a porno with a plot. The story is very similar to what a book by Kinky Friedman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Two-Birds-Get-Stoned-A-Novel/dp/0060935286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Two Birds & Get Stoned: A Novel</a>, which has a somewhat related premise) would be like. The movie is a bit boring and too absolved with itself. Quotes are used in every other bit of dialogue and the film kinda tries to convey a message, but it gets lost in the conflicting theories Sachiko keeps ""exploring"" or merely stating.

Plot: Sachiko, a prostitute of sorts, gets shot in the head and miraculously survives. But, her senses are all messed up, she becomes a genius, clairvoyant and starts hallucinating. She ends up with George W. Bush' cloned finger and the story goes on from there. So, the world is in the hands of oversexed, super intelligent Sachiko. Like I said, just like a Kinki Friedman book. The plot was very interesting and had a message thrown in there combined with quotes from Chomsky, Sontag, Descartes, etc.

I did not like the camerawork that much, it was shaky, too dark and it could have been better. Like I mentioned before, this is a porno with a plot, so it is not for the easily offended. Only people that like pink films are likely to enjoy this movie. There is a rape scene that could have been left out of the movie. I found absolutely no value in it and found it unnecessary. It is not like the rape scene in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>"" but a rape scene nonetheless.

DVD: The subtitles that the DVD had left much to be desired. They left many things without translating. I notice there were times where the actors would say something and no subtitles would appear.",1203033600,4,1865,5.315254237288135
