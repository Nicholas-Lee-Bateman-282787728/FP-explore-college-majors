3100714,5,B0012Z36DU,"I had the pleasure of seeing the third Animation Show in a theater last year and loved it. If you're a mature person who enjoys animation at all I highly recommend this DVD and the previous boxed set release of Vol 1 & 2. This is a chance to see a wide variety of animated shorts with different, styles, stories, & moods.
When most people think of animation they think of Looney Tunes type comedies and kids entertainment. The cartoons that are featured on these DVDs will give those people an idea of how varied animated storytelling can get.

Now the ""BUT"" ...
This DVD, like Vol 1 & 2, removes a few shorts that were shown in the theatrical presentation and adds ones that weren't.

This DVD release does not include
""9"" by Shane Acker
""Overtime"" by Oury Atlan, Thibaut Berland and Damien Ferrie
""Eaux Forte (Tidal Wave)"" by Remi Chaye
""Davey and Son of Goliath"" by Corky Quackenbush

Shorts added to the DVD are:
""Astronauts"" by Matthew Walker
""Carlitopolis"" by Nieto
""One D"" by Mike Grimshaw
""Tyger"" by Guilherme Marcondes
""Learn Self Defense"" by Chris Harding
""Abigail"" by Tony Comely
""Shuteye Hotel"" by Bill Plympton

While it's great that they added some new material to the package, it's frustrating that anything was cut out. This is especially frustrating because they cut one of my favorite films in the program, Shane Acker's ""9"". The good news is ""9"" is being developed as a feature length film being released in September of this year, so I'm sure the short will be found on the DVD?/Blu-Ray release next year.

Even without the 4 missing films this is a tremendous value for any animation fan. I'm looking forward to the release of vol 4 (which I missed seeing in a theater, and I hope that they're planning a vol 5 for this fall.",1231113600,10,1746,4.601286173633441
3100715,4,B0012Z36DU,"The Good Things
*Good video/sound quality.
*A very good collection of animated shorts from all over the world in different styles, moods, genres, and mediums.  Each one is distinctive, artistic, and invoking in their own ways.  They're all worthwhile watching.

The Bad Things
*Most shorts are not for kids due to language and violence (and some sexuality in ""Dreams and Desires"").
*The cover is a little misleading.  There are no mutant lobsters or dive-bombing airplanes in any of the shorts (but it is an imaginative cover).

The Other Things
*Presented in fullscreen.  Any widescreen shorts are letterboxed.
*Any shorts in a foreign language have English subtitles.

And here is the list of the short films themselves:
*Beavis and Butthead Introduction; it's short, dumb, and funny.
*""Rabbit,"" which appears to be a computer-animated film with no spoken words, but has words everywhere surrounding stuff.  It's a funky style that's visually interesting.  The story itself (about two kids who discover an idol that spawns jewels and stuff) is morbid and weird, but has a fairy-tale charm to it.
*""City Paradise,"" which appears to have real actors animated in weird ways.  It's a funky artsy film that makes little sense, but is kind of slick.  I couldn't even say what it's about; some Japanese lady moves to a big city and apparently swims to the core of the Earth.
*""Everything Will Be Okay,"" a bleak drama with stick figures, about a man who appears to have a neurological disorder and is about to die.  Its long, but at times funny and emotional.  Very strong themes about death.
*""Collision,"" which is just a very short burst of cool computer-generated stars and stuff.
*""Astronauts,"" a funny computer-generated film about stupid astronauts.
*""Carlitopolis,"" is a French film that shows a live actor experimenting with a seemingly live rat (which has been animated to show cartoonish effects).  It's pretty neat.
*""No Room for Gerold,"" is like a German soap opera, only the people have animal heads.
*""Guide Dog,"" probably my favorite, a cute little film about a dog desperately trying to serve his masters.
*""One D,"" a funny computer-animated film about a world in the first dimention.
*""Tyger,"" a funky combination of CGI and shadow puppets.  It's artistic and cool.  Based on a poem, it shows a gigantic tiger moving through a city, turning everything into a jungle.
*""Versus,"" a French CGI film about two groups of samurai trying to wipe each other out in very funny ways.
*""Learn Self Defense,"" a hilarious lesson in how to fight.
*""Abigail,"" is a strange but artistic short.  It depicts a crashing plane with crazy people inside.
*""Shuteye Hotel,"" is a combination of rough sketchy drawing and CGI.  It's a film-noir thriller about people who die at a hotel.
*""Dreams and Desires,"" a very rough sketchy cartoon about a woman trying to film a wedding.
*""Game Over,"" an awesome stop-motion animated diddy showing old-fashioned computer games (like Pac-Man or Centipede) using various objects and shapes.

As a fan of any form of animation, I was pleased with this collection.  It made me laugh and cry.  I'd gladly reccomend it to anybody looking for good artistic shorts.",1223164800,9,3184,5.015209125475285

8248484,5,B0012Z36DU,"Inevitably any collection of shorts, animated or otherwise will always be a bit of a mixed bag, and this set of 16 animated films, almost all under 10 minutes, is no exception.  But series curators Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeld have made some great choices, and even the least of these films, if less than stellar, show imagination and creativity.  None of them are familiar or by-the-numbers.  And the best are freakin brilliant.

Leading the pack is Hertzfelds own Everything Will Be OK, the longest film in the program.  In 17 minutes of mostly simple stick-figure animation, Hertzfeld takes the black comedy of death, and the sadness and lack of meaning of our day to day lives to make a film that will make you laugh, think, and even be moved.  There are more ideas, laughs and emotion in this quarter of an hour than in the vast majority of full length features.

But there are plenty of highlights here, from the surreal fable Rabbit that opens the program, eerily stealing imagery from Dick and Jane readers to comment on greed, to the wonderfully goofy and funny abstractions of early computer games of Game Over that ends it.  If you like creative and varied animation, this is well worth getting.",1443830400,,1206,4.70952380952381

8248489,2,B0012Z36DU,"I wanted to watch this for quite some time so I decided to finally order it only to be extremely disappointed by the quality and animation choices on this volume. The first one kept me entertained from start to finish with maybe some exceptions but this one doesn't even come close to the experience I had with the first volume. In fact, I have only watched a couple of these shorts because the content is not as fascinating as I would expect it to be.",1407974400,,452,4.329411764705882
8248490,5,B0012Z36DU,"The Animation Show is back and just as good as ever! The mix of work here, both in terms of animation style and tone of the content is extraordinary. I have a personal soft spot for this volume of work because I was able to attend a screening in a theater of this particular line up. Without a doubt ""Everything Will Be OK"" is the stand out here but there isn't anything dull here.

8248492,3,B0012Z36DU,As a stand alone release I would  say its a great addition to any animation lovers collection. But it really doesn't compare to the first two volumes IMO. I felt some of the selections here were rather gimmicky. Kinda neat to look at but little substance. Also I would add theres alot of experimental and CGI animation going on here so people who love old school animation and stop motion will likely be a bit disappointed.,1283299200,3,423,4.565789473684211
