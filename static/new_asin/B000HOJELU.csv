8140741,3,B000HOJELU,"Had this actually taken place, the kid would have been molested by more than the prison guard/interrogator. Cellmates would have been all over him out of horniness. Believeable acting and atmosphere were a plus.",1375228800,,211,5.235294117647059
8140742,5,B000HOJELU,"This film gives us a view of Russian life that we've heard about. But we couldn't comprehend the impact it would have on it's citizens, especially the vulnerable ones.
The boy was abandoned by his mother and he sets out to find his father in the gulag system somewhere out in the remote region of Russia. His encounters within the juvenile system, the police while on the run, and the citizens he meets during his trip truly drips of Russian soul. Once he finds his father, he learns about his father's life as a child and how he landed in the adult prison system.
Purchase this movie along with 'Lessons at the End of Spring' and 'Greenhouse Effect'. You'll get the full breath of Russian life during the Berlin Wall era.",1207872000,6,722,4.519083969465649

(USSR, 1989) Director: Sergi Bodrov, Sr. Cast: Volodya Kozyrev, Alexander Bureyev, Svetlana Gaitan, Vitaulus Tomkus. Color. In Russian with English subtitles. Running time: 75 minutes. Unrated.

Inspired by true events, FREEDOM IS PARADISE is the harrowing tale of a fiercely independent orphan and his quest for the father he has never known. The first Russian motion picture ever filmed in actual Soviet prisons and reformatories, FREEDOM IS PARADISE combines a gritty documentary style with poetic lyricism. A riveting journey through the dark underside of the Soviet working class and institutional life, FREEDOM IS PARADISE captures a boy's fierce capacity to dream amidst the boldfaced cruelty of circumstance. This Grand Prize winner at the 1989 Montreal Film Festival addresses with quiet eloquence the sad irony of children dwelling on the margin. Contains nudity, harsh language, and mature themes.",1155859200,,929,5.628571428571429
