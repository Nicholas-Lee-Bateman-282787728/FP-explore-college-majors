8149705,4,B000JBXHJQ,Used this with 2nd graders studying Atlantis.  They loved it.  I thought it was often over their heads. Lots of interesting background.,1360886400,2,135,5.090909090909091
8149706,2,B000JBXHJQ,"This documentary is good, interesting but you won't learn anything new. It's the ""basic stuff"", things you can easily find on the internet or that I have seen in other documentaries. In a way this documentary is only a recent version of the ""In Search Of..."" episode of the 70's, so nothing new.",1309392000,9,295,4.584905660377358
