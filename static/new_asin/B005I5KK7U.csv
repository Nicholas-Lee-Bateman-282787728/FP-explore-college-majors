4708276,5,B005I5KK7U,"This is one of my favorite Cantinflas films.  It tells the story of a small-town doctor who, wanting to become current in the latest medical techniques, returns to medical school in Mexico City.  While there, he challenges the norms of current medical practice, particularly the tendency to treat patients as a number rather than as a human-being.  This results in constant conflict with his superiors, especially Dr. Villanueva.  To make matters worse, Cantinflas has his eyes on Dr. Villanueva's sister, who is a nurse at the hospital. The typical comical exchanges that characterize all of the Cantinflas movies are present in this film, although the plot is of a more serious nature than many of his other films.  For example, during one exchange, Dr. Villanueva asks Cantinflas what he knows about ""los rayos catodicos"" (x-rays) and Cantinflas misinterprets the question and begins to narrate the history of the ""los reyes catolicos.""  (catholic kings of Spain) An underlying theme of the movie is that the human element is the most crucial factor in the healing process.  Cantinflas succeeds in making you laugh while at the same time highlighting the importance of the 'human factor' as an integral part of the healing process.  This theme comes out in his interaction with a boy that is a patient at the hospital, having been diagnosed with a brain tumor.  Ultimately, Cantinflas goes against the protocol of the hospital and decides to operate on the boy to remove the tumor without the father's permission, ultimately saving the boy's life.",1384992000,2,1550,5.070866141732283
4708277,3,B005I5KK7U,"In this movie Cantinflas is more serious than in his other works. His comical style is off, for instance his signiture walk. I don't know if he did this on purpose or if maybe it's because it's one of his last movies. I don't like not having SUBTITLES. Normally you can miss alot of his dialogue because he speaks so rapidly and everything he says is funny. He didn't do much of that style of talking either in this movie though. I've decided not to buy any more movies by this company because they don't have subtitles.",1369699200,2,520,4.371134020618556
