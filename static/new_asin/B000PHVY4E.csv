2822331,1,B000PHVY4E,I thought Turista was bad - how wrong I was b/c Brutal is even worse.  The movie is slow and I've forgotten what a bad B movie is like.  Don't bother with the movie and don't consider it a rental.,1184198400,5,196,3.875
2822332,2,B000PHVY4E,"Brutal is quite possibly one of the worst slasher movies out there, mainly because for most of its running time it forgets that it's a dumb slasher movie. It takes itself too seriously and focuses too much of its time on an adulterous couple, and on shoddy detective work.
B-movie legends Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes; The Devils Rejects) both star, but they turn in disappointing performances. Perhaps its because both of their characters are so badly written.
However, Brutal does have a few bloody good deaths, and I've seen worse. So I'm going to be nice and give it two stars.",1184198400,10,622,4.822429906542056

8191396,4,B000PHVY4E,"First off, even though this film certainly isn't ""Hostel"" it's still actually quite good. To be honest, it doesn't really fall solidly into the horror genre. It's really more of a horror-drama, if such a thing can be said to exist (not a bad concept if you ask me). Without too many spoilers, the story centers on the life of a young police woman who has experienced her number of personal difficulties already when the story begins. The villain is certainly fairly believable from a more realistic perspective (not the frothing, red eyed monster some were hoping for) but certainly no less vicious or frightening. Some times real life can be scarier than anything in the movies. That being said, throughout the story we watch the young woman go through the process of becoming a stronger, far happier human being. To me, that is worth the price of the movie. Of course, if all you are looking for is simply a blood spattered gore-fest, admittedly, this film may leave you wanting. I would actually recommend this film to female fans of horror because it does not patronize, belittle or stereotype the heroine. She is shown as capable, intelligent, sensitive and truly courageous. By the end of the film, she faces her personal difficulties with poise, bravery and compassion. In fact, it was such a unique experience that I gave the film an extra star. Say what you will, this is not a bad movie (albeit perhaps before a more openminded audience).",1354665600,,1448,4.772908366533865
8191397,1,B000PHVY4E,"I received this movie as a gift, I had never heard of it before but as Jeffery Combs was in it, I hoped it would be good. Sadly what I ended up seeing was a poorly written, acted, and directed mess of a film that not even the great Mr. Combs could fix. The plot is obvious, a serial killer is on the loose and only the local police can stop him, but that's not important as I found myself distracted constantly by little things.
For example, there is a scene after a body is discovered where a police woman is being hit on by a reporter, this is so wildly inappropriate, yet they handle it like he's hitting on her at a luncheon with friends. I was so taken aback by this I didn't even notice the decent effects for the dead body and gore.
The worst part about this movie is how everyone just seems to be phoning in their roles, no one really cares and you never start to care about the characters.
I'm glad this was a gift, because paying even one dollar for this would be way too much.",1304294400,,987,4.092783505154639
8191398,2,B000PHVY4E,"Pretty much mindless repeats of the old standards.. only one woman with an iq above 30, archtypical men, lame responses to danger, lackadaisical performances.... for it's type it's ok .. only the thinest plot to glue a series of grusome events (poorly depicted and poorly shot for slash films) together and flash a bit of T&A along the way.... you could pass 90 minutes on this but you probably have something better to do. As a movie I'd rank it a 1 star, but as a slash film its probably a 3 so I average it out to a weak 2.",1288051200,,526,4.217821782178218
8191399,4,B000PHVY4E,"I watched it mainly for Sarah Thompson, who I just love. The film itself isn't that bad, it has some questionable moments. The murders were brutal so that was nice.

The relationship with the officers seems random and more of a soap opera plot than a movie, but that just means we get to see more of Sarah so Im ok with it.

Trust me Ive sene over 500 films, over 100 horror and this one is not the worse or even on my top 50 worse horror films.",1287446400,,445,3.9887640449438204
8191400,1,B000PHVY4E,"Brutal (Ethan Wiley, 2007)

Wiley (House II) wrote, produced, and directed this straight-to-video standard slasher schlock that's only notable for its surprisingly fine cast. Jeffrey Combs (ReAnimator) plays Jimmy Fleck, a small-town sheriff who's married to the local councilman's daughter but getting some on the side with his hot deputy Zoe (Sarah Thomson of Cruel Intentions II). When a serial killer starts operating in the town, Jimmy seems less than concerned about things, and his half-hearted efforts to find the killer lead Zoe to Leroy Calhoun (The Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman, one of America's more underrated talents), an autistic man who raises bloodhounds. Can Zoe uncover the killer's identity before he gets around to killing her (because, after all, small towns have a finite supply of nubile young women)?

It's stupid, but unintentionally funny in a number of places, and any chance one gets to see Michael Berryman on the screen should be eagerly accepted. (Thankfully, his career is in the middle of a renaissance right now thanks to The Devil's Rejects, and I couldn't be happier.) But the real prize here is Jeffrey Combs, who for what seems like the first time isn't in a role where he's parodying Herbert West. Hey, the guy can actually do something else! Honest to Pete!

Still, though, if Combs, Berryman, and a seemingly endless parade of hot chicks isn't enough to keep you interested, then pass on this one. The plot is cookie-cutter, the script boneheaded, the direction uninspired. There are actually Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies you'll have more fun with, and that's saying something. * ",1227052800,,1629,5.1358490566037736
8191401,2,B000PHVY4E,"This movie was just ok.not the best and deffinatly not jeffery combs at his best but ive seen worse.the was a few good and creative killings and some gore but not much,lots of blood though.the plot was really paper thin but passible.as a whole the movie couldve been better.worth a rent but i only paid $0.15 for it so i cant complain.dont buy for anymore then $5.like i said not the best but you could be watching alot worse like turistas(horrible).the sound on this dvd is a mixed bag where the talking is kinda low but the music and sfx are loud,although this leads to a few cheap scares that will force some people to jump because of the loud ness of the sfx.watch at your own risk.",1225152000,,686,4.3671875
8191402,1,B000PHVY4E,"This movie sucks. Hands down. Good lord, I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie by any leap of the imagination, but even for b-movie cannon fodder, it sucked harshly and long.

First of all, the female lead had to play the stupidest law enforcement agent in the history of mankind. I swear, there is literally a scene where she hears a noise in bushes around her house (at night no less!) and instead of drawing her weapon, stupid creeps around in the dark with no light saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" I know movies require suspension of disbelief, and I certainly wouldn't expect her to go blasting away at the bushes like John McClain on a four shot espresso bender, but come on. Seriously.

And she was absolutely useless. She had to be bailed out of ever bad situation by all the men in the movie. And yes, it does prick my feminist side deeply, I'll admit that first up, but she's supposed to be a police officer. Looking cute in your uniform is not all it takes to be a good cop.

Not to mention the whole 'serial killer' angle was a complete wash-out. I've seen highschoolers write more compelling scripts that weren't half as trite or cliched. This movie was the fuzz that grows on crap after its been left out in the pasture after a hard rain. Don't waste your time.",1224806400,,1280,4.415254237288136
8191403,1,B000PHVY4E,I fell asleep before my dog got the chance.  This one is really brutal...no pun intended...no acting...no script...no way!  The best of this film was my fast forward and stop buttons.,1205020800,,183,4.870967741935484
8191404,3,B000PHVY4E,I found the performances by Jeffry Combes and Michael Berryman to be quite refreshing and unlike their previous roles. The plot and other acting did leave something to be desired. I liked the whole flower/garden tool motif for for a slasher-like film amusing.,1200614400,,259,5.046511627906977
