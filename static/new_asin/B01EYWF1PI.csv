8759810,5,B01EYWF1PI,"Love this story! It is action/adventure, romance, and comedy rolled into a fast-paced series. A military based series was different from the normal Korean drama but the actors were perfectly matched to their roles and seldom were guilty of ""overacting."" The Korean actors displayed subtle facial expressions at the appropriate times which are a tribute to their superb acting skills. The non-Korean actors were well-chosen, too. The English translation was excellent. It differed slightly from the translation in the Hulu version but it was easy to follow and understand. I highly recommend this series.",1472947200,,603,5.425531914893617
8759811,5,B01EYWF1PI,"You need two attributes to get into this: 1) the ability to play DVD's in region 3 and 2) an enjoyment of foreign films whose dialog you are only going to get through subtitles.

Having both those attributes I highly recommend this series.  The Malaysian source proved to be quite reliable.  The series combines a romance novel an action film and a social commentary.  I found the long close ups of faces staring longingly at a loved one to be overdone but the woman I watched the series with did not.  For me, the real achievement of this series is the non-intrusive placements of many socio-political issues within the episodes:  the North/South Korea conflict.  the divide between commissioned and non-commissioned officers, the value of medicine or the military as a career for social good, the value of following orders versus doing what is right, the perspective of bureaucrats versus those who do the work, romantic relationships that span ideological or social differences, the value of the military for uplifting what might otherwise be the dregs of society, American willingness to put up with bad things to achieve national objectives, and no doubt more issues that I am not remembering or have missed.",1467244800,,1213,4.975247524752476
8759812,3,B01EYWF1PI,"First off, I would like to say that the shipping was fast. Expected arrival was about 3-4 weeks but it came 7 days after I ordered it so I was happy. I LOVE this show. Like super crazy in love. It was so well written and you fall in love with the characters. I endured watching it online with commercials and the constant freezing. I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could watch it interruption free. I was soo disappointed when I put the first disk and 1) it has some weird logo at the top right hand corner and it stays there which is annoying, and 2) the quality is awful! It looks like the camera is constantly shaking (I def know it wasn't as it did not do this online). They are more like super mini glitches and it does it through out the whole damn first episode. I didn't check to see if it improved in the others. I was too mad. I'm hoping this isn't the only version and that perhaps a better quality one will come out that will also include the Epilogue. This one only has Episodes 1-16. There are 17 online. No wonder why this was only around $30. I thought that was such an amazing price for such a newly released popular show.",1462752000,7,1153,4.106194690265487
