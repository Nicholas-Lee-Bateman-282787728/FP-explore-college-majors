7020554,1,B00TQGGJNQ,Not a complete film. It ends in the middle.  Could have been good if they'd gone all the way to the end of the story.,1427241600,6,117,3.68
7020555,1,B00TQGGJNQ,"Bad, terrible! From the bad, ridiculously modern haircut on the main character to the poor writing, this movie just makes you wish you were doing something else, like reading a book on the real Vikings or washing the dishes. If you are the kind of person whose interest in Norse history extends beyond getting a pseudo-Viking tattoo and wearing a Minnesota Vikings t-shirt, stay away. This is not only a waste of your time, but it is an insult to your intelligence.",1448064000,,465,4.682926829268292

7020561,4,B00TQGGJNQ,"Watched it twice. First time was good, but I needed a second viewing to appreciate it. It isn't my general type of movie, being all violence and death (and obviously vengeance), but I'd watch it again :)",1442361600,,203,4.513513513513513
7020562,2,B00TQGGJNQ,Poor acting and lousy fight scenes,1441584000,,34,4.833333333333333
7020563,2,B00TQGGJNQ,Not happy with it. If you are just looking for something to have playing on the TV while you do something else fine.........,1441152000,,124,4.434782608695652

7020565,1,B00TQGGJNQ,"Very possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence. I can see a violence obsessed teen zeroing in on it. It purports to be a story about the Norman Invasion of 1066. The only things it had right were horses and ..... well, horses.",1438387200,,265,4.428571428571429
7020566,1,B00TQGGJNQ,"One starbut . . .

Not for Americansbut if your English, not clinically anti-social, and genuinely interested in Anglo-Saxon 'dark ages' themes of kidnapping and violence, then you may see some purpose in this Blu-ray. Violent, and far less dialogue than typical. Almost scholarly and academic Anglo-Saxon studies for wanton nature.",1438300800,,332,5.509803921568627
7020567,4,B00TQGGJNQ,"Here's an interesting version of the champion of oppressed.  Set in the Middle Ages, a stranger comes to the aid of the Saxons who had been long plagued by Lord Dyrant.  As he offers to spare the life if one of the Lord's, sons, Romain, he gives the man an option, ""An eye for your life"".  Later the stranger tells the same man, ""Tell your father (Durant) the Gods can no longer wait.""

Yes, the colors are muted and it's muddy and messy, but it's a fun movie to watch.  It does have a nice feel to the story.  By the time you figured out who the central character is, the movie has made it to the final push.  It's definitely worth waiting for.",1438300800,7,645,4.153225806451613
7020568,3,B00TQGGJNQ,Entertaining.  Not the greatest plot.,1438041600,,37,6.4

7020570,3,B00TQGGJNQ,Anakin was pretty good in this one but would have been better if Nicolas Cage had acted better.,1437264000,,95,4.333333333333333
7020571,5,B00TQGGJNQ,"love it. I've been wondering where this actor disappeared to after his work with Patrick Swayze. Forgot the name of the series. In this he has done amazing work, and so has the rest of the cast. They are all exceptional.

7020574,5,B00TQGGJNQ,Even though the movive is mostly black and white because of the snow and rock setting the story is great. The acting is very good. The plot of the story is great and throuws a very good twist in it. I would recommemd renting it.,1435017600,9,228,4.088888888888889
7020575,1,B00TQGGJNQ,"I don't do Sepia films or Blue tinted films or Green tinted Films. The history for all of them is they failed miserably at the box office no mater who they were starring.

7020576,5,B00TQGGJNQ,Loved the movie.,1433548800,,16,4.666666666666667
7020577,4,B00TQGGJNQ,"Yes you have seen this plot before.  Evil ruler is oppressing the people and mysterious stranger sets out to take them down by rousing the people to fight with him.  However, this film takes that and adds a few twists, mostly fairly well done action and an interesting cinematography and for the most part makes it work.
Yes there were a few parts of the plot I laughed at along with the low budget feel of the film.  It took a few minutes to get used to the almost complete desaturation of color in the film, but it does seem to give it a middle age look of dirt and despair.
Is this film going to win awards, of course not.  Is it worth the $10 that it was on release for a good few viewings of fun... absolutely!",1432857600,13,715,4.122302158273381

7020584,2,B00TQGGJNQ,"""The God's can no longer wait."" When an evil ruler begins to oppress the land the is only one man that can fight back and restore peace. The fighter they find only wants one thing...blood. This is a hard movie to review. First of all, this is not really my type of movie. I have never been a big fan of the mid-evil genre and wasn't a huge fan of Hammer of the Gods so I wasn't really expecting much from this. All that said there was one thing that was really distracting and hard to get past. In the movie 300, during the fight scenes the camera slows down and speeds up so much that it takes you out of the movie. In this movie, they slow down the fighting...but never speed it back up. This may seem like a little thing but when it's overused it becomes far too distracting for you to focus on what is happening in the movie. I do have to say that although the movie seemed pretty low budget, the use of the sepia-like filter made it seem like the movie has made for more than it was. Overall, if you liked Hammer of the Gods you will most likely like this one as well. As for me, the technical issues were too much for me to get past. I give this a C.",1429574400,3,1156,4.008658008658009

8702855,2,B00TQGGJNQ,"Slow at times, atmospheric, and violent, this is nothing more
than one more brutal sword fighting movie, one that people that
like this kind of movies will enjoy.
The plot is pretty basic and retold so many times.
The acting is barbaric enough to make the movie even more relevant.

Watch it if you like these kind of movies but do not expect to watch something
you have not watched before",1474329600,,389,4.47887323943662
