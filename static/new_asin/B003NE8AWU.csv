8400881,5,B003NE8AWU,"I'm a big fan of UGK and I own all the dvds they have out.  It's about 5 or 6 of them.  THis one is the most in depth I fell, the most personal.  If you're a fan like me and you want to view some real history, it's well worth the buy.",1323129600,,234,3.3773584905660377
8400882,5,B003NE8AWU,I thought this DVD was just going to be clips from previously released footage.  There is old material as well as new material.  The sound is better on this dvd than earlier UGK documentaries. It was also well put together.  I was impressed and completely satisfied with the purchase.,1282003200,2,284,4.755102040816326
