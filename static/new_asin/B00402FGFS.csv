Disappointing to my kids for the quality of the entire film...we made it through 20 minutes of the film and have no desire to finish it.  The remainder of the films are good.  Overall, worth the price to get some nice Christmas movies not frequently offered through live tv.",1482105600,,416,4.506666666666667
8411574,4,B00402FGFS,"This collection runs the gamut from not so good to very very good (hard to expect anything else from a collection with six titles). But its bargain-basement price point makes it a steal for anyone who loves Christmas fare, so the sum of the whole is greater than its individual parts. Production by production:

""An All Dogs Christmas Carol."" The first word that comes to mind is ""bizarre."" Evil demon dogs, ghostly magic whistles, a nonsensical plot and Charles Nelson Reilly. I have a feeling that whomever wrote the script leaves it off his or her resume. For the matter, so do the animators. Feels less like Christmas than it does Halloween. Two stars.

""Christmas Carol: The Movie."" An interesting effort at retelling this story for the billionth time, focusing more on Scrooge's relationship with Belle than some of the other aspects. Scrooge is a major a-hole to everybody except, inexplicably, two little mice to whom he is quite affectionate. Although I'm not sure why, because they are incredibly annoying with the squeaking. Three stars.

""A Pink Christmas."" The best of the lot with wonderful animation and songs, although quite sad (but ultimately with a good message) because PP can't find food. This was made in the late '70s and it's unfortunate that nobody makes stuff like this anymore. This actually is a three-fer, as two other non-Christmas PP episodes are included. Four stars.

""Babes in Toyland."" Like the original, has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas even though some people want to make it into a Christmas thing because it involves toys. Some kids mike like it but I found it to be horribly unwatchable. And Charles Nelson Reilly. One star.

""Prancer."" A nice inclusion. Little girl nurses a hurt reindeer back to health and he returns her affections. Decent movie with Sam Elliott as the father. Thank goodness he never says ""Reindeer: It's what's for dinner."" A shaky three stars.

""Blizzard."" Two stories within a story within a story, this one went all over the map. A movie made for 8 year olds really shouldn't have this many plotlines. In the first 30 minutes I had major trouble figuring out what was supposed to be going on. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see ""Blizzard"" eventually find its footing (actually in the movie, it would be ""her"" footing) and turn into a very watchable film. The production values are first-rate and even though it took what seemed like forever to get into one linear direction, I'd recommend it for occasional viewing. A strong three stars.",1355184000,7,2521,4.892271662763466
8411575,4,B00402FGFS,"I have not viewed these movies. So my review is about the discrepancy between the product details and what I actually got. There are six movies advertised as being on six disks. However, there are only three disks in the package.",1323216000,4,229,4.609756097560975
