5070448,2,B0079ZWU5W,"""My father once told me to be careful of the things you love most in the world because if your not careful that very thing can also destroy you.""  Nine years after being attacked and nearly killed by a shark professional diver Kate (Berry) is ready to give tours again, just not to swim outside of a cage. After a financial crises forces her to help a man live his dream of swimming with the sharks she is forced to confront her fears again. This is a movie that hardcore fans of shark movies will enjoy. For me it was very slow and pretty boring. I think the problems with this one are pretty much even across the board. I felt no connection with any of the characters, the movie was longer then it needed to be and this is the type of movie you forget as you are watching. You may see it different but to me this is boring and forgettable. Overall, unless this is your favorite type of movie you may feel the same as I did. I give it a C.",1331769600,14,940,4.081081081081081

For one, anyone with half a brain would have seen well before they went into the water for that final climax shark swim, that there was a bad storm rolling in. They would have known better than to not head home before the sky and sea got nasty. That alone destroyed this film as it seemed as though the screenplay could only have been written by someone who has little to no knowledge or even common sense about the subject they were centering the story around. .... Too bad, because it could have been done a lot better than it was. The basic premise of the story was a good one, just poorly put together.",1414627200,,636,4.264462809917355

The story line and characters were all interesting and the footage of the great whites is amazing.

Halle Berry was fantastic and her co stars were as well.

5070509,3,B0079ZWU5W,"The combination of now husband and wife team, Halle Berry and the always sexy Olivier Martinez, was the clincher to draw my interest in this relatively unknown thriller, ""Dark Tide"". For me, this is one of the classic beautiful couples like Diana Ross/Billy Dee Williams, Clark Gable/Carole Lombard, etc. Unfortunately, their romantic interaction is limited to passive/aggressive romantic dialogue.
It certainly maintained my interest enough that I watched it in 3 parts on my iPad. I never knew you could interact so intimately with sharks, with professional guidance of course. The movie underscores, once again, mythical fear of human fear. Not to say, I would ever even contemplate trying.
I longed for one passionate kiss between the newly weds, but, their chemistry was undeniable. I assume this is the movie set where they fell in love.
The secondary storyline of fractured parent/sibling relationship is compelling and could have been explored deeper. The film's small cast are all quite good.",1396742400,,1001,5.30188679245283

5070514,3,B0079ZWU5W,I only watched this to see the shark footage.  Some of it was filmed at Isla Guadalupe and there was a shark in the movie that I saw with my own eyes while cage diving.  Great footage!,1393718400,,184,3.945945945945946
5070515,4,B0079ZWU5W,"Halle Berry takes a big leap from ghetto girl in B.A.P.S. to shark diver in DARK TIDE.  Many movie critics and Amazon commenters have slammed Halle and this movie, but had the hero been Harrison Ford, George Clooney, or Matt Damon it would have gotten rave reviews I'm sure.

A colored girl still has a hard way to go in Hollywood.  It is amazing that Berry can still make movies considering all her box office flops in the last 10 years or so. It is also amazing how good she looks for a woman pushing fifty with no visible signs of plastic surgery.  Her face and figure are picture perfect...and that's good enough for me!",1390521600,,624,4.4
5070516,1,B0079ZWU5W,"I completely agree with the reviewer that also noticed the serious ""lack of chemistry"" between the main characters.

It is a horrible ""bad shark movie"" that I just had to own on blu-ray because I love the gorgeous underwater cinematography in this movie, but I watch it with the sound turned off so I don't have to listen to the dialogue. And it is the best of the ""bad shark movies"" for real fear factor largely because they use real sharks and a surprising amount of footage of people diving with real sharks. We've learned so much about the Great White since Jaws, and the fact that this footage exists is proof of it. The story... Who cares. The acting... All of these people can do better.  Watch this for the shark footage. Nuff said.",1389139200,2,661,4.288

5070533,2,B0079ZWU5W,"Dark Tide (2012) was directed by John Stockwell (Top Gun, Blue Crush) and stars the incredibly lovely Halle Berry.

A marine biologist, Kate Mathieson (Berry), goes from being the ""shark whisperer"" to a tour boat operator after a shark misbehaves badly during the filming of a documentary. As Kate's business struggles and the bank prepares to seize her boat her estranged husband (Olivier Martinez) comes to the rescue with a money-making proposition; an English fat-cat offers to pay dearly for an opportunity for him and his son to swim with the sharks. Kate reluctantly agrees but the sharks aren't willing to play nice.

Other than gorgeous Halle Berry and the gorgeous South African coastal scenery there's very little to recommend about Dark Tide. I kept glancing at the minutes counter to see when the torture would end. Watch it if you must but at the end of this straight-to-video flick you'll ponder how to get back the two hours of your life you just wasted.",1374969600,,970,4.872727272727273
5070534,1,B0079ZWU5W,"A beautiful, academy award winning actress.  A sexy French film star made famous in The Horseman on the Roof.  Beautiful South African scenery - what could go wrong?!  Um -  just about everything!
Let's start with Halle and Olivier.  This movie is supposedly where the now married couple met and fell in love - hard to believe as there is zero chemistry between them!  Olivier looks like he needs to give up smoking immediately - and Halle has a 5 oclock shadow in most of the scenes?  Maybe after paying the actor's salaries there wasn't any money left over for a make up artist but seriously- two of the best looking people on the planet and either they look like crap or they are wearing goofy deep sea diving masks with enormous flippers!
Next the story - Halle is supposed to be some famous Shark Whisperer who free dives and then cozies up to great whites by reading their body language and not making any bubbles - ridiculous!  All the scary moments are telegraphed so far in advance I was almost screaming ""just attack them already"" to the menacing sharks!  I think the audience is supposed to feel some sort of remorse or sadness when the bad things go down but really it is just a relief as it meant the movie was nearing the end!
You would be better of going to the local aquarium to view live sharks swim around their tanks for a couple of hours than spending any time on this mistake of a film - don't waste your time on this one!",1374883200,8,1443,4.3745318352059925

The movie was worth watching once, but prob not a movie I would watch again.

HB looks great as usual. The 'scenery' was quite nice. Love the fact they used REAL GREAT WHITES & not some weird fake looking sharks & we see plenty of them. The best part was seeing the real great whites 'breaching' (flying up out of the water & in to the air while hunting their prey).

But the movie itself was just sort of bla.

So, I gave it 3 stars in trying to be halfway fair. It wasn't horrible & was worth a single viewing & I listed the 'good' above, but again, aside from what I listed it was just bla so it garners 3 stars from me...2 may be a tad too low considering it did have some good stuff but 4 stars would be saying this was 'better then average', which in my opinion, it was not.",1349136000,,898,3.9447513812154695

First of all, the shark footage is fantastic!  It's just beautiful!

Second of all, the movie has good action and tension throughout without making it gruesome!

Thirdly, Halle Berry does a decent acting job, as does everyone else, but  Olivier Martinez.  Now, I am NOT a Halle Berry fan at all!  I think she is a poor actress and think her acting in all her movies have pulled the movies down.  The only exception to that was ""Monster Ball"".  That movie was written well enough that even her poor acting counldn't bring it down.  But I think she does a good job in this movie.

Olivier Martinez, however, has no acting range!  You can really see the difference in his and Halle Berry's performance in the last scenes where they are in the rescue boat.  She looks gaunt and her expression is one of sickness and strain.  He looks like he just walked out of his hotel room.  He has no facial expression.
But he doesn't bring the movie down.

After tragedy strikes, she stops taking tourists shark diving and her business starts failing. When she gets an offer to return to what she used to love, will she take it?

I viewed this film because I haven't watched a movie with Halle Berry in a while. There are educational moments, so I now know some things about sharks I didn't know before. I liked that there were subtitles - that made the film more interesting somehow. Some parts were predictable, some parts made me flinch and there were times when I turned my eyes away.

5070561,2,B0079ZWU5W,"This movie isn't that good at all, but it's not the worse thing I have seen. The shots of the sharks are done very well and I love seeing real sharks in the water and NOT fake puppets or CGI sharks.

I love the story itself, except for a few things. I don't get this one scene in the middle of the movie. There are a few people that go diving underwater at the middle of the night. They are looking for oysters and they find them. But later, a person gets eating by a shark. I don't see why that scene was needed at all. We already know sharks are killing people. This was shown from the begining of the movie, so that scene wasn't needed at all.

Another thing I didn't like about the movie was when the picture would get too dark to see. At the end of the movie is the worse, you can't tell who is who. It's so dark that you can barely make out water a objects, but you don't know if that's a person or something else. When someone gets biten, you don't know who it was until they say who it was. When they go underwater, you really don't know who is who. They are all are wearing the same thing and you can't really tell by seeing just their eyeballs with their masks on in a total dark picture.

People should not buy this movie at all, maybe just rent, if you want to see real sharks and Halle.",1343865600,3,1299,4.007722007722008
5070562,2,B0079ZWU5W,"I tried to figure out what is the point of the movie, and I came to the conclusion that some of the actors/producers needed the money really bad and decided to quickly make a movie. They recruited Halle Berry, made sure that she spends 3/4 of the time in a bikini, and some good actors (name recognition) who really didn't try very hard. When you see Halle Berry on the cover in a bikini (same most of the time; need more variety, maybe need to consult with Sports Illustrated), one must anticipate good acting too (i.e. Monster's Ball). Well, this is not the case for Berry, and definitely not the case for the rest of the cast.

Halle plays somebody who talks/lives with the sharks, and makes movies (documentaries) until a shark eats her best friend/mentor (beautiful shark attack at the beginning of the movie, probably the best scene of the movie, makes you jump out of your seat). After that she quits working for National Geographic and tries to do tourist tours but it doesn't work. And we are in for a boring 20-40 minutes.

Then a rich ahole (...aren't they all according to the rich people in Hollywood who know everything?) with his son arrives in his private plane (..and he smokes too..., he definitely deserves to die!) and wants to touch the sharks too. At this point everybody is fighting on the boat and I could have told you who are the people who are going to die and get eaten by the sharks one hour into the movie. They are going to fish in Shark Alley territory (ouuuh!). But we have to wait all the way to the end to see the predictable ending.

Quick question for the director/producers: When you have a boat that cannot stir and is speeding towards the rocks, don't you think that it would make sense to cut the engine, and try to fix it, instead of panicking and trying desperately to fix the engine that leaks oil (while it is running and speeding towards the rocks), with a pair of pliers? Just thinking out loud. I know that somehow they must end in the water with the big sharks to end the movie, but please make un effort, don't assume everybody is ignorant! Just pay attention to the details. With Halle Berry and the price you are charging that was not supposed to be a B/C movie.

And throughout the movie we have Olivier Martinez speaking with a totally fake pathetic French accent.

Two stars for the beautiful shots of South Africa that really makes you want to go there and play with the sharks too (in a cage)! Since this movie is not going to be blockbuster, maybe this movie should be given to the officials dealing with tourism in South Africa to promote their beautiful country. At least that will be useful.",1343260800,5,2652,4.471074380165289

This movie is quite a different role for Halle. It's interesting because it's about swimming with one of the most dangerous creatures of the deep blue sea, that being the shark.

The filming was really great. To me, everything looked realistic. It's not one of those action movies with the high speed chases, but in it's own way, there is thrilling action with Halle and her crew's encounter with the shark.

The movie is not a non-stop action thriller movie, but none-the-less, it will keep you engrossed while watching the different scenes, especially the ocean scenes with the shark.

I would definitely recommend this movie, especially if you're like me, a Halle Berry fan.

For what it's worth, Halle Berry plays a Shark Tourism expert who apparently can tame the sharks, roll onto their backs, and make them go into a trance.  This is a concept I completely understand since Berry can do this to human males as well.  I digress.  After a whispering hiatus - the result of a mishap when one of her aquatic pals got confused with the homonym ""chum"" - she returns to the South African waters thanks to a wealthy, arrogant businessman and his pansy son.  Of course they didn't get along.  And since it was so obviously foreshadowed, there is no real spoiler in mentioning one of them should have been credited in the movie as ""Shark Fodder.""  Seas rage, storms wail, sharks circle menacingly, insert a bit of drama and a poorly conceived romantic angle about as endearing as a tree-top stalker with KY and binoculars, and the result is utterly predictable.  Special shout-out to the atrocious writing that reduced an Academy Award winner into perhaps the worst delivery of her career.

Ultimately this movie fails to live up to the shark predecessor (Leading Lady: Alba vs. Berry=tie, Romantic Counterpart: Walker>Martinez, Third wheel with little man syndrome: Caan>Ralph).

At least the lighting in Into the Blue was professionally done, and enough of Alba's derriere was shown that it was censored in some countries (warning: the lighting in this movie is horrible through most of the climax and a few other scenes).

Halle Berry loses a friend/mentor in a shark attack. She blames herself for his death and doesn't go back to shark studying because of it. Her estanged husband, who's also the photographer at the attack, wants to get back with her plus continue the business. An obnoxious, but wealthy businessman hires them so he can swim with sharks with his son. His son doesn't really want to be there, but wants to be there before his dying father dies. Dad apparently has somewhat of a deathwish since he already knows he's dying.

The initial dive isn't that successful and dad wants way more action with much bigger sharks. Halle Berry's character finally angrily agrees, taking them out into much more dangerous waters where the Great White Sharks dwell. One or two predictable things happen, and they find themselves sinking and fighting for their lives in very choppy waters. The ending is again pretty predictable, and I'm not exactly sure what was accomplished.

Great shark footage here and decent on water and underwater cinematography
here. Halle look great as usual. Acting was good, but I found myself not really caring for anyone in the cast. Just an overall obnoxious bunch of people.

I'm not going to tell you Dark Tide is the best shark movie you could rent, but it's not terrible. After all, it was filmed in False Bay, Cape Town, South Africa, and shot for six weeks on a small boat with real great white sharks.
Kate Mathieson (Halle Berry) is known as a type of ""shark whisperer."" She used to swim with great whites until the tragic death of her mentor. Blaming herself and her old partner and husband, Jeff (Olivier Martinez), she watches as her boating business begins to dry up. People want to see sharks not dolphins and other marine mammals.
Kate used to have this philosophy, ""You're told your whole life that sharks are dangerous. And then finally you're under water and you see the very thing you were taught to fear. And it's perfect. My father once told me to be careful of the things we love most in the world. Because if you're not careful, that very thing can also destroy you.""
Her husband reminds her of how she used to think, and approaches her with the challenge -- a thrill-seeking millionaire wants to swim with the great whites. With debt mounting, and no other way out, she eventually gives in.
Some of the footage is amazing.
""I touched a real shark, like a real great white shark in the wild,"" Halle said.  ""When I went to go touch the shark they had me tethered to the boat, and I finally said, `Wait a second, why am I tied to the boat?' And they said, 'Well if the shark gets you, we want them to just get your arm and not your whole body.'""",1336521600,,1545,4.342560553633218

5070578,2,B0079ZWU5W,"WARNING: Plot Details. Not ending.

The film takes place in scenic South Africa. We get the National Geographic tour. The film starts out great showing us Halle Berry's cleavage, a guy filming her cleavage, and then they throw a shark into the film...and no more cleavage. Halle's hobby is to pet Great Whites in open water out of a cage. She is married to Jeff who films the action. So when sharks suddenly behave badly, Halle quits diving with them.

After a year, Jeff is trying to get back with Halle. The have fights about the relationship. The film contains Halle doing a first person philosophical narration and the music is very tame, not what one expects for an action/thriller. Halle who has spent 10 years in the water doesn't like the smell of fish and screams when someone tries to push her in. Clearly this is an action flick written for women, or by a woman (Amy Sorlie). In one scene Jeff apologizes for whatever it was that made Halle angry. Halle is angry that he doesn't know why she is angry and won't tell him...because he should know!  She finally says, ""You have no idea what's wrong with me!""

As Halle's business starts to fail, a wealthy Brit (Ralph Brown) trying to connect with his son (Mark Elderkin) wants to swim with Great Whites without a cage. Halle is reluctant but agrees.

They set out in the water to go dancing with sharks. And if everything went well, there wouldn't be a movie. Dad fights with son, Jeff fights with dad, Halle fights with Jeff, and Halle fights with dad. At this point I was hoping a two headed mega shark would swallow the whole boat. The climatic scene I can't detail because I have no idea what is happening. Everyone is in the same dark suits and it is dark. The full view film of the sharks appear to be stock footage. (Ed Wood would be so proud.) This is more of a drama with some poorly shot action scenes.

No f-bombs (that I caught), sex, or nudity. Some PG-13 name calling. Might be enjoyed by women who like a soft female lead in an ""action thriller.""",1331942400,41,2020,4.445945945945946
8513068,3,B0079ZWU5W,"Dark Tide stars Halle Berry as Kate, a shark diver who, along with her husband Jeff (Olivier Martinez) has aspirations to make nature films educating the general public about sharks. But in the meantime, they make their living taking people out on the cape to free dive with great whites. Yes, that does seem contradictory. This movie seems to be trying to make a point about that. It fails.

Tragedy strikes and a grief-stricken Kate separates from Jeff and stops taking shark diving charters. That was apparently where the big bucks were because Kate is not making enough money chartering whale watchers to pay her bills and her boat is about to be impounded. Cue the return of Jeff, with an offer from a wealthy Englishman who wants to dive with sharks and is willing to pay an obscene amount of money to do it.

The cinematography is excellent, especially underwater. The sharks are real. The actors are all good, and the premise is fine. This should have been a better movie. It's hamstrung by trying to cash checks on pathos that it doesn't earn. It wants you to care deeply about Kate's employee, who you only know for one scene that makes no effort to focus on his character. It wants you to care about the jerk millionaire who wants to commit death by shark and takes his least favorite son along to bear witness. The revelation of what that's about strikes an emotionally tone deaf note because the guy has been presented as overbearing up to and even after that point, and not in a sympathetic way. Then the movie wants you to care about Kate and Jeff when they wind up in a disaster of their own making. Quite frankly, the only one left for me to care about in that scenario was the least favorite son.

The movie does do a good job of setting up some tense maritime danger scenes, especially during the storm. If you've ever been at sea you know how dangerous a situation that is, and the movie does a good job of depicting that kind of panic. The abalone poaching scene is getting some flack, but that scene was also extremely tense and even though it is unconnected to anything actually going on in the main plot it was a welcome reprieve from the relationship drama that is everything in this movie that is not set at sea. The groundpounder scenes are tedious. There was one scene set in a restaurant where Kate is meeting with Jeff and the Jerk Millionaire to discuss terms. I was bored and needed to visit the powder room. When I came back from the powder room they were still at the table talking. That's bad pacing.

I would agree with the reviewers who suggest to watch this with the sound off, then turn the sound back on when something cool is happening. There are some stunning sequences connected by bad movie.",1527379200,,2735,4.508064516129032
