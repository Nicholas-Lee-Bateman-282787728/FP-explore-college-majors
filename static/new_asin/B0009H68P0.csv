8060630,1,B0009H68P0,"Like most of the people with a new flat screen TV I wanted to have an aquarium playing in the background, I got this DVD and it just doesn't look right in my 46 inches screen, I don't like it at all, if you are a person like me, don't get the dvd, get yourself a screen saver and connect your computer through the VGA port that is what really looks amazing !",1158796800,3,358,3.9178082191780823
8060631,5,B0009H68P0,I had the screensaver for my computer and loved it.  I was psyched to see it is now on DVD and I can show it on my TV.  Very innovative idea to convert these computer screensavers to DVD.  It's the best.,1133913600,,203,3.902439024390244
8060632,5,B0009H68P0,"This animated DVD screensaver is a really neat product; it reminds me of a Disney film. I have a big flat-panel TV hanging on my living room wall and this is useful when your TV is turned off because your not staring at a blank screen on the wall. It's almost like a picture frame, but animated. What is neat about this product is the animated fish; they look so real. They are extremely vibrant and beautiful in each scene. It is mesmerizing and totally cool. I've seen other Aquarium DVDs out there and I would have to choose this one among the rest of them because it continuously loops from scene to scene and the lighting is great. What a great product!",1133913600,2,658,4.357723577235772
8060633,1,B0009H68P0,I was disapointed with this DVD..the fish do not look real and the soundtrack and natural sounds are less than soothing!,1130630400,9,120,4.761904761904762
8060634,1,B0009H68P0,"This product is a computer graphics program, not video of real fish.  It is barely better than the standard windows screen saver on your home computer, and the fake bubble soundtrack is annoying.  I was clearly very disappointed when watching the DVD and returned it for the Plasmaquarium DVD which is a great video of real fish in multiple aquariums.  I wish it was clear in the description of this product that it was not a real aquarium.",1130371200,30,440,4.615384615384615
8060635,5,B0009H68P0,It looks so real. I play it at night with the lights off and it relaxes me so much. I love it !!!,1126137600,,97,3.260869565217391
