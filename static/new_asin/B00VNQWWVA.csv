7100340,5,B00VNQWWVA,This DVD of Dick Cavett's Vietnam was very educational. Have watched it several times since it arrived.,1440460800,2,103,5.117647058823529
7100341,5,B00VNQWWVA,"This is the second hour-long (well, 55 minutes) documentary to be produced for PBS using archival footage from Dick Cavett's fabulous ABC-TV series (that ran from 1968-1975. The first was called ""Dick Cavett's Watergate"" and featured excerpts for the Cavett show with new comments from Cavett (who still has his boyish looks and charm).

This time around there are plenty of excerpts from the Cavett Show but a lot more archival news footage from newsreels and TV (Walter Cronkite on CBS, Harry K. Smith - for some reason, never identified! - on ABC). There are comments from Cavett himself as well as a few historians who analyze the war and General Wesley Clark, who gives his perspective - having served in Vietnam.

There are plenty of celebrities like Jane Fonda, Warren Beatty, Woody Allen, and Groucho Marx, but some, like Muhammed Ali, are never ide notified. Okay, MOST older folks know Ali, but this DVD could have been more useful in schools if EVERY person was identified.

One of the ""gems"" from the Cavett archive is the program where Cavett discusses the war with the Rev. Billy Graham who was actually FOR the war. Cavett then brings out a soldier who fought in Vietnam and was opposed to it. His name? John Kerry! Another highlight is the show where Cavett holds a roundtable with five returning vets who tell what it was ""really like"".

The DVD has no special bonuses (darn!), but it shows the amazing archival material that was preserved by Cavett (he owns the footage which most networks would erase.). I'm sure most of these claps have not been seen in over 50 years. It would be great to have LOTS more of this material available to see. (There were some box sets of celebrity interviews released many years ago, but then they stopped.) I hope that PBS will release longer versions and add bonus material. And Cavett is still around to comment on the shows.

Meanwhile, even with its flaws, I can highly recommend this DVD for anyone who was alive during the 1960s and 70s. And, it should be in every school library.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7100342,5,B00VNQWWVA,"This a review of this show that was aired on PBS a month ago.... The show was an excellent account from all sides of the war as seen from Hollywood's stars, White House Officials, Politicians, and others as they appeared on the Dick Cavett Show in the late sixties and early seventies. It was very well made and highly informative. From the late 1940's to the Fall of Saigon this 60 minute documentary is fully charged with information about a war nobody fully understands...",1433116800,6,475,4.666666666666667

For those who were alive then, they'll be reminded of how vital issues of the day could be discussed on television, at length & in depth, with intelligence as well as passion. Dick Cavett was the perfect host for this, knowing when to let his guests talk, asking short but thought-provoking questions, and trusting his viewers to have the brains & complexity of feeling to listen, mull, judge for themselves. I wish we could see & join in this level of discourse today.

My only complaint? The same as that of previous reviewers: I wish there was much more than just an hour of these discussions. But as an introductory overview, told on the pulse of the moment by those in the thick of it, this is certainly a great starting point. Most highly recommended!",1507939200,,1148,5.273224043715847
8710742,3,B00VNQWWVA,I want a more comprehensive DVD set of Dick Cavette's broadcasts during the Vietnam era. I see that they are available streaming but that is not good enough. When the issue is controversial information I do not want to merely borrow access to the document from somebody's stream. I want a hard copy for my own personal archives.,1501718400,,328,4.672413793103448

Its that America that is captured in the Cavett interviews.  Its the America that is wounded, scarred by this commitment in Southeast Asia and its now trying to figure out a way to get out.

The above is said at the beginning of this extremely informative and entertaining documentary that is composed of outtakes from Dick Cavetts first and most popular television talk show.

Cavett is an American television personality and former talk show host notable for his conversational style and in-depth discussions.  He has appeared regularly on U.S. television for five decades starting in the late 1960s through the 2000s.

An older Cavett, who narrates this documentary, gives us some background at the beginning of it:

Between 1968 and 1975, when my show aired on ABC, the Vietnam War [Nov 1955 to Apr 1975] was raging in Southeast Asia and the reaction at home [in America] was intense.  While I set out to do an entertaining talk show, you could not keep [the] Vietnam [War] out of the conversation.

This documentary corresponds with the fortieth anniversary of the Fall of Saigon (Apr 30, 1975) and the end of Americas presence in Vietnam.  (Saigon is Vietnams largest city now officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City).  It re-examines the conflict and its impact on America through interviews that are combined with archival footage, network news broadcasts, and newly filmed interviews with Cavett and other experts.

The people youll see in this documentary include celebrities (like Warren Beatty, Jane Fonda, Woody Allen who gives some good zingers), newscasters (such as Walter Cronkite), and politicians (for example: Richard Nixon, John Kerry).

Finally, what I did before viewing this documentary was read some basic information on the Vietnam War and the geography of the region. I found doing this made for a truly educational experience.  (Note that you don't have to do this.)

In conclusion, this is truly an exceptional documentary, both educational and entertaining, that examines a highly controversial period in American history.

(2015;  55 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  PBS)
