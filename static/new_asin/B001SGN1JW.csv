8339864,5,B001SGN1JW,I saw the effort that went into making this first movie. Serious work and professionalism show in the the end product: a very well acted  (most of the actors are pursuing excellent careers) and expertly photographed film. So much more interesting than a lot of the junk being peddled by major studios!,1251158400,,301,4.788461538461538
8339865,5,B001SGN1JW,"This movie has an indie flair, but does not feel like it was produced by an amateur. I really enjoyed it. The plot is nothing to write home about, but the acting and crafting of the scenes (each scene is short and sweet; nothing is dragged out) is suberb. I highly recommend this movie!",1243987200,,286,4.314814814814815
