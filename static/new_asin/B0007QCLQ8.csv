Lots of filthy language (including G.D., Jesus and many more - so disappointed, as it could have been so much better without the filthy language). Lots of sexual situations (including much talk of S&M), if you like that kind of thing, which we do not in a movie. Tons of drinking alcohol and alcoholism scenes. Rage and fighting. Divorce and cheating. Overall, it was Very Depressing - everyone has so many problems that it left me feeling drained and down. I will not watch this again. Such a far cry from the ""Christy"" Series that Kellie was in - where is that nice girl now?! Not here, that's for sure! What a waste of a movie and nearly 2 hours of my life.",1456185600,2,788,4.441379310344828

8050490,2,B0007QCLQ8,"This DVD was a disappointment for us.  We really like Kellie Martin and have enjoyed her a lot on different DVD's, such as the Mystery Woman set and several others.  This one contained frequent coarse language, which is a real negative for us.",1379635200,2,243,4.627906976744186

8050492,5,B0007QCLQ8,"I was very happy to see that this movie was for sale and quickly bought it! I had watched it several times on TV and loved it! Although it may be formatted a little different, it is still worth the time and money to own it and watch it!  I think that it's a great movie and I think that Kellie Martin's character is played out very well!  I would definetly recommend this movie!",1164153600,5,378,4.094594594594595
8050493,2,B0007QCLQ8,"This is a movie DESPERATELY in search of an identity.

  It seems to be trying to be a family drama but without much sense of direction. There are all sorts of loose ends. First, there is the alcoholic mother who is confronted by her family but never really pushed into treatment. Then there is the daughter whose husband leaves her on Thanksgiving without much explanation.

  The movie could have worked IF:

1. It had a shred of believability. The characterizations aren't believable and the story line is weak, at best. Kellie Martin, who plays the divorced daughter, is supposed to be brave and stoic but instead comes off as hard and uncompassionate.

2 There was any pivotal moment - or even a few key moments. But no, there are no resolutions that make sense and more than a few cheap teasers that insult the viewer's intelligence, including one scene where Ms. Martin nearly falls into her bed with her sister's husband - and THEN has the nerve to tell him that if he EVER cheats on her sister, she'll kill him.... just as if she didn't go to the edge with him earlier in the movie.

  Also, the movie seems to meander all over the place and (SPOILER ALERT) by the end of the movie, Mom is still a raging alcoholic and...in what is supposed to be a lightbulb moment, I assume..the divorced daughter realizes that ""even a single note can sound lovely"" and so she rejects her ex when he comes begging for another chance.

  In short, this a formula movie with a capital F. Barely watchable and only if the choice is between this and watching paint dry.",1111363200,9,1559,4.521428571428571
8050494,1,B0007QCLQ8,"If there were a choice below 1 star, that would be my rating for this movie.  I bought at Walmart -- this and another movie bundled for $5.98.  I should have known by the price, that it couldn't be much of a movie.  Horribly depressing, terrible storyline.  I almost stopped watching half-way through, but kept thinking something may happen to redeem this movie.  I was wrong!  Don't even want to donate this movie to church rummage sale.  Believe I will just throw it away!",1110931200,8,474,4.571428571428571
