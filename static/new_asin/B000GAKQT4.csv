8130101,3,B000GAKQT4,"Graham Kerr was the charming Galloping Gourmet of TV legend, long before Gordon Ramsay ever sent back a dish or dressed down a chef.
When you think of the current franchise of cooking shows, most based on criticism and panic in the kitchen, you might think back wistfully to the days of yore(if you were around) when Graham Kerr had a polite, genteel, and open form of cooking and kitchen management.  He would make you smile, something that Gordon Ramsay has never done(I'm a fan of his, nonetheless.)
Ah, but there's a problem here.  Graham Kerr was last seen,  as in these disks, as jumping on the health bandwagon.  Healthy cooking is still around, of course, but the majority of great chefs shook it off quickly and maintained the great culinary arts which depend upon all ingredients being usable.  Healthy cooking like the practices on these disks eliminates so many fats, sugars, and practices that flavor is a rare commodity.  If cooking was strictly a pursuit of 'health', then we would eat boiled or raw foods with no condiments or flavoring agents.
The early Galloping Gourmet is not evident, as I remember him, on these disks and thus, you should only get it if you want to see the man once again or if you actually like 'healthy cuisine'.",1419897600,,1252,4.69406392694064
