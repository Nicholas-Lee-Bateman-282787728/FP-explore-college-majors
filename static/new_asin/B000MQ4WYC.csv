2738534,5,B000MQ4WYC,"I knew the name ""Percy L. Julian"" growing up in Phoenix, Arizona because there is a Phoenix Elementary School District #1 School named after this great scientist.  However, I really didn't know anything more than that.

In this DVD you will discover: His house was firebombed.  He lost his job on the eve of the Depression.  He took on powerful, entrenched interests in the scientific establishment and overcame countless obstacles to become a world-class chemist, a self-made millionaire, and a humanitarian.  Yet despite his achievements, Percy Julian's story is largely unknown.

The grandson of Alabama slaves, Julian broke the color barrier in American science more than a decade before Jackie Robinson did in baseball.  A brilliant innovator, he discovered a way to turn soybeans into synthetic steroids on an industrial scale, helping to make cortisone (used to treat arthritis) available to millions.

Watch and learn.  Enjoy!",1207872000,,934,5.342465753424658

2738536,4,B000MQ4WYC,"It's very fascinating to me that this work was a NOVA project, rather than an American Experience one.  I really wonder if PBS were trying to get hardcore scientists to think about history, race, and other matters they might not usually explore.

I disagree somewhat with the title.  Yes, more people may have heard of George Washington Carver, however, Dr. Julian is not ""forgotten.""  There's an important high school in Chicago named after him.  He also has a US postal stamp made in his honor.  My guess is that he's beloved in Black scientific circles.

Too often, many (mis)conclude that ""the Emancipation Proclamation solved everything for Blacks"" or ""the Civil Rights movement corrected any other leftover matters for them.""  This work provides numerous examples of anti-Black racism.  Just as Sandra Day O'Connor was not given legal jobs after finishing at the top of her law class, Dr. Julian was constantly rejected from graduate programs.  Just as Harvard recently disrespected Dr. Cornel West, Harvard prevented Dr. Julian from finishing his Ph. D. there.  Just as Malcolm X's teacher told him he couldn't dream to be a professional, white scientists told Dr. Julian he should be more than satisfied that he had an undergraduate degree.  I love how this work demonstrated that racism continually caused problems for this talented brother.

On the other hand, I don't think non-Blacks will be ""threatened"" by this work.  As. Dr. Julian faced much institutional racism, he also had several white allies that aided him.  The fact here reminded me of Thomas and Dr. Blaylock, Jesse Owens and Lutz Lung, or even the interracial buddies of ""Brian's Song.""  I also loved seeing that Dr. Julian lifted as he climbed.  He seems to have hired and encouraged numerous female and non-white scientists younger than him.

I struggle with the length of the work.  This could have been one hour, rather than two, if it weren't for all the acting and monologues.  I suppose the fluff was added to lure in everyday viewers and scientists that dislike other subjects.  As a person who doesn't care for science, there was much talk of chemistry for which I could not care less.  However, since that field is where he earned his fame, it's logical that they went deep into that topic.

This was a strong work, perfect for Black History Month.  It's length may prohibit school classes from seeing it in one class period.  Still, for those who haven't heard of this genius and his struggles, it will be quite inspiring.",1170806400,15,2508,4.914285714285715
2738543,5,B000MQ4WYC,"Before watching this, I had no idea how much I (and everyone else) owe to Percy Julian. Life today would be completely different were it not for his genius.",1377734400,2,156,4.413793103448276
2738544,4,B000MQ4WYC,The movie/documentary was very interesting.  I knew nothing about the person prior to the movie.  The movie supports the need for education among people of color and highlights the difficulties faced with obtaining and using that education.,1369872000,3,240,5.45945945945946
2738545,5,B000MQ4WYC,"The scientific work of Percy Julian is a must read for all educators and historians. It depicts the mastery, the dedication of his work, and the impact it made on American science. I highly recommend this video to all.",1357257600,,218,4.615384615384615

2738548,5,B000MQ4WYC,"I highly recommend this NOVA production.  Beautifully written and acted, it seems to me to be the result of a team who loved and respected Dr. Julian for his contribution to healthcare and for his dedication to humanity.  I enjoyed the handling of the science as well as the attention to his personal, professional and community social life.  I have benefitted from Dr. Julian's contribution to my well-being through cortizone which singularly allows me to live a productive life.  I'm sure my home is more beautiful as a result of his work with paints.  The story of racism in America is tragic.  I watch this program over and over.  Percy Julian's personal fight against injustice and his commitment to serve people, inspire my own humble efforts to bring about better lives for individuals, families and communities.  This is a dvd to share.",1312675200,,844,4.894366197183099
2738549,5,B000MQ4WYC,"Percy Julian was born in 1899 Alabama and lived his most productive years in Chicago as a pioneering organic chemist. He worked on a variety of industrial applications, but he is best-known for his research on alkaloids and steroids, including applications that offered cures for diseases. Every step of the way, he encountered racial barriers, including in post-World War II Oak Park, where his large home on East Avenue was bombed when his children were at home with a baby-sitter and Julian and his wife were out of town. The film combines historical footage with dramatization, drawing on his own words. This documentary also sets the standard for portraying complex scientific ideas in a way that the educated viewer can understand.  Percy Julian's life must not be forgotten.",1264636800,3,781,5.1015625

2738552,4,B000MQ4WYC,"This video is of the best quality ever.  It was amazingly well created. It shows the life of Julian Percy and at the same time, it presents the chemical accomplishments he made in a very fair manner. It shows the struggles Percy had as a black chemist in a racist American society, but not while he lived in Austria. I highly recommed this video to everyone, either if you are studying chemistry, or if you are interested in learning the struggles minorities have in the American society.  But watch it in two sessions.  I think this two hour video is a little bit too much for anybody. I hope Nova continues to make more videos available.",1214784000,3,639,4.491379310344827

Julian was a genius who pursued the study of chemistry in spite of tremendous adversity which would have stopped most people. After gaining his degrees he went on to excel in research in natural products chemistry, made many discoveries, mentored students, and was finally recognized for all his work in chemistry.

8170746,5,B000MQ4WYC,"I have seldom been more profoundly moved in watching a DVD as was the case with NOVA: Percy Julian - Forgotten Genius.  Percy Julian suffered unspeakable indignities at the hands of a creul sadistic racist United States society yet he overcame this nightmare at every opportunity.  Prople would suggest that things have changed a great deal since the times of Percy Julian and they would be only partly right.  Racism is still as strong and potent as it was in the days of Percy Julian.  Today's racism just wears a more sophisticated face that is all too often cloaked in the garb of ""political conservatism among other incarnations!""

An intelligent black man today still has a harder journey to success even when he like Percy Julian plays by the rigged rules of the white power establishment.  Yet Percy Julian is still an awe inspiring figure today for the very reason that despite the odds and evils in his path he never gave up.  Percy Julian beat the white power scienece elite at their own rigged games more times than they wanted to admit.  In essence Percy Julian flew further and higher in the annals of science on one battered wing than much vaunted white scientists of his day flew on two of the best high powered wings ivy league college educations could provide.

As an autistic black man who was constantly told he would amount to nothing, I deeply identify with the struggles of Percy Julian because his life mirrors my own struggles in so many ways.  Percy Julians parents felt education was the path out of poverty a ideal shared by my own parents.  I too struggled and successfully rode a meagar education out of the ghetto and into a life of relative luxury.  Today I give speeches at white institutions that in days not too long past would have barred my admittance just as Percy Julian did.  This Percy Julian was genius and remains an inspiration to all who know of his like.

This DVD is required viewing for all good people but especially needed by young black kids who think the ghetto is a trap from which they can noever escape.  The ghetto has ways out if you build your education no matter what people say.  The way from ghetto to success is often a convoluted and challenged filled path for a black man even in the best of times.  Yet as ugly and pervasive as racism was in Percy Julian's day we must never forget those few great white men, ladies and institutions who swam against the prevailing racist tide by helping people like Percy Julian.  It would be just plain wrong to say the whole of the white race is a single focus of evil.

Even today in my success I have white brothers, sisters and institutions that have alone and collectively moved mountains so I could reach heights of achievement I never dreamed possible.  I just wish more black kids looked to Percy Julian as a role model rather than these sports players.  It's simple math.  There are a lot more doctors, teachers, chemical engineers jobs in the economy making low 6 figures a year than there are sports superstars pulling in 8 figure salaries.  I find it strangely fun being a black professional.  Today in meetings are still populated mostly by white folks but, there are more black folks and people of color than ever before.  One things HAS changed since Percy Julian's time.  When a black man reaches the professional management ranks about 50% of his coworkers will treat him with respect at least to his face which was not the case in Percy Julian's time.  I've found that of that 50% that treat black professionals with respect half of that 50% of white professionals have the potential to become great and trusted friends.  Black white friendships even among professionals was a far more rare thing in the time of Percy Julian.

These are but some of the insights this NOVA: Percy Julian - Forgotten Genius DVD shares.  This NOVA: Percy Julian - Forgotten Genius is a great lesson for people of all races, creeds and colors.",1407369600,3,3940,4.627338129496403
