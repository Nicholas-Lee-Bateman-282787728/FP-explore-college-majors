8547754,5,B00A7CDR1K,"I've purchased some of the other Rock House Method DVDs and have been generally disappointed with the quality of the instruction.  This DVD exceeded my expectations and I find myself returning to it quite often.

With the package, you get two DVDs, one DVD has a PDF with the supporting tab, the other comes with a lesson book to follow along.  All of the video content can be transferred from the DVD directly to your iPad or other mobile device, outstanding feature in my opinion.  My one complaint is that the lesson numbers in the book don't correlate with the video numbers.  There are a range of techniques represented from scales, to leads and rhythm parts, and warmup exercises.

Some of the material is far above my abilities, especially the lessons on leads/solos but it's nice to be able to grow into the DVD over time as my skills improve. Oli is a natural teacher and the lessons don't feel rehearsed or forced, he clearly enjoys playing guitar.  I wish there were a bit more detail/tricks on some of the lessons and longer rhythm break downs but the format doesn't lend itself well to that.  Oli is a technically gifted player and more than once I found myself laughing when he would play a portion of the song slowly, followed by an ""up to tempo"" version...very different.  This is a good instructional DVD to build chops and to learn some of the thinking that goes into ATR songs.",1360022400,,1396,4.596774193548387
