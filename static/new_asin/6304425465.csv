7871170,1,6304425465,"This is a poorly written attempt to use reenactors to tell the life of J. Caesar.  The guy who plays Caesar would be a great Marius, but Caesar was younger and better looking, and could act!  The reenactors uniforms and  equipments are 100+ years too late in period, (some are 300 years too late)  and are about as good as using Franco-Prussian uniformed fellows to show  the Napoleonic Wars!  Don't waste your money on this horrid attempt to  steal you denarii!  Buyer Beware!  Buy a Steve Reeves movie instead!",949536000,22,512,4.662921348314606
