8641059,5,B00ID7OKEY,"For those of you who were around for Carman's earlier days and music videos you will LOVE this collection all in one place. Talk about a trip down Memory Lane! Fantastic! Yes, so some of the videos are a little ""old-fashioned"" for today's standards but the message is still the same. (Many of them though could have been filmed yesterday.) Amazing to see what Carman was ""preaching"" about so strongly against in the 80's and 90's is still relevant today and actually even more so. What was your favorite Carman music video? Revival in the Land? Witches Invitation? Satan: Bite the Dust? Great God? America Again? R.I.O.T? No Monsters? How about the TV broadcast Halloween 3:16? The above is just a snippet of what is on these 3 DVD's.

FANTASTIC! FANTASTIC! Our younger kids who are seeing Carman for the first time are LOVING them! The rest of us are enjoying reminiscing!

Not sure why Amazon has this priced SO high as you can purchase this 3 DVD set at Carman's concert for only $15. Let's hope someone starts selling them cheaper on here!",1448668800,,1043,4.663043478260869
