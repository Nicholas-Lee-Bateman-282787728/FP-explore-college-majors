7989510,1,B000095IZZ,"My husband and I bought this in an attempt to find a sophisticated dance for our wedding.  This DVD was so cheesy.  I mean, we technically learned the dance (which we didn't end up doing), but it was painful watching the DVD in the process.",1360281600,,240,4.311111111111111
7989511,2,B000095IZZ,My hubby is not a dancer...but this vid was really tooo basic.  save your money on this one,1215043200,,91,4.055555555555555
7989512,2,B000095IZZ,"I agree with the others who gave a poor review. My husband agreed to try and learn to dance, but after seeing how 70's this was, he reneged on his promise. I believe we could have learned to dance but this was so out-of date (made in 20043 but filmed in the 70's) he just said ""no way.""",1209168000,,286,3.9482758620689653
7989513,4,B000095IZZ,"My husband and I were looking to not make fools of ourselves on our wedding day (since my niece and her hubby HAD looked ridiculous dancing like a couple of teenagers at their first dance). I bought this DVD because it was cheap and had a couple of dances that are fairly timeless.
As for the accounts that it's out of date, well, the instructor and his partner are dressed in what would be considered out of style clothes, but the Waltz never goes out of style.
It was just what we needed, and my kids even got into it and it became a PE lesson for our homeschool curriculum.
I think it's a perfect beginner dance video and if you are looking for something to help you get through your wedding day without feeling like an idiot, buy it!",1205193600,2,737,4.271428571428571
7989514,5,B000095IZZ,"Yes the couple dancing were dressed in outdated clothing.  What does that matter?  I bought the tape to learn how to dance, not to see what the instructor was wearing. The dances were simple and the instructions very easy to follow.  It accomplished what I needed it to accomplish.  I will be dancing at my son's and daughter's weddings this summer.",1118707200,10,349,4.672131147540983
7989515,1,B000095IZZ,"I was so disappointed with the DVD.  On the cover was a very modern couple, but when I watched it, I was so turned off.  I don't know how else to learn the steps cuz I have to watch the 80s couple's dance steps.  The wedding gown was so ancient on the DVD with wings and ugly veil that look like a huge butterfly on her head.  Don't get it.... not worth it.",1111795200,,357,3.8493150684931505
7989516,2,B000095IZZ,"I completely agree with the other review.

The cover of the DVD has a younger/modern couple.

However the video itself is from the early 90's - seems like 80's though! VERY outdated. You'll know it as soon as the 1st scene!!!",1106179200,,225,4.463414634146342
7989517,4,B000095IZZ,"I have been dancing a wide variety of styles for a while now and collect dance instruction DVDs and books--as well as have regular private and group instruction. Dance is a passion that I have dedicated myself to.
I love this DVD. It is has good basic and intermediate info, and is easy to follow (at a low price, and with a music CD to boot). I do not see it as a substitute for real good solid one-on-one training with a live dance instructor--but as a nice supplement. And in spite of my dance experience I find that there is always something new that I learn from different instructors than my regular one, and how they explain something in a slightly different way or show some nuance I had not noticed before.
I love Kyle's relaxed, calm, patient style of teaching on this DVD.  And I did like the little gentle musical interludes between lessons showing ordinary people dancing, enjoying themselves, and exuding their love of dance. This is what dance is about.
Kyle's everyman, all-American demeanor underscores that anyone can learn how to dance with proper training and dedication.",1085184000,16,1091,4.712041884816754
7989518,1,B000095IZZ,"This video is very misleading.  It shows a younger couple on the front very modern looking, copywrite 2003, then when you watch it, everything is from the 80's from way outdated dance steps.  I can't see anyone under 80 dancing to these dances.",1082937600,3,244,4.651162790697675
