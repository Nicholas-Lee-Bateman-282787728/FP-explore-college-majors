1697534,5,B0000640T0,"I saw this movie when it first came out on television a few months ago, and wanted to watch it again right away. Now with it on DVD, I can watch it whenever I want. Kristin Kreuk is the perfect young lady to play Snow White, she has the natural beauty of Snow White, and played Snow White flawlessly.
Unlike the Disney version, this version of Snow White sticks closer to the Grimm tale, taking the mild horror aspect, and balancing it with the enchantment and hints of comedy and irony.
I can't say that this DVD is packed with extras, but there are a few there. A commentery track I was hoping would be there wasn't present, but there is a short behind the scenes program and a Neutrogena Commercial featuring Kristin Kreuk.",1025827200,2,726,4.425373134328358
1697535,5,B0000640T0,"Growing up, I love watching the Disney cartoon. The story was so enchanting. I have read the original story by the Brothers Grimm and it was very dark. I liked this version a lot because it combines the best parts of the original story, but sweetens it up enough so its enjoyable. It also has added clever surprises not found in any other version of the story, not to mention neat special effects considdering its low budget and the fact that it was made for television. Kristin Kreuk of the WB's Smallville makes her feature film debut as Snow White, the sixteen year old princess whos father has fallen under the spell of her evil stepmother, played by Miranda Richardson from t.v's Merlin and Alice In Wonderland. The prince is also played by the young man who played Karl in Dinotopia. This movie is not rated, but I would rate it PG. It contains no language or violence, but it does steer towards the darker side of this classic fairy tale and may not be sutible for the younger audience. That's what the cartoon is for.",1022025600,5,1025,4.516129032258065
1697536,1,B0000640T0,"Watching this program on ABC induced extreme trigger-finger on my remote.  Sure, it was beautiful:  Kristen Kreuk was gorgeous, the prince was cute and the special effects were nice to watch.  But beauty does not a good film make!  I was so looking forward to seeing a new version of the story- one with substance- but ""Snow White- Fairest of Them All"" definitely did not deliver on that count.  Snow White herself barely had any lines; so how were we supposed to care about her as a character?  The only mildly entertaining part of this production was Miranda Richardson's evil queen, but even that got old after awhile.  Oh, and by the way, I will shoot myself if I ever again hear ""You are.  You are.  You are the fairest of them all!"" repeated ad nauseum!",1017014400,3,759,4.522058823529412
1697537,1,B0000640T0,"Don't be misled by the title of this movie. It IS NOT Snow White. It may have some elements of Disney's Snow White, but none of it's special effects or new storyline capture the true heart or magic of Snow White.
 It is unfortunate when producers and script writers decide to take a new spin on an fairy tale and end up totally destroying the magic. In this version of Snow White, the dwarves are named after days of the week, and when they stand in a straight line, they can form a rainbow to take them anywhere. This movie does not have a magic mirror with a character inside.  Instead, any mirror in the castle can exclaim who is the fairest of them all. The prince of the story is turned into a bear, and then into a snow globe (so creative). The Queen visits Snow White not as an ugly witch, but in the body of Snow White's mother who died when she was born. Snow White isn't even placed into glass coffin; instead, the dwarves freeze her into a block of ice. You know the magic of Snow White is completely gone when the prince, still as a bear, licks down this huge block of ice before Snow White wakes up.
 It is not just that the plot was bad in this movie, but the dialogue and character of Snow White seemed frozen throughout the entire movie. When she isn't saying a line or two, her face looks cold and unfeeling. You wouldn't see this Snow White bursting into song or dance! When the evil witch visits Snow White, Snow White says one thing I won't forget: ""yes, I'm so tired..."" Believe me, this was the only line I could relate with her, as I was very tired of this movie!
 If you want to watch Snow White, buy the Disney version.  If you want to see a cheap imitation with no magic, this movie is for you.",1016323200,6,1720,4.18429003021148
1697538,5,B0000640T0,"It's not your traditional version of the Grimm's famous story, but this effort by Hallmark Entertainment (distributed by Disney) certainly has it's merits!
Caroline Thompson's script tells the traditional story of the princess with ""skin as white as snow"" and the jealous stepmother who wishes her stepdaughter dead.  But Thompson decides to elaborate the story with several touches of her own.  For instance, Snow White's father, John (played by Tom Irwin), releases a ""jinn"" or ""genie"" type creature (Clancy Brown) from a frozen prison in the ice.  To show his thanks, the creature grants John three wishes: 1) milk for his infant daughter, 2) a kingdom, and 3) a queen.  But the candidate chosen to sit at King John's side, is none other than the creature's hideous sister, Elsbeth (Miranda Richardsn).  As an ""act of kindness"" to his sister, he transforms her blemished skin to worldly beauty.  But King John's heart still lies with his dead wife, Josephine (Vera Farmiga).  So, Elspeth's first spell of manipulation is cast.
Another added plot twist borrows from another Grimm's story, ""Snow White and Rose Red"".  Queen Elsbeth lets her raging hormones get the best of her when Prince Alfred (Tyron Leitso) spurns her lusty advances.  For revenge, Elsbeth turns the prince into a bear, who then seeks out Snow White to help break the spell.
In a psychological twist, Esbeth disguises herself as Josephine, Snow White's mother, when she delivers the poisoned apple.  Quite clever.
Hallmark Entertainment regular Miranda Richardson is perfectly cast as the woman who's sole existence rides on being ""fairest in the land"".  In her usual brilliant way, Richardson's performance is deranged yet humorous all at once.
Kristin Kreuk (WB's ""Smallville"") as ""Snow White"" gives a deeper performance than one would expect.  Rather than turning the princess into a sugary sweet victim, Kreuk brings out the human qualities of a teenager who longs to be seen as more than the beauty she is.  Because of Elsbeth's spell on him, her father ignores her.  Her stepmother hates her.  The visiting prince swoons over her.  The poor girl simply wants to be loved and known for the person behind the beautiful face.  Kreuk was the perfect choice.
The seven dwarfs are creatively reworked as the creatures that control the weather.  They travel around the countryside as a rainbow, with each of them playing a different color.  Named for the days of the week, each dwarf's personality comes from the old nursery rhyme' ""Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace....."".  Warwick Davis, of Ewok fame, plays ""Saturday"".  Davis is no stranger the Snow White story, having performed in and directed many pantomime productions in his homeland of England.  In another creative twist, Vincent Schiavelli plays ""Wednesday""....the only ""dwarf"" over 4.5 feet tall!  Michael J. Anderson (Twin Peaks) plays ""Sunday"" the kind-hearted sympathetic leader of the ""magnificent seven"".
As in anything she is in, Vera Farmiga is wonderful.  She is under used sadly, as Josephine is buried for most of the film.  Thankfully she is brought back for the famous apple sequence.
If you are expecting a live action version of the Disney 1937 classic, you will be greatly disappointed.  The film rides on it's own merit and will hopefully become another family classic.  Thanks Hallmark!",1016323200,20,3366,5.1060329067641685
1697539,5,B0000640T0,"I only saw this movie a few days ago and and so happy to be able to preorder this title so soon. I loved the choices of Miranda Richardson as the evil stepmother and Kristen Kriek as Snow White. I must say that I think this is my favourite role for Miranda Richardson, much better than Merlin. Kristen Kriek seemed perfect for her role too after seeing her in the WB series Smallville, I could easily see her in this fairy tale role.
At first, I was troubled by the seven dwarfs however as 1 of them was not a small person but a normal sized human but as the movie progressed, I began to see that it was not his physical size that was the problem but his mental attitude - which is why he and the other 6 drawfs didn't really see any difference between them or anyone else for that matter.
The special effects were great - especially the magic behind the enchanted mirror, the costumes and the sets. I believe this version to be suitable for the whole family. I just hope that there are lots of extra features on the DVD like interviews, beind the scenes, trailors, maybe even screen tests...",1016323200,4,1092,4.305825242718447

1697562,5,B0000640T0,A fresh new take on the Snow White story. Not the same old thing over and over. I like the new view of the dwarves. This movie is nice because it's closer to being a little more mature. The brothers Grimm original stories were for adults not children but then they were pressured into changing them by the majority of that era. I will not write about the changes in this take of the movie because of spoilers. Just take my word for it when I say that this is a must see movie. Very good acting and supporting cast.,1425427200,,514,4.15
1697563,2,B0000640T0,"Pretty grim, pun intended. If you're looking for an authentic fairy tale that won't bore you to tears, please skip this overblown rewrite. Ms Richardson aka Rita Skeeter is just okay hamming it up as the evil queen. The other actors do their best with the clunky script that, shall we say, fully utilizes cast's dictated flat SoCal accents and speech patterns.

Unbalanced emotion/action elements make women unlikeable and men tepid, and there is nothing that allows the audience connect with Ms Kreuk's titular character, who comes across as vacant and wooden, partly because her lines are sparse and unconvincing.

The MacGuffin of a bewitching glass/mirror shard in the eye (or in the king's heart?? how did that get there?) is a device I seem to recall from H. C. Andersen's Snow Queen tale.

Whom are we rooting for? The evil queen? No. Snow White? nuh uh. The poor father/king? almost. The annoying and underutilized little people? er, no. The evil snow-sorcerer? Where the heck did he come from? The plot and characters all seem pointless.

Terminally annoying is the d*mn camera that never sits still, always circling and swooping and crawling on characters -- cinematography for the short attention-span set. A fidgety camera is no substitute for missing dramatic action.",1424822400,,1280,5.052132701421801

1697604,5,B0000640T0,I was never a fan of the Disney cartoon version of Snow White. But I LOVE this movie. It is so magical and mysterious. Its beautifully done and a work of art.,1318118400,,158,3.96875
1697605,5,B0000640T0,"A very good movie, I almost gave it four stars instead of five, trying to be more ""critical"" of the film, but that seemed a bit unfair, not to mention untrue to how much I actually enjoyed the film. Would I say I liked it? Yes. Would I say I loved it? Well, I wouldn't say I didn't (I don't lie). So both is true, thus five stars it is! All the more so since the one of the main reasons I was going to knock off a star was because I think it should have been Snow White on the dvd cover's spine instead of the evil queen. Don't get me wrong, the evil queen is great and all, but the movie isn't called ""Queen Elspeth: fairiest of them all"" now is it? So what the heck's up with her being on the side by herself like that? But it seemed a little petty to take off a star JUST for that, when I loved everything else about both the film, the cover, AND the disc menus.

This movie really is an exellent way to show the classic fairytale on screen, even more so than I remembered from when I first saw it on TV many years ago. It has all the elements of a perfect dark fairy-tale (evil queens with awesome back-stories, scary wish-granters that pop up out of the ice, dwarfs that can create weather and travel anywhere they want as long as they are all together, they even had a fantastic call-back to a much older version of snow white where it was the princess's MOTHER that was trying to kill her, by having the queen magically transform herself into said mother using her mirror) without getting horror-film gory or adult. Major thumbs up there. To flesh it out a bit, the story borrows from an Andersen fairytale, the snow queen, and has mirror bits flying into peoples' eyes. You wouldn't think so, but it fits wonderfully into this version. It explains why the ""huntsman"" is so willing to kill Snow White for the queen and why he changes his mind at the last minute (a tear of guilt at what he's doing washes out the mirror piece). It also borrows from Snow White and Rose Red (the prince turns into a brown bear). And while this might seem like just another way to have people confuse the two very different fairytales, it goes so well with the film that this doesn't really matter.

I've read other reviews saying that the actress that played Snow White did everything from a ""blah"" job, to a terrible one. I didn't find that to be true. I loved the Snow White in this version. She's as afraid of her beauty as the queen is jealous of it, which I think worked better than having her just be a typical ""Tra-la-la"" disney sterotype, singing about when her prince is supposed to show up. In this version, the Prince shows up early on, but up till the last minute before the hunter is supposed to kill her under the queen's orders she more or less just ignores the fact that he likes her (because he doesn't know her) and when she stops ignoring it she tells him that beauty has nothing to do with what's inside. Her relationship with the dwarfs was well-done, too; having one of them be a statue she talked to in the garden, someone who ""saw her life, saw her tears"" was much more emotional than it would have been having her just stumble upon COMPLETE strangers, all the more so since she doesn't stay with them for as long in this version as in some others.

The costumes in this movie were awesome. I lost count of how many times I said, ""I love that dress"" while watching it. At LEAST four or five.

Over-all, this is the best Snow White movie out there that I've had the pleasure of seeing. It's not really for little kids, but there isn't anything particularly shocking in it aside from a couple of scary parts-including one where a ribbon tightens around Snow White's middle until she can't breathe and passes out, and another where the evil queen's brother, a pretty scary-looking dude, all and all, suddenly pops up out of a patch of ice-and it's fine for anyone over the age of 10 or 11 who likes a darker, less ""heigh-ho"" fare in their fantasy-themed movies.",1305072000,2,3971,4.311914323962517

1697633,4,B0000640T0,"The story of Snow White is one of the most famous by the Brothers Grimm, and this version by Hallmark is probably the most recent revision.  It is also the one with the most magic, and is one of Hallmark's better movies.  Snow White this time is born of by the prick of a rose on her mother's finger.  Childbirth kills the mother and sends the father out into the cold winter with his daughter.  Their desperation brings one of Satan's servants to life, who grants the father three wishes (what other number could it be).  The first two wishes turn out well, but the third brings forth Elspeth, i.e. the wicked stepmother.  Baby Snow White senses the evil stepmother immediately by crying when they are about to touch.  What ensues is a lifelong rivalry in which Elspeth uses her magic to slowly take over the kingdom.  This includes her mirror, which can fly.  The seven dwarfs are not all short, but instead they now represent the 7 colors of the rainbow, and hence can travel across distances by ""rainbowing"" themselve.  Animals of various sorts get involved, and the battle climaxes with the poisoned apple.  Elspeth's evil is undone by the love of a prince, and Elspeth herself is taken down by her own evil creations.

The movie is about two hours long, and moves briskly along from one scene to the next.  There is no singing, instead the music is orchestral in the style of classical Romance.  The cinematography is great and the special effects are quite nice and believable.  The overall story is the same as the original Disney version but many of the details have changed to make it quite distinct and unique.  Overall, a good movie.",1162512000,2,1645,4.620689655172414

1697637,2,B0000640T0,"When I first saw this for sale I thought oh wow Miranda Richardson! It has to be good right? Wrong. Miranda was great as the evil queen, but everyone else was horrible! Not even the guy who played Willow could save the day! Let me tell you why it was so bad. The story line starts out great, we've got some weird guy granting wishes to snow whites dad to save her from dying. Miranda as the witch finally becomes beautiful. And the gnomes in the garden really crack me up. But as Snow White grows up she has no substance. Plus the fact that she cant act worth anything does not help to all of her like 10 lines in the movie. The prince can act better than snow white but it's not much of a save. Their romance is too forced. Eventually he turns into a bear anyway so we can see an animal which does a better job of expressing emotions. The digital effects in this movie aren't bad, I mean the mirror flying around was just a little too much though. I wish there was more character development. And then let me get to the dwarves. Naming them for the days of the week? Okay that's just ridiculous. The movie is just very odd. It had a great point to it, don't get me wrong. I felt spoiled after seeing the version of Snow White with Sigorney Weaver in it ""Snow White, A tale of Terror"" This movie was fantastic! It's also way cheaper than buying this version of Snow White which really sucks so bad. I'm very open to fantasy films when they are done right! SO definetly check out Snow White with Sigorney Weaver and the 10th Kingdom. These are WAY better fairytale movies!",1125705600,3,1571,4.24
1697648,3,B0000640T0,"SPOILERS: This is not nearly as bad as it sounds. When you figure that Disney's Snow White is one of the top 50 U.S. films of all time (and the best thing Disney has ever done), you can understand why Hallmark and writer/director Caroline Thompson (who did such a good job on Black Beauty and Edward Scissorhands) would not want to do that version of the fairy tale. And unlike Alice in Wonderland, Snow White is not sacred material; not only has it changed drastically over the past 180+ years, but versions of the basic storyline are present in the folklore of many different countries and languages. The Hallmark version is much closer to the original (and darker) Brothers Grimm story. So the best way to watch this is to put aside any preconceived notions and view it with an open mind.

One thing it has going for it is that the production designer did the usual Hallmark fairy tale magic with the look of the thing. Very nice.

Casting was a little weak. Kristan Kreuk's performance as the title character is feeble; the director should have been able to get a whole lot more from her, but Miranda Richardson as the Evil Queen was wonderful. Fortunately the story is centered around the Queen, and Richardson is able carry the whole film. I don't know if this was by design or was done in post, they may have trimmed a lot of Kreuk's stuff when they realized it was so awful. But at least they worked hard with the lighting and the digital color correction to lighten Kreuk's complexion-she is still not physically believable as Snow White (not even close to lips as red as blood and skin white as the snow) but the disparity is not as bad as expected. And Kruck is such a sterile non-sensuous beauty that she fits the antiseptic way in which the director apparently wanted to under-portray the character.

Vincent Schiavelli who stole the show in ""Ghost"" also steals all the seven dwarf scenes.

Vera Farmiga does a great job as Snow White's mother, especially when she plays the Queen impersonating the mother. In fact, the best scene of the film is when she is trying to convince Snow White to eat the apple-some really great shot framing and editing. Interestingly, in the original story it was the mother (not a step-mother) who was trying to kill Snow White,

The ending is a bit anti-climatic as it almost instantly goes from everything being totally bleak to everything being right with the kingdom. And this happens not because of any action from the heroes or in any sort of suspenseful way, the Queen just undoes herself by reaching too far. While this supports the 'its what's inside each of us that's important' theme, it cheats the viewer out of an interestingly evolving resolution.

If you ignore Kreuk (who became a decent actress-or at least much better than anyone could have guessed from this performance) and prepare yourself for a rather 'nothing' ending, you should enjoy this tale.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1122768000,6,2959,4.657088122605364

The 7 dwarves were funny with their different attitudes about what to do and how to do it.  The Actress who plays Snow White really fits the part she was awesome.  I like when the misguided evil queen goes to the mirror and wants to know who is the fairest of them all and instead of a shadowy ghostly figure popping up and saying that so and so is, the actual person pops out of the mirror.  In the end there is a good moral to the story and through out the story they keep that fact on the front burner it isn't just about some poor girl who is too trusting and ends up needy some prince to come and save her.  It wasn't too scary either it was actually pretty mild in my opinion.  DENFINTLY WORTH WATCHING!!!",1120003200,,829,4.14375

1697651,3,B0000640T0,"Though there are some serious deviations to this new version of the Snow White fairytale, on the whole I enjoyed watching it, especially in terms of its beautiful visual style. As most reviewers have already said, everything in the scenes are bright and colourful, yet ornate and whimsical, giving it a truly fairytale feel. Costumes in particular are lovely whether it be the rainbow outfits of the dwarves or Snow White's own princess-wardrobe.

The story harks back more to the Grimm's fairytale, and so is perhaps not for younger viewers (though kids get very little credit these days - if they can watch the Queen's transformation scene in the Disney version of ""Snow White"", I think they could deal with this). The wood-dwelling couple John and Josephine give birth to a baby daughter according to Jo's wishes when she pricked her finger on a rosebush: a child with hair black as ebony, lips red as blood and skin as white as snow.

However when the difficult birth takes Jo's life, John is forced to leave their home to fetch milk for his daughter. He stumbles through the snow, unable to find the village and only survives when his tears melt the icy prison of the Green-Eyed Granter of Wishes, who grants John three wishes in gratitude. Hardly able to believe the situation, John wishes for milk, a kingdom and his queen. The first two are easy work for the genie, but for John's 'queen', the genie goes to his sister Elspeth, an ugly wench who lives to spread misery over the forest creatures (she has a garden of 'real' garden gnomes!) Transforming her into a beautiful woman she gleefully forces John to fall in love with her through the use of a magic mirror, leaving her with a husband to manipulate, a kingdom to rule, and a stepdaughter to hate...

The movie actually adds quite a lot of components from the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale ""The Snow Queen"", namely the role of the mirror. When Elspeth shatters it, two shards fly into John - one in his eye and one into his heart - the same thing that happens to Kay in Anderson's tale. I suspect many people were confused at the whole mirror sequence if they weren't familiar with this other story, but it is an interesting melding of stories.

Miranda Richardson magnificently plays the role of Elspeth, the evil stepmother and in many ways it is she who is the star of the production. She plays her role with great pizzazz from the twisted, bitter hag to the joyful maiden to the jealous and suspecting wife. Tom Irwin is a little hen-pecked as John, but ultimately we feel more sympathy than scorn for him. Unfortunately Kirstin Kreuk plays Snow White rather stiffly - though she is a perfect casting choice in terms of physical appearance. However, in Kreuk's defence it is one the most difficult things in the world to play virtuous, perfect heroines, simply because they appear rather boring on the screen (especially when surrounded by more fascinating villains). The dwarfs are a little silly (their connection with rainbows makes them look like extras on ""Barney the Dinosaur"") but most will be amused to recognise Warwick Davis (""Willow"").

In keeping in line with the Grimm's story, the movie does include the sash that squeezes the breath out of Snow White as well as the famous apple, but unfortunately not the poisoned comb. Other interesting directions are taken by the movie-makers: instead of an old hag, Elspeth approaches Snow White as her dead mother, and as well as the colours of the rainbow, the dwarfs are named after the days of the week (and include a normal-sized Wednesday). The Prince is given a bit more of a back-story than simply entering at the end (he even gets a name!), but there are some loose ends not quite wrapped up and Elspeth's ultimate fate is a little silly.

Yet overall I enjoyed this movie, if not just for its gorgeous appearance which is made more amazing considering the very small budget for this movie. I watch it just to look at it: the elegant yet simple palace to the quiet, peaceful woodlands; the elaborate costumes, the colourful makeup, the subtle yet beautiful special effects, I could go on...",1112659200,16,4124,4.728789986091794

Personally, I LOVE the story of Snow White, but I've always hated the animated Disney version. THIS version, however, does the REAL story justice. And the characters are all way more complex than many reviewers gave them credit for. The queen isn't really evil evil you know; all she wanted was to be beautiful and accepted. She wanted friends. I'm not saying she wasn't a bad person, but she did have more to her than just pure evil. Same goes for Snow White. She shows a LOT of emotion for someone who grew up virtually alone. And you DO see her warm up some as the dwarves become her family and she learns to socialize with others properly. And the whole dwarves and flying mirrors thing? Have a little imagination- it's called artistic license. It isn't any more unbelievable than having a young woman ""magically"" tranform herself into an old one in order to kill her step-daughter.

1697655,1,B0000640T0,"Simply awful rehashing of Snow White that fails to deliver on all levels. Do not believe the lies: Hallmark's SNOW WHITE - THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL is for children only - and very young ones at that. I was sneakily fooled early on by promotional material and viewer reviews surrounding this film. That is my motivation for posting here. There is nothing at all wrong with making a childish and simple film for children or simple people, but why mislead? If the intent was to make a film for children, then market it as a film for children! So be warned: if you were expecting something reasonably slick and adult, or at least tolerable, in the stratum of, say, SNOW WHITE - A TALE OF TERROR, you will NOT find that here.

Now, to compile all the faults in this shallow, forgettable drivel would exceed the maximum word limit. I will be select and, unlike so many others, honest. Our queen (Miranda Richardson, in a terribly distracting red wig) embarrassingly overacts to the point of a sort of visual suffocation, while Snow White possesses the passion of a mannequin. The male support are apparently irrelevant, dwarves aside (I think there was a king in there somewhere, and a prince). We have a very tall dwarf dressed head-to-toe in yellow (is he wearing a raincoat?), emitting a somewhat perverse vibe. Oh, and our technicolor-clothed dwarves can summon a rainbow (yes, that's right! Still think this is dark?), and beam themselves around the countryside. We have a young bear trotting about for reasons that escape my memory - no, wait, that used to be the prince! We have a flying mirror resembling something from a Barbie play set; you might find better costumes and sets in a traveling pantomime. The landscape appears to be Canadian without any effort to disguise. As with the sets and costumes, cinematography and music are distinctly without magic. I can only sigh at so much unfulfilled potential. LESSON: Even a fairytale requires depth and a modicum of plausibility.

You have been warned. I cannot tell you how terrible I found this film without resorting to profanity, which of course is not allowed here. Stay away, sensible viewers. Stay away.",1096675200,7,2162,4.793565683646112

There are so many touches in this film that just don't even represent what the story is about.  It is not a true enough interpretation to even please little kids, besides the fact that the scenery is beautiful and the music is alright too.  Kristin Kreuk could have been a beautiful Snow White but she is very, very stiff.  One might think that she already took a bite of the poisoned apple (or wished she would have) in the first few moments that we see her onscreen.  Kreuk plays a very depressed Snow White indeed!
Miranda Richardson delivers a fair performance as, not exactly a queen but more like an ugly enchantress transformed by her brother(This character doesn't really seem to have a place in the story, a very odd choice)who is given the throne.  I feel that there are some decent parts in this movie.  But nothing screams Snow White.  Like I said, the scenery is beautiful but this is not a movie for everyone.  You'll either be confused or fall asleep if you are not a big fan of fairy tales or have some knowledge of other tales.  It seems as though there were parts from other grimm stories such as The Bear Prince and Snow White and Rose Red incorporated in the plot of this movie but they really do nothing for the story and were a poor choice.

1697694,2,B0000640T0,"I saw this movie at a friend's house and I had really looked forward to seeing it because 'Snow White' is one of the most amazing ferry tales. There have been many productions of this ferry tale and I thought that maybe this  time they'd take the story in a whole new direction and give it a new meaning. But I must say that I watched the movie and aside from its nice production values and pretty good acting in the parts of the step mom and king, it was an utter disappointment. My major problem is with the script.
  First, events would occur which made little logical sense that the movie did not try to explain, like the use of flying mirrors. Second, I just couldn't get into the gag on the dwarves. Why is one tall, why is one a woman, why are they dressed in rainbow? And if they can control the weather, why can't they save Snow White when she eats the apple? Third, the step mother part was 'dark and evil' and the Snow White part was very sweet but bland and I had trouble really rooting for her, aside from her pretty face. As with every production of this story that I have seen, these two characters were depicted in their cookie cutter roles as 'dark and evil' step mom and 'sweet but boring' Snow White, which I think is a crime because they miss out on a potentially very complicated relationship between Snow White and her step mom.
In conclusion, this is an ok film to entertain older children but if you want to get a new spin on the story, this isn't the movie to see it. At best, check out the Sigourney Weaver version which is at least a lot more passionate, and is much better but also falls short.",1078012800,5,1622,4.242718446601942

I would recommend for those of you seriously interested in a well-done dark version of snow white (that does not include brightly colored dwarfs riding rainbows) to check out ""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"".
""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is much darker and stars Sigourney Weaver as the evil queen; it also in fact has no dwarfs but instead stars a band of miscreants hiding in the woods.  It is very dark and gruesome, and has enough twists to hold your attention throughout the entire movie; on top of that the acting is bewitching.  This movie manages to be romantic, scary, enchanting, and at some points funny.  You connect with the characters and even at some points feel sorry for the evil queen. ""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is by far the best version of snow white that I have ever seen.  Read some of the reviews for the movie and see what others have said about it.  I highly recommend checking it out if you have shown any interest in Snow White "" The Fairest of them All.

1697698,4,B0000640T0,"""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is one of those retellings of a classic fairy tale that is probably going to impress adults more than the kiddies, although you will find some problematic elements in this 2002 television movie.  This version is closer to the original tale told by Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and his brother Wilhelm Carl Grimm, but Caroline Thompson and Julie Hickson's teleplay comes up with some inventive elements, most of which work.  But much as I like the veteran character actor Vincent Schiavelli, a six-foot-five-inch dwarf is a bit of a reach for me.
Anyhow, once upon a time, John (Tom Irwin) and Josephine (Vera Farmiga) were living happily together in the forest when they had a beautiful baby girl then named Snow White.  However, Josephine dies soon after leaving John alone to fend for his baby.  John buries his wife and starts on a journey to find food; at his darkest moment he is about to give up when he happens to awaken a genie known as the Green Eyed One (Clancy Brown), who will grant three wishes aa a reward for his release.  John's first wish is for milk for Snow White.  His second wish is to have his wife back, but this is beyond the Green Eyed One's power.  Instead, he will provide John with a new queen and a kingdom to go with it.  However, what John does not know is that his new queen, Elpseth (Miranda Richardson) is really his own hag of a sister (the crone is played by Karin Konoval), transformed into a beauty.  Snow White crows up to be played by Kristin Kreuk (a.k.a. Lana Lang on ""Smallville"") and when the spell starts to fade and Elpseth's beauty begins to fade, the story takes a dark turn.
""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is a much darker version of the story than the beloved Disney classic, so by no stretch of the imagination is this the first version of Snow White you would want any child to see.  This is a dark version of the tale that takes place in a much more dangerous world, although the entirely reworked dwarf part of the plot (they are now named for the seven days of the week) usually works against the rest of the story.  The sets are beautiful, as are the costumes, and what passes for the magic mirror this time around is pretty spectacular.
A lot of people will check out the DVD version because of Kreuk, who is the WB's new Katie Holmes.  I admit I am one of those people, but even I found it rather odd that her cast bio on the DVD features her Neutrogena commercial.  Anyhow, Kreuk has little to do but sit there and look pretty throughout the movie (she shows a lot more emotion and flair in the commercial).  The one who steals the show is Richardson, which is exactly what you would expect when an actress of that caliber gets a choice role like a wicked queen in a fairy tale.  If there was any doubt about whether this version of Snow White is worth checking out, then it is Richardson who tips the scale in that direction.  ""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is certainly worth a look for those who are interested in new takes (or, in this case, extremely old takes) on classic fairy tales.",1064793600,9,3096,4.395796847635727

I like the days of the week names for the dwarfs and the special effects make this movie very exciting. Kristin Kreuk was the perfect choice to play Snow White. She even looks pretty enough to be a real life Snow White. I'm so glad I happened to catch it the Sunday that it aired on The Wonderful World of Disney.

When I read the description for this movie, I thought I was in for some great storytelling.  I mean, it stars Smallville's very own Kristen Kreuk!  I've never felt so ripped-off in my entire life.
Where to begin with the problems?  First of all, there's some weird genie character who's freed from a frozen lake - yes, a lake - by the tears of Snow White's father.  Don't expect to find out why that genie was put there, just be happy that he's there to move the ""story"" along... and turn the father into a king with a kingdom and a queen.
But get this, this queen is really the genie's just-as-ugly sister who is desperate to be beautiful.  She gets her wish as part of the new king's wish to have a queen, but evidently the king doesn't lover her.  So, to make the king love her - and you're gonna LOVE this one - the genie tells his sister to break her mirror.  She does this, and all of a sudden, it starts raining mirror shards in the garden, where the king is seen running for cover.  Before he can escape, a shard of mirror falls into his eye and now he's head-over-heals for the queen.  Oh and wait till you learn just how long that shard stays in his eye. (I need a laughing smiley here.)
I won't spoil the rest of this waste of technology for you die-hard fantasy fans.  I'll just leave at these cons:
1. The music is lackluster
2. The acting is pathetic. (excluding the guy who played Willow)
3. Snow White herself is pointless.  I just didn't care about her.
4. The mirror changing its mind about beauty is inexplicable and unconvincing.

The mother of Snow White also give a nice acting performance even if we didn't saw her much and also the brother of Elspeth give a very good scary performance, he his so creepy, I had wish to see him more often in this movie.  Snow White performance is so boring, she have no character, she just plain beautiful, she had no charisma.  The father of Snow White gets on my nerves and also the Little men who one include a little woman and a 6 feet tall man get really much on my nerves.  If this movie would have a good Snow White, one who can act and got not just beauty but charisma, that is much more important then beauty and also a good acting perfomance is more important then beauty the movie would have been great and if the little men will only be little men and not the weirds one we saw in this movie.  Because you got the Queen, the atmosphere, you only need at lest a good Snow White and good Little men and the movie will have deserve 5 stars.",1043971200,,1481,4.13588850174216
1697724,1,B0000640T0,"Where to begin with what was wrong with this film. Could it be the doughy, forgettable Prince Charming? The unfunny anachronistic dwarves? (And one of them is 6' tall, which is a joke I still don't get) The screechy, mugfest of a performance by the usually astounding Miranda Richardson? The expressionless, bland and inscrutable Snow White?
Yes, let's start there. Kristin Kreuk is a pretty girl, but it's evident that's the height of her ""talent"". See her on the cover up there? That's when Kristin is best-- when she's in front of a camera that doesn't record sound or motion. Otherwise we get her lispy monotone, her wide, inexpressively bright eyes, her lack of body language... and in this film, it's all under about ten pounds of cakey looking white makeup. Why hire an ethnic actress for the part of Snow White if all you're going to do is put her in whiteface? What on earth was the point of that?
But that's the least of Kreuk's worries. Her acting on Smallville has never been noteworthy, but in this, she's downright offensive. I actually found myself laughing out loud when, during a scene in which the Evil Queen's henchman is poised above her with a dagger raised to kill her, she looks up, face blank, and intones without a hint of inflection, ""Why?"" Yeah, that's what *I'd* do too, hon.
Maybe that's why Richardson's performance seems so overdone by comparison. Next to Snow White and her equally bumbling, tedious father, anyone would appear to be ""over""acting.
Unless you're a 15 year old boy with a massive crush on the lead actress who doesn't mind watching 2 solid hours of mindlessness as long as she's in a few scenes, please spare yourself the torture of this horrible movie. Hallmark should be ashamed of itself.",1041638400,6,1738,4.739273927392739
1697725,4,B0000640T0,"I have very mixed feelings about this particular Brothers Grimm adaptation. First, I must consider that in the past Fairy Tales have been far from mediocre tales about sanity. Often they are warnings about our most inner desires bringing us certain destruction. This movie deals with jealousy and innocence, kindness and evil.

Caroline Thompson has a great concept at work here, but in places the script falls prey to the clich. The acting would have been better if the script had been more mature. They seemed to want to make this for children and I could not help hearing the Barney song in the background of my mind when I saw the rainbow and politically correct admonitions. I was disappointed in her naming the dwarfs after the days of the week. I think the names Disney gave the dwarfs were more interesting and would have given them stronger personalities. The acting would have seemed better if all the characters had been given a much stronger script. Yet, this adaptation seems to be reaching further into the past than Disney ever envisioned.

The salvation is in the creativity with which the story is told. It is visually appealing and once you watch the extras on the DVD you will realize this was a low-budget production.

The mirror is fascinating. Not only are there a variety of mirrors, the mirror is broken at one point and contains magical properties. This mirror then becomes a transporter, video camera and weapon. It is no longer just a ""mirror, mirror on the wall."" The scenes of ""raining glass"" were wonderfully creative along with the sound effects.

The artificiality of some scenes lend themselves to the ""Fairy Tale"" appeal. The very fact that the characters are not completely believable at times gives them a certain freedom to be completely evil or completely good.

Snow White (Kristin Kreuk) is incredibly beautiful, but almost solemn in her awakening to the world. She has an almost gothic appeal. As a baby, she is born into a world where apple blossoms fall from the trees into a pond near her home and red rose bushes almost envelope the cottage. Her father John (Tom Irwin) is desperate to save her life after his wife dies after childbirth and tries to make it to a close village. He almost fails and yet his tears awaken a creature frozen beneath the ice. This bewitched creature is able to fulfill wishes like a genie and gives him three wishes. He also unfortunately has a sister who is not quite so kind.

Even as a baby, Snow White was able to sense evil intentions and disliked her new mother-in-law Elspeth (Miranda Richardson) who is part of the wish-fulfillment plot.

In the original story in German, Snow white is born as a princess. In this adaptation, she inherits her royalty through magical means. When the huntsman is told to kill Snow White the new queen asks for her liver and lungs. In this adaptation parents might not appreciate their young children seeing the queen eating ""what she thinks"" is Snow White's heart.

When the queen finds out Snow White is still alive, she poses as her dead mother instead of a witch. Offering an apple to someone has been known to be a declaration of love or deceit. In this movie, it spells certain death. Snow White is buried in ice instead of a glass coffin.

The queen is not transformed back into her true self until the end of the movie when she is subject to the violence of the ""garden gnomes"" that come to life to seek revenge. In the real story, she dances to her death in a pair of iron slippers which would not have been enjoyable to watch onscreen. The violence of the gnomes is more ""implied.""

This is not a calm, happy movie but does have a happy, yet questionable ending. Would any father let such a young daughter ride away with a prince? I think not. In the real story, Snow White grows into an adult while in the coffin. Her hair is still black as ebony, her lips as red as blood and her skin as white as snow.

This movie does contain some violent content I don't think ""very young"" children should be exposed to although I imagine they might miss some of the implied meanings. This should have been rated PG in some instances in my own mind.

Otherwise, there are elements in this story I really enjoyed, especially the magical elements incorporated into the mirror, castle, roses, forest and the inclusion of various intriguing elements not seen in a Snow White movie to date.

1697726,5,B0000640T0,"Well, Personally I LOVED this movie. The disney version is all happy and games. This version was more in depth of where the characters originated from and gives you details about their version of the Snow White, and that's what i loved about it. kristen kreuk made an amazing acting debut with this movie. I can relate to this movie a lot because to me I am the real life snow white. I have a stepmother who's my father's queen. Mother died when I was younger, Stepmother is completely full of jealousy and envy of me because of the fact that I have looks, and I am younger than her. She does everything in her own power to put me down, and compete with me. And i feel like how snow white feels because all her life she's felt like she was only judged on her looks, and nobody sees what's on the inside, thats how i've felt my whole life.",1038960000,2,838,4.211180124223603
1697727,5,B0000640T0,"The story of ""Snow White,"" by the Brothers Grimm has alwaise been one of my favorites! I recall begging my mother to read it to me all the time when I was little, and my cousin and I often acting out the famous sceen where the evil queen gives Snow White the poisoned apple. The exceptionally wonderful retelling of the story provided much food for thought, and was extremely entertaining. All of the actors/actresses do verry well with the characters they portray, Miranda Richardson deserving a deafening round of applause for her portrayal of the evil queen Elspeth. It requires a lot of acting ability to portray a villain or villainness, and Richardson obviously enjoys her role. I feel both sympathy and anger toward her character, who is twisted in to a monster because she allows her envy to take control resulting in her ruination. I especially liked the dwarfs in this film, because they provided humor and were delightful characters. It may be interesting to note that one of the dwarfs is a girl, and that all of them are named after days of the week. Kristin Krook is verry good in her role of Snow White, showing the human side of the beautiful princess, and portraying her gentle inward beauty as well as her outward. She also does well at showing a vulnerable side to Snow White that is usually not portrayed. I do not neccessarily think this movie is particularly dark, as some have claimed, however it does provide a more indepth study of the darker side of human nature. This is a truly exceptional story of good versus evil, and is truly worth the price. I would recommend that you at least give the movie a chance. Happy viewing!!",1033516800,7,1651,4.638225255972697
1697728,1,B0000640T0,"I didn't like this one. There was a jagged feel to the way the scenes lurches around and the acting--especially the dwarves--was bad enough that I couldn't immerse myself in the story.
However, the imagery was breathtaking. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save the film.",1031616000,,273,5.088888888888889
1697729,1,B0000640T0,"I read about this film before I actually saw it.  The artices on it proclaimed it to be a dark fantasy that brought out the twisted nature of the first written story.  This caught my interest, and along with that, it was written by Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands).  I sat down to watch this expecting something really odd and diferent (or at least moody).  Many laughs later I realized this film was nothing like what it was made up to be.  The opening scene where we find out how Snow white became a princess and where the Queen came from seemed really forced.  I mean reeeaaaly forced.  A genie comes out of the ground and grants her father 3 wishes?  What the Hell was that!!!  That didn't explian anything, it just confused me.  The seven drawfs were the most laughable of characters.  As oppose to the Animated version were the drawfs were named and expressed with feelings, This film tried to make that more grim.  So now they make rainbows, isn't that creepy!  That's far more creepy than having them dig for diamonds!  I know I shuddered when I saw those drawfs with their brightly colored outfits.  Thank God they didn't make Easter egg baskets, and have names like fluffy or puff, I would have screamed! amongst the little drawfs there was (for some odd reason) a very tall dwarf who complained a lot.  This was more anoying than entertaining.  As for the evil queen, she was only 20% as strange as the animated version.  mainly because she looked to much like a suburban house wife misplaced in a fantasy.  And after her whole mirror mirror on the wall scene, I just couldn't take the character seriously.  So if you're afriad junior might be unerved by this, don't worry (unless your child is afriad of such things like Sesame Street, in which case, prepare for therapy when the kids older).  Perhaps they shouldn't have advertised this as being dark, because now it seems like a joke.  As for Caroline Thompson, maybe she wrote this while half asleep.  If you want to see a dark snow white, there's a very good one that was made in the 80's.  The're is singing but the characters were very realistic, and the queen is very freaky.  And the mirror in that film still seems creepy today, with its little faces that decorated the border.  Best thing about that film, no genies to confuse the story.",1030838400,2,2316,4.574209245742092
1697730,4,B0000640T0,"Hallmark may not have a monopoly on dark fairy tales, but they certainly film them in style. This may not be the sugar-coated fantasy flick you remember hearing as a child, or even watching in the old Disney cartoon. This fairy tale is told the way that Grimm would tell it... with dark, sinister elements and fascinating plot twists. The seven dwarves (one of which is a girl) control the weather and are named for the days of the week. One of them is six foot tall. The Evil Queen is actually a hideous half-mortal whose brother, a genie, has given her a chance for happiness by giving her great beauty. The mirror plays a large role in the bewitching of Snow White's father, and Prince Alfred will soon face a challenge of his own.

There's something about the film that appealed to me... probably the darkness of the script, but also its reasoning and humor. I much enjoyed the psychological aspect of 'Snow White.' It's a magnificent retelling with gorgeous cinematography, a memorable score, and above all a magnificent performance by Miranda Richardson. I thought her enthralling as Queen Mab in Merlin; in 'Snow White' she shows us her full potential. I have doubts in Snow White herself, however... either the actress did not give her any passion, or her role was poorly written. Everyone else is just oozing with unique personality and depth, but this Snow White is a bland, brooding heroine with little to contrive interest in her.

What also fascinates me is that they chose to play out the climactic ending with Vera rather than Miranda... but shockingly, it works. She holds up well to the standard set by Richardson in the former scenes, although I did miss our lovely evil stepmother in-between. It's a script that reeks with clever ideas, memorable dialogue, and visual delights. Artisan has gone even beyond its success with The 10th Kingdom in masterful special effects that would put any Hollywood production to shame. The costuming is gorgeous, the sets in keeping with a fairy-tale like Medieval existence, and the cinematography is breathtaking, right from the opening shot to the ending panorama. The writer/director knew what she was doing.

But even gorgeously filmed as it is, you aren't going to want to plunk your little sister down in front of this one unaware. The script is very dark and contains sinister plot twists, frightening circumstances, hideous creatures, and some psychological elements. Preview first.",1027728000,15,2444,4.927184466019417
