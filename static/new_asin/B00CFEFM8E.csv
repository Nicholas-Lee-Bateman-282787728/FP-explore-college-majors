8581271,3,B00CFEFM8E,"You don't often get surprises from Daniel Barenboim. Those of us who have collected recordings since the previous century know what to expect. Picture a bell curve of polish and competence, if not much deep thought or special insight. A performance here or there might come up short, just as one might occasionally strike fire. An instance of the latter happened in November 1991 when Barenboim recorded the Bruckner Fifth Symphony&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-Symphony-No-5-Elatus/dp/B0012EGEH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner : Symphony No. 5 - Elatus</a>&nbsp;with the Berlin Philharmonic. The last few minutes of that CD convinced me Bruckner was a genius and the Fifth Symphony a masterpiece.

And so I made the mistake I just implied not to make about Barenboim when I saw the listing of this Blu-ray -- a June 21, 2010, concert of the Bruckner Fifth with the Staatskapelle Berlin. I expected it to be as outstanding as the CD issued in 1992 by Teldec. Hardly. What we get here is an everyday, ready-to-wear performance that reveals little of the symphony's glories. If I'd noticed this was recorded the day after conductor and orchestra had played the Bruckner Fourth -- and during the week in which the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth were then presented on consecutive days -- I might have known better. All-you-can-eat buffets seldom offer prime rib as an entre.

The Staatskapelle Berlin is a fine group of professionals, accustomed to working night after night in the pit of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, even if it's not considered a ""world-class"" symphonic orchestra like the Berlin Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw or the Vienna Philharmonic. The audio engineers don't do much to help in this case. For example, although Barenboim doubles the horn section to eight members -- and even though the camera operators frequently know when to focus on that section and show the players working hard -- its volume too often seems muffled, veiled behind an invisible screen. The principal clarinet, on the other hand, apparently gets his own personal microphone, and it's turned up way too loud. Eight horns ought to be able to blow away one clarinet, but ...

What disappoints more than the occasional mishap -- the oboes' intonation difficulty at 11:41 (measure 143 in the first movement, before one of the grand pauses), the electronic whine at the end of the third movement that sounds like a paper edge scraped over metal -- is Barenboim's casual attitude on the podium. He just sort of starts the engine and lets the machine run. Worse is his demeanor in the Scherzo, whose cosmic waltz sections could have been more appropriate (if less widely recognized) than the Blue Danube in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Going beyond the merely casual, however, Barenboim flaps his arms around and sways like a drunken, half-wit village peasant with a hint of leer in his eyes, reinforcing -- consciously or not -- the inaccurate, stereotypical image of Bruckner as a simple-minded country bumpkin. In the Adagio, Barenboim once directs with the handkerchief he's holding in his left hand. Sometimes he leaves that hand in his pants pocket. If you're looking for the intense concentration of Celibidache on the podium in Munich in 1985&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergiu-Celibidache/dp/B007WB5DFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergiu Celibidache</a>, you won't see it here. The audio quality of that 1985 DVD also happens to be superior to this 2010 Blu-ray's.

The one failing of Barenboim's 1991 recording that keeps it from joining the top Bruckner Fifths of all time -- Celibidache's, Karajan's 1976 studio recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-Symphony-No-5/dp/B00H9N3E18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner: Symphony No. 5</a>&nbsp;in its 2014 single-disc Japanese SHM-CD issue, Eugene Jochum's last 1986 concert&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bruckner-Symphony-No-5/dp/B001FRNONM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.

How dispiriting, then, that the Adagio here clocks in at an even faster 14:17.

At what should be the symphony's blazing conclusion, there's a lot of noise, but no transcendence. This Bruckner Fifth offers no sense of occasion, no uplifting of the soul, no rocket to the heavens -- such as Christian Thielemann delivers in his Blu-ray recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-Symphony-No-5-Blu-ray/dp/B00NBU45W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner: Symphony No. 5 [Blu-ray</a>] from Dresden.

8581272,5,B00CFEFM8E,"This is an awesome blu-ray, great music, wonderful performance, I bought Symphony No. 6 in this series and loved it!
Loved it so much I ordered Nos. 5, 7, 8, and 9 to get all the Mature Bruckner Symphonies.  No. 5 is great too!!!!
The audio quality is AWESOME and just makes you love having these performances.  AND the picture quality is so great you can see everything, Mr. Barenboim, comb your hair!!!  Sorry, joking, he is a MASTER!!!!!  Conducts each and every symphony from start to finish by memory!!!!!  No sheet music for this genius conductor.
Seriously, this venue is BEAUTIFUL and sounds that way too.  I am becoming a big fan of the Staatskapelle Berlin.  WOW they are so good.
This blu-ray will not really test your audio system, but a good system will allow you to enjoy it to its fullest.  There is not a big dynamic range, they do play quietly and they can rock, but not take the roof off loud.  BUT SOOOO MUSICAL all the way through.
You will not regret buying Sym. 5 here nor Sym. 6 in this series.
God Bless, Wayne",1445212800,,1034,4.4
8581273,5,B00CFEFM8E,"Daniel Barenboim was not someone I would have considered a Bruckner specialist, but I'm finding out there's nothing he can't do well.  He surprised me with the depth of his interpretation of this monumental work.  Good job.  The picture and recorded sound are very good.  This is a disc I will probably watch repeatedly - very satisfying.",1399334400,,338,4.87719298245614
8581274,5,B00CFEFM8E,"Great performance from a great sounding orchestra.
Have Abbado and liked it.
love this one.
one of my favorite symphonies.",1396310400,,122,5.15
8581275,5,B00CFEFM8E,"When this series debuted, I complained about the pricing of these blurays, $35 for about an hour's content. That was Bruckner #4, which I subsequently bought for about $20. This follow-up (#5) was priced realistically at about $20 on its initial release, so perhaps Amazon and Accentus listened. Or maybe market forces prevailed.. Whatever - it's all good.

What's especially good is this performance. It is, in my opinion,superior in every way to the Abbado, released some time ago. For a start, it's much more cohesive - less episodic. Gerhard Knapp, in his excellent review of this disc, talks about Abbado's timidity. I agree, but there's an overwhelming ""sound"" in this Barenboim version that points to one thing - the reverberation times in the Berlin venue are perfect for Bruckner's so-called ""cathedral of sound"". This brass attack is something to behold. The Lucerne hall that Abbado used just doesn't provide  that enveloping quality needed in this music. Using a good surround sound set-up, this performance will blow you away! The coda in the finale is sonically crushing.

I'm not going to repeat Mr. Knapp's appraisal of this disc, but rather say that I echo his sentiments in every instance.

The next item in this series has just been released (#6) also at the $20 mark. I've seen bits of it on YouTube and since I 'm a connoisseur of the sixth symphony (my favorite Bruckner symphony for over 50 years!) I can tell you this is a must-buy also.

But in the meantime, buy THIS disc!",1390953600,6,1498,4.8359375
8581276,5,B00CFEFM8E,"If I were to be banished to the proverbial desert island and could only take along a dozen recordings, this would be one of them. On the heels of a somewhat routine Fourth in his series of Mature Bruckner Symphonies, Daniel Barenboim and his Staatskapelle Berlin pull out all the stops to give us an absolutely stellar Fifth. This was recorded live in great audio and video  excellent camera work invariably in sync with the score as we can expect from Accentus  at the Philharmonie Berlin on 21 June 2010. Once more, in terms of their virtuosity, refinement, splendor and sheer power, the Staatskapelle musicians demonstrate that they are one of a handful of leading orchestras in todays world. Ensemble, group and solo work are stupendous. The musicians are visibly in tune with their music director, evoking several of his rare smiles. Barenboim conducts the 71-minutes colossal symphony without a score: a rare feat indeed given the many quasi-repetitions and dynamic or voice shifts within the same thematic material. As far as I can determine without a score, the version performed here (original version of 1878) does not appear to be significantly different from the Novak edition used by other conductors.

From the measured introduction and the epic, monumental development of the first movement through the intimate, sublime beauty of the Adagio  Barenboim takes it slow as indicated, but never too slow and dirge-like  and the quirky, brilliant Scherzo with its biting accents to the glorious finale with its enormous contrapuntal fugue, this reading will grip you and not let go until the triumphant final bars.  Every note, every shift in mood and dynamics is done right, and the whole structure with its self-referential quotations and allusions remains present every moment. This is not only an inspired, but a highly concentrated reading that reveals the conflicting two souls within Bruckners symphonic cosmos: the devotional striving toward metaphysical peace and the fear of death and nothingness. It is the clash of these forces that accounts for the proto-modern character of Bruckners music, for its abrupt shifts in harmony and rhythm, its sharp, dissonant edges and disquieting silences. Barenboim often lets the silence speak between notes. He also doubles the timpani at the end of the first and third movement and in the finale to good effect: they are not drowned by the massed brass (as can be heard in other recordings) and thus the finale ends in overwhelming grandeur.

This is my version of choice on DVD, a companion piece to Franz Welser-M&ouml;sts (Euroarts, 2007) different, but equally moving recording (in the acoustically problematic Stiftsbasilika St. Florian, Linz). The late Claudio Abbados quite special, but rather genteel reading (Accentus 2012) in my opinion does not come to grips with the symphonys chilling subtext.",1390435200,6,2866,5.190476190476191
