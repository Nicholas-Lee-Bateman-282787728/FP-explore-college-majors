397221,4,6301967690,"In the normal scheme of things, lofty MGM wouldn't have touched John O'Hara's novel with a ten foot pole--but shortly before her contract was to end, MGM star Elizabeth Taylor besmirched her image by running off with Debbie Reynolds' husband Eddie Fisher.  With her reputation in shreds and one foot outside the studio gate any way, MGM decided to capitalize on the bad press by casting Taylor as BUTTERFIELD 8's bad-girl-from-hell... and then, to add insult to injury, tucked Eddie Fisher into a supporting role and cast Debbie Reynolds look-alike Susan Oliver in the role of Eddie's girl friend, who feels threatened by Liz's manhungry ways.  Liz fought the project tooth and nail, but MGM was adamant: she owed them another film, and she wasn't leaving until she made it.

BUTTERFIELD 8 is the story of Gloria Wandrous (Taylor), a hard-drinking, sexed-up, bed-hopping dress model who gets her kicks by seducing and then dumping men according to whim--until she encounters an unhappily married man just as hard and disillusioned as she in Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey.)  Although the production code was still somewhat in force, it had loosened up quite a bit since the days of NATIONAL VELVET, and while scenes stop short at the bedroom door they have plenty of sizzle while they walk up to it; moreover, every one in the film talks about sex so much you'd think it had just been invented.  Taylor is on record saying that she considers the film a piece of trash, and she swears she has never actually seen it, that she would rather die than ever see it.

But something weird happened as the camera rolled.  Taylor, doubtlessly driven by her fury at having to do the movie, gives a throw-away, over-the-top performance--but perversely, this is precisely what the role requires, and her performance was successful enough to earn her an Oscar.  The supporting cast follows her lead, all of them performing in broad colors and bigger-than-life emotions, and again they too are quite successful, with Laurence Harvey and Dina Merrill (as his long suffering wife) particularly effective. Ultimately, of course, Elizabeth Taylor is quite right when she says the film is a piece of trash.  But it is the best kind of trash because it is so completely trashy: BUTTERFIELD 8 doesn't just dive into the trash pile, it wallows in it with considerable conviction.  Modern films of the same type may show more skin and more sex, but for sheer authority BUTTERFIELD 8 remains a standard against which most of them pale.  Not every one will like it, but I recommend it all the same.

397222,5,6301967690,"Elizabeth Taylor won an academy award for this film back in 1960. Yes, she's a good actress. But it was also politically correct at the time to have her win because she was just recovering from an illness. She was at the peak of her physical attractiveness then, and she sure did look good. I'll never forget the first scene where she wakes up alone in the luxurious apartment of a wealthy married man, played by Laurence Harvey, parades around in a slip and high heels and walks off with his wife's mink coat. Later, they embark on a hot romance which ends tragically, but not before Liz gets to wear some gorgeous outfits and have a few scenes with Eddie Fisher, her real-life boyfriend at the time, cast as her platonic friend. The story had to conform to Hollywood's moral code and yet there are some scenes that just sizzle. It held my interest throughout. And the characters came across as real people, avoiding the pitfall of stereotypes. I enjoyed it completely. Recommended.",1013212800,3,983,4.655172413793103
397223,3,6301967690,"When Elizabeth Taylor says that to her mom, she gets a slap in the face. But that's okay: this is one of those ""torn from today's headlines"" kind of movie where things like that are commonplace. Liz plays Gloria Wandruss, a wild sex kitten who  may or may not be a call girl. I mean, why is the movie named after a phone number otherwise? Yet Liz gets steamed when Laurence Harvy leaves her money after their night together, so steamed that she uses her lipstick to scrawl across the living room mirror, ""No Sale!"" Wow, is this trash or what?  Yes, ""Butterfield 8"" is a type of trash movie, in spite of its garnering Liz an Oscar. Why trash? There's a lot of meaningless sexy talk between everyone imaginable, for one thing. Another thing is the terrible acting of Laurence Harvey--he comes across as a sicko and I'm not sure that's where they were going with this one. He has the requisite long-suffering wife, Dina Merrill; not much to say about her performance--she knows that for some reason he's troubled, but she expects him to find himself one day.  Really bad too is Liz's real-life husband of the year, Eddie Fisher, as her childhood friend who may or may not be in love with her. She keeps going over to his apartment and annoying him as he tries to compose music at his piano. From time to time his angry girlfriend Susan Oliver stops in to say jealousy-tinged things to Liz. I couldn't help but notice that Susan Oliver's hair and clothing style are suspiciously familiar--hey, she looks like Debbie Reynolds!  I wonder why.  I understand the original book by John O'Hara has the sexy Gloria leave her lover's apartment wearing nothing but a mink coat she ""borrows"" from his wife's closet, because during their wild night he ripped her dress off her body.  Well, Hollywood allowed us to see the ripped dress on the floor, but Liz traipses around Laurence Harvey's apartment in her tight tight slip and spike heels before heading out under the mink. What I'd like to know is, If he was so passionate that he ripped her dress, why is this tight slip intact? Seems to me that something that form hugging would have offered more protection than a chastity belt.  ""Butterfield 8"" is not a fine film, but it does offer us much in the way of humor, however inadvertently. If you're the sort of person who likes to talk back to the screen trying to top your friends with additional dialogue, then this is one movie you ought not miss.",995673600,5,2438,4.552511415525114
397224,5,6301967690,"Butterfield 8 makes other films in this genre superfluous. Elizabeth Taylor is ravashing and funny and dramatic all the way through it. Laurence Harvey gets a good going over here from Liz, as she pushes her high heel into his shoe while they sit at a bar.

397316,3,6301967690,"No question in his day, the time from the late 1920s with the acclaimed Appointment At Samarra until the 1950s anyway, the novelist John OHara had the fun, foibles, loves, and craziness of the upper classes of the day down pat. Not the high-end Rockefeller clannish types but that level just below, the strivers of Wall Street and industry. Since that time though his star has been eclipsed as literary fashions have changed and he has been relegated to the dead white guy pile. But for a slice of life about how the other half lived (the other half not born on the wrong side of the tracks), what made them tick and how they tumbled down the hill in the middle third of the 20th century you could find no better interpreter. Not bad for a kid from Pottsville, Pa.

Which brings us to the film adaptation of his 1934 novel Butterfield 8 updated to the late 1950s from the look of the automobiles on the streets. But updated or not the story line is the same. The strivings of a from hunger woman, Gloria played by then I think the reigning Hollywood beauty queen Elizabeth Taylor, to get out from under the best way she could using her beauty to match up with well-funded gentleman callers. In the argot of the time she was a party girl, a call girl for whoever paid the freight through the escort service Butterfield 8 which gives the book and film its title.

Of course those who can pay the freight and who are feeling frisky or lonesome for a serious sexy companion are guys who are married and feeling trapped. That is the case with the main gentleman caller here, Wes, played by Laurence Harvey. He is a from hunger guy who landed on his feet by marrying a factory owners daughter. And like most from hunger guys was made to go through hoops just to keep up appearances without any real power (or much to do except hit the bars and chase Gloria). So we witness what started out as a short-haul tryst complete with cash left on the mantle which moved onto a steamed up romance between the two. Gloria finally decides that despite her great sexual appeal, her flirty life of the party ways, and her ability to make guys come hither with a look (or go into deep freeze when she is done with a guy) she has found love.

Like a lot of OHaras many novels there is a tragic ending here not long after Gloria has her epiphany. The couple had a serious spat over Glorias continued flirting. Wes crosses some line that could never be taken back despite his willingness to divorce his rich wife and take his chances out on the streets. In the end although Wes would not give her up Gloria flees and he followed in a high speed chase-she is fatally injured and he heads back to find himself and see if he can salvage his marriage. This melodrama is done is typical early 1960s style where Gloria profession is left unstated and only revealed by innuendo unlike today where the whole thing would be more openly stated. A fair film and period piece.",1482796800,,2941,4.4025735294117645

397505,4,6301967690,"A strikingly beautiful and sometimes blowsy Liz Taylor plays ""the slut of all time"" Gloria Wandrous in a sordid tale about a call girl who falls in love.

Based on the book written in the 30s but produced and staged in the freewheeling cocktail age of NY in the early 60s, compelling language and acidic repartee among the cast of mostly self loathing urban and urbane characters and morphs into melodrama around an impossible romance.

Eddie Fisher, Liz's actual husband at the time, does a nice turn as her long suffering enabler; they were street kids together and he can't turn his back on her on spite of her destructive ways and the jealousy of his own girlfriend. His platonic allegiance to her is self defeating but touching, it's the most interesting relationship here and the chemistry is good. Laurence Harvey is a bit of a stiff as the object of her affection but he does manage to spew rage and disgust at Gloria's bed-hopping ways in a most convincing manner.  It gets real ugly real fast once the romance begins to unravel.  Poor Gloria, ""like catnip to every cat in town"", can't find happiness and must get her come-uppance by the morality tale standards of the day.

Nice look at some period NY night life and beautifully filmed. There are many who say its ""shocking"" morality is dated, but I can't help feel that the standards of dialogue writing, though sometimes corny, were far richer when this was made than they are today. Check it out for glimpses into damaged psyches in the fast paced early 60s, sharp dialogue, and for Elizabeth Taylor's strong and risky performance.",1416700800,7,1594,4.719424460431655

397550,3,6301967690,"Elizabeth Taylor won an Academy Award for her performance as the wild Gloria Wandrous (wandering? wondrous? both?) in this movie, and it does get off to a good start -- the scene of her waking up in the strange bedroom, drinking, looking for a cigarette butt, stealing the coat, and writing on the mirror is all very arresting, and she looks fetching in the camisole too!  But as soon as characters start to speak and interact, we're in trouble.  The script has tonal problems, and the serious and the humorous (Gloria's mother's friend) aren't well matched, but worst of all is the lack of chemistry between Taylor and Laurence Harvey.  Both Taylor and Harvey can act and have done well in other movies, but they seem not credible here.  It might be that they can't bring a dull script to life, but whatever . . . it doesn't work.

The premise for the story is more interesting than the movie itself.  Two transgressive characters, played by Harvey and Taylor. seem totally unsympathetic at first, but as the movie goes on, we come to learn that behind their bad behavior lie causes and choices that have made them come to a point of despising themselves.  In Gloria's case, the source of her promiscuity lies in events beyond her control; Weston Liggett, Harvey's character, has made a bad choice and has come to realize that the life he has chosen is wrong for him -- basically, he married for security, a job in his wife's father's company.  Each of them struggles to become a better person, and as the movie progresses and we realize that, they win our sympathy to some extent.  If only they acted as if the believed in what they were doing!

The ending is melodramatic and unnecessary.  One wonders if the makers of the film felt that in 1960 a woman like Gloria had to be punished in some way for stepping outside the societal norms?  Since her bad behavior is rooted in an earlier trauma, one might have thought that a different ending was possible -- and I don't mean a ""happy-ever-after"" one, just one that showed us Gloria with a chance of turning her life around, which she seems to be on the point of doing before the car chase (I'm trying to avoid spoilers, obviously!).  I come back to the lack of chemistry, though -- I've read that Taylor didn't want to do the movie but was contractually obligated.

397602,5,6301967690,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, especially of LT's. Could she have been more gorgeous? I mean!

This is such an under-rated film! I don't know why. The acting is very subtle and realistic, there isn't a whole lot of action or special effects or anything crazy going on, so I guess it's not exciting enough for modern audiences who are used to excess. I frequently hear that the acting is 'wooden' for them or that the movie is 'boring'. I could not disagree more.

Elizabeth Taylor is amazing. This role done by anyone else then or now would have made the movie into just another picture. Elizabeth Taylor's acting made this a classic. I loved it!

I felt like I could identify with every single character, especially Gloria. I could even identify with Ligget's wife and Steve's girlfriend.

In a way the ending scene is a little anti-climatic, in the way that you kind of never know what might have happened and I didn't feel resolved in the end... but isn't that the way life is sometimes? I think the point was to leave it up to the viewer's interpretation. Which is so frustrating... but if you don't get frustrated then you weren't emotionally involved. If you didn't emotionally involved, then it wasn't a good movie.

I think some of the viewers who have given this a bad rating have not seen enough of Elizabeth Taylor's films, for one, and also aren't understanding the views about women and sex at the time or how this was a provocative piece at the time in which is was made. Now we see sex sex sex sex sex all over the place and people don't care for subtle. Apparently subtle acting is ""wooden"" now, since people don't throw themselves all over the screen like actors do these days. Acting isn't being the loudest and most emo person in the room, its about real emotions. I think this film delivers.",1394236800,,1824,4.515151515151516

The music is wonderful and so sleazy and sexy it practically has sex with itself.  The men are the most disgusting thing about this film.  They don't mind using a call girl, but once the fun is over they look down on her, would NEVER introduce the woman to their wives and think they themselves are the epitome of virtue.  Sadly, that attitude still exists today.  Taylor's character does not help her own situation by following that belief herself.  Still, a good companion to THE APARTMENT.

I love watching films from old New York City, and Taylor is taking us all around the town, so luxurious and extravagant.. Showing us is not really what we think. What we hear about is not really how it is. Struggling and putting on a faade is a better show of reality, right?

Although much has been said and written about her destructive living (in real life), it is also well known that when she was a friend, she was truly a genuine friend. She loved deeply and passionately, but was much more than a ""thing"" of beauty and decoration. Her acting spoke for itself, although many have allowed her beauty to overshadow her ability to say much even with a few words. It is interesting, too, to observe her fullness of figure, and compare that to today's actresses who want total firmness in arms, legs, shoulders -- Elizabeth's figure was real, and to me (an old man) it spoke volumes in sexuality and splendor not equalled today. I was quite saddened to see the last images of her shortly before her death, but it was obvious that age had taken hold -- as is the course of nature. She herself said that she never liked to watch herself on film and did not like her voice or anything about herself. We are much the richer, however, that others did. I think, though, that she was truly a sad individual. I always wanted to say something to her, but was never allowed that opportunity. She always struck me as someone who needed just an understanding touch of one's hand, to make her know that she was not really unlike so many more who are imperfect but still adored. Truly, there was something uniquely special about her.",1377388800,,1486,4.548507462686567

It's a gorgeous, haunting masterpiece where we see a woman of extraordinary beauty and charisma dressed in knockout fashions by Helen Rose, her hair done by her favorite stylist, Sidney Guilaroff, and ravishing lighting, camerawork, a masterful script and stunning locales and dcor.
Although MGM was ""forcing"" her to make this juicy drama before she could make ""Cleopatra,"" they certainly wanted her to go out in style. They gave her everything she wanted, including Eddie Fisher, as her boyfriend. Contrary to movie historians, Fisher wasn't half bad and came across effectively.
They hired the best supporting actors in the business to give gravitas to the often dark mood. The wonderful Mildred Dunnock portrayed the child-like and wimpy mother. The great Betty Field came on as the bitchy but sardonic neighbor who had audiences roaring with her put-downs. Dina Merrill was another big asset and of course Laurence Harvey was the vicious/sexy Leggit, who couldn't get Gloria out of her system.

This film is based upon a true story of a call girl named STARR FAITHFULL.  All though it was written by John O'Hara in 1935, as a novel, it was a shock to find out that this was a true story. Taylor and Lawrence Harvey were A* in their performances.  Elizabeth was really riveting, especially since, SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER, her last film, at that time(1959). Betty Field, Mildred Dunnick and Dina Merrill were excellent as supporting Elizabeth's acting, but the true surprise was EDDIE FISHER!  As Steve, Fisher truly proved that he was more than a song and dance man.  Susan Oliver was great as Fisher's girlfriend.  An added note:  the film was shot near my home town of Valley Cottage, NY.

397705,4,6301967690,"It may be because of Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar for this film that it remains an important work.  Taylor's performance as Gloria Wandrous is very strong as she goes from the heights of romantic bliss and peace to the depths of despair and shame.  It was a demanding role; and played to Taylor's strengths.  That the film capitalizes on her beauty is reflected in her awakening at the beginning in the film without evidence of a hangover on her face, makeup perfect and every hair in place.  The film also won an Oscar for cinematography.

It is a fair criticism that the film is dated; but to expect that it wouldn't be after 50 years is unrealistic.  I love John O'Hara's work, although he wasn't regarded overly highly in literary circles, perhaps for his willingness to explore basic desires.  The hole in the screenplay comes as a communication error where Weston believes Gloria has stolen a coat.  With a bit stronger communication skill set, she could have explained her dressed was ripped and she needed to cover up.  I could imagine alternative scenarios about sending it off to the cleaners or something that would not have led to the burning conclusion.  So that aspect of the writing plays as a bit contrived.

Laurence Harvey's performance as Weston Liggett was good.  At times it seems a bit stagey compared to trailblazers of the era like Marlon Brando.  But Harvey has the good looks and convincingly plays a guy with a chip on his shoulder despite his good fortune.  Of the other supporting players, Mildred Dunnock as Gloria's mother does a particularly good job as the wimpy mom whose parental permissiveness has consequences.  Eddie Fisher, Dina Merrill and Susan Oliver did strong work, but the characters are rather flat and the performances don't sparkle next to Taylor.

Overall, ""Butterfield 8"" is a film well worth watching for Elizabeth Taylor's star power and acting chops.  Enjoy!",1321401600,,1907,4.872670807453416

397707,4,6301967690,"Ok, so I saw this film several years ago...in fact a LOT of years ago.  I was young, impressionable and I thought Ms. Taylor was the most beautiful woman on earth and this was the best movie I'd ever seen.  Fast forward to 2010. I could hardly wait to get the DVD. Well, sadly for me, the movie had lost a lot of it's previous luster. The storyline was so inept and predictable.  Bad girl wants to change her bad ways and become a respectable wife and live happily ever-after.  Too bad it's with someone else's husband.  Not that the husband is happy in his boring, sterile marriage.  The script is bad.  Gloria Wandrous...wait a minute...Wandrous did you say?  Like in 'wander'?  Yes, certainly... as Gloria wanders from party to party and man to man.  She is a high-paid call/party girl and Butterfield 8, her answering service, is the means by which her 'clients' connect to her. She is seen hopping from nightclub to nightclub, being lifted by several 'clients'  to the bar counter, smiling for the camera while pouring drinks for the lot. She is dressed to kill in a sexy little black number with white pearls.

The one thing that stands out in this tragic tale is that nobody is happy.  Gloria's mother (Mildred Dunnock) is in total denial about the line of work her daughter is involved in.  She thinks Gloria is a model. But, come on! Mother must know something is going on since the only people that ever call Butterfield 8 are men.  So mom worries about Gloria and goes around with a cloud of doom hanging over her head. She isn't happy. Weston Ligget (Laurence Harvey), the man Gloria falls for, is not a happy camper in his high-society marriage to a cool, aloof ice princess.  Of course Emily (Dina Merrill), his wife isn't happy when she discovers his infidelities, though she tries to hide it under a cool facade of patience.  Then there's Steve (Eddie Fisher), Gloria's long time friend. You can't really tell what Steve is feeling since Eddie's performance is so weak and so-o-o bad.  He comes off like a mama's boy. Too soft-spoken, too conforming to whatever situation he may find himself in. Steve's girlfriend, Norma (Susan Oliver), isn't happy that Gloria seems to be always hanging around Steve's apartment everytime she visits. It's a tale of gloom and doom for all except for the happy 'clients' when Gloria is around.  You get this gut feeling that something bad is bound to happen. Especially when a happy Gloria goes to her psychiatrist and tells him she doesn't need him anymore because she is in love.  That feeling is cemented further when she voices the same sentiment to her mother.  Then the feeling really takes root when a drunken Liggett insults her and treats her roughly in public. At that point, you know there is no recovery. Finally, the total letdown when you're proven right. Leaves a bitter taste, but hey, you knew it was coming...so predictable!

There are a few scenes that are worthwhile...Like Gloria brushing her teeth with scotch the morning after;  The sarcastic exchanges between Gloria and her mother's friend; Gloria standing motionless as Liggett throws the mink coat at her while his wife is looking undetected from the window above.  All in all it was a fun film....predictable, but fun because Ms. Taylor came across as the outstanding actor that she was. The one true constant that remained from seeing the movie years ago and now - was Liz's unchanging beauty.  She still looked as beautiful as I remembered when I first saw the film.

Movies are an art form, that is unless you're into documentaries.  Art emits emotions and feelings: like disgust, intrigue, lust, pain and pity.  Great art also comes from great artists and Elizabeth Taylor is one of the greatest.  I have to admit I had prurient expectations going in- just look at the cover, for god's sake!

This movie dealt with a different moral code of the time and Mrs Taylor was brave to take on the issues. Understanding the underdog and making them look in a positive light from a different perspective is something Elizabeth Taylor did in her life too. It seems to be the niche' she played in many of her movies too.  I just can't think of another actress today that could have done this role as good as she did.

Although I've always loved Elizabeth Taylor in all her movies, I believe Butterfield 8 is my very favorite. Here, she was at the zenith of her beauty - My opinion - I never thought her more beautiful and talented. And her acting, of course, was nothing less the superb. She is and always has been one of my favorite actors. Definitely five stars. I'd give it ten if I could.

As the promiscuous model that finally fell in love, Taylor was the best thing in the dated, overly melodramatic, often ridiculous movie that was adapted from the John O'Hara's novel (written in 1935). I did not read ""Butterfield 8"" but I can't believe that the author of ""Appointment in Samarra, and ""The Lockwood Concern"" wrote the stuff the cheap soap-operas are made of. Liz was big and she deserved her first Oscar but there are so many bad things about the movie - uninteresting characters, uninspired acting by the male protagonists, horrible irritating musical score - just a few of them.

Of course, this DVD release was manufactured in 2000, and 7 years later, we are not often given a choice. If 'Gone With The Wind' can (and is) a full-screen presentation, please do NOT insist that, say,'Valley of The Dolls'-- a guilty pleasure if ever one existed--MUST be available ONLY in letterbox since its release last year-- it ruined an otherwise lovely retro 60's style deluxe DVD issue of it.

THANK YOU, WARNER HOME VIDEO for titles such as 'Butterfield 8' that you offer with both Fullscreen and Widescreen versions available.

Oh, and though I am in the minority, for me Ms. Taylor's performance was even better here, more nuanced, in 'Butterfield 8' than in 'Virginia Woolf'- her 2 Oscar performances. ""Butterfield"" may be glossy and a tad trashy, but her performance elevates it to ACADEMY AWARD gloss 'n trash :)

(Very good supporting performances here also by the catty friend of the mother of Taylor's character 'Gloria', ditto Dina Merrill; with Eddie Fisher just fine as Gloria's ex-stepbrother, or whatever he is.

397824,4,6301967690,"Liz would seem to have been ideal casting for the role of a defiant call girl, but she didn't like the part: ""The role they want me to play is little better than a prostitute,"" she protested... Most actresses would enjoy the chance to play a B-girl, but Liz never coveted the showy roles, she never played whores or drunks or nuns or aspiring actresses... Her audience wanted to see her in sensational roles, but she preferred being proper...

Rewritten, the edge taken off, John O'Hara's Gloria Wandrous emerges somewhat undefined... The movie is so cautious that it's never clear exactly how the girl makes her living... She models, apparently, but does she get paid for sleeping with men, or does she sleep with men simply because she likes to?

At the height of a family argument, Gloria confesses to her mother that she was the slut of all time, but there is no evidence of this on screen... As in ""The Last Time I Saw Paris,"" Liz--as girl-about-town--is pallid, almost prissy... She doesn't have the freedom to portray amoral characters... She doesn't have the manic self-destructiveness the part requires... The script makes the character another of Taylor's tragic roles: Gloria Wandrous is a woman, mistreated by her man, who dies of unrequited love...

Like the conception of its heroine, the movie is infected with an enervating morality: once a sinner, the message goes, always a sinner... Deep down, this MGM Gloria feels that her indelible history of nights on the town has disqualified her for the likes of a respectable man... Self-convicted as a bad girl, she knows she's doomed... Much more than the novel, the film emphasizes Gloria's lust for respectability... Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey), the wealthy Yale man, is her one big chance for graduation to the classy life of yachts and weekends in the country... It's as if the character wants to enter the world a younger Taylor so ably embodied in ""A Place in the Sun."" O'Hara's tough, precise, lovingly detailed novel has been transformed into Metro soap, a lament about a sort of hooker with a persistent desire for suburbia...

But there are moments: the wordless opening scene, Gloria stained and rumpled after a night with Liggett; Gloria trading cracks with her mother's sardonic friend, and with her best friend's girlfriend; Gloria convulsed in tears during an argument with her meek mother (Mildred Dunnock).

Taylor and Laurence Harvey mix like oil and water, but her scenes with Eddie Fisher, who plays her platonic, disapproving buddy are strongly build... Eddie gives her quiet support, the way Montgomery Clift always gave her strength on screen...

Her big scene is her confession to Eddie about how she got started in the life: she was seduced by a house guest when she was thirteen, and she liked it (very wide-eyed, very high-pitched and piercing here), she has always 'liked' it! The confession scene is a Taylor trademark during this period: in ""Raintree County,"" ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Suddenly, Last Summer,"" and here, confessions dramatically lit and photographed are the local points of her performances...

Liz gets the character's self-pity, her sentimentality, her loneliness; she can do the smart answers, the head lifted in defiance... She plays, in short, with an authority that had deepened since ""Giant."" In ""Butterfield 8,"" she dominates the way a star is supposed to dominate even if, finally, the role lacks definition...",1166745600,7,3432,5.010526315789473

Maybe. Was this film really worthy of an Oscar? That's debatable but I think Elizabeth Taylor did deserve a heads-up for her portay of Gloria. In another actress's hands this movie could have turned into a disaster but Liz somehow manages to pull it off. Chronicling the life of a call-girl was a risky subject for a major motion picture in 1960. One thing's for sure: this movie is not boring. It will have the viewer hooked from the first minute, wanting to know what will happen next. What is most pleasant about the movie is it does not have a happy ending, which would have made a somewhat cheesy film even cheesier. I enjoy watching movies where the characters are flawed and the undertones are dark and sinister.

It is a moral play.  The moral is that bad girls get bad things happen to them.  The moral is that promiscuous sex is bad.  Gee.  America in 1960.  Bad girls can't get married.  The only thing for a bad girl to do is drive off a cliff and die, so keep those legs together, girls.

The writing is so bad it's funny.  It is like The Seagull by Chekhov, a really bad melodrama.  A loves B.  B loves C.  Chekhov labeled The Seagull a comedy, despite its constant misery, or because of it.  Perhaps he was saying that we aren't supposed to suffer along with these characters; we are supposed to laugh our heads off at them.

The writing is so bad that there were several times in the movie that I actually said the line before the actor did.  It was so obvious, that the next line would be such and such, that I said it before the actor said it.  When that happens in a movie, you know you are dealing with incompetent writers.

One of the funniest things about this garbage is the acting of Eddie Fisher.  He disappears in the role.  He is simply not on screen.  His voice is so soft, and he has absolutely no stage presence.  He is the opposite of an actor.  His performance has the opposite of charisma.  Putting him next to an actor is like putting matter against anti-matter.  I'm surprised that he and Liz didn't explode and obliterate each other, because her stage presence is so strong and his is nonexistant.

They feed you the old garbage about a poor husband complaining that his wife is too rich and that his wife's family got him a job.  Oh poor thing.  He must escape his marriage and find some pride.  What planet is this on?  That old stupid cliche.  Hey, idiot, why don't you find some pride working in a car lot, or driving a cab, instead of accepting a responsible position taking advantage of an opportunity that your mother in law set up for you.  What idiocy.  The old bull, re-wrapped again.

Nothing about the writing of this trash is original.  It is just 1960 America showing off its cliches.  There are no real people in this movie.  It is utter garbage, and anyone who is impressed by it has no taste at all.  I totally agree with Liz.  Just goes to show that you can package any old trash and find some people to rave about it.

She did the movie to fulfill a contract obligation, so she could be freed up to do Cleopatra.  She always hated this trash.  The only thing I can say good about Butterfield 8 is that you can laugh at it.",1155340800,6,2698,4.274353876739562
397858,4,6301967690,"This is my favorite Elizabeth Taylor performance.

Writer Paul Monette refers to this film as being one in a 'trilogy' of bad girl roles for Elizabeth Taylor--the other two being ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""(1958) and ""Suddenly,Last Summer""(1959). These three films should be in every DVD collection. Certainly they present Taylor at her absolute physical peak, but they also show the dark side of her sexuality, which is quite riveting.

Taylor loves to refer to this movie as ""trash"", even though she won an Oscar for the role. Maybe she felt she was being exploited by the studio with this film's content  due to her highly publicized love affairs at the time. However, SEX SELLS, and as a beautiful, voluptuous, and semi-amoral model, Taylor has never been better. She simply smoulders in this film, especially in the 'morning after' scenes in the beginning. Taylor in her tight slip, drink in hand, is now an iconic Hollywood image. Also, she and Laurence Harvey make a VERY HOT team, SCORCHING, something we've never seen with Taylor and Richard Burton.

There's one scene in the film, in a nightclub, where Taylor and Harvey are at a table... and although Taylor is approached by a number of admirers, she continually looks over at Harvey, plays with her pearls, and smiles so shyly, SOOOO sweetly at him...a beautiful, glowing moment.

Contrast that with their final meeting in a diner: Harvey suprises Taylor there, and the frozen look of shock & awe on her face! Another wonderful moment...interestingly, this film is FILLED with many wonderful moments from Elizabeth the actor. She has many difficult scenes to play with no dialog--- she begins AND ends the film in long scenes with very little dialog--- yet she has created here a believable, complex 'sixties' heroine.

The movie is really a TAYLOR STAR VECHICLE, it's all about HER, with a great leading man, and some excellent supporting players. A great showcase.  And Elizabeth does do some good acting, very moving in the confession scene and in her last scene with Harvey as she tries to escape him. Her acting here is certainly Oscar-worthy to me.

Also interesting is the fact that this may be the first American film to link child molestation with promiscuity, or even talk about such subjects. Remember this was made in 1960.

For me this film is part of another trilogy... one of three Best Actress Oscar-winning roles of women gambling with their sexuality to find happiness, with each one losing--- Elizabeth here, Simone Signoret in ""Room at the Top"" (1959), and Julie Christie in ""Darling"" (1965)... and Laurence Harvey was in all THREE films!!",1138579200,8,2617,4.916099773242631
397859,3,6301967690,"""Butterfield 8"" pure and simple is overwrought soap opera.  You would not care about these people if not for the strong performances by the two central actors who imbue their characters with qualities that are not present on the written page.  Elizabeth Taylor as few actresses in history elevates otherwise mundane material into something other than.  It's debatable whether she deserved the Oscar she won for playing Gloria Wondrous but there's no debating that she earned it.  She had me won over in the film's opening scene where she awakens in another man's bed surveying the damage after another one night stand.  Taylor outwardly was probably the most beautiful woman in the world.  Her carriage in this scene suggests dissipation and internal decay and turmoil.  Laurence Harvey's Weston Liggett is Wondrous' soulmate in the sense that he is a self-loathing Park Avenue type who married well and vents his angst through booze and indiscriminate affairs.  It's inevitable when these two get together that sparks would fly but it's questionable whether you want to call it love.  Like Taylor, Harvey imbues Liggett with enough pathos that you feel empathy for an unlikable character.  I have mixed feelings about this film because it's not a pleasant viewing experience.

Waking up in Wes Liggett's Fifth Avenue penthouse, she discovers he's left her a wad of money and a note saying, ""Is $250 enough?"" She hurls the money away, scrawling ""No Sale"" on the mirror with her lipstick. But she seems to forget that she is a call girl, and call girls accept money for services rendered. Unfortunately, Gloria is in love with Liggett, her ""john"", but he is married to someone else - a society matron poorly played by the cold, patrician beauty, Dina Merrill. As Gloria is leaving, she steals Ligget's wife's $7000 fur coat and starts all kinds of trouble. It certainly would have caused trouble today - the entire film is a PETA nightmare, as Gloria can be clocked wearing suede, lynx, coyote, mink, sable, beaver, and something that looks like skunk. The whole movie has Liz in her last fading bloom of youth, girded-to-the-gills and at the peak of her ""eyebrows-of-death"" period. Her Gloria-ously voluptuous figure is beginning to bulge and sag, but she is decked out to the nines in drop-dead stylish early-60s glamour. At the time, Liz and Jackie Kennedy were neck-and-neck in the glamour department, and the Jackie look is unmistakably present in Liz's styling. Though Jackie's never would be, Liz's cleavage is on abundant display. Cleavage was such a powerful metaphor for sex, then - a set-piece whose effectiveness would be impossible now (you practically have to show actors rutting on the floor to satisfy the modern taste). Liz was also at the peak of her Eddie Fisher period - playing a harlot on screen after stealing Fisher away from his real-life wife, Debbie Reynolds, only added to Liz's plummeting reputation. Fisher plays Gloria's friend who loves her but is not taken seriously by her. He's such a drip onscreen, that you can't help wondering how in real life this guy managed to attract one of the most glamorous women in the world. The suave and very continental Harvey is equally dull, especially as he commandeers that last 20 minutes of the film.

The part of Gloria won an Oscar for Liz Taylor - mysteriously, since the work is far inferior to many of Liz's previous films. Liz has proclaimed that this is the least favorite film she ever made - she was simply fulfilling the requirements of her contract. But when Liz is good, she's very, very good, but when she's bad, she gives it all she's got. Director Daniel Mann definitely had a way with leading-ladies. In addition to guiding Liz towards her Oscar, he did the same for Shirley Booth in *Come Back, Little Sheba* and Anna Magnani in *The Rose Tattoo*. Also directing Susan Hayward in *I'll Cry Tomorrow*, Mann certainly excels in these heavy-handed soapers. Based on the racy John O'Hara novel, the dialogue is dreadful. At one point Gloria tells her shrink, ""I don't need you any more. I have no problems. I'm in love,"" as well as, ""Someday Wes is going to find himself, and I want to be there.""  The script was so bad my sister and I veered off into a conversation about the Austin yogurt shop murders, and missed a scene full of lots of drinking, ultimatums and arched eyebrows, but we were riveted to the screen as Gloria is screaming, ""Mama, face it! I was the slut of all time!"" But even when shrieking, Liz is irresistible.

The picture was supported by a fine dialogue. Once more Hiccock was right when he stated that the three most important fundamentals aspects for making a good film were ; first a good script , second a good script and third a good script .
Laurence Harvey is the lucky guy who commits adultery with that night butterfly , who later will fall in love with him . That perspective , however becomes in a complex device to explore the intimate world of all those people who live around them ; the fantasy world of Gloria, her glamorous desire to become a great lady , with an overshelter mother, a friend who makes the role of the brother she never had (Fisher is a mess as actor in this movie , maybe its only fault).
In the other side of the coin , Harvey is a married man who lives in a boring house with a unbearable wife , with nothing to say and nothing to give . So this marriage is just only a status convenience. He rebeals against this state of things but he is uncapable of break his marriage.
This situation is obviously hazardous for Gloria's growing expectations , who deeply in her mind still believes he'll divorce.
Powerful dramatis personae with an unexpected twist of fate.
Taylor in the peak of her cosmical beauty , but showing us also her powerful skill gifts acting.
Good transfer on DVD.

However, I was sorely disappointed in the acting by Laurence Harvey. I found his performance to be sorely lacking, his emotions forced and faked, and his overall acting style stiff and unbelievable. Sounds harsh, I know, but I wish the producer/director had found a better actor to fill this role, and then the film would have been much better.
On a final note, this is one of the best films I've ever seen about a prostitute. We can't mince words; that's exactly what Gloria is, although she tries to gloss it over. In addition, the final scene between Liggett and his wife is fairly decent,  leaving the viewers to surmise the outcome of their marriage with their own imaginations, even though his wife is EXTREMELY underdeveloped and has a too-good-to-be-true attitude about the entire situation.",1082073600,,971,4.884848484848485

She crawls out, dons a slip, brushes her teeth with bourbon and takes a tour of her pick-up's Park Avenue digs.  It doesn't quite match the combination of doom and sour comedy with which John O'Hara began the novel of the same title, but it gets close.  And as in the book, Taylor, as Gloria Wandrous, steals a mink coat and heads home.

And then everything goes wrong.  O'Hara's novel was a bit trashy at times, but it was in no way a soap opera.  The script, by Charles Schnee and John Michael Hayes, all but drowns in suds and overwrought dialogue.  Taylor, although really too old to be playing Gloria, got at the character's wit and self-destructive streak and even made some of the god-awful talk compelling.  As Weston Liggett, the human sewage who helps to send Gloria to her doom, Laurence Harvey is very good as long as he's being rotten and predatory; he tries manfully to convince us that Liggett has some sort of humanity benath his tailored scales, but fails.  And Dina Merrill isn't even given a chance to play his pathetic wife, who in the book is tied by emotional needs and sexual attraction to a man she knows is destroying her bit by bit.  She changes shirtwaists every few scenes and smiles through her tears.  Eddie Fisher does what he can with the role of Gloria's platonic friend, who narrates the book in flashback, and he's actually not all that bad, just sort of irrelevant in this version of things.  One could also talk about the film's absurd ending and the attempt to elevate the ghastly Wandrous-Liggett liaison to a tale of doomed and forbidden love, but it's sheer waste of breath, as would be any words about Daniel Mann's mostly non-existant direction--he made sure the actors hit their marks and let the crew do the rest.

The crew knew what they were doing; Joseph Ruttenburg did nice location photography in New York and lit the interiors to within an inch of their life.  Helen Rose made Taylor look gorgeous and Dina Merrill appropriately WASPy.  Bronislau Kaper's music is one of the few things in the film that seem influenced by O'Hara's novel itself; musky with sex and despair and icy with a sense of impending doom--too bad none of that made it into the script . . .",1078531200,2,2338,4.559808612440191

397908,5,6301967690,"`The most desirable girl in town is the easiest to find. Just call Butterfield-8!' So trumpeted the posters of this, Elizabeth Taylor's first Oscar winning performance. The film is a modernization of the 1935 novel by John O'Hara, which was based on the real life of the 1920's New York City call girl Starr Faithful.

Miss Taylor was dead set against playing Gloria Wandrous. She felt was a deliberate play by M.G.M. to capitalize on her recent notoriety in the Liz-Eddie-Debbie scandal. Also, she was anxious to move on to her first ever million-dollar role in Fox's Cleopatra. She was told by M.G.M that if she did not fulfill her contractual obligation to her home studio for one final film on her eighteen year contract that she would be kept off the screen for two years and miss making Cleopatra all together. She swore to the producer Pandro S. Berman that she would not learn her lines, not be prepared and in fact not give anything more and a walk through. Mr. Berman knew her better than she suspected. In the end Elizabeth Taylor turned in a professional, classic old style Hollywood performance that ranks at the top with the best of her work. She brings a savage rage to live to her searing portrait of a lost girl soaked through with sex and gin. A woman hoping against all hope to find salvation in yet one last man. Weston Leggett, a man who is worse off than she is in the self-esteem department. In her frantic quest for a clean new life Gloria finds that the male establishment will not allow her to step out of her role as a high priced party girl. She is pigeon holed by her past and the narrow mores of the late 50's are not about to let her fly free. Not the bar-buzzards of Wall Street, not her best friend Steve who abandons her at his girlfriend's insistence. Not even her shrink Dr. Treadman believes in her. The three women in her life are blind to who she really is. Her mother will not admit what Gloria has become. Mrs. Thurber will not believe she can ever change and Happy, the motel proprietor is too self involved in her own past to care who Gloria is She is the dark Holly Golightly and this is the lurid red jelled Metro-Color Manhattan that is the flip side of Billy Wilder's The Apartment (also 1960). Wilder's New York is cynical. Liz's tony East Side phone exchange rings only one way, the hard way. This New York is dammed. The film concludes in a melodramatic blaze that Douglas Sirk might have envied in place of his usually unsettling, unconvincing happy endings. In the end we have a bravura performance by the last true star of the old system. Yes she deserved the Oscar more for `Cat'. Yes it was given to welcome her back from the brink of death in London. And even Shirley MacLaine's lament on Oscar night, `I lost the Oscar to a tracheotomy.' can not diminish this must see performance by Miss Taylor.

397910,4,6301967690,"I bought this film because I so liked Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?  I wanted to see what Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for and she does deliver as kind of a Holly Golightly gone darkly tragic.  The great part of her character is that she's somewhere between a prostitute and a mistress and she doesn't let anyone else define the line for her.  That was nice.  It would've been easy to make her the prostitute with the heart of gold but it was more interestign to have Eddie Fisher as her best friend/unrequited lover and a Debbie Reynolds lookalike as his fiancee who is disgusted with his relationship with her.
There was some criticism of Fisher's part in the film, him not being the super actor that everyone else in the film is, I disagreed.  The dark irony of them playing out their real life affair in the film, packing movei houses I'm sure and also his lack of sophistication, his lack of dazzle to interest her as anything but a safe space was really a nice twist on their real life relationship.
I hail Virginia Wolf as one of the best films of all time but this one has a nice dark humor to it and Taylor is strog as a woman who is literally chased by her life to the ends of her life.
Prostitutes and dying at the end, along with disabilities was a shoe in for winning Oscars for awhile, even though Taylor comes off as immoral.  And by the time she decides to reveal herself as a caring person circumstance destroys her shakey reputation and eventually even her psyche.
Her lover, who decides to leave his diletante lifestyle comes off as insanely intense and Taylor does a nice turn as going from shark to being sympathetic as she's pushed to the edge of love and identity.",1047254400,,1689,4.397435897435898

Some of the dialogue is very enjoyable and smart (though some of it is stilted), and the movie was unusually frank for a film that was released in 1960.  (It also gives you a feel for Manhattan at that time.)  There is also some psychological depth in the way it depicts the difficulty someone may have in breaking away from their ""past.""And Elizabeth Taylor has never looked more sensual and alluring, and she brings genuine feeling to the character she plays.  She's very convincing.",1037750400,7,646,4.783783783783784
397912,5,6301967690,"No, Liz did not deserve the Oscar for this in 1960. But she deserves credit for delivering a campy performance of rare distinction. Based on a trashy novel of the same name, this is a cleaned up screen version that's still trashy enough to wallow in as a guilty pleasure. It's not even a good movie. But Liz makes it watchable anyway. She plays Gloria Wondrous (that NAME!) a ""model"" (i.e call girl) who lives a depraved life of booze, money and men until she falls for a ""trick"" (Laurence Harvey) who's married. She tries to make it work but he won't give her the respectability she craves so she drives her hot little red sports car off a cliff. Mildred Dunnock is her denial-ridden mother and Betty Field wraps it up as a wise-cracking neighbor who knows what Gloria is and won't give it a rest. ""How's church?"" she deadpans at Gloria. Gloria's response? ""Why don't you go sometime and find out!"" I can't recommend this for serious movie lovers but for lovers of glossy trashy camp this is a must.",1034380800,9,1000,4.5
397913,3,6301967690,"Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar-winning turn as a prostitute highlights an otherwise average film about an emotionally troubled prostitute who tries to go straight when she falls in love with a kindred spirit, a boozy lawyer stuck in a miserable marriage. (""Pretty Woman"" it ain't). What could have been a crackling adaption of  John O'Hara's tragic novel is instead a trashy, dramatically uneven, clich-riddled film with a tacked-on (and ludicrous) happy ending that completely undermines the source material. Granted, Hollywood's censors would not have allowed a really faithful adaption of O'Hara's sexually charged novel, but even with the necessary trimming it should have been better. Taylor's bittersweet performance as Gloria Wandrous is by far the best thing about the film, though most of the cast acquits themselves well, particularly Lawrence Harvey as her lover, Weston Leggett. Eddie Fisher, cast only because he was Liz`s then-husband, sleepwalks through the film. Even with its flaws, it's worth seeing once, though, because Liz is simply commanding, dominating every scene she's in. Her performance edges alarmingly close to campy overacting at times, but she always knows when to reign it in, and she gives Gloria far more depth than the dreadful script could have hoped for. For those who only know Liz from her frequent tabloid headlines, here is a chance to get to know the versatile and dynamic actress who once took Hollywood by storm (though I recommend starting with ""National Velvet""). Ironically, Liz says she hates this film, possibly due to being forced (blackmailed is more like it) into it by her contract at MGM.",1030147200,2,1637,5.272030651340996

I thought... awww she is being to hard on it, but no. It was a very forgettable film. Watch it once to satisfy your curiousity, it is not a rewatchable film. Shame.",1026345600,,510,4.161616161616162
397915,3,6301967690,"Based upon the John O'Hara novel of the same name, this film won Elizabeth Taylor an Oscar in 1960 for Best Actress. Not bad, considering that this, her last film for MGM,  was a film in which she had not wanted to act.
Ms. Taylor plays a beautiful young woman, Gloria Wandrous, with serious self-esteem problems that lead her to live of life of cheap thrills. By day a dress model, by night a bon vivant, Gloria is a professional escort gotten by dialing Butterfield 8, loving and leaving so many men that she is regarded as being nothing more than a tramp. She is outwardly a bad girl with a good girl buried inside. Her childood friend, Steve (Eddie Fisher), is supportive of her and believes that she has more to offer the world than pure, unadulterated sex, while her mother (Mildred Dunnock) is in serious denial about her daughter's escapades.
When Gloria meets Weston Liggett (Laurence Harvey), an unhappily married attorney who has his own issues, she undergoes a change of heart as she falls in love with him. He, too, falls in love with her. Alas, the path of true love never seems to run smoothly. Their romance is no exception.
Laurence Harvey does a good job as Liggett, a man who struggle with his pride for having married his wealthy wife, Emily (Dina Merrill), whose family has him on a golden leash . Dina Merrill is good as Emily, but her role is terribly dated. She plays it as if she were a Stepford wife, a good little wife who will patiently wait until her husband stops boozing it up and whoring around. Her scene with her mother on this very issue, in which her mother congratulates her on her wisdom, is enough to make the viewer laugh.
Eddie Fisher, who was cast as Steve by means of being married to Liz Taylor, displays zero talent as an actor. In fact, so uncharismatic is he on screen that he leaves the viewer wondering what it was that Elizabeth Taylor ever saw in him in real life. Susan Oliver, who credibly plays the role of Steve's girfriend, is made up to resemble Debbie Reynolds in order to capitalize on the Hollywood scandal that saw Eddie Fisher leave his wife and children for Elizabeth Taylor. In fact, I took a double take when I first saw Ms. Oliver come on screen, so obvious was it that she was made to look like Ms. Reynolds. Talk about bottom feeding!
This is a film that is a curiosity piece at best, filled with what passed at the time as sophisticated repartee. While Ms. Taylor does a decent job with the role of Gloria, the film is so dated as to be almost laughable. Still, fans of Ms. Taylor will enjoy seeing her at her most beautiful.",1026259200,12,2594,4.449579831932773
397916,4,6301967690,"""Butterfield 8,"" directed by Daniel Mann, is basically a trashy soap opera. Elizabeth Taylor plays Gloria, a booze-guzzling, ... promiscuous young woman who becomes involved with an unhappily married businessman (Laurence Harvey). The opening scenes well establish the film's vibe: the story is saturated with cigarettes, alcohol, money, expensive fur, sex, and fury.
That said, I found B8 to be a wonderfully entertaining and surprisingly moving film. The delicious dialogue is full of memorable lines (like the one I used for the title of this review). The characters zap each other with some biting insults. A typical exchange between two characters: ""Oh mother, don't be vulgar."" Response: ""Vulgarity has its uses.""
The entire cast is solid, but this is undeniably Taylor's film. She takes what could have been a campy caricature and instead gives Gloria real depth and humanity. By the end of the film I was really engrossed in Gloria's personal journey. B8 may not be a great Hollywood classic, but it's a great showcase for the legendary Taylor.",1025913600,33,1052,5.194117647058824

Mildred Dunnock, Betty Field, Kay Medford - these three were always terrific in everything. The biggest failure is Eddie Fisher, who did it at Liz' insistence. He was a good singer and he should have stuck with that. I always felt that he was a victim of the Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds soap that we know so much more about, now that Debbie finally got round  accepting some of the responsibility.

7818785,2,6301967690,"Review of BUtterfield 8
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

The reason BUtterfield 8 is so famous is two-fold: Elizabeth Taylor and the Hays Code. Before the fall of the Hays Code, a movie like this could never be made, so in 1960, Hollywood was thrilled to make a film about a call-girl. Since the call-girl was played by someone so beautiful and scantily clad, audiences were thrilled to see it. When they flocked to the theaters upon its release, they were greeted by life size cardboard cutouts of Elizabeth Taylor (I know movie theaters today are always decorated like that, but in 1960 it was new) and phone booths in which you could dial the phone number BUtterfield 8 and listen to a prerecorded message from the star. What a publicity campaign!

Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar during the 1961 ceremony, but it was clear even at the time that she didn't really win for her performance. Shed recovered from a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia near the voting period, and since shed recently made her way back into Americas good graces after being branded as a homewrecker, the Academy rewarded her.

Liz herself notoriously dissed the film, and I cant say I blame her. The film isn't that great, and its also pretty dated, since countless movies about prostitutes have been made since. The shock value isn't there anymore. If you want to see Elizabeth Taylor in a negligee and you cant find Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, I guess you can sit through this one. But try and find something else; there are so many other movies that show off her beauty.",1500422400,,1539,4.568840579710145
