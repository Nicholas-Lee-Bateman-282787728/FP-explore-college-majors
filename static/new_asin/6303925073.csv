733825,5,6303925073,"These were the words announcer Jim Brown would repeat every now and then. While old Jim knew little to nothing about fighting,(one questions why he was even an anouncer?) he was actually right. An incredible tournament,  invloving a Tank, a Polar Bear, and even a Russian Bear. Brutal at times,  but with absolutle beautiful technical fighting from Oleg Taktarov. We see  the first of infamous David ""Tank"" Abbott and his in-your-face  fighting and out of the ring attitude. The tournament final was a classic  battle that went for 17 minutes in the high altitude of Casper, Wyoming. As  far as the superfight, a champ was still needed. Due to UFC V's draw, Ken  Shamrock and Dan Severn battled for the gold. There was no draw this time  around as the ""beast"" was tamed. A great show, with past veterans  returning, (Pat Smith, Harold Howard, and Dave Beneteau) coupled with  very  explosive debuts. Also the last we see of Jim Brown, a veteran  ""announcer"" since UFC I.",963532800,,970,4.77710843373494

733828,5,6303925073,"Wow! This is by far the best UFC ever made. You have a great tounament with people like Tank Abbott, Oleg Taktarov, Pat Smith, and Paul Varleans. Plus, the Greatest Superfight of all time, With Ken Shamrock VS. Dan  Severn. The Tournament itself has 3 knock outs, 1 quick submission, One  Kick to the Chest that levels somene, a great superfight, and an even  better tournament finale. You gotta buy this tape if your only gonna buy  one.",954633600,,438,4.576923076923077
733829,5,6303925073,"This is the best UFC without a doubt! The birth of the Tank is something that should be witnessed by all, UFC fan or not. Watching John Matua go into convulsions is shocking. Watch Pat Smith lift Rudyard Moncayo off his  feet with one brutal kick. All this topped off with one amazing superfight.  All a UFC fan can ask for.",945043200,,324,4.295081967213115
733830,4,6303925073,"I agree this is one of the best UFC`s to date with tank abborts brutal first round victory but how can you have a UFC with out Royce Gracie. The only person who came near to taming him was Ken Shamrock who is superfight  champion at this point in time but no one can be called the  ""real"" UFC champion until they have beaten Royce Gracie in a no  rules match (no time limits, no draws).  other than that brillant to  watch.",934502400,,423,4.109756097560975
733831,5,6303925073,"You won't find a better UFC event.  Watch David ""Tank"" Abbott in his first fight; it is definitely a memorable one.  An all-out street fight in the second quarterfinal match.  Oleg Taktarov comes back to the UFC.  In  my opinion, the greatest match ever happened in UFC VI, and it was the  final.  This is an incredible UFC which no one should pass up.",914716800,,352,4.40625
7856029,5,6303925073,Of of my personal favorite's. Every fight is action packed and the Taktarov/Abbott fight was a great ending. A must see!!,1160438400,,121,4.809523809523809
7856030,5,6303925073,"Possibly the best UFC show of all time. With Gracie and Shamrock in the first ever superfight this is a time when the main draw is dominated by character over technique and with a mixture of bulk, power, toughness and overall determination UFC 6 will have you out of your seat from the very start. What perhaps lets the show down for the general viewer is surprisingly the super fight. However for those more experienced viewers this definitely still presents an interesting look at how two opponents change their style the second time they meet. An absolute must buy.",1122163200,,568,4.747474747474747
7856031,5,6303925073,"this is easily the best ufc,just wished they went back to this format instead of turning it like boxing,with rounds and judges.debut of tank is superb,in yer face haymaker throwin punches.pat smith is back with one of the best standing kicks i've ever seen.shamrock vs severn is a great superfight,and lastly oleg taktarov,who is a master of sambo shows what he can do,even after get battered for 17 mins,worth buying,even if u don't like fighting",1059523200,,447,4.973333333333334
7856032,5,6303925073,"UFC 6 was (for one of the first times) dominated by strikers (fighters who rely on punching, kicking etc) but of course, there were some grapplers as well and of course, a highly anticipated SUPERFIGHT match between KEN SHAMROCK and DAN ""THE BEAST"" SEVERN.
There were 2 stand out things from this particular UFC, the debut of DAVID ""TANK"" ABBOTT and the return of OLEG ""THE RUSSIAN BEAR"" TAKTAROV. Abbott's fights were amazing and for once, a boxer/street fighter did the UFC proud (unlike unfortunately Melvin Bowen in UFC 4). The matches are fast, furious and in one case, almost deadly.
Some of the other fighters on the card of UFC 6 were returing UFC 2 finalist Thai Kickboxer PAT SMITH, Karate champion RUDY MONCAYO, Tae Kwon Do expert CAL WORSHAM, ERNIE VERDICIA (I think that's his name), 400 lb Hawaiian Grappler JOHN MATUA  and 330 lbs of PAUL ""THE POLAR BEAR"" VARELANS.
Check out UFC 6! For any of you who get bored with grappling matches and don't like the technicality those kind of matches, this one is all bare knuckle, head pounding, butt kicking striking action. Also, don't forget to check out UFC ULTIMATE ULTIMATE showcasing the best of the best of the UFC Combatants (up until early 1997).",1044403200,,1210,4.734597156398104

7856034,4,6303925073,Lots of great fights here.  Pat smith returns from ufc 2 to demonstrate his kicking stregnth and a dynamic final takes place between a fighter who's raw stregnth overwhelms the previous competition and a master grappler who holds the fastest win in ufc history.  You won't see a lot of fights like the last one and the first round is very entertaining when pat smith delivers one of the most devastating opening attacks in no holds barred history and tank abbot demonstrates the raw force he can put out in a matter of seconds.  Definitely a worthy watch.,1028505600,,555,4.642857142857143

Piling on the power,passion and 'brawlability'.I must have watched this tape more times than all the other UFC's I own put together.
You want brutal full on fighting?..Check out Tank's fights. You want powerful yet intricate MMA action?...check out Takarov.
You want blood,guts and thunder look no further than the Worsham vs Varlans fight.
You wanna know the benefit of cross training?...Shamrock vs Servern is just the ticket.
You want a just and worthy winner to cheer for?..Yep it's got that too.
Brutal and enthrawling this UFC is worth fighting for.",1005609600,,601,4.96039603960396

While 31 is full of amazing technical fighting, this is from the good old days when the only rule was smash or be smashed..... TANK ABBOT fans will love his demolition of John Matua ... in fact Tank's involvement makes this one of the bloodier tournys around.
But who wins the tournament... Sledge Hammer fists and wrestling ability...or a combination Sambo & Jui Jitsu???????
you won't regret buying this...unless you think fighting is barbaric...woos.",1003104000,,568,4.978947368421053
7856037,5,6303925073,"My favorite UFC so far. There were so many great matchups here.
Shamrock versus Severn is a classic battle. Pat Smith again shows
what an all round great fighter he is. Perhaps my favorite matchup ever is Tank Abbot verusus Taktarov. Just a preview...
Both the winner and the loser had to be given oxygen after the fight. Like the Gracie Kimo fight in UFC 3 the two contestants
showed what it means to be a warrior. This fight is the ultimate
in terms of competitive sports. A must see.
My general complaint against this and all UFC videos is why can't
they get real announcers and a real camera crew. Is it still so
low budget? I don't mind Jim Brown but he doesn't know much about
martial arts. Hire ESPN or something!",1001721600,,720,4.380597014925373
7856038,3,6303925073,"UFC VI brings together such heavy-weights as Tank Abbott (rookie), Oleg Taktarov, Dave Benneteau, Paul Varelans (rookie), and Cal Worsham (rookie). While many of the fights are won by sheer body mass and/or brute force, but watch for the ones in between, where technique triumphs in the end. A few fights seem to drag on forever, but you have to take the good along with the bad, some of these fighters are just too evenly matched. The high altitude (Casper, Wyoming) gets the best of some fighters at times, but it makes things interesting, as they're forced to rely on stamina.
The superfight between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn brings a lot of excitement to this video. These two UFC veterans seem to be pretty evenly matched at first, but we soon see that appearances can be deceiving. The final match is exciting, and it brings a grappler and striker together -- the results are surprising.
Other highlights include Pat Smith, who levels his opponent with a kick right at the beginning of the bout and liquidates him in a few seconds. Tank Abbott hurts John Matua rather severely, and it's touch-and-go for a few seconds there (watch for the trembling legs when he goes unconscious). Fortunately, referee McCarthy jumps in and ends the fight before Tank can do any more damage.
Only 3 stars because I like to see fighters with skill and technique enter the octagon, rather than brutes who ""improvise"". After all, it's pitting different fighting styles that makes UFC so exciting. If you take that away, you diminish the excitement. While UFC VI has its moments, many of its participants lack the style and elegance of their predecessors.",973555200,,1642,4.826241134751773
