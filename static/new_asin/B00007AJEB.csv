7974804,4,B00007AJEB,"A powerful treatment of one of the several notorious serial killers in Germany in the 1920s.  Fritz Lang's memorable ""M"" of 1931 was based on a composite of them.  George is remarkable.",1377734400,,185,4.75
7974805,5,B00007AJEB,"Goetz George is the greatest German actor ever! This is an amazing movie. The whole movie is a dialog, but it doesn't get boring at all. I would highly recommend this incredible piece of art!",1229040000,,191,4.485714285714286
7974806,4,B00007AJEB,"Gotz George's portrayal as serial slicer Fritz Haarmann just might give you nightmares. Horror fans like to complain about all the re-treads coming out of Hollywood, as well as anything with any originality... Well, here's one that's not a re-tread and is pretty damn original--and all of it done without any gore and/or ""visible"" mayhem.

The only ""drawback,"" as someone else mentioned, is the fact the entire tale unfolds inside the interrogation room of a bug bin. Yep.

Would have gladly given it five stars--if only, IF ONLY the filmmaker of this otherwise well-made film, had taken his story out of the room for a bit, and I mean anywhere: down to the serial killer's cell, etc., anywhere would have been fine and allowed for a bit of respite--and then returned to the aforementioned room for more grilling.

Alas, that does not happen...  (I do understand: the intent was to stay faithful to the actual transcripts and keep the tale within the confines of this one room.)

All in all,  quite an accomplishment. As indicated, based on actual interviews with said slice-and-dice gent.

Not kidding about the nightmares, either. View at your own risk.",1182297600,3,1155,4.922680412371134
7974807,4,B00007AJEB,"After seeing Gtz George years ago in a German detective series, the role he plays in this movie shows his talent from a totally different side.

Although I was quite impressed by his portraying of a deranged serial killer, the movie left me yearning for more. I was constantly waiting for the camera to veer off to show some of the gruesome things that Fritz Haarmann had done. Instead, the whole movie plays inside the interview room of the hospital and to be honest, I grew tired of the same setting. Nevertheless, the bottomline is that the two main characters in this movie are portrayed beautifully by the actors.

The DVD also has two short films on it which I found an absolute waste of thirty-odd minutes. They are strange, to say the least.",1168560000,2,749,4.582089552238806
7974808,5,B00007AJEB,"The Deathmaker (Der Totmacher) is one of those Films where you can't keep your eyes off the actors. Goetz George's acting is amazing. Especially if you understand German (I am German), this will amaze you.
There is an aspect to this film I can only describe with ""stunning"". Not many movies capture interrogations this way. It shows you what great an actor George is, and it's a pity that he hasn't made that many fine movies since then, but I'd still count them to the best german actors living today.
The Deathmaker is a film you should definitely see. The DVD allows you to switch on the english subtitles, so if you don't understand German you'll at least understand it, but I am sure some of the acting gets lost of course. A good dubbing would've been nice, but still.
Highest recommendation",1059004800,18,797,4.619718309859155
