4330891,4,B004CZRE3K,"Better story line to this than ""Home is where the Hart is"" and Lionel Stander still making an appearanace as the ever faithful Max. Think the Hart's must be on lean times though as no more private jet and having to fly ""Delta"" airways!!!!Heaven forbid! Enjoyable Sunday afternoon viewing though,series 1&2 offer more value for money and as others have said hope Sony release 3-5 in due course :o)",1321228800,2,396,4.753623188405797

4330913,4,B004CZRE3K,I liked the movie because of the 2 individuals who were the main characters but the plot was not as good as some of the other movies in the series.

8424161,1,B004CZRE3K,I really would like to give all these movies a minus because there appears to be a problem watching them - there is absolutely nothing on them.  They arrive here in good condition and then I put them into my Sony dvd player and absolutely nothing!  I believe they are made in China and that might be the problem.  Maybe there is a difference in the electronics.  There is nothing wrong with my dvd player because all my other movies are normal. KG,1438473600,,447,4.349397590361446

8424164,5,B004CZRE3K,"If you loved the TV series or these actors - these movies are a must for your mystery movie collection!  After the series got unexpectedly cancelled, as it was still on top - they produced special movie mysteries - lots of guest stars, campiness, humor, and beautiful locations - they don't make light fun tv anymore - these movies stand with the times with class, romance, light intrigue, fun and mystery.",1427760000,,406,4.71830985915493
