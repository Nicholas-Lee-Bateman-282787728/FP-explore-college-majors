8401527,3,B003O9ZB7Q,"It's a strange choice -- producing a musical with people who are not very good singers. The plot is not deep or well developed. Somehow, I still enjoyed watching this movie. I have no idea why. So I gave it a three out of five.",1488585600,,227,4.066666666666666

8401530,5,B003O9ZB7Q,"If ever there was a film a top 10 list of films to write about, it's this joyful celebration of guerilla movie making and queer cinema. The review does not include all of its awards, but I was lucky enough for this to be my first film to watch at a GLBT film fest. From the opening credits, even with sound that the engineer kept messing with, I was hooked. And so were many others since it won the Best Overall Film for Fort Worth's Q Cinema Fest in 2009.

Bethesda is a heroine in the best way imaginable. Through her series of events in San Fransisco's queer culture, underground art scene, and the home she shares with 5 other unique characters, Bethesda finds a solace not always finding the answers one seeks. A moral that applies to every walk of life. It is indeed too bad more high school girls won't find out about this film because there is so much positive reflection on finding one's identity while searching for something else. Maybe in time, it will find its way to a larger audience. It is indeed more universal in scope than one would think from the title and the genre it is marketed within.

The supporting characters all play their roles around Bethesda with gusto, with special recognition going to Mike Curtis and H.P. Mendoza's own performances of a hopeful hookup in ""Versatile Bottoms,"" and ""monologues"" by the two older characters in the film. Don't be distracted by the ""queerness"" or ""pop musical"" label for this film. It's an enjoyable uplifting film that deserves to be ranked among the genres best offerings and hopefully have future sing along events of its own.",1415059200,,1594,4.609154929577465
8401531,5,B003O9ZB7Q,"Fruit Fly is very often delightful, especially any scene featuring Mike Curtis (Windy) or H P Mendoza (Mark); both are very talented, sexy men with a whole lot of charisma.

Best of all is a scene in the very middle of the movie in which Windy and Mark meet on an awkward blind date and sing ""We Have So Much in Common"", by far the best singers singing the best of the movie's many fantastic original songs.

It's a joyously raunchy and brilliant celebration of gay-bar cruising that could easily have been titled ""Versatile Bottoms"". The movie's star, L A Renigen (Bethesda), is very much less interesting; unfortunately, this is mainly her (boring) story, and she's in nearly every scene.

Aside from Curtis and Mendoza, the other characters are annoying and the actors only marginally competent. A few characters (Gaz, Jacob, Tracy and Dirty Judy) are so obnoxious that I wish they'd been left out entirely; they're expendable, and they could easily have ruined the movie.

But Mendoza's almost two dozen brilliant songs and his and Curtis's on-screen charisma - individually and together - overcome the movie's weaknesses and make it a joy to watch. They're SO GOOD that they raise an otherwise two-star movie to a full five stars.",1403481600,2,1235,4.866666666666666
8401532,4,B003O9ZB7Q,but this film exceeded my expectations. It is very quirky but very watchable.  The music is witty and upbeat. And it leaves you feeling good.,1353369600,,141,4.64
8401533,5,B003O9ZB7Q,"Very enjoyable., I highly recommend it.  The actors are not American Idol singers but that adds to the charm of the movie.  A great movie to just kick back and enjoy.",1346889600,2,166,4.32258064516129
