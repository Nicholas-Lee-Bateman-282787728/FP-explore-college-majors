8474446,2,B005IAIWU2,"Okay....the filmmaker builds a relationship with some bum guy from England who lives in a tent, (hello, anybody home?) then gets married a second time...they have a kid and divorce. Over what?!.....not sure. I don't care. He leaves and poor is kid has no dad. Because she gave him the big black boot out the door",1397520000,,312,4.589285714285714
8474447,5,B005IAIWU2,"If you can't relate to some part of this movie, you haven't every been in a REAL relationship.  It was scary how some of these stories sounded familiar.",1387756800,,152,4.428571428571429
8474448,3,B005IAIWU2,"Gottman, as always, was compelling. Barash not. Coontz interesting. The premise of putting your own troubled marriage under the microscope, by making a documentary, seemed masochistic.",1380931200,,184,6.115384615384615
8474449,1,B005IAIWU2,"I was looking forward to showing clips to my class about relationships. Unfortunately, this clip has unnecessary nudity and I was not able to use it.  Total #fail in my opinion.",1378771200,,177,4.709677419354839
8474450,5,B005IAIWU2,"already recommended it to my friends.  hilarious at times, thought provoking at others.  watched it with my boyfriend.  he really liked it too.  her next movie looks like it will be good too ""Do I need this?"".",1357603200,,209,4.5675675675675675
8474451,5,B005IAIWU2,"After Happily Ever After is such a clever little film, uplifting despite the conclusions it reaches about marriage and the conclusion of filmmaker Kate Schermerhorn's own marriage, the crumbling of which she documents as she endeavors to find, by interviewing long-married couples, the secret(s) to creating and maintaining a successful marriage.  Kate's talking heads have interesting, and even enlightening, things to say and are attractively made-up.  Kate's honesty about her own troubled new marriage (to her partner in the making of this film) adds interest and lightness to the movie.  After Happily Ever After succeeds at what all good documentaries try to do: entertain you while making you think, really think, about a subject that you heretofore might have taken for granted, like the role of marriage in modern society - what is that role?  Does it even make sense to get married anymore? Is monogamy possible or even desirable?  Kate Schermerhorn is an engaging filmmaker and I am looking forward to her next film.",1326153600,,1027,5.2
8474452,5,B005IAIWU2,"I love to both laugh and cry when watching a movie or reading a book and After Happily Ever After had me doing both along with truly thinking about the complexities of marriage.  Having been married 22+ years, it was a great wake up call to have this humorous yet serious documentary give me many lenses from which to look at my relationship.  I love the combination of watching one person's journey, along with listening to the professional experts and the variety of couples interviewed - awesome to have all than in one story.  I have to add that Kate Schermerhorn is a talented director and the visuals of the movie are worth it as a stand alone reason to watch.  I would highly recommend this to anyone considering marriage or in a relationship.",1322784000,,750,4.574626865671642
8474453,5,B005IAIWU2,"As someone who spent more than a year reading every research paper ever written on the subject of marriage, I was delighted to find this wonderful, quirky, clever film. After Happily Ever After follows one woman's quest to find out the secret to wedded bliss. The interviews are in turns hilarious and profound (my husband in particular enjoyed the nudist couple) and highlight the truth that there really is someone out there for everyone. (The dress-alike-EVERY-SINGLE-DAY couple? Come on! Who'd have thought?) Whether you're single, married or divorced--and happy or unhappy about your current status--this movie is packed with hope, humor and insight surrounding the subject of eternal love.",1321833600,,695,5.385321100917431
