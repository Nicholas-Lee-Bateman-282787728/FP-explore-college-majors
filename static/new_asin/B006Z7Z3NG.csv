5038466,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"I like these kind of movies and I like Michael Rooker, but this one fails miserably.  With little or no explanation to the hokey 'monster', you spend the entire time not understanding how it exists, how Rooker came to the lake his whole life and never saw it, why it waited until it was stuck under the ice before hunting humans, why it wounds first or sometimes kills, why why why....Sure, some creative license is understood in a low budget horror flick, but this one just goes to far - wait until the ending if you are not convinced I am correct.  You reach a point of not caring about the characters or whether this creature lives on to kill another day. Dare I mention that the creature is a modern ripoff of the Creature from the Black Lagoon...",1349654400,4,751,4.39568345323741
5038467,5,B006Z7Z3NG,"I've been watching films since the 1950's, so my opinion should count for something.
James Felix McKenney (Director) has come a long way. In this film you can see he has learned one of the most important lessons in film-making: Really good actors can make any premise believeable. Blanche Baker as the Mother must be mentioned for her wonderfully enacted role. She was sooo good! And,of course, Michael Rooker was superb.
I just felt that I should write a good & kind review for ""Hypothermia"" because, in my mind, I will always think of it as one of my favorite low budget-modern day-old timey Monster Movies!
PS- I always, always buy DVD's when I see that Larry Fessenden has had a hand in their production or writing or acting. (Glass Eye Pix) To me his name is a sign of quality and good fun to be had! And be sure NOT to forget Larry's Audio CD's of Creepy,Old-Timey Radio Tales. They are also a lot of fun! (And,No- I don't know Larry....just his work!)",1349568000,4,958,4.511494252873563
5038468,3,B006Z7Z3NG,"I don't mean the ""good old days"",  in the sense of films with somebody in a rubber monster suit, which is what this is like, but I mean, the good old days when Dark Sky Films actually put out reissues of obscure & forgotten films that were fantastic.  The good old days before they took the low road like Anchor Bay and started releasing mediocre stuff that was Syfy quality or worse.

Hypothermia is yet another mediocre offering in a long long list of mediocre offerings.  Family goes ice fishing, meet up with obnoxious self-made man & son who arrive to do the same but have way more ""stuff"", most all meet with early demises due to presence of rubber suit monster who was never any problem before this year.  Hmm.  Wonder why?  Anyway, I can't say this is the worst film I've ever seen, because there are plenty of things worse than this, but don't consider that an endorsement of the quality of this film.  At 73 minutes it's a tolerable time-waster but nothing more.  And the ending?  Hmm, yeah, a great idea for when one has run out of ideas, I guess, but it didn't do it for me.

5038469,5,B006Z7Z3NG,"Being a big time horror fan and a diehard collector I love this movie alot, the acting and special effects were right on point.
You encounter a lake monster in the dead winter was a brilliant idea and concept, the monster effects was hands down freaking awesome and unique. Hypothermia is a downright horror/science fiction monster you must have in your collection of monster films. Having this film in my horror collection is truly a honor, hats off to MPI Media Group, Glass Eye Pix and Dark Sky Films for bringing and distributing this film to horror fans like myself who live and breathe horror films. Hypothermia gets 2 thumps, a perfection 10 and 5 stars...HYPOTHERMIA KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE GENRE OF MONSTER/HORROR FILMS:)",1349481600,5,730,4.848
5038470,4,B006Z7Z3NG,"Visually masterful underground cinema. The bleak, but beautiful setting of the frozen lake is warped by a minimalistic luciferian score. The pacing is hypnotic, at times slow, but meditative.

I enjoyed the plot, which was a tongue-in-cheek combination of fishing, family drama, and horror. It was a weird mix of exactly what you'd expect and complete ridiculousness. It could use some more tits and more gore, but maybe that will happen in part 2.

The acting is b-movie camp outside of Michael Rooker and Amy Chang. You've got to listen closely to grab some of the bizarre stuff the characters say with straight faces.

It seems that swimming below the traditional genre flourishes there is a subversive social message. I definitely didn't watch it for the relevant message, but instead enjoyed it for the eerie tension and creepiness.

This is my favorite McKenney film with Automatons trailing close behind it.",1349308800,4,914,5.073333333333333
5038471,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"""We're gonna need a bigger hole.""  Ray (Rooker) and his family are together again for another ice fishing trip. While they are out on the ice enjoying themselves another father and son show up and quickly start to annoy Ray and family. When they notice something ""as big as a sturgeon"" they come up with a plan to catch it. When it starts to attack them the plan changes and saving lives are the priority. I  am a fan of the cheesy sci/fy channel movies, the over the top acting and bad effects make them fun to watch, going in I was expecting that level of film making from this one. I have to say this was in most cases better then that level. The acting wasn't good but wasn't awful either. I can actually say that about most of the movie. While the movie isn't ""good"" it doesn't really do anything to annoy or make you want to stop watching. The movie seemed to know what it was and didn't try to do too much, which is a rare thing lately. The only exception to that was the last two minutes, without trying to give anything a way it was a HUGE cop-out ending and the horrible beast was pretty much a dude in a swamp thing costume you can find at Walmart...other then the ending though this wasn't terrible. Overall, not as bad as I expected and if you are into cheesy movies this one will do. I give it a C+.",1348963200,3,1313,4.165354330708661

5038503,1,B006Z7Z3NG,"Wooden acting. Stupid story. Really ridiculous monster... Think guy in a black scuba suit with a fins glued to arm and legs,  expressionless face, and mouth so full of teeth that it neither opens or closes.",1392076800,,206,4.722222222222222

5038505,1,B006Z7Z3NG,"I like many horror movies and my daughter and I have gone to many since she was home.  Know I order them on line, because she is not with me.  The description on this movie sounded good, but after receiving and watching it, It was so phoney, I was sorry I paid the money I did for it.",1390521600,,284,3.8793103448275863
5038506,3,B006Z7Z3NG,"I think the movie was better than most low budget films. Thus, the movie was entertaining ; though it lacked potential as far as the creature is concern, it could have been a 5 start movie. The creature was not realistic looking at all; so someone told the truth about that. Then there was the lost of the son ; I felt like they lacked emotions and grievance. Great potential! I don't think, I could have watched it if it wasn't for the actors that are staring in this film. I wouldn't say it's a total lost of money, but the ending was horrible I will agree . Why couldn't this have been a zombie jumping from the water?",1389225600,,621,4.226890756302521
5038507,3,B006Z7Z3NG,It was okay for the money . The monster was awful it looked very fake . I liked looking at the background of the Great Sacandaga  Lake !,1373846400,2,136,3.857142857142857
5038508,3,B006Z7Z3NG,"A bit disappointing to see that the lake creature wasn't more realistic.  The acting by all of the actors was above average and the scenery added a touch of realism.  Now back to the so-called creature, after taking a couple of views of the creature you can tell that expense of the costume was not on the top of their budget list.  If nothing else was available for a Saturday evening, this movie will do as a backup to spending a night on the couch.",1370217600,,451,4.2823529411764705
5038509,3,B006Z7Z3NG,This movie was o.k. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it but if you are a prime member you can watch it for free if you need to kill some time.,1368316800,,141,3.896551724137931
5038510,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"Hmmmmm...what do I say about this movie they call HYPOTHERMIA. Well, lets just say that Jennyfly of JennyflyBlog.com picked this one for us to watch. (lol) Michael Rooker stars in this one - ya know...from THE WALKING DEAD - I'm guessing that's why she picked it. (lol) - Well...NO ZOMBIES IN THIS ONE. (lol)

Yeah people...this one's pretty blahh. Actually...from the start to the middle of the movie - - it's not THAT bad. We see that there's some weird stuff going on under the ice - - some people get attacked - - there's blood...THEN...the ending happens. We the viewers...finally see the creature. HOLY CRAP BALLS. Whyyyyy?!?!? They should've left it a mystery. (lol)

I give HYPOTHERMIA... 2 out of 5 popcorns!",1367971200,,717,4.821138211382114
5038511,5,B006Z7Z3NG,"The special effect were not that special. In particular, the monster could have been more monstrous: it looked like a scuba diver.  On the other hand, the screenwriters out did themselves in providing original resolutions to stock conflicts. In particular, the ending suprised me.",1366070400,2,280,5.363636363636363
5038512,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"This movie was marginally OK but I would suggest renting or streaming it which I did. Weak characters who basically deserve what ever happens to them because they are idiots! Kind of a lame story line too, all of a sudden there is a creature in a lake that wasn't there before huh?? Watch at your own risk!",1364947200,,306,4.293103448275862
5038513,1,B006Z7Z3NG,"I bought this at Target so this review is about the film and not any Amazon seller(s) and, having owned it less than four hours and watched in dismay as a couple of good performances and atmosphere were dragged down into the abyss of this lake-O- crap, I can safely say (warn) that you should not buy, rent, borrow, steal or brush up against this waste of time and money. Michael Rooker does admirably in his roll as do a couple of the bit players and the frigid atmosphere of a deep winter Maine ice-fishing outing is well photographed. However .... there was some seriously ham-fisted acting, too obvious attack opportunities, a laughable ""creature"" that will be familiar to any one who watched the classic  'The Outer Limits' series and any cheap-o creature feature from the 50's - 60's that utilized a guy in a frogman suit with fins taped on and ping-pong balls used as eyes and - then - there's a hilarious' talking the monster down' epilogue. If the producers and creature (guy in ridiculous rubber suit) effects crew had put their hearts and another few thousand bucks into this, even with some shoddy acting, this could have been a righteously classic cult creature film.

 Sad to see the efforts of a couple of good performances sunk so deep in this clunker. Do not waste your time or money.

I guess I could have just said ""It sucks!'",1359072000,4,1345,4.591666666666667
5038514,4,B006Z7Z3NG,"I've been waiting for this for nearly three years.

Compared with the same company's ""The Innkeepers"", and ""Stake Land"", I consider this the best; ""The Innkeepers"" being dethroned due to me overrating it or because it doesn't stand up to repeat viewings (although due to problems on my Innkeepers disk really it bears mentioning, thank the Lord the disk worked at all!)

Now, this movie - it was good, but there's more worth mentioning with the negatives. The good being, it was quite generic, yet solid with interesting characters. Even the obnoxious jerk behaves like he's unaware people are viewing him as one. What might interest people is the families band together to catch the monster before finding out that it's lethal instead of for survival. A saying I'm unsure of the original source, was something about leaving the audience wanting more, and I would've enjoyed seeing these characters more.

The negatives - besides being anticlimactic there's something that keeps happening in the movies this company produces, which is quite atypical of normal horror, but I kinda know it's going to happen. I had some suspicions of who would die, which were technically inaccurate in the details but in general fell within the expected parameters.

There's alternate artwork on the inside of the cover, which seems more appropriate for a film like this and should've been the front cover.

MINOR SOAPBOX:

One other issue: some people had issues with the monster effects. The monster was onscreen for maybe three minutes total. Frankly I can't consider that a significant issue, and don't understand why anyone would, especially since, well...

I've left the immature/borderline trolling ""Jaws"" review I'd written from 2006 untouched to highlight that I've matured over the years.

I consider it a good film though. BUT reportedly, Spielberg feared that the effects would his career. If special effects which feature little meant that much, ""Jaws"" would terrible... right?

 Please utilise THE COMMENTS BOX if you think I'm missing something with that logic.",1357689600,6,2058,5.171686746987952
5038515,3,B006Z7Z3NG,"First off, I liked the monster. He has a few genuine jump scares and he looks cool running at the camera when he's lit with flashlights at night.  Michael Rooker seemed very restrained in his actions, almost sedated. People who know his as  ""Merle"" from The Walking Dead would be surprised to see how he behaves here. Not a bad movie at all, shot at an interesting location. I would have liked a little bit more history about the monster, like a scene where the characters sit around and tell stories of local sightings or disappearances, or maybe a flying saucer that takes off at the end.",1357430400,,590,4.5046728971962615
5038516,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"It was poorly made with a poor plot and bad acting. The so called monster was like one from the 1940s or 1950s. It was a struggle to watch it to the end. The only thing that made sense was the title, "" Hypothermia"".",1355961600,,215,3.909090909090909
5038517,1,B006Z7Z3NG,I was ok with this movie until they revealed the monster. I was also confused about when they got bit. Did that mean they changed into the monster? They never went into that. This was a strange movie,1355961600,,199,4.2631578947368425

5038521,2,B006Z7Z3NG,"HYPOTHERMIA is one of those ""creature features"" that would have been more successful had the film gone more humorous or campy.  Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver's suit!
Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes.  Blood and gore are utilized but tame compared to current standards.  At only 73 minutes, HYPOTHERMIA passes quickly, so it might work as a double bill on Halloween!",1350000000,3,592,5.2105263157894735
8506775,3,B006Z7Z3NG,"I enjoyed this movie, it was pretty decent. The storyline was a bit different for these type of horror movies, it's not often that a story dwells on a bunch of people fond of ice fishing. Oh, and there being a monster underneath that nobody seems to recognize the fact that there's no fish that big in a frozen lake! But not to worry, folks, because ""it's only a flesh wound"" and there's no need to see a doctor, all of that blood you see from ""a flesh wound"" doesn't mean a thing. Makes you wonder how any of them were able to survive considering how willfully blind most of them tended to be.",1529366400,,594,4.219298245614035
