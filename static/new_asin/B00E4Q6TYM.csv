5890194,2,B00E4Q6TYM,"Just purchased this today as I'd seen some of the featured movies and liked them. It's a great deal getting 12 movies for $18. I just wasn't happy when I opened the case and saw the discs are double sided. I've purchased quite a few movies over the last 12 or so years and in my experience the double sided discs do not last long. I have found myself repurchasing movies that came on double sided discs.

Even though my dvd set was new when I opened it the discs had smudges and light scratching.

My advice would be to find the titles you like and purchase them individually or the lifetime movies that come 2-3 in a package.",1381536000,311,626,4.2521008403361344

5890211,1,B00E4Q6TYM,"I usually refer to Lifetime as the Men Are Scum network. The male characters in these movies are sub-betas, tending towards omegas. The first two movies in this package are tolerable. The 4th, A Christmas Wedding is incredibly stupid, while the 10th, Deck the Halls, rips off Shop Around the Corner, and is filled with unlikeable, unsympathetic characters.",1481587200,,356,5.155172413793103

5890216,1,B00E4Q6TYM,"I typed into my search engine the name of the 2015 Lifetime movie I want to buy and the first thing that pops up us Amazon's HALLMARK movies.  I had to search to find LIFETIME.  This is the only one that comes up.  I have most of these movies on individual DVDs and I love them, but I want to add new movies to my collection and found none.  The previous reviewers are right, these are crap.  I know because I picked it up for $5 NOT from Amazon.  Lifetime store isn't any better.  Apparently, you have to wait several years before they sell them on DVD.  Possibly because they will televise them ad nauseum during December and if they sell them on DVD, they'll lose viewers.  AND you will have to watch them with commericals.  At least you can fast forward through the commericals if you DVR it.",1479254400,,796,4.281879194630872
5890217,3,B00E4Q6TYM,"As others have said, these are not presented in widescreen versions as the product description would indicate. That said, because most of these movies were not filmed in widescreen format to begin with as made-for-TV movies or filmed before widescreen became the norm, the problem is really with marketing errors. The selection of movies is good and you get 12 films for $9.99 (at the time of this review) but the discs are not really high quality and some of them skip. I thought, at first, that maybe some of them didn't ""agree"" with a particular dvd player so I tried them in another and they skip in the same places so those defects are in the actual discs. I mean, I'm kind of meh about this, but since each film comes out to roughly .83 per movie, I feel kind of stupid complaining that much. You get what you pay for I guess.

Hard to tell but I think the quality of the transfer (or whatever you would call it on a DVD print) is not up to the original quality. They looked worse on one of my TVs than the other so I don't want to call this set out officially for low quality because I'm not 100% sure, but my feeling is that at least some of the original quality has been lost in translation.

Anyway, it's not totally awful but you'd think that these modern movies would look a little bit better than they do.

Buy at your own risk!",1479168000,10,1341,4.271653543307087

5890222,4,B00E4Q6TYM,"There are many good films on this set.  My favorite was ""A Christmas Wedding"" which is reason enough to buy this set.  ""Under the Mistletoe"" is very good but of you recently lost someone it will be hard to watch. ""Holiday Wishes"" is a great family film but only of you have girls.  Boys will hate it.  To me out of all the films in this set it is the most memorable and quit a surprise. However one of these films is worth watching.  I say buy this set and lend them out for other people to enjoy",1470528000,6,496,4.020408163265306

Of course, for the money, you couldn't expect more.  After watching only the first three of these movies, I can definitely state that these are the most poorly written, terribly directed, low budget movies I have ever watched.  As expected,most of the actors are unknown, with the exception of a couple, of over-the-hill, actresses who probably needed the work and would accept an acting job, anywhere, anytime.  These movies certainly are not worth suffering through the time it takes to watch them.  I just donated the DVD to a nursing home, in my  neighborhood, where the audience has plenty of time to watch, and waste, viewing these movies.",1417824000,,787,4.708029197080292

Sure, they are a little bit hokey and unrealistic, but I enjoy the romance, holiday themes and, of course, the happy endings. There are two movies on each disc with a total of six DVDs in a standard size case. It can be difficult to read the movie names because the titles are written in very small lettering near the center of each disc. Aside from this drawback, this is a great set of romantic Christmas movies. My favorite is ""Road to Christmas"" with Jennifer Gray.

Seriously, these movies are broadcast in HD and widescreen yearly and look much better than the old square TV ratio and awful low resolution on these cheaply produced discs.  This is NOT a bargain.  They look MUCH better when broadcast on TV.  I fell for this same scam last year when a bunch of these movies were packaged and listed on Amazon as being in widescreen and they were all square and low quality.  Amazon lists these movies as widescreen and 1.85 aspect ratio.  Every one of them here is the old square 1.33 TV ratio.  They're broadcast widescreen on TV but they're not here, and the picture quality is not as good either, so they look better on TV than on these discs.
