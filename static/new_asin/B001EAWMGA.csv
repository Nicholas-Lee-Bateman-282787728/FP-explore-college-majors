3547643,5,B001EAWMGA,Great Sci-Fi Movie! I feel that I was very lucky to see it the theater and the critics saw something else. Fantastic blend of Sword and Science Fiction! See and judge this film for yourself. It should have been in wider release and given time for it's audience to find it.,1242000000,3,272,4.352941176470588
3547644,5,B001EAWMGA,"I didn't know what to expect from this when i found it but i'm glad i did.
Good old fashioned action film with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure.
Great acting,likeable characters ,excellent alien creature and effects.
Pretty much everything anyone can ask for.",1239494400,5,270,4.76595744680851

3547646,5,B001EAWMGA,"Vikings against Aliens?  How cool is that?  I thought the movie was well done, certainly well, well above the level of a Sci-Fi Channel movie.  The acting was good. We actually come to care about the characters. The sets and atmosphere were cool.  The monster looked a little CGI-ish but who cares?  It's a really solid movie if you like this sort of thing.  A worthy addition to the tradition of the first Predator movie, certainly.  The movie also evoked for me ROAD WARRIOR (outsider comes to save them and the outsider is befriended by a boy) and PLANET OF THE APES (not the Tim Burton disgrace).  It evokes a lot of good stuff but has it own identity as a film.  I just totally dug this.  I know the movie has some baggage but it would be great to see some sequels.  There is definitely room for more and hopefully not just rehashes of the first one. There is more to this movie than people would think.  Thumbs up!",1239235200,7,920,4.347058823529411
3547647,5,B001EAWMGA,"The plot of this movie has been well described. I guess my liking it is a matter of taste. It doesn't try to be anything profound, but the attention to science fictional detail won me over. In fact I was sold on it in the first five minutes when we see Kainen has to be taught Norse by a dangerous and painful machine learning technique - imagine that, a universe where everyone does **not** speak American English!!! Apart from that you have brave hero, spunky heroine, 'orrible monster (excellent CGI) and reasonably non-insulting picture of Viking society. Hell, 5 out of 5.",1237680000,5,577,4.666666666666667
3547648,4,B001EAWMGA,"I got a chance to see this in the theatres thanks to a friend of mine with a sharp eye. It was only released in a VERY limited engagement - in my area, only one theatre ran it for a week. What a shame!
This movie is a must-see for fans of sci-fi movies like the first Terminator, movies like Ice Pirates, or Pitch Black. It has its own wonderful mythology, and the casting is great. Could've seen more of Ron Pearlman, though.
Yes, there are a couple of cheesy moments, but the good stuff far outweighs the bad. Very very enjoyable film. Looking forward to a disc release, and hopefully an extended edition - rumor has it that Weinstein and Co trimmed 15 min off the end to make the movie fit on one less reel, saving money.",1236124800,140,724,4.215827338129497
3547649,4,B001EAWMGA,"Like Antonio Banderas in ""The 13th Warrior"" and Director Robert Zemeckis in his 2008 CGI film, ""Outlander"" takes on the classic tale of Beowulf, but unlike those films it does it with a sci-fi twist. The ""Grendel"" monster in this film has celestial origins much like the titular Outlander played by Jim Caviezal. The monster design was one of the most pleasantly surprising aspects of the film; its look was unique and had the right mix of cool and creepy.

Some drawbacks to this film include a few flashback scenes with weak CGI, relatively uncharismatic male leads, and a few odd casting choices--John Hurt as a Viking king? In contrast the wonderful Ron Perlman was cast perfectly yet sorely underused. Those complaints aside, ""Outlander"" is overall a tightly paced, action packed, and entertaining take on the English language's oldest adventure tale.",1235865600,130,856,5.070921985815603
3547650,5,B001EAWMGA,"This was an entertaining spin on the Beowulf story. It had mostly everything the original Beowulf story had but added new twists to the storyline. It was very entertaining and was pretty intelligent as most action stories go. Very good CGI to carry off the special effects and some good actors to carry the plot.

It wasn't mindless or formulaic as most other action movie plots. I actually enjoyed watching it and found it interesting. I would recommend it on a dreary, rainy day when there are no ball games to watch. Enjoy!",1234828800,4,526,4.655913978494624
3547651,5,B001EAWMGA,"Vikings and aliens together would generally be a bad movie on the sci fi channel. but this was actually very good. of course there is a little cheesiness, but the special effects and decent acting make up for it. this movie was the most entertaining movie i have seen in a long time. it reminded me of predator alot.",1234828800,49,316,4.372881355932203
3547652,4,B001EAWMGA,"Based on the cover alone, it would be really easy to write this movie off as just another space horror movie.

Not even a ""so bad, it's good"" film that can give you some laughs. The premise isn't terrible, and the acting is passable at times (Hurt), but the overwrought script and the portrayal of dark ages Scandinavia sure does leave a lot to be desired.

Space traveler has an uninvited guest on board, an alpha predator called the Moorwen (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Alpha Predator precedes to wreck the place & considers all its inhabitants its personal buffet. Space traveler smooths out his initial issues w/ the indigenous population & they band together to fight the Alpha Predator (it is a pretty cool monster I must say).

Regular swords are no match for the predator so space traveler has some 'special' stuff on board to forge swords that will be effective against the Alpha Predator. Ron Perlman has a few scenes too. This is worth a rent, at least. :)",1513987200,,699,4.776859504132231
3547705,5,B001EAWMGA,"I enjoyed this sci-fi fable about space travel and the Vikings. The film has lots of fighting, a love interest and love triangle, a woman warrior, a non-sexual affection between a man and a young orphan boy, decisions necessary as to who will succeed the king of a Viking tribe, likable Vikings, good people dying, a super powered beast that devoirs humans, and more.
A soldier from out of space crashes to earth in Norway during the Iron Age. He had been part of his planets war against a planet inhabited by beasts. His people went to war solely because they wanted more land. Unfortunately for him and the Vikings, one of the beasts hid on board his ship, and after the crash, the beast began to kill Vikings. Our space traveler decides to try and help the Vikings even though he lost all of his advanced weapons.

Within 5 minutes of the opening, Jim himself drops the ""F"" bomb. What a loss of a  good and excellent Christian Character - and that is exactly what one should expect from Holy-wood. Then of course there were very disrespectful allusions to Christ and his sacrifice.  Not only that but the gore - a creature is shown eating a man while he is still alive. I couldn't watch anymore, so I don't know how it ended.

Any godly man would never appear in a movie such as this. Jim Caviezel - a big loss for a testimony of what Jesus can do for a man. Now, I have already been shown the error of my ways by Jim's fans.

Out of frustration I said a few off-color phrases and moved on. Later, I reconsidered. There are some very notable actors in it. From what I've seen, I like Jim Caviezel's performance, so I decided to give this film a try. I really enjoyed it. The characters are about as well developed as they can get in a two-hour movie.

3547755,5,B001EAWMGA,"If you're looking for authentic Old Norse genre violently contrasted by Space Alien Glowing Ravenous Fire Dragon Monster, this is your film.

I bought it thinking I'd not seen it, but nope, 2nd viewing for me but dimly recalled at first with ever the more familiarity as the film progressed.  That dampened my attentiveness.  But hey, great effects, solid acting from a well cast crew.  A bit, okay, a lot too long.  Maybe too many characters sussed out.

More of a horror flick than Sci-Fi, but not too bad for the SF parts.  Future me: watch it again but only if you forget it again.

The film has some weaknesses, such as sub-par character development, incomplete backstory, etc. I also had a feeling that the film was released prematurely and needed some tweaks to some of the plot details and ending cut.

3547767,5,B001EAWMGA,"This is not to be confused with the TV series, but is an excellent SciFi film. A spaceship returning from a planet where settlers have been killed by a creature called a Morwen crashes to Earth when it's discovered the monster is onboard. Only Kainan escapes. He sets up a homing device to signal for rescue, then with the help of equipment salvaged from the ship, learns in short order that he's in Iron Age Norway, and is given a 3-minute lesson in Norwegian.  Then he's on his way to fall in love with a viking chief's daughter, name friends with the man courting her, and killing the Morwen.

The entire movie is formulaic and we know what's going to happen right up to the end, but it's so good...who cares?  Jim Cavaziel looks a bit out of place at first but he soon settles into the part.  John Hurt seems to be stuck in these father-figure but still active roles, but it's a good fit., and Ron Perlman was great but almost unrecognizable this time around.

The scenery is beautiful, the sets and costumes authentic-looking (except for all those shaven heads.)

All in all, this is a very good movie, well-written, well-acted, authentically costumed, and it's too bad it didn't get a wider distribution in theaters.

Also, the crash-landed alien did not impress me - his crashed, sinking ship conveniently provided him with a ""burn the language and culture of some obscure backwater planet into your brain""-o-matic, a gun...and nothing else. When he and his dead friend surface from the wreck, they are wearing super-spiffy space armor...that he immediately takes off because honestly, why would you want armor in a world of violent iron-age natives and unknown, possibly hostile beasts?

The actors were excellent, the direction was good the cutting was seamless.  If the budget had allowed for a little more polish and maybe more time to fully realize the characters it would be a 5 star classic.  As is, it is a 4 star potential classic.  It has some fantasy violence and a little gratuitous blood.

Sophia Miles made a great leading lady and managed to look absolutely beautiful without having to take her clothes off. Imagine that.

If you don't know video games, you'll like this if you're into medieval themed fighting.  The sci-fi element with the dragon and outlander are ever present but not the main element of the movie, so you'll definitely want to have an interest in some good ol' fashioned sword fighting.  Fun, original mix of genres, additionally raised great questions about morality, leadership and violence.  The graphics are good too.

As far as the Ender's Game twist goes, they should have either ""owned it"" completely or left it out. It was a horrible monster that showed no signs of any thoughts other than killing. What was the fifteen minutes of guilt about? They eradicated giant dragon rats. Finally, this was devoid of any science so let's just call it some sort of period horror fiction.

and it smells like death - Kainan

Outlander is a superb SciFi film that many may have missed, or got confused with a certain time-traveling nurse, or got buried in the SciFi B movie list but it is a superb film with great acting and CGI that fits the time and the storyline. NORWAY in the year 709 is in the midst of a violent, warlike time of brutality. A star falls from the sky, a ship containing a humanoid, an Outlander, with advanced technology and a deadly passenger. The race is on to convince the local leader that they are in grave jeopardy, but there is a backstory. Starring Jim Caviezel (Person of Interest, Passion of the Christ), Sophia Myles, John Hurt (Alien), Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast), and John Huston, this is well worth watching. Directed by Howard McCain. Disliked by critics and loved by SciFi fans. Very Definitely Recommended. Four ENTERTAINING Stars! (The Weinstein Company. Time-1 hour, 55 minutes. Color. CC. Rated R for violence.)",1442620800,,971,4.711764705882353

The Blue Ray version is rated R and is only 92 minutes, while the DVD version is unrated and the run time is 115 minutes.
I take it that parts of the Blue Ray version were cut out, but for what reason?

Is there an extended Blue Ray version to purchase?

I'm giving it 5 stars for what it is. A B movie. The name of the movie might throw you off. Odd similarity with Highlander. The Sci-Fi classification might throw you off. Sci-Fi and Vikings? Right ... Even the start of the movie might throw you off. Just get past the first 30 minutes or so and you will at least have a good B grade horror flick. Where this shines though, is the whole thing. The acting, the scenery, the story. It was Grendel done as it should be.

3548036,4,B001EAWMGA,"This could have been a huge blockbuster - I'm not sure why it wasn't advertised more. It is an action film and for what it is, it does it well. It's one of those movies where I want to clap at the end because it has this big dramatic feel to it. (Yeah, I'm a dork.) It also unexpectedly had a moral of some sort. Without giving the plot away, the monsters were given a very sympathetic backstory. Usually with these sorts of movies it's a clearcut good guy vs bad monster, but here I felt bad for the monster and at the same time understood why they needed to kill it. It made it kind of hard to cheer for one side, which is actually pretty thoughtful for what would otherwise be a straightforward mindless action flick.

Anyway, things I liked:
- good special effects that didn't overwhelm the story
- the story itself was interesting
- cool monsters

Things I didn't like:
- the lead actor is a bit wooden and it would've been better with someone more charismatic
- excessively gory (do we need to see blood spurting out of a guy's head after it's cut off?)

Things you might want to know:
- pretty cliched
- very violent

3548044,3,B001EAWMGA,I feel like this movie would have been better without the main character. He's some alien that comes to help some Vikings kill an alien dragon thing. It would have been much better if the alien dragon came and the Vikings had the deal with him. He was a know it all from space who has a sword and knows how to use it. While obviously his people have long since evolved out of the need for swords. Not only that but the dragon was a wild animal yet was capable of doing things that only sentient beings can doing. Like break out of space jail and force a craft to crash land on a habitable planet only so it can be a wild animal again. Come on! But the movie looked nice and the supporting cast did a great job. Too bad the main actor did not. Every time the movie started to get good he popped up and just ruined many scenes. I do recommend it for a watch if you are bored. It isn't as bad as the great many bad B movies being made. I'd say this is a B+ movie.,1420156800,,960,3.928205128205128

If you enjoy those things, and have a good sense of not taking things to seriously (go flash go), you should enjoy.  And don't get me wrong, its not a comedy (but it does have humor) or a silly movie, I think of it as a solid sci-fi, but if you are a bit picky, well, then who can say.  If it was just horror, I'd be less interested, but with the sci-fi background/concept, it really got my interest.  And sci-fi doesn't have to be what you see or what they do in the movie, it's a concept, for me it worked great.  and I have to say, when the creature lights up at night, its AWESOME.  Either way, a very enjoyable movie.

Towards the end of the movie the hero makes a weapon out of the material from his own land my problem is the material looks very plasticky and not very sturdy or well formed.

If it weren't for the gore it would really just be a Disney movie for 10 year olds. I can usually spot a bad ""medieval"" movie when all of the main characters are very good looking with exceptional hygiene, flawless skin, and top notch dental plans (even in Viking times). The main character is a spaceman who also knows martial arts, is immediately skilled with a Viking sword, can conveniently speak the language fluently, is an exceptionally strong swimmer, and ends up with the really hot Viking babe right from the start. The action scenes make this movie barely watchable despite being completely implausible, even for fantasy.

I realize that some of it is in Gaelic, which few people speak anymore.  BUT even the rest of the conversation is almost impossible to understand.  I lived in a British crown colony for almost 10 years and watch many British TV shows, so it's not that I am unschooled in British accents.  In order for this to be a real hit, STARZ needs to add English to the subtitles.

The reason I watch this movie in the first place was because of the sound track.  It was mind blowing and I was hooked.  I would recommend this movie,1404432000,,266,3.9245283018867925

3548132,4,B001EAWMGA,Definitely a science  fiction movie. Basically it is an Alien vs. Vikings type movie. Not much more to say about it.,1403308800,,116,4.523809523809524
3548133,5,B001EAWMGA,I love Jim Cazivel (sp) and Sophie Miles were great in this show.  I don't usually go for monster shows but this is great show!,1403308800,,127,4.08
3548134,2,B001EAWMGA,"I bought Outlander based on all the five-star reviews here on Amazon. It has now dawned upon me, the people here have seemingly watched a different movie than Outlander. For one hour and ten minutes of this film, HALF the movie, absolutely nothing is happening. No character building, no action, nothing but filler dialog that has no bearing on what's happening. I now see why I have never heard of this movie.

Does the other one hour redeem the film? sadly no. While the action picks up, we still know almost nothing about the characters to even care when they die. Jim Caviezel doesn't help the movie with his mediocre, almost monotone acting, the only one who seems to be doing a good job is John Hurt whose character is a complete mystery. The only thing we know about John is that he is King. This film has zero character building.

The Monster is composed of cheap CGI, which in a few years will look laughable (already does) compared to even the cheapest of CGI by that time. The DVD is anamorphic at least, Warner calls ""Matted"" 1.85.1 but this movie is 2.35.1 -- an obvious misprint.
I'm not telling you not to buy and watch it, simply telling you what to expect. If you make it past an hour and ten minutes without falling asleep, you did better than I and I'm a big fan of Science Fiction. There is no way I could watch it again, I'm sorry. I give it a 2 out of 5.",1403308800,,1376,4.329457364341085

3548136,5,B001EAWMGA,"I absolutely loved this movie!  I didn't find any of the special effects ""cheesy"" as some people put it. Bottom line, it was a great story, with great acting. I've watched it many times, and will watch it again soon!!",1403049600,,217,4.425

3548149,5,B001EAWMGA,"Myles and Caviezel make this work.  Others less so, but style

3548151,4,B001EAWMGA,For a nondescript sci-fi movie it is not bad.  Not great but not bad.  The idea of a humanoid alien just happening to land among a group of Norsemen is a intriguing plot twist.  Of course all movies like this use a hard to kill alien as a plot device.  Caviezel is okay as the protagonist.  It is worth a Saturday night.,1399075200,,320,4.096774193548387

Where the ""advanced alien in modern or near modern timeline"" story has been done over and over, this story has our alien traveler marooned in the iron age.  Combine this with a moralistic battle between protagonist humans and the beast from another planet.  A manifest destiny parallel is explored and while the graphic killings by the beast tend to rally the viewer to the human plight.  The beast can be forgiven in its actions as its home has been stolen away",1398470400,,501,4.724137931034483

If you can swallow the premise, this movie brings sci-fi and fantasy together in a brilliant little romp of clever storytelling. The pacing is good, the dialogue spot-on, and discarding the few storytelling liberties (like ignoring the melting temperature of high-grade steel) is not difficult.

Jim Caviezel is handsome as always and the beautiful Sophia Myles has noticed the new stranger in this little Viking town in Norway.  Little does she know that he is from another planet!  Cliff Saunders is hilarious as the boisterous Boromir.  This film has some funny moments but it is not a comedy.  It also has some romance and some good old fashioned Viking battle scenes!

The film also has some fantastic special effects and some computer aided set design that is very believable and sometimes quite beautiful when used to enhance the outdoor settings.  I highly recommend this film... you will enjoy it!",1392681600,,785,4.813432835820896

3548195,4,B001EAWMGA,"Taking into consideration, the money spent on production, the budget, and all the internals, if you're fair-minded about it, the actors did an excellent job with a moderately interesting story.  The highest compliment I can offer goes to the thoughtfulness and wholeness of the storyline. The story was written and re-written many times before the final cut. I could have written more drama into the story without losing the characters or suspense of disbelief. The absence of raw sexuality was a waste because you've got this beautiful man with several gorgeous compliments and, didn't see enough of them. An asymmetrical ""youth"" substitute was a lot of gore which I find boring.
Comparatively though, Outlander deserves kudos for not going over-the-top. The story was tight, the acting was really very good. I do have a terrible feeling that the ""5 Star"" wonder of this film was sacrificed by a Christian Conservative producer or writer who did everything they could to make it a biblical story about the modern American Family--Their own version, of course. You know, the typical Christian attempt at world entertainment where there's only one token black (or none), the women are slaves, the guy always does the saving for a child and no hint anywhere of a gay person male or female. That made it rather plain and stale and overly-predictable, with an agenda.",1391644800,,1363,5.030973451327434

3548209,4,B001EAWMGA,"Like the epic legend, this is also suspenseful.  On a very human level, it's about a bereaved veteran, who while he's a stranger, adopts an earthly family.  Perhaps it resonates well with the Beowulf story because the English translation I studied in high school failed to translate any coherent description of Grendel's appearance.  Video depictions I've watched of Beowulf alternately substituted a giantish troll, or elsewhere a dragon.  Then again, thanks to the influence of J.R.R. Tolkien, it's hard not to imagine him as Beowold.

At the end of the movie I was just shaking my head and imagining events just like these might have been the original seed of the legend.

  Cavil is one of my favorites for two reasons 1. Monte Christo and 2. Jesus. Well, here its like he doesn't exist, but I can't blame him. His character is cold, doesn't talk that much so you cannot relate nor sympathize with him.
  From that point on I think that the story as a story is not that bad but the problem is in the script. uninteresting dialogues, boring characters and sometimes stupid scenes which make no sense.
  Effects are acceptable and so is the direction in a mediocre atmosphere which sometimes is good, sometimes feels weird like out of place.
  Some people might like it(hardcore fantasy-sci-fi fans) but I think its one of the worst movies I saw this year together with this is the end which for some reason everybody praised!

3548300,5,B001EAWMGA,"A great movie for any die-hard sci-fi fan! Let me start by saying that I had never heard of Outlander until a co-worker had mentioned it one day. As he gave me a breakdown, I thought, ""Wow, it sounds like a play on Beowulf!"". But I was skeptical at first because my friend loved cheesy, low budget, Sci-fi Channel B movies. I finally caught it on Sci-fi one day and was really shocked at how good the movie is! Is it Oscar material? Well no, but it is well written and actually doesn't fall flat on it's face for sci-fi plausibility. Is the CGI cutting edge? Well no, but it's done well and I've seen worse on bigger budget films. The scenery is down right beautiful and they actually constructed a believable Viking village for this movie. The acting is actually handled really well with the exception of Ron Perlman. I really wanted to like him in this movie and for some of it I did. However, the biggest complaint I have is he couldn't keep his ""Viking"" accent straight through the entire movie. Jim Caviezel played a good hero, a bit flat, but it helped separate him from the rest of the cast who were all ""Vikings"". John Hurt did a fine job as the village king and brought a lot of experience to the movie with his part. The creatures were ""scary"" and as the movie progresses, you can actually attempt to sympathize with them. I would say about the only plot hole I really had a problem with was when the ""Outlander"" retrieves a piece of his space faring ship for Iron Age Vikings to forge new weapons out of.

3548306,4,B001EAWMGA,"Outlander(released July/08) stars,among others Jim Caviezel as Kainan,Sophia Myles as Freya,Jack Huston as Wulfric,John Hurt as Hrothgar,Cliff Saunders as Boromir,and Ron Perlman as Gunnar. This is a story set in Nordic lands long ago,and it successfully combines a futuristic flavour to the mix to create a surprisingly good and solid film.
The story finds us in the early part of the 8th century in Norway. A spaceship,from parts unknown,crashes into a remote lake there. Out comes two of its passengers and one perishes. It seems their world tried to colonize another planet that was inhabited by creatures called Morwen's,that looked like dragons of our folklore. They tried to exterminate them,but they were unsuccessful in getting them all and one got on board Caviezel's ship which wreaked havoc,causing his abrupt crash landing on Earth. Caviezel is the one who remains alive,and after a quick update on his location and the history of the Earth and its language(they obviously had been here before),Caviezel sets off to explore his surroundings. He comes upon a village that has been recently razed to the ground,but he is soon taken prisoner. The head of a local Viking tribe(Hurt)accuses him of killing the entire village. Caviezel claims he is hunting for a dragon but is laughed at.
Since the village that was razed,was under the auspices of another local tribe king(Perlman),Hurt is afraid that he will blame their tribe for killing his. However before he can send word Perlman and his minions come a-calling,with a raid on Hurt's village. The attack is repelled but Perlman and his men are set for another attack not far away. Before they can carry it out the Morwen jumps them and they flee towards Hurts village. Only a handful manage to make it inside and all get to see first hand that the Morwen is now the real culprit in the village razing and the deaths of the people. Caviezel is slowly welcomed into Hurts tribe and with his help they will try to capture and kill the Morwen.
A large trench is dug out,surrounded by a wooden pen filled with flammable whale oil. They lure the creature into it and set it ablaze. For the moment it looks like the creature is finally dead,but the women,all huddled in large hut,are being attacked by a younger and smaller Morwen. As the men rush to save them the big/mother Morwen leaps from the fire,wreaks havoc and flees,killing Perlman and taking the kings daughter. Caviezel realizes their metal swords aren't strong enough and he dives to his sunken ship to retrieve stronger material. They use it to forge new weapons and they drop down into the village well which leads them into a vast cavernous area. They follow their noses which leads them to the Morwen's lair. They first encounter the smaller Morwen whom they eventually dispatch. The final battle comes down to Caviezel hanging on for dear life over the edge of a precipice,with the Morwen holding onto his one arm. With a final swipe of his sword,the Morwen falls to its death.
Caviezel returns to a homing beacon he had originally set up. As a search and rescue ship comes within viewing range he destroys the beacon,which leaves him deliberately stranded. He returns to the village and becomes its king. Unbeknownst to Caviezel,the kings daughter had followed and witnessed his destroying of the beacon and the spacecraft over head. This secret she will take to her grave.
The story has just enough of a unique twist on things as to keep one interested throughout. The acting is solid all around,especially with John Hurt and Ron Perlman. Mr. Perlman's appearance as the rival Norse king is all too short,but being the good actor he is,he makes the most of it. Caviezel doesn't make the most charismatic of leading men,but his shortcomings are covered rather well by the supporting cast. The special effects were particularly well done and the scenery is to die for. It was shot in Canada's maritimes,with Gros Morne Provincial Park(a UNESCO heritage site)in Newfoundland,front and center.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound here with 27(!)deleted and alternate scenes,commentary,animatics,visual effects tests and production design galleries.
All in all a surprisingly good film. The premise at first glance sounded a bit hokey,but the interesting plot along with the great cast elevated it above the average. 3 1/2-4 stars. Recommended.",1363478400,,4423,4.978378378378379

All of the acting is on point ,and combined with the scenery and plot, will really whisk you away  for an hour and fifty five minutes.  To be fair, there are some cheesy moments here and there, but it's important to suspend your disbelief, and open your self up to the experience of this film as a fan of phantasy, action, and mythology; and not watch it like a hasty critic picking out every tiny flaw.

It's masterfully written and has a moral message that is subtle, completely lacking the condescending club of a script that movies like ""Avatar"" regularly hit us over the head with.

I've rented some clunkers in my time and this ISN'T one of them. There is some gore, but it's mostly subdued and implied aside from a few key scenes. Considering the astonishing nature of the protagonist's opponent, it's amazing that the movie's violent scenes stayed reasonable. There is suspense here and an emotional roller coaster ride that continues to build and build, keeping you wondering how this will end.

A hideous monster that hides in the shadows/dark and uses tricks of light to hypnotize its prey.

 When it arrived it wouldn't play on my regular DVD player so I did some research and found that, even though the US and England are friends, DVDs from England only play on machines that are set to zone 2.
So I changed my computer to zone 2 in order to watch the movie. Afterward I changed my computer DVD player back to zone 1. A few days later I changed to zone 2 again to watch the movie but when I tried to change my computer back I realized that it had locked itself in zone 2 on the firmware.
Seems that you're only allowed to change the setting four times and THE INITIAL SETTING COUNTS AS NUMBER 1.

I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES NOW ON CABLE.  EVERYONE I KNOW WHO SEES IT IS IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS MOVIE. IT LOOKS LIKE A MAJOR PRODUCTION. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT DIDN'T BECOME MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE THEATERS.  ITS A DVD HIT.

3548347,4,B001EAWMGA,"In year 709 AD in Norway, in the kingdom of Herot (in fact hardly more than a village) during the reign of wise old king Hrothgar (John Hurt), a spaceship crashes. The pilot of the ship, a humanoid alien named Kainan (Jim Caviezel), survives - but so does a monstrous stowaway, an intelligent but extremely dangerous (and voracious) creature known to the aliens as a Moorwen. The Moorwen becomes fast the scourge of the kingdom and Kainan, after being caught by the Vikings, will have to help them in the hunt for the monster - something he is very eager to do, as there is bad blood between them...

That sounds like a scenario for a very stupid and cheap ""straight to DVD"" monster movie, but director Howard McCain, who also wrote the story, managed to make of it a surprisingly good and original film. He also received a 47 million USD budget and he handled it very well. Viking's village looks very credible, costumes and weapons were carefully made and Moorwen creature is really SCARY.

Although this is a SF film, the story was clearly inspired by ""Beowulf"". The name of king Hrothgar and the name of the country (Herot) both come from the poem. Also, exactly as in the poem King Hrothgar owns a large mead hall and at one moment a ""magic"" sword will appear. Moorwen is a voracious predator feasting on flesh of heroes, exactly as Grendel and Kainan is an outlander, coming from a distant realm, exactly as was Beowulf in the poem.

Dialogs are surprisingly good for a B-movie and actors did very well, including Ron Pearlman who plays Gunnar, the brutish king of neigbouring realm (in fact just another village). Sophia Myles who plays Freya, king Hrothgar's daughter (and of course Kainan's love interest) did also a good job as a cute damsel in just enough distress to attract a mate, but not enough to anger the feminists...))) A good thing in this film is also that some other Vikings (mostly Wulfric and Boromir) have also something to do and to say during the film - it is not the ""standard issue"" B-movie in which the hero does everything and everybody else does just figuration.

One element which I think was unnecessary was the presence in the village of a Christian priest (extremely unlikely in year 709) and his parodic presentation. This Christian bashing was the one thing that I really disliked in this film. On another hand, the ending was pretty good.

Also, unlike in most of this kind of films, towards the middle of the film we have an insight in the monsters's side of the story - and at that moment I started to feel some real pity for the Moorwen, even if clearly there was no peace possible between humans and him...

So bottom line, this is a very orignal, very interesting and pretty well made SF B-movie. I liked it and I keep my DVD to watch it again one day. Enjoy!",1354665600,,2803,4.551587301587301

3548355,5,B001EAWMGA,"Outlander was a fun watch!

Now, this is not an Oscar-type movie.  Nor does it have the detailed character interplay and development of a Jane Austin film.

But it is a highly entertaining sci-fi movie, set back in Viking days (an interesting twist), with a ""Predator"" type feel to it (even an alien ""dragon"")!  There's surprisingly good acting here, even when it's not Caviezel, interesting characters, actual character development, and man vs. man conflict as well as man vs. monster.  It's fast-paced, there's tons of action, the characters jump out from the screen as real people that you quickly come to care about, and there's even a small tint of romance.  For Jim Caviezel fans, here he is heroic and trustworthy and gallant, angst-ridden, and for those who appreciate this kind of thing, so very easy on the eyes.

It does dip into some gore, so to speak, from time to time.  The ""dragon"" is not tidy, and there is real swordplay with what are probably realistic results, blood and death-wise.  I'm not a big fan of gore myself, but this was within my boundaries.  However, I've observed my tolerance for this is a bit higher than some other women, so beware if the occasional severed arm would offend you.

My recommendation:  if you liked Alien, or Predator, and you enjoy a good sword-type movie (vs. guns) - get some friends together, hand out the popcorn, and enjoy the story!  For this genre, ""Outlander"" is at the top of it's class.",1351641600,2,1448,4.721115537848606
3548356,3,B001EAWMGA,"It's the classic story of a hero who arrives in a strange world and is bound to become the king even if he doesn't necessarily wishes so. You see it in the character of Aragorn in ""Lord Of The Rings"" and even with the character that Matt Damon plays in ""Good Will Hunting"". A man that others want to look up to. A man that others want to follow. But that man doesn't want it. That man is not ready for it. But in the end, he will become what he was born to be. Or destined. That concept always is a winner. And it is here too. It sure is a bit ""cheezy"" but it is done with good intentions. The creators really wanted to do a genuine good film. It's easy to see. For that, you feel compelled to appreciate the efforts.

You also feel like you want to forgive the quality of the special effects. This movie looks like an expensive B-Movie. You don't believe for a minute what you are seeing but what the heck, it's done with good intentions and with passion. So you choose to believe it and have fun. But just like all B-Movies, i couldn't help wondering what Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott would have done with it, with all of their talents, power and money. That's the curse of all B-Movies, i suppose.

Jim Caviezel is perfect in the role and so is the other actors and actresses. The only two complaints i have, even if it's a B-Movie and even if i really want to appreciate the efforts and passion, well my two complaints are with the make-up (the characters look a tad too ""modern"" for what you expect people from that period to look like) and the cliches (there are too many to make a list but let's just say that you always guess what's going to happen). But even within those cliches, i thought some of the story arcs were pretty interesting, like for instance, the enemy from the other tribe battling along with our heroes in order to defeat the monsters. I would have prefered that the Ron Pearlman character survives and becomes some kind of an important member of the tribe, though. But hey, this is a genuine good B-Movie. If you don't expect much and if you go in with the proper expectations, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

And a special note has to be given for the music. Geoff Zanelli, a clone of Hans Zimmer, one of his students rather, composed a hell of a score that is not original for one bit but that delivers nonetheless. You come out of it humming the main theme, wishing you'd be some sort of a hero yourself.

It quickly became obvious this was the founding idea for the FPS video game of the same name. To me, it simply came across as a potential FPS with many of the FPS trappings i.e., it could go on and on forever with no ""winner"" or end in sight and the main character could ""buy"" his armor (which he willingly gives up with no explanation early in the movie) and his ""lost"" weapon. For the most part, it was a good storyline as a basis for a FPS video game but it was lacking in the dialog and acting departments. Some may enjoy it.",1347148800,,696,4.2406015037593985
3548364,4,B001EAWMGA,"This is a great little film, with fine acting all around. Has enough of the sci-fi element to pull in folks like me, but mostly a toungue-in-cheek adventure movie that's just serious enough to not be ridiculous. The pulsing Moorwen was great, and while the movie was disjointed in the final act, I believe that was the result of poor editing and decisions by the production company, rather than the fault of the director, as everything flowed quite nicely at first. I've been a fan of Caviezel since Frequency, and his portrayal (which everyone seems to have forgotten!) of Edmond Dantes in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" captured that character perfectly (Guy Pearce was perfect as well). Ron Perlman is always amazing, and it is upsetting to me that with a little more effort, this could have been a great film. Perlman was about the only saving grace in that Nicholas Cage crapfest ""Season of the Witch"", but it went into wide release. Why not Outlander, which is a far superior film? Just glad to see Caviezel's career turning back around with ""Person of Interest"".",1347148800,,1066,4.767567567567568

3548367,5,B001EAWMGA,"I have read and studied Beowulf in the original Old English for 25 years now, and have composed my own Old English poem that was then featured on the web site of a professor of that literary genre.  I have often tried to imagine a modern treatment of that legend that I would consider faithful to the spirit of the original.  This is an especially difficult task for a movie, which is necessarily more tightly constrained than the written or recited word.

Those responsible for this movie have departed from a literal interpretation, but in doing so have formulated a plot that is credible within the context of the modern world.  The hero, Kainan, is indeed a being with otherworldly capabilities, but because he is a space traveller who has crash landed in Dark Age Scandinavia.  He must contend with a dragon-like monster that has followed him to Earth--and which threatens his newly adopted viking community.

Jim Caviezel is convincing as the Beowulf-like alien Kainan.  After all, this is the not the first messianic figure he has successfully portrayed!  As in the original Beowulf saga, the viking king is named Hrothgar; his daughter is named Freya (analogous to Freawaru in Beowulf).  Unferth is once again the name of the warrior who is the rival of Kainan/Beowulf.

To the inhabitants of this viking world, Kainen seemed sent by the gods.  It has been said that science passes for magic in the eyes of the uninitiated.

3548396,4,B001EAWMGA,"I'm not sure why this fine film didn't get a wide theatrical release; it could be that industry execs are still thinking that Jim Caviezal is typecast from his portrayal of Jesus in ""The Passion Of The Christ"".

Typecast or not, Jim Caviezal is a first-rate actor.  ""Outlander"" is a well-written film, but it's the kind of sci-fi adventure story that no actor goes into thinking that he'll get an oscar nod for his knock-your-socks-off great interpretation of his character ... because the characters, as written, really aren't anyone you haven't encountered before in similar films.

Paul Newman said, ""Give an actor a good script, and he can move the earth.""  Caviezal is living proof of this; what puts this particular film over the top, so to speak, is that Caviezal take a reasonably good script and adds a tremendous amount of depth to it.  Without any great monologues to work with, he creates the heart and soul of this script through his interactions with the other characters in the story, as a man from the future, learning to inhabit the past.  He is that rare actor who can successfully portray a quality of indomitability, whilst all the while seeming quite human, with no pretensions towards perfection.  Caviezal is fierce without being boorish or arrogant; and he's a man of flesh and blood, seemingly quite three-dimensional, without relying upon a ""tragic flaw"" to convince his audience that he's just as human as they are.

In this, as well as other films he's done, Jim Caviezal inhabits not just his character, but also has the dramatic ability to allow his character's culture to inhabit him.  Films like ""The Stoning of Soraya M."" and ""Frequency"" show clearly Caviezal's commitment to not just create the person, but to also give the audience an excellent sense of that person's era and culture, particularly in the way both of these express themselves in that person's speech, demeanor, and perspective.

Well, that gets tricky here, because Caviezal's character is from the future, and he must acclimate himself to a place in the distant past.  He becomes a hybrid of both worlds; there's just something in the way he behaves that portrays the influences of his own future culture, along with this new (to him anyway) environment of the past in which he should be a fish out of water, but instead he soon becomes a leader.

I won't bore you with a re-hash of the plot; read the synopsis if you're curious about that.  What I will tell you is that this is a good screenplay rendered into a fine film by the dramatic gifts of its star.

If you're either a sci-fi fan, or, just a Jim Caviezal fan, you'll like this.  What you'll also like is this:  As I'm writing this in April of 2012, principle photography is being shot on ""The Tomb"", in which Caviezal will star with Stallone and Schwarzeneggar; he'll play a prison warden.  If successful, hopefully the studio execs will be convinced that Caviezal can open films on his own; an actor with this kind of ability shouldn't be typecast or denied his just and due success.",1335225600,3,3045,4.7476280834914615

3548400,3,B001EAWMGA,"For me, the best part of the film is when Jesus drops the ""F-bomb"" about five minutes in. It was so shocking to hear the devinely devout Jim Caviezel spit it in such a completely convincing way that I actually laughed out loud.

I'm a huge fan of this genre and also a great fan of Caviezel, so when I saw this pop up I was curious enough to make an instant buy. I'm not sorry I did - very entertaining and an interesting premise. Cowboys v. Aliens only a bit further back in the timeline and with less technology.

There was a lot of silliness, some confusion and tons of cliches. Fortunately, the acting was actually very good, despite a level of predictability that should have been avoided and - with an obviously large budget - could have been. Unlike some reviewers, I think Caviezel's somewhat dry acting style of restraint and a steady confidence lends itself very well to being an action hero. I don't like my tough guys running around losing contol of themselves and overacting all over the place. Tall, cool ones always play it best. Jack Houston makes for a pretty and likeable right-hand man and Perlman and Hurt are seasoned pros who pull away from the pack in any scene they're involved with. A number of talented support cast add flavor and a dash of humor when they get the chance - which sadly isn't often enough.

The worst thing about this movie is the missed opportunity. I like a bit more Sci with my Fi, if you will.  To take an alien being with highly advanced technology and introduce him to the primitive Vikings should have provided a wealth of interesting situations, humor, wonder and ultimately a fantastic showdown. But it didn't. Instead, the alien/hero just becomes a regular old Viking, no cool stuff is introduced beyond the first ten minutes or so  (besides the monster and that's a given) and the whole thing kind of flatlines. There just isn't any growth to the story - it peaks early and then levels off. That's too bad and does a disservice to all of the hard work and money that was obviously put into this film.

Still, I watched it all and I liked it o.k. It was a decent movie - far better than quite a bit of the nonsense and garbage that gets dumped into the theaters these days. It was full of beautiful scenery, some pretty great fight scenes and some very talented actors. It's just a shame that there was such a lack of vision for the project as a whole, which plays itself out in the end when the production company pulled out with little or no promotion whatsoever. Missed opportunity, indeed.",1334707200,,2545,4.485961123110151

3548404,4,B001EAWMGA,"I was surprised when I turned on this movie to see a spaceship hurtling through the atmosphere, for glancing at the summary for the film on my online rental queue, it seemed like a costume drama. I almost turned it off after ten minutes but decided to stick with it a little longer and am glad I did. I'm not sure why Outlander didn't have a wide release and generate a substantial following, since it has all the elements needed for a great action film.

During the reign of the Vikings, a stranger from a distant land crashes in the middle of the lake. Kainan (James Caviezel) is haunted by the past but disconcerted to discover that his arrival coincides with the appearance of a new creature in the wood, a fire-breathing dragon-like lizard known as a Moorwen. At first he is believed to have had something to do with the murder of a neighboring village, but when he reveals knowledge of the dragon, he is taken before King Rothgar (John Hurt). Born of a dominating space race of super-advanced humans, Kainan inadvertently released the Moorwen from his ship when it went down. Now charged with the responsibility of helping hunt down and kill the monster he has unleashed on the Vikings, he finds an unlikely friendship with the future king, the courageous but somewhat rash Wulfric (Jack Hudson).

Rothgar's daughter Freya (Sophia Myles) is intrigued by this newcomer but as their first encounter included him knocking her unconscious, is not entirely convinced of his goodness, but as she comes to know him better, a flicker of romance ignites that might be threatened by the seemingly impossible task of destroying the Moorwen before it wipes them out. I confess that the first few minutes were rather strange and you would think sci-fi would not blend well in a middle ages setting, but I was surprised not only how quickly it convinced me of it, but what a fun movie it turned out to be. The characters are all interesting and likable in their own way. I was impressed with Wulfric in particular, since he could have easily been a ""villainous"" sort of character, but he is quick to accept Kainan and they even become friends. Their rivalry extends no further than a particularly amusing dinner scene in which they attempt to outdo one another's antics through various depictions of their battle skills.

Another thing I liked was that the romance was never too much or overstated -- it is there, and the audience appreciates it, but it's not overly important to the story so much as assists in building background. There's also a young boy that Kainan befriends whose cute, dirt-covered face made me smile. The acting is all very good, the special effects are tremendous, and the Moorwen is more than simply a blundering beast. One gets the impression that it is not a ""dumb animal"" but knows what it is doing, and is intentionally paying back Kainan for previous sins. In that respect, I must confess to experiencing some sadness for it, since essentially it is making a bid for survival as much as revenge. This may weaken the driving impulse of the film for some, but made it a multi-layered experience for me. The costumes and the music are also quite good, and I cannot stress enough how much I loved our introduction to Freya -- engaging in a practice swordfight with her father, while arguing about whether or not she will marry Wulfric.

Overall, I was surprised how good the movie was. It was thoroughly enjoyable with moments of adventure, humor, and just enough mushiness to satisfy both genres, but I suspect that the violence might be a bit off-putting. Excellent for fans of an unusual genre, but not for everyone.",1332892800,,3638,4.724409448818897

It is kind of a combination of 13th Warrior and Beowulf stories, and the result was actually better than 13W or any of the various Beowulf movies out there.

Why have I never heard of it before?!? The premise alone is intoxicating: vikings, alien beasts, space travel, worlds colliding with worlds colliding with worlds...!!!  I for one loved the cinematography; it was dark and rich with deep saturated color. The Viking world was painted vividly with the costumes and custom - the fight scenes were a bit gruesome for my taste, but well choreographed.  Were there historical discrepancies? sure, but it's a MOVIE. Was some of the script-writing a bit cheesie? Yep. But Jim Caviezel (however you spell it) brought his usual emotional depth to his character - think ""tortured/sensitive"" warrior-and Sophia Myles was a great foil --beautiful and tough without being super-annoying. Were there some plot holes? Yes. For example, **SPOILER** if the beasts were all killed by fire originally - why did the fire trap fail? but overall the writers/director pulled me into the world of the script and the actors kept me there, and I didn't want to leave.",1328313600,3,1139,4.927083333333333

3548415,4,B001EAWMGA,"I randomly spotted this movie on the Amazon rental lists and gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised to see a full-length film with a pretty solid production value. My only real critical complaint was with Caveziel's acting, which I found stale and completely uninspired, but the rest of the characters easily made up for it.

While the special effects are very obviously lower-budget than a lot of top Hollywood films, it never detracts from the story. There is a decent amount of humanity and emotional storyline involved, but that's not why I rented this movie. I wanted to see an alien and Outlander delivered. The alien was a fantastic creation, despite being a blend of many of the alien creature cliches we see these days (most derived from either Predator or the Alien series).

As my title states, the movie leads in with a strong, character-driven first act that introduces us to the world we're watching. The second act is primarily action-driven, with a few violent confrontations that were choreographed quite well in my opinion. But then the third act begins, and the movie pulls out every cliched, overused, and uninteresting action movie mechanic it can to drive the story forward for another 20-30 minutes. It was entirely unnecessary, as I felt the movie could have reached an excellent conclusion without the additional storyline tacked on. It also betrayed the best feature the movie had going for it, in that the glimpses we get of the alien were detailed, but short-lived, and it was perfect that way. During the conclusion of the movie, the audience basically shakes hands with the thing and congratulates it on its gripping performance, leaving nothing to the imagination and everything to the special effects.

This review primarily documents my complaints. I feel no need to document most of my compliments, as I think you should experience them yourself and watch this movie. It's not perfect, but it was a very entertaining 2 hours, and a great fusion of the classic medieval army and alien creature-feature stories.",1327276800,,2047,4.962099125364431

As a story and as entertainment, this was a wonderful 2 hours.  As a movie in all its computer-generated glory, this was incredible.  I rented it, and enjoyed it so much I purchased it.

Caviezel is from another planet, much advanced over 9th Century Norseland.  His ship crashes on Earth, killing all aboard  except Caviezel and the Beast.  He joins forces with a local tribe and sets about hunting the Beast.  Or is the Beast hunting them?  Along the way, of course, he picks up a woman who is a warrior to match his own heart and skills.

The monster is similar in so many ways with all the other outer space monsters, but with a few twists that made this monster an awesome adversary.  Caviezel is similar in so many ways with all the other heros, but with a few twists that made him more believable and more enjoyable.

Jim Caveziel's blue eyes were the star of the show, most evident in the closeups; tearing up when he gets emotional. This role is quite a departure from his one as Jesus,  in Passion of the Christ from which he was being punished by the Hollywood left in denying him really good roles. This one was filmed in Eastern Europe. This film is two hours of entertainment and is indicative of the versatility of this fine, handsome and manyly  actor.

3548428,4,B001EAWMGA,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable monster movie.  Because it is serious scif (if that isn't an oxymoron), the story was believable enough to capture my imagination.  A space voyager crashes to Earth in 709 CE, with mysterious though comprehensible technologies - he connects his brain to the computer, getting a download of the local Norse dialect and basic information about their world view and state of civilization.  A lone survivor, he is charismatic and tough, ready to take on a challenge alone, some idea of which we get from his exploration of a devastated village.  What he doesn't quite plan for is the skill and ferocity of the Vikings, one of whom captures him and brings him back to camp.

There are many vivid and very well acted characters.  The alien, it seems, has walked into a volatile situation of incessant war between rival chiefdoms.  He explains to them that he is hunting a dragon, which they find laughable until the creature attacks in the night.  This makes the alien a comrade and guide in the hunt.  He befriends a claimant to the throne, whose betrothed is a strong, not-too-enamoured woman.  The fight is brutally graphic, has a wonderfully believable adversary with many surprises in store, and moves quickly.  The atmospherics are also lushly Nordic, in a hunter-gatherer waste with inferior iron and crude implements.

This is riveting entertainment with enough subtlety that it can be viewed many times for enjoyment.  Recommended.",1321920000,,1465,5.0041322314049586

Then you'll love this movie, a made-in-Canada iron-age epic that incorporates elements of Predator and Beowulf.  Basically, Kainan, a warrior from outer space, crash lands on Earth, bringing with him an alien predator known as the Moorwen (the Moorwen killed his family on another planet and tagged along on the spaceship to kill his crew). That sounds simple, but there are layers to this, layers which I do not want to give away, which instill Kainan with regret and guilt. Anyway, now that he's crashed on Earth, Kainan helps the local vikings, led by the always excellent John Hurt, kill da monster. It's a simple story, so it basically boils down to the strength of the actors and the richness of the production.  It's a beautiful film, the monster is AWESOME. Everybody's covered in dirt unless they're the king or the king's daughter.  Gorgeous Sophia Myles saves this from being a total sausage fest. Ron Perlman, always a delight to watch, chews some scenery as a rival viking chieftan.  Karl Urban look-alike Jack Huston is a wonderful addition as the viking warrior Wulfar. There's even comic relief from Cliff Saunders, who plays brave, drunken Boromir.

  Within the first ten minutes I'd set down the needlework to give my full attention to watching the story.  Within an hour I knew I would need to own this DVD (not a common impulse for me).  Vikings - in a believable setting - and not a horned helmet in sight.  Architecture, clothing, homes, everyday items, all done with much care and it makes such a difference!  The Outlander's past history works in giving him his new fate.  A few events in the story might have been stretching things a bit, but the creature was beautifully done, the scenery was gorgeous, and the people suited their roles.

So at first I was thinking, `Wow, WAY better than most Sy-Fy channel crap movies. Almost too good to be true. What surprised me was, for a film that never saw the light of day in theaters, the cast was great, the CG was excellent (especially the CG creature...very very nice), and the special effects (blood spurting from beheaded bodies etc). Nice twist (SPOILER) that the hero was not from our planet, and had landed here in the Viking era. Soundtrack was good, and had nice build-up to the `anxiety' scenes. Downfall for this film was the script was totally `Hollywood', and you knew every line, and every scene progression before it happened. Very much an `Alien' or `Grendel' clone. STILL, I gave it 4 stars because the cast was superb (not a bunch of B actors) and I HAD to pause it when I went to the bathroom so I wouldn't miss a minute.

3548435,4,B001EAWMGA,"The 2008 film 'Outlander' is a surprisingly good action adventure film comprised of a wonderfully clever mix of futuristic sci-fi, horror and some ""good ol' boy"" Viking types in 709 AD, Norway. Though the storyline begins a little slowly, things pick up before long when the monster Grendal (extraterrestial hitch-hiker) explodes onto the screen. That's when the fun and mayhem really takes off at high speed.

There are three essentials for a film in this genre to be accepted by the audience and successful at the box office;

1- A memorable, bigger than life hero,
2- An attractive and fiercely independent woman to act as foil and love interest to the hero and
3- A monster that both frigntens and fascinates.

James Caviezel fulfills the first requirement, Sophia Myles the second and the filmmakers reimagining of the classic Norse creature Grendal certainly fits the bill for the third. Bottom line, 'Outlander' probably won't make your list of all-time favorite films, but you'll still take it off the shelf once in a while and watch it nevertheless.",1310428800,2,1058,5.0

Its race was decimated by a rapacious people who, when they found the Moorwen planet, wanted it and took it.  The story begins with the last surviving Moorwen and the soldier Kainan aboard a ship that crash lands on earth during the iron age, in ancient Norway, land of the Vikings.  The Moorwen soon rampages through Viking villages, destroying everything in sight and leaving no bodies behind.

I found the story entertaining enough but not memorable - not on a scale as, say, Alien or Predator.  The acting is good.  You can't go wrong with John Hurt and Ron Perlman - in a role that suits him to a tee - sharing the screen with young action heroes Jim Caviezel, Jack Huston and the lovely Sophia Myles.  Creature design can make or break a movie in this genre regardless of the acting, and the Moorwen definitely makes it.  It's the fiercest, most nightmarish beast on screen on any planet.

It was very crafty, how they interwove sci-fi and dragon lore from Viking history into this!  Yes, the plot is complicated, but not so much that people can't follow it; have a little faith in us, Tom Keogh.  We're not ignorant.

3548440,3,B001EAWMGA,"In OUTLANDER Jim Caviezel plays an alien hunter so utterly deadpan he makes his PASSION OF THE CHRIST role seem flighty and vivacious. Somewhen in the Viking Iron Age, an extraterrestrial named Kainan (Caviezel) crashlands his space ship, sends it hurtling into the Scandinavian drink. His crew all dead and now bereft of his hi-tech weaponry, the stranded Kainan sets out on his mission to capture the man-eating alien predator called a Moorwen. But, while tracking the monster, Kainan is captured by a group of Vikings and taken to their compound. Not too long after, something begins to make raids on the Vikings' home and territory. Prevailing theories offer a dragon and a bear, and, oboy, does that ever get these doughty Vikings all fired up. Off they go, a-huntin', with their clean-shaven captive in tow.

OUTLANDER, when broken down, is essentially PREDATOR reimagined in old Norway and peopled with medieval, bearded, grog-swilling Norsemen and an intense spaceman. Some bells and whistles are thrown in, like John Hurt as King Hrothgar, Ron Perlman as a bald-headed Viking, and Sophia Myles as the Viking princess, Freya, who knows her way around a sword and isn't shy about baring her midriff, never mind that the near freezing climate seems to dictate bundling up in layers.

Early on, Kainan's computer indicates that Earth is an abandoned seed colony, and it would've been nice if the film had touched more on that. And for someone coming from an advanced culture and superior technology, Kainan isn't allowed a lot of chances to flaunt his stuff as such. Heck, the gent from A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT exercised his futuristic expertise more. Instead, Kainan finds himself immersed into the Vikings' hardy way of life, gradually celebrated in King Hrothgar's mead hall and romancing the king's feisty daughter. However, the best relationship here is the one that develops between Kainan and his warrior rival Wulfric (Jack Huston).

OUTLANDER is better than PATHFINDER (another recent film about Vikings), but it's sort of like saying that a paper cut is better than a poke in the eye. One's marginally preferrable but, mostly, you'd still rather not have both. OUTLANDER's achievement is that it combines Vikings and space aliens and still manages to come away with a story that is predictable and tame. Character development is nil, with these stock characters simply refusing to stand out. Sorry to say, Jim Caviezel, as an action hero, comes across as bland.

Not the acting, not the plot, but there are some saving graces. I thought the CG work is well rendered on the Moorwen, and I especially liked the bioluminescent touch. The several shifts in venue - the dark woods to the mead hall to the hellish caverns - serve to infuse energy, help to fight off that sense of staidness (but it's a losing battle). And I thought that the game of balance on shields (held up by drunken Vikings) was pretty cool.

A slightly better than average 3 out of 5 stars for OUTLANDER. I recommend it mostly for the well-done sci-fi action sequences. Hopefully, the writers of the upcoming COWBOYS AND ALIENS view OUTLANDER as a cautionary tale and learn from it.",1307836800,23,3184,4.94392523364486

Well I was extremely pleased with the effects story line and ending of this movie.  NOTHING WAS OVER THE TOP and didn't try to be something it wasn't. (Didn't try to be ""epic"" and failed feeling)It didn't try to have a political message, was not some cheap cliche action movie (like Vin Diesel movies or Jason Statham) or anything like what you expect from smaller limited release movies.  It was simply a good movie, great story, and well rounded.  I like the fight scenes, the effects, the sci fi was believable and the ""dragon"" was something cool looking but yet still had that nasty ""Alien"" (Sigourney Weaver) bad ass killer effect. If your looking for a movie with action/sci fi/viking blend without having to tolerate and extreme stretching of your imagination then this is your movie. LOL

I stress that I hate over the top Sci-Fi and action if the guy is leaping 30 yards and shooting rockets from his wallet, I would not even bother writing a review.

3548457,4,B001EAWMGA,"One thing that can be disappointing about B-movies/ Alternative movies is their lack of budget. Not so with this film as its makers apparently spent $47 million - the type of figure that Kevin Smith would have killed for with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clerks/dp/B002LMOCJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clerks</a>&nbsp;- only for the distributor to drop the film leading to US box office takings of just $60,000.

Bad news for the Producers, but good news for alternative movie fans as this is now a movie with a B-movie plot but an A-movie budget!

Watching the film it is a little hard to work out how such a film got such financing. In content, it is similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-13th-Warrior/dp/B002CLBJVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 13th Warrior</a>&nbsp;in being a good movie with good acting, dialogue, etc but with a plot set in an obscure location that would be unlikely to make it a box-office smash (Norway, anyone?)

But if you're tired of watching the identikit action movies produced by Hollywood, then this is at least refreshingly different. The main character is a space traveller who is marooned on planet Earth in 7th Century Norway. Rather like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, he's brought something rather unpleasant with him in the form of a 'Moorwen' which proceeds to kill the local population.

Starring Jim Caviezel & John Hurt, the acting is convincing & seamless. Although the plot is a little predictable (despite its unusual setting), it does still keep your attention & provide the odd surprise.

So, if you've come across this film in a quest to find something new to watch then it provides something a little different to either trashy B-movies or slick A-movies, falling somewhere between the two. Maybe not the greatest film in the World, it is still worth a watch when the missus is away...",1298419200,,2037,5.8915254237288135

A bit predictable in lots of places, and a bit cheesy in others.  Some uneven handling of plot events; not sure if this was an editing problem or a script problem, but these situations could have been improved with a very few scenes / exchanges.

However, as an sci-fi / monster action flick, more than acceptable overall.  Reasonably enjoyable with a couple of wince moments.  Some portions are done quite well.  The backstory for the monster is decent enough.  Effects are good.  Chances for a sequel are not promising...

The producer/director did not pick Jim Caviezel to play the lead by accident.  The key to the story is the conflicted inner wounds carried by Caviezel.  He is torn by guilt, driven by hatred.  Only an actor of Caviezel's caliber and range could convincingly portray a man racked by opposing emotional drives and exhibit the depth of his inner suffering.  This is primarily an action film, yes, but it delves into issues of culpability, self-advancement, the stultifying horror of personal loss, the ignominity of causing incalculable suffering to others, the drive for redemption and self-renewal.  This is what the story is really about, and I found it admirable that the creators reached well-beyond the stereotypical sci-fi monster/horror story to give the audience a lot of material to contemplate.

3548466,4,B001EAWMGA,"Outlander is technically about an alien warrior who happens to land on Earth, bringing with him a beast called a moorwen.  This would be a standard alien-out-of-water-hunts-monster plot, but Outlander has a few tricks up its sleeve.  For one, the film takes place in 709 AD at the height of the Viking Age. For another, the moorwen is an innovative beast; part feline predator, part bioluminescent angler fish. And the moorwen isn't alone--it travels with an equally violent cub.

This combination of factors makes for a highly entertaining, if rather single-minded, monster movie.  The arrival of outlander Kainan (James Caviezel) and the moorwen that crashed his ship tips the delicate balance of power between Viking King Rothgar (John Hurt) and Rus leader Gunnar (Ron Perlman). Each side blames the other for the devastation wrought by the moorwen, and nobody believes poor Kainan's tale of a ""dragon"" that destroyed his ""ship."" There's a subplot between mopey heir-apparent Wulfric (Jack Huston) and hottie warrior princess Freya (Sophia Myles) but they have so little chemistry that the audience already knows who the fiery redhead will end up with.

The real star is the moorwen. It is a fully realized CGI creation.  The lighting effects are breathtaking as the moorwen's bioluminescence changes to match its mood. It uses these glowing lures to draw Vikings into its clutches and as a weapon to blind its enemies. Mundane weapons are useless against such a foe.

Fortunately there's Kainan, who arrives to teach the Vikings how to trap the creature.  Then it's a journey into the moorwen's lair to finish its offspring.  If this combination of Vikings, outsiders, monsters and mommies sounds familiar it's because Outlander is a Beowulf retelling with sci-fi trappings.

Outlander focuses a bit too much on Kainan's past, a past that's bog-standard sci-fi: greedy-colonist-finds-redemption-on-backwater-planet. Freya, who demonstrates her proficiency with a sword early in the movie, spends most of her time in a really poor wardrobe choice as a damsel-in-distress. And Kainan's alien culture remains oddly ill-defined.  But all that is excusable in light of the amazing special effects, cool alien monsters, and Vikings fighting alien monsters.

If you can shelve your expectations and knowledge of Viking history for a few hours, Outlander will not disappoint.",1293580800,3,2371,5.327077747989276

All I have to say is if you are a fan of historical backdrop movies mixed in with epic drama, love and action that contrast past and future by making them ""clash as titans"" (no not like that other dumb movie but rather metaphorically speaking in contrasting human values, mind and soul), then you will definitely enjoy this movie!!

3548471,4,B001EAWMGA,"Though I wanted to see this film when it came out theatrically in the spring of 2009, I expected very little from it.  It was just the concept that seemed cool - vikings and monsters and aliens, awesome!  But the movie came and went - I saw posters and a trailer for it, but I'm not sure if it played where I live at all, if it did it was only here for a week.  And it got generally poor reviews; I know a lot of people here aren't fans of professional reviewers, but I've followed film criticism for a long time - since well before the rise of amateur critics here on Amazon and other places - and I'm fairly critical myself, especially when it comes to contemporary action movies.  I love action as much as the next guy, but to me it's been going downhill pretty steadily as the budgets have gone sky-high and CGI has taken over for pure brawny manly fighting and gunplay.  So I really didn't figure this would be much of anything by the time I got around to it last night.

Well, what a pleasant surprise!  No, it's no CITIZEN KANE or anything, heck it isn't even DIE HARD and I'm not sure it's a patch on the old Kirk Douglas THE VIKINGS or some of the better 50s monster movies - but it's a heckuva lot of fun, it's got no obvious huge flaws, and most importantly it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  It's a good sign to me when, right away, the film bothers to explain (but not in overbearing detail) how it's hero Kainan (James Cavaziel) is human despite crashing in a spaceship in 700s Scandinavia, and how he can learn the native language (Old Norse).  I like how he's held when captured as a likely enemy, as he should be - but the king, Rothgar (John Hurt) is wise enough to listen to him and quick to free him when he's shown his usefulness in killing a huge bear that threatened the king and several men.  At this point Kainan essentially becomes a Viking - but it's clear that he's got his own purpose, because there's a monster much tougher than any bear on the loose, a ""dragon"" called a Morwen, that followed him from another world.

The story is basic, and reasonably predictable - we've got a rival, would-be king Wulfric (the too-handsome Jack Huston), a potential love interest and Wulfric's intended, Freya (Sophia Myles), and rival chief Gunnar (Ron Perlman) who blames Rothgar for his village's destruction.  How all the alliances and relationships shake out isn't going to surprise anyone, but it all feels pretty natural - the developing feelings between Freya and Kainan don't ever come off as either forced or cute, and Wulfric's rivalry isn't there just to have a big climactic duel that's going to jeopardize the ultimate mission - destroying the Morwen.  And Kainan's eventual choice is left up right until the end, and seems like it could go either way.  I did think that the flashback sequences detailing the origin of the Morwen and Kainan's people were unnecessary, and getting into the morality of the destruction of the dragonlike creatures probably was unneeded also; we never get to know them as anything but highly destructive and bloodthirsty animals, so I'm not sure what purpose is served in showing Kainan feel guilty about his hand in their annihilation.  These bits and a few others do help push the film to near two hours, not really that long by today's action movie standards, but a bit more than it needs to be, as otherwise it's a pretty lean and fast-moving piece of work.

The cast is all fine; Perlman of course dominates in his unfortunately-few scenes, and Cavaziel acquits himself well - a bit stoic and dull, but that's not a bad thing in this kind of film.  The CGI monster looks OK, and I like that we only see it bit by bit until the second half of the film - I think director/cowriter Howard McCain learned some things about monster movies from older masters like Roger Corman.  A nice-looking Viking village, and great scenery throughout (Nova Scotia stands in for Norway here).  Some of the action sequences are a bit too dark and frenetic for my taste - a bit too much of the modern fast-cutting style where it's hard to know what's going on - but this isn't as overdone as it is in a lot of films, and there's a good understanding of building suspense and putting a longer action sequence together, particularly at the climax.  Overall this is one of the better action/monster films to come along since the first two ALIEN films, and it's sad that it got so little exposure initially.  Well, let's hope it builds an audience.",1291334400,6,4502,4.526510480887793

Essentially a light sci-fi take on the Beowulf myth, ""Outlander"" ultimately turns out to be another ""hero versus monster"" movie.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; many movies have become classics, and build entire franchises around this core concept.  But in and of itself, this makes the movie not terribly original.  The most original aspect is that the hero is a space-traveler who crash lands with a vengeful alien creature in Bronze Age Norway, and that the monster isn't just another mindless killing machine, but it as a bit of an agenda.  The hero, Caviezel's character, must then set about finding a way to work with the local villagers to stop the monster, the Moorwin, before it completes its vengeance.

For a seemingly outlandish (no pun intended) concept mixed up in a cliche'd genre, the movie actually plays better than expected.  The subtle character development of the hero is done fairly well, enough so that you at least come to see him as more than a standard tough guy, monster killer.  And the surprising twist concerning the monster's origins make you nearly sympathize with the creature's motivations (but not quite; it's still violently butchering everyone and has no spoken lines, so for all intents and purposes, it's still just a monster).  In addition, cinematography, musical scores, and special effects are surprisingly well done for a movie of this caliber.  And yes, as another reviewer points out, the monster is surprisingly original in design and concept.

However, this movie suffers from several glaring logic problems (most notably, HOW DOES A SPACE FARING HUMAN LAND IN BRONZE AGE NORWAY???; is there some time travel stuff they forgot to mention?  Oh, and steel doesn't cut the monster, so they take the advance metal from the hero's space ship and are able to reforge it using a simple fire??).  And the ending to the movie is more than a little contrived, enough so that you might roll your eyes and scratch your head at the same time.  Further, while they try and give the Moorwin monster a back story and reason to not completely hate it, this effort ultimately fails, and you still end up seeing it as a mindless killing machine that needs to be put down like some feral dog.  And the course of the movie is still fairly predictable and not terribly unforeseen.  Finally, this movie starts out looking like a sci-fi, but if you're expecting anything resembling the standard lasers and aliens and space-ships and cool planets fare, don't bother; after about the first 30 minutes, this is mostly an ancient-style monster tale.  Nothing really sci-fi about this movie.

So, in summary:

Pros:
--- Good special effects
--- Fairly original story concept
--- Original monster design and concept
--- Decent character development (especially for a movie of this type)
--- Decent pacing, scoring, and action

Cons:
--- Multiple glaring logic problems, starting out at the very beginning
--- Not a terribly original or unsurprising ending or event development
--- Some story and character development is mostly weak and wasted
--- Movie appears to be a sci-fi, but ends up just being another ancient monster movie

I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, by any means, but I definitely wouldn't buy it, and I probably won't ever be watching it again.

Yet through those faults and one less-than-satisfactory flashback regarding Outlander's past, this movie is amusing, creative, original, and worth watching. The less you know about the movie, the better the movie will be.",1283904000,,511,5.2439024390243905
3548481,3,B001EAWMGA,"A spaceship crashes into the lake of the 8th century Norway, and the only surviving traveler Kainan (James Caviezel) is captured by the Viking warriors. Kainan, or the ""Outlander,"" explains to their wise king Rothgar (John Hurt) that the recent massacre of the nearby village is actually caused by the ""dragon,"" or a predatory creature Moorwen, that he accidentally brought with him to their land.

""Outlander"" blends the genres of science fiction and Scandinavian epic poem. The heroic story of Beowulf, the warrior fighting Grendel, is given a twist. Its ""dragon"" is not just a fearsome monster to be killed; it is an extraterrestrial life form with a surprisingly complex background. Also, the story has a heroine, a brave and strong one. Sophia Myles is Freya, king's sword-wielding daughter and romantic interest for Kainan.

""Outlander"" is based on an interesting idea about the origin of the dragon legends, but battle scenes are just acceptable, and as action adventure the storyline is largely a standard one. The film departs from the formula in explaining the back story of Kainan and Moorwen, but the film moves on before it really gets interesting.

The screenplay has one or two too many subplots: Kainan's rivalry / friendship with Wulfric (Jack Huston), a warrior who is supposed to be heir to the king; an orphan boy named Eric; romance with Freya and the furious rival king Gunnar (Ron Perlman), who thinks that Rothgar is responsible for the deaths of his clan. None of them is fully explored, and Ron Perlman's character is sadly wasted.

Probably the most unique aspect of ""Outlander"" is Patrick Tatopoulos-designed creature Moorwen and its suggested history. Kainan and Moorwen (and later two Viking kings) share certain tragic back story. But to visualize the story of this scale, the film needs more budget. I know I shouldn't be asking too much, and the set of the Viking village and their costumes are very good, but the creature and the fight scenes need better effects.

""Outlander"" starts out as a unique mixture of genres, but cannot sustain its unique nature very long.",1283472000,,2100,5.005730659025788

3548486,4,B001EAWMGA,"Roger Ebert gave this movie two stars, but he obviously wasn't paying attention from the get-go.  For example, he indicates that it's scientifically ""unlikely from a Darwinian point of view that two human species should evolve independently  and contemporaneously on separate worlds.  Even more so that they would share common sexual feelings and be able to mate. . . .""  After the main character, Kainan (played by Jim Caviezel), crashes on earth at the beginning of the movie, he asks his portable computer where he is.  It responds with ""Abandoned seed colony.""  So, obviously, Kainan and the people of earth have the same origin, i.e. Kainan's people got earth going a while back, abandoned the project and no one on earth knows about it.  It's called panspermia.

All that being said, the film is an interesting take on the Beowulf legend that explains how such a creature could have suddenly ""popped up"" in Viking culture.  In the movie, the Grendel analog is known as the Moorwen, but it's much quicker and more powerful than anything in the Beowulf poem, making its eradication more of a group effort.

All the actors do a fine job in this one, from Caviezel to John Hurt to Ron Perlman to Jack Huston.  While this won't win any awards for cinematic depth, the movie is fun, well-made and should be enjoyed by most any fan of Viking culture and/or sci-fi horror.",1279065600,3,1370,4.762711864406779

I am a dedicated science fiction fan and have been one for a long time; although there are some occasional references to science fiction I would classify this movie as much more like fantasy-horror. This in itself is not necessarily bad; it's just not real science fiction.

The movie starts with the scene of a space craft crashing into Earth during the age of the Vikings; from that point on it pretty much becomes a fantasy-horror film with lots of slashing and guts replete with a terrible monster that starts wreaking havoc on the local Viking communities.

It just so happens I'm not a fantasy-horror film fan so I was disappointed to see how the film was developing; if you are a fan of this type of movie you may enjoy it. I had watched the film expecting a little more science fiction than what was delivered.

3548491,4,B001EAWMGA,"I bought this, and another DVD (Underworld 3) on a whim, based on reviews and descriptions. Comparing these two, Outlander definitely wins out. It was good action and nice CGI, not too mushy, and good, solid characters within the narrow range that is usually allotted to your friendly neighbourhood action characters.

The main topic, a spaceman crash landing in the viking era, is in itself very promising. I also found I liked the way they explained it in the bonus disk, about how this could actually be the event on which Beowulf. There are zillions of ways of looking at old myths and epics, and why should this explanation be less plausible than some others?

The plotline was somewhat predictable, if you are familiar with the rote action movies - ""tortured"" hero who has a killed wife and child in his past, a local woman, or better even, a local WARRIOR (read: Mary Sue) woman, an old and wise man, a hothead heroic sidekick-character, and a demonic menace. I guess you can already guess what happens to each of them? You probably guess correctly. No real surprises there.

A BIG mistake was IMHO naming a character Boromir. Egads. If they felt the need to use a Tolkienish name, why not take one from Rohan, where they really had Germanic names which would have suited perfectly? Why an Elvish-based name which stood really out like a pink polka-dotted elephant?

And as regards the bonus disk: oddly, while I liked to see all that additional material, making of and deleted scenes, I found the fact that they even bothered filling a whole disk with bonuses way too pretentious. This is no big hit movie to require such self-aggrandisement.

Okay, so I've written a lot about how this was not a good movie - but it wasn't all that bad, really. Mostly, I liked it. It was nice entertainment, and someday I'll probably put it into my DVD player again. :) If you're not looking for anything serious, this might just suit your taste.",1277510400,,1939,4.674486803519062

Having selected ""view it now"", the player blocked us from downloading the movie and so we had no solution to the problem.

We also once bought a movie from amazon. I thought i was buying a copy of the movie for the kids to watch in the car.  But nothing could have been further from the truth.  You cannot burn it to dvd and you cannot watch it without an internet connection.

In my opinion, the paranoid approach to protecting the material produces a service that is utterly unuseable, and frustrating in its stupidity.

I think it is more practical to go to a blockbuster or a walmart and buy or rent the dvd.  you will have a better viewing experience, you can watch it whenever you want on whatever device you want, and without having to having to get permission from amazon to watch the movie you theoretically already paid to own or rent.

3548495,3,B001EAWMGA,"This manly medieval sci-fi and swords thriller hits most of the cliches you'd expect but manages still to feel fairly fresh.

An alien astronaut - who looks just like James Caviezel - crash lands on a strange planet, that turns out to be medieval Norway, on Earth.  Luckily he has a gadget that can teach him the local Norse dialect in moments (and luckily for us the local dialect sounds just like English).  Unluckily for lots of the locals, he's also unwittingly brought something with him on his ship, a predatory monster who quickly decimates a local village.  As an outlander with strange clothing, the alien guy is immediately suspect in the plunder, and nearby warriors capture and torture him for answers.  Before long, though, you just know he'll be hitting it big with the local beauty, and leading the Vikings on their quest to destroy the beast.

It's entertaining enough, though the characters are straight out of nearly every film of this kind you've ever seen.  The wise king, the ambitious warrior who wants to live up to his own dead father's legacy, the warrior princess, lots of grunting fighters, the drunken comic relief, the romance that begins with a slap.  Still, they deliver their lines well, and in spite of lines like ""may Odin's blessings be upon you,"" John Hurt plays a convincing king, Caviezel plays a plausible space warrior pilgrim, and Ron Perlman steals every spare moment he's in as a raging rival warlord.

I like the idea of the movie, space traveler from some other world meets humans from our past, but the plot was rushed and unconvincing. The guy on the horse was able to sneak up on Caviezel in the woods and knock the weapon out of his hands without him getting a shot off?!?! That was strike one.. Then they capture him and think he's the one who wiped out a whole village all by himself and he's the bad guy because the leader of that village will think they will be blamed. But just a short time later he's suddenly the hero wrapped in skins walking through the big doors to the feast and the french horns are playing hero music and they do the ""shields"" thing running around on top of shields?!? That was strike two, three, and four, but I STILL wanted this thing to work! So I watched the rest of the movie with my fingers crossed...

3548517,4,B001EAWMGA,"This film shows yet again how much mileage there is in the old stories. Beowulf is a poem from the Anglo-Saxon oral bardic tradition, written down by someone who had read Vergil's Aeneid, and who gives a Christian overlay to a pagan legend - the monster Grendel is called by the scribe a ""son of Cain"". In the film, the hero (who has inadvertently brought the monster to Earth, along with his load of guilt) is named Kainan.
So how does this film compare with other films that draw on the Beowulf story? Sturla Gunnarsson, in Beowulf & Grendel, makes the monster an almost human troll, so he can dispense with CGI and focus more on the psychological than the physical conflicts. Much of this film's pleasure comes from following the hero's attempts to find out the truth in a confusing situation. John McTiernan's The 13th Warrior, based on Michael Crichton's novel, combines elements of the Beowulf story with other folklore and invention, and hooks the audience by giving it the point of view of the reluctant hero - a sophisticated man banished for his indiscretions from the refined Arab culture of the time. Like Outlander, it shows believable Vikings rather than Hollywood stereotypes. All three films benefit from using live human actors, unlike the recent atrocity where the actors contributed only their voices and their gestures in motion suits to the CGI.
If you want tortured and intricate characterization rather than believable conflict and action, you can always go back to Ingmar Bergman. But for a very entertaining and well done new version of an ancient story, this film would be hard to top.",1262563200,,1611,4.861818181818182

The CGI is pretty good. The monster looks real -most of the time. I love, love, love the ending. I also thought Sophia Myles (Moonlight/Underworld) was fantastic. She plays such a strong but vulnerable woman and you just love her. The movie has all the usual suspects, the love interest, orphaned child, wise king, warrior camaraderie, a special sword, etc but that is what makes it good. I don't mind some predictability. I had rented the movie initially and I am now buying it so I can watch it many times. And I must say Jack Huston is going to have an amazing career. You'll see him next in the 3rd Twilight movie, Eclipse, as Rosalie's doomed finance.",1260230400,4,1134,4.509708737864078
3548520,3,B001EAWMGA,"The dumbing down of film making continues. There's just too much about this film that's predictable. The novel effort aside there's nothing to recommend on this variation of yet another Grendel tale. Yes the beast is kind of cool. I'll also pretty much watch anything with Ron Perlman but those factors aside there's no bravery or innovation here. I applaud the casting director and the director for not using pumped up actors to play the Vikings (there's nothing worse than Vikings with bodies by Gold's Gym). My problem stems from the main story, the poor settings, dialog and the lead by James Caviezel which is just not riveting. He's not a bad actor but he's not given enough to pull this off. The dialog is not memorable and while some of the action is nice it requires the whole film to work with it.
The back story was the best part about the film's story line and I noticed a few people actually faulting it. That's too bad. While I'm not a fan of the basic premise (I was much more excited before it became apparent that Beowolf was being channeled AGAIN...)of the main story I did enjoy this added point about the repercussions of the arrogance and the price sometimes paid as a result of that arrogance. It wasn't PC. It was karma.
Is this a bad film. No, not really. But it could have been better had the director just been more daring with his lead casting and overall execution. The finale had a lot of potential that just fizzled for me.

3548524,3,B001EAWMGA,"An epic mythological chopper saga but with a plausible science fiction theme. It was the SF aspect which appealed to me most; the gore, of which there is plenty, not so much. I'd have given four stars for less blood. Caviezel is at his enigmatic best. Sophia Myles is a treat, both visually and as a powerful female character. She plays the fiery daughter (Freya) of the Viking chief (ably portrayed by John Hurt) and she has any man she comes across reeling, literally. Rival chief Gunnar, played by Ron Perlman is truly terrifying in hammer-wielding battle mode and only slightly less fierce than the monster itself!

The monster is all the better and more impressive, mysterious and scary for being only glimpsed and not fully seen until well into the film. This means that it benefits from the point of view that things scary are scariest when not seen, only imagined, and from being pretty fearful when it does finally appear. Possibly making reference to the `Alien' films, in one scene a monster drips saliva from glassy fangs onto Freya's cheek. Which brings me to special effects, here used in exactly the right proportion to generate the suspense and excitement required at the right moments, without being over-used or obtrusive.
More of what keeps the film moving, apart from the action, is the use of an inspiring sequence of locations: low earth orbit, desert planet landscapes, underwater, underground, and mist-shrouded forest with sunlight shafts stabbing through in anticipation of what is to follow. The SF special effects are excellent also and do a fine job of depicting an advanced civilization making a terrible error.

Plot treats include: wily norseman captures well-armed starman, using his horse; the boy with the bread; and of course, `shields'.

The film is well-paced and the entire narrative 'lavishly envisioned'. The costumes and weaponry are spot on for creating atmosphere.

Finally, the bonus features are excellent, especially the deleted scenes. Although I can understand why some of the scenes were cut to maintain the momentum, they are particularly worth watching because they add humanity and soul to the story.

This is the sort of film that gives Science Fiction Action movies a good name. Why do I like it so much? Let me count the ways.

The Viking society of the period looks authentic. I'm not saying that it is authentic, but it certainly looks it.

There's a good rationale for the alien looking like a human being. That's because he is human. There's a good reason why he's crash-landed on Earth and why he's hunting the monster. Also why he's quite morose for much of the film. But tough, this is an action movie and our hero can kick bottom with the best of them. The monster is a terrific creation slightly resembling Marveldog the man-eating monster from Alan Moore's Miracleman series. If you've seen the trailers you might think it's a dragon breathing fire but it isn't. It uses an intense bio-luminescence which looks great and is a good idea to boot.

Great cast. Jim Caviezel makes a good hero and is well-supported by British actress Sophia Myles as King John Hurt's sassy daughter, Jack Houston as the man who would be the next king and marry the ex-king's daughter -you can see the tension already- Ron Pearlman doing gruff, tough and aggressive, and a plethora of character actors with a variety of accents, most of whom get eaten, minced, maimed, and deaded in a variety of ways.

The monster is used sparingly and some time is spent with Viking/hero interactions which some people see as a flaw but I enjoyed. The action sequences are convincing as are the excellent special effects. I've a teensy problem with the satisfying but predictable end but that's really the worst I can say.

So, not the greatest movie ever made, hence the 4 star rating, but one hell of a good time. Loved it. Going to watch it again soon. Buy it. Now. Stop reading, go and buy it. Okay, I'm finished.",1256083200,7,1996,4.515235457063712

Anyway...after checking out the cast and storyline I rented it as quickly as I could. Many of the user reviews vary from mediocre to tremendous. I guess I fall into the former category.

This is certainly a ""high concept"" movie with a really nifty premise. (I won't reiterate the plot as others have already done so) The cast is good. The production values are high but it just misses the mark and that seems to happen mostly at the script level. For instance: The Sophia Myles character goes from a strong dislike of Caviezel's Kainin to a loving admiration way too quickly. A better script would have given the transformation more time and given the audience less of a jolt. The Wulfric ""king to be"" character is also poorly painted. We're ""told"" he is more than a bit of an oafish brute, but we aren't shown it, so his transformation to a really decent guy as the film progresses doesn't really satisfy.

The CGI effects are uneven. At times the dragon looks really cool and at other times it just doesn't cut it. The direction could have used a bit more pizzazz as well. In concept this movie is up there with 300 or Mutant Chronicles but it lacks the visual appeal of those films. It isn't bad by any means, It just falls short.

Whatever that intangible goodie is that makes a great  movie sit in the back of your mind so that when you wake up the next morning your first thought is about the movie you saw the night before... that is ""the stuff"".  Whatever it is that makes you point it out to a total stranger (who isn't even looking at movies) when you pass by it at the store... that is ""the stuff"".

A short list of things that made this movie nifty:

1. A phreaking cool antagonist with biological qualities that add to the already well done atmospheric properties of the movie... and it fit in fantasy AND sci-fi settings with equal ease.  Best beast in years.

2. Well done atmosphere that makes the viewer pay attention to the bushes and shadowed corners while you watch the rest of the movie.

3. A nice, mysterious progression of the back-story for the protagonist AND antagonist as well as the supporting fodder.

4. A band of warriors that develop camaraderie as the story develops

5. Viking fantasy soldiers in cool armour

6. Sci-fi Space soldiers in cool armour

Detractors were few and the first might actually be something that made the movie good:

 1. Caviezel  carried an impression of a beaten soul.  His character did have a back-story that lent itself to this type of behavior, but I never got the feeling that he totally recovered from it nor that he was fully triumphant in his conquests.  It gave the movie a bit of a ""downer"" tinge... or maybe it was a realistic nod toward the patriarch/provider/protector who keeps putting one foot in front of the other despite the soul-numbing hardships that are thrown in the way and who, through simple diligence anchored in duty and perseverance rooted in honor, manages to overcome and move on.  That didn't ruin it but it did keep it from being a ""feel good stick it to the baddy"" fantasy movie... which might actually be a good thing as some pretty horrific crap went down across the entire timeline and the way he portrayed his character forces the viewer to deal with that fact.

2. Caviezel apparently can't hold or aim a firearm properly and looked like a goofball when he had one.  Good thing he had a sword for most of the movie (I can only assume he was holding that properly).

3. There were several very minor inconsistencies that didn't ruin the movie but DID interrupt the flow and served to snap me out of the experience very briefly a few times while I struggled to suspend reality a bit too far.  These could have been handled by either more careful editing or some minor reshooting of scenes or additions to some scenes.  I'd imagine they didn't get done for the same reason this movie had a ghost presence on the primary market: MONEY.

(2 and 3 just above are the reasons why this movie is not getting a full 5 Stars from me)

Anyway, when I picked this movie up (after searching for it for 3 months after I saw its banner on a website) I was hoping for more sci-fi and less fantasy but they gave me enough to get me hooked and the story carried me through the fantasy portion.
All in all, a great, well developed movie that should have had more time in theaters and didn't get its fair share of advertising.  Go see it.  If you can't find it to rent it, it is worth buying (that is what I finally had to do).",1252972800,,3344,4.430441898527005

3548544,4,B001EAWMGA,"Vikings vs. Aliens. What's not to love?

A few years back, I read a very favorable review on Aintitcool News of a movie called ""Reign of Fire,"" a tale of post-apocalyptic Brits vs. the dragons which had decimated the Earth, with some help by a motley platoon of bad-ass Yanks (led by an altogether unrecognizably buff Matthew McConaughey).

I know; right?

And yet, it muscled its way incongruously onto the short list of the most effective, tightly-crafted monster movies I'd seen in a long time. From the mostly quite deft pacing, A-list production values, and (at times simply jaw-dropping) visual effects, to the surprisingly well-executed character work, ""Reign"" did things with a pretty absurd premise which led me to markedly expand the parameters of what I was willing to buy as raw material for a well-told story.

Which is why, when I read rather a glowing review of ""Outlander"" on AICN (here:[...]), I did not immediately click back to my newsfeed. This is not a choice I regret, having just watched it.

Is it as good as ""Reign of Fire?"" Hell, no. Does it deliver the crap sandwich you'd expect from the headline (interstellar traveler crash lands in 8th century Norway, inadvertently delivering a terrifying extraterrestrial beastie into the territory of a Viking king, with whom he must join forces to vanquish the creature that had killed his family on a distant colony world)? Oddly, no.

Part of the credit goes to the casting, with a gravelly John Hurt as the King Rothgar (no, not ""Hrothgar"" but the ref was not lost) delivering a much-needed gravitas to the fur-sporting Vikings (among whom there was a welcome absence of horned helms), to John Caviezel as the stranded star man, Kainan, and the ever-spunky and appealing Sophia Myles as the king's daughter, the cast plays it straight. This is a good thing, since with a story like this, even the slightest wink would take one dangerously into ""SyFy"" territory.

Caviezel's Kainan is a haunted, traumatized warrior with a stain on his conscience, and a major score to settle, but he is fundamentally a good man, whose frustration with the barbarians among whom he has landed is balanced by the debt he owes for the calamity he has inadvertently brought down on their heads. The process by which he wends his way into their reluctant good graces unfolds with a surprisingly satisfying exhibition of quiet virtue and bluster-free valor. Some will find his performance flat and monotonous, but I found subtleties which quite compensate for the lack of scenery-chewing machismo (the Vikings shoulder that burden with a delightfully over-the-top mannish elan).

Jack Huston plays Wulfric, the impetuous heir of Rothgar's kingdom with a nice blend of obnoxious testosterone and a promise of unpolished wisdom whose development through the course of the story is surprisingly effective, given how badly you want to brain him with a battle axe at the beginning of the story. His clumsy courtship of Myles' Freya and his bull-headed hostility toward Kainan form the concrete expressions of Rothgar's otherwise generic-sounding reservations about his readiness to claim the throne. We can actually see where he falls short in the role of a true leader, and we get to watch him confront those shortcomings, learn just the right amount of humility, and grow both as a character and as a king-in-waiting. It's a good turn for Huston, somewhat reminiscent of Karl Urban's Eomer in ""The Lord of the Rings."" He's one to watch, as he brings an appealing humanity to a role which was seemingly made for a cardboard cut-out treatment.

And then there's the creature, a coal-black, vaguely reptilian monster known as a ""Moorwen."" It's an all-CG creation which still manages to convey terrifyingly realistic presence and menace. The physics engine used in the rendering of the creature was expertly deployed; the beast never violated the rules of its motion and mass, moving with impressive speed and grace, but still conveying a daunting sense of weight and power. It phosphoresces with eerie beauty in the night, before striking with its long, whip-like tail, slicing through Vikings like a hot knife through butter. Best of all, as we learn more about its back-story, even the creature takes on a distinctly sympathetic dimensionality, without ever losing its brutality (and, again, the ""Beowulf"" reference is in evidence, as there are clear but non-slavish affinities with Grendel). The SFX team struck just the right balance between preserving the mystery of the thing's appearance, and refraining from annoyingly coy concealment.

Yes, it drags a bit in the third act. Yes, some of the ""comic relief"" was a bit broad. No there was not nearly enough of the great Ron Perlman as a rival tribesman. Yes, Kainan's Honorary Viking Costume was laughably silly.

But c'mon, it's Vikings vs. aliens. What're you expecting, King Lear?

UPDATE: Here on AICN ([...]) are some neat making-of featurettes which do not appear on the US DVD, but are planned for inclusion on the upcoming UK Blu-Ray release (there is at this time no planned US Blu-Ray release for this film...and what's up with that?!).

Now, the exec who decided against the original general release, please stand up... so that we can slap you silly!)

A very human looking space traveler Kainan (Jim Caviezel) crash lands his ship on a planet called Earth. The local time is 709 A.D. and the land belongs to Viking Tribes at war with one another. Certain that the Vikings would not comprehend the true nature of his origins, the Outlander hides the remains of his space ship, but not before he realizes he has brought with him a dangerous stow away, a hungry predator that is now picking the locals one by one. As he attempts to track the creature, Kainan is captured by a band of locals and brought to their King. What is Kainan's connection to the creature? Can the Outlander and the weary-of-a-stranger Tribe overcome their mutual mistrust and unite in order to survive? Can Kainan ever find his way home? Will he want to?

Outlander is likely the best sci-fi movie you never heard of... WHY would a studio spend $47 million to make a very good product... only to refuse to promote it?! I hunted down a used copy at my local Blockbusters and was shocked by how entertaining and well told the unusual story was, especially when compared to the rest of the so very ho-hum sci-fi fare of 2009... Damsel in distress, wise king, Vikings, alien space ships, and an alien monster who refuses to go vegetarian... Outlander manages to make sense of it all! Well, almost. There are some minor plot holes (how come Vikings can melt alien super metal in their wood burning ovens?), but it's nothing a little suspension of disbelief cannot deal with. Add good casting (I am not a fan of Jim Caviezel, but I thought his performance as a soldier haunted by guilt and a tragic past was convincing and charismatic) and well executed CGI, and the film becomes a must for any sci-fi/action/adult-fairy-tale fan.",1251849600,3,2031,4.623268698060942

The special effects actually didn't make me laugh at all, which can't be said for many SciFi movies being released recently. The back story when viewed is actually good and leaves us feeling some sympathy for the beast. The Vikings are believable and the costumes, sets, and weapons go a long way in bringing us into that realm. Well worth at least a rental.

Are there typical movie cliches here? Yes Is the acting cheesy? While the acting is not award winning it is beleivable. You are still able to connect to the characters and therefore you can feel the story instead of just watch it.

Why does everyone want more Ron Pearlman? His character was just a very basic support character and there would be no reason to have more of him. Honestly I think he should be commended. Ever since he was in Blade and thanks to Hellboy his fame has shot way up. For him to work as just a small supporting character earns him high marks in my book.

I also thought that they successfully merged the futuristic elements with the Iron Age culture very well.

It could of been a black-level adjustment issue as well, but there's no easy way to adjust that for the Amazon player without a test pattern.

After leaving a homing beacon for a rescue ship, the human must catch the Morwen before it kills lots of people.

Now what is interesting about all this is that it is set in the dark ages in Norway, around 700 AD or so.  So our hero is dealing with Vikings.  I just thought that was a really exciting idea.

How did it play out?  Well, it has two things going for it that made it pretty good:  1) The story made sense (and we all know that many don't), with an understandable story trajectory; 2) (and this is the reason I gave it a 5 star rating) it has an amazingly good cast.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job.  It reminds me of the old British horror films where the actors might have done Shakespeare one month as a job, and then a Hammer Film for their next job.  Just fine talent in any setting.  When we noticed Ron Perlman playing a sort of berzerker Viking, we just squealed with glee.

  The special effects are great for a direct to dvd movie.  From the blood and gore to the space fighting to the beast the main character has to hunt down, all done wonderfully.
  No matter how fantastic the special effects in a movie I can only enjoy a film if I get a good story as well.  The premise of the movie is good if not original, the whole vikings+something random, seem to be the new type of genre.  The plot moves pretty fluidly but is a little predictable. The acting is very well done and I for one can't say one bad thing about it.
  If I have one gripe about Outlander its something that recent Sci Fi movies seem to be doing recently. And that is trying to sympathize or humanize the alien villain.  Especially in this movie where the alien is some sort of ultimate killing machine I can't understand why they would do that.  Ultimately, intentional or not, it makes me hate the main character a little despite of he goes through.  They really need to cut that stuff out! Just let the monsters be monster please!

The acting, scenery and special effects are pretty good. The main Amazon review says the plot is complex and pulls the viewer in many directions, I didn't feel that way after viewing it. The only thing not touched upon in depth was a prior event involving an ambush & the tribe's war with some type of raiders but that wasn't really relevant to the present day plot.

It's always nice to find a cool movie that we haven't seen a million trailers for! How fun is it to have a few friends over, pop this in & have them amazed that they never even heard of it.

In fact, there are some scenes (particularly, in the main character's flashback) where the setting is very innovative and outright amazing looking. And I must say that the whole concept of this movie is cool. A space traveler (the Outlander) crash lands in Norway in 700AD, brings a monster with it, encounters Vikings, has to deal with both Vikings and monster. However, I was disappointed with one or two things. First, James Caviezel's acting could have been better. In my opinion, I found him to be rather flat and unemotional. The character (hero) he plays in this movie deserved better. I think Caviezel was trying to show the toughness of the character, but he did this to such an extent that you don't end up feeling enough sympathy for the character. Secondly, despite the fact that the writers go through the trouble of showing how the Outlander learns to speak Viking, the how of it is a kinda stupid (and for some reason painful) process. Nevertheless, the movie is still pretty good. Even the monster turned out to be an innovative creation that I didn't expect. Yes. I recommend this movie.

3548569,4,B001EAWMGA,"It would be easy to dismiss ""OUTLANDER"" as another direct-to-dvd popcorn snooze, but surprisingly, director Howard McCain effectively mixes in elements of a Norse-based adventure, science fiction and even an effective monster feature. It also has the cool elements that the male audience would be interested in; swordplay, macho posturing while using the backdrop of a period where superstition and myth reigns supreme. Oh, did I already mention that the film features a blood-thirsty monster from another planet?

Norway, 709 A.D. A spaceship crashes down to Earth, its lone survivor, an alien male called Kainan (Jim Caviezel, The Passion of the Christ) is left with very limited means in his quest to destroy a creature that has stowed away on board. Kainan follows a familiar pattern of destruction which leads him to be captured by a clan of Vikings who would like to get to the bottom of such destruction. Winning over the clan's king, Rothgar (John Hurt) and his daughter Freya (Sophie Myles), Kainan becomes poised to lead the charge against the Moorwen, an alien monster from another planet who had developed a taste for human flesh. Joining the charge is the head of a rival clan, Gunnar (Ron Perlman, Hellboy 2) as Kainan and Wulfric (Jack Huston) set out to vanquish the Moorwen, only to find that the primitive weapons of this time is no use against the ferociously, ravenous alien beast. Kainan had found something worth fighting for, but can courage and ingenuity truly win the day?

""Outlander"" may not be exactly groundbreaking but it makes use of its good points to generate an entertaining experience. The film is a straight-to-your-gut monster movie, with mild staples of sci-fi elements nicely mixed in with its Norse backdrop. The film isn't trying to be overly ambitious but it does know its target audience--it manipulates the male testosterone all the while appealing with its B-Grade charisma. Director Howard McCain knows how to appeal to those with a fetish for monster mayhem; it is full of bloody action and swordplay. The direction takes an almost ""comic book-like"" tone, with a cinematography that displays incredible scenery for this amazing events.

Amid all the monster mayhem, the film does have some strong bits of characterization. Kainan is a man torn by guilt with his alien race being hinted as nomads who takes over any habitable planet, even if it belonged to someone else. The links between him and the creature may have vengeance as the common denominator; Kainan wishes to avenge his family's death and the creature for his own kind. Kainan finds that he has similarities to this tribe of Vikings, and much like ""Dances with Wolves"" learns to love and respect them. His developing friendship with Rothgar, a rivalry with Wulfric and a boy named Eric are brought into exposition, as he even begins to harbor feelings for Freya, despite his love for his dead wife. Despite the fact that Kainan is an alien, he acts very human with out sensibilities.

The Viking clan are also developed as we are privy to their customs and their entertainment. We see them eat, dance, and play; they do act like Vikings. They are unkempt, dirty, and very rough around the edges. McCain does give us an idea of the Viking lifestyle, these guys do love wild boar and mead. It was also an exercise in careful scripting that the Vikings have become aware of Christianity, although it was a little underdeveloped that the idea felt a little forced.

This film has adventure written all over it, as the direction takes the action to caves, forests, underground and even underwater at times. The screenplay does succeed to generate some thrills as the Vikings do more than fight, as they try to cope with this other worldly menace with swords, axes, arrows and wobbly shields. The script is clever enough to guide out protagonists through this problem, with a sense of trial and error. Yes, ""Outlander"" does have numerous ""Man Versus Monster"" match ups--if at first you don't succeed, try again. The creature designs are inventive enough to keep me interested, it is however, a little disappointing that the creature is mostly designed from CGI. The CGI rendering feels a little uneven, as some shots look better than others. The film does have a mix of old-fashioned blood and gore on some kill scenes which pleased me, and the den of the beast was freaky, as we see its feeding ground.

""Outlander"" is a film with a nicely drawn-out plot and the script stays grounded enough to keep the flaws of the CGI effects from notice, as the creature is proven to have more personality than your usual eating machine. It is a refreshing approach to develop a monster that appears as a blood-thirsty beast at first look. The film does have some plot missteps as the third act requires a large suspension of disbelief. I find it hard to believe that any metal that can withstand re-entry in the atmosphere can be re-forged through the usual means. However, the film's script also manages to keep its energy as the film kept on moving.

I guess ""Outlander"" is worth a look. It is a great exercise in genre entertainment that has full-blooded adventure, action, sci-fi and a nice monster feature to get the job done in viewing entertainment. It is just responsive to genre needs; swords fashioned from a space craft, Viking fights, machismo, a glowing monster and even features a tattooed, hammer wielding Ron Perlman. The film is very easy to like and have fun with.

If the writers had altered a few basic points this would be a great film; for instance if the monster appeared to be even a tad sentient, the entire plot would become heavier. Also, The monster is too large, basically. This basic fact spoils most monster stories. The story plods along pretty well. The monster waits patiently while the characters develop their interactions and slight storyline. The ending is predictable and broadcast weakly, but it's still enjoyable.

  James Caviezel stars as an intergalactic policeman that crash lands on Earth in 700 A.D. Unfortunately for him and the Norsemen he encounters, there was a murderous alien monster stowaway on board.

  If you are thinking ""take-off of Beowulf"", then you are close. This film sounds like a hokey idea but it works. (Its also good to see Caviezel in a film where he is not screaming all the time.) The first twenty minutes were very cool and had me hooked. And I liked the underlying ecological theme, nice touch. I just wish the Sci-Fi channel could make ""CGI Monster of the Week"" movies this good.

I was expecting to be dissapointed by some cheesy low budget sci fi channel type film with poor acting, bad effects and terrible plot. What I got was the EXACT opposite. On the surface, you would think the premise of an alien warrior mixed up with Vikings is silly. But this movie pulls it off very well. I am not going to go into a synopsis, what I will tell you is, the special effects are very very good, better than a lot of higher budget movies I have seen, and the acting is very good from a cast largely of unknowns. As other reviewers have stated, there are a couple of cheesy moments, but the ambiance, and the tension that builds through the movie is phenomenal. For any discriminating sci fi fans, I guarantee you will love this movie. The creature has depth and believability that few movie monsters have achieved. The sets and locales are breath taking, the costumes should win an award alone. This is a GOOD movie. Reminds me of blade runner in that I think it slipped under the radar to become a cult classic.

I would recommend this movie to any Sci-Fi or action flick fan.  It's certainly better than many movies it's been compared to (i.e. Beowulf, Pathfinder, etc..).  My only gripe is that the DVD is somewhat sparce and the print is only decent.  Would love to see this film get a proper Blu-Ray treatment.",1245369600,,557,4.575757575757576

If you like Sci-Fi films, or period action films, you should see this movie. It has plenty of both. Some of the most intense action I've seen, along with plenty of good plot and character development, and the acting is also very well done. The scenery is incredible, and the special effects are only somewhat dated but still very good.

Like Pitch Black, this sleeper movie will definately please those action/adventure junkies out there that don't even have a clue about this fun and exciting film.

There are some big name actors here, and they do a decent enough job, but it is the alien monster and the pacing and look of the film that wins the day. Actor Jim Caviezel should stick with these types of movies.

Others around here mention B-Movie status. Well, I would suffice it to say that it is a bit more than B-Movie fare. A-Minus Movie fare (if there was such a thing) would be more like it! It is very well done, very well cast, and one can tell that a lot of care went into the making of this film. It is too bad that it didn't get more of a theatrical release. What does one have to do these days to get their movie in a theater besides cater to the completely talentless, like Miley Cyrus, and the semi-talentless, like the Jonas Brothers?
Only one drawback with this one IMO, and it has been mentioned here on many accounts:
Not enough of Ron Perlman and his character. His role could have had loads to do with the entire production, but it was definitely a throw-away. Too Bad! Other than that...a great time!

3548594,3,B001EAWMGA,"An alien named Kainan crash-lands on the planet Earth sometime during the reign of the Vikings.  He brings with him a monstrous carnivore hell-bent on killing and eating everything in its path.  Together, Kainan and the Vikings must band together to save themselves...assuming the primitive weaponry is a match for the alien predator.

OUTLANDER isn't quite what it could have been.  It's riddled with cliches--lines, dialogue, camera-angles, plot twists, all erected upon a mountain of predictability.  However, OUTLANDER has three things going for it that help to elevate it (if only slightly) above the level of its peers.  The first is Jim Caviezel, who brings surprising strength to the lead role.  The second is John Hurt, as the leader of the Viking tribe that initially captures Kainan, only to come to rely upon his expertise.  The third is an interesting plot twist that questions the viewer's sympathy: Do we side with the dashing and unbelievably handsome alien warrior, or the ugly, supposedly blood-thirsty animal?  This level of discomfort isn't exploited nearly as well as it should be; suffice it to say, the carnivore has good reason to hate Kainan, and vice versa.

Note that I didn't include Ron Perlman anywhere; he is grossly under-used, in a throw-away part that is a complete waste of his talent.  This is just one of many disappointments that makes OUTLANDER a mixed-bag of a film.  It could have been a truly thoughtful film; instead, it's little more than some dazzling special effects and a totally awesome ""villain.""  Of course, that's probably more than enough to keep most viewers happy; and if that's what you want, then OUTLANDER certainly delivers.",1243123200,6,1682,5.072727272727272

3548596,4,B001EAWMGA,"The first I ever heard of Outlander was in an ad page in last month's Fangoria.  It looked and sounded like typical straight to video B movie fair.  This is sometimes a very good and fun thing, and other times absolutely dreadful.  From sifting through some other Amazon reviews regarding this film I found that it had a very, VERY,  limited theatrical run and apparently was bashed by critics.  Well, I still haven't read any 'professional' reviews for Outlander and I'm here to tell you that it's totally worth two hours of your life, especially if you're a creature feature fan and, even better, a sword and sandels epic fan.

Basically, the premise of this movie is if Army Of Darkness was taken seriously.  We have a space man(from another dimension?  The future?  Antoher planet?) who crashes his space ship onto earth in the year 709 and brings a big monster with him, that of course escapes and starts problems for the local Viking villages and tribes.  That's it.  That's the story.  Nothing monumental or groundbreaking but totally fun.  Hell, this movie has the type of story I would have written myself when I was ten and wanted even more to see it in the multiplex.

Don't get mislead by the Sci-Fi sounding premise, this is nothing close to true Science Fiction.  It's a big action/horror/ monster movie on the most base levels.  There's no science or hypothesis of the future or past of man to be found.  Sorry, it just doesn't reach that high above it's B movie roots, and that is not always a bad thing if it's done well.  It's obviously one of those films that has many different producers, most of which are not from the states, but the budget and level of polish on the production could be matched to any of the big summer films coming out now.  The sets are good and have the dirty lived in quality required for anything involving Vikings.  The CGI creature is mostly convincing.  There's a few shots where the beast looks less then stellar but not many.  The filmmakers were even smart, considering budget and suspense, by not revealing the creature in full light until the center of the film.  It reminded me of the old Roger Corman creature features, but he waited until the third act, well, because his monsters never looked that convincing and were always more convincing when off screen.  This could've been a big summer film of 09.  Of course it's not a remake, a film based on action figures, one of several sequels to 20 year old properties, and of course there's no car, fast food or toy tie-ins to speak of, but it still could've given me what I long for this summer, something NEW.

The cast is all on spot.  Jim Caviezel(The Passion of the Christ, The Thin Red Line, Frequency) stars, and I've always found him to be an underrated actor.  He's turning into the king of big films that don't get a shot theatrically but become fan favorites on home video thanks to this and Highwaymen(if you haven't seen it, check it out).  The movie even throws us the usual respected older actor in the form of John Hurt to play the Viking king.  He's good as always and brings that extra John Hurt-ness he always brings to his roles, big or small.  If you've read Beouwulf you can figure out where the plot is going and what it's riffing on but the added Sci-Fi trope helps throw you off for a bit.  This isn't going to go down as one of Caviezel's great performances, but he does lend dramatic gravity to what essentially is the typical monosyllobic hero with a past role.  After about an hour his characters comes more into his own and leaves behind the usual action character cliche's thanks to him.  Ron Perlman shows up late into the film as an opposing tribes leader.  He's not give much to do, and I'm not sure why they cast an actor of his caliber for such an nothing part, but it's nice to see him anyway.

The DVD looks and sounds great.  Plus, it's loaded with special features.  We get some neat special effects tests and animatics of the action scenes, which there are plenty of, and while they're nothing ground breaking, they are done well and leave one feeling satisfied.  There's also a great commentary track by the writers, director, producers and special effects technicians that covers so much ground there is no need for a making of doc.  They also react to their critics and talk about the original forms of the script.  Of course there's also 40 minutes worth of deleted scenes, all of which were rightfully ommitted from the final film.  There is an intersting alternate opening that's worth a look though.  Can't say the same for the alternate ending.

At least give this one a shot at a rental.  You won't be disappointed.  Sure, the man from outer space might turn some viewers off, but I emplore you to open your mind and just smile while the B movie ride takes you away.  Don't be scared off by the lack of Happy Meals and Tom Cruise level of star power tie-ins. This is a quality B picture on the level of all the big budget B pictures you'll be plopping down 12 bucks to see this summer in theatres.  Yes, I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and Terminator:Salvation.",1242864000,49,5116,4.527808069792803
3548597,4,B001EAWMGA,"Being a sci-fi/horror fan, I was initially leery of this movie because of past disappointments in the genre. But, the positive reviews swayed me and my hubby and I watched it tonight - it was fun, entertaining, with humor, intelligent writing, and above-average performances by the cast.

Compared to the lackluster ""Pathfinder"", ""Outlander"" may have a rather cheesy premise, but it ultimately delivers [though it too suffers from some plodding scenes]. Jim Caviezel [who played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ] plays alien Kainan who crashes down to Earth, circa 709 A.D. and lands in Norway. Trouble is he is not alone as his spacecraft also harbored a Moorwen, a beast that looks like a hybrid dragon/alien/predator [from those movies] and which can glow with an eerie reddish luminescence. The beast also has a huge appetite - for human flesh.

Kainan is taken captive by the Vikings who have a settlement nearby, under the rule of King Rothgar [John Hurt] who has a fiesty daughter Freya [Sophia Myles], and whom he loves dearly. Rothgar's heir apparent is Wulfric [Jack Huston] who plans to wed Freya. Initially, Kainan is regarded with suspicion, taking into consideration the decimation of a neighboring settlement. His tales of hunting down a dragon-like creature is met with disbelief and anger, but it is only later that the villagers discover the truth of his words. Kainan and company band together [later joined by angry rival chieftain Gunnar played by Ron Perlman, in a brief but memorable role] to destroy the moorwen, and the rest of the movie is dedicated to this quest.

The premise may seem rather like a B-movie type story, but it actually works here - almost everything is explained during the course of the movie, and credibly played out. The creature effects are not too bad - could have done with more sophisticated effects especially in the flashback sequences to Kainan's past, but on the whole it wasn't disappointing.

There are even a couple of twists thrown in that suprised me - having to do with the characterization of the moorwen. Final verdict - this is definitely one of the better sci-fi/horror creature features, and a couple of notches above some of the pathetic drivel shown on the Sci-Fi channel.",1242777600,2,2242,4.938992042440319

We have inter-planetary travel, love, loss, awesome looking dragon creatures with firefly (glowing) capabilities, all intertwined within the Norse time period of our history. Caviezel has just the right look to be the believable yet fearless fighter that hunts these creatures across the universe.

The effects looked adequate, and excelled during any of the ship sequences off planet. I have read most of the criticisms about pacing, time period gaffs and such, but overall I think they made a solid film. The DVD has over 32 minutes of deleted scenes that help answer some of the questions raised while watching the theatrical cut (which runs 115 minutes itself). The alternate opening would have helped with the end - but watching a space ship spiral towards Earth works better. The scenes with his Captain would have been nice to see in the main cut, as would most of the others but oh well. Some nice informative supplements for the special effects also.
