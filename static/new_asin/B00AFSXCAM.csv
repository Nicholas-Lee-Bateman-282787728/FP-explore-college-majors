5424062,5,B00AFSXCAM,"One of the best works of French cinema last year. A very touchy topic (I won't be a spoiler) presented in a way very common and unique for low budget French films, for ever. Highly recommended.",1392940800,4,193,4.388888888888889
5424063,4,B00AFSXCAM,"This is a very witty, stylish, very French film.  As another reviewer wrote, ""only the French can make a film about an argument.""  He didn't like it but I did.  I've spent enough time at French family dinners to recognize the style--lots of talk---lots of ideas---lots of strong opinions.. Some people will hate the fact that they are arguing but I found it very human and warm.  The acting is all superb.  It's not a block buster, ha-ha kind of comedy but if you like this genre, you might really enjoy this film.  I did.",1458345600,,522,4.442105263157894
5424064,2,B00AFSXCAM,Too long and boring for the point/s made.  Good writing and acting.,1452902400,,67,4.583333333333333
5424065,5,B00AFSXCAM,Lol funny!,1448323200,,10,4.5
5424066,5,B00AFSXCAM,"I love French Cinema. I actually tried to see this film for a long time and although my French is good I needed it with subtitles just to make sure I did not miss anything. It was fast, wild extravagant. I thought I was the onlooker at a dinner party whose guests did not know I was there. It was pure pathos with a wide range of emotions and am fled to have a copy of it. I will watch it again. I only wish my father could have seen it as would have looked at it and enjoyed it as was a great lover of French Cinema and would have treated the film with delight.

The plot is interesting and although not great on location makes up for the characters who are rich, charming and typically French so if you enjoy a good story told well and full of life watch it or do not and be disappointed.",1446422400,3,790,3.9685534591194966
5424067,1,B00AFSXCAM,Looooooong and couldn't hold my attention. Never finished it.,1443830400,,61,5.888888888888889
5424068,4,B00AFSXCAM,"I enjoyed this French movie, the banter, the continued play on a name, and the well written script. The actors were believable and played off each other well. It was easy to believe they were friends and family spending the evening together.",1443139200,3,241,4.761904761904762
5424069,5,B00AFSXCAM,"Excellent film, funny and serious at the same time.",1443139200,,51,4.777777777777778
5424070,2,B00AFSXCAM,"The start of the movie was excellent, but after 1/2h, there was endless arguing until the bitter end! Almost disturbing.
Patrick Bruel was the only good actor, he is brilliant. All the others were amateurs and the main female character has a very nasty voice pitch.",1439337600,,265,4.782608695652174
5424071,4,B00AFSXCAM,Very cute and entertaining French film- enjoyed very much!,1438128000,,58,5.555555555555555
5424072,2,B00AFSXCAM,Did not like it. Boring.,1431734400,,24,4.0
5424073,1,B00AFSXCAM,"Impossible to follow the movie and subtitles at the same time.  The dialog is rapid fire.  I gave up and left it for another day.  Buy Amazon didn't offer any ""later"".",1430697600,,167,4.32258064516129
5424074,2,B00AFSXCAM,"Only gets going near half way through, only the French can make a movie of one argument, Theres many I like, but this is tedious, some sparse funny moments, one good laugh near end, had I not got free with prime I would have considered it wasted money.",1428969600,,252,4.270833333333333
5424075,5,B00AFSXCAM,This film is a bit quirky with a definite European flavor and extremely witty and enjoyable.,1426636800,,92,4.8125
5424076,3,B00AFSXCAM,I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I anticipated more interaction rather than discussion.,1425513600,,96,5.466666666666667
5424077,5,B00AFSXCAM,"I found it to hilarious and poignant, wonderfully acted and cast. It was laugh out loud for me often and I found my self tearing up at other times.  What a gem.  I highly recommend this film.",1422748800,,191,4.135135135135135
5424078,5,B00AFSXCAM,"Grand Cinema! This stage play turned film is brilliant in every aspect - gripping and laugh-out-loud funny, even if you're reading the subtitles. Bravo!",1420588800,,152,5.375

5424084,4,B00AFSXCAM,there is more to this movie than it appears at first. well constructed comedy that grows to full bloom.,1408492800,,103,4.473684210526316
5424085,5,B00AFSXCAM,"A dysfunctional (but loving) family at its best. Wonderfully clever writing, and superb acting. This is a movie I'd happily watch over and over again. It gets intense at times, but their comedic timing is perfect so it never actually turns into a drama. There is never a dull moment in this movie which will end up leaving you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. You might even burn a few calories along the way from all of the laughing.",1406419200,,432,4.4125
5424086,1,B00AFSXCAM,"Except for the first third of the movie, this is not a comedy.  It is a wordy drama about an intimate group of friends and family who dredge up each others secrets and tear each other apart.  I really did not like it.  It showed people at their worst.  Maybe it is something that you have to be a native speaker of French to appreciate.  I watch a lot of foreign language movies and this is the first one I disliked so much in more years than I can recall.",1406332800,,456,4.022222222222222
5424087,5,B00AFSXCAM,"Superb acting and a rapid and amusing script. We watched it a second time the following night. It's a familiar play structure -- a long party where secrets get spilled and each actor get his or her big moment. (You can almost hear the ovations, especially the one for the long-suffering hostess!) I would have preferred not to have the nuisance ""opening up"" of the tight play structure by extraneous scenes and even by bringing into our view a character who'd have better remained offstage, as I'm sure she must have been in the original. But all in all great energetic entertainment.",1401667200,2,584,4.735294117647059
5424088,4,B00AFSXCAM,"Great dialogue

Good rhythm and good acting.

5424089,5,B00AFSXCAM,Wonderful! Loved watching every minute of it. Sophisticated story line. Acting was superb. It was a real treat to watch this film.  I didn't expect to have so much fun.,1398038400,,168,4.6
5424090,4,B00AFSXCAM,"This is one of these great French movies that are probably adapted from a play. Most scenes take place between 3 rooms (kitchen, dining room, living room). We witness an evening between 2 couples + 1 friend, their conversations, their jokes, their arguments. It reminds me of home, so I am probably biased, but I am pretty sure you will enjoy it as well if you appreciate this kind of intimate and subtly funny movies.",1395878400,5,418,4.586666666666667
5424091,5,B00AFSXCAM,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, a la Francaise. All but a few minutes of the film consists of quick repartee during the course of a small dinner party in a modest Paris apartment, with a cast of characters who definitely know how to turn a phrase or two.  ""Le prenom"" in question is just the pretext for an evening of sniping, soul-searching and soul baring that has more twists and turns than a bowl of fusilli. Best of all, in true French cinematic comedy fashion, after the knock down, drag out fight that unfolds before our eyes, and seemingly against all odds, little blood is spilled, and all ends more or less happily ever after, in a bittersweet sort of way.

Well worth watching.",1395532800,10,688,4.540322580645161
5424092,5,B00AFSXCAM,"This film feels as if it were originally a play (not that that's a bad thing) but if I am wrong someone should bring it to live theater. Great dialogue, interesting, intelligent characters, humor, surprises one after another and all taking place at a small dinner party between friends. Loved it. Highly recommended.",1393459200,6,316,4.981132075471698

8551148,4,B00AFSXCAM,I love the first part of the movie. The discussions about the names is smart and funny. The cultural comments are good and picture the French mentality. On the other hand i found the other part of the movie too dramatically exagerated...,1502150400,,237,4.666666666666667
8551149,5,B00AFSXCAM,"Days later I am still pondering this movie!!!  It is a great premise, acted out superbly, with a lot of moments that offer the viewer contemplation of their own ideals and morals and values.  And then it is funny, poignant, and terribly wonderful to watch.  Highly recommend it!!",1495843200,2,279,4.770833333333333
