5124213,5,B0082GN8T4,"Unless you are color blind you see blood as it is... deep red. This color film of the war shows the true horrors of the war that yes even killed children. This is truth and you see it in your face from these war reporters as it happened. The war has been glamorized for years and has had sugar poured over it to lessen its horrors.i am a person who looks for truth no matter how perverted,disgusting, or beautiful it may be.  These DVDs show truth. I am totally moved by watching it as I too served but not in a combat scenario. ... An unnerving fact- the war is not over until every veteran moves on and leaves  his nightmares and this earth. .. Corey",1367539200,2,652,4.166666666666667

5124217,5,B0082GN8T4,The best series on World War II that I have ever seen.  I purchased 5 sets for my family.  I was also shocked at how inexpensive it was.,1404172800,,136,3.8214285714285716

5124219,5,B0082GN8T4,"Probably one of the best war documentaries ever made.  I've seen them all.  Nice seeing original footage and on topics usually ignored, such as quartermaster and supply divisions, and the carnage suffered by British air crews.

It will give you a broader picture of the war, other than the usual combat segments that have been used and re-used since the war ended.

My only complaint is that there is the usual hoard of German and Japanese bodies shown, but few American.  I think after 70 years we can stop censoring the war.",1399593600,7,526,4.673913043478261
5124220,5,B0082GN8T4,Strong color footage of just about every aspect of the war. The color is pretty good considering the age and really makes you feel like how it really was since there was much more than just black & white to life in those times!,1399161600,3,227,4.181818181818182
5124221,5,B0082GN8T4,"It still comes as a shock to me to see how much World War 2 film footage was shot in color. When I first started studying WW2, I thought everything was strictly black and white. If you want a generous sampling of what was shot, you can't go too far wrong ordering TCW. The series which played on the History Channel, contains actual combat footage, snippets from training and indoctrination films, and even personally shot footage. The dvd set had good sound and picture quality and actually gave you a kind of ""you are there"" sensation that you can't get as much from black and white footage. I loved the series and finally getting it on dvd makes it one of the stars of my world war 2 collection.",1391904000,3,698,4.4186046511627906
5124222,3,B0082GN8T4,"The producers limited this documentary to ""color only"" footage.  This means that the stories they tell are less complete than they could have been if they had used both color and black/white footage.

Instead of covering places or battles or events in detail, the documentary is split into war topics (see the list of episodes at the end of my review). Do you want to learn about what happened at Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, or the Philippines?  You won't get that with this DVD set.  You may hear bits and pieces about some of these places/battles in several episodes.

Some documentaries that cover WWII (ones that use color and black/white footage) concentrate on places/battles/events; they not only show more complete footage, but their narration/explanation of what is occurring in the footage is more complete.

Every episode had a theme, yet they still lacked focus; almost every episode either bounced around from theater to theater or spanned the entire war period (or both) in one 45 minute episode.

There were no veteran interviews. That was disappointing. Instead, ""the voices of soldiers, commanders, and civilians come to life through letters, diaries and battlefield communiques.""

Some of the footage was repeated among the episodes.  Most of the footage was new to me.  Some of the footage was familiar (also shown in other documentaries).

Despite some of these negatives, I thought the series was worthwhile.  There was footage that I have not seen before, and I learned things from the narrative.

8524232,2,B0082GN8T4,"This particular release of the  series is fine if you are okay with forgoing the COMPLETE series which includes another four episodes. I returned when I realized three were missing. I wish I had read all the reviews before buying. I had only mentioned three in my return request, but there are four left out of this RE RELEASE. Apparently the version with ALL episodes is the 2002 release NOT this one. It would be helpful to include an episode guide in the description as I had to OPEN the case to view the discs and then see which episodes were omitted.",1528588800,,555,4.4411764705882355

http://www.amazon.com/The-History-Channel-Presents-Color/dp/B000CRR33I
The garbage listed here is missing 4 of the original episodes and has a running time of 587 minutes.
The complete series is being sold for $100 + around the web with a stated running time of 13 + hours

Edit: The reviews for the two sets listed below are the same, but they are different sets!  The first set is for the incomplete rip-off 13 episode edition I threw my money away on here. The second one is the complete series of 17 episodes. Please be careful as the same vendors are linked to both of the editions.  I have not found the complete series online for under $100.
