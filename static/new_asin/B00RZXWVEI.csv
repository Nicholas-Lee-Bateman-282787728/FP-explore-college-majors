8696582,5,B00RZXWVEI,"I would say this is a biased review since I eventually ended up working on this film, but in truth there is none.

When I first came in contact with this film, it was in the capacity as editor. What I was faced with was a disaster, an unbelievable mess and all in one finished file. The director , Mark Mackner was a positive dude, I couldn't say no to the hopeful look in his eyes and so I accepted the challenge.

As I started working on Daisy, I fell in love with the film. It was terrible in the most charming way. It is impossible to fake genuine heart, and this film bleeds with every beat.

I recommend this film to all lovers of low budget independent film, schlock, horror and disturbing exploitation.

Watch it with friends, intoxicated if possible.",1457308800,,759,4.361702127659575
8696583,3,B00RZXWVEI,"Daisy (Susanna D'Arcy perhaps best known for her remarkable performance as Prof. Greta Murderchristmas in ""A Muy El Gaucho Navidad"") gets a gig as a dog sitter for Mookie at the residence of Silas Killington (Mark Mackner who has played the same character in ""Evil Brew,""""Skee-tit-zin,"" and ""St. Blacktrick."" ) He is confused about the name of his dog calling him Cerberus instead of Mookie, the feared three position outfielder for the New York Mets. Daisy has some friends over, while some women who look like the Oink sisters get killed by an escaped psychopathic killer (James Christopher Black- best known as Joe Naslex - Conspiracy Theorist in ""Punk Rock Holocaust 2."") who happens to be pen pals with one of the several visitors (Christine Fisler who plays the succubus leader in the highly anticipated ""Midnight Show"") Daisy has over to play Ouija Board. The lights go out in the house, except for the other rooms where they need to film.

This black and white feature was based on a colorized short feature of the same name which is also included in the DVD (I thought it was better, but that could be because it was shorter.) The film swings back and forth between ""So bad it is good"" like the pillow fight scene to ""So bad it is bad"" also like the pillow fight scene. There is some satire within the film such as when we have a local occult TV star says ""boobs and the occult"" is why people watch her show, clearly a statement about the success of Cassandra Peterson. We love you Elvira.

This film is not for everyone, and in fact it is not for most people.

Guide: F-word. No nudity. Bestiality rape. (Don't pet the dog on the head, it turns him on.)",1456876800,,1663,4.555183946488294
8696584,5,B00RZXWVEI,"Daisy Derkins Dogsitter of the Damned is a decently made (all things considered), ultra-super-mega low budget horror comedy from film maker Mark Mackner. Shot in B&W (thats black and white for you youngin's out there) Daisy Derkins Dogsitter of the Damned can be seen as sort a tribute to the Ed Wood/Ray Dennis Steckler/Coleman Francis school of movie making.  The cast is interesting and the story is pretty simple: a student hoping to earn extra cash takes a dog sitting gig from a creepy, hooded dude. She invites over her chick pals and in traditional horror movie fashion all manner of crazed events begin to transpire. Long story short, the movie manages combine such elements as demon dogs, serial killers, paranormal investigators, creepy daters and a even a wendigo, into a rather enjoyable if not 100 percent believable romp. This movie has something for everyone at least if you're a demented B-movie fan like myself.",1433289600,2,929,4.993548387096774
