7968890,5,B00006HCOZ,Why is it that the British have so many comedic geniuses?  Who knows and who cares as long as you can order a set like this to enjoy.  Very fresh and original and like nothing you've ever seen on Merrikan telly.  Wish there were more like this.  And did you know that Sanjeev and Meera are a married couple?,1268179200,,307,4.1525423728813555
7968891,5,B00006HCOZ,"I really love British comedy. There is no other humor that is this funny in the style of the Brits. This holds true for BBC's Goodness Gracious Me as well. I have looked for these DVD's for years and I'll buy them even though they aren't region 1. Most new laptops and portable TV's play the disks just fine. Two of the shows I remember as being side splitting funny are the episodes with the guy that feels everything and everyone, even Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, were Indian. My other favorite is the one where the family was burgled and can't seem to figure out how the culprit got in. I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it because it is absolutely screamingly funny. This show will always give your spirit a great uplift with humor. I highly recommend it!",1258761600,,764,4.387323943661972

This is a wonderful British sketch comedy with a style reminiscent of great (and absurd series) like MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS.  This show's strength is in its hilarious writing, strong direction and wonderful ensemble.  The cast is made up of almost exclusively Indian-British actors (with the exception of the ""token"" Caucasian comedians we see on occasion in some of the sketches, usually with race roles reversed--Whites are the ""odd"" ones and Asians are the mainstream here).  The sketches take on topics such as the pronunciation (and mispronunciation) of names--in this case, the lone White-British businessman, Jonathan, comes to work for a prestigious Indian company and no one can pronounce his name (a problem commonly faced by those from Asian countries, and other cultures as well).  They also alternate sketches on assimilation with songs (often parodies of popular music).  There are also very funny recurring characters who poke fun at the immigrant/Indian experience.  They include the Bangra boys (two thugged out young men who frequent the clubs and even star in their own music video at the end of Episode One), and the Kapoors (pronounced ""Coopers""), a couple of Indian-Asians desperate to assimilate into upper class British society, just to name a couple.
This show only lasted for a few seasons (1998-2000) and I have no idea why because it was so funny!  I highly recommend this.",1209772800,14,1491,5.1875
7968893,4,B00006HCOZ,"If that show was your cup of tea, then so is ""Goodness Gracious Me""! It's got most of the same staff and cast, you see. And the unwrinkled Meera Syal, (aka ""Granny"")!",1201392000,,166,4.21875
7968894,5,B00006HCOZ,"A lot has been said about this series over the years, some of it not very complimentary. Some Asians have even said that this series is made for a ""White"" audience, but having been raised as a British born Asian I can relate to many of the skits such as the attempt to Anglicize my name, and the appalling behaviour of some people in Indian restaurants which can border on the being downright racist to the point where you realise that many Indian waiters must have the patience of a saint when it comes to some of their white customers.

This series turns these stereotypical images totally on their head, and I have to admit that I find ""Goodness Gracious Me"" one of the funniest comedy series on TV and now you can have some of that rib-cracking outrageous fun is now on video/DVD.

Meera Syal of Bhaji on the Beach fame along with her gang of British born/raised Asians act in a variety of hilarious skits which give us a taste of what it is like to live in Britain as second and third generation Asians but still be strangers in a familiar land.

You get to meet the Kapoor's who like to be called Cooper because they are ""BRITISH"" and wannabe whites, you also get a bevy of funny but often thought provoking songs one of which coined that wonderful catchphrase, ""Kiss my chuddies.""

Don't miss the two warring mothers who compete to prove that they alone have the most perfect son who is the best at everything even being a criminal!

This is a great series that has become a classic in its own lifetime.  Everyone can enjoy it no matter what colour, ethnic group or religion they are; so chill out, sit down and enjoy this great video and/or DVD, it's lots of fun, it's sometimes rude, it's often hilarious and who cares if it is not politically correct all the time, what comedy series ever is?",1156118400,7,1802,4.429003021148036
