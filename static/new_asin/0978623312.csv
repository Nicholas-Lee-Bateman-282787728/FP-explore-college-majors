7794861,5,0978623312,"I first met Norman Lloyd on May 15, 1970 on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Cambodia after a chopper was shot down and he was filming the event for Water Cronkite and CBS news.  I was with the 199th LIB and was attached to the 1st Cav in Cambodia.  I had no idea until a week ago what he has done with the footage he shot.  He continued to film soldiers in many wars and in many countries and has not only put together one of the finest collections in the World, he has donated the proceeds to the Veterans to help them.  Norman is from Australia although he now lives in California.  This particular film won the Best Documentary at the Short Film Festival in 2006 I believe.  It is incredible and accurate and as real as it gets.  This film needs to be in every school's history class so our children and grandchildren can learn from it.  It is touching, moving and so real you can almost taste it.  Outstanding job, a MUST for anyone who has any interest at all in combat or history.  This tells and shows it like it was!",1497571200,,1017,4.142857142857143

I was in B/229th Assault Aviation Battalion,1st Cavalry Division, which provided lift ships to this unit while in Cambodia. Because of their actions in May-June 1970, it sure got quiet the last half of my tour in Vietnam and a lot of American soldiers came home because of it. This documentary is extremely well done and I highly recommend it.",1448582400,,481,4.950617283950617
7794863,5,0978623312,"I served with B Company, 5t Battalion / 7th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) as an Infantryman / RTO (Radio Telephone Operator) until December 1969.  Shakey's Hill is the story of their search and destroy mission into Cambodia.  So I guess you could say I'm biased toward this film whether I know it or not.

The film is very well composed and choreographed, and the reality of ground warfare shines through because what you see here is real.  The interviews with some infantrymen both in 1970 and in 2004 are so emotional; vivid memories come back into sharp focus.

I recommend this documentary to all audiences.",1417910400,3,629,4.787037037037037
7794864,5,0978623312,We have a vested interest in Shakey's Hill because it tells the story of my nephew Chris Keffalos (Shakey) who gave is life in Cambodia serving our country. It's a great and inspiring documentary about the rigor's of war and the human sacrifice that freedom always requires. Reflecting on the past and present deployment of the 5th Battalion Seventh Calvary Unit we can't help but be thankful that the USA has such committed and courageous men and women who serve tirelessly to protect our freedom. A must see for anyone who appreciates the armed forces and those who serve valiantly even to the giving of their lives for others.,1373587200,6,629,4.779816513761468
