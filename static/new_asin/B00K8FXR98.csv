8656812,5,B00K8FXR98,"I am a parent of four year old twins and we are constantly in a power struggle. This DVD in one hour taught me simple tips and strategies to use in these types of situations and also reminded me that even when they are acting like defiant teenagers, they are really still just 4. The best part is that she gives you concrete examples of what to say in both everyday life and difficult moments. It has really helped me change my frame of thinking as a parent. Would love to see more DVDs.",1408492800,,487,4.191489361702128
8656813,5,B00K8FXR98,"I bought this video at a perfect time.  My daughter has been going through a developmental leap that has been packed with change and confusion (for all of us!).  I have several go to books on development that I find helpful but it was really effective to see Barbara talking about parenting challenges with parents. Between her broader strokes of developmental information and the specific stories of parents it deepened my understanding of what my daughters needs are from me as a parent.

  Her tips help deepen connection and thus cooperation while still maintaining the importance of boundaries for children as well.  It is balanced and practical.  I'm grateful to have it in my library of tools and I am sure I will return to it many times!",1403049600,,745,4.7734375
8656814,5,B00K8FXR98,"As a soon to be parent, I found Barbara Olinger incredibly grounding. She's full of parental wisdom and easy-to-follow parenting approaches to address all the concerns of newbie parents. In the DVD you meet parents facing challenges at home or in school. Barbara covers a range of critically important topics from how to build a child's self-esteem; transitioning them from tasks or activities  to addressing tantrums and conflicts. She not only explains the issue, but gives parents simple tips and techniques to elicit responsiveness from a child.

One of the points I appreciated most is when she talks about how children shouldn't fear, or feel bad in order to change behavior - that children are motivated to change a behavior if their needs are met. Her nonjudgmental approach counters everything I experienced as a child. I loved how she demonstrates that parents can parent by guiding instead of controlling, and how to build trust within the child that will recalibrate the motives of a child to be his or her best self.

Ultimately, her approach is to support children within their developmental stage and to focus on the motivation of the child instead of on the behavior, and giving meaning to what we ask them to do. It's such a loving way to parent, and based on her experience as a parent and head of school, it's 'tried and true!'

Thank you Ms. Olinger!",1402099200,,1370,4.8418803418803416
