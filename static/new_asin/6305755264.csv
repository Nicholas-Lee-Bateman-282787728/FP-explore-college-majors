7893790,4,6305755264,"This show includes a live Blondie Chaplin performance of the song 52 Letters from his great and still unreleased 2001 Fragile Thread album.  Blondie performs on acoustic and vocals with the house band backing him up.  A rare glimpse of Blondie performing live and an even rarer glimpse at a track from his masterwork Fragile Thread album (which is available in the collector's circuit).

For other live Blondie Chaplin, check out In The Groove on VHS, an Anton Fig drumming instruction video also available here at Amazon which has three songs from his Ostrich Man album performed live.",1194134400,,586,4.959183673469388
7893791,5,6305755264,"The First Waltz is a must see for any fan of The Band, Smashing Pumpkins, Rick Nielsen, Lonnie Brooks and a host of other stars, including some of the best performers the Chicago music scene has to offer. The movie was  shot in HDTV, and proves that concert quality sound is now available on  video.
The appearance of Billy Corgan Jr. ( Smashing Pumpkins ) with his  father is a moment that they will both cherish forever. Any fan of the  Pumpkins (or fathers and sons for that matter) should see this exuberant  performance.
The death of Rick Danko is hauntingly foreshadowed in the  videos final performance of ""The Weight"", one of Dankos final  live appearances. His death last year, has many of the members of this  performance stunned into speechlessness and tears to this day.
The  concert and video proceeds go entirely to a local Chicago charity. Nicolas  Tremulis gives an exceptional performance as musical host. Tremulis'  musical performance is bested only by his tremendous effort to produce this  concert and video.
The video was directed by Dan Andries. Equal credit  must be given to Andries, and his crew for this outstanding production. I  hope to see The Second Waltz on video next spring.",960163200,4,1208,4.829268292682927
7893792,5,6305755264,"I was at this show and most taken with it as a performance.  And it was fabulous to see such diversity on stage - a fact reflected obviously in this video.  A great curiosity for fans of Chicago music, Cheap Trick,  those Pumpkins, Neville Brothers, and of course the Band.  Great that  proceeds go to charity - this video will delight you.  Just wish it were on  DVD.",952214400,2,368,4.323529411764706

The video also features Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins (with his father!), and Rick Danko of The Band, among others.  Looking forward to seeing the video of this recent charity event, which was  well reviewed at the time.",951264000,2,314,4.886792452830188
