4314868,5,B004BBDHFO,"This is amazing.  I will never do any other kind of workout again.  Its a lifestyle for sure and this has completely changed mine.  Everyone needs to own this DVD and at this price, what a great gift for a girlfriend!",1299801600,2,217,4.2439024390243905
4314869,5,B004BBDHFO,"This is a top notch barre routine! Andrea is a terrific instructor. She is clear, precise and non-irritating! The entire workout is great. The warm-up, upper body, barre-for legs and seat, abs and stretch are all the perfect amount of time for each area worked and the exercises she chooses hit all the muscles you want to work to full exhaustion. I absolutely loved it and this workout is one of my Best purchases in a long time! The set is beautiful and the music is good too.
Thanks Andrea!

4314870,5,B004BBDHFO,"Here is a break out of the DVD:

Warm Up (5:59):
This includes a mix of plie squats (legs hip distance apart), wide second position plies, and first position plies.  The plies alternate with pointing the leg out to the side and leg lifts. This includes some plie squats with hands reaching overhead, alternating with lifting the knee forward and reaching the hands under the knee, and then doing leg lifts without the plie but still reaching hands under the knee. This was a nice variation on the traditional march used in many barre DVDs. She also has curtsy squats alternating with tendu and then with pass. There are a variety of hand movements throughout the sequence.  The warm up had a nice pace to it - fast but not too fast.  There is a modifier showing easier versions throughout.

Upper Body (11:14) (requires 1, 2, or 3 lb weights):
It wasn't a particularly challenging workout but I liked how she took fairly traditional exercises and added ballet inspired twists to them - for example, circular movements with the arms or crossing the arms.  She includes bicep and tricep work.  She also had a couple variations reaching the arms overhead, including standing on the supporting leg in first position and doing a tendu to the back, side and front.  The next segment is done without weights. She starts alternating second position plie with arabesque and then holds the arabesque doing various arm movements to challenge balance. She closes the segment with tricep dips, reverse plank, knee pushups, and plank.  This segment was really fun and it felt really good (I had a kink under one shoulder blade prior to this segment that went away after.)

Barre (23:34) (need a chair for support):
o Parallel leg, first position, and wide second position plies - heels down alternating with toe raises, and then pulsing with toes raised
o Alternating between first and second position plie (modifier does these with a jump)
o Front attitude with pulses
o Second position plie alternating with circling the leg to the front
o Parallel leg plie pulses on toes (releve), then repeated with upper body in a c-curve
o Second position plie alternating with rotating to the side and first position plie (the modifier adds jumps to this)
o lunges on toes
o holding high lunge with circular upper body movement, arms reached overhead
o standing quadriceps stretch
o Standing glute work with variety of leg pulses to the side
o Curtsy alternating with pass, and then leg extension. She repeats these taking your hand off the chair to challenge your balance
o Standing glute work pulsing leg to the back. There is an option to remove one hand off the chair to work balance, and then finally holding the back leg extension with both arms off the chair
o Figure-4 standing stretch

Core (9:40):
o Various leg movements with upper body resting on elbows
o High c-curve, one leg raised and extended, rotating to the side
o Lower to mat, legs extended long - curling and twisting the upper body while raising the opposite leg
o Crunch with twist while doing scissor switch with legs
o Roll up with arm movement
o Side lying leg lift, upper body resting on elbow
o Side forearm plank
o Twisting pilates teaser
o Cobra

Cool Down (5:17):
Includes seated stretch variations.  From standing there are arabesque variations to challenge the balance. She then does standing stretches for the spine, rolling forward, extending back, and then to the side. The sequence closes with a brief releve.

COMMENTS:

I loved this very fun workout.  The exercises are more dance inspired as opposed to lotte berk inspired barre.  The pace was nice - mild cardio.  It is fast paced, but not as frantic as P57 so easy to keep up with her.  This DVD is quite a bit different than my other barre DVDs - Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre is probably the closest comparison.  I liked the balance work she included in various sections.

The only complaint I had was that the Play All option under Workout Options played the disclaimer, the Acacia page, her introduction, and the tutorial.  It was easy enough to chapter skip but would have been nice if they had an option for Play all Without Introduction as they do on some of the Core Fusion DVDs.",1297468800,345,4206,4.732876712328767
4314871,5,B004BBDHFO,"I LOVE this DVD!  I have tried both Pure Barre and The Bar Method and this is by far my favorite!  The other DVDs are great as far as toning goes, but this one I felt like has a much better cardiovascular workout along with toning.  I also love how the workout is broken up into sections: Warm up, Arms, Legs/seat, and Core, you can choose individual workouts or do the whole thing.  Andrea is a great instructor, gives great ques, and not too peppy.  I love this work out!",1297036800,79,473,4.211111111111111

4314874,4,B004BBDHFO,"Let me begin by saying that I am not sedentary!  I ride a bike 5 miles a day, walk for 2, and do Jillian Michaels' 6 week 6 pack three times a week. I bought this video for a little variety to my workout.

It. Was. HARD.  I made it halfway through before I had to take a break.  This makes me happy because it's a great workout (I can really feel it in my butt and lower belly!) but if you don't work out at all, this is not the place to start. If you already work out pretty hard, you'll probably like this a lot as something new and soothing while still providing a good workout!",1473724800,4,581,3.8983050847457625

4314886,5,B004BBDHFO,I love this workout. Had never done barre before but needed to do something for toning at home.  This video is difficult but fun and makes me feel great - tight and chiseled. I wish the creator - Andrea Rogers - had more videos for purcahse.,1455148800,,241,4.239130434782608

4314888,5,B004BBDHFO,"This has been a great fun addition to working out for both my daughter and I. She is a dancer so we already had a ballete bar in the house, though you can use a chair. Andrea is a fun person to wake up with and get moving in the morning.",1454198400,,237,3.6666666666666665
4314889,5,B004BBDHFO,"Andrea does not waste your time and that's one of my favorite things about this workout. She moves quickly to the next workout--no standing around for two minutes while she demonstrates. The workout is fun but really challenging. This was my first barre workout so I was a little sloppy, but there is a lot of motivation to improve. I can't imagine the results if I keep with this workout! I usually go to classes at the gym for P90X, HIIT, or Piyo, so I thought this would be easy, but I was wrong. It got me moving and I love the targeted movements. I also love that this is on Amazon Prime Video so I didn't have to buy the DVD. Also have to mention that I appreciate how the instructors' attire is not skimpy. It's nice to workout around my young sons and not have to worry about them peeking in and seeing half naked ladies! Bravo!",1453075200,,836,4.264150943396227
4314890,4,B004BBDHFO,Very similar barre workout routine to what I am used to at the gym.  I wish she has different and slower movement in this routine.,1449100800,,130,4.2

4314894,5,B004BBDHFO,I love the workout! It gets my heart pumping and blood rushing. They show you how to do different levels. Instructions clear and easy to follow. The music is just fast tempo techno. Suit the purpose. The only shortcoming in my opinion is that the warm up and cool down exercise are a little short.,1444521600,,297,4.418181818181818
4314895,5,B004BBDHFO,"I'm a stay home mom and I wanted to start working out again after having my son. A friend told me about Xtend Barre and I was interested in trying something new. So I got a groupon for an unlimited month access to the Xtend barre near me and I loved it. A Total body work out that slims and tones, just what I wanted. Mostly I've done yoga but barre has a flow I like which combines yoga and Pilate. So it's the best work out for me. Unfortunately I couldn't afford the $120 monthly membership. I was so happy when I saw this video I purchased it right away. This video is great work out that I can do at home while my baby's taking a nap. Wish there were more videos available with different routines like the actual classes offer but still great video. I liked that it  went over the terminology they use during the workout first so you understand what they are saying when they use some of those dance terms. I picked up on the terms in the class but for those trying it out for the first time it's helpful. I actually just received the video today, it came real fast, but I was so excited that I popped in the dvd right away and started the exercise! It was a good work out for home barre!",1442966400,3,1193,4.098290598290598
4314896,3,B004BBDHFO,"Audio quality is terrible. Great workout, though. Expect to have to practice the transitions before doing this one without breaks, as she moves fast enough to cause injury on a beginner. Once you've gotten a handle on form, though, it's a fun, fast workout that burns in the best way.",1442966400,3,284,4.7
4314897,4,B004BBDHFO,"Not exactly what I expected, but not bad. You will need a basic understanding of some Ballet terms, as they are use within the DVD.",1437868800,,131,4.28
4314898,5,B004BBDHFO,This is a great workout at home. I do not have an Xtend barre where I live so this is my only access to this method. I would recommend having some in studio barre training to get the most out of this at home workout.,1437091200,3,216,3.8222222222222224

4314900,5,B004BBDHFO,My legs my butt and even my abs have never looked better.  I was a ballet dancer for 33 years and this program helped me get my ballerina body back.  It's a very easy work out that gets great results,1434067200,9,199,3.95

4314907,4,B004BBDHFO,I had borrowed this video out of the library first and really enjoyed it.  I'm not much of an exercise class/gym person so I really enjoy finding videos I like.  I know nothing about barre so I can't speak to how it compares to other barre workouts.  I was looking for a good lower body workout and this definitely provides it.  I also find it a good way to work on flexibility and balance.  I liked that the moves aren't difficult to learn and are fairly small movements but you can definitely feel it both while holding the moves/doing the movements as well as the next day!  There are different sections witin the video and I like the barre portion the best.  I don't use the upper body section often as I have another video that I prefer the upper body section in better.,1424304000,3,775,4.340277777777778
4314908,5,B004BBDHFO,"The workout is a favorite -- it delivers what it promises and is a full body workout. My dancer daughter uses it as a supplement to her strength training and it is intensive enough to work her out, but I followed along also. The demonstrators shows the different levels from advanced to beginner and everyone can get a good workout. Andrea was very easy to follow and she gave simple and not overdone encouragement. It really gets to all parts of the body including the arms (they encourage light weights) and the abs. The legs portion of this video is what really makes it -- it used barre exercises and really works the butt and the inner and outer thighs. There are a few places where you can make it higher impact -- but regardless and no matter what level you are -- you can develop a good sweat by the end. Highly recommend this video for ALL levels!",1423440000,,856,4.389937106918239
4314909,5,B004BBDHFO,"All the good stuff the other reviewers say is true. Nice soft-tissue-friendly toning workout that nevertheless gets your blood flowing. Vary intensity of moves to make this workout easier or harder depending on ability/mood.

The moves don't take up a lot of space. It's not one of those cardio workouts where you're dancing/bouncing/clomping side to side over a swath of ground (and bumping into furniture or a cat). You pretty much stay put in an area about the size of a twin bed, and the cardio comes from moving your limbs while standing on one or two legs; there are some exceptions, of course, but most of the workout is grounded. So it's good not only for small spaces, but also for times you're staying in a hotel, and you don't want to be galloping across floorboards, disturbing close neighbors with weird workout noises.",1423180800,8,832,4.777777777777778

4314912,5,B004BBDHFO,"WOW!!!  I have been looking for this workout for years, but I just did not know it!  I have always found working out in my home by video the way to go.  I have joined many gyms over the years but I simply find I cannot be consistent with staying with them.  I have found that Pilates is probably my best bet for seeing results and not injuring myself.  This workout is arobic with Pilates and bit of barre. The instructor is clear, easy to understand and know matter where you rate your level, you will have one of the 3 exercisors to follow.  I love finding a workout that is challenging, but have no fear I will finish to the end.  I am excited to add this to my rotation of workouts and I have no doubt I will see improvement in strength and stamina! Just so glad I took a chance and ordered!

In all, this is a fantastic total body routine, and it DOES produce results.",1416009600,,425,4.756756756756757

Andrea Rogers gives clear instructions, and her voice is pleasant to listen to. There is one background dancer that has beautiful form, that advanced dancers could watch and learn from. There is also a background dancer that shows the modified version, and it is helpful. This video feels like being in a barre or ballet class that makes you break a sweat.
The instructor begins the video showing the basic ballet positions, so that you can have correct form during the video. Glad I got this one!",1413676800,2,684,4.756302521008403
4314919,5,B004BBDHFO,I REALLY like this DVD! I've taken barre classes in the past couple years and it can get pricey. I wanted to save money and continue to tone. This is great for what I need. I did purchase another even more difficult ballet floor exercise video as well to push me even further because I can already tell this one my body will get used to quickly. Lean & Chiseled is not advance ballet barre but it will challenge you. Especially the abs...yay! Get this DVD!,1412380800,,456,4.313953488372093
4314920,2,B004BBDHFO,"Like others on here, I felt the quality of the DVD itself was lacking.  I also did not like the very fast pace at which she does the movements.  I have several of Tracey Mallett's Barre DVD's, and while hers are also quick paced, they are attainable.  I ended up developing my own pace at which to do the movements so as not to injure myself.  A slower, focused pace would definitely have made the DVD more enjoyable.",1410480000,3,417,4.3076923076923075

I was a swimmer when I was young! I have Hashimoto's and low thyroid. And the super high intensity was it good for my body it was doing actually more harm then good. So I needed to tone it down but still wanted to find something that would strengthen me and tone me! I did the video and I sweat!! I didn't use any weights like suggested but next time I will. My butt and legs were sore the next day and still today, two days later I feel it! I would like to get more a long, sleek, toned figure again and I hoping this will help! We also moved back to our ranch way out in the country so the nearest gym is 20 miles away!

The videos reminded me A LOT of my pure barre classes I used to pay a fortune to go to!
I love how the background girls complete the class on different levels so you can pick which one best fits your activity level!
The music in the background is nothing special, but Andrea does a great job keeping your attention and keeping you focused on perfecting your moves!!! I recommend to everyone!",1402963200,,430,4.5256410256410255
4314934,5,B004BBDHFO,"This video is great for toning if you like high reps with no or low weight. Many of the moves make you feel very beautiful and graceful, which I love. There's a light cardio element too. If you're an avid runner, your heart rate probably won't skyrocket, but if you're a light to moderate exerciser, you'll feel your breath and it'll get your heart rate up to a comfortable fat-burning zone (no HIIT here!)

I love Andrea's cueing. You don't feel  like a fish flopping out of water the first few times you do the routine, which is great! She also constantly reminds you to pull your tummy in, tight/lifted core, etc, which is absolutely essential to getting the most out of the work out.

If you're a true-blue beginner, you might find some of the segments hard to keep up with. That's fine, because she always demonstrates a slower version of the move before going ""all out,"" and I think you'd be fine keeping with the slower pace.

For most of us (moderate exercisers), it's going to be a great choice. Many of the moves are easy to do, yet there are some that are very challenging and will have to be something you work up to - which is nice in a video. If you can do all the moves all at once, it's very boring very quickly.

I've been combining this with Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful a few times a week and I must say, I am looking much more toned and standing taller. The biggest difference has been in my posture and my arms look really nice. All in all, I highly recommend this work out for days you have 55 minutes to set aside and dedicate to your body.",1402617600,,1570,4.308474576271187

Andrea has some really good toning elements-especially abs and upper body (although, don't get me wrong-it does work your lower body, too, I just miss the upper body stuff). This is a good overall body workout and a good barre workout. It's not the ""Insanity"" workout, but you're heart rate will go up and you will sweat! Enjoy!",1402012800,2,468,4.517647058823529

Tough as in...you realize how weak you are until you do some of these Arm and Leg exercises. Whenever I do this dvd...I feel like I sweated off like 5 lbs. Some people find it boring because she doesn't do anything fast..BUT that's what makes the exercises effective, b/c you are slowly focusing on those inner muscles..and you are challenging your strength by holding and lifting your upper weight up with the arms. Trust me..I've done the non boring..and it makes me not want to do the h.i.t. everyday or even every other day. This dvd is perfect b/c you can do it like once a week.. and take breaks..and gradually get stronger..and it'll get easier..and you'll get leaner. I've noticed a difference in my arms. Andrea's so tiny..but when you do the leg exercises and even holding your arms up and around for awhile you realize how strong she is! For women this is great because it makes you tinier..but in reality you are gaining strength without putting on the strength look. I was one of the lucky customers who DID receive this right away in the mail.

I do pure barre classes which are as challenging but in a different way, this DVD has more cardio and changing of positions than a barre class where you are holding the same small move for an excruciatingly (wonderful?) long time. This video will get you sweaty and gives you a better arm workout than traditional barre classes and while your legs will probably shake they won't shake as much as a barre class. But I love this video it works up a great sweat and hits arms (with 3 pound weigh section) legs, seat and abs plus a cool down. Great 55 minute workout.

4314946,5,B004BBDHFO,"Im on a barre kick these days. This is from a person who loves heavy weight training and intense cardio.  Ive done several rounds of Beachbodys P90X, Insanity and Asylum.  Ive also completed several rounds of Cathe Friedrichs STS series.

In an effort to mix things up, Im not doing barre and yoga pretty much exclusively.  I was excited to come across this Lean & Chiseled workout.  I love the combination of dance, sculpting and Pilates!  I feel so graceful doing this type of workout.  Okay, so maybe I don't so graceful, but its what is inside that counts, right?

Why I love this workout:

* Its deceptively intense.  When I started, Im thinking, how hard can a workout be that uses 3 pound hand weights?  Boy was I wrong!  About halfway through the arm section, I was dropping to no weights.  My muscles were screaming!

* The cardio factor.  I love how my heart rate gets elevated.  No, its not like an Insanity workout, where your heart rate is through the roof for the entire workout, but its just enough to feel your breath.

* The modifiers.  One is doing an easier version of the exercises and the other was doing a more advanced version.  As much as I like to think that Im an advanced exerciser, I was following the easier modifier.

* The workout versatility.  You can do all three segments for a 55 minute workout, or you can pick and choose to do Upper Body, Barre and Core separately.

* The tutorial.  It is especially important with barre to get your form perfect.  This is hard to do without being in front of a live instructor.  In the tutorial section, Andrea does a great job of explaining the correct form.

There are a few things to note about this workout.  They didn't bother me because I was enjoying the workout so much, but I felt they were worth mentioning.  The things to note are:

* The very plain, white set background.  I was glad for no distractions, but it was plain.

* The plastic chairs for the barre section.  The chairs were the oddest looking chairs I have ever seen; they were clear plastic.

I have knee and back problems and I was able to safely do the work out.  I was not able to do the full work out for the first 2 days that I have had the video.

4314952,3,B004BBDHFO,"I'm surprised other reviewers did not comment on the set of this video.  For me, it was very distracting with pink & purple lighting in an auditorium that distinctly reminded me of a 80s prom venue, complete with emergency exit.  Including the too fast cheesy music!  The topper was when the three matching (down to their socks) instructors pull out clear plastic chairs, presumably off the set of Wonder Woman.  I couldn't get past it.  I GREATLY prefer a normal gym studio setting with natural lighting (a la Jill Dailey, Sadie Lincoln, or Tracy Anderson).

I gave 3 stars because this work-out was OK, if unoriginal.  If you actually do the whole video, it's a decent work-out.  Andrea is a cheerleader: ""Doing Great!  Feel the burn!  Woo hoo!""  but after doing a hundred videos, I prefer an instructor that just talks to you like a regular person (s.a. all the instructors at Barre 3). She also refers to squats as plies, which is disorienting if you are familiar with ballet.  However, if you enjoyed the Jane Fonda videos of the 80s, you will probably enjoy this one as an updated blast-from-the-past.

I ended up buying the video from Amazon and still do it at least 3 times a week. My body feels better than ever.
I think Andrea Rogers is fantastic as a teacher. She never gets annoying like some other videos I have. She is always positive during the work out and I love how she constantly reminds you to keep the ""proud chest"". I would highly recommend this video for intermediate workouts.

4314970,5,B004BBDHFO,"Andrea developed a nice barre routine together with some ballet inspired cardio exercises that will tone and lengthen your muscles. Sometimes it is a bit fast to raise your cardio levels, but the main focus is toning (arms, legs and abs). The combinations of exercises are neatly organized and after some tough toning there is always some stretching to elongate your muscles.

Although this DVD has a workout format (a series of repetitions of the same exercise), it is not boring, maybe because of the music selection, but it is not fun either: this is a workout, not a dance based fitness DVD. This is not one of the DVD's I ""choose"" willingly. I always have to push myself to start it, because I know it will be tough, but once I start it, it's ok. With this workout you will achieve a ""dancer's"" body, strong toned elongated muscles, not really like when you do weight lifting, but definitely toned and healthy. Your posture improves and you feel taller.

SAFETY
I would say normal precautions are enough, I have a knee injury and I am ok with this DVD. I would only say that special attention needs to be placed on how you perform the exercises when the tempo is increased, since sometimes the speed makes us sloppy and the knee could be injured.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Very good CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: None INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Not really fun, it's hard work, but the music selection is good, so it's ok.

CONTENTS:
- Warm-up (10 Min.)
- Arms toning: Mostly with light handweights, the exercises are very varied for different arm and shoulder muscles. This section is very effective, my arms showed nice muscles after just a couple of weeks (11 Min.)
- Legs toning: You will use a chair as a barre - this part is the toughest also in terms of cardio (23 Min.)
- Abs toning: You will need a mat, since this section is mainly dedicated to crunches. However the abs are also exercised in the first two standing arm and leg segments (10 Min.)
- Stretches (6 Min.)

MUSIC:
Good pop and latin music selection.

EMPHASIS:
Very good overall emphasis, cardio, strength, stretch. You tone legs, arms, shoulders and abs (core)... It also includes several balance and flexibility exercises, which I always find very good and you also have some cardio. The DVD is best performed barefoot.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Excellent overall emphasis: This workout tones several key areas
+ Tough toning mostly with your own weight, the combinations are effective
+ Simplicity: It can be done by almost anybody, since the exercises are not complicated. The reps are tough, but not the exercises themselves.
+ After each toning exercise (not after the full segment, but after some specific exercises) there is some stretching for that specific muscle.",1375401600,2,2801,4.786749482401656

4314972,5,B004BBDHFO,"Hi all!  I'm a 26 year old that took ballet for 18 years, quit for 6, and returned to it last August.  In that one dance season, I lost 30lbs just from Ballet 2 hours a week!  I even performed several numbers in the spring recital, and returned to pointe as well!  It was great season and I really transformed my body.

After the June recital, I learned that my studio would not be offering summer classes.  I tried a few other studios and didn't like any of them much, so I decided to see what was on the market to use at home.  I've got a barre in my house, so a barre class was my first choice when I realized formal ballet dvd's were pretty rare.

I bought this today, and it was great.  It is structured similarly to my standard ballet classes, but with much less actual ballet moves.  The moves presented in the video will be challenging for absolute beginners, but this is how ballet class is too-- it's not easy at all!  Even understanding the moves there were still things that made my legs and stomach burn.  I struggle with my core strength after having one child, so this dvd was perfect for me.  Ballet is all about core strength and balance, and this video sure delivers!  I was dripping in sweat after the warmup.

Even though it's not 100% ballet, it still made me sweat and made my legs tremble.  I think this is a great video to use during my off time from class, even for the core moves alone!  I do wonder how many non-dancers will hurt themselves doing this, ballet is strict about alignment, and standing weird during some of these moves can cause injury, particularly the arabesques.  Focus on keeping your hips square and not raising the hip of the leg that's doing the movements.

Ballet really is a crazy good workout.  It combines cardio, strength, and balance.  You will lose weight taking ballet or doing ballet style moves, I did, but it was a gradual thing.  I went down 2 pant sizes, but my actual weight on the scale stayed the same after awhile.  It's because you are building a lot of fat burning muscle when you do these moves.

4314978,5,B004BBDHFO,"I thought Xtend Barre: Lean and Chiseled was AWESOME.  It felt like it was a ballet dancer's workout video. My Jillian Michaels video's do not shine a light to this one.  It truly gave me a fantastic workout and it kept ballet and dance elements throughout the whole workout. The movements were not your typical workout moves,which was very refreshing.  By the end of it, I was very glad I decided to start  getting some conditioning because I learned that I am severely out of shape. At several points, I had to modify the exercises by stopping or just doing some demi-plies or tendu's to give myself a breather. I got a very thorough workout without any high impact movements. I need to be able to strengthen my ankles and feet for ballet class and this workout will certainly be helping.

Ok, so I admit it, I was sweating by the end of the upper body workout..shhh....  So, I really did get what I was asking for in this workout!

Here is a breakdown of the whole thing...

The workout is a total of 55 minutes long.  You can do the whole workout from beginning to end or you can choose which segments you want to do that day.  I like that a lot.  At this point, I need to break it up until I have gotten in better shape and can do it all from start to finish at once. Below is the order of the workout:

Warm-Up (Great!)
Upper Body (Seriously, this will make you sweat)
Barre ( Very good, almost felt like a ballet class)
Core (Not your average crunches)
Cool-down (Just ok)

The only cons I have for this workout is the music is a little cheesy rumba-zumba like.  It truly would be better with some classical music but that is just my preference.  I didn't really like the cool down either.  It was too fast paced.  I did some of their stretches and I ended up doing my own slow stretches for about 20 minutes to work in time on increasing my flexibility.  They do some stretching at certain points during the barre section of the workout, which I liked.  Trust me, you will need them at those points!

In conclusion, if you are looking for a good workout to compliment your dance class or want just a ballet-esque workout Xtend Barre: Lean and Chiseled is a good one to do!",1372809600,3,2180,4.322660098522167
4314979,4,B004BBDHFO,Not as hard as I expected but still good. I'm a Cathe Fiedriche fan so its hard to get one as hard and effective as her cardio barre. Still recommend for mid level or intermediate exerciser.,1372550400,,190,4.305555555555555
4314980,5,B004BBDHFO,"Xtend Barre is a really fun workout! I have noticed that my legs and arms are now becoming a lot more toned and its only been 2 weeks! its an hour but it doesn't seem that long because you have to really concentrate on your form while working out..I also like the fact that you can continue to challenge yourself with this workout. They show an example for beginners, and advanced, so you can work your way up.",1371340800,,410,4.269230769230769

The workout will make you sweat, and curse at Andrea. How can she smile through the whole thing?
After about two months, at twice a week, my butt's perkier and my arms are getting some nice definition.
I still haven't mastered the entire core sequence though!
I recommend it.",1370908800,,420,4.3164556962025316

4314983,4,B004BBDHFO,"I do a lot of barre workouts and attend a barre class regularly. I was looking for something extra to do at home so I tried this DVD. It's really good, not very intense but still a good workout. It includes some cardio which I really like.",1369699200,,239,4.1063829787234045
4314984,5,B004BBDHFO,"I rate this 5 stars because it is exactly what i was hoping it would be. I love doing yoga and i wanted something a little more faster paced and targeted at conditioning my muscles and toning my body. This is a fantastic DVD and i highly recommend it if what you are after is a solid flowing pilates/xtend barre workout at home. I have to admit, i am in a sweat by the time the warm up session is done and my legs are like jelly after the barre work out. All you need is a chair and some space to be kicking your leg forwards and also lunging backwards. I also like how you can adjust the work out for either a beginner (...or for lazy days) or if you are a little more advanced (for days where you might be feeling progressive and enegertic), at the moment i have been doing the arms session without the weights (and my arms still get a good workout and feel sore in the days afterwards), but if you wanna amp it up she suggests using 1kg of 1.5kg weights (you can also just use full water bottles or cans of soup - the joys of saving money by working out at home!). Whilst i haven't been to an xtend barre class, because they all seem to be held in city/metro areas, after doing this DVD i would feel confident attending a class for the first time after practicing this work out at home.

It's also good to see the trainers/models have somewhat strained smiles on their faces as well as wobbling every now throughout the routine. I have been doing this DVD once a week for the past month and am hoping to do it a couple of times a week now that i am not so sore in the days afterwards, and it has added something different to my usual routine of yoga and walking. I can't comment on results as it's too soon, but i can certainly feel certain parts of my body working in ways that i can't when doing yoga or when walking. I hope she releases another xtend barre DVD in the future!",1368662400,,1881,4.111413043478261

Granted there is not a whole lot of cardio in it which is okay as I am doing this at home and don't want the room stinking like a gym.  I always wanted to learn ballet but never did.

Good direction is given for the steps and exercises, but it gets very fast to provide cardio and I am doing it at my own pace, slower. I feel I can work up to the faster pace, but the exercises are still good done slowly. I like the format with a warm-up, a cool down and the three options of exercises for upper body, leg and hips (barre), and core. It makes it possible to do a workout that includes the whole body or to choose to do one section at a time. Having done ballet growing up, these exercises are fun for me and helpful.",1360627200,,599,4.128205128205129
4314995,4,B004BBDHFO,"This one took me a few times to get used to its quick pace. Once I did the routine a few times, I could then begin to anticipate the next move. If you look at my other reviews for barre related videos, the ones with 5 stars are the ones in which are perfect (for me personally) due to both the instuctor's explanation and overall style.
On a more positive note, this exercise routine does have a few new ballet/other moves that are not on other barre/ballet DVD'S, and that is a plus for me!
This will be one of those exercise DVD's I will have to be in the mood for; still, it's a decent workout!",1360281600,,597,4.111111111111111

4315007,4,B004BBDHFO,"For over a year I have attended Pure Barre classes at the local studio which are very expensive.  Very effective, but very expensive.  I set out to find a barre DVD I could use to save some cash but still get a great workout.  The Pure Barre brand DVDs didn't get rave reviews so I thought I'd check out Xtend Barre based on the positive reviews.  Compared to Pure Barre, this is slightly less difficult but I think it will still get you decent results.  I thought it was more challenging than the Bar Method Accelerated Workout by Burr Leonard.  You don't need any special equipment other than a pair of light dumbbells, which you can buy on Amazon for about five bucks.  The best part of the workout, in my opinion, was the upper body part.  I thought I had pretty decent upper body strength but this made me feel like a weakling.  It does get some good cardio in, but not enough to replace a run or a workout on the elliptical.  I'm getting a BodyMedia FIT armband this week so I'm curious to see what kind of calorie burn you really get from this workout.  I will post my results when I have them! As far as the lower body, I was slightly disappointed by the intensity-- I didn't get the shaking legs like I do in a Pure Barre class.  I guess I'll just have to figure out some ways to ramp it up on my own.  All in all I think this is a great workout for someone inexperienced in barre workouts, but a die-hard ""barre-bie"" will likely get something out of it too.",1358640000,5,1467,4.21505376344086

Just in case you're wondering whether my eating habits are the problem rather than this DVD, I am eating the same as I was when I used a more effective Body by Jake DVD. My concern that I wasn't burning many calories during this workout were confirmed when I input my weight and the duration of my workout in the Everyday Health website's Calorie Burn Calculator.

This video was actually pretty great.  The content of the video is challenging but not unreasonably so.  I just had a baby, complete with a unscheduled c-section.  (YAY!)  Prior to my pregnancy, I was in good but not tip-top condition.  I am now trying to work my way back to where I started.

One of the great things about this video is the modifications.  Right now, I can do the easier modification of all the moves.  (This is preferable to just collapsing into ""Beached Whale Pose."")  However, as I get stronger, there is definitely room to grow.

If I had one complaint (and I do, hence the 4 stars) it is about the digital format.  On Roku, you cannot skip through the sections.  I would think you can on the DVD.

Overall, this is worth purchasing if you want a good barre workout.",1347926400,,979,4.446327683615819
4315037,5,B004BBDHFO,"xtend barre is a great full body workout that gets to work out all parts of my body.  I feel the effects on my upper body, legs and abs.  it also has a great physical component so you get a lot of cardio in.  the instructor does a nice job of giving explanations of dance terminology, but works the references in slowly throughout the workout so that it isn't too hard for a someone without a dance background, like myself, to follow.  she also has two others with her doing the routines in either advanced or modified versions, the instruction is clear and motivational without being annoying.  i use this routine throughout the week in my rotation and definitely recommend it.",1347667200,,678,4.570247933884297

Xtend Barre is now incorporated into my routine each week because it's such a good combination of cardio/stretching/and toning muscle.  I just tried it out today and all I can say is ""wow"".  I started to sweat during the warm up and my thighs were burning!  I recommend this to anyone who can't do impact exercises since this is so good on the joints and lengthens muscle.  I suffer from a chronic hip and back injury and this helps me get in the cardio without hurting myself.  At first, I felt like an idiot because I know nothing about ballet, but once you do the moves over and over again, the form will develop. Buy this DVD!",1347667200,,744,4.514925373134329

I decided to buy this video after hearing about barre classes and how they are great for core strength. I also wanted to mix up my workouts as well. I did my first set of workouts with this dvd last Wed. I only did the warm up and barre segments. OMG! They are REALLY hard. My booty cheeks were on FIRE by the end. Be sure that you stretch well before and after the video. I will keep on trying it if I can look half as sleek and toned as the instructor :),1345939200,2,611,3.78125

Because plis or reverences are NOT supposed to be fast-paced, it doesn't allow you to concentrate on your form and while trying to keep up, you naturally shift you position and harm yourself. I will not use this DVD again.

4315045,4,B004BBDHFO,"I don't review very often, but since I have made many purchases on here weighting heavily on reviews, I'm going to start.

I have had this DVD for a few months now, and I did it about once a week.  I am pretty fit already but have stopped going to the gym, so I rely on videos most of the time for fitness.  I've attended Bar Method classes and also have Bar Method and Core Fusion DVDs, so I was already familiar with the type of ""dancer's"" workout I'd be getting here.

The first time I tried this DVD, I thought the pace was unreasonable.  I should have watched it through once beforehand, so I highly recommend that you do.  The workout is about 45 minutes if you skip the intro and warm-up (which I don't find useful beyond the first time) -- 11 minutes upper body, 23 minutes thighs butt, and 10 minutes core.

The upper body segment isn't easy for me, but probably because I lack upper body strength.  You will probably fatigue, though, if you are following the correct form.  The ""barre"" section requires a chair or counter and a little space to move around.  I find this section to be tedious at times, but probably because I've done it so many times.  I do feel that the moves are pretty effective IF you do them correctly.  I know when I'm doing the moves correctly and challenging myself enough if my legs start shaking occasionally.  You can make it harder for yourself by doing the advanced modifications (jumping) or getting lower in the positions.

The bore section is only difficult at one point, when you don't get a break between one side and the next (especially if you are doing the advanced modifications).  Otherwise, I don't find it that hard, but I have done a lot of this type of ab work in the past so I could just be used to it.

As for the music, I don't mind it -- it kind of reminds me of Captain Jack at some points and is a little electronica-ish.  Andrea is not annoying... kind of girlie and peppy, but motivating enough.  I have a more detailed review on my blog if you want to know more... you can search for the title of this DVD and ""A Case of the Runs.""",1338249600,,2093,4.282442748091603

4315047,4,B004BBDHFO,LOVE this workout but the music is migraine inducing. Another review mentioned manic and that is spot on. I would expect the music to be fluid and flowing like the moves but it's nightclub-esque however without the melodies....mostly just frantic high pitched beats. Doesn't fit the workout in my opinion. I guess it's good I can turn the volume off:( . Otherwise a great product!,1337126400,,380,4.861538461538461
4315048,5,B004BBDHFO,"I purchased this DVD at Target after reading reviews here on Amazon (I didn't want to wait for it to be shipped!). The reason I was drawn to this particular DVD is because I wanted something that was fast paced to get my heart pumping, but was dance inspired for toning. I am by no means a dancer and have never taken a dance class in my life. However, I ordered the Piloxing DVD by Viveca Jensen a few months ago and it combines pilates, ballet moves and boxing and I absolutely fell in love with it. The ballet dance inspired moves on that DVD leave me feeling sleek and toned without being achey. The stretching and toning moves combined together are perfect for me since I have a ""bad"" knee and am not looking to bulk up, but to slim/tone down. I am 230lbs at 5'10. I am not a small woman. This particular DVD was challenging due to the speed of the moves, but not overwhelmingly so. I was dripping sweat by the end of the lower body segment and my legs were definitely shakey. I had a lot of trouble with the abs section since I am not in excellent shape and have never really targeted my abs before. I simply did what I could and tried to do my best with the movements that were more difficult/unfamiliar. The first time doing this DVD I made it through over 42 minutes. I did not incorporate the jumping moves as the advanced example did, but also did not have to do all of the moves as the easy modifier did. The day after I was not very sore/ achey, but could definitely feel that I had worked my muscles (if that makes sense). I have done Supreme 90 day and other more intense training programs and they always leave me extremely sore and wiped out. Having a busy lifestyle, I don't have the option of constantly feeling drained and hurting when I move, but I still want to have some muscle tone! Putting the extra effort in is what does the trick for me with this DVD. When my legs start to shake I push through. I try to do every move as deep as I possibly can. I feel that there are just enough repetitions of each of the moves so that I can make it through them and have a slight recovery (though it did get difficult at the end of the lower body segment). All in all, I loved this DVD and am definitely incorporating it into my weekly workout routine.",1335830400,,2266,4.1995412844036695

4315050,5,B004BBDHFO,"I am hooked on Yoga/pilates/dance dvds, but few get my heart rate up there like this one (note: I did not take all of ""jumping"" options, so there is room for me to grow into this, excellent!).  Although there is a woman modeling an ""easier"" modification of the workout, i find that this DVD is geared to an intermediate exerciser--pacing is quick and high-energy.  If you have NYCBworkout, Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body workout, or perhaps others like these but are looking for a new challenge, this is the DVD for you.  I sent back the DVD ""Cardiobarre"" because it failed to effectively do what ""Xtend Barre"" does: offer an aerobic barre workout that will not tear your ACL.

Pros- Creative and challenging blend of pilates and ballet-inspired exercises.  The music did not bother me a bit!  No boredom here.  The instructor guides you smoothly from set to set before any workout ADD has a chance to set in.

Cons-  The Arms section is a bit more like the ""triceps section"" neglecting a good many of your upper body muscles.  The Abdominal section might be tricky for those who have not practiced any pilates, regardless of his/her fitness level.

A note-  Put those heels down if you feel your runner's bunions' acting up!  O yes, my fellow funny-footed friends who pound the pavement, i'm there with you--love the toning benefits of releve, hate the way the bunions poke out when i get up on my toes.

4315052,2,B004BBDHFO,"I purchased this because the description sounded so wonderful because it combined Pilates and dance and I love both.  I loved the movements in this DVD, however the pace seemed very fast and Pilates is not fast.  Pilates is about control and it is very difficult to have control when the movements are at double time unless of course you are an advanced athlete like the women on the DVD.  Unfortunately, nowhere on this DVD does it mention that it is for advanced athletic Pilates and dance achievers. My other issue was with the annoying drum beat of music that pulsates throughout the entire DVD.  I would have really loved this DVD if the same movements were done at a slower pace and with better music.  On the positive side, the stretches and ab work were great.  I would love to see Andrea come out with a less advanced version for beginners utilizing stretch, lengthening and strengthening at a much slower pace which would be more targeted to beginners and moderate athletes.

It's also not time consuming if you break up the segments such as doing the total body three days a week and the arms and abs two days a week.

This workout is very fast-paced. It says it can be modified for beginners, but as a beginner I know I struggled. By the end of the barre portion I was dripping with sweat and shaking every time I tried to do something different. I simply did not have enough 'oomph' to finish it out.
With that said...
This is a great workout! It may not be ideal for someone like me to start with (remember, it's VERY fast-paced), but I know I got a lot of work in and I'm ready to see how much better I can get at it.

After my first work out; which was the warm up, then the 20 minute Barre; my legs didn't get soar until the next 12 hours, and the soarness increased until I decided to do abit more later on that night. I really enjoy the difference in min&ugrave;te movement, but yet great sweat provoking toning.

I will follow-up a few months from now with the results of my new adventure in Ballet toning; if there are any. I will try to be consistant with it so I can give an honest review.",1327795200,3,773,4.368055555555555
4315060,5,B004BBDHFO,"I am a person who has always loved to dance but has very little actual ballet experience.  Always wanted to take ballet; was told I was too ""hippy"" for ballet when I was younger and pretty much gave up on the idea after that and took up tap and, eventually, bellydancing.

My point in saying all that is to demonstrate that someone with very little ballet experience could probably get this video and still do okay with it - though having some fundamental instruction would be very helpful, especially where turnout is concerned.  Very important to have turnout from the hips and not the knees; I can foresee inexperienced folks torquing out knees if they're not careful in paying attention to form.  As with any exercise program, correct form is KEY to preventing injury.

This workout is CHALLENGING.  Read the other reviews, and take them to heart.  There are modifications to some of the more challenging moves, which is a very good thing.  Doing the modified moves will still sufficiently challenge you until you are ready to try upping your level a bit.

The instructor, Andrea, is obviously a dancer and probably a dance teacher.  Her cues are very clear and her communication in general is very good when she describes exercise form - and it's good that she basically acknowledges every time something is difficult and the muscles are burning!  At first, I thought, ""Holy WOW, this lady is happy and chipper and NUTS!"" - but dancers are used to smiling despite the intensity of what they're doing, so I chalk it up to that.  :)

It is very proactive and the exercises are simple as well, which is what I enjoy the most. I'm pretty sure that if I was more disciplined there would be physical changes on my body, but so far I only do it for fun, and there is no gymn that can make me feel the same so far.",1322870400,,713,3.857142857142857
4315067,4,B004BBDHFO,"Xtend Barre Lean & Chiseled was (and is) something entirely new for me, a style of exercise I have never attempted before. So for that reason I thought it would be a useful new selection to alternate with other favorite exercise DVD's presently in ""heavy rotation"" in my basement workout space. (A few of which I've reviewed separately on Amazon.)

My reaction--I like it! But before I expand let me fill in some blanks.  Surely unlike 98% of the other users, I am male and probably also unlike many other Xtend Barre users, I'm well into middle age, having just turned the calendar on 54 years.  Though I would NOT call myself a ""gym rat"" I have certainly been a relentlessly faithful exercise devotee since age 25 when I realized to my alarm that metabolism alone would not keep me lean.  Decades of aerobics classes followed, regular ""land"" aerobics as well as step, along with various toning classes, and since '06 I've been wringing myself into a puddle of sweat at the company gym (stairclimber--NEVER gets easy), and at home exploring the under-appreciated wonderland of exercise DVD. In addition to conventional abs and toning workouts, I've diversified with yoga and pilates which have both proven to be challenging and beneficial.  So I think I can claim that I'm an experienced fitness person with some credibility.

So with that in mind, I want to observe first that ""Xtend Barre"" is NOT appropriate for beginners.  If you are only now getting off your sofa to begin your fitness quest, this is NOT the place to start.  I would classify Xtend Barre certainly as an intermediate (possibly advanced) level class which will very quickly intimidate and overwhelm a beginner.  Do NOT let this stop you--there are scores of DVD's targeted directly at beginners and you should have NO hesitation at starting at an appropriate level.  I promise a beginner program will quickly let you see improvement, however if you try to bite off ""Xtend Barre"" to start, your aspirations will quickly be dashed.

Trying something new in a fitness routine is NECESSARY but also humbling,  as ""Xtend Barre"" quickly reminded me. Because it's based on ballet stances and moves, the emphasis and orientation is considerably different from most  familiar aerobics routines.  BALANCE, control and precision are required here to a degree not demanded by other cardio/toning programs.  For those (like me) with no background in ballet it's a bit of a shock to see how clumsy and awkward my early attempts at this material were (and still are, though I AM acclimating). But here's the unassailable truth we must not flinch from: fitness (like life itself) demands that we be fearless in advancing ourselves; inertia and allowing ourselves to stick with the ""same old same old"" will lead us only to stagnation and decline.  NO I'll never make the US Olympic team, but neither can I be satisfied that grinding out 25 push ups every morning is sufficient to keep me fit as the years pile up. Beginners take heed!  Once your introductory workout starts to seem tolerable, you have to switch and challenge yourself anew!

Xtend Barre trainer Andrea Rogers is EXTREMELY competent in her cueing and (as we would expect) in her mastery of the material and her direction of the workout segments.  I especially admired how smoothly the barre section of the workout alternated sides of the body then added new moves to build and extend the routine. Throughout Andrea maintained steady cues and encouragement with changes vocally telegraphed in advance VERY effectively so home users can be ready for transitions without losing track.  Of course I also have to mention as someone who has been a male for a long time, Andrea and her raven-tressed workout partners (demonstrating the high and low intensity modifications) are all sleek beauties, and YES denounce me if you must but that's always an extra sprinkle of motivation for us XY gender users...

Again--this workout will challenge you, and here I redeploy my ironclad law of video workouts: you are NOT allowed to abandon any routine/instructor until you've done the entire workout four or five times. ANYTHING new you try--especially a higher level workout like Xtend Barre--is going to make unfamiliar and taxing demands on you.  Realize that this is part of the reason why you do it--and understand that you will need a few repetitions to ""get"" the instructors' style and material.  The blessing and curse of video workouts is that they're ALWAYS the same--over time you will learn the routine with some swagger, and then it's time to pick up something new.  Let me just admit here that I'll be working months to bring myself to that point of familiarity with ""Xtend Barre"".  Let me also point out that Andrea & her producers (mercifully and wisely I think) made the barre segment accessible by using a chair for balance throughout.  Clearly, Andrea and her helpers could do the routine with NO support; thankfully they understood that most of us will never gain that degree of mastery (though it's certainly something to shoot for over time), and chose to do the barre routine using chairs so we can keep ourselves vertical as they lead us through this demanding sequence.

""Sweat like a pig"" is an indelicate but accurate description of my experience running through the entire 50-some minutes of this routine.  You can certainly break it up and do one segment daily (the 23 minute barre routine is the longest-and most difficult).  I prefer to get the full routine in if possible, so my use so far has been confined (mostly) to weekends.  However in my short exposure so far, I feel I AM catching on and  indeed, following their demonstration with increased snap and vigor.

Of course the question is fairly asked: does ""Xtend Barre"" truly deliver the ""dancer's body you've always wanted"" (as the box claims)?  My direct answer is YES with the qualification that YOU are obliged to work it so it will work for you, AND recognize that one DVD workout alone can never span the entire continuum of what is necessary for optimal fitness and good looks.  Now let me hasten to add that NO, after only a months' (somewhat limited) use of Xtend Barre I do not have a ""dancer's body"".  Given my fitness background however I'm firm in my conviction that my years of work have been indisputably beneficial and exercise should be something EVERYONE with a body does.

I'm not going the full 5 stars for ""Xtend Barre"" because it's too high of a hill for beginners to climb, but exercise veterans looking for something adventurous and different should DEFINITELY add this to their library and rotation.

Amazon friends, there is NO silver bullet!  I like and recommend this DVD but be aware that it could be more than you can handle right now.  Let's not kid ourselves that establishing and maintaining a commitment to fitness is easy, ESPECIALLY if parenting, work, or possibly an unsympathetic spouse actively or passively try to discourage you.  You must not let those things get between your aspirations and actions. This after all is YOUR life!  As so many have sagely reminded us in other contexts, let's not die full of regrets for the things we were too timid to attempt.

4315068,5,B004BBDHFO,"I have done many barre workouts and Xtend Barre by far blew me away. Rogers kept me motivated throughout the entire video, there were times I wanted to give up but she keeps you moving. I feel a difference already and hope she comes out with more dvd's in the near future. I highly recommend Xtend Barre!",1317168000,2,304,4.350877192982456
4315069,5,B004BBDHFO,"I have been doing ""The Booty Barre"" workout by Tracey Mallet for a few months and I really like it, so I wanted to get another barre inspired workout for variety. I read the reviews and chose this one. After viewing this DVD for the first time I absolutely hated it. I couldn't keep up and felt rather defeated. But when I gave it another try a few days later, I changed my mind. I think I like it. It is very challenging and quite different from the other workout I mentioned. It does move rather quickly, but once you give it a go a few times, it becomes doable. My advice to those who hate it after the first try, give it and yourself another chance and work your way up to it. It's a toughie, but well worth the effort!",1315440000,5,723,4.098591549295775

4315072,4,B004BBDHFO,"When done correctly this is a great workout. I say correctly because if I had not taken previous dance classes (just some adult ballet) and known the correct placement of knees, hips etc...I don't think it would have affected me as much. I have friends that have never danced and it did make them sore but I didn't see them dripping sweat like me..haha...My only negative is that having taken some dance some of the movements are a little fast. I prefer to take them a little slower and do them correctly than speed them up just to say I kept up with her pace. Overall I think this is a great workout even if you have never taken dance before...especially if you aren't used to all those releves and arabesques!",1314144000,3,711,4.435114503816794
4315073,4,B004BBDHFO,"I really like this DVD. I don't use the arms or abs portion much (the abs section is ok but short, the arms don't seem particularly challenging). I mostly do the barre workout- it's quick (23 minutes) and challenging. I'm in decent shape and started taking some beginner ballet classes as an adult. I've tried the NYC Ballet workouts but they don't really feel strenuous enough to count as a real workout. I personally prefer this DVD. All you need is a chair and you can do it in a small space. You'll definitely feel the work in your butt/thighs and even calves while you're doing it. I did this workout consistently for a week or two and the next time i went to a ballet class I felt like I was defintely stronger doing some of the barre work. If you like the barre part of ballet and looking for a quick workout to use the same muscle groups you'll probably like this. There's SOME cardio in it, you'll probably break a sweat, but it's more of a cardio/strength fusion than an all-out cardio workout.",1313452800,3,1004,4.403225806451613
4315074,3,B004BBDHFO,"I did enjoy this dvd, but I feel like the ballet influence is very minimal. It is a very nice workout overall, and I would recommend this dvd to add to the fitness collection for your home workouts. Having done ballet for several years, I was hoping for more of a traditional barre feel, but it is really watered down. I would say it is a little more of a cardio-pilates vibe with a little barre influence thrown into the mix. You use a chair, and do a lot of generic plies in first and second position, some quasi arabesques and other mildly ballet moves. It would have been a nice touch to add some of the beautiful and graceful arm positions that can be done with barre work. But overall, I do use this dvd frequently and enjoy it as a nice workout on my more time constrained days. I like that you can pick and choose which workouts you want to do.
The workout clocks in at roughly 50 minutes if you skip the intro. It is composed of a warm-up, arm/upper body work, lower body work, abs, and a cool-down/stretch. There are two women doing variations: one doing more mild versions while the other performs the more high impact versions. The music is sort of like something you would hear on a Bally total fitness commercial, but is not too bad, and sometimes helps you get into the workout.
So overall I would suggest it. It can give you a good sweat, and is a convenient way to get some fitness in at home. I like that it incorporates strengthening and stretching- though you may want to pause it at moments so you can stretch longer than 8 seconds. If you are really looking for a ballet workout  DVD I would suggest the ballet boot camp 2- it is about the closest I have been able to find that is ALMOST like being in class.",1312502400,7,1730,4.274390243902439

I thought Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled would be a variation of this; it is not.  It is very fast paced with a lot of cardio right from the very beginning of the routine.  No instruction on range of motion or body positioning. If you're not up to that kind of strenuous speed, or not familiar with the correct moves, it seems to me that you could injure yourself pretty quickly.  This routine would just be another dust collector for me.",1311292800,18,579,4.476190476190476

4315078,5,B004BBDHFO,I really like how this dvd allows you to select just the section you want to work out such as upper body vs. core.  The entire workout took about 45 min skipping the introduction and cool down.  The ballet movements are great and its faster pace than boring pilates.  I use this in addition to my 30 day Shed with Jillian Michaels.  I think combining these two dvds along with a monday to friday calorie counting helped me drop from 120 to 107 in a matter of 2-3 months.,1309737600,5,470,4.247191011235955

I was still looking for something a little more cardio but in this same genre and I found it with Xtend Barre.  I LOVED this DVD - it was fun, reminded me a little of my ballet classes as a kid and it really gave me what I was looking for on the days I need more cardio.  Andrea is a great instructor, perfect!  I still love Burr's new DVD's and Exhale's, but this is going to be a staple in my DVD rotation.  Love it and highly recommend it!!  As a side note, I am a dressage rider and while I loved the visual results from the Jillian Michael's series, it virtually ruined my riding, which I find interesting since Jillian herself is a dressage rider.

4315082,5,B004BBDHFO,"A friend loaned me this video so I could make up my mind before investing in it.  I have some experience with workout videos in the ballet exercise/barre genre and wasn't quite prepared for Xtend Barre mentally.  By way of explanation: I'm very much into mind/body fitness (Pilates, yoga and fusions of the two modes with ballet inspired movements).  Generally, you get into an introspective and calmer mood with these workouts while you focus on the mind/body connection and precise movements.  So, my mind was geared into that line of thinking while I was putting Xtend Barre into the DVD player.

And then ... WHAM!  Andrea and her two fellow demonstrators start you moving at a pulse increasing pace right from the get-go.  The first time I did it, the warmup and arms segment were all I could muster because quite frankly I was breathing hard and confused due to my mind pre-locking into that subdued, balletic mood in advance.  So the second time I prepared for the fun, put on a smile and enjoyed the entire routine.  I never sweat so much during a barre workout and I also found it to be a mood booster, no doubt from the cardio effect.  This is a video a person can grow with.  I do plan to get it at some point, in the meantime I'll be ramping up my Pilates practice in an effort to master those side Teasers in the core section, which look so graceful.

I would have given it 4 stars because the core section just wasn't a favorite and at times the music was mildly annoying.  But I had to add back enough ""starrage"" because I really did enjoy Andrea's on screen persona, her very good cueing, the innovative warmup and upper body segment (loved it!) and the mood lifting element.

4315100,5,B004BBDHFO,"This DVD is led by Andrea Rodgers, a Pilates instructor and founder of the Xtend program.  In her Introduction to this DVD, Rodgers explains that she created this workout based on principles of Pilates and dance.  She teaches live in a bright studio with two background exercisers, Sharon, who modifies many of the moves, and Kamil, who performs some more advanced versions, including ballet jumps.  The only prop necessary is a sturdy chair, although I also found it helpful to use a mat.  (Note:  Rodgers and crew are wearing socks with non-skid bottoms; I performed the workout barefoot on a mat.)

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options (I've added some times/descriptions in parentheses):  Introduction (1m)--Tutorial (3.5m)--Workout Options--Bonus Features--Also from Acacia (trailers of 4 other Acacia DVDs)--Credits.  In the Tutorial, Rodgers briefly reviews the ballet terms and corresponding exercises that are used in the workout; although I have had some experience with barre-type workouts, I still found this to be helpful.  The Bonus Features include biographical information for Rodgers and then two short clips from other Acacia workouts, one from Shiva Rea's Creative Core Abs and one from Exhale: Thighs & Glutes (Parallel Thigh).

If you select Workout Options, you are taken to a submenu offering the following options:  Play All (55m)--Warm-Up (6m)--Upper Body (11m)--Barre (23m)--Core (10m)--Cool-Down (5m).  Unfortunately, the ""Play All"" option plays not just the workout segments but also the Introduction and Tutorial, although you can skip through these segments.  I have broken down each section in greater detail below.

Warm-Up (6m)
Rodgers moves FAST here and starts raising the heart rate immediately.  Instead of just doing the traditional knees up/arms up that are the norm for many barre workouts, Rodgers does knee raises with balance holds all on one side before switching to the other and finally alternating knees.  She also performs a rear curtsy squat, coming up into a knee lift (passe).

Arms (11m)
Rodgers suggests using between 1-3 lbs. for the arms work; I started with 3# but needed to drop down to 2# during the triceps work.  The first half felt similar to the arms work in Tracy Effinger's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Squeeze-30-Day-Body-Transformation/dp/B00274O8BE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Squeeze: 30-Day Body Transformation</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Effinger-s-Squeeze-Stronger-fitness-workout/dp/B001N8BKTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Effinger's Squeeze Stronger (fitness workout)</a>&nbsp;DVDs:  Rodgers keeps things constantly moving, doing many repetitions but using small, precise movements.  She suggests doing the next segment without weights, and I am glad she did.  Here she incorporates some balance work with unweighted upper body moves for the shoulder similar to the arms work in Classical Stretch (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classical-Stretch-The-Esmonde-Technique-Full-Body-Workout-Volume-1-Athletes-Intense-Stretch/dp/B0000B1A2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classical Stretch - The Esmonde Technique: Full Body Workout Volume 1 / Athletes Intense Stretch</a>, or perhaps Tracy Anderson, although I haven't personally done any TA DVDs).  Rodgers concludes the arms segment on the floor, starting with some tricep dips (I don't like doing these, especially after the triceps were already fatigued--it felt like overkill), knee push-ups, and a brief plank position.

Barre (23m)
This segment uses a chair.  Again, Rodgers keeps you moving the entire time, producing a strong cardio effect.  For those familiar with Tracey Mallet's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>, this section feels somewhat similar, as it is quick moving and even includes some kicks as Mallet does in her barre work.  Rodgers begins with plies on the toes in parallel, first, and second positions, with the advanced modifier, Kamil, adding in some jumps.  She has some large leg movements as well, with a a front attitude turning into a wide circle to the side.  Standing sideways behind the chair, another large movement involves stepping into second, turning to face the chair, stepping back, and stepping into first to finish.  This is followed by a split-leg lunge on the toes, and then there is a brief stretch (about 1.5m at the 11.5m mark).  The second half of the barre work concentrates more on the side and rear glutes.  Rodgers begins with side leg lifts; these are performed both pointing and flexing the leg.  Next comes a curtsy lunge, first lifting up to a knee hold (passe), then to a leg kick.  The final move involves standing glute pulses to the rear, and Rodgers concludes with a standing Figure 4 stretch.

Core (9.5m)
I was a little disappointed to discover that the majority of this segment is based on traditional crunch-type moves (which I usually try to avoid due to possible strain to the low back); given Rodgers's background as a Pilates instructor, I had expected her to incorporate more Pilates-type work here.  She starts with toe dips performed resting on the elbows, and then she moves on to torso twists performed in a c-curve position.  (Note: to protect my back, I did these and many of the exercises which follow with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Body-Back-Ball-Pump/dp/B00374O8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9"" Body Back Ball & Pump</a>&nbsp;under my sacrum.)  This is followed by a leg scissor move.  Next, Rodgers does borrow from Pilates by doing a variation on the Pilates Roll-Up, although unfortunately, the pace is unnecessarily super-fast.  However, I DID like the final few moves of this section, which are performed on the side.  Rodgers performs a side leg lift, side plank, and side teaser; these exercises were fun, safe, and a great way to target the obliques.  Rodgers concludes with a brief stretch.

Cool-Down (5m)
Rodgers first performs some brief floor stretches; she finishes standing for some balance moves and additional standing stretches.

Overall, I really liked this workout.  I was impressed that my heart rate stayed high throughout, and both the arms and the barre segments felt really effective.  I was a little disappointed in the core work, but I liked the final part of it (that targeted the obliques), and I think that I can modify the rest (using my Pilates ball) to suit my needs.  In the end, my final rating would be about 4 1/2 stars, and I would definitely recommend this workout.",1299888000,80,6800,5.878818737270875

8421830,5,B004BBDHFO,"The first time I tried this DVD, I was a little shocked because I didn't expect it to move so fast. It was the first time I'd seen an aerobic barre workout. I couldn't keep up and probably did only 40 of the 55 minutes. The second time, I did 50 of the 55 minutes, and now I can keep up. It's a great, overall workout and very efficient for those days when you want to combine strength + aerobics in under an hour. Normally, I do one of the Core Fusion DVD's plus a separate aerobic workout. This DVD is a great addition to my barre workout collection.",1502582400,3,552,4.073394495412844
8421831,4,B004BBDHFO,"I don't love the video, it is ok. I think that it could be more upbeat and fun but it is an OK workout. Not a substitute if you really love going to Barre classes",1498435200,,162,3.657142857142857
8421832,5,B004BBDHFO,"LOVE this workout! Before starting it, I thought I was in good physical shape. This workout kicked my butt! I love that it actually gets harder, the more you do this workout. Always by the end, I'm dripping in sweat. I wish she had more workout videos!",1485388800,,252,4.382978723404255

8421834,1,B004BBDHFO,I love barre workouts.  I did not like this particular one.  One of my personal favorites is Pop Physique.  Xtend Barre I find boring and the moves not dynamic enough.  I consider my fitness level between beginner and intermediate.,1483488000,2,231,4.846153846153846
8421835,5,B004BBDHFO,"One of my favorite workouts.  Especially on those days when I feel a little tired and don't want do anything extreme.  Nevertheless, this is a total body workout and will make you sweat, and depending on your stamina maybe swear too. ;)",1483488000,,236,4.595238095238095
8421836,5,B004BBDHFO,"This workout offers 3 levels making it both challenging and accessible.  The instructor, Andrea, is encouraging and upbeat without being overly perky.  I sweat, my muscles burn, my heart rate is up, and I still feel like a ballerina. What makes this routine so great is it is barre with cardio intervals to burn calories and tone.  It is not a twenty minute workout, but can be broken into segments.  Still, because of the length I don't do it as often as I like-Once or twice a week, but I think if I did it every day I would tire of it.  I look forward to the times I am able to do the full workout-it is like a treat.  I used to take ballet and cannot afford classes, so this is the next best thing.",1483142400,,702,4.125
