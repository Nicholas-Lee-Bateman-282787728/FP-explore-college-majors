2684320,3,B000K7VL4C,"I was very disappointed in this. I've seen all his specials, I have all the cd's and all the dvd's. I still have the 'Indecent Exposure' cassette and 'A Place for My Stuff' LP. I even got to see him live at the Hamilton Centre in Ontario so I'm a big fan.

I don't understand why he feels the need to come off so miserable. This was more uncomfortable to watch than anything. I did think, for the most part, 'Complaints & Grievences' was pretty funny but it had quite a few parts where he went just a little overboard. He seems to have let off on the brakes and gone totally overboard with this.

I hope he can re-think his direction and return to the days of 'Jammin' In New York'. It's just a little too much now to be funny. Carlin is still a pleasure to watch because he is so good but 'Life is worth losing' is a one-shot deal. You won't really want to watch it again. It's that uncomfortable.

Of course, I'm still buying it because I'm an idiot and my brain won't let me go without adding this to my collection.",1172793600,8,1018,4.157360406091371
2684321,5,B000K7VL4C,"Yes, I suppose some of us don't find reality funny.  I on the other hand think this show is absolutely hilarious.  If you're only into the ""hippy"" George and are hung up on the 7 words you can never say on television, and 70-80's George, then let me fill you in;  He's not headed in that direction.  This show is along the lines of his Complaints & Grievances show.  If you thought that show was funny, this is much funnier.  I have every crumb of Carlin that was released and I love this disk as much as any other.  Carlin has gone on record to say that ""if someone hasn't walked out of my show, then I haven't done my job."" He's always trying to piss off somebody.  He's been heading in this direction for the past 17 years, so what's the big surprise that he's even more vulgar and angry in this performance?  If you're surprised, you haven't been paying attention.  I on the other hand am glad that I HAVE been paying attention and that I've paid for this disk.  This is only my opinion...just like the reviews below.  Who's to say what's funny?  You'll just have to decide for yourself.  As long as he's working, there will always be something to learn about human nature.  God bless you George, keep up the good work.",1172534400,8,1223,4.325991189427313
2684322,1,B000K7VL4C,"My husband and I are long time fans of George Carlin.  This was a George Carlin that I had never seen in stand-up and I hope I never see again. His non-funny diatribe about human depravity and his crude discussion of human fragility was unsettling and I found it difficult to believe anyone in the audience was laughing.

George is certainly one of the brightest comedians around and most of what he discussed certainly resides in truth.  But the old George could take that truth and make it funny.  We did not find any of this act funny - only dark and depressing.  George offered a view of the future without hope and although his view may be correct, I would prefer to hold out for a tab bit of hope.

Either George goes back to pot before his next stand-up or I shall have to take it up to tolerate his new very dark attempts at humor. Please, lighten up George!",1172361600,16,866,4.314814814814815
2684323,4,B000K7VL4C,"George got a lot of flack for putting on a show like this. He talked (joked) about suicide, mass murder, having suicide on television, and other ""family friendly"" topics and to some this was more depressing than funny. Well if it's depressing, there's only one reason for it. As he points out we're the only creatures on this planet who do this sort of stuff. Animals can be territorial but for them, at the end of the day, it's about survival (i.e. finding a home, food, defense, etc,). Humans are the only creatures that do this stuff because we can.

Using that as a spring board, he catapults into his usual arguments of humans being completely hopeless because we've turned this great country of ours that was beautiful when we found it, actually we stole it, but anyway. We took this country and as turned it into ""a coast to coast shopping mall."" We seem, acording to him, to take anything we're handed now and not complain, not seeing how badly we're being screwed as long as we can keep buying stuff we don't need (That's why your here at Amazon right? :) ). We're for sale in that way and I agree with him.

When it's funny it's side splitting. When it's not, he's simply trying to shove his point home.",1171152000,11,1213,4.45945945945946

I would say if you want to complete your George Carlin show library, get this but if you do not want death talk and ""downers' - then skip this one and go for earlier Carlin.

2684400,1,B000K7VL4C,"So many other 1-star reviewers of Carlin's later work have already said what is so painfully obvious about the last 10-15 years of his career. And that is, he was supremely dark, nihilistic, and utterly bitter. You might have thought that with all of his innate intelligence, his curiosity about human nature, and his personal affluence, that he could have turned his critical eye on himself and tried to figure out what made him tick, what made him so disquieted. Instead of learning to forgive his violent, absent and alcoholic father, and his exacting, demanding mother (who was likewise a drinker and cruel and crazy), and learning to accept the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of human beings, he chose to rail against them, creating sophomoric caricatures of typical ""60s-liberal boogeymen"" and eventually embodied most of the things he claimed to hate about others.

And he passionately hated so many people by the end of his life, e.g. white people, males, Republicans, suburbanites, religious people, stupid people, fat people, boring people, rich people, average people, businessmen, consumers, New Agers, southerners, rednecks, athletes, yuppies, people who didn't speak the English language properly, and the list goes on. By the end of his life, he wasn't just poking fun at the human foibles of said groups, or the quirks that we all share, he was spewing ungodly vitriol, laced with as many profanities as possible. He truly and viscerally hated most people, not personally, of course, but collectively, in his own mind. His rage was white-hot and painful to listen to. I felt sorry for him.

And of course, like his old man, George also became a (sometimes violent) substance abuser for most of his adult life - alcohol and pot in the 50s and 60s, alcohol and cocaine in the 70s and 80s, and alcohol and pain killers in the 90s and 00s - for which he finally sought treatment in 2004. Good for him.

The comedic icon of the Hippie/anti-establishment/""peace, love, and understanding"" crowd became a most intolerant, wealthy and bitter old man. Oh sure, he could sound reasonable and well-adjusted in one-on-one interviews, but I'm sorry, you cannot scream profanities and contempt at your fellow man for 15 years and tell me, ""It was just an act."" No, unfortunately, he meant most of what he said.  The ""act"" was the way he said it. This show, like all of his work from the mid-1990s on, as well as his books, is an assault on humane sensibilities. Rest in peace, George.",1451520000,2,2486,4.926014319809069

2684444,5,B000K7VL4C,"Let me start-off by saying, George Carlin is possibly the greatest American comedian of all-time! He's definitely my favorite among many great ones (Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, etc.).
In ""Life is Worth Losing"" (from 2005), his facetious and hard-hitting wit is on full display for everyone to marvel at and laugh along uncontrollably. I'm not one to be shocked by Mr. Carlin's observations and routine, in this very harsh, but truly realistic examination of the American-cultural landscape (especially since I'm in total agreement with what he had to say, and I was left in profound admiration of his brutal honesty and brilliance that cuts right through all the BS).
George Carlin was not one to back-away/be scared-off by controversy (the censors and ""p.c. people""), to speak his mind as freely as he wished. And thank God for that. Because here, he gave us one of his most significant and unforgettable moments in his 50 year career, where he tells us exactly what ""the owners"" of this country really think of us!
And believe me, I know most of you will still be in denial about this very sad fact (but, if you are old enough to remember/seen the transformation of the U.S. in the past 30 odd-years or so), I can tell you it's all so very true!
 George Carlin of course, was more than just a comedian: I prefer to think of him as the last breed of a no-holds-barred American essayist---par-excellence. His routine here is so funny and hysterical, that it will be remembered as a true classic in his entire repertoire. I've seen it so many times, and now I finally get to own it. I highly recommend it, and if you're a George Carlin fan, I'm sure you don't need much encouragement anyway. This is an excellent and once-in-a-lifetime performance, buying ""Life is Worth Losing"" is highly worth it!

The DVD picture and sound quality by MPI is excellent. NTSC, English (English subtitles), 2.0 stereo, NR 73 mins.

He rants on and on about how terrible things are in the world, and he somehow manages to squeeze a laugh out of you while doing it.  However, in his second to last special, he left the second part out.

He rants and raves at you for a hour or so about how the world is deteriorating into ""one big shopping mall"" and how you are being ruled by corporations and yet forgets to make any of it funny.  The audience just sits there, watching an old man yell at them.

There are funny bits, no doubt.  George Carlin deserves to be noted here for making us laugh at suicide, something that should be impossible to do.  Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between.  When making this special, Carlin seems to have forgotten that he is a comedian, and that we pay him good money to make us laugh.

2684490,5,B000K7VL4C,"Why is it that great American humorists tend, almost inevitably, to gravitate toward the dark and the morbid and the bitter in the final stages of their lives?  Mark Twain is the prototype example (if you've forgotten, find a copy of ""Letters from the Earth""), but there are a multitude of others: Russell Baker, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank Sullivan...Groucho...even Will Rogers was dabbling in the early stages at the time of his tragically premature demise.  Why?  Maybe some of them begin to take themselves too seriously; but I think most simply grow tired of the relentless pressure to be hilarious every single time.  Occasionally you see evidence of this, right in their work:  In ""I'll Take Manhattan"", a fat old lady walks up to Woody Allen -- another prototype example -- and says, ""My husband and I love your films; especially the early funny ones!""

So I suppose it's not surprising that George Carlin, who will surely be remembered as one of the greatest of great American humorists, followed this same dark path in the twilight of his long career.  The trend is evident from the beginning of the HBO specials, and reaches a climax in this macabre offering.  Is it over the top?  Of course -- but what Carlin material, from ""AM and FM"" on, wasn't?  Is it disturbing?  Yes -- but George always enjoyed disturbing his audiences, prodding them into a bit of independent contemplation.  Is it his best stuff?  No -- he sounds too much like a bitter old man, as he sometimes did during the last few years -- but like just about everything else he wrote, it's freaking brilliant -- and that's why it gets 5 stars, and an unreserved recommendation from me.

Like most Carlin material, this is not for small children, or for self-righteous Fox News Channel devotees.",1317168000,,1816,4.797427652733119

2684495,3,B000K7VL4C,"Out of all the Carlin specials I've recently seen with the ""All My Stuff"" boxset, I can safely say ""Life is Worth Losing"" is a centerpiece of George Carlin's catalog despite not being at the forefront of his performances. Prior to purchasing ""All My Stuff,"" I had previously purchased the mp3 album of this show, and really, despite knowing/hearing all the material beforehand and considering it was pretty far from being my favorite outing by the comedian, the video recording of this show really caught me off guard in an unexpected way.

At the beginning of the show, Carlin announces his 341 days of sobriety, and that fact that 2006 will be his 50th year in show business. This shows in his appearance (his face is much, much fuller) and he doesn't really bounce around the stage as much as before. The man looks tired, and the four years between this show and 2001's Complaints and Grievances where obviously not kind to him. You just can't decipher this kind of stuff (as much) in the audio recording, and it adds to the darker nature of this material. Again, George has always been dark, but this is really dark, and as such isn't the Carlin album I listen to for a good, solid Chuckle. This is the Carlin album I listen to when I want to read between the lines and sense the pain that is present within the artist. In the end, this is a show that he had to do, to recuperate and move forward with his normal brand of comedy, which he did with 2008's ""It's Bad For You.""

Appropriately titled, ""Life is Worth Losing"" is an undeniably poignant performance of Carlin's, it's just far from being the most accessible. It's the last show I'd recommend to fans to watch, it won't become a staple for the right reasons but it should be seen regardless. It is kind of a downer that ""All My stuff"" concludes with such a somber performance, but it really is an important piece in the puzzle of a man we all knew, but probably never really knew.",1248134400,11,1942,4.483050847457627

2684507,4,B000K7VL4C,"Loaded with ideas and insights into the human condition. But this time with a twist of darkness.  During this his 13th HBO special George definately makes it known just what an angry person he is.  Like Lenny Bruce, George hates the world and everyone in it.  He pokes fun at everything from people who commit suicide to how much he enjoys watching natural disasters kill hundreds of thousands of people...and always wishes thing get even worse for them. I dearly loved George and wil definately miss him. He was getting old here and this may have been his last concert.  He had gained weight in this performance and he slips up several times.  I once heard him say he comes up with all this stuff while taking vicodine and drinking wine and that he was wired during almost every one of his performances.  He had kicked the habit here and it shows.  Forever a George Carlin Fan!",1220227200,3,878,4.554140127388535

2684509,3,B000K7VL4C,"I have loved George Carlin since I was a teenager and although I may have not have agreed with some of his views along the way, or sometimes thought he went a little too far, I could always laugh at his material, even when it may have hit a bit too personal, I could still see the ridiculousness of the situation. That being said, I was deeply disappointed in this show. It was all VERY true, and he hit the nail right on the head with a lot of the problems in this country, it just wasn't funny. As a speech, or a monaloge, it was brilliant. It was very deep, it made you think and made you nod in agreement at times, but it did not make you laugh, the very thing a stand up COMEDY show should do.
George was always controversial, he always stepped on peoples toes and made no apology for it. -And that's what we loved! But he did it with a twist of irony, a chance to see the absurdity in the world around us. This show was NOT George, George would slam us all for our laziness, our consumption, our greed, and in that he'd show us how ridiculous we were. This George was the angry Uncle Dave, spewing his anger from his armchair, one rant after another, no pauses. George would hold up a mirror to our society, and show us how silly we were. The George here was just the angry parent berating us for our stupidity. As a commentary on the world around us, it's amazing. -As a respite and a chance to laugh, it was horrible. Just keep that in mind. If you are looking for serious social commentary, go ahead and buy it. If you're looking for laughs, look to his earlier works.",1218240000,7,1577,4.173770491803278
2684510,5,B000K7VL4C,"This was one of George's last great wake  up calls  to a lazy and  stupid American public that allows the crooked , powerful and few to loot our national  treasure, abuse the poor,  and kill our children.  This isn't the hippy dippy  weatherman  of his  earlier  days nor  is  it  the very funny things  we  all have in common of Brian  Regan or Jerry Seinfeld...this  is a LION IN  WINTER!!!  George loves this country and says so..he loves the freedoms we USED to have as well.  George points out how this beautiful land has been turned  into a coast to coast shopping mall and he hits couch potatoes hard (hence  some of  the negative reviews)...

With the exception of the vagina donor program and the bit on the national disaster, this is amazing. It is not overly funny at all. It is actually quite scary because most of what he says is so true. But most of it is stuff that most people don't want to talk about. It's basically a critique on modern America and how misguided we all are. Consumerism has taken over our lives. If you really listen to it, it is amazing how he puts it all together. I cannot imagine how long it took him to organize it all. It is brilliant. But this is not light-hearted comedy in the least. Be prepared.

With his passing I thought I would get a DVD to celebrate his life and wit. This was the only title (now I know why) left on the shelf at a local store. There is nothing funny in this act. You can feel the audience so desperate for a laugh that they laugh at the simplest lines and some that I don't think were even meant to be funny.

2684514,2,B000K7VL4C,"My God. Is this really George Carlin? THE George Carlin? The one I grew up with who was so funny? Whose humor was cutting edge and bitingly spot on? What I'm seeing nowadays is an old, bitter man who ceaselessly attacks everything about America and, well... just about everything else.

Like so many others who have reviewed this, and other, George Carlin performances, I am a huge fan who has become disenchanted with his most recent stuff. I can only believe that those who have rated his newest albums so highly are people who either have never heard his earlier material or have and yet somehow think a man who is ranting and raving onstage about everything he hates is funnier than the clever, witty, genuinely funny man that Carlin once was.

I am saddened at what he has evolved/devolved into these days. He doesn't seem to realize that he has become, in many ways, the same type of person he sanctimoniously rails against. For instance, he consistently insults religion as a bunch of sheep being brainwashed by fire and brimstone preachers, and yet he, himself, does the exact same thing. He is preaching to his new disciples about the evils of man, America and any institution he despises which, sadly, appears to be just about all of them. That's fire and brimstone of a different, yet disturbingly similar, type. I find it hypocritical.

Anyone who grew up in the '70s and '80s with George Carlin knows what a genuinely hilarious and clever guy he is/was. He made me laugh out loud with each new album. I have seen him live six times and his shows were always fresh and funny. I'm truly sorry to say that he has lost whatever it was that made him great. Each new performance nowadays seems to be filled with more and more bitterness and vitriol. I guess there are people who like that kind of thing. I'm not one of them. George Carlin jumped the shark years ago. I fervently hope this is his last album because I want to remember the George Carlin that made him the best comedian of his time. Unfortunately, that time is past.

Carlin was always on the cutting edge of comedy, and no one who grew up loving the man's humor can be called a prude, so anyone attempting to call people like me who believe he is a shadow of his former greatness a prude or 'out of touch' doesn't get it. He was ALWAYS controversial. It's just that he also used to be very funny; something he is occasionally now, but not consistently. The only thing consistent about his comedy now is his constant negativity about everything.

I used to be able to recite, word for word, his greatest routines, from his AM and FM album to his Playin' With Your Head album, that's how big a fan I am. That's why this new, bitter old man disappoints me so. The younger generation, who is growing up with increasingly more shock entertainment, from radio to TV to movies, may think George Carlin is great. If so, good for them. I'm glad they enjoy his new brand of humor and more power to them. I daresay that those of us who don't like it are those who are familiar with his older material and know that his recent stuff is very inferior to it.

Peace.",1199232000,7,3124,4.481546572934974
2684515,5,B000K7VL4C,"I have been a George Carlin fan since the late 60's so I hate to write this review but, to keep it simple, don't waste your money.  This is the worst single performance I've ever seen Carlin give.  It's not only not funny, it's sad.  Carlin slurs his words and, at times, forgets his material.  At one point, he picks up a sheet of paper and reads from it stumbling as he does so.  He clearly could not remember the routine although it concerned the topic of the show.  I couldn't help but wonder if he noticed the audience wasn't laughing.  And the audience only laughed three times that I heard.

After 50 years in comedy and legendary performances in those years, it's time for Carlin to realize that he doesn't have it anymore.  He is no longer funny or relevant.  As I watched, I wished there had been someone close enough to this great comic to tell him this routine was one too many and that he needn't embarass himself.

Oddly enough, I bought two of ""Life Is Worth Losing"" because one was to be a gift to someone who'd love George Carlin.  This is so terrible, I sent the gift back.  Please let it go now George, we'll still love you for all you gave us.",1196726400,2,1163,4.279816513761468
2684536,5,B000K7VL4C,"This would be one of George Carlin's most cynical shows ever (next to ""You Are All Diseased""). But that doesn't mean that it isn't good. The first time I saw this show was online, and I'll admit, it kinda depressed me at first. It was really funny, but it was also really dark material. But the reason why it put me down slightly was because he was right on a lot of what he was talking about. I decided to buy it and after the second time I saw it, I found it to be even funnier. His opening skit, ""Modern Man"" is truly one of the best openers I've ever seen from a comedian. ""Suicide Guy"" was really eye opening in a sense that it dealt with suicide in a realistic, but hysterical way. ""Natural Disasters"" had me in stitches because I'm sure that many people have felt the same way as he discussed (whether you admit it or not). But I would not recommended this show to new Carlin fans, I would start off with ""Back In Town"" or ""Complaints and Grievances"" to warm you up for this one. This show truly captivates George Carlin at his best. I see this show as half comedy show, and half social commentary, and I bought it for both.",1192147200,9,1131,4.192660550458716
2684537,5,B000K7VL4C,"This is the logical progression of Carlin's humor as the hippy dippy weatherman ages: he's gittin' cranky as he sees things becoming worse instead of better. We ain't evolving, we're becoming desensitized to all manner of atrocitae, and George is here to stick our noses in it.

Dark yes, funny yes, not perfect yes. But give the man props for having the balls to call it as he sees it, decade after decade.

{Edit-7/12/08: And now that he's gone, my guess is this show will be seen in the light it deserves: a truly intelligent and trenchant social commentator telling the truth about modern America...whether we like it or not.

Looking at some of the negative reviews here, I have to laugh at their complaints about how dark this is and proclaiming that GC's lighter side is where it's at. So an artist can't ever stray from what works for him and move into new avenues of perception? He can't simply tell the truth as he sees it, even if it's not always funny?

I think George more than earned the right to give us a dead-on rant like this. He made us laugh for over forty years. So at the end of his life he ain't allowed to call it precisely as he sees it...and as it truly is? Damn right he's got the right. He earned it. Plus, there is endless truth here. Too bad for those who can only handle jokey jokes. And hell, there are plenty of laughs, but they're aimed at those who dig Monty Python or Bill Hicks more than Andrew Dice Clay or Joan Rivers.

For those who appreciate a rare shaft of truthlight cutting through the cloud cover of 21st century bs, it doesn't get much more direct and correct than this.

Rest in peace, George. You did your job as well as any comedian who ever lived. Maybe better.}",1189728000,64,1713,4.371069182389937

2684540,2,B000K7VL4C,"I've adored George Carlin's unique comedy voice for years now, but was very disappointed with Life Is Worth Losing. It's too dark and nowhere near funny enough. The opening routine consisting of a monologue made from 21st Century popular culture phrases is thoughtful but not very funny, and goes on waaaay too long. Unfortunately, the same can be said for the rest of the show. I've no problem with dark humour - Carlin's People Who Should Be Killed routine on his last HBO show was hilarious. But here,the lack of laugh-out loud moments just makes his misanthropic material deeply depressing. At one point Carlin even does an Assassination routine about how it's always the good people who get murdered that's practically a word for word copy of a routine the late Bill Hicks did 13 years ago! What's going on here George?!

 But probably the saddest thing here is hearing Carlin stumble trying to memorize his material - I appreciate his advanced age, but too many times he loses momentum by mumbling ""er...."" mid routine, something his razor sharp brain hardly ever did before whenever performing.

I'll always love George's previous work, and hope he releases at least one more DVD/CD that's the thoughtful and FUNNY George of old. But I won't be watching Life Is Worth Losing again.",1182902400,9,1288,4.872146118721461

Although his political correctness is probably the worst ever, what do you expect, it's Carlin.
