211777,2,6300164063,"This is a good movie, no doubt about it, is not a great movie but you can seat back, relax and enjoy walter hill's ( not at his best...i rather go with Southern Confort) great action secuences. Nick Nolte character is real wick and Maria conchita Alonso it's horrible and the ""no storyline"" about some double crossed ex -friends is really dumb!.  The dvd its a dissapointment ...pure full screen trash, the tranfer is bad and it  doesn't have any extras.....my greatest complain about this movie is that it is a really bad imitation of a great western classic.....THE WILD BUNCH. it just to get near it. the plot is very likely but does not get there...good gunfights but not as incredible as SAM PEKINPAH'S MASTERPIECE. The shootout at the final moments of the film save the day but never matches the autenticity, greatness and cinematografic beauty of the WILD BUNCH'S cold blooded 6 minutes long violent mayhem. IF you really like this film, i recomend you take a look at THE WILD BUNCH and you will start havind second opinions about EXTREME PREJUDICE.  two stars for the film none for the dvd.",1002585600,2,1098,4.678756476683938
211778,3,6300164063,"As with the previous reviewer; I also agree that caveat emptor...buyer beware!  I love this movie but was very unhappy to learn that the DVD was only in the Fullscreen format.  As with Remember the Titans, I am learning to be a little bit more careful with my assumption that all DVDs are in the Widescreen/Letterbox edition.  There are very basic scene selections and an even more basic Bio page for this DVD.  No zoom, no subtitles...not too much to impress, just the meat and potatoes.  A good movie to watch, but don't expect the DVD format to impress, or entertain you beyond the movie.",990748800,2,591,4.59047619047619
211779,4,6300164063,"""5 Star... Action Packed... Must Have Movie!""
Nick Nolte Stars as Jack Benteen... a modern day, tough as they come Texas ranger who finds himself in a show down on both sides of the border that can only leave one man standing. Ranger Benteen matches his skill for survival against long time best friend turned drug smuggler, Cash Bailey (Powers Booth). In this mix is the woman they've both loved, played by Maria Conchita Alonzo,who moves back and forth between their lives and becomes the ""prize"" for the winner of their ultimate ""to the death"" meeting.
While Benteen battles with drug runners, a squad of ""deceased"" U.S. military personnel with special skills (led by Michael Ironside) becomes involved in the plot when they come together for a mission... to take out Cash Bailey and his drug operation, as a matter of ""national interest"". This mission takes the military specialist... and Ranger Benteen across the border for an exciting, explosive ending that takes a twist and will bring you to the edge of your seat.
This is a ""must have"" action flick of the best kind. Suspense and intrigue will grip you in this bullet flying, R- rated thriller!",983923200,2,1154,4.833333333333333

211875,5,6300164063,"Although it's a shame the US never came out with a widescreen, let alone Blu-ray version of this movie after many years of waiting, this works for me. I bought my copy off Ebay (price is extremely high on here), but picture quality and Dolby sound is excellent on this. Takes a minute to learn to navigate the non-English menu, but once you got it down it's a piece of cake. By default the subtitles are on so you'll have to manually turn them off. Only down side to this disc is there are no extras, just the trailer. But finally being able to watch it in crisp Blu-ray and in widescreen format is more than enough bonus for me. One of Powers Boothe's best roles (RIP).",1497830400,,670,4.283464566929134

211943,5,6300164063,"This film came out during the late 80's action movie boom and was sadly lost in a sea of more populate and higher budgeted adventure flicks the year it came out. The film focuses on a hard as nails Texas Ranger played by Nolte who is trying to keep his town from becoming overrun by a drug cartel led by his childhood friend. Things become more complicated when a team of elite black ops commandos show up to eliminate the same cartel leader. While this movie passes as a fast paced action film, it plays more like a modern day Western and is all in all a great film.

You like him, but know he has to go down.  Rip Torn steals the scenes he is in as a small town sheriff and the adviser to Nick Nolte's Texas Ranger.  Nolte plays a no nonsense, hard as nails Texas Ranger who never smiles and never gives an inch.  He also never smiles.  The storyline has two friends, one a Texas Ranger and one a drug dealer, who grew up together driving towards an eventual showdown.  They grew up together and both love the same girl, but she is with the Ranger now.  The exciting action and entertaining performances make it a excellent way to pass the time.

I would like once, one time in my life, to see an action film that is in the least believable. My comment on this film is that nowhere is there even one five minute stretch that does not suspend belief. Are stories THAT hard to write, are the writers THAT lazy that they can't come up with anything more closely related to the real world? That being said all sci-fi for example is not possible basically, nor soap operas, nor a lot of other ones, so that shouldn't get too much in the way and I still give it four stars.",1405468800,,617,4.237288135593221

This movie has been cropped or cut off on the sides to accommodate a TV screen. I watch movies on a 21st century device and feel very cheated to pay $7.00 for a movie with such poor quality presentation. Also, it has no closed captions. Now these issues may not concern you but they are major to me.
  This will probably be the last movie I purchase from Amazon. Maybe this isn't the correct place to complain but until I find a better forum this is my attempt. Amazon should list the format available for each video rather than leave it such a pot luck affair",1390003200,,688,4.244274809160306

It stars Nick Nolte and Powers Boothes as old childhood friends on different sides of the fence, One a Texas Ranger an the other a drug dealer. Nolte looks the best in many years, lean and taut as the Texas Ranger who must bring in His old friend who's outta control . The movie starts out interesting as We see a bunch of MIA's soldiers who on paper are dead come into this town as some type of covert mission who have their own agenda in Noltes town  lead buy Micheal Ironside . 2/3 of this movie is good , then losing its feet toward the end in which turns out as a remake of the ""Wild Bunch "". Reading many reviews here by others say the films seems grainy, well I seen it on Cable HD an I believe its the film stock which is the problem .

212227,3,6300164063,"Seen worse, seen better.  The good points below, but first the bad:

Editing is kind of choppy, picture quality wasn't fantastic, script occasionally reads wooden with a small dose of melodrama (Lone Ranger vs Mexican drug baron - what do you expect?). In a nutshell, it's a low-budget 80s action movie.  I've surely seen worse films.  This one was better than average thus a rating of 3.5 stars.

The plot gets points for being more complex than your average cowboy cop shoot 'em up.  What starts off as seemingly two different stories later converge into one, leaving you something to chew on as the movie progresses.  I liked that I couldn't see the ending from a mile off and that the plot had a few complexities, never mind how unbeleivable or ""A-team gone bad"" they were.  Another plus for the movie is its quick pacing.  While it may not be the most intriguing thing you've seen in a while, it won't put you to sleep either.

Nolte is a great actor when he does good films, but he's done a few bombs as well (see ""Q & A"" by Sydney Lumet - better yet, don't see it).  With ""48 Hours"", ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"", and even ""The Good Theif"" on my roster for 5-star Nolte movies, and ""Q & A"" on the other end, this falls somewhere in the middle.  It wasn't awful, perhaps was better than average in the large scheme.  Nolte fans will probably want to check it out, but it's a forgettable film finally. On the other hand, while this movie will soon be reaching 'artifact' status, Mexico's drug problem is still a current event.  Apparently it was that way in 1987 too.  As for the movie, I'd rent it.

Hill has assembled a great rogues gallery of character actors and allows them to chew the scenery.  Take note:  Powers Booth(Hill's ""Southern Comfort"" and Milius' ""Red Dawn""), Michael Ironside(TV's ""V""), William Forsythe (""Raising Arizona"", ""Once Upon a Time in America""), Clancy Brown(""Highlander"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption""), Rip Torn(too many films to mention) and not the least Tony ""Tiny"" Lister(""The Fifth Element"" and ""Jackie Brown"").

212254,4,6300164063,"Nick Nolte must have ground his molars down to a fine powder in EXTREME PREJUDICE, a 1987 high-octane action flick from veteran action director Walter Hill.  Nolte plays a modern day Texas Ranger in a small Texas town on the Mexican border who spends a good deal of time running down (and gunning, of course,) `raggedly-blank dirt farmers' who smuggle drugs over the border to make ends meet.  Nolte plays it clenched of jaw and short of patience in a monochromatic tooth-grinding manner - when he isn't angry, well... he's angrier.  A `stone-age cowboy,' someone in the movie calls him, a buckaroo who natcherally wants to go after the big fish, drug kingpin Powers Booth.  Trouble is Booth is south of the border and out of his jurisdiction - not to mention he's a childhood friend of Nolte's, and an old squeeze of Nolte's live-in girlfriend Maria Conchita Alonso.

 The presence of a woman with billing so near the title and situated so vital to the plot - side three of one of those love triangles - is always worrisome in movies with big guns and fast cars.  Nothing takes the air out of an action flick quicker, or more completely, than a loving woman and a caring man. As if to reassure us, the movie has Nolte and Alonso get into a `where's our relationship going?' conversation.  Maria Conchita is thinking of going back to the bad guy and wants to talk about it with Nolte.  Their conversation ends with Nolte uttering the best line in the movie before walking out - ""I can't talk.  I got to do.""  And do he does.  Either complicating or adding texture to the plot is the presence of a group of CIA-sponsored paramilitary types in the background, black helicopter types who drive around in a converted A-team van and divert us from growing restless waiting for the inevitable Nolte-Booth showdown. Even the ever-reliable Rip Torn is around, for a while, as a local sheriff.  Around to ride shotgun for Nolte, weave homespun observations, and mainly wear out his vocal cords handling three characters-worth of exposition - ""You know Sarita used to go with Cash when you were out east..."" It's a thankless job, but Torn pulls it off without missing a beat.

 There's a handsome, gritty, dust blowing, oily sweat feel to EXTREME PREJUDICE.  Powers Booth, who more or less owns the last third of the movie, adds a healthy dose of menace when Nolte finally chases down south of the border. In the good action flicks, and EXTREME PREJUDICE is one, the good guy usually has to bring out the heavy lumber to stay even with the bad guy. Bad guys can do cool things, like squash scorpions in their bare hands. The best a good guy can do is bark at a fumbling deputy to get those prints to the FBI right away. To his credit, Nolte keeps pace, and if we don't get too emotionally involved with any of the characters, or leave this one with any meaningful lessons learned, their final confrontation is satisfyingly intense.

Nolte plays a Texas Ranger out to settle a score with former friend and current enemy, Powers Boothe.  Between them they play tug-o-war over Maria C.

  I first saw this Walter Hill movie around '88, and only on VHS, and it has always been on my top 10 list. Back in the day's before Robert Rodriquez,and Q.T. And when those of us on the east coast had no access to Hong Kong Cinema, Walter Hill was a name action fans looked for, along with the better known names of stylized action, Sergio Leone, Sam Peckenpaugh,Richard Donner, and John McTiernen. All of these directors delivered lots of entertaining action,but for my money in the 80s Hill delivered big time with this modern day western.
  Performances are strong and memorable. What scenery isn't destroyed by gun fire is chewed to pieces. Rip Torn, and Powers Booth create characters that are especially fun. Nick Nolte does a great job of playing a Texas Ranger, in a mythological kinda way.
 The direction is sharp despite some minor plot holes, but of course the action sequences are steller.
 Big question now is ""How long must we wait for a good DVD version of this film?"" Widescreen is a must.",1081382400,40,1137,4.521951219512195
212289,4,6300164063,"""Extreme Prejudice"" is one of those special films that should have worked like gangbusters with the action thriller crowd. Thanks to director Walter Hill (the same guy who later did ""48 Hours""), this ultra violent shoot 'em up picture boasts an amazing cast, over the top performances, stark atmosphere, high testosterone, and lots of firepower all wrapped up in a style that would make Sam Peckinpah cry with joy. With all of the positives going for it the film failed to draw great box office receipts. Why? Several reasons, actually. As great as the pieces of ""Extreme Prejudice"" are independently, director Hill failed to integrate the parts into the sort of seamless whole film critics appreciate. Some movies wildly succeed despite traveling down a road pitted with plot holes. Others manage to just squeak by despite their difficulties, and this is the case with Hill's film. It doesn't quite have what it takes to become a cult classic, can't totally overcome its numerous failings, but this movie survives because it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, namely entertain its target audience.
Texas Ranger Jack Benteen (Nick Nolte) is a cop's cop and a man's man. Working the beat down in on the Texas-Mexico border, Benteen regularly puts his man down when the time comes for killing. Often operating in tandem with feisty and foul-mouthed local sheriff Hank Pearson, Benteen's biggest problem in the heat blasted climes of Southern Texas is curbing narcotics trafficking. When he isn't out killing local boys gone bad Jack argues incessantly with his live in lover Sarita Cisneros (Maria Conchita Alonso), a woman who works as a singer at the local watering hole and who just happens to be the former girlfriend of ex-cop and now big time drug dealer Cash Bailey (Powers Boothe). Benteen and Bailey get along with each other despite their differences largely due to an unspoken agreement the two have about staying out of each other's way, but that's all about to change after Pearson dies in a violent shootout with some local drug dealers ostensibly working for Bailey's outfit. Now it's personal for Benteen (shouldn't it have been before?), and nothing will get in his way as he prepares to bring down Bailey once and for all.
Then a problem materializes. The federal government, hoping to stem the flow of narcotics into the country, orchestrates a black operation composed of elite ex-military specialists and sends them into Benteen's stomping grounds to wipe out Cash Bailey. These guys are highly trained killers operating under such heavy secrecy that the feds faked the soldiers' deaths in order to protect their identities. Headed up by a thug named Paul Hackett--a man who has his own dirty little secrets--the team plans to rob a bank so they can steal Bailey's files. Perceiving Benteen as a potential problem, Hackett plays the part of a sympathetic DEA agent and feeds the Texas Ranger false information to keep him out of the picture until the operatives can finish the mission. Predictably, the robbery goes horribly awry, a couple of the team members end up in Benteen's jail, and out comes the dirty laundry. Jack teams up with Hackett's team as they head to Bailey's hideout in Mexico, still determined to do in Bailey and liberate the hapless Sarita while he's at it (You didn't think the girl would stay safely behind in Texas for the entire film, did you?). The conclusion is pure Peckinpah as the entire compound erupts into total gunfire riddled chaos.
For all its flaws, I still like watching ""Extreme Prejudice"" whenever I get the chance because the performances are so much fun. Nick Nolte is at his sweaty, scene chewing best as the relentless cop Jack Benteen. Rip Torn plays Sheriff Hank Pearson so over the top that he is a wonder to watch. Maria Conchita Alonso serves mainly as eye candy in her scenes, and Powers Boothe doesn't start rocking and rolling until the end of the film. The real show stealers here is Hackett's gang. Check out the actors involved in these roles: Michael Ironsides, William Forsythe, Clancy Brown, Matt Mulhern, Larry B.Scott, and Dan Tullis Jr. all play critical parts. If you aren't familiar with low budget cinema, you might not recognize these names or faces, but the rest of us who follow these types of movies know this list represents a goldmine of talent. If you've ever wondered how these guys would work together in a single film, ""Extreme Prejudice"" is your movie. Heck, even Tom ""Tiny"" Lister turns up here in a small role as one of Bailey's main henchmen. About the only guy missing from the roster is Randall ""Tex"" Cobb. Throw these actors into a plot loaded with gunfire, the heat blasted plains of Texas and Mexico, and a script that isn't afraid to punch up the testosterone laden dialogue to unheard of levels, and you have the makings for an entertaining couple of hours.
Sadly, plot holes abound. I still cannot figure out how Benteen could run a computer check on two of Hackett's men and discover that they are supposedly dead. Wouldn't the government cover its tracks with loads of high tech wizardry to prevent some backwoods cop from finding out who these guys are? Moreover, some of the scenes in the film are laughably ridiculous. For example, Bailey blows some guy's head off because of a drug dispute, and then promptly cozies up to Sarita as though nothing happened. In what universe would a woman readily accept with open arms a man who just committed a grisly murder IN FRONT OF HER just seconds before? Only a guy could write such nonsense into a script and think it would work. Give ""Extreme Prejudice"" a look if you like movies like ""Roadhouse."" If not, skip it.",1078185600,26,5678,4.836587872559096

I hope that the people at artisan entertainment get wise and clean up the print and properly re-release this gem from the '80s.",1039305600,4,912,4.710691823899371
212292,5,6300164063,"A tough Texas Ranger stands on one side of the border - Jack Benteen (Nick Nolte). His goal is to clean up the mexican drug traffic. On the other side of the Rio Grande stands Cash Bailey (Powers Boothe) - a ruthless narcotics kingpin who`ll stop at nothing to get his way...friends since childhood and now bitter
adversaries.
What`s left between them is the love of a beautiful girl, played by Maria Conchita Alonso.
And secretly, a government commando team (Michael Ironside, William Forsythe) moves into town. Their mission is to steal millions of drug dollars stashed in a bank. The heist quickly forces the two men into the ultimate confrontation...where only one can survive.
EXTREME PREJUDICE from 1987 is a great movie, and one of my favorite movies. Strong violent action and bad language. From the director Walter Hill (48 hrs. 1982, Another 48 hrs. 1990,  Red Heat 1988).
The DVD-Edition from ARTISAN Entertainment is much better than the VHS-Tape released by AVID Home Entertainment.",1033171200,3,995,4.993975903614458
212293,1,6300164063,"The movie's fine.  Good acting.  Good story.  Too bad, then, the tape itself [stinks], and that's simply because it was recorded at ""Agonizingly Excrutiatingly Super Slow Save Money on Tape"" speed. I have many other low-priced tapes that are clear and sharp because the outfit producing them recorded them at SP.  This particular tape was produced by ""AVID Home Entertainment.""  I lasted about 45 minutes before saying to hell with it.  During that 45 minutes I was constantly adjusting tracking.  Go DVD unless you can find the film on VHS by someone other than this ""AVID Home Entertainment"" bunch.",1029801600,,600,5.0
212294,2,6300164063,"One of my all time favorite Walter Hill movies gets botched on DVD. If ever a movie deserved to be in the widescreen format,
this is it! The movie is cropped horribly! Also no 5.1 sound,
only mediocre stereo. Artisan should do Hill fans a favor and
re-release it in widescreen. Buyer beware!",1025308800,6,291,4.509433962264151
212295,4,6300164063,"Nick Nolte plays a Texas Ranger the way Chuck Norris plays Walker, only without all the kicking. This movie is violent, there is some nudity, and there is quite a lot of profanity. If that offends you, be forewarned. It also has one of the best character actors in the business in it, mr Rip Torn as the crusty old Texas sherrif. His performance alone is worth seeing the movie.",1004313600,2,378,4.414285714285715
212296,2,6300164063,"When it comes to steely eyed stares, Clint Eastwood has nothing on Nick Nolte. Except Nolte is a fine actor whose talents are largely wasted in this tiresomely Johnny-one-note performance. Powers Boothe whose on-screen charisma is a match for Nolte's, expresses a broader range as the villian, but apparently never got the big break his talent deserves. Too bad. The movie itself goes  downhill after a promising beginning. Director Walter Hill is simply unable to weave the subplots of a murky script by that avatar of violence for its own sake - John Milius - into anything like an engaging whole. The result is a fatal crash dive into gruesomely nonsensical parody of The Wild Bunch. The upshot provides a lesson  for those who have the blood lust of a Peckinpah, without his cinematic stylishness or moral sensibility. In fact, the film probably works better as parody, particularly Nolte's cartoonish Texas Ranger.  A waste of  fine talent on third-rate bravado. Save your money.",1002672000,,984,5.0184049079754605

This has guys movie written all over it. The Blu-Ray version is absolutely incredible.
