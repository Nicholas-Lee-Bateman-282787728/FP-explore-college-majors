7864371,3,6304145497,"About what I expected' not overly preachy about the more religious interpretation of ""A Christmas Carol"".  Fairly entertaining with Dean Jones narrating the play.  The only major departure from the story I couldn't get past is for some reason the characters of Scrooge's nephew and Bob Cratchet  have been turned into 1 character  named Bob Cratchet who is also Scrooge's nephew.  I simply see no reason for this change.  I guess I'm a traditionalist.

One additional note the play is a musical that is put on by a church.  It is not as polished as a Broadway play so don't expect that because you may be disappointed.  It is a local production and should be viewed as such.  As I said, I did like it , except for the Cratchet thing.",1387670400,,733,4.526717557251908
7864372,3,6304145497,"The VHS Video of the Gospel According to Scrooge that is described in the description is NOT the Gospel According to Scrooge that is shipped. I was a member of Jesus People Church in Minneapolis that originally did this adaptation, and had Dean Jones as the host of our production...the video I received is from an Assembly of God Church in Rockford Illinois. It was good and followed our original script, and had our original music;  but nobody portrays Ebenezer Scrooge as well as  Pastor Robert Buchanan did in our production. If you have not seen the Original production from Jesus People Church on Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, you will enjoy this production,,,,but I really wished it would have been our play............",1381881600,5,737,4.983739837398374
7864373,5,6304145497,I haven't seen the movie but I have attended about 30 stage productions of it and I can't get enough. This is a great play that will span the age and gender barriers. It brings the holiday season to heart. Check around your local Assembly of God churches and see if any of them are putting it on.,1100563200,6,296,4.120689655172414

I liked it so much I found a church that put on a live play and tried out for a part. This is a wonderful interpretaion of a great christmas story!",1100563200,7,280,4.017857142857143
