8695444,5,B00RKLQ7F4,"Expelled from Spain in 1492, Sephardic Jews settled in many different countries where the Ladino language they spoke and the customs they practiced thrived for hundreds of years.  Today, that language and those customs have fallen victim to assimilation.  *Trees Cry For Rain* recounts one woman's loving memories of the language, foods, music and traditions she enjoyed while growing up in Turkey and helps document the Sephardic culture for future generations to appreciate.",1427932800,4,476,5.506849315068493
8695445,5,B00RKLQ7F4,"This documentary is a very endearing Sephardic Journey that begins with a rendition of the title song Trees Cry for Rain (Arvores lloran por luvias) as sung by Esther Levy with harmonics by (possibly) Judy Frankel.  This is followed by Rachel Amado Bortnick introducing herself in Ladino (Judeo-espaol) and English and in effect welcoming us into her home.  She is charming throughout as she traces her Sephardic familys roots from Spain to Bayonne, France to Izmir, Turkey, and for herself on to the United States.  Along the way we are introduced to Sephardic culture, customs, food, and beautiful ladino songs.  Highlighted are some interesting differences between Sephardic and Azkenazi culture/customs.  Ladino is sprinkled throughout the film especially in the kitchen where Rachel and her friend Esther Levy are conversing and preparing borrecas and Turkish coffee for us and in the ladino songs that are a constant presence.  One lovely scene involves Rachel and renowned Sephardic Songcatcher Judy Frankel as she sings Trees Cry for Rain with an eye to gaining the correct Ladino pronunciation from Rachel.  Another is the solo that Esther Levy sings of another traditional ladino song En la mar (Out to Sea).  Two things really touched my heartstrings: Rachels desire for ladino to remain a living language and her connection with the refrain from Trees Cry for Rain  What will become of me?  I will die in a strange land.",1425513600,3,1432,5.1072961373390555
