8282246,5,B001B8NPOS,"Aubrey Manning is without doubt a very pleasing, thoughtful and unpretentious presenter.

Without bling and picture-centred self-promotion he succinctly describes the basic facts of these fascinating mysteries, examines the sites while asking all the right questions from a variety of experts, and concludes (or unravels) by allowing the opinions and evidence to suggest the most convincing explanation.

There is lots of additional, quite fascinating material uncovered in each episode. One comes away hugely edified.

The directing and camera work is top notch, with editing properly paced so one can absorb the usually beautiful scenery and contemplate the mystery and science behind solving it. The DVD transfer is as good as it gets.

If you loved Earth Story, then this excellent series is not to be missed.

PS. Be sure to get the complete 4 disc 8 episode boxed set.",1483056000,,874,5.258992805755396
