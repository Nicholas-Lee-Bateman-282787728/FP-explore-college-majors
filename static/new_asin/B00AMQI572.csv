5451496,5,B00AMQI572,"I highly recommend this video! it is one of the few DVDs on the market that provides a thorough guidance to dealing with upper body pain!  I used to have lots of pain in my back. Under the gentle guidance of Aparna, all of my problems are now behind my back.
The DVD provides different sequences that can be beneficial to the people with different levels and needs. It offers inside to the person who is experiencing back pain but has never tried yoga. At the same time, the DVD is provides lots of wonderful routines to the experiences yogi who want to strengthen the upper body area.
The DVD is shot in a wonderful setting. Aparna provides lots of explanation about the poses as well as modifying them according to one's level.
This is an excellent DVD to have for your yoga practice!",1356825600,,786,4.458333333333333
8553982,5,B00AMQI572,"This is the best yoga video I own.  It has three segments -- one for pain relief, one for therapy, and one for maintenance and strengthening.  It is gentle, yet deeply therapeutic.  I have been standing a lot straighter since using it.",1483488000,,235,4.5476190476190474

8553984,5,B00AMQI572,"The whole production of Yoga Therapy for Upper Body is simply gorgeous:  the setting, the music, and especially Aparna herself with her calm, reassuring voice and clear instructions.  To me the most inviting feature is the guided meditation section.  It deepens integration of the physical and mental practice which enables us to explore the spiritual beauty within ourselves.  Since my retirement five years ago I have finally been able to be consistent with my yoga practice.  However, I am sometimes troubled by an old shoulder injury.  I have found Aparnas Yoga Therapy for the Upper Body to be a most valuable supplemental tool to ease pain and regain strength. The variety of practice levels allows one to use this DVD in many ways over time.",1400371200,,748,4.944
8553985,5,B00AMQI572,"Aparna is a gifted and truly perfect instructor. Her balance between teaching you physical discipline, challenging your body just a bit further while teaching a gentle attending to your body's needs and abilities is something you will carry with you in life as well as every yoga practice. Enjoy developing strength and ability as you heal from chronic upper body pain or work to avoid developing pain by staying strong and flexible.

This can be for beginners, intermediate or advanced students. These therapeutic yoga videos very effectively address your pain, keep you strong if you are intermediate or challenge you if you are advanced.

Aligning your posture: By making you aware of your posture she teaches you how to begin to reduce the most common and most significant source of pain you experience. Then she has you analyze your own tendencies as you stand and walk to help you identify your problem areas. This informs you what you need to work on as you begin the practice and increases your mindfulness as you practice.

Relaxation and centered, mindful practice: Aparna's calm, intentional voice guides you through a short relaxation session prior to each practice and after each practice to help you reset & savor the therapeutic practice. You also have the option for meditations at the end as well.

Aparna has no ego to put forward. You are not distracted by her but rather she very knowledgably guides you through your individualized practice to maximize your benefit.

What I love best about Aparna and a huge part of what makes her the BEST YOGA instructor EVER is she is descriptive enough to allow you to turn inward and proceed with your practice while listening to her without having to constantly watch the TV to ensure you are doing it right. She says just enough. She doesn't talk just to fill the space: when she speaks, it is important.

The three sessions available here allow you to either address any chronic pain, maintain your current health or provide strength and stability. The chronic pain section helps heal those sore areas and recondition the proper muscles to ensure the pain will, with committed, regular practice, be a mere memory.

The Maintaning Health section challenges you just enough to keep your body nimble, flexible and comfortable.

The Strength and Stability section pushes the advanced practitioner to continue to challenge and further his/her practice. Enjoy this video for all the skills you will learn from this truly gifted instructor!",1400284800,,2495,4.995180722891567
8553986,5,B00AMQI572,"I love this DVD and practice the exercises on it often!  It helps me counteract my chronic shoulder inflammation due to the many hours of keyboard and mouse use.  I like that there are 3 levels to choose from that can suit my needs at the time.  Besides helping with neck, shoulder, and upper back issues, this DVD is excellent for maintaining strength and flexibility in the upper body.

8553987,5,B00AMQI572,"I would recommend this DVD for anyone with upper back/shoulder tightness, stiff, or pain. It definitely comes from a yoga perspective and philosophy but yoga experience is not necessary to receive benefit. I have recommended it to several friends who do not practice yoga but find the DVD easy to follow and extremely helpful, especially those who sit hunched over a computer all day. I have also recommended it to my athletic son who lifts weights and is overly stiffening his shoulders and upper back. I practice yoga regularly but always find time periodically for a session to focus on my upper body with this DVD and to incorporate certain postures into my regular practice. I like all three levels! Aparna's voice and clear instruction will help you feel better and set you on a path of improved mobility and function.",1399248000,,824,4.851063829787234
8553988,5,B00AMQI572,"I love how Aparna moves from very gentle, restorative flows to more advanced flows on this DVD. I consider myself to be an intermediate level yoga practitioner, and I've found even the more gentle flows to be useful.
One of the best things about the DVDs is that they capture an intimacy that's very encouraging.
Her knowledge of anatomy and yoga plus her suggestions for what's useful for restoring strength, flexibility and balance brings a sense of authority that's balanced by her genuineness.
The flows are original and fun. I find myself borrowing from them for my own classes, and if you're an instructor, these are really great guides to teaching, as well.",1385942400,,664,4.884955752212389
8553989,5,B00AMQI572,We bought this at the same time as the lower body DVD and have enjoyed them equally.  Aparna's pace and instructions in the video are as good as in her classes for a vigorous workout and stretch.,1360195200,,195,4.27027027027027
8553990,5,B00AMQI572,"I have the pleasure and privilege of practicing under Aparna for both yoga and meditation. Her DVDs are spot on with her informative, compassionate and unpretentious teaching style that I so enjoy in-person. I first used the Yoga Therapy for the Upper Body DVD after a 13+ hour drive for the holidays! It was a relief in so many ways for my tense back, shoulders and neck. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the routines go well beyond stretching to building strength and increasing range of motion, as well. After such a long trip, I was finding myself a little frustrated with the inflexibility of my body relative to how it usually is. It was really funny, though. Aparna has a way of bringing students back into the moment and gently reminding us to accept ourselves, wherever we are in that moment on that particular day. It was like she was reading my mind! There were a couple of moments like that, when I'd have to laugh because it was like she was catching me getting onto myself instead of having compassion for myself.

Through my customary yoga practice, I know my body is becoming more flexible and stronger than it was before. However, this focused yoga therapy (both for the upper body AND lower body) has really shown me that there's untapped potential if I am patient and use these exercises to increase strength and flexibility in parts of my body that are not as targeted in a general practice. For example, Aparna guides you through these incredible shoulder openers! I didn't realize what I was missing in my shoulders... Now, I look forward to some really amazing triangles and wild things in my future! Whether you're new to yoga and really looking to ease your pain or you're a long-time yogi, you're sure to find the yoga therapy DVDs beneficial to your practice. The meditations are also incredibly helpful, too. For me, at least, they increase my capacity to be really committed to my intention for the practice and to be more mindful and compassionate with myself. Om and namaste",1356998400,,2012,4.69971671388102
8553991,5,B00AMQI572,"I have tried many Yoga upper body specialized DVD's, and have had various issues with my shoulders. After trying this DVD, not only did I have relief in my left shoulder, I have greater strength and awareness in both my shoulders which has allowed my practice to become more fluid and safe at the same time. The DVD is very easy to follow, and on different days, depending on what I'm feeling in my body, I use one of the three different sequences. I love that I can explore various levels that focus on the upper body in so many ways! I can't express how amazing this DVD has been for helping the health of my shoulders, upper back, and neck. Very highly recommended!",1356825600,2,668,4.395161290322581
