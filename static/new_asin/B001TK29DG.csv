8341740,2,B001TK29DG,"I'm not a film snob, but this was the worst movie ever.  The main actor was good looking, but couldn't keep his accent straight.  The female lead was too old to be his girlfriend.  The story had a point, but they oversimplified.  The supporting parts were just ridiculously over-acted.  Can I get my money back?",1357948800,,311,4.581818181818182
