8575864,5,B00BZLXY1A,"This was my very first documentary about Graf Zeppelin dirigibles. I like the fact that it is German made DVD with an option to choose either German language narration (makes it more authentic) or English one. Both narrations are very good! The movie was produced in 1996 and is 50-min long. It is a balanced introduction to the great German airships of the early 20th century. There is a brief coverage of the airship history and the Count (Graf) Ferdinand von Zeppelin himself and his early pioneer zeppelins built on Bodensee (Lake Constance). Then the focus is on the Graf LZ127, including its first ever around-the-world flight in 1929 and transatlanic passenger service. Dr. Hugo Eckener, who led the Zeppelin enterprise from mid 1910's to early 1930's, is also featured. There is a footage of Hidenburg LZ129 airship, its Nazi propaganda flights and tragic end from hydrogen explosion in 1937. The prior LZ126, that was commissioned to the US, and the very last, most advanced large dirigible, LZ130 (Graf Zeppelin II)  is shown briefly. The movie ends shortly after the Hindenburg disaster, which is just a little cushioned by the nostalgic memory of the past ""great airships"" that afforded an opportunity for a comfortable air travel. This was contrasted in the beginning of the movie with mass transit in cramped spaces of modern passenger planes for the sake or speed and efficiency. The movie is well balanced for its length and is great introduction to great airships of the past. A small modern German helium-filled zeppelin for pleasure flights at Friedrichshafen is featured in the very beginning. I wish there would be more details, and, perhaps, future prospects of airships (from tourism industry to even exploration of Venus!) are presented, but this is sure out of the scope of this movie. I have to mention that this PAL DVD did not play in my multi-region Philips DVD player for some reason, but it did play on my computer with a Pioneer Blu-Ray player/recorder. I don't want to lower the rating for any system incompatibility as there is a way around. I highly recommend this DVD documentary as an intro to the Graf Zeppelin and other great historic German airships, especially if like a choice of both German and English narration, both are excellent. I also suggest to pair this movie with the excellent book ""Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine"".",1486166400,,2365,4.942211055276382
