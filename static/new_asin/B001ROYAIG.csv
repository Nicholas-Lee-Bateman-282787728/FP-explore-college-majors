8459949,5,B001ROYAIG,"I love this instructional video.  Aswathy is very clear in her instruction and she and her dancers are beautiful and graceful.  It is challenging to learn as a dance form and has helped me to think of my movements whilst moving through everyday life.
I hope that in the future there will be a choreography dvd to continue instruction and to put all of the steps together. ?

Thank you very much.",1427414400,,395,4.458333333333333
8459950,4,B001ROYAIG,"The first package that I got was broken. The CD was cracked but the crack was not visible until you looked really closely or tried to play it :-)I returned it but Amazon credited me the $10 or so for being a regular customer.
I almost broke the second one trying to get it out of the package. The central plastic hub with spokes on which the CD sits is waaay too tight. Take your time to release the DVD from its central hub.

Aswathy has done an amazing job not just for folks who want an introduction to Mohiniattam but also for folks like me who want to refresh their training from yesteryears.
A good addition would have been names of mandala's, pada bheda's, chari's etc as well as the Do's and Don'ts. For eg., don't turn your head sideways in count 4 of Jaganam or something on those lines.
Practice audio tracks would have added to the usefulness of the purchase. Individual tracks in 3 speeds that you can loop for practice. Overall Great Purchase!",1353888000,,957,4.406779661016949

8459952,5,B001ROYAIG,I was working on a book about India and I got the idea of seeing what I had been writing about.  This video breaks down the basic movements of the divine dance Mohiniyattam.  Aswathy Srikanth explains the dance movements with efficient grace.,1291766400,,242,4.738095238095238
