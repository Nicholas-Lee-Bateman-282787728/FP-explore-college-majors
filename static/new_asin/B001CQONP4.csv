8288904,5,B001CQONP4,"7th Heaven is one of the most beautiful heartwarming experiences I've seen on television.  The portrayal of a family growing up reaffirms the values that we try to instill in our own families.  Every character in the show is someone we know or may well be a member of our own family.  How they create (and solve) their problems is not only very entertaining and often hilarious, but also acknowledges the importance of family in our lives.",1252713600,,439,4.675324675324675
