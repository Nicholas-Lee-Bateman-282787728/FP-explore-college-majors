3559290,5,B001F0TT88,They are hilarious my children love these movies. And if you are going to buy it. Get it from OddBannana. They were shipped very fast. You'll enjoy the movies. I love them too.,1243814400,,176,4.363636363636363
3559291,5,B001F0TT88,I am huge Wallace and Gromit fan and the type of antimation used to produce their films.  Shaun the Sheep most definitely lived up to my expectations.  It now ranks among my favorites claymation animations!,1239321600,,206,4.857142857142857
3559292,5,B001F0TT88,"SO AWESOME!  I love having them.  Our 3 and 4 year olds both love them, and I think my husband and I may love them even MORE! Shaun the Sheep is new to me.  I love it!",1237680000,,167,3.4594594594594597
3559293,5,B001F0TT88,"We first saw Shaun the Sheep on Disney and our son (one year old at the time) loved it so much we bought the DVD set from Amazon UK and a Region Free DVD player just so he could watch it.  He's almost 2 1/2 now and still loves it.  He recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!",1234483200,,339,3.9705882352941178
3559294,5,B001F0TT88,"For all lover's of Shaun, this is the best collection to purchase. ""Off the BAA"" is a collection of Shaun and his farm friends up to hijinx and mayhem. From an escape from the farm to get out of being sheared to a hilarious soccer game. For over 15 years, I've been waiting to have another Shaun adventure, and this was a bonanza.
The other DVD is a trio of Gromit and his hapless owner Wallace. A trip to the moon for cheese, a criminal mastermind of a penguin and finally our first introduction of my personal hero....Shaun, who has been kiddnaped by ruthless sheep shearers. Laugh and root for the good guys!!!",1231804800,,613,4.433628318584071

8300313,5,B001F0TT88,"There's nobody else like Wallace and Gromit, and this proves it. The first three animated shorts of the legendary duo on one set. Admittedly ""A Grand Day Out"" hasn't aged especially gracefully but it's still wonderful to see those early days. The bonus inclusion of ""Shaun the Sheep"" is an unexpected treat, and a great way to follow up from ""A Close Shave.""",1385078400,,358,4.698412698412699
8300314,5,B001F0TT88,"I love Nick Parks's sensibility and admire the craftsmanship that goes into these films.

Very interesting to see the original 3  Wallace and Gromit films and the development of style that plays out in the feature films and Chicken Run.

Shaun the Sheep was just the thing to inspire some kids in the neighborhood to do their own simple animation project.",1379808000,,355,4.786885245901639
8300315,5,B001F0TT88,If you enjoy Wallace and Gromit you'll love these shorts. Shaun the Sheep is the cutest and his friends are just as hilarious. Watch it just to feel better on a blue day!,1277424000,,170,4.181818181818182
8300316,5,B001F0TT88,My family and I enjoy Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit. Very clever and creative.,1276041600,,87,4.5
8300317,5,B001F0TT88,"What's not to love about Shaun the Sheep?  If these clips can't make you smile, you're hopeless :)  We had not seen Shaun and thought it would be fun if it came from Nick Park, so we got the package.  We've only watched this on an 'old' TV, so no comments from us yet on the widescreen viewing.",1264550400,,294,4.0344827586206895
8300318,5,B001F0TT88,"Funny, charming, something to enjoy for all ages.  I love Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit.  These are the cartoons that will last for ever, since they are not trendy superheros fighting good & evil, and they are funny.  Just watched with my nieces and nephews, and all of us from age 53 to the tender age of 2 enjoyed.",1253664000,,325,4.295081967213115
8300319,5,B001F0TT88,A good price on the two bundled DVDs.  Shaun and Wallace and Gromit are delightful and recommeded for any age viewer.,1250553600,,117,4.571428571428571
