8388421,4,B0034KVTOO,"A fun, if off-beat satire of the 'superhero' genre.  I actually know ""Reverend Jen"" personally, as I have attended many of her famous 'open mike' shows.  I was even an extra in two episodes!  :-)",1426809600,,195,4.514285714285714
8388422,5,B0034KVTOO,"Saw Electra Elf (and Fluffer) on Public Access when I lived in New York.  It's campy, crass, opinionated, and a reflection of its time.  Most episodes were a hoot.  This is probably the best Public Access show I ever saw (together with Mystery Science Theatre 3000).  And Rev Jen is a real person I used to see here and there on the LES, in New York.  More superheroes should have a sidekick like fluffer.

Pop some corn and enjoy.",1396310400,,431,4.3924050632911396
8388423,1,B0034KVTOO,"Had no idea it was going to be an excuse for Liberal propagandizing and the hate George Bush crowd.  Then I found out it was from
New York so it made sense.  What could have been a fun and campy idea turned into vomit material.  I through it out with the trash not even the ""recycle"".",1393891200,2,284,4.035714285714286
8388424,5,B0034KVTOO,"This DVD-set offers an immense viewing experience that will seriously challenge everyones perception of the superhero-genre, which has been prevalent throughout western history from Jesus Christ to Superman. In this explosive and thoroughly entertaining series the Superhero is a woman called Jennifer Swallows by day, but transform into the amazing Electra Elf when the situation acquiers it.

This DVD-box offers 20 mindblowing episodes + a ton of bonus features.

Be prepared for some truly subversive art that completely smashes the hegemonical cultural boundaries!
It's absolutely hilarious as well!

A great buy!!!",1284681600,8,620,5.791208791208791
8388425,5,B0034KVTOO,"This show was on NYC public access, extremely low budget, and extremely bad. However it is in that ""So bad it's good"" category. If you are going to see this I recommend get at least 4 other people to watch it with to make jokes while the movie plays.

Nazi Frog will destroy you all!!!",1281657600,7,285,4.181818181818182
