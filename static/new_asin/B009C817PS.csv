5315337,5,B009C817PS,What a hilarious and entertaining movie.  I saw it at a pre-screening and thought it was really well done.  I cant wait to see the movie again.,1361664000,3,143,4.2592592592592595
5315338,4,B009C817PS,It is hard to find a good Lesbian movie. Seems like formulas. This was sweet. Guess we all want to write our own movies.,1369872000,,120,4.041666666666667
5315339,4,B009C817PS,"I'm a lesbian... from Iowa even.  Apparently this movie was filmed IA but I had no idea until I came here to purchase it and read one of the reviews.  I originally watched it on Netflix.  I liked it pretty well and feel it was well done.  One of the main characters is perhaps a little too quirky for me and if you're looking for a lesbian romance movie, this ain't it.  But I did enjoy it.  I recommend viewing it first if you can before buying it because I can see where some might not care for it.

The thing that really bothers me is as I write this review there are ten 5 star reviews and one 1 star review. Pretty suspicious I thought since I couldn't personally imagine people would be rating this movie as highly as that overall.  I checked the other reviewers and over half have only reviewed one item on Amazon, this movie.  Ugh.  Stuffing the ballot box which is unfortunate.  So beware, don't trust the ratings given for this movie here.  Do a little research elsewhere.",1368748800,26,982,4.306010928961749
5315340,5,B009C817PS,I thought that Molly's Girl was great!  The theme and message was clear and well presented.  I thought all the actors did a wonderful job.  I was fun to see Ellen Dolan on screen again.  She is truly a gifted actress!  Good job all!,1367712000,,232,4.181818181818182
5315341,5,B009C817PS,"I saw this film at the Julien Dubuque International Film Festival and I absolutely loved it! Molly's Girl was a totally amazing film! I felt really connected to Molly's character, as someone who's always danced to the beat of her own drum, it was so refreshing to see characters who embrace who they really are.",1365292800,2,311,4.672727272727273
5315342,5,B009C817PS,Just saw this at the local Film Festival. This is a very well made movie. Great acting. Great Soundtrack. Buy or rent this movie you won't be disappointed.,1365206400,,155,4.571428571428571
5315343,1,B009C817PS,"Being a lesbian with a sense of humor, I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  Based upon the rave reviews, I almost purchased it.  Erring on the side of caution (having been burned before by over-rated lesbian films) I decided to watch it on Netflix first, and am so glad that I did.  Although I won't get back the 2 hours of my life that I wasted watching Molly's Girl, at least I saved the 20 bucks that I would've otherwise spent on this dreadfully dull movie.",1364947200,7,478,4.348314606741573
5315344,5,B009C817PS,"I was recommended this film, and I am so glad, what a wonderful find!

Beautiful story, acting and scenery. Took me away like all great films do...",1364256000,,147,4.444444444444445
5315345,5,B009C817PS,"An extremely fun find! - funny, poignant and extremely well acted! Nice to see Ellen Dolan in a different role after watching her for years on As The World Turns&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Molly-s-Girl/dp/B00BDTSLEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Molly's Girl</a>",1364169600,,307,8.058823529411764
5315346,5,B009C817PS,"This is a delightful movie that touches the whole range of emotions.

The team who put this film together really got it right.  The performances were real and top notch and drew every bit of emotion without being sappy or preachy.  Molly's relationship with her mother (played by the amazing Ellen Dolan of As The World Turns) was especially well played.

While there is a beginning, middle and end to the film, they filmmakers left it open - Molly's story is not over and everything is not tied up with a neat ribbon at the end - just like life.

Oh, and the music...the music is amazing.

Well done on all counts.",1364169600,,615,4.446428571428571
5315347,5,B009C817PS,"I saw this film several times at test screenings, and I cannot wait to own it on DVD!  Molly is an unforgettable character that I wish I could meet in real life.

8539504,2,B009C817PS,"This movie is horrible by almost any movie evaluating criteria one might choose.  My friends abandoned me after the first hour and refused to watch the rest.  They are still making fun it.  As a previous reviewer has noted, many of the five star reviews of this film are suspicious.  Five star films are magnificent works of art.  This film is a valiant attempt at art that utterly fails.

Screenplay -- the writing for this film is simply awful.  Some of the scenes are absolutely ludicrous.  As I was watching I was having a hard time imagining that an adult wrote this film instead of some middle school kid who secretly aspires to be a screen writer.  There is no other way to describe the writing except juvenile, naive, and sophomoric.  The dialogue is contrived, stiff, clunky.  Parts of the plot are so silly that calling them unbelievable is an understatement.  In the beginning of the film, Mercedes is one hour late for a meeting with the Senator [a meeting which is unlikely in the first place] and the Senator waits one hour for her at her office.  Scenes like this make me wonder if the writer is really a grownup.

Acting -- The acting is soooooo bad that it is painful at points. Either lines are delivered mechanically, robotically, or the scene is tritely over-acted.  Facial expressions do not match the emotion that is supposed to be conveyed or they do so in a way that caricatures the emotion instead of conveying it.

Plot -- Well, I admit that the plot was not formulaic.  I could not imagine where the story was going to go.  This was more a result of the nonsensical, unrealistic progression of the story than a result of clever, suspense building plot development.

Character development -- there was none.  whoever wrote this movie has a terrible sense of human psychology. Most compulsive liars tell believable lies.  Molly is a compulsive liar who tells unbelievable, transparent lies and seems to be completely unaware of how people respond to her lies.  By any account, someone with Molly's personality and behavioral habits would be considered mentally ill.  Despite the fact that Molly's character is the one that is most developed, the character is unrealistic and shallow.

The Mercedes character is almost incomprehensible.  She's devoted to social justice for LGBT people, yet is uncritically unethical -- using mental ill Molly to pursue her ends.  She's detached in a way that is reminiscent of a psychopath.  She seems to not have any sort of moral compass or sense of social diplomacy, yet we are to believe that she is committed to social justice and has risen to a leadership position.

The central theme of the film is the only thing that merits attention:  being invisible is worse than being ignored. [At least that is what I gleaned, though it's possible that I am giving the writer too much credit].  Unfortunately, so much of this film was so poorly executed [especially the screenplay] that the theme lacks cohesion.  This movie is like looking at six year's old drawing of a cat.  You know he was trying to draw a cat-- you can tell by the ears -- but it's a terrible drawing.",1417996800,2,3128,4.724584103512015
8539505,5,B009C817PS,"The movie was very enjoyable.....very good cast (especially for a small studio production)
Quirky and funny, relavent issues without being preachy.....no over-the-top stereotypes,
and likeable characters.  No nudity or explicit scenes, and will appeal to straight, as well as gay
viewers......It's a romantic sit-com for the ""modern era"".",1384473600,,338,6.041666666666667
8539506,3,B009C817PS,"I found Molly exausting. And she was there through the whole movie. A very American way of seeing the world, I am a Scandinave, and thus it`s not quite within my comprehention. But the film was nice enough if you like people scrambling over each other to reach a goal. Now all the phsycoligy - to me rather shallow - . How can grown women not have a clue ??? Again - it might be an American thing. I enjoyed the film, but will probably never see it again.",1381536000,6,455,4.123595505617978
8539507,4,B009C817PS,"Molly's character is truly just a lovable loony, the movie in itself is enjoyable and entertaining; while having some serious and very relevent themes and social statements and undertones.",1374624000,,188,5.517241379310345
8539508,4,B009C817PS,"Not your """"I can't think straight"" or ""perfect ending"" but great quality production wise, good enough script, catchy and best of all it's funny! I watched it twice lesbian or not you can enjoy this film! Molly brings a laugh to every scene and it touches on some struggles we may have in life!",1373760000,,293,4.444444444444445

The music is quite wonderful too.",1370649600,,134,5.090909090909091
