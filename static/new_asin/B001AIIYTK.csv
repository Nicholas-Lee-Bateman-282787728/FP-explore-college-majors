8331915,5,B001AIIYTK,"i goes into really good detail about producing different sounds with Randy Anderson and Primos mouth calls. It elaborates on the different coyote howls and noises. there is good footage of actual hunts. I was a little disappointed because it did not show the use of electronic callers, only Primos brand mouth calls, developed by Randy Anderson. It is a booster movie for their products but well worth it because you can use these sounds on other mouth calls as well. Very informative and I enjoyed it. Randy Anderson is a premiere coyote caller and a very qualified hunter.",1318982400,,574,4.808080808080808
