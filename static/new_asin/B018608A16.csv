8741537,5,B018608A16,"I love these easy going British series. All the Actors were very good. I remember Claire Goose from ""Waking the Dead"".
The views of this English countryside is just breathtakingly beautiful.
Does anyone know is it Devon,Cornwall or Dorset ?
I  have read there is only to be 2 series that is a pity.",1494633600,3,298,4.518518518518518
8741538,5,B018608A16,"I think shrinksix is overly harsh on this series. I am watching it from the U.S. as the DVD set being sold won't run on players here. From the perspective of crime dramas in the U.S., it is a breath of fresh air. Its an entertaining series, where we get to see the cultural quirks of the U.K. that are different from the U.S. to a degree, and its set in a very picturesque seaside town with a leading lady that is much sexier than Jack Klugman was in the U.S. version of a similar series that ran here years ago (Quincy M.E.). LOL I'll take Claire Goose over Jack Klugman any day!

Soooo I await this coming out on DVD or blu-ray that we can actually buy and watch here in the U.S. Come on!",1489449600,10,690,4.073529411764706
8741539,3,B018608A16,"The is an entertaining series but not engrossing. The acting is mediocre, the settings are easy on the eye but the plots are mundane. Overall it is stilted and not up to the usual British crime drama standards.",1460246400,8,210,4.552631578947368
