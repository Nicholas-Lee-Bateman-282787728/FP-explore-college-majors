My son is not old enough to read the Jack London book, but he enjoys this tale of a modern boy and his faithful dog. One thing that irks me is so many of the actors seem to be German and are having problems sounding like rural mountain men. German actors in New Zealand playing mountain men in the Northern Rockies?

Do yourself a favor and purchase Call of the Wild with Shane Meier and Nick Mancuso. TV Series featuring 8 episodes, far better all the way around.",1326844800,,342,4.622950819672131
3144259,4,B0015ET06K,"I didn't expect much from this series, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Original plots? Not Really. How many other shows / movies have there been about a boy and his dog? Plenty (um, remember Lassie?). For these reasons, most people looking for 'serious' entertainment are disappointed in the show. But those people are missing the point: sometimes it is possible (and good) to be entertained by the simple things in life.

The stories move at a nice pace. The Happy Ending is the norm. The acting is very good from all involved, particularly from Jaimz Woolvett, who in this role sounds a lot like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous; set I believe in Montana, the show was actually filmed in New Zealand. Some reviewers have mentioned that the music is a little annoying. The music has that early '90s light rock vibe which I don't mind, though I can see how it could be distracting to some. The show is very clean from a moral standpoint; wholesome family values are the point of most relationships and plots. There is no cursing / sex or anything like that. The level of the writing is probably for kids, ages 9 - 13.

I particularly loved the relationship between the dog and the boy, which isafter all the point of the show, but just as much I liked the relationship the kid has with his parents. There is an attempt to guide, while allowing him to develop as a person, combined with a genuine concern with his welfare. It is the kind of program you might have seen on the Family Channel back in the day, like the New World Zorro series with Duncan Regehr. A great show that provides pleasantly simple entertainment.",1325289600,,1665,4.546666666666667
3144260,1,B0015ET06K,"I purchased this at a local store for $5, so I can't complain about the price too much. But I would certainly not pay more than that for this series. As another reviewer stated, the music is just horrible! The plots have no depth, and are so short that really not much happens, and what does happen is predictable. Some of the plots had potential if they had been longer. Sometimes the acting is a little too obvious and not very realistic.

Also, this has nothing to do with Jack London's book. The only similarity is the name of the dog.

I would recommend this instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-the-Wild-Complete-Series/dp/B003ZVJFEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of the Wild-Complete Series</a>&nbsp;It, too, has nothing to do with Jack London's book, but the story is much better.",1317859200,,845,5.59375

3144266,1,B0015ET06K,I thought this was the story version of White Fang which it wasn't. This was the TV series so I can't use it in my classroom so I had to go back and purchase the correct video.,1240185600,,176,3.7837837837837838
3144267,4,B0015ET06K,"White Fang the series is yet another retelling of Jack London's famous book of the same name. Whereas the book tells about White Fang in the roll of a sled dog living in the Klondike gold rush years, this series moves the story to current times in the Rocky mountains and adds the inevitable 'boy and his loyal dog' twist to the concept. About the only similarities are White Fang's name and that he was rescued from a cruel man called Beauty Smith.
Why T.V. producers can't seem to come up with an original show with a dog hero and not just reuse a well known story is beyond me. Anyway, White Fang sports fairly good acting, beautiful scenery, and a terrible soundtrack. If you can get over the music, this show is enjoyable in its own right. White Fang is an Alaskan malamute (although they portray him as the stereotypical ""wolfdog"") who exhibits extraordinary good sense and often rescues his not so bright family from danger with fairly standard hero-dog skills like rescuing drowning people, fending off ""wolves"" (other malamutes in makeup) and locating important clues at crime scenes. Although the plot lines are simplistic, this is nicely balanced by a lack of gore and swearing, making it acceptable family viewing.
If you are nuts about Nordic breeds and will watch anything featuring them, this show is for you. Others may want to avoid this particular series.",1225670400,,1373,4.773109243697479
3144268,1,B0015ET06K,"So many translations of White Fang are awful, and this one is the worst of them all! Garishly bright colors and extremely poor animation make it an eyesore and the plot (such as it is) varies so greatly from the original as to be an almost separate story. Everything about White Fang's abusive puppy hood and dog sledding history is neglected, with much of the focus being on a young Native American boy who is his best friend. Anyone who has read the book will know such a thing is laughable. Although the creators of this movie were trying to tone down the violence of an admittedly violent story, I felt that the result was condescending to children's intelligence. No narration and little dialog made the drag even more noticeable. Even though the DVD cover is cute, it houses a dull and lifeless movie.",1204761600,,807,4.611111111111111

3378756,4,B0015ET06K,"I didn't expect much from this series, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Original plots? Not Really. How many other shows / movies have there been about a boy and his dog? Plenty (um, remember Lassie?). For these reasons, most people looking for 'serious' entertainment are disappointed in the show. But those people are missing the point: sometimes it is possible (and good) to be entertained by the simple things in life.

The stories move at a nice pace. The Happy Ending is the norm. The acting is very good from all involved, particularly from Jaimz Woolvett, who in this role sounds a lot like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous; set I believe in Montana, the show was actually filmed in New Zealand. Some reviewers have mentioned that the music is a little annoying. The music has that early '90s light rock vibe which I don't mind, though I can see how it could be distracting to some. The show is very clean from a moral standpoint; wholesome family values are the point of most relationships and plots. There is no cursing / sex or anything like that. The level of the writing is probably for kids, ages 9 - 13.

I particularly loved the relationship between the dog and the boy, which isafter all the point of the show, but just as much I liked the relationship the kid has with his parents. There is an attempt to guide, while allowing him to develop as a person, combined with a genuine concern with his welfare. It is the kind of program you might have seen on the Family Channel back in the day, like the New World Zorro series with Duncan Regehr. A great show that provides pleasantly simple entertainment.",1325289600,,1665,4.546666666666667
3378757,1,B0015ET06K,"I purchased this at a local store for $5, so I can't complain about the price too much. But I would certainly not pay more than that for this series. As another reviewer stated, the music is just horrible! The plots have no depth, and are so short that really not much happens, and what does happen is predictable. Some of the plots had potential if they had been longer. Sometimes the acting is a little too obvious and not very realistic.

Also, this has nothing to do with Jack London's book. The only similarity is the name of the dog.

I would recommend this instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-the-Wild-Complete-Series/dp/B003ZVJFEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of the Wild-Complete Series</a>&nbsp;It, too, has nothing to do with Jack London's book, but the story is much better.",1317859200,,845,5.59375

3378763,1,B0015ET06K,I thought this was the story version of White Fang which it wasn't. This was the TV series so I can't use it in my classroom so I had to go back and purchase the correct video.,1240185600,,176,3.7837837837837838
3378764,4,B0015ET06K,"White Fang the series is yet another retelling of Jack London's famous book of the same name. Whereas the book tells about White Fang in the roll of a sled dog living in the Klondike gold rush years, this series moves the story to current times in the Rocky mountains and adds the inevitable 'boy and his loyal dog' twist to the concept. About the only similarities are White Fang's name and that he was rescued from a cruel man called Beauty Smith.
Why T.V. producers can't seem to come up with an original show with a dog hero and not just reuse a well known story is beyond me. Anyway, White Fang sports fairly good acting, beautiful scenery, and a terrible soundtrack. If you can get over the music, this show is enjoyable in its own right. White Fang is an Alaskan malamute (although they portray him as the stereotypical ""wolfdog"") who exhibits extraordinary good sense and often rescues his not so bright family from danger with fairly standard hero-dog skills like rescuing drowning people, fending off ""wolves"" (other malamutes in makeup) and locating important clues at crime scenes. Although the plot lines are simplistic, this is nicely balanced by a lack of gore and swearing, making it acceptable family viewing.
If you are nuts about Nordic breeds and will watch anything featuring them, this show is for you. Others may want to avoid this particular series.",1225670400,,1373,4.773109243697479
3378765,1,B0015ET06K,"So many translations of White Fang are awful, and this one is the worst of them all! Garishly bright colors and extremely poor animation make it an eyesore and the plot (such as it is) varies so greatly from the original as to be an almost separate story. Everything about White Fang's abusive puppy hood and dog sledding history is neglected, with much of the focus being on a young Native American boy who is his best friend. Anyone who has read the book will know such a thing is laughable. Although the creators of this movie were trying to tone down the violence of an admittedly violent story, I felt that the result was condescending to children's intelligence. No narration and little dialog made the drag even more noticeable. Even though the DVD cover is cute, it houses a dull and lifeless movie.",1204761600,,807,4.611111111111111

I would highly recommend this series to families who want a good show that they can watch together.
