8495837,5,B006AUZY3M,"So I've just started pole dancing almost two months ago, and I can definitively say that this will be an obsession for years to come!!  Ha! It's been a while since a pastime has been so enrapturing/sexy/thrilling/scary/challenging/frustrating/rewarding!

Pole dance is all about femininity, strength, artistic expression and FLEXIBILITY, and though I've always been a quite flexible person thanks to my fitness/yoga lifestyle, good pole performance requires you to take your flexibility to a level beyond the average.  The very supportive :-)  boyfriend gifted me a home pole recently, so I started looking for DVDs that used the pole for fitness and skill training.

I came across this one, and though there weren't many reviews, I Googled Alethea Austin, LOVED what I saw and purchased the 2-pack consisting of this and ""Pure Splits"" (as of this date I have yet to try that one...will exhaust/memorize this and then do that one).

If you are newly into Pole and have not yet heard of Alethea Austin, you MUST check her out.  She is an incredibly talented, skilled dancer with a very unique style.  She is amazing to watch, exhibits incredible athleticism and, in this DVD, can definitely increase your flexibility and add to your repertoire of moves if you are a beginner.

The production value of the DVD is good, consisting of Alethea addressing the camera directly in intros to each chapter, and then doing the stretches while she does a voiceover.  The whole program is about an hour long.  Most of the exercises are floor stretches, and then about 3/4 of the way in you stretch on the pole.

You begin with a warmup consisting of sexy hip rolls and plies, and then progress to arm holds, side lunges, shoulder rolls, etc.  The warmup is pretty thorough, and like Alethea mentions, you can use her warmup and continue on to the whole DVD OR use it as a prelude to other pole work/skills training/conditioning, whatever, which is definitely what I plan to do.

You then move on to leg flexibility by doing straddles, hamstring stretches and a challenging split series on your back using both passive holds and active, muscle-firing stretches (TOUGH for me right now, esp. on one side!).  Like practically all top-echelon pole dancers, her flexibility is awe-inspiring, but everyone has to start somewhere, and with work, we all can get there!  :-) I have done her workout just a few times now, and I can already feel a slightly greater range of flexibility in my back straddles especially.

The best part of this is when she moves to the pole and teaches you stretches that you can actually incorporate into dance.  She shows this with a ""Freedance"" chapter at the end of the DVD that is incredible.  It is very stylistically shot, in black-and-white, sepia tones and lots of shadow, and actually contains more floorwork and stretch poses than real pole tricks.  Yet, it's absolutely captivating to watch and shows you that aerial tricks are kick-@$$, yes, but you don't need to perform a lot of those to make a great dance.

Alethea's style is a bit different...It reminds me of Southern rock-glam-trailer-stripper-goddess!  She's got several tats, including a big one that says ""Heartland"" across her stomach, and she clearly is a fan of rock music. She is edgy and VERY racy, which is a style that I would love to learn from!  (Check out her website...There is a video on there called ""Thirteen"" that is weird, wild and shows you how creative she is and how crazy good she is on a pole...I mean, dancing with a bottle of Jack?  Doing a split on the ceiling?  REALLY??  She's f-ing bad.)  You may or may not appreciate the music for a stretching DVD, as its hard rock, and usually stretching DVDs use softer music.  Personally, I prefer RnB, hip hop, New Age, dubstep, EDM...pretty much anything but rock LOL! but I love most types of music and can appreciate her choices here.  It's different.

So, solid pole stretching DVD. She has shown me ways to improve my flexibility AND has given me several new sexy poses to throw into my freestyle sessions! Issues:  As with most stretching DVDs, she holds the stretches for a certain, short-ish amount of time, I think 30 seconds, but tells you that if you want to hold it longer, you can do that, so you'd either have to pause the DVD or do longer versions of some of the more challenging stretches on your own time, like while watching a movie, which is what I do.  Why not? :-)  Also, she doesn't talk  much even in the voiceover nor does she smile/exude warmth hardly at all, which will either make you happy or seem weird.  But you get a lot of the music, which is good if you like it. Also, as a lot of the stretches are done in silence, she does not cue when you should come out of the stretch or switch sides, something which I think of as the Tracy Anderson disorder. :-) I'm not psychic!  There is sometimes a verbal countdown for holding the stretches, but this is curiously inconsistent.

I am enjoying and benefiting from this and look forward to other releases from her!",1425513600,,5036,4.701254275940707
8495838,5,B006AUZY3M,"This is a pretty good stretching DVD. Alethea basically does a warm up consisting of body, arm and shoulder rolls and hip swirls from then on she explains and demonstrates several types of stretches including static, active and ballistic. The only thing that looked really painful was the ballistic drop and other ballistic stretches. Afterwards, she utilizes the pole in her stretches. Near the end she does some of her signature stretches that look really hot and also has a pole freedance routine that incorporate her stretches. The most beneficial part of the DVD, for me, was the pole stretches. Some of the stretching moves she used on the pole really help the stiffness and soreness in my arms and back after being on the pole for a while. Honestly, I am really not into stretching at all. I am pretty flexible anyway. I just bought this DVD out of curiosity and the fact that I am totally in awe with Alethea, however, this dvd was intriguing enough to make me want to do a few of the stretches she was demonstrating. As far as the production quality, It's ok given this is her first DVD. But it's still very professional. I'm sure her newer ones like Sexy Fundamentals and Floor Work are a lot better.... Speaking of which, I hope she gets Sexy Fundamentals and Floor Work on Amazon reallly sooon! Also, she doesn't do that much talking... Only when it's necessary and I like that. When she isn't talking there is some music playing in the background. The music is ok.. lol a little weird.. But a good dvd if you want to learn new stretches or just if you are into pole and an Alethea Fan.. I love it!",1340841600,,1610,4.517123287671233
