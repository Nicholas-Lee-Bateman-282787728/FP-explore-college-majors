8113194,5,B000EQ8OIK,"Ryan Leech is the man! This video is all you need to get started doing trials. I've been using it for about 6 months now. It's absolutely fantastic. I would suggest this movie to everyone into trials (and even biking). Trials improves your balance and is a great spin on traditional bicycling. There are tips for mountain biking too. This video will improve you over all as a biker, not just in trials. Not only is the video completely informative, but it's very inspiring. It starts with simple tricks and moves into more advanced progressively. There are basically two movies here too. A series of videos from Ryan Leech and the main feature. If I could give more stars, I would. Absolutely fantastic!",1271635200,,703,4.723577235772358
8113195,5,B000EQ8OIK,I've read many books on mountain biking.  Failed so many times in my attempt to learn the holy bunny hop.  The sport is just too dynamic to learn from books.  This dvd is exactly what you need to learn the coveted bunny hop so start your mtn biking days the right way and never dismount from your bike again when you see logs in your path!,1208390400,3,339,4.106060606060606
8113196,5,B000EQ8OIK,For anyone starting trials this is a must.  Ryan explains in detail all the steps needed to get out and start riding.  A great DVD.,1178928000,,131,4.2
