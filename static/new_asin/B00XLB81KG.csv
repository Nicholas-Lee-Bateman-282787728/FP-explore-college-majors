7170897,4,B00XLB81KG,"'Victors write history' how true.
At least they tried to be a bit more fair than the Monday Night War dvd by adding Bischoff's interviews after each segment which upraded this dvd as a whole but is still biased. Let me go into details per each segment.

episode 11 - Monday Night Jericho
a fairly descriptive segment regarding the Lionheart. I am not sure whether Jericho really means it when he says 'WCW was a stepping stone for WWE' or 'although I was working for WCW, I was cheering for WWE'. Yes, he did not get over in WCW so he went to WWE, but so did many people the other way. Lex Luger never became a champion in WWE so he returned to WCW to become, what, 4-time champion?
Eric Bischoff admits that Jericho was not on top of his list of main eventers and lets it go there.

episode 12 - The War Gets Extreme
Why does WWE keep on repeating Heyman's words that 'WCW raided ECW'? So did WWE as they quietly admit in this segment. WWE took away Taz, Dudleyz, Mikey Lockwood, and so many more. I sympathize very much with Bischoff's comments.
""I did not even look at ECW's products."" or ""I can understand why Paul Heyman wants to or even needs to believe...""

episode 13 - The War Gets Electrified
Yeah, yeah, WWE ran with the Rock to the top, very top. But I am not convinced whether he deserved an entire episode to himself. Yes, he was a soldier in the war but he never experienced both sides and left almost immediately following the war.  Before the Rock became the Rock, WCW would not have been interested in him and by the time Rock became the Rock, WCW was sinking.

episode 14 - Divas Gone Wild
Yes, yes, the WWE developed their women's division better than WCW but all different promotions have their own focuses. WCW had an amazing cruiserweight division with Eddie Guerrero, Dean Maleknko, Rey Mysterio and so many more when WWE had Michinoku, Gilberg and Grand Master Sexay. So, please, don't try to show your positives only.

episode 15 - The War Goes Mainstream
WWE had Muhammad Ali for their inaugural WrestleMania. WCW brought in Shaquille O'Neal for the 1994 Bash at the Beach. From the way I read it, WCW brought in celebrities on regular basis first and used them more effectively before WWE counterpunched with Mike Tyson. I see it as a draw.

episode 16 - Building An Army
Yes, you cannot run a promotion with only main-eventers. You need strong mid-carders or the backbone of the company. WWE had to develop mid-carders to semi or the main eventers because so many had left for WCW. WCW had a stronger backbone since theirs included names such as Booker T, Scott Steiner, Lex Luger, and so forth. Yes, I do hear the criticism but I only saw them as semi main-eveters at best.

episode 17 - The Kliq
Oh, I get so sick of hearing the name. Sure, they were five friends who supposedly shared strong and true bonds among them. Save that for a soap opera. The Kliq north created DX and Kliq south the nWo. That's it. Are we supposed to be emtionally moved by their supposedly never-ending friendship acorss the trenches?

episode 18 - Mistakes in the Battlefield
Why doesn't WWE be candid enough to name this episode 'WCW's mistakes' as they do not mention theirs at all. I've got two words for you - Owen Hart. It is the greatest mistake any promotion has ever made in professional wrestling history. They convinced unwilling Owen to do the stunt because they wanted to mimick Sting's drop from a helicopter. Another two words? Montreal screwjob. If WCW had been clever enough to capitalize on that mistake, WWE would have been out of business as everyone thought so then.

episode 19 - The Fall of WCW
If you ever read Eric Bischoff's book, it gives a logical reason to the demise of WCW. The wrestlers talk about guaranteed contracts, creative controls, backstage politics which is very similar to employees of a company complaining. Bischoff talks about the AOL-Turner merger, standards and practices set by (I suspect) idiotic lawyers, and no funding for Thunder. Take the one that suits you. I am going with Bischoff's explanation.

episode 20 - Life After Wartime
Life goes so, and show must go on. Let us give dues where they are due. Without WCW, they would be no live episodes of Raw, no monthly pay-per-views, and so many characteristics that we take for granted now. Without WCW, we would have no nostalgia of the nWo, cruiserweights, or Harlem Heat.

In all summary, I was much happier to see this dvd than how I felt when I saw the Monday Night War dvd, but when are we ever going to see a dvd that at least attempts to be fair?",1442880000,3,4565,4.513317191283293
7170898,4,B00XLB81KG,"""The Monday Night War"" was one of the most anticipated shows by audiences for the WWE Network chronicling the competition between World Wrestling Entertainment & World Championship Wrestling during that period of time over a series of 20 episodes with each one focusing on a specific subject or superstar involved throughout that time period.  This volume is the second half of the series (10 episodes) that features various interviews from talent & management who were involved or fans of that period of time time including C.M. Punk, John Cena, Jerry Lawler, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie, Shane), Michael Hayes, Hulk Hogan, Michael Cole, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Kevin Nash, Daniel Bryan, Booker T, Gene Okerland, Tony Schiavone, ex-Turner Sports President Dr. Harvey Schiller, Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Diamond Dallas Page, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, Sean Waltman, Jim Ross, Roddy Piper, Vince Russo, Triple H, Scott Hall, The Rock, Paul Heyman, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Steve Austin & others along with archival interview clips from Eric Bischoff & and a 1998 interview with Ted Turner himself that I've never seen before.  While you can get these episodes on the WWE Network, the DVD bonus is that each episode contains a new interview with former WCW President Eric Bischoff after each episode discussing the subject at hand.

Episode Eleven: Monday Night Jericho - Chris Jericho is the subject of this episode starting out talking about his early career working all over the world from Mexico to Japan into ECW before coming in WCW as part of the crusierweight division & the issues he had there as a babyface before going into how his heel turn turned his career around but still ran into issues causing him to leave such as what happened when he attempted to work with Goldberg followed by discussing his debut in WWE from how he got the concept of the countdown clock to what issues he had in his first few months causing him to not ""live up to the hype"" only for it to turn around with him opening the doors for others from WCW to jump & be elevated to the main event including him becoming the first Undisputed World Champion in WWE history.

Episode Seven: The War Goes Extreme - The subject that has been downplayed & ignored in previous discussions about the Monday Night War (just look at the previous DVD in 2004) is finally discussed here with the influence that Extreme Championship Wrestling had on the war from how it was an alternative to the other companies by not living in the past & various elements they did to make themselves different which got them noticed by both companies to the point where one man made the statement, ""the nWo was ECW in WCW"" while WWE began a relationship with ECW that caused a change in the WWE product as well followed by the discussion of both companies signing away the talent & how they were used/misused including another talent saying he wanted to go through stacked tables just because he saw it done in ECW before talking about how Mike Awesome caused the only time all three promotions directly interacted with each other, what eventually caused the company to go out of business & the aftermath years later.
It should be noted that this was originally the seventh episode in the series but was moved over to this set replacing the ""Foundations Of War"" episode which is on the previous volume of this set.

Episode Twelve: The War Gets Electrified - ""If you smell..."" what this episode is cooking then you know it's about Dwayne Johnson starting off with how we came at a time where WWE was trying to create their own superstars with details of how WWE heavily hyped the ""Rocky Maivia"" character only for it to fail leading to the steps taken allowing him to show his personality to become The Rock through the Nation Of Domination & The Corporation before going into the significant of his feuds with Mankind & Steve Austin over the WWE Championship followed by talking about his appeal to the audience through his promos & catchphrases such as ""Smack Down"" to his tag team with Mankind & their highest rated segment of ""This Is Your Life"" along with his mainstream crossover ability with movies & television then concluding on his return to WWE after a seven year absence.

Episode Thirteen: Divas Gone Wild - One of the most underrated elements of the war is covered here in the evolution of female talents starting from how female wrestlers were just a special attraction novelty act to them eventually being replaced by valets before going into what Alundra Blayze brought to RAW & the impact she had when she jumped to WCW followed by other female talents before going into the elements of how WWE expanded the role of women from Sunny becoming ""the original diva"" & Chyna being the modern day amazon & Sable's vixen personality to WCW's response of the Nitro Girls & how their women were underutilized followed by discussing more of the females from that era who were made stars with one man saying ""you don't remember Ms. Hancock but you remember Stacy Keibler"" along with Trish & Lita main eventing RAW in a Womens Championship match.

Episode Fourteen: The War Goes Mainstream - Wrestling was never as big during this era as it was before due to the heavy crossover appeal into mainstream media which is covered here from how both companies used celebrities in their product while also used on other television media in their early days but started having more ""closet fans"" than casual due to the directions of the product before discussing the influx of celebrity athletes becoming wrestlers from olympians Kurt Angle & Mark Henry along with UFC fighter Ken Shamrock to Mike Tyson & NBA superstars Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone getting physically involved along with other celebrities to mixed reactions such as Jay Leno before going into how the pop culture appeal expanded to superstars appearing across different types of different types media including The Rock hosting Saturday Night Live while celebrities themselves started appearing at the shows leading to both companies expansions such as book deals & movies leading to the positive & negative effects of David Arquette's infamous WCW Championship reign concluding on how this effected WWE to this day to the point where RAW has gone over 1,000 episodes.

Episode Sixteen: Building An Army - This episode focuses on the rosters & breakout stars from each company starting off with the steps taken to improve the WCW roster in preparation for Nitro while WWE focused on their ""New Generation"" before going into each promotions focusing on creating stars through various groups with the different factions in WWE along with the nWo becoming it's own brand followed by focusing the different cause & effects of decisions made by both companies with WCW creating Thunder & the infamous Halloween Havoc '98 PPV while WWE was creating it's ""Attitude Era"" including launching SmackDown & refocus on their tag team division concluding on the issues in WCW regarding their talent that caused long term effects with how the audience viewed their roster.

Episode Seventeen: The Kliq - The most controversial group of friends possibly in the history of the business is profiled here in this episode focuses on Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman as this episode begins talking about how the group came together & the effect they had both in front of the camera & behind the scenes going into the details & aftermath of the infamous ""curtain call"" leading to The Outsiders coming into WCW & the issues caused there as part of the nWo while Shawn & Hunter formed D-Generation X out of frustration crossing various boundaries with discussion about the similarities & differences between both groups & the mentality had by the Kliq as a group being in different promotions followed by discussion of the events leading to the formation of the new DX & evolution of Triple H along with Nash becoming the booker for WCW before concluding on the aftermath of the Kliq after WCW.

Episode Eighteen: Mistakes On The Battlefield - Eric Bischoff is the subject of this episode starting off as him coming into WCW as an interviewer including never before seen footage of his WWE tryout interviewing a broom while also discussing the issues Ric Flair was having his issues with WCW causing him to leave & the circumstances causing him to return while Bischoff was taking steps to change the image of WCW setting up including signing Hulk Hogan plus other big names leading to Nitro & the tactics used to gain momentum for the show with mistakes being made in regards to not utilizing the talent including Flair who was constantly sacrificed in favor of the nWo along with where the company's focus was & launch of Thunder only caused more problems leading to the lawsuit with Flair & the unprofessional actions by Bischoff before going into the infamous night of ""The Fingerpoke Of Doom"" & Mick Foley's title win that one person perfectly described being the greatest draw for WWE at that time was angry WCW fans who were driven away concluding on how the tactics used to build WCW kept coming back to haunt him along with other issues that eventually led him to be sent home.

Episode Nineteen: The Fall Of WCW - The title itself is self-explanatory about this episode as we start with the introduction of Vince Russo & how we came into the creative side of WWE before going into the circumstances within WCW that led to him coming into the company only to face issues from day one eventually leading to another change in the booking that caused the biggest individual group of talent to jump from one company to the competition eventually leading to the Russo/Bischoff ""reboot"" of WCW but the issues of why it didn't work with not just the audience in front camera but the talent & the individuals themselves behind the scenes such as the infamous Bash At The Beach incident with Hulk Hogan & Vince Russo followed by why Russo's creative ideas just weren't working to the point where they lost $65 million & people to this day think Vince McMahon sent him over to kill off the company with the episode concluding on how the corporate changes within WCW's parent company eventually lead to the end of the company.

Episode Twenty: Life After Wartime - This is the final episode in the series beginning with the discussion of how it went from Eric Bischoff attempting to buy WCW to Vince McMahon doing a simulcast the final edition of WCW Monday Nitro including a funny story of one recently fired WWE talent was attempting to get a job with WCW on that same night not knowing WWE had purchased the company & the irony behind the final match on the show before going into how the infamous ""Invasion"" storyline played out both in front of the camera & behind the scenes within WWE & why it just didn't work followed by looking at the arrival of several key talents from the company coming into the company afterwords including Eric Bischoff himself & how he earned respect from the locker room for his role in the company with the episode concluding on the effect the war had on sports entertainment.

(Blu-Ray) ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Tazz - This is a match that more known for the circumstances surrounding than the actual bell to bell action as this was the only time in history that all three major companies (WWE, WCW, ECW) were involved in the same match as Mike Awesome was the ECW Champion but had signed a contract with WCW but had to lose the championship only for ECW to made a deal to have former ECW Champion & current WWE talent Tazz come in.  The match itself was only around 3 minutes but to see a WCW contracted wrestler face a WWE contracted wrestler for the ECW Championship was history in the making.
""ECW On TNN"" Apr. '00

Other Blu-Ray extras include Hulk Hogan's WCW contract signing parade, Paul Heyman calling into WWE LiveWire, the post WrestleMania XIV press conference with Steve Austin & Mike Tyson, the Bash At The Beach press conference for Hollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Karl Malone, and Scott Steiner's infamous ""WCW sucks"" promo on WCW that caused him to get suspended from television.

I had this before with the first volume of this set in that it's no secret that WWE has had poor revisionist history when it comes to WCW in the past but WWE did a good job in this series spending time on subjects that haven't been talked in as much depth before & were very fair in their discussion on each subject including criticism of their own product & acknowledging their own mistakes with there being better selections for Blu-Ray extras that didn't come off as nothing special & haven't been released in it's entirety before. I have the some of the same criticisms as the first volume in regards to the presentation (once again ignoring the fact that this is another set in regards to WCW that has no representation of the company on the DVD cover) that WWE attempted to stretch this series out so they included episodes on certain people that came off as a reduced one hour version of previous documentaries.  In the end though, I enjoyed the series on the network & the bonus of Eric Bischoff actually contributing to this set with his views & opinions afterwords is a great bonus so this would be a good one to add to the collection right next to volume one.",1438214400,3,13384,4.752151462994837

This is certainly not a ""make or break"" issue and you can easily skip past the recap, but Bischoff is insanely annoying. If someone unfamiliar with the Monday Night Wars was to watch him talk about them, I can see how they might think WCW came out on top... He really loves himself",1512950400,,419,4.3164556962025316
