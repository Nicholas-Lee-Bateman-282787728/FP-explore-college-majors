7156883,1,B00X3DC73E,Biggest waste of $$$ I have spent in some time anywhere!!,1440201600,,57,4.2727272727272725
7156884,1,B00X3DC73E,"It was soooooo bad that I only watched 2 minutes and that was me giving it a second and third chance to get better.
I tried to get a refund but couldnt",1440201600,,151,3.75
7156885,5,B00X3DC73E,"Extremely well done ghost movie.  I have found that the ghost movies from England and Ireland tend to be better and scarier than the ones here.  The story is fantastic and the acting is great.  Don't miss the little tidbit at the end of the credits, it really is the end of the story.",1440028800,2,284,4.222222222222222
7156886,4,B00X3DC73E,"The acting was great. Its a low-budget film but despite that was pretty creepy. Its a good story but lacked big scares and kind of leaves you hanging in the end. Other than that,its finally nice to see a horror movie with good acting for a change.",1439942400,,247,4.276595744680851
7156887,3,B00X3DC73E,"Average or less for the genre... i think it could have been better, but i had trouble relating to characters",1439769600,2,108,4.45
7156888,4,B00X3DC73E,"Not bad. Good pacing, the scares and odd things begin quickly, and the acting is believable. The end is too abrupt and unfinished....and not in the typical ambiguous way of a horror film. This just ends.",1439596800,2,203,4.666666666666667
7156889,4,B00X3DC73E,This is ok creepy movie  no copy cat movie no held hand camera crap no annoying crying or screams  its just get down to the point I like it  it was not boring,1439510400,3,158,3.727272727272727
8714910,1,B00X3DC73E,"This is a bad attempt to rip off The Conjuring, Annabelle, and movies of the like, and it includes scenes that imitate those fine movies very unconvincingly. Hell, they even rip off Poltergeist and--just to add more sour flavor--make references to the Amityville Horror. There's no real story, the dialogue often doesn't make sense, the film doesn't even attempt to have an ending, and the acting...well, to be fair, it's hard to put in any kind of acting performance with a script this bad. And the music! Horrid, intrusive, annoying. This film kind of makes you wish a poltergeist had invaded your home and smashed the DVD to bits before you could even get it near your player.",1471564800,,679,4.762711864406779

8714912,2,B00X3DC73E,Poltergeist Activity was an ok movie. I'm a huge horror movie fan & it's really hard for me to find any good horror films anymore! This movie was definitely a B rated movie!,1457481600,,173,4.2727272727272725
8714913,2,B00X3DC73E,I am a huge horror movie fan. This was very lackluster with a horribly played out story.,1456876800,,88,4.235294117647059
8714914,1,B00X3DC73E,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO WATCH IT

A dad (Lee Bane) and daughter (Natalie Martins) move into a new home after 1 day of acting school. Mom has recently passed. Daughter is moody, takes pictures and hates the porcelain clown doll. Things happen. Medium and investigator come over. There is some ""Otto"" writing which we knew what it was going to say after ""You"" ""Are"" ...  Sound track too loud and horrible. What was that sound? Was that a humpback whale noise trying to be scary? Could the sad piano player learn a tune or was that asking too much?  Why was Jared Morgan talking like Treebeard?

The ghosts were people in masks. No special effects.

Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Was that supposed to be poltergeist sex?",1448236800,2,735,4.623076923076923

8714917,1,B00X3DC73E,"I couldn't even finish it. The music was too intrusive. I know it was meant as ambience to hieghten to suspense but I honestly just found it distracting. The characters were painful to watch interact with each other. There were a few legitimate scare moments but nothing to rave about. If you're looking for a decent horror movie, I'd say skip this one.",1440720000,2,353,4.619047619047619
