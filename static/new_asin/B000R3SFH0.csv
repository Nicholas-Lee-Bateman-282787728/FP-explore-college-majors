8198727,1,B000R3SFH0,"It's amazing how the basic safety rules are ignored (everyone walking around *and* shooting paintball markers without anyone wearing masks or even goggles!), how everything that you shouldn't do (like running for more than a few seconds in a straight line towards people shooting full auto markers) is depicted as the right approach and how the makers even manage to talk about airsoft, BB and pellet guns!
Oh, and the ""infomercial"" by RAP4 also helped take away any of the remaining credibility or value to this video.

In short: don't buy it and especially don't give it to someone looking to get into paintball! They will get the wrong impression!",1282694400,,650,4.909090909090909
8198728,1,B000R3SFH0,"I was hoping for a good training video for our paintball teams(DOGS OF WAR) young players. However I got a long....long advertisement of several paintball locations. Including shops and fields. And more speedball than scenario. There is two small segment pertaining to scenario or tactical paintball. Very disappointing.
I do not recommend this DVD to anyone seriously looking for a training film.

8198729,1,B000R3SFH0,"The people were nice on the video, but that's it. They review safey well. Lacks tactical information. They only show a small variety of markers. I would not recommend this video to someone who wants to know how to play the paintball well.",1206662400,2,238,4.558139534883721
