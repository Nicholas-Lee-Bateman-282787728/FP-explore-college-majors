615518,4,6303219535,"I watched this movie when i was younger and watched it again, years later, and i still enjoyed it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was so young, but what a good actor. This is also one of my Patricia Arquette fav's too, well right along with Wildflower. It actually made me laugh out loud, which says a lot.",1344556800,3,296,4.4
615519,4,6303219535,"This is overall, a very enjoyable movie. A woman who loose and easy as we used to call it..working at a carnival..so her and her boyfriend ..who was previously an Amish, decide to steal money...they flee to The Amish to hide out...the guy winds up getting killed and the woman has to marry his younger 12 year old brother... Overall..It is delightful...",1329609600,3,353,4.709677419354839
615520,2,6303219535,"okay so i bought this movie! im not a fool .. but i will say i only did cuz one time it was on a free preview back in early 1996 when we were COMPLETELY snowed in. It was the only thing on at the time and i really liked it. i was 12. i bought the dvd when i was like 26. lol oh my how it had changed. its an okay film. just don't expect too much. it reminded me of that tim allen and kirstie alley movie ""for richer or for poorer"" haha",1324252800,,435,3.5416666666666665
615521,5,6303219535,"i love this movie!

615522,4,6303219535,"The film really isn't a bad film- sure it starts off on a bad note, but it does pick up. It is true that the best part about the film is Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- even in his younger days he was still a very believable actor. At first when I heard his accent, I was thinking ""Oh no...,"" but when he's actually on camera for his longer scenes, you suddenly forget that he's as American as anyone, and has no real accent.

Without a doubt, this is a shining moment of young Gordon-Levitt's career (for later standouts, see Forever Lulu, aka Along for the Ride, Sweet Jane, and Manic). Too bad the movie wasn't a little bit better (but it's really not bad).",1129507200,,651,4.336065573770492
615523,5,6303219535,"I don't know why, but I just loved this movie.  Patricia is so charming(as usual).  I'm definitely a fan of her.  I liked how it was tied into the Amish community.  The boy was so perfect.  If he were older he'd be the perfect guy.  The film had action, suspense, a moral, pretty gal, romance, and it was surprisingly engrossing .  I liked the conflicts.  It was fun to see how putting different types of people in different situations would work.",1010880000,12,447,4.432098765432099
615524,4,6303219535,"The plot was somewhat cheesey; but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's presence made it  a worthwhile view.  He does far better in this film than in that lame  comedy ""Third Rock"".",968198400,,167,4.892857142857143
615525,4,6303219535,"It was really funny. Particia Arquette and Joseph Gordan-Levitt are wonderful. It had a great story, good acting, over-all it was cool. Rated PG-13 for: Language, Adult Situations, and brief nudity.",964915200,2,198,5.419354838709677
615526,1,6303219535,Absolutely horrible.  Enough said.  I must have been a murdering lunatic in a previous life to have to endure this visual torture.,949363200,2,130,4.863636363636363

615588,5,6303219535,"I really enjoyed watching Patricia Arquette and Joseph Gordon-Levitt working along side each other in this comical situation of Amish beliefs. Patricia is one of those actresses that can diversify her personality within a projected character, and deliver mesmerizing results. Her role in True Romance was very intriguing, for me, because of her ability to take the volume of a scene from 0 to maximum in as little as a frame rate; giving tremendous quality performances.",1423440000,2,470,5.197368421052632
615589,5,6303219535,Fun older movie with fave Patrcia Arquette she is always a treat. And J. Gordon Legit too.,1423440000,,90,4.352941176470588

615593,2,6303219535,"Alright, I have an issue with the cover. It says ""The Hilariously Sexy Comedy."" Hilarious is a gross overstatement, and I don't know if I could even qualify this as a comedy. It's lighthearted, so I guess I can go with that. But sexy? We have Marilyn Monroe with crooked teeth, and Havana (Patricia Arquette) bending over in the flower bed (admittedly I noticed that). Is a frock and bonnet supposed to be sexy? How about being married to a 12-year old boy? Peter and Havana rob a state fair. The couple hide out at a religious colony in Canada, eh? Peter hides the money, then promptly gets killed in a car accident. Their bible states that the ex-husband's brother (a very young Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to propose to the widow. The kid is smart. He ultimately gets Havana to help him bring back the money. Through a series of ridiculous, only-in-the-movies coincidences, the FBI catch up with them.",1358294400,,902,4.679245283018868
615594,3,6303219535,"I thought this would be much funnier. It wasn't very funny to me. I did enjoy seeing the young male actor, whom has grown up and is in other movies now.",1356825600,,152,3.935483870967742

7842466,4,6303219535,"This film has a lot of sentimental value for me. It was filmed in our home town of Belt, Montana, and at the State Fair in Great Falls (MT). Our ambulance crew was working the state fair, and one scene required us to run over to where a man was having a heart attack, we practiced it about four time, but it ended up on the cutting room floor anyway. The story brings back a lot of memories.",1444348800,2,391,4.0256410256410255
