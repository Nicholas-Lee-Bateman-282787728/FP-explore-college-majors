8439262,5,B004RUE7JO,Wow!  I have played this disc over and over.  The Concierto d'Aranjuez alone is worth the price all by itself.  What a gorgeous piece of music. The  magic of the piece and the haunting refrain provided by the oboe and brass is only interrupted by carollineur's artistry with the bells and the orchestra's emphasis of the theme.  Bravo!.  Yes! It's worth of more than five stars! God! if kids nowadays only knew what they're missing...(sigh),1469750400,2,440,4.8

8439266,5,B004RUE7JO,"This is a concert DVD that ANYONE/EVERYONE who enjoys music and concerts should purchase. Not only are the orchestra selections outstanding, but the exquisite voices of Carmen Monarcha, Suzan Erens, Carla Maffioletti, and The Platin Tenors joined in song are mesmerizing. The power of ""The Second Waltz"" brings 10,000 people in the square to their feet as they begin to sway and dance where there is room. The unbridled joy and chaos of ""The Chanti Song"", that has the orchestra & choir yelling, Andre' jumping around like a march hare, and the lady harpist busting out with dance moves that sends everyone into fits of laughter, will have you laughing out loud. The pyrotechnics, confetti, and fireworks all add to the spectacular, illuminated, churches and scenery around the square. Even a Nightingale contributes to accompany the orchestra during a heart rending instrumental. The added bonus music, and features that show just what it takes to put on an Andre' Rieu concert, will have you astounded and gasping for breath. This 3 hour DVD is worth every cent and will become one you wish to share with others. So pop the corn, curl up with the one you love, and enjoy an evening with the greatest cast of talent to grace the world in our lifetime.",1405555200,7,1252,4.8279069767441865

I'm impressed on how it was put together bring out all the qualities of the performer's.  The lighting was great and added to the great music.  It almost makes one feel like they are right there along side the guests and performers.  I watch it quite often and never get tired of the performance.  Thank you Robert Schumacher,1365379200,3,419,4.4605263157894735

I'm sure the music is great but I am disappointed about disappointng my parents. My father will return it to me, to return to Amazon soon.",1318896000,3,352,4.1911764705882355
