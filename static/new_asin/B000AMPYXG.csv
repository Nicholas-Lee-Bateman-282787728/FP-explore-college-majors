8078906,5,B000AMPYXG,this is a awesome movie. this movie is totally different from the original same concept but in their own image. instead of a man going on a revenge killing spree for his wax sculptures and house getting burned down and himself getting burnt and horribly disfigured and cannot use his hands. in this movie it's about two twins who were conjoined at the face and was surgically removed leaving one disfigured and the other a sociopath. after their parents passed they killed people in town and turned the dead bodies into wax and made the house of wax out of wax. six teenagers stumble upon this town on their way to a football game they get a surprise of their lives. the special effects in this movie were great the house of wax was really made of wax and that made it a lot realistic and cooler. the acting was great and the story was good and original but still gave the concept of the original film. i would have to say there are not too many series like this i like one original mystery of the wax museum(1933) one remake house of wax(1953) and the last remake house of wax(2005) this one that i like them all. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1479081600,,1170,4.322727272727272
