3495732,5,B001BN4WKY,My whole family loves this show. I've even downloaded some of the episodes to my iPhone!!! This show is great for children of all ages! It keeps kids up and moving istead of being in front of the tv like a zombie.,1225584000,,213,4.095238095238095
3495733,5,B001BN4WKY,"Yo Gabba Gabba! is easily one of the best children's show to surface in a very long time. Anyone that has seen the show knows just how infectious the songs are, how cute the characters are and what fun the show is. All the children in my family ranging from two to seven lose their minds when this show comes on. The kids know all the words and they love when it's time to dance.

DJ Lance Rock and his crew of friends always have good lessons to share and the music is incredibly infectious. The online buzz about the show is massive and everyone seems to like it. I've been noticing a slow build up of merchandise in the stores connected with the show and I imagine post-Christmas, Yo Gabba Gabba! will probably be the biggest children's show on the planet without doubt.

Nickelodeon is heavily pushing this show, Wow Wow Wubzy and Little Bill. All these shows are much better than the shows that were available when I was a kid, and they're all award-winning. I let my son watch a two/three hours of TV everyday and I'm thankful that he gets to watch this show, commercial free, either on Noggin or on DVD. Well done.

The episodes on the disk are as follows:

1. Friends
2. Eat
3. Dance
4. Happy

These are some great episodes from the show and I'll definitely look for another volume when it comes out. The extras are a little bit lacking, but the show is what it is and it's enough.

Great show ... well done ...

Go! DJ Lance Rock!",1224892800,2,1439,4.307407407407408
3495734,4,B001BN4WKY,"When I received the dvd I was really disappointed to find out that there are only 4 episodes on it, but I guess you can't expect much for only $12.99. Otherwise I would highly recommend this series. My daughter's only 9 months old and she's already addicted to 'Gabba Gabba', and I don't mind so much because, as wild and crazy as the show is, it's probably one of the most moral things I've seen on tv recently... ""Be nice to everyone"", ""Don't bite your friends"", ""It's more fun to share"", great stuff. I just wish they would release more episodes, and a cd of all the music from the show.",1224028800,18,590,4.324324324324325

3495868,5,B001BN4WKY,"Ordered June 28th, got July 6th. Took a long time to get shipped out. So I wouldn't use Super Saver Shipping if you are in a hurry to get this. (I ordered 3 Yo Gabba Gabba Videos at one time.) They came crammed in a box that was too small and the edge of the dvd cases on top and bottom were crushed. The cases are those new eco kind that are flimsy. But it doesn't matter really to me that isn't why I bought them, I bought them for the show on the dvd (which was fine) and the show is great! My son loves Yo Gabba Gabba and his eyes were glued to the screen and he was bouncing around as soon as it started playing. This is a great show because our son likes it and daddy and I get the songs stuck in our head but they are not as bad as other shows. This is one of the best toddler shows I think ever made and I even find a new episode interesting. Great music, musicians and art. A wide variety of popular and current bands and artist make guest appearances and the artist, Mark is the guy from the band Devo (Whip It!). Great show for the kids and you won't mind it either.",1341532800,,1077,3.9

We got rid of Netflix streaming so got these DVDs so we would still have the show on hand. HOWEVER, each of these DVDs are chock full of commercials for other shows - Ni Hao Kai Lan, Backyardigans, etc. Fine, they are other PBS shows, but I am trying to avoid commercials and that's part of the point of buying the DVDs. It's not a huge deal to put the DVD in and then FF to chapter 6 (when the show actually starts) but it's kind of annoying.

3495879,5,B001BN4WKY,"I don't even know where to start.

This is the best series ever. I love to watch it. My son loves to watch it. We reference the movie to help enforce behaviors such as ""Keep your hands to yourself"" but it's okay to ""high five"".

I laugh about the 80's references that have no connection for my son. Seriously: Elijah Wood dances the ""Puppet Master"" How funny is that? DJ Lance carries a boom box... kids today wouldn't be caught dead carrying a ""mp3"" player that large on their shoulder... but it used to be so COOL!!! it's too funny to handle!

But this show has done even more than entertain! It wasn't until Brobee and his ""Party in my Tummy"" song/dance number and Toodee's ""Try it, you may like it"" song/dance number in the ""EAT"" episode that we really began to see improvements in our ""picky eater"". After watching the episode 2x's we made a ""Party in my Tummy"" dinner, with chicken, cheese, juice, green beans and carrots... all of which except for the juice were ""NEW"" foods. I am happy to say that everything except the Green Beans have been well received and were just the beginning of all the new additions to his diet! Because now, unlike before, he is willing to ""try it""!

HOWEVER, Your children will sit and watch this AT LEAST once a day for a month straight!! Maybe because it's obnoxious and loud and annoying and kids like their parents to endure this obsticle a few times a day! But, whatever it is that makes kids love this movie, it actually does work if your needing a break and got things to do like laundry, dishes, ect. it's really good to have. BUT make sure not to go too far because every 5 seconds, your kids will want you watch parts of it with them.. haha",1309564800,,659,4.28
3495881,5,B001BN4WKY,"I swore up and down that I wouldn't be a parent who let his kid rot his brain watching TV. But now that I actually am a parent instead of an I-know-it-all-even-though-I-don't-have-kids, I'm really glad to have this DVD as a tool in my tool kit. Because God forbid that I actually eat one meal in peace.

Specifically for Yo Gabba Gabba and this DVD in particular, it's great. YGG is one of the very few kids shows that I can watch and actually enjoy. It's quirky and witty, and the songs are pretty catchy. Watching my kid dance along with the show just cracks me up. There's also a very tongue in cheek retro vibe to the show that makes it more appealing to 30 somethings.

Aside from the pop culture coolness, I like the show because it's so different and original. The show riffs on itself and is almost a parody of a kids show. I think that also makes it more appealing to adults. It's not that Sesame Street takes itself too seriously, but when I watch that show I kinda get the impression that the SS crew almost expects kids to believe that there's actually some street in New York where all of this stuff is taking place. I feel like if I told my kid that Elmo wasn't real, it would break his heart. Whereas if I told him that Muno was a guy in a rubber suit, he'd say ""yeah, that makes sense"".

I CANNOT stand Barney or the Wiggles. It's like torture for me to watch or listen to them, but I've seen this DVD about 30 times with my kid and I could probably go for 30 more. If you do any significant amount of driving, I'd also recommend a portable DVD player for the car. I can tell you from experience that it really sucks to circle an airport looking for your in-laws while your kid is fussing in the back seat.

Now, whenever I ask her, ""Do you want to watch Yo Gabba Gabba?"" her whole face lights ups and as soon as she sees DJ Lance Rock, she jumps for joy (literally jumps for joy!).  She loves dancing to all the tunes.  I've t-voed all the episodes off Nick Jr but this DVD is perfect for car rides.  I can play 2 or 3 episodes in a row at home and she doesn't get bored with it.

One day by accident I was clicking through the channels while holding her and Yo gabba gabba was on. She went wild. Her legs and arms stiffened with excitement and she smiled from ear to ear. Then she wiggled and jumped and remained glued to the TV screen until the end of the show. I attempted to interest her in other programs for kids, but they bored her quickly. She is now nearly 6 months old and Yo Gabba Gabba is number one with her. It never fails to excite her as it did the very first time she watched it. Now she laughs out loud. I have been pleased with the quailty of the DVD's and fast shipping.

It features Mark Mothersbaugh, Biz Markie, fat beats from DJ Lance Rock, real kids doing real kid stuff (exploring their worlds through movement, learning social conventions, developing sense of self), and strangely relatable ""Gabbas"" (Muno is tall and friendly, but he also sometimes is clumsy...Brobee is the little green one, but even he forgets the time-honored edict about personal space).  From a curriculum standpoint, the themes for each show are concrete for young children--""fun"", ""eat""--and the even mixture of live action with the Gabbas plus animation and music are reminiscient of old school Sesame Street (when it was really cutting edge and nitty gritty for small children, not the Abby Cadabbified saccharine it has morphed into).  I have a child with an autistic spectrum disorder, and she has internalized a number of social skills that I see the Gabbas displaying--the magic words of please and thank you, remembering to greet a person when seeing them as well as how and when to say goodbye, how to introduce yourself using your own name.  I also like that DJ Lance Rock is an adult African American male who is trustworthy and positive--it is critical that all young children regardless of race see black men (not just our new President although that is a great start!) as someone they can relate to, who can be meaningful in their lives.  The animation in the show is just beautiful--if you can catch the Christmas show in rerun I recommend it--it was especially well done.

3495932,5,B001BN4WKY,"So. Yo Gabba Gabba.

How to describe this show? Start with the title, which is inspired by the The Ramones' timeless Teenage Lobotomy creed, then add DJ Lance Rock, who resembles an anorexic Raj from ""What's Happening!"", and put him in a giant orange wig and striped jumpsuit that makes him look like the complete opposite of a Buckingham Palace guard. DJ Lance Rock then walks onto a white background with a magical boombox (of COURSE there's a magical boombox) towards a long buffet table displaying Gabbaland - or as normal people see it, a minidioramma that seems as if it was made by a 5th grader with a really short attention span. DJ Lance Rock proceeds to open his boombox, revealing a bunch of generic cartoon monsters that get magically transported to Gabbaland, where they transform into generic actors dancing around in monster suits (2 of which proudly display the zipper on the back).

I love this show.

Why? First of all, the music is catchy. Repetitive? Oh yes. Oh yes. But in a good way. You actually don't mind finding yourself unexpectedly humming these little ditties sometime during the day. Then there's the cartoon interludes, which rival anything out of Ren&Stimpy, Spongebob Squarepants, and anything else dreamt up by a stoned college frathouse with basic computer animation skills. Then there's the clips of 5 year old kids either dancing (and reminding you ""I like to dance""), riding random toys, or scanned into Intellivision games from the 1980's.

Then there's the frequent visits from actors and musicians who seem to be ""in on the joke."" In 3 minutes, you can easily bounce from Plex the Magic Robot teaching your kids how to brush their teeth, to Mark Mothersbaugh from 80's alt-punk group Devo instructing you in the finer points of drawing a fish. Skip next to Biz's Beat of the Day, where Biz Markie invites your kid to learn his latest beatbox riff, followed by an animated adventure of Super Martian Robot Girl that would make William Hanna and Joe Barbera cry, then on to Nathan who ""likes to daaaaance!"" (and grooves like he's in a Kanye West video), which leads to the Yo! Gabba Gabba characters singing and dancing about sharing, follwed by Elijah Wood sharing his Puppetmaster dancey dance. DJ Lance Rock then takes us out of every episode by inviting us to look back, and remember what we did today. This consists of quick vignettes of everything covered in that episode, which naturally is mixed into a techno/hip-hop number that includes NYC nightclub electronica/rave special effects in the background.

And somehow, somehow it all comes together. It WORKS. It works for the kids and adults alike. It is at all times a wholesome children's show, an inside joke to gen-Xers who grew up in the 80's, a manifesto for the current Spongebob college crowd, and a useful tool for parents who want something that the kids will enjoy while learning valuable life skills, while making them laugh a little bit inside about how goofy the whole process of parenthood can truly be.",1227052800,139,3016,4.837209302325581
