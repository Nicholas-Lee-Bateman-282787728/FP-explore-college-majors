3065434,5,B0011FLGZQ,"The one thing I am beginning to dislike are how studios tend to forget fans want to collect the whole series...not half of it.  I am so happy that Sliders - Season 4 will be out, and hopefully Season 5 too.  I wish there would be deleted scenes on Season 5 that are put into the very last episode as to not leave it as the cliffhanger as originally aired.  That is wishful thinking on my part.  It is not fun to start a collection, only to wait forever for the next season.  Hopefully, studios will realize this TV-DVD is a lucrative business (hence - Current Writer's Strike negotiations) and decide to start releasing TV shows entire run and at a faster pace.  Hasn't anyone realized walking down the DVD aisles, in stores, that TV shows take up an entire aisle now.",1198368000,19,768,4.373239436619718

3065476,3,B0011FLGZQ,"With the original cast further deteriorating, Kari Whrer as Captain Maggie Beckett steps in to try and fill the void. She takes some getting used to, but it makes sense to have a character with a military background given the premise of many episodes in the season. The Kromaggs, for better or worse, appear frequently. The show definitely reaches in new directions, including any chance to show off Maggie in skimpy clothing. The introduction of Quinn's real-life brother is less painful than it sounds, as he plays a fairly interesting character who rounds out the quartet nicely. The sets are often outstanding and remain one of the strengths of the show.

Among some intense and worthwhile eps that have sociological depth to them (California Reich and My Brother's Keeper come to mind) there are just as many duds and half-a$$ed plots (usually Kromagg eps or those that ignore the former alternate Earth rules). Sliders by this point has unceremoniously dropped the unwritten rules of alternate Earths that were integral to the plotlines of the first two seasons and has instead opted for a ""this is sci-fi, so anything goes"" stance. While this opens up plot possibilities, the charm of the alternate Earths during the first couple seasons (where an alternate history either changes many things just a little bit or a few things drastically) is mostly gone. The alternate Earth premise is now usually denoted by a stay at the Chandler Hotel, but even that constant becomes increasingly bizarre. If you didn't feel that Sliders jumped the shark in Season 3, you will surely notice that it has in Season 4.

By today's standards it is an undeniably campy and [at times] terrible series, but strangely I continued to find it worth watching, and at a good price (on DVD) for 22 episodes.",1373673600,3,1788,4.897689768976898
3065477,2,B0011FLGZQ,"I just came to Amazon.com to say a few words about Season 4 of Sliders and found out that there was still one more bad season of Sliders still in the can that was finally released. I just can't believe there was a season five of this awful show. I don't know why this show wasn't cancelled midway in season three. Sliders just went from a lame show to a very bad to lame show. I own the first four seasons and season three almost killed me, or it seemed to. I have debated many times on selling this show to the pawn shop or to someone at the flea market. I think the reason I keep this show is because it had so much potential. The episodes are even borderline plausible and interesting at times. In season four of sliders they bring in Connelly's brother and some new girl too. So two original actors are gone and two new ones are in. I don't know if the professor guy died in real life during this series or if he merely left. I was always iffy on the value of his character in this show. Anyway, I think I watch this show with disappointment because I see so much possibility that goes down the drain. Every episode involves losing the slider device. Ghosts steal the slider device in one episode, the Cromags get the device in another. In the virtual reality episode those people got the device. The slider remote is the most important device in their slider lives yet they casually leave the damned thing lying around when they know they could be stuck in that world and time for the next 29 years. You'd think that Quinn would keep the remote close to his chest in something like a gun holster or in some specially made pocket in some loose fitting pair of pants. But no, the device is never secured and it's never protected, not even when they all slide into a new world. This slider remote drama is just one part of the stupidity of this series but it can't even begin to match the stupidity of the episodes. I thought I was going to die in the the season four episode when Quinn's double in one world had sent everyone to another world. We find the gang at Quinn's old house and it's FULL, jam packed FULL, of people and two nuns toting shotguns. One nun has a white veil and one has a black veil. Everyone is supposed to have a double here but yet we only seem to see the two nuns, who are obviously twins in real life. The episode started out like the movie The Omega Man. Quinn's brother was the last man on Earth until they all transported to the time where Quinn had sent the people. I cannot describe to you just how awful that entire episode was. Anyway, the entire season four is this bad. Every episode seems to have some promise but still each episode just falls flat on it's face. The acting and the scripts are beyond awful. I watch this crap because it has potential, and because I have the free time and because I like the sense of adventure. I just cannot get over the malaise of this series though. It seems that the Stargate SG1 series seized upon how to slide correctly. Stargaters slide for ten seasons, and with some weak seasons but never with anything approaching the badness of the original Sliders.

Update: I just wanted to add something of a little ""weight"" to my criticism of Sliders the series and season four. I see in Season five that both O'Connell brothers left the show, so we have half the cast again changing. This makes for bad television, movies, etc.

Quinn Mallory***** Jerry O'Connell
Colin Mallory***** Charlie O'Connell
Rembrandt Brown**** Cleavant Derricks
Maggie Beckett***** Kari Wuhrer

As for Season four though I would like to add that I did not find Charlie O' Connell or Kari Wuhrer deficient in the acting department. I thought Kari for instance was quite good in the episode Way Out West. If that was really Kari singing in the episode then I would think she should be proud of her singing ability. And I think Charlie had a good chemistry with his real life brother in the series. This said as I finished this series I could barely stand to watch the final disc of season four.

The final three episodes of season 4 were: The Chasm, Roads Taken and Reveleations.

The Chasm was very weird, stupid and very hard to watch. It was quite confusing. Roads Taken was so stupid to where I literally just fast forwarded through the episode. This was the only time I fast forwarded and episode in the entire four seasons. Finally, Revelations set itself up as a reunion with the real parents of the Quinn and Colin, BUT WAIT, they were almost but not quite his parents and in this CONFUSING episode the Kromags were VICTIMS like the JEWS in German concentration camps. And then there was this jazz about the sliders meeting some science fiction writer on another planet who knew all about the kromags and he had defeated them on his planet or something. Really, the whole episode was pretty confusing and like MANY Slider episodes it just wasn't worth your mental effort to figure out just what the heck was supposed to be happening.

I have to say also that I think the most remarkable fact of this entire show was that Sliders came back for a very half assed season FIVE. It seems that Sliders the tv show,  like some sort of mutant bacteria, could not be killed. So it limped through another season. For Cleavant Derricks and Kari Wuhrer I'm happy enough that they got some work. Cleavant surely deserved the money for this season after having stuck with this retarded show for five seasons. And Kari Wuhrer proved she could act even if she wasn't that much like the actress she replaced.

In closing, I just want to say that like a lot of people I sat through this confusing and stupid show. This show had real science fiction possibilities that were destroyed and mocked one episode at a time. The problem was not so much the acting as the writing. The writing on this show was embarrassingly bad. This show could be redone with some talented writers and it could sail into the areas it should have gone in the first place. I have felt bad giving this show just two stars but the writing just doesn't deserve more than two stars.",1373241600,2,6088,4.4391771019677995
3065478,3,B0011FLGZQ,I Liked the movies but didn't like the new cast. Seems like when they change the cast and themes of movies like this it always ends up worst than the original. Still I like the sliders series.,1372636800,,192,4.216216216216216
3065479,5,B0011FLGZQ,"Sliders was one of the 90's most fun sci fi tv series. It was a fun show and sci fi fans can still find a lot to enjoy watching it. Season three had seen the show doing whatever fantasy idea they had , vampires, and dragons, mixed with some really good sci fi eps.  This season which was on the scy fy channel , and it was one of their first series!;continued the show and returned it to more straight science fiction like it's first two seasons.  It was a shame not to have the professor character and the wade character both either dead or in limbo, but the show did return to the finer moments of season 3 and the first two excellent seasons. The dvd box is as usual a really bad one but the season is fine. And the next season is not all bad either. It's decent and worth watching, some fans hate it. But season 3 had some real escapist shows during it's run too.  So if you enjoy some interesting sci fi , you may find this is cup of tea.",1370217600,,943,4.032085561497326

3065481,3,B0011FLGZQ,"I do like the show....the premise of sliding between worlds is a novel concept as long as you can pull it off. One thing the series fails to do is maximize what they had here.....they had the chance to bring back some more older characters from the other seasons. Remember Quinn's alter female self and how she is now going randomly through wormholes like the cast are? Where did she wind up? and why didn't they make an episode about their next run in? How about....meeting more duplicate sliders that have Wade and Arturo back again? That would have generated more ratings!!!! (unlike the episode where they run into 3 of the 4 characters...Remmie as the scientist..Maggie as a ""dancer"" and Quinn as.......YEAH...not worth mentioning because it was dumb).  I guess these ideas were lost on the writers...and we got stuck with a ""Chasm"" episode and two awful ones from season three....(YOU know which ones).....

The characters had not much time to really develop as they were constantly trying to either find a way off the world, or trying to find each other again. Quinn, who for some strange reason, never let his relationship with Wade really blossom, decided to do the same with Maggie. For a few episodes, they showed some spark, but...at the next episode...IT'S GONE!!!!!

I heard about the fight after the third season concerning the Maggie/Wade characters. If I was the director,I wouldn't have picked one or another...I would have said for them to work it out or both would be cut!!!

But, I guess we will never see the two characters again (even though they helped make the series), no more laughing at Arturo call someone a ""blistering Idiot""....or an episode with Wade actually escaping from the breeding camp. I would have loved to see what her fate was....but NOOOO!!  THANK YOU WRITERS!!!

Now, I hear that the Quinn brothers left...got ""caught"" on a vortex or something and we now have 3 new sliders??  The Quinns helped shape the series and I have heard some bad things about the fifth season. I don't know if its worth getting.....

As with any good series, you need to TIE UP SOME STORY ARCS!!!  They didn't here...what started out with good promise with the first ever episode....ended in disgrace.....maybe one day, someone can utilize the full potential of this series....",1366243200,,2296,4.836734693877551

3065497,4,B0011FLGZQ,"It is always a pleasant surprise to find that all the discs are still securely fastened in their proper place when receiving a multi-disc set of DVD's.  I can't count the number of times I've been sent damaged discs... scuffed and scratched during shipping... having shifted around in the packaging along with the abrasive shards from the broken, plastic anchoring clips. I've seen discs held in place by as many as twelve small, fragile clips.  This problem has existed since CD pakaging first hit the market.

  The first and second seasons of Sliders were lumped together as six discs inserted in a block of polyethylene foam.  It looked super cheesy... but probably offered the best protection [most secure anchoring] for the discs.  But, there was zero literature with the set... no episode guide at all, except for the on-screen guides on the individual discs.  And as we know, the episodes for seasons one and two were not aired by Fox in the correct order... so an episode guide would have helped.

  The third season was shipped in much thinner packaging than seasons 1 & 2 using three quite stout clips to hold each disc in place.  But, they utilized four... double-sided, double stacked discs.  I hate that!  It is nearly impossible to remove a disc without touching one of the sides of either disc.  Fingerprints, anyone?  And of course, you have to remove disc one to get to disc two, and remove disc three to get to disc four. Once again... ZERO literature... just the guides on each disc after loading them in a player.

  I seem to have gotten lucky this time.  For season four... each single-sided disc is individually housed... and although held in place using those infamous plastic clips... five thick clips per disc... all were intact.  And get this... THERE IS AN EPISODE GUIDE !!

  So, all four seasons of Sliders have arrived to me in an un-scratched condition... unlike many other multi-disc sets purchased through Amazon.  And it would seem that they have finally realized that an episode guide was worth including in the packaging.  Bravo, Universal... Bravo!",1332115200,,2087,4.841359773371105
3065498,2,B0011FLGZQ,"This once-great show went down the tubes creatively in Season 3. Fans complained, and the producers listened . . . sort of. There are a few more gems this season, but Quinn's backstory is ludicrously re-written; the once fearsome Kromaggs are turned into generic Saturday morning villains; and the wonderful Sabrina Lloyd is gone, replaced with Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie, who plays Quinn's brother in the most wooden fashion possible.

Even the best episodes of this season are virtually unrecognizable as the same series that premiered in 1995.

 like the show very much and the fourth season was good, but Not as good as the previous ones.
they added new villens like the kromeggs(which were shown on season 2 for one episodes), they where good until the point that half of the season revolves around them and the fact that they wore natzi uniformes was too much.
the new locations where very similar to one anoter regarding the back storeis , high tech worlds, vr worlds, kromegg words,in contrast to the previous seasons that the wordls were more intresting.

3065506,5,B0011FLGZQ,"I used to love watching sliders years ago but for some reason stopped watching it after the 2nd season. Possibly because I didn't have cable at the time it moved to sci fi. Once in a while I would catch reruns when I could years later but I never knew what actually happened since I stopped. Then the show stopped showing reruns and I was missing Sliders again. Until I saw that season 1 & 2 was for $20 (which I got) and the other seasons as cheap

If you have never heard of the show. Its about a college student named Quinn Mallory (Jerry O'Connel) his friend who is a girl named Wade Wells (Sabrina Loyd), former 60s-70s singer Rambrant brown (forgor his name) and Prof. Autaro (forgot his name but played Glimii in Lord of the Rings) discover there are altnerate universes where its the same place, time (with one exception) with the same people (sometimes not) but a different road was taken. (Russia won the cold war, england won the American Revolution, etc). They travel to these worlds but cant find their way home, now they must travel to each world until they find theirs without getting killed or trapped in the world.

Season 4's dvd case is like a book with each dvd on a page. As for special features, season 4 has an amazing grand total of.....Drum role please..............0 special features.

Now the reason why I gave this dvd set a perfect score is because regardless or the lack of special features, this show is great. Each episode is exciting (though some aren't as good as others) and intriguing with the what might have been theory.

If you loved the show, if you love sci fi, or tv in general get this before they stop doing the dual pack (after you get seasons 1 & 2, & 3), if you miss out still get it",1268956800,,1730,4.396875

3065509,4,B0011FLGZQ,"When i was a teenager i LOVED watching Sliders every week and was always upset when rumors would come around about its possible cancelation. This season was the season that it switched from Fox to SciFi and while it isn't the BEST of the seasons it is still a great and entertaining show. I personally enjoy the Kromag plot. The former ongoing plot of just trying to get home was starting to get old. The Kromag's added action and excitement that was starting to leave the show. They were able to still do the normal  ""New world new view"" plots but still have a sense of URGENCY in the show.
My only major problems with the show are 1.) The price, $45? really? The first two sets were around $20 and then you pop it up to $45? (and thats Amazon price i've seen it other places for the full price of almost $70) 2.) the lack of extras in the set. Now being that it is a show that came around LONG before DVDs or things of the sort, i don't expect a plethora of extras and behind the scenes options. But one or two interviews or making of things would be nice and not asking much... especially with the EXTREMELY high price that is being asked.

I had the luck of being online during the holiday season when they had a limited time one day price drop of 12.50 for the set. Otherwise i would more than likely NEVER have purchased it for the price asked.
If you LOVE the show like i do and did and either find it for cheap or have some extra money than i say buy it. The Season itself is actually very good and fun.

My one big advice..... avoid Season5 when ever it comes out at ALLLLLLL effort. The last true tying force of Quinn is GONE and the writing and characters just are gone in that season.",1260230400,5,1696,4.180428134556575

3065515,5,B0011FLGZQ,So far this is the best season of sliders and I am ready for the release of Season 5.  There is more action and actually more drama in this season so far.,1227398400,,154,3.8125
3065516,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Let's just start out by saying that Sliders is far from perfect.  I loved it dearly from episode 1, but I have been a die-hard Jerry O'Connell fan ever since Stand By Me was released.

HOWEVER - if you are not a huge Jerry O'Connell fan, you may want to think before you indulge.

If you love science fiction for it's storytelling value - and not necessarily it's accuracy in depicting current scientific theory (and even facts, on occasion) - then you may still like this show.

If you're a science purist, avert your eyes.  You won't be happy.

Jerry O'Connell is very entertaining in most of his works, and Sliders was just the vehicle to get him more attention than he had before.  The geek prodigy Quinn Mallory has just enough cool in him to be fun and include some action along the way.

In the fourth season Quinn and his friends are joined by his brother, Collin.  Collin is also very smart and fun, but less cool - and he grew up in a paralell dimension that didn't have as much knowledge as our real world now has.  He is more of a dramatic and humorous element, taking us a little off the track of the science part of the fiction.  Collin is also portrayed by Jerry O'Connell's real-life brother, Charlie.  The two of them are great together and the show hits a whole new level of entertaining when they are both on.

I think Kari Wuhrer is terrific as Maggie, but feel sorry for her sometimes because the writers can't seem to make up their minds about what kind of person her character is.

Of course, Cleavant Derricks is excellent at whatever he is asked to portray.  He is always Rembrandt Brown through and through.  The Cryin' Man is the kind of person who basically does what needs to be done when  it is needed.  Singer, lover, fighter, mechanic, scream in fear... you name it!

Those of us who watched the show from the beginning miss the professor and Wade when they are gone, but the new ensemble works well and most of the stories are certainly unique.

3065518,2,B0011FLGZQ,"Season 4 was the year when half of the original ensemble had been deleted... and it was also the yeat when the Sliders began the Kromagg arc (which lasted almost the entire season if my memory is correct.)

It's difficult to discern which of these elements did the most damage to Sliders: lower production budgets; weak scripts; loss of two strong cast members. Since I have not ever watched ""Babylon 5"" my knowledge of their season long story arcs is nil, but ST Enterprise had a great one with the season 4 ""Xindi"" arc. Unfortunately, while the concept of the Kromaggs was solid, the endingly similar sets and plots killed any potential that might have existed. Budgets could have limited the sets and constrained the scripts.

About half the acting talent was gone - or rendered mute - in this season. Jerry O'Connell was and is a powerful acting talent... probably near the same level as the younger Val Kilmer (before he became too much of a 'star' to get the better roles.)

It became a struggle to watch this season and when JOC left, impossible.

3065520,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Um... while this season had major changes in cast, it did do something most shows won't: remove lead characters by death or other means. In real life, people die, leave, reject others and so forth. Apart from the fact that the actors wearied of the show or protested and left, the idea within the world of the characters is that people die, people get captured, people leave (for whatever reason). It is one of the things I liked about Babylon 5, that lead characters died or left as would happen in reality.

The stories were up and down. Some very good, some not so much, but the ""standard"" of story telling was pretty consistent. The Kromagg sub-plot kept things moving forward in the story arc, as well as the desire to find their real ""home"". That I like. I wish more shows would develop a full story arc and then populate the episodes to move through the arc, again, like B5. All stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Regardless of the ""hit"" status of a show, better to stop it on top, when the story is done than keep it going (Stargate ended...but then didn't).

I guess I liked the season overall. Having not seen it since airing on Sci-Fi low those many years back, it was fresh again. I never actually saw any of Season 5, in which I am given to understand even more changes occurred.

3065526,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Of course I don't know anything about hollywood diplomatics, but I did extensive research on this series and found that seems to be the pervaying belief.
This series began with the concept of travel between alternate realities, sideways timetravel as it was described to studios. A concept that was inevitably destined to be made into a television show but as demonstrated by the rapid decline of quality in this show it can be made well or pathetically.
I loved the first two season. The chemistry between all the characters was incredible. The stories were all centered around the what ifs of history. If we hadn't won the revolutionary war, if technology had been banded, if the 60s movement hadn't died out. Every episode was interesting and surprising. As a writer myself, a fact I try to selfishly shove into everything I say, I was shocked by how good the stories were and how the rather elaborate concept could be understood quickly in every episode.
Then season three came around. At the time the studios were afraid that the older cast members and more thinky television stories would scare away the viewers. A fact that makes me question if these studio people had forgotten that, when the series was cancelled half way through the first season, already avid fans wrote tons of letters to get the series renewed. So they replaced the Professor with Maggie. Now unlike alot of reviewers here I think Kari Wuhrer did a fairly good job becoming an interesting and integral part of the team considering that the whole point of her character was to show off her incredible figure as much as possible. And the episodes became more action packed and parodies of major motion pictures. I still liked several episodes, enough to keep my interest in the show.
This season was a slight return to the shows origins, alternate realities, although the action level remained high. They lost Wade, a fact that I am still fuming about, and the Quin's secret origins and his brother were story points that I could have lived without.
In conclusion I will recomend purchasing this to anyone who was a fan of this show. It was a fantastic concept that, if it had been left alone, might still be running today. Count this as another on a long list of television shows that were not given a fair shake by their studio.",1206403200,10,2307,4.727047146401985

Some of the very finest episodes of the series are in this season, presenting some novel sci-fi concepts and furthering the show's mythology.

There's an episode where an alternate Quinn accidentally slides his entire world away, an episode where all citizens are forcefully medicated by the government, an episode where the sliders are turned into computer data, and episodes dealing with themes as diverse as racial cleansing, reality television, an anti-Kromagg virus, the technological divide, cloning for body parts and rapid aging.

3065530,3,B0011FLGZQ,"The short first season of Sliders (10 episodes) was quite good! Just the right amount of humor mixed with interesting stories. But, beginning with season two, the series started to SLIDE in the wrong direction. Character development was placed secondary to repetitive plots. This trend continued in season three, four, and five.

Script problems aside, Sliders always remained an entertaining series, mainly because of the natural chemistry between the actors. In the end, a poor decision to make drastic changes to the cast finally destroyed all remaining integrity.

HUGE COMPLAINT:

$59.99 list price? What moron came up with that figure? Many more of these might sell at a $24.99 price point.

UPDATE; For a short time, Amazon dropped the pre-order price to $29.99, which was quite fair. The fact that Amazon slashed the price by HALF during the pre-order phase, tells me that sales were at a stand-still and they needed a quick jump start. At $59.99 it isn't surprising that nobody was buying!

* Only buy this one when it's on sale!

Packaged better than season three! Five single sided discs in a flip style case (Like Star Trek Deep Space Nine).

[Spoiler Warning]
The following paragraph reveals changes to the cast.

The series was never the same after losing John Rhys-Davies (Professor Arturo) and Sabrina Lloyd (Wade Welles). However, season four does represent a huge improvement in the plot/script department when compared to most of season three. After all, I don't think you can get much worse than ""The Fire Within"" or ""Slither"" (Season three).

3065533,5,B0011FLGZQ,"It took a big swift kick in the tush to get Universal Studios to FINALLY release season four of Sliders and now we fans own the DVD before they are all in their 70s and in rocking chairs! It was probably the studio's latest battle with the bootleg industry that finally got them listening.

Although this season lacked the humor of the other three seasons (I deeply miss John Rye Davies) this season has the most action of any other. Unlike any other season the Kromags were given a role as a group of villains identical to the Nazis. Many episodes were actually downright scary.

The very best episode of all is ""California Reich"", in which the sliders land on a world that still discriminates by race and surgically converts blacks into faceless beings called ""eddies"". The last part of this episode is really a shocker.

One very major change is the character of Cleavant Derricks. In the first three seasons the character ""Rembrandt"" was a bit similar to that of Stan Laurel with John Rye Davies' character, which was a bit like Oliver Hardy. In season four, ""Rembrandt"" is a completely new character, that of a very angry militant who vows revenge. It's hard to believe he is the same Rembrandt.

The lead actor, Jerry O'Connell, had his best season to date. Not only does he do well as Quinn, but he does extremely well as some very colorful atler egos. In the episode ""The Alternateville Horror"" he shows he has skill as a comedian when he plays a counterpart who is a spaced out hippie.

The only drawback to this season is another actor, Charlie O'Connell who, unlike his older brother, does not seem to have much acting ability. Evidently he did not have much acting experience. He started out as a fashion model. Charlie O'Connell was hardly a replacement for John Rye Davies or Sabrina Lloyd and seems to be there only to take up space, or rather, to fill a quota of four lead actors.

Although Kari Wuhrer was also originally there for a purpose other than acting (obviously to attract horny young men to the show) she truly  shows she has a LOT of acting ability anyway, despite what the producers originally intended her to do. She does a wonderful job and moved me with many scenes.

All in all, this is a great season to watch.

3065534,3,B0011FLGZQ,"First the technical stuff:

In a very good move, the disks in this set are single-sided!  An improvement over season 3.  The box (exterior and interior) design is similar to season 3 with different art/colors. It's a 5 tray digipak design with a tape hinge that's glued to a flexible green translucent plastic ""wrap around"" cover. The portion of the cover hidden by the slipcase has episode information screened on it, which is nice and a first for this series. Video is Full Frame (1.33:1) as originally broadcast, and looks very good.  Audio is English Dolby Digital 2.0. There are English subtitles. Disks 1, 4, & 5 have 4 episodes each with disks 2 & 3 having 5 each.  From all appearances, ""missing scenes"" have been restored to the appropriate episodes.

Comments about the season:

Sliders moved from Fox to the Sci Fi Channel beginning with this season. The first episode garnered the highest premiere rating that the Sci Fi Channel had ever received up until that point.

We left our intrepid team (minus Prof. Arturo, plus Maggie [Kari Wuhrer]) at the end of season 3 with a damaged timer that doesn't track Rickman's wormhole.  This separates Wade and Rembrandt from Quinn and Maggie on different worlds.

We open season 4 as Quinn finally repairs the timer so it can track Wade and Rembrandt's photon trail to Earth Prime.  He and Maggie return to Earth Prime only to find it in the hands of the Kromaggs. Wade is kidnapped (off screen), Rembrandt is rescued, Quinn learns that Wade has been shipped ""off-world"" (actually an alternate Earth).

Sabrina Lloyd had left the show between seasons after friction on the set between her and Wuhrer led her to demand that Executive Producer David Peckinpah pick between the two of them. Peckinpah chose Wuhrer - and Wade was left to occasional mentions as a breeding host for Humaggs.  This was the plot device to explain her absense.

In the sixth episode of the season Charlie O'Connell (brother of Jerry) joined the regular cast (at Jerry's insistence) as Quinn's brother Colin for his only season. Can you say nepotism?

Season 4 is dominated by the Kromags as the focus changed from attempting to get home to one of freeing Earth Prime from Kromag control. It would be Jerry O'Connell's final year on the show. While the overall direction of season 4 *was* an improvement over that of season 3 I found myself growing indifferent as it progressed. What had started out as an innovative approach on a time travel motif appeared to be turning into just another Sci Fi Channel cheesefest.  I stopped watching about half-way into the season.

Now, having finally purchased and rewatched the entire season I stand by my comments. It *is* a bit better than the last half of season 3 but is not the best the show has to offer.  I *still* miss Arturo.  The episodes feel a bit ""less"" without his presence, and Wuhrer seems not much more than ""eye candy""... Dialog is frequently cheesy and trite with lots of ""recycled"" type plotlines.

I recommend season 4 only if you are a fan or if it can be purchased for less than a sawbuck (I got mine for half that).

So, the final tally is:
Set design/quality = 4
Sliders Season 4 = 2
Average = 3

10/21/11 - Season 5 has been announced with a January 17th, 2012 release date.  Early views of the package shows it to be identical to the season 4 but in blue this time and with single-sided disks.

I am so happy that Sliders - Season 4 will be out, and hopefully Season 5 too.  I wish there would be deleted scenes on Season 5 that are put into the very last episode as to not leave it as the cliffhanger as originally aired.  That is wishful thinking on my part.  It is not fun to start a collection, only to wait forever for the next season.  Hopefully, studios will realize this TV-DVD is a lucrative business (hence - Current Writer's Strike negotiations) and decide to start releasing TV shows entire run and at a faster pace.

3299973,3,B0011FLGZQ,"With the original cast further deteriorating, Kari Whrer as Captain Maggie Beckett steps in to try and fill the void. She takes some getting used to, but it makes sense to have a character with a military background given the premise of many episodes in the season. The Kromaggs, for better or worse, appear frequently. The show definitely reaches in new directions, including any chance to show off Maggie in skimpy clothing. The introduction of Quinn's real-life brother is less painful than it sounds, as he plays a fairly interesting character who rounds out the quartet nicely. The sets are often outstanding and remain one of the strengths of the show.

Among some intense and worthwhile eps that have sociological depth to them (California Reich and My Brother's Keeper come to mind) there are just as many duds and half-a$$ed plots (usually Kromagg eps or those that ignore the former alternate Earth rules). Sliders by this point has unceremoniously dropped the unwritten rules of alternate Earths that were integral to the plotlines of the first two seasons and has instead opted for a ""this is sci-fi, so anything goes"" stance. While this opens up plot possibilities, the charm of the alternate Earths during the first couple seasons (where an alternate history either changes many things just a little bit or a few things drastically) is mostly gone. The alternate Earth premise is now usually denoted by a stay at the Chandler Hotel, but even that constant becomes increasingly bizarre. If you didn't feel that Sliders jumped the shark in Season 3, you will surely notice that it has in Season 4.

By today's standards it is an undeniably campy and [at times] terrible series, but strangely I continued to find it worth watching, and at a good price (on DVD) for 22 episodes.",1373673600,3,1788,4.897689768976898
3299974,2,B0011FLGZQ,"I just came to Amazon.com to say a few words about Season 4 of Sliders and found out that there was still one more bad season of Sliders still in the can that was finally released. I just can't believe there was a season five of this awful show. I don't know why this show wasn't cancelled midway in season three. Sliders just went from a lame show to a very bad to lame show. I own the first four seasons and season three almost killed me, or it seemed to. I have debated many times on selling this show to the pawn shop or to someone at the flea market. I think the reason I keep this show is because it had so much potential. The episodes are even borderline plausible and interesting at times. In season four of sliders they bring in Connelly's brother and some new girl too. So two original actors are gone and two new ones are in. I don't know if the professor guy died in real life during this series or if he merely left. I was always iffy on the value of his character in this show. Anyway, I think I watch this show with disappointment because I see so much possibility that goes down the drain. Every episode involves losing the slider device. Ghosts steal the slider device in one episode, the Cromags get the device in another. In the virtual reality episode those people got the device. The slider remote is the most important device in their slider lives yet they casually leave the damned thing lying around when they know they could be stuck in that world and time for the next 29 years. You'd think that Quinn would keep the remote close to his chest in something like a gun holster or in some specially made pocket in some loose fitting pair of pants. But no, the device is never secured and it's never protected, not even when they all slide into a new world. This slider remote drama is just one part of the stupidity of this series but it can't even begin to match the stupidity of the episodes. I thought I was going to die in the the season four episode when Quinn's double in one world had sent everyone to another world. We find the gang at Quinn's old house and it's FULL, jam packed FULL, of people and two nuns toting shotguns. One nun has a white veil and one has a black veil. Everyone is supposed to have a double here but yet we only seem to see the two nuns, who are obviously twins in real life. The episode started out like the movie The Omega Man. Quinn's brother was the last man on Earth until they all transported to the time where Quinn had sent the people. I cannot describe to you just how awful that entire episode was. Anyway, the entire season four is this bad. Every episode seems to have some promise but still each episode just falls flat on it's face. The acting and the scripts are beyond awful. I watch this crap because it has potential, and because I have the free time and because I like the sense of adventure. I just cannot get over the malaise of this series though. It seems that the Stargate SG1 series seized upon how to slide correctly. Stargaters slide for ten seasons, and with some weak seasons but never with anything approaching the badness of the original Sliders.

Update: I just wanted to add something of a little ""weight"" to my criticism of Sliders the series and season four. I see in Season five that both O'Connell brothers left the show, so we have half the cast again changing. This makes for bad television, movies, etc.

Quinn Mallory***** Jerry O'Connell
Colin Mallory***** Charlie O'Connell
Rembrandt Brown**** Cleavant Derricks
Maggie Beckett***** Kari Wuhrer

As for Season four though I would like to add that I did not find Charlie O' Connell or Kari Wuhrer deficient in the acting department. I thought Kari for instance was quite good in the episode Way Out West. If that was really Kari singing in the episode then I would think she should be proud of her singing ability. And I think Charlie had a good chemistry with his real life brother in the series. This said as I finished this series I could barely stand to watch the final disc of season four.

The final three episodes of season 4 were: The Chasm, Roads Taken and Reveleations.

The Chasm was very weird, stupid and very hard to watch. It was quite confusing. Roads Taken was so stupid to where I literally just fast forwarded through the episode. This was the only time I fast forwarded and episode in the entire four seasons. Finally, Revelations set itself up as a reunion with the real parents of the Quinn and Colin, BUT WAIT, they were almost but not quite his parents and in this CONFUSING episode the Kromags were VICTIMS like the JEWS in German concentration camps. And then there was this jazz about the sliders meeting some science fiction writer on another planet who knew all about the kromags and he had defeated them on his planet or something. Really, the whole episode was pretty confusing and like MANY Slider episodes it just wasn't worth your mental effort to figure out just what the heck was supposed to be happening.

I have to say also that I think the most remarkable fact of this entire show was that Sliders came back for a very half assed season FIVE. It seems that Sliders the tv show,  like some sort of mutant bacteria, could not be killed. So it limped through another season. For Cleavant Derricks and Kari Wuhrer I'm happy enough that they got some work. Cleavant surely deserved the money for this season after having stuck with this retarded show for five seasons. And Kari Wuhrer proved she could act even if she wasn't that much like the actress she replaced.

In closing, I just want to say that like a lot of people I sat through this confusing and stupid show. This show had real science fiction possibilities that were destroyed and mocked one episode at a time. The problem was not so much the acting as the writing. The writing on this show was embarrassingly bad. This show could be redone with some talented writers and it could sail into the areas it should have gone in the first place. I have felt bad giving this show just two stars but the writing just doesn't deserve more than two stars.",1373241600,2,6088,4.4391771019677995
3299975,3,B0011FLGZQ,I Liked the movies but didn't like the new cast. Seems like when they change the cast and themes of movies like this it always ends up worst than the original. Still I like the sliders series.,1372636800,,192,4.216216216216216
3299976,5,B0011FLGZQ,"Sliders was one of the 90's most fun sci fi tv series. It was a fun show and sci fi fans can still find a lot to enjoy watching it. Season three had seen the show doing whatever fantasy idea they had , vampires, and dragons, mixed with some really good sci fi eps.  This season which was on the scy fy channel , and it was one of their first series!;continued the show and returned it to more straight science fiction like it's first two seasons.  It was a shame not to have the professor character and the wade character both either dead or in limbo, but the show did return to the finer moments of season 3 and the first two excellent seasons. The dvd box is as usual a really bad one but the season is fine. And the next season is not all bad either. It's decent and worth watching, some fans hate it. But season 3 had some real escapist shows during it's run too.  So if you enjoy some interesting sci fi , you may find this is cup of tea.",1370217600,,943,4.032085561497326

3299978,3,B0011FLGZQ,"I do like the show....the premise of sliding between worlds is a novel concept as long as you can pull it off. One thing the series fails to do is maximize what they had here.....they had the chance to bring back some more older characters from the other seasons. Remember Quinn's alter female self and how she is now going randomly through wormholes like the cast are? Where did she wind up? and why didn't they make an episode about their next run in? How about....meeting more duplicate sliders that have Wade and Arturo back again? That would have generated more ratings!!!! (unlike the episode where they run into 3 of the 4 characters...Remmie as the scientist..Maggie as a ""dancer"" and Quinn as.......YEAH...not worth mentioning because it was dumb).  I guess these ideas were lost on the writers...and we got stuck with a ""Chasm"" episode and two awful ones from season three....(YOU know which ones).....

The characters had not much time to really develop as they were constantly trying to either find a way off the world, or trying to find each other again. Quinn, who for some strange reason, never let his relationship with Wade really blossom, decided to do the same with Maggie. For a few episodes, they showed some spark, but...at the next episode...IT'S GONE!!!!!

I heard about the fight after the third season concerning the Maggie/Wade characters. If I was the director,I wouldn't have picked one or another...I would have said for them to work it out or both would be cut!!!

But, I guess we will never see the two characters again (even though they helped make the series), no more laughing at Arturo call someone a ""blistering Idiot""....or an episode with Wade actually escaping from the breeding camp. I would have loved to see what her fate was....but NOOOO!!  THANK YOU WRITERS!!!

Now, I hear that the Quinn brothers left...got ""caught"" on a vortex or something and we now have 3 new sliders??  The Quinns helped shape the series and I have heard some bad things about the fifth season. I don't know if its worth getting.....

As with any good series, you need to TIE UP SOME STORY ARCS!!!  They didn't here...what started out with good promise with the first ever episode....ended in disgrace.....maybe one day, someone can utilize the full potential of this series....",1366243200,,2296,4.836734693877551

3299994,4,B0011FLGZQ,"It is always a pleasant surprise to find that all the discs are still securely fastened in their proper place when receiving a multi-disc set of DVD's.  I can't count the number of times I've been sent damaged discs... scuffed and scratched during shipping... having shifted around in the packaging along with the abrasive shards from the broken, plastic anchoring clips. I've seen discs held in place by as many as twelve small, fragile clips.  This problem has existed since CD pakaging first hit the market.

  The first and second seasons of Sliders were lumped together as six discs inserted in a block of polyethylene foam.  It looked super cheesy... but probably offered the best protection [most secure anchoring] for the discs.  But, there was zero literature with the set... no episode guide at all, except for the on-screen guides on the individual discs.  And as we know, the episodes for seasons one and two were not aired by Fox in the correct order... so an episode guide would have helped.

  The third season was shipped in much thinner packaging than seasons 1 & 2 using three quite stout clips to hold each disc in place.  But, they utilized four... double-sided, double stacked discs.  I hate that!  It is nearly impossible to remove a disc without touching one of the sides of either disc.  Fingerprints, anyone?  And of course, you have to remove disc one to get to disc two, and remove disc three to get to disc four. Once again... ZERO literature... just the guides on each disc after loading them in a player.

  I seem to have gotten lucky this time.  For season four... each single-sided disc is individually housed... and although held in place using those infamous plastic clips... five thick clips per disc... all were intact.  And get this... THERE IS AN EPISODE GUIDE !!

  So, all four seasons of Sliders have arrived to me in an un-scratched condition... unlike many other multi-disc sets purchased through Amazon.  And it would seem that they have finally realized that an episode guide was worth including in the packaging.  Bravo, Universal... Bravo!",1332115200,,2087,4.841359773371105

There are a few more gems this season, but Quinn's backstory is ludicrously re-written; the once fearsome Kromaggs are turned into generic Saturday morning villains; and the wonderful Sabrina Lloyd is gone, replaced with Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie, who plays Quinn's brother in the most wooden fashion possible.

Even the best episodes of this season are virtually unrecognizable as the same series that premiered in 1995.

3300003,5,B0011FLGZQ,"I used to love watching sliders years ago but for some reason stopped watching it after the 2nd season. Possibly because I didn't have cable at the time it moved to sci fi. Once in a while I would catch reruns when I could years later but I never knew what actually happened since I stopped. Then the show stopped showing reruns and I was missing Sliders again. Until I saw that season 1 & 2 was for $20 (which I got) and the other seasons as cheap

If you have never heard of the show. Its about a college student named Quinn Mallory (Jerry O'Connel) his friend who is a girl named Wade Wells (Sabrina Loyd), former 60s-70s singer Rambrant brown (forgor his name) and Prof. Autaro (forgot his name but played Glimii in Lord of the Rings) discover there are altnerate universes where its the same place, time (with one exception) with the same people (sometimes not) but a different road was taken. (Russia won the cold war, england won the American Revolution, etc). They travel to these worlds but cant find their way home, now they must travel to each world until they find theirs without getting killed or trapped in the world.

Season 4's dvd case is like a book with each dvd on a page. As for special features, season 4 has an amazing grand total of.....Drum role please..............0 special features.

Now the reason why I gave this dvd set a perfect score is because regardless or the lack of special features, this show is great. Each episode is exciting (though some aren't as good as others) and intriguing with the what might have been theory.

3300006,4,B0011FLGZQ,"When i was a teenager i LOVED watching Sliders every week and was always upset when rumors would come around about its possible cancelation. This season was the season that it switched from Fox to SciFi and while it isn't the BEST of the seasons it is still a great and entertaining show. I personally enjoy the Kromag plot. The former ongoing plot of just trying to get home was starting to get old. The Kromag's added action and excitement that was starting to leave the show. They were able to still do the normal  ""New world new view"" plots but still have a sense of URGENCY in the show.
My only major problems with the show are 1.) The price, $45? really? The first two sets were around $20 and then you pop it up to $45? (and thats Amazon price i've seen it other places for the full price of almost $70) 2.) the lack of extras in the set. Now being that it is a show that came around LONG before DVDs or things of the sort, i don't expect a plethora of extras and behind the scenes options. But one or two interviews or making of things would be nice and not asking much... especially with the EXTREMELY high price that is being asked.

I had the luck of being online during the holiday season when they had a limited time one day price drop of 12.50 for the set. Otherwise i would more than likely NEVER have purchased it for the price asked.
If you LOVE the show like i do and did and either find it for cheap or have some extra money than i say buy it. The Season itself is actually very good and fun.

My one big advice..... avoid Season5 when ever it comes out at ALLLLLLL effort. The last true tying force of Quinn is GONE and the writing and characters just are gone in that season.",1260230400,5,1696,4.180428134556575

3300013,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Let's just start out by saying that Sliders is far from perfect.  I loved it dearly from episode 1, but I have been a die-hard Jerry O'Connell fan ever since Stand By Me was released.

HOWEVER - if you are not a huge Jerry O'Connell fan, you may want to think before you indulge.

If you love science fiction for it's storytelling value - and not necessarily it's accuracy in depicting current scientific theory (and even facts, on occasion) - then you may still like this show.

If you're a science purist, avert your eyes.  You won't be happy.

Jerry O'Connell is very entertaining in most of his works, and Sliders was just the vehicle to get him more attention than he had before.  The geek prodigy Quinn Mallory has just enough cool in him to be fun and include some action along the way.

In the fourth season Quinn and his friends are joined by his brother, Collin.  Collin is also very smart and fun, but less cool - and he grew up in a paralell dimension that didn't have as much knowledge as our real world now has.  He is more of a dramatic and humorous element, taking us a little off the track of the science part of the fiction.  Collin is also portrayed by Jerry O'Connell's real-life brother, Charlie.  The two of them are great together and the show hits a whole new level of entertaining when they are both on.

I think Kari Wuhrer is terrific as Maggie, but feel sorry for her sometimes because the writers can't seem to make up their minds about what kind of person her character is.

Of course, Cleavant Derricks is excellent at whatever he is asked to portray.  He is always Rembrandt Brown through and through.  The Cryin' Man is the kind of person who basically does what needs to be done when  it is needed.  Singer, lover, fighter, mechanic, scream in fear... you name it!

Those of us who watched the show from the beginning miss the professor and Wade when they are gone, but the new ensemble works well and most of the stories are certainly unique.

3300015,2,B0011FLGZQ,"Season 4 was the year when half of the original ensemble had been deleted... and it was also the yeat when the Sliders began the Kromagg arc (which lasted almost the entire season if my memory is correct.)

It's difficult to discern which of these elements did the most damage to Sliders: lower production budgets; weak scripts; loss of two strong cast members. Since I have not ever watched ""Babylon 5"" my knowledge of their season long story arcs is nil, but ST Enterprise had a great one with the season 4 ""Xindi"" arc. Unfortunately, while the concept of the Kromaggs was solid, the endingly similar sets and plots killed any potential that might have existed. Budgets could have limited the sets and constrained the scripts.

About half the acting talent was gone - or rendered mute - in this season. Jerry O'Connell was and is a powerful acting talent... probably near the same level as the younger Val Kilmer (before he became too much of a 'star' to get the better roles.)

It became a struggle to watch this season and when JOC left, impossible.

3300017,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Um... while this season had major changes in cast, it did do something most shows won't: remove lead characters by death or other means. In real life, people die, leave, reject others and so forth. Apart from the fact that the actors wearied of the show or protested and left, the idea within the world of the characters is that people die, people get captured, people leave (for whatever reason). It is one of the things I liked about Babylon 5, that lead characters died or left as would happen in reality.

The stories were up and down. Some very good, some not so much, but the ""standard"" of story telling was pretty consistent. The Kromagg sub-plot kept things moving forward in the story arc, as well as the desire to find their real ""home"". That I like. I wish more shows would develop a full story arc and then populate the episodes to move through the arc, again, like B5. All stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Regardless of the ""hit"" status of a show, better to stop it on top, when the story is done than keep it going (Stargate ended...but then didn't).

I guess I liked the season overall. Having not seen it since airing on Sci-Fi low those many years back, it was fresh again. I never actually saw any of Season 5, in which I am given to understand even more changes occurred.

3300023,4,B0011FLGZQ,"Of course I don't know anything about hollywood diplomatics, but I did extensive research on this series and found that seems to be the pervaying belief.
This series began with the concept of travel between alternate realities, sideways timetravel as it was described to studios. A concept that was inevitably destined to be made into a television show but as demonstrated by the rapid decline of quality in this show it can be made well or pathetically.
I loved the first two season. The chemistry between all the characters was incredible. The stories were all centered around the what ifs of history. If we hadn't won the revolutionary war, if technology had been banded, if the 60s movement hadn't died out. Every episode was interesting and surprising. As a writer myself, a fact I try to selfishly shove into everything I say, I was shocked by how good the stories were and how the rather elaborate concept could be understood quickly in every episode.
Then season three came around. At the time the studios were afraid that the older cast members and more thinky television stories would scare away the viewers. A fact that makes me question if these studio people had forgotten that, when the series was cancelled half way through the first season, already avid fans wrote tons of letters to get the series renewed. So they replaced the Professor with Maggie. Now unlike alot of reviewers here I think Kari Wuhrer did a fairly good job becoming an interesting and integral part of the team considering that the whole point of her character was to show off her incredible figure as much as possible. And the episodes became more action packed and parodies of major motion pictures. I still liked several episodes, enough to keep my interest in the show.
This season was a slight return to the shows origins, alternate realities, although the action level remained high. They lost Wade, a fact that I am still fuming about, and the Quin's secret origins and his brother were story points that I could have lived without.
In conclusion I will recomend purchasing this to anyone who was a fan of this show. It was a fantastic concept that, if it had been left alone, might still be running today. Count this as another on a long list of television shows that were not given a fair shake by their studio.",1206403200,10,2307,4.727047146401985

Some of the very finest episodes of the series are in this season, presenting some novel sci-fi concepts and furthering the show's mythology.

There's an episode where an alternate Quinn accidentally slides his entire world away, an episode where all citizens are forcefully medicated by the government, an episode where the sliders are turned into computer data, and episodes dealing with themes as diverse as racial cleansing, reality television, an anti-Kromagg virus, the technological divide, cloning for body parts and rapid aging.

3300027,3,B0011FLGZQ,"The short first season of Sliders (10 episodes) was quite good! Just the right amount of humor mixed with interesting stories. But, beginning with season two, the series started to SLIDE in the wrong direction. Character development was placed secondary to repetitive plots. This trend continued in season three, four, and five.

Script problems aside, Sliders always remained an entertaining series, mainly because of the natural chemistry between the actors. In the end, a poor decision to make drastic changes to the cast finally destroyed all remaining integrity.

HUGE COMPLAINT:

$59.99 list price? What moron came up with that figure? Many more of these might sell at a $24.99 price point.

UPDATE; For a short time, Amazon dropped the pre-order price to $29.99, which was quite fair. The fact that Amazon slashed the price by HALF during the pre-order phase, tells me that sales were at a stand-still and they needed a quick jump start. At $59.99 it isn't surprising that nobody was buying!

* Only buy this one when it's on sale!

Packaged better than season three! Five single sided discs in a flip style case (Like Star Trek Deep Space Nine).

[Spoiler Warning]
The following paragraph reveals changes to the cast.

The series was never the same after losing John Rhys-Davies (Professor Arturo) and Sabrina Lloyd (Wade Welles). However, season four does represent a huge improvement in the plot/script department when compared to most of season three. After all, I don't think you can get much worse than ""The Fire Within"" or ""Slither"" (Season three).

3300030,5,B0011FLGZQ,"It took a big swift kick in the tush to get Universal Studios to FINALLY release season four of Sliders and now we fans own the DVD before they are all in their 70s and in rocking chairs! It was probably the studio's latest battle with the bootleg industry that finally got them listening.

Although this season lacked the humor of the other three seasons (I deeply miss John Rye Davies) this season has the most action of any other. Unlike any other season the Kromags were given a role as a group of villains identical to the Nazis. Many episodes were actually downright scary.

The very best episode of all is ""California Reich"", in which the sliders land on a world that still discriminates by race and surgically converts blacks into faceless beings called ""eddies"". The last part of this episode is really a shocker.

One very major change is the character of Cleavant Derricks. In the first three seasons the character ""Rembrandt"" was a bit similar to that of Stan Laurel with John Rye Davies' character, which was a bit like Oliver Hardy. In season four, ""Rembrandt"" is a completely new character, that of a very angry militant who vows revenge. It's hard to believe he is the same Rembrandt.

The lead actor, Jerry O'Connell, had his best season to date. Not only does he do well as Quinn, but he does extremely well as some very colorful atler egos. In the episode ""The Alternateville Horror"" he shows he has skill as a comedian when he plays a counterpart who is a spaced out hippie.

The only drawback to this season is another actor, Charlie O'Connell who, unlike his older brother, does not seem to have much acting ability. Evidently he did not have much acting experience. He started out as a fashion model. Charlie O'Connell was hardly a replacement for John Rye Davies or Sabrina Lloyd and seems to be there only to take up space, or rather, to fill a quota of four lead actors.

Although Kari Wuhrer was also originally there for a purpose other than acting (obviously to attract horny young men to the show) she truly  shows she has a LOT of acting ability anyway, despite what the producers originally intended her to do. She does a wonderful job and moved me with many scenes.

All in all, this is a great season to watch.

The portion of the cover hidden by the slipcase has episode information screened on it, which is nice and a first for this series. Video is Full Frame (1.33:1) as originally broadcast, and looks very good.  Audio is English Dolby Digital 2.0. There are English subtitles. Disks 1, 4, & 5 have 4 episodes each with disks 2 & 3 having 5 each.  From all appearances, ""missing scenes"" have been restored to the appropriate episodes.

Comments about the season:

Sliders moved from Fox to the Sci Fi Channel beginning with this season. The first episode garnered the highest premiere rating that the Sci Fi Channel had ever received up until that point.

We left our intrepid team (minus Prof. Arturo, plus Maggie [Kari Wuhrer]) at the end of season 3 with a damaged timer that doesn't track Rickman's wormhole.  This separates Wade and Rembrandt from Quinn and Maggie on different worlds.

We open season 4 as Quinn finally repairs the timer so it can track Wade and Rembrandt's photon trail to Earth Prime.  He and Maggie return to Earth Prime only to find it in the hands of the Kromaggs. Wade is kidnapped (off screen), Rembrandt is rescued, Quinn learns that Wade has been shipped ""off-world"" (actually an alternate Earth).

Sabrina Lloyd had left the show between seasons after friction on the set between her and Wuhrer led her to demand that Executive Producer David Peckinpah pick between the two of them. Peckinpah chose Wuhrer - and Wade was left to occasional mentions as a breeding host for Humaggs.  This was the plot device to explain her absense.

In the sixth episode of the season Charlie O'Connell (brother of Jerry) joined the regular cast (at Jerry's insistence) as Quinn's brother Colin for his only season. Can you say nepotism?

Season 4 is dominated by the Kromags as the focus changed from attempting to get home to one of freeing Earth Prime from Kromag control. It would be Jerry O'Connell's final year on the show. While the overall direction of season 4 *was* an improvement over that of season 3 I found myself growing indifferent as it progressed. What had started out as an innovative approach on a time travel motif appeared to be turning into just another Sci Fi Channel cheesefest.  I stopped watching about half-way into the season.

Now, having finally purchased and rewatched the entire season I stand by my comments. It *is* a bit better than the last half of season 3 but is not the best the show has to offer.  I *still* miss Arturo.  The episodes feel a bit ""less"" without his presence, and Wuhrer seems not much more than ""eye candy""... Dialog is frequently cheesy and trite with lots of ""recycled"" type plotlines.

I recommend season 4 only if you are a fan or if it can be purchased for less than a sawbuck (I got mine for half that).

So, the final tally is:
Set design/quality = 4
Sliders Season 4 = 2
Average = 3

10/21/11 - Season 5 has been announced with a January 17th, 2012 release date.  Early views of the package shows it to be identical to the season 4 but in blue this time and with single-sided disks.

I was just about giving up hope.

It makes it a little hard to support the buying of TV shows on DVD if you don't know if they whole series will ever be available for purchase.

I am still waiting for final season of Jeremiah, and the next for Simon & Simon as examples.

Please don't shaft us on releasing season 5 of sliders.",1198454400,4,384,4.219178082191781
8241792,3,B0011FLGZQ,"This show is always at its best when the episode is a stand alone.  Writers come up with a very creative idea for a world to land on, they arrive, figure out what is different on this world and deal with it.  Whatever the crazy world is, it is creative and what people watch sci-fi shows for, twists on reality.  This season has way too many recurring bad story lines.  Kromaggs are annoying.  1 episode of they would have been OK, having them over and over and having had them in Quinn's past is crazy.

Colin was a good addition.  As was Maggie. Changing cast was fine.  Just all these recurring stories that make the show boring.  Kill all the Kromaggs and go back to having every episode be different.",1515888000,,705,4.361538461538461

There are elements of the series that go off the original thread, but some of that was due to new writers and a change in venue.  For someone who wants to watch the entire series from episode one, it's fun, but for someone who is more interested in watching the original actors travel from one exotic location to another, it's pretty much the last season.",1472601600,,499,4.472527472527473
