5388595,5,B00A6SZRT0,"I'm one of those people whose mom loved Gunsmoke.  My parents both emigrated to the US from Germany, and they adored stories of the American West in the 1800's.  I had no idea, but apparently, the theme of settling the American WEst was a HUGE theme in Germany in the first half of the 20th century.  There was an author named Karl Mai, who remains the nest selling author to this day in the history of German language publishing.  So when my mom came to live with me in 2009, I made sure to stock up on all the Westerns she loved:  Wagon Train, Maverick, Gunsmoke, Bat Masterson, bunches more.  But Gunsmoke and Big Valley were her favorites.

and why?

Because beyond being setin the West of the 1800's, they were morality plays.  They were sometimes profound, and my personal favorite episode is entitled Coventry, about the power of social acceptance.  This is an amaing theme that is recurrent in Gunsmoke.

When I think of the Gunsmoke episodes I saw, the best ones aired between 1960 and 1964, I think.  Seasons 6-9.  he acting was outstanding, but the writing was beautiful.  Kathleen Hite, a pioneering woman writer of the era, wrote the majority of those episodes.  They are historically surprisingly accurate and informative and really profound.

So I say, buy this piece of American television.  It is excellent  Modern television can't come close, and we are ALL the poorer for it.",1485993600,,1394,4.713692946058091

5388614,5,B00A6SZRT0,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

5388708,5,B00A6SZRT0,In my opinion Gunsmoke is one of the all-time classic western shows. The shows are well written so the whole family can enjoy them.

5388725,5,B00A6SZRT0,"The final seventeen hour-long episodes of season seven (1962) of ""Gunsmoke"" continued the remarkably high standard of this long running, outstanding western drama series. Most of the episodes were in the sure hands of regulars Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew V. Laglen;  one exception is ""He Learned About Women"" directed by veteran feature film helmer Tay Garnett.  As in previous seasons the writers were mainly the ever reliable John Meston and Kathleen Hite.  Lots of really good female roles in this batch and some of the fine actresses featured include Joan Hackett, Barbara Luna, Bethel Leslie, Sue Ane Langdon, Dianne Foster and Ellen McRae (later known as Ellen Burstyn). Among the men, watch out for Edgar Buchanan, Claude Akins, Jeremy Slate, John Kerr, Andrew Prine, George Kennedy, Andy Clyde, Michael Parks, Arch Johnson and Conrad Nagel.
As always, faultless production values complimented the fine writing and acting in this wonderful series and we haven't even mentioned the brilliant ensemble of regulars - James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone. There have been many great western series but none ever topped ""Gunsmoke"" for high quality consistency.",1401062400,3,1185,5.32620320855615
5388726,5,B00A6SZRT0,"I purchased this DVD set for a single episode -- ""Chester's Indian"" -- that featured then 19-year old actress Jena Engstrom in the second of her two appearances on the Gunsmoke TV series.  Her first appeances was earlier that year as the Milly in the episode of that name that appears in the volume 1 of season 7 DVD set.  Jena Engstrom is a forgotten actress today.  I am her age but did not discover her work until a couple of years ago when I saw her in one of her three appearances on the Have Gun - Will Travel TV series.  Not everything she appeared in was good, but she was, and the two Gunsmoke episodes gave her two of her best roles in the 37 shows she did between 1961 and 1964 before giving up acting because of a nervous breakdown (to use the language of the newspaper artices of the time).  What I appreciated about Jena Engstrom was that each character was unique and that a character in one episode is unlike a character in another.  A thing I like about the Gunsmoke series is that the stories were character-driven and the series stars did not always have to be the main character in each episode.  I don't have a complaint about the series but in viewing them from today's vantage point it seems like Gunsmoke's Dodge City existed in some type of time warp -- the 20-years of episodes all took place in about 1872 while the characters Matt and Kitty and Doc aged 20 years.",1396742400,,1391,4.326923076923077

5388728,5,B00A6SZRT0,"Matt Dillion and company set the tone for this type of commarderie on television sets.  For those of us who grew up watching the black and white episodes, the series transition to color represents our own growth and development.  The shooting in the Gunsmoke series has a purpose that we all understood.  The bad guys had to learn a lesson.

5388750,4,B00A6SZRT0,"The re-mastered B&W episodes are clean and sharp for viewing enjoyment.  At $50 + per season, the series is quite pricy and would recomend only for the most diehard fandom of the Gunsmoke franchise.",1369008000,,198,4.823529411764706
5388751,5,B00A6SZRT0,"While some of the early episodes of Season Seven seemed to stuggle with filling the new 52 minute length, the writers responded and this last half of the season, they are clearly writing for a 52 minute show, and the brilliance of the first six seasons is back, throughout.  One of the most powerful episodes, to date, is included in this part of Season Seven (The Gallows), written by the great John Meston. I highly recommend not reading the episode synopsis of the shows in the case, as they tend to give away too much of the shows' plot.
At some point in the first-run of Gunsmoke, the shows started repeating themselves, and I lost interest, but I am nowhere near that point through seven seasons. Growing up without a TV until well into the ""Festus"" years, I had completley missed the ""Chester"" years, so am enjoying those, although Chester seems to be at a complete disadvantage against Doc Adams, whereas Festus always gave as good as he got.
My one and only complaint with this series is the extremely high price the company is charging for half-seasons. Lower the price and see sales soar!",1368835200,10,1099,4.635897435897436

5388755,5,B00A6SZRT0,"Gunsmoke is in a class by itself for someone like me, who remembers the series when it aired.  Many of the TV stories are rewrites of the radio versions, which too are still very engaging.  After season 9,  Chester leaves,  and Matt is almost always going to Hayes City at the start of an episode, so it is a very different program at that point.  But until then, the series is a real treasure, and one can be happy that CBS finally decided to release it before those that remember it the first time around are mostly gone.",1366329600,,523,4.295918367346939

5388757,3,B00A6SZRT0,".In my humble opinion, Gunsmoke was the greatest western of any sort ever made, movie or television.  There were no better characterizations anywhere and most of the episodic stories were real and believable.  James Arness' Matt Dillion is as whole an individual as John Wayne's Ethan Edwards  or Clint Eastwood's William Muny and has his flaws as well.  No other TV western, (and few TV dramas of any sort) ever came close to the quality of the characterizations of Gunsmoke.

That being said, the hour long Gunsmoke shows, to some extent changed the emphasis, and became almost a western showcase theater where the major characters; Matt, Chester, Doc, and Kitty, became supporting actors behind some guest star of the week. This weakened the show and lead to it's eventual decline. Folks wanted to see Matt Dillion!  I like the old half hour shows much better.

I will not buy any more Gunsmoke season discs because of the CBS' policy of charging twice for one season.  They can run and get the sheckles, but they'll get no more of mine.",1365811200,2,1040,4.770949720670391

5388780,5,B00A6SZRT0,"My wife and I love to watch Gunsmoke but we don't
understand why after 20yrs run of Gunsmoke that
there are just now 7 seasons released. At this rate
I won't be able to own and watch all of Gunsmoke. I
will be deceased long before they all get released.
Why, tell me why can't we get more Gunsmoke?

5388781,5,B00A6SZRT0,The studios do not make shows of this quality anymore.  Gunsmoke is westerns at their best. We went through Dodge City in December on a trip out west.,1360627200,2,150,4.357142857142857

5388783,5,B00A6SZRT0,I have the whole collection (so far) and can't wait for each of the new ones to come out. Gunsmoke is one of those series that you never get tired of watching them over and over. The transfer copies are great with the sound and picture. (First season is not as good as the others due to the year it started but that is the film itself and not the transfer.) My children and grandchildren enjoy watching them as much as I do showing that the series just didn't get outdated like most due. If you enjoy westerns you have to own this series. Very happy myself,1360195200,9,556,4.205607476635514

8547234,4,B00A6SZRT0,"The 7th season in my opinion was good but not excellent. A few episodes were fair to bad.
Example : Catawomper
The story heavily centers on 2 uninteresting, annoying guest star characters. The lady is so unappealing, and the boyfriend( Dick Sargent) trying to woo her is a horses behind till the very end. It almost felt like this was written to give the reg. cast some time off.
There are some outstanding episodes in this collection as well",1506988800,,442,4.6075949367088604
