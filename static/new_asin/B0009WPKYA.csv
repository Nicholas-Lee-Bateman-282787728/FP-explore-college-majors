2328547,5,B0009WPKYA,"I had Tivo'd Classical Baby from HBO and it was a stalwart choice for a longtime in our household.  In fact, it is the finest program we have discovered for our child.  HBO followed with Classical Baby 2 which is also outstanding.  Seemingly overnight, the format changed from ""CB"" 1 and 2 to the three part series: CB Music, CB Art and CB Dance.  These are basically rehashes of the original 2 with some extra material added.  My only issue is that this ""3 disc set"" contains all of 90 minutes of material (30 minutes each) - which could easily fit on one DVD - Twice!  Instead, people will pay more for the perceived material that would warrant three discs. Bottom line: these are outstanding programs.  I just wish it was packaged with same intelligence and consideration that went into the programs themselves.",1126656000,7,814,4.65034965034965
2328548,5,B0009WPKYA,"I've been watching Classical Baby on HBO during a preview and have fallen in love with it.

Aside from the beautiful illustations with each segment, I really enjoy that they seem to tell a story (it isn't just flashing colors and lights).

It will be nice once my child is old enough to encourage them to tell a story to match what is happening (such as the one where the Mommy and Baby hippo make lunch and do chores).",1125964800,5,419,4.291139240506329
2328549,5,B0009WPKYA,I love Classical Baby.  I too have Tivo'd this lovely show and it has held her attention and has soothed her in my daughter's time of need.  Thank you HBO I am glad you came out with this show. This is a must have for babies young and old!,1124755200,7,239,3.857142857142857
2328550,5,B0009WPKYA,"We recorded Classical Baby on HBO on our dvr, we have had it for many months and it has been the ONLY thing my daughter, now 18 months, will actually sit and watch for the whole length, if not more than once. When she is crabby or getting tired she likes to watch it, and I don't find it annoying yet. It's so cute! She likes to clap along with the animals in between the songs. I am very excited about this set coming out.",1124323200,4,423,3.988235294117647
2328551,5,B0009WPKYA,"My daughter is 7 months old.  I Tivoed this show when I saw it advertised.  I watched it with daughter later and we LOVE IT!  It is a part of our nightly routine before bed time.

I have a 16 disc collection of Einstein videos, butthis is far better!  The art is beautiful and the music is exceptional!  Unlike Einstein, it is the real classics as opposed to the Music Box Orchestra.

Each time I turn it on, my daughter focuses completely on it.  It is one of the few things an adult and child can watch together and enjoy.  I have pre-ordered the 3 disc set and can't wait till it is released.

I see this as a must-have for families.  Way to go HBO!!!",1124150400,4,654,4.111111111111111
2328552,5,B0009WPKYA,"We don't have the new 3-disc set that is coming out, but I am THRILLED to see this set coming!  We have TIVO'd the original Classical Baby from HBO and our son has been watching it for about 3 months now.  He is now almost 6 months and it is BY FAR his favorite thing--including all toys, etc.  We do watch a few other videos including sign language and Baby Mozart, but nothing compares to this.  He watches this every evening as part of his bed-time routine.

I can't wait for this to new set to come out and share it with our guy!

I have to add that it is really fun for adults to watch too.  The videos are very imaginative and the music is awesome.  My parents saw it for the first time when baby-sitting and they wanted a copy for themselves to watch!!!  Enjoy!",1123632000,5,768,4.135135135135135
2328553,5,B0009WPKYA,"I also had my TiVo on suggestions,  and the TiVO automatically recorded Classical Baby.  (I never read TV guides ,,,)

then I checked the tivo list and watched it,, it was sent from above!!!!! Truly a free gift!!!

  Classical baby is so cute,, the cartoons are great.

The artists put beautiful classical music to cartoons made from real art work...  Baby's First steps,, is a short cartoon about a little baby taking his first steps.  He is helped about by a clown and his pillow.  The music is Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies from Nutracker---Really Adorable... My  Madi Mari

( and I don;t like tv for kids) loved it,,

We started just listening to it at 2 monthes,,, and once she could sit better she still loves it and giggles to it!

 THe music is great since we listened to classical while she was in the womb.  But the cartoons with the Masterpieces are priceless.. Even better than Baby Einstein!

BUY IT NOW!  5stars!!",1123545600,3,929,4.527272727272727
2328554,5,B0009WPKYA,"I read about this video in the NY Times and set up my TiVo to record it from HBO.

If this is the same video, my daughter (6 months old) loves it.  The music is fantastic, the art and dance are exciting even fun and interesting for me to watch.

As I type this, my daughter is watching this in the other room and loving it.

I am not a fan of Television for babies, and this is the only thing that I let her watch.  We have the Baby Einstien series, and both, my daughter and I prefer Classical Baby.

I can't wait until all of the videos come out.",1122595200,3,548,3.891891891891892

2328611,5,B0009WPKYA,"I began playing these videos for my -then (2009)-1 year old and 3 year old as a way to calm down before bed.  It worked!  They loved them.  A few years later, when my oldest daughter was about 7, we went to the Art Institute in Chicago.  She actually remembered many of the artists names and a few of the paintings featured in the video.  That was not my intention, but I was amazed that she had learned something from watching these videos everyday.  My girls are now (2016) 8 and 10 years old.  Every so often they will stumble across these videos on HBO Family.  They instantly stop...and still want to watch them!  They hum the songs and compete with each other to guess the names of the artists.  This is an amazing and timeless gift!",1476489600,,739,4.328467153284672

2328614,5,B0009WPKYA,My daughter will turn 10 on Monday and I realized I've been watching this wonderful little program for 10 years! My daughter has grown out of it but my five-year-old son shows no sign of losing interest yet. I have a feeling it will be part of our life for quite a long time since it's become our go-to DVD before bed or whenever we need a calming distraction. This would make a wonderful gift for any new parent. I only wish that it was available online for streaming. Until then we'll keep playing the DVD. Highly highly recommend it (btw..Oswald the Octopus and Goodnight Gorilla and other sleepy time stories -Scholastic Storybook are other fabulous DVDs for children that stand the test of time),1474070400,,700,4.608

2328695,5,B0009WPKYA,"Bought these DVD's because I hate the music in Baby Einstein (too electronic) and was hoping to use these to expose baby to the ""classics"" during long car rides.  I really like the dancing DVD the best because it is hard to otherwise expose a toddler to classical dance without taking her to a performance, which obviously would be miserable for her, me, and other patrons.  I prefer the books ""Mini Masters"" over these CD's for the artwork.  But, in terms of ""educational"" DVD's I think these are some of the best.  And I like that the classical music is unadulterated.
So, I can't say that I ""love"" this, but I am giving it a 5 star rating because of all the ""educational"" DVD's out there for her age group these are the best for the subject.
It would be nice if HBO would continue this series to include other educational information such as seasons, days of the week, months of the year, numbers/letters, American wildlife and habitats, sports, science, etc.
I read and/or sing to my LO at bedtime (NO TV) and bought DVD's solely for the purpose of entertainment during long car rides.  So far these have kept her interest and she says ""oh no!""  when it ends.  Too bad each DVD is only 1/2 hour long so I have to make it repeat or pull over and change the DVD.  I wish these were all on one DVD so that they would be easier to handle in the car when there's only one adult (driver).",1441670400,,1386,4.344961240310077

This was one of the only things that would keep her attention at an early age.  The gentle pictures along with the music made for the perfect and developmentally appropriate combination.  You'll notice that they consulted with doctors and psychologists in the making of these DVDs.  It shows. They are perfect for first exposure to TV and personally, I think increase music and art appreciation :) Added bonus, it's not at all annoying for the adults in the room, even enjoyable.",1425254400,,645,4.836363636363636

2328748,5,B0009WPKYA,"Listen, This is my secret weapon. For some reason my 18 month old is OBSESSED with these videos. Maybe its the classical music or the colors. I don't know and don't really care. If she is going to be obsessed with something I'm really happy its classical baby and not Barney or something like that. Each child is different so I cant guarantee your child will love it but mine certainly does. Each DVD is about 30 minutes. We literally save them for when we need to do unpleasant stuff like give medicines or try to stop tantrums because she will stop everything.....SIT DOWN QUIETLY and watch all 30 minutes. I repeat SIT DOWN QUIETLY!!!! I mean this is gold!!! And the videos are really cute. Nothing crazy or out of this world but bearable unlike some other kid videos. Give it a shot.

It is also pleasant to listen to while you try to get somethings done while they are preoccupied.  Much better than listening to Dora or Barney.  I would rather get Classical Baby stuck in my head for the day than one of those.  They are now 5 & & YO and if I turn it on, they still sit & watch it.",1412380800,,410,3.776470588235294

2328779,5,B0009WPKYA,"As a preschool/ elementary music teacher, I appreciate greatly the value of exposing quality music to children from an early age! My kids, both boys, ages 2 and 4 (nearly 3 and 5) STILL love to watch these videos. My personal fave is the Art one (I love the way they animate the pieces of famous art to come alive for the kids.) My oldest loves the Dance video best. My youngest, the Music one. :) We also recently ordered the Poetry one, which they love as well. I love that it is experiential and not full of dialogue; they create their own story internally while watching. They often get up to dance as they are watching. When my now-4-year-old was under two, we had to fast forward through the Swan Lake/ Ugly Duckling portion of the ""music"" video because the mood of the music affected him so - he would turn to me with this pained, intensely sad look in his eyes. And his favorite is dancing with the Copland piece (and the dancing scarecrow.) My only dislike is the animation of the audience of animals - but my children love the animals. We buy at least one in this series for every family we know having a baby! A MUST MUST MUST purchase!",1408320000,,1147,4.339534883720931

You are able to experience the best combination of art & classical music.  As it stimulates the brain, it also relaxes the babies and those around having to hear it often(unlike some of that annoying musak with no point some kids are exposed to).",1405987200,,389,4.273972602739726

So, I liked the idea of having the cartoon baby's. However, it will not hold your baby's attention especially, I you baby has viewed other television programs like sprout or Disney.

As a former music education volunteer in the public schools, this program has it all: visual excitement, history, lovely classical music and a touch of fun for babies on up.  We began to use the videos when we were trying to calm our baby grandson before bedtime and now he requests it as dinner music and a cool down before bed at 5!

He's now five and he still loves to watch the kids talk about poetry and hear the songs that accompany it.  I decided to get the 3-Pack for his latest visit and he loved watching them...with the exception of Classical Baby-Dance.  I expected it to be much more modern, but the dances were disappointing out of date and the music from a long ago era to which neither my grandson nor I could relate.

I cannot BELIEVE there would be any negative reviews on this, especially from haters who just want to say how your child shouldn't watch TV.  Newsflash: there is a ton of awful stuff out there kids are watching.  This is not one of those shows.  My 2 year old knows the songs and asks for them outside of watching the show, and my husband can play the pieces and she knows them.  ""Cow song!""  ""Dancing ants Mommy!"" when she sees a Degas painting. It's amazing what they absorb and you want them to absorb the RIGHT stuff!  Love them.

2328851,1,B0009WPKYA,"I bought this DVD set when my first child was just under a year old.  He liked some of it, but started crying on one of the songs both times he watched it.  I put it to the back of the cabinet for a long time.  Now my oldest is 3 1/2 and my youngest is 25 months.  We all watched the dance show together and I must admit my 25 month old didn't want the show to end and my 3 year old enjoyed it also.  But my husband and I were disturbed by the animation.  The animals and illustrations are cute, but the way they move is terrible!  It hurts my eyes and almost makes me dizzy.  My husband begged me to trash the set!  I won't play this for my children ever again, despite the fact that it would give me 30 minutes of time to get something done around the house without kids hanging on me.  The music is nice and certainly not annoying.  But I just don't want my children exposed to that jumpy, fast animation.  Baby Einstein is wonderful for simply entertaining a young child.  If you want education, Preschool Prep Company has the BEST series for teaching letters, numbers, colors, shapes, and sight words.  Both of my children learned everything before they were two years old and they truly loved those DVDs with cute music and much slower moving images.  The whole time I watched this dance DVD I kept wishing they had filmed real dancers.  I have 2 concerts recorded from KERA and my children LOVE to watch the real orchestra and ballet dancers.  If you want to expose your children to classical music, there is simply no need to buy a baby version.",1357171200,,1553,4.263698630136986
2328852,5,B0009WPKYA,"We adore this DVD set. My son, who is now 3, watched them a lot as an infant and toddler, especially when we needed to calm and wind down or right before bedtime. In fact when we first transitioned him into his big boy bed (at around 2 and a half) he would watch one of these while settling in to sort of set the tone for sleep, and often he would fall asleep during it. He loved the wistful animations, and *I* loved the exposure he was getting to classical music, famous pieces of art, and important contributions to the world of dance. Hugely education and never overstimulating, these DVD's a great baby shower gift and a wonderful way to introduce young families to the arts.",1356825600,,680,4.362204724409449

The time when I brought it, she was about 1 years old and now she is about 2. She is still enjoying it. Whenever my wife and I want her to calm down or to cooperate with us, we said ""let's watch baby"" and she would be very happy to comply. We cut nails, feed her meals while she is watching The Baby. Watching the Baby has become one of the happiest time for her. Honestly speaking, I think the price tag is much lower than the value it brings. It is a bargain.",1354665600,,592,3.941666666666667

The illustrations are almost infantile themselves and can be hard on the eyes, with their wiggling blurry outlines.  I think my child just gets bombarded with confusing images and wants to look away.  The only plus is that there is classical music playing, but I can play that for him any time with pandora.",1345680000,,458,4.416666666666667

As babies, my girls loved to bob up and down to the music and watch the visuals. As a toddler and preschooler, they are inspired to dance, play music and even draw. We have a good time watching together (and dancing too). It's also nice background music.

My children sat and watched the whole set all the way through. It seemed to calm them down. I even caught my two year old ballet dancing to the music! I also found myself humming along. Now we watch them all the time and I enjoy listening while I do my household chores and the kids quietly watch and dance. It's a great product.,1343779200,,500,3.8173076923076925

What I can say is my 6 month son stops whatever he is doing the second this goes on the TV. He is all squirmy and fussy and boom Classical Music goes on the TV and he is captivated. If you need to buy 20min to do the dishes or get the laundry or whatever this is the savior tool.,1332979200,,424,3.8295454545454546

The Classical Baby series was a hit not only with my kids, but with me and my husband as well. The first thing I love about them is the choices of music featured in the DVDs. Then that each song has it's own story to go with it keeps our famiy entertained. I would recommend this collection to any music loving family. Plus, I've heard over and over how good classical music is for young children and babies.

The cartoons are engaging without being overstimulating to a little one, while the classical music that accompanies ranges from upbeat to soothing.  I was looking for videos that kept my daughter interested while I folded laundry, got cleaned up, etc., and these are right on the money. Unlike Sponge Bob and/or Dora, I've never tired of this series, and I am pleased to know that my little one has something more wholesome to watch than the aforementioned programs.",1328745600,,593,4.861386138613861

Which then lead to my sons new love of art such as stary night and other paintings they show. Since watching baby dance show, he now loves the nutcracker as well. I would say the only down side is the baby speaks ""in baby talk"" which i don't think is good for children, but otherwise these are lovely videos.

We also just got the poety and muisc one for christmas and they love those as well I love how they (my son now 3.5 and daughter 2) get up and dance to the muisc on all of them.",1328486400,,601,3.846774193548387

2328915,1,B0009WPKYA,"I was not impressed with this set at all. The images are fuzzy, so I assume it is not high definition, which is common now that it is 2012. When the series could be teaching things that are based in reality - instead of cows floating - they do not bother. The images depict more of a dream/nightmare than anything else - very much a poor man's Fantasia. Kind of like someone created a Fantasia knock off in their basement. I am not a doctor or specialist, but I also think the images move WAY too fast, and unnecessarily so, for a small baby's developing eyes and senses. My 3-month-old son actually started frowning and almost crying at certain points of watching the music DVD. Someone else commented that the introduction baby voice is very hard to understand and that is certainly true. To me, this is further evidence that the producers of this video didn't care about teaching a child anything useful and instead just wanted to create some lights and noise to occupy a child's attention for a time. I consider this set a waste of money and am surprised at the number of positive reviews.",1325462400,2,1093,4.525252525252525

Perfect for those fussy moments, those moments when you need a moment, and perfect for educating your baby on the famous composers music. we went to the mall and one of the songs from the dvd was playing on the piano in macys.

I first watched these on HBO a couple of years ago when I was babysitting my 18 month old grandson. We both loved them.  I recently purchased the set for my 7 month old granddaughter. She is fascinated with the music and visuals as well. Great product at a good price. Highly recommend.,1315094400,,386,4.5
2328923,5,B0009WPKYA,We got this as a gift and my daughter LOVES IT!!  She started watching it at about 3 months old and she still loves it and she is almost 7 months old.

Imagine my surprise when he didn't move for about 20 minutes and stayed focus on this. I decided to purchase this because if he liked it why not?

He likes all three dvds and watches them for the most part. He's very active so what I do is turn it on in his room so it's background music for play time. So he alternates between staying still watching it and running around playing with everything. I think these dvds are great because it does play the original music and not a babified version. It is relaxing to sit in his playroom with him and hear this playing. I'm not sure if I believe that classical music will make my baby smarter, but he enjoys it.",1313366400,,816,4.132075471698113

Our baby has loved these since he was just 2 months old... he's now 10 months and still loves them. I wish they made more. The production quality is so far ahead of Baby Einstein and the animation so refined and professional, they're in another league. And you don't need to stand there waiting for Baby Einstein's COUNTLESS annoying intro screens to get to the presentation. Classic art, music and dance so well presented, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this work has received many awards. Don't even think about this. Just get them.",1310515200,,650,4.8125

Now that they're older and harder to entertain when we have adult friends over, this show is proving to be a tv distraction that is also pleasant as background music!

We've enjoyed these so much I just bought the 3-DVD set for a couple upcoming summer trips we have planned. I can count on them entertaining my sons, while not annoying friends and family we'll be sharing vacation homes with.

Let me tell you, after about 40 jobs in this age category (I specialize in vacationing families)- this DVD is absolutely one of the biggest hits!  It can turn an unhappy 3 or 4 year old who wants his mommy or daddy, into a calm, happy, and wistful child.  I love to say things like :  ""look, see the mommy, daddy and baby"" and it just calms them immediately.  The scenes are all different, with cool shapes or faces or baby animals - bees,  everything is in this series.
One scene I'll admit I don't like is the ""ugly duckling"" where the chick is rejected and a tear comes down, but later he is ""accepted"" because he becomes beautiful.  I'll admit, I personally have to forward that because it makes me cry!!  I must be sensitive.

I just showed to 3 and 4 year old boys who spoke NO ENGLISH - and let me tell you - THEY LOVED IT!!!!  The 3 year old saying ""mommy, poppy, baby"" was sooooooo cute with his German words..  It calmed them and made them very relaxed.",1307491200,,1118,4.216981132075472

My 5-month-old loved them so much I went ahead and purchased the dance and art ones, too. I hate occupying my baby's time with television, but this series is calm and lovely and not annoying in the least. I don't mind it playing in the background, and sometimes, it is the only way to entertain my son so I can get some things done. He's seven months now, and a few weeks back he had some nasty croup. In the middle of the night, he was bawling and coughing and in general hysterical. Absolutely nothing I tried would calm him down, so as a last resort, I turned on the Classical Baby. Right away, he calmed and watched his program, falling asleep to it. I don't know how the producers of the program know what babies want, but this one is a for-real genius program! There are tons of baby shows, but none does it for my son like this one. I hope it works for others, too!",1306972800,,971,4.197860962566845

When we sit down to watch this video, which has both classical and modern classical mucsic, with terrific colored animation, animated classical art reproductions, I am not sure which of us enjoys this more.  It has 3 dvd's in the pack.  I could not describe this better than they did on the HBO website, so I just copied and pasted it here---all true:

""From the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning producer of ""Goodnight Moon & Other Sleepytime Tales,"" HBO presents a delightful half-hour animated special for small children and their parents. Winner of a Peabody Award and three Emmy Awards and ingeniously designed to introduce young children to masterpieces of classical music, painting and dance, ""Classical Baby"" is a creative kaleidoscope of color, motion and music, played out in an accessible, comforting format. The program's premise involves a diapered baby ""conductor"" who leads an all-animal orchestra though imaginative renderings of short (2-3 minute) musical pieces, all played in front of a rapt animal audience. Each segment features iconic music from some of the world's great composers, including Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Johann Sebastian Bach, Erik Satie, Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Robert Schumann, Johann Strauss, Georges Bizet, Giacomo Puccini and Claude Debussy. Through this inspiring music (performed by some of the world's great musicians), the segments also pay imaginative tribute to the art of Claude Monet, Joan Miro, Fernand Leger and others, as well as the dances of choreographers like George Balanchine.
Stimulating, soothing, and full of heart, ""Classical Baby"" fulfills the potential for TV to inspire and engage a baby's imagination and sense of wonder, while serving as a wonderful tool for family bonding.""

This is a great video to watch when a little ""quiet"" time is needed.  All you grandpas and grandmas out there understand this.  A great value for the price.------Vincent",1303603200,,1970,5.298076923076923
2328977,5,B0009WPKYA,"While my granddaughter spent her first five months of life in the hospital one of the father's there shared this DVD with me and my Marisa and she absolutely loved it. Even at a few months of age she was enjoying this. Now at home she watches it at least a few times a week. We have the Einstein collection but this really has the better classical music set to the animation. Very highly recommend this.

It is beautifully made. The music and animations are captivating even to the adult in the room. As soon as my niece walks in the door, she asks me to put the DVD on,begins dancing and proceeds to give her best rendition of Mozart's 'piano concerti'. My daughter is 6 months old now and this is the only thing that seems to calm her when she's fussy. I put it on and instantly she is mesmerized by the music and lovely imagery. She loves the Dance Show... she squeals and babbles constantly while watching it!

There is nothing obnoxious or annoying about these. I can't stand Little Einsteins and some of those other supposed classical music shows. This is just great, enjoyable music with really well penned animation. There is a baby conductor and an animal audience, very cute. It doesn't make your kids more stupid, like some of the other junk out there, I feel like it is at their level and fun for all babies and toddlers. all three are great. I wasn't crazy about the separate poetry one, same nice cartoons, but just not as interesting.",1299369600,,712,4.5703125

She watches the Music one every night before she goes to bed and during the day, we periodically watch the art and dance video's as they are more upbeat and she loves them.  We still watch Baby Beethoven and Mozart occasionally, but these are in heavy rotation.

(We didn't let her watch anything at all till she was 2 as the AAP recommends and I didn't even hear about Classical Baby until just this month.) I rented it from the library to see if she would like it, which is what I do now with everything before buying because there are a lot of popular programs she doesn't care for, such as Baby Einstein. But she really likes it so I bought it.

After only seeing it a few times, as we were decorating our Christmas tree she heard ""Dance of the Reed Flutes"" from the Nutcracker ballet on my Christmas music mix, and she rushed over to the TV because that's one of the songs used in the Music video.

I love classical music myself so I'm really glad for anything that will help her appreciate it too! And these videos have a very good selection of pieces, pleasant enough for even non-classical fans to be okay with. I'm even going to be buying some of the renditions used in the videos that I like better than what I have, such as ""Clair de Lune"" featuring clarinet (which I play), and ""O mio babbino caro"" as sung by Ying Huang. They only play short clips from most of the pieces, which jars me sometimes because I know they're not supposed to stop yet. But that's no biggie and the animated shorts are very cute. While she's watching it she'll give a really cute running narration of what's happening (like, ""cow singing!"").

Speaking of animating to classical music, this has inspired me to play some of the lighter fun selections from Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 for her too.",1292198400,2,1609,4.338870431893688

I started introducing them to my son when he was about 8 months old.  He liked it right away, but he couldn't sit still for too long before being distracted by something else, which was normal for his age.  Now that he's 11 months old, on a good day he can sit through the entire 30 minute.  What I really like about them, besides the beautiful animation and music everybody has already raved about, is that I as a parent can control how long my son should watch, and the that I as a parent learn about music, dance, and art along with my son.  The selection was comprehensive, covering both classical and some modern arts/music.  They are a set to be enjoyed for a long time.  I would highly recommend them",1289606400,,856,4.253086419753086

They are soothing, not obnoxious, and are well-suited for young babies as well as older ones. It is a great introduction to the arts as well as a welcome babysitter! I often keep the music show on in the background. They are a great value for the price; we also have Baby Einstein which is fun, but is way too pricey.

You can preview parts of this DVD on YouTube - which is where my then 3 month old son would first view these scenes.  A favorite was ""Bear Hugs"" - where a mother/father polar bear and a baby polar bear play together in the snow. It is heartwarming and beautiful.  Once we got the DVDs we were greeted with more gentle and unique scenes like ""Baby's Hands"" which shows a baby playing with toys from the baby's perspective.

On Dance favorites are a recreation of ""West Side Story"" and ""Dancing Sheep to Sheep"".  In Art you will be entertained by well-known works of art, it is exciting and beautiful.

I found them and ordered them from Amazon. He  was only 13 months old but as soon as he heard the music again he went and cuddled quietly in front of the TV. He sits still for the entire DVD, it is a perfect tool to settle him down before bedtime and he just loves them all. The DVDs are a combintaion of classical poetry, music, art, illustrations - they are a joy to watch and it is amazing how he is transfixed when they are on. I bought a second set to share with friends! Also buy the individual DVD on Poetry.",1285718400,,669,3.9925373134328357

2329044,5,B0009WPKYA,"I recently purchased the Classical Baby DVD series for a baby shower gift.  We already owned them because I had individually purchased the DVDs for my daughter when she was a toddler.  She loves all of them, and in fact, her older sister has enjoyed them too.  Although they are older now, they both still enjoy watching them, and often they will watch them in the car because I like listening to the classical music in the background.  I especially love the Dance one, but all three are excellent. We also have the Poetry one which came out later, and is good too, but one criticism is I think there's too much talking and interviewing the children in between reciting the poems.  I like the original Music, Dance and Art series because it highlights and teaches children the classics of each of these art forms in an entertaining way.  I think it is an amazing gift for any family with young children.",1284336000,,903,4.54320987654321

I started showing it to my son at around 3 months old, and it has been a life saver!  For starters, he would watch it while sitting in his jumpy, and it held his attention for the entire show - a full 30mins! As he's grown older - now 9.5months old, I turn on Classical Baby for him to watch while he's finishing his bottle or eating his meals.  This is the only way I can get him to eat nowadays; otherwise he's too busy or distracted.  It's really the only thing that keeps his attention and completely relaxes him.

I haven't shown him the Dance nor Art since I thought he might be too young for it still.  My toddler is a very very active one and doesn't stay still for a minute, but when I turn this on, he'll watch the whole thing.  It is quite amazing!!  He'll clap with all the animal audience and will want a hug when he sees the ""Bear Hug"" segment.  He will conduct with the conductor during ""Night Music"".  It is such a joy to watch him watch this DVD.
Also, my almost 5 year old twin nieces came over and enjoyed watching this with my son.
I think each segment has the right amount of music so the babies/toddlers do not get bored with it.  The animation is simple, yet very cute and captures my son's attention.",1277424000,,842,4.091463414634147

It beats what's on television, and they become familiar with classical music and dance at the same time.  The dance show is outstanding. I have seen some of the choreography that ""inspired"" the animation,and it's right on -- particularly the Appalachian Spring Martha Graham (Mom's favorite) and the opening segment of West Side Story (babies favorite along with the mambo).

My two grandchildren love it and look forward to rest or bed time because we watch and listen to these brilliant, informing, soothing and entertaining works of art.  My grandson was a three year old little boy that could hardly sit still for a minute when the Classical Baby Music came on HBO.  He was playing and stopped in his tracks when he heard the music and turned around and stood watching it as though he was immobile.  My 1 1/2 year old granddaughter did the same.  They loved it and would ask to see it over and over.  I went online and googled it, it showed up on Amazon.com and I ordered the set.  It is now one of my favorite new baby gifts!

My little boy loved to watch it and it is easy to watch as an adult too. When my brother was expecting in September of last year I could not wait to give them the dvd set for Christmas. It helps to calm a baby and relieve a tired parent. Recommend it 100% to everyone.,1266364800,,417,3.75

I'm a musician and I really appreciate the fact that it uses the sounds of the real instruments, as opposed to the synthesized sounds that are used in almost every other baby music DVD. Anybody interested in their babies experiencing music the way composers intended it should get these DVDs! The visuals are beautiful and creative, and the exposure to painting and dancing, classic and contemporary, is fantastic. It's alright that my 5 months son prefers some chapters to others, it helps me learn about his personality and temperament. Recommend it 100%.",1266278400,,720,4.861788617886178

2329078,5,B0009WPKYA,"OK, I know they are designed for babies, but I LOVE watching all 3 DVD's. This program, initially created for HBO, is a fantastic way to introduce your babies and children to classical music, art work through the ages, and dance, both ballet and modern. All three DVD's are engaging and beautifully done. The animation is excellent. I found watching them reminded me of Disney's Fantasia. I have given this DVD collection to friends with babies - my friends tell me their babies are mesmerized by the DVD's, and like me, they enjoy watching them as well.

I know that I have a love for the arts because classical music was played in my home growing up. These tapes are a great way to ensure the next generations grow up to love classical music as well. For any of you who aren't as familiar with classical music, the selections are very accessible.",1264550400,,848,4.578947368421052

Regardless, the fact that each 30 minute DVD is entertaining and keeps the kids attention with it's animations and highly entertaining animal audience is well worth buying this for the simple fact that it teaches an early appreciation for classical music.  Most teens and adults would deem ""classical"" music as dull and tune it out, but this DVD series creates a positive association from an early age and may help them to give more varieties of music a chance in the future.

The art and animation are simplistic and cute and at times funny.  We enjoyed spending an afternoon together watching these DVDs!",1257984000,,722,4.736

While I am still not so sure about sitting my infant before it yet, my three-year-old has loved this series for more than a year.  It is the most creative, visually and auditorily pleasing set of children's videos I've ever seen.  Last week when a famous classical music piece came on the radio, my three-year-old lit up and exclaimed: ""Mama!  I like this!  Classical Baby!""

The animation is fantastic, the classical music is fantastic, and they are just fun - even for us.

Please, if you buy any DVD's, get these.  I've bought her Baby Einstein dvd's and they just don't capture her attention the way these do.  You'll love them.",1255046400,,546,4.41

These DVD are really something else, our 14 months old daughter enjoyed the music and the animation very much, she keeps pointing subjects while watching them so we can describe and explain what's going on. She also likes to applause at the end of each show and I find that really cute.
I admit that my husband and I are big fan of classical music and concerts but even if your not I bet you'll like the music and the animations.

2329112,3,B0009WPKYA,"I and my little boy are connoisseurs of educational videos for little kids, and after all the positive reviews here, and seeing some choice ones on YouTube (which we liked), I can't say we loved this that much (after we bought the three-DVD set).  My boy, who really loves classical music and has been exposed to a lot of art, just didn't like this so much.  There are certain individual vignettes (or whatever they're called) that he likes, but we watch them more on YouTube than we do on the disks that we now own!

Now, I'm giving this production 3 stars because it's very professionally done and has a lot going for it.  Your mileage may vary and I can certainly see how other kids would like it.  But I think the problem we had with it is that we kind of expect things to make sense, and a lot of the vignettes didn't make a lot of sense.  They were arty for their own sake, like the one that went with ""Starry Night,"" and seemed more puzzling than anything.  You might argue that this is art and so it's supposed to be deep and subtle, except that the title is ""Classical BABY,"" and babies and little kids don't really get arty subtle stuff.  No offense to anybody, I hope, but I get the impression that the production was made and is consumed by parents so that they can feel proud that their little ones are being exposed to sophisticated Art.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that as an aim (like I said, I've exposed my little boy to a lot of classical music and art), but I think this production will appeal more to parents than to babies.  That was certainly our experience.  But, again, other people here obviously had a different experience from ours...",1248652800,2,1668,4.400651465798045

When I found this three-pack of DVDs, I jumped right on this. It's a steal of a bargain, and the content on all three DVDs are perfect for teaching toddlers/young children about classical music, impressionist/post-impressionist artwork, and dance.

Wanted to preview it & see if it was something I liked for my baby (he's 2 mos now) to watch when he was a bit older. At first we only got the music show but apparently there's 2 more music shows b/c now I have parts 1 & 2 & they're different from the original music show. But all 3 are AWESOME. Also love the dance & art shows but music is by far my fav. I put these on in the mornings after he's had his first bottle of the morning & I need to get ready. He does seem to like the music & the images are very fun for me to watch. I enjoy the music as it's not baby versions of the classics (my husband always wanted to know why people bought us baby mozart or baby bach cd's & not just the regular music)...after seeing this series I won't be buying the Baby Einstein videos...I was going to because I had seen them before but at $50 a pop, these are much more affordable. And the baby conductor is SO cute. LOVE 'EM! Can't wait til my baby is older & can enjoy them properly. :)",1238803200,,1051,3.847926267281106
2329120,5,B0009WPKYA,"Mom (age 88) loves music videos, classical mostly, and she loves babies and animals, so realized right off the bat that this cute set would be perfect for her. Mom has mid-late stage Alzheimer's, and she can't resist conducting along (which is not good when I take her to the SF Symphony!...Poor Brahms!(.

From the very first second, we fell in love with the set. Halfway through the Music one, two neighbor boys age 7, came over to get something to eat from the goodie drawer. As they were snacking on chips, they were totally captivated by the video, and laughed and commented in all the right places. I was surprised they did not recognize any of the pieces, totally unfamiliar. That's not the way we were raised, as we had 78s then 33 LPs by the dozens, and we kids put on albums and conducted the speakers in the living room.

So, if you have a senior who can't get out much, try putting on these videos. Studies have found that dementia patients will respond to the deeper aspects of music and art even when other facilities fade away.

Really these three are all classical music videos, but some feature clever dance sequences, the art one features unique inspiration from dozens of pieces of famous art. This can also be opportunity for senior to ""chair dance"" and conduct along...extra exercise. Perhaps useful for Alzheimers wards and nursing homes?

Sure Mom will enjoy seeing them again and again. Memory loss has its advantages sometimes.

I always hoped that I will have a tool like these three pieces to introduce to my child things that I myself love so much. We are dancing and applauding to every number.  I just wish there was more of these. In this modern age, despite most parents' desperate attempts to limit their infants and toddlers time in front of tv, it is hard to exclude it altogether.

The images are so pretty...whether it is a painting, abstract shapes to music or dancing animals.  We sit together and I explain the videos to her, they are short enough (20-30 min) so that you don't have the child in front of the tv for a long time.  The format is similar for all videos but there is variation in the audience (animals shown with babies), etc.  If your little one likes it...they will notice the differences.

2329149,5,B0009WPKYA,"My daughter, Addison, has been watching the Classical Baby since she was 5 months old. I ran across it one day on HBO and immediately ordered the series for her. She loves all of the DVDs. We put in the Art Show at bed time. It is very relaxing for both of us. She loves all of the music and hums along with the tunes. She is now 13 months old and we still have not found any other series that she loves more. I highly suggest it to all. It is also wonderful to listen to the classical music rather than some hokey tune that you will be singing throughout the day.",1223856000,,564,4.0
2329150,5,B0009WPKYA,"My son loves to watch these great short cartoons set to wonderful pieces of music.  He took to this right away, and it made us feel good that if he was going to watch 30 minutes of tv, at least he was being exposed to classical music, famous works of art, and dance.  I highly recommend these dvd's, more so than Baby Einstein or any other programming for babies.",1222732800,,363,4.246376811594203

Their movements are gracefully filled with a non-verbal communication of the enjoyment of life and being in the moment.  The characters seem genuinely pleased to be in one another's presence.  These cartoons not only introduce children to classical music, but show them how they can feel the complex works moving through their bodies.
I believe these will stand the test of time.  As a an adult looking back on shows I liked as a child I feel disappointed in the way many of them took advantage of my ignorance, and seemed to be more than they really were.
Do a search on youtube for 'classical baby' and see if you can find some animation clips to help you make up your own mind about how these DVD's  make you feel.",1221868800,,785,4.539007092198582

i have to disagree with a previous reviewer.  each video is different, different songs, different ""stories"" - just the same characters (animals).  the baby is a little hard to understand, but he doesn't talk much anyway.

no matter what's going on and how upset he may be, when we turn on these videos (even today at 2yrs old), he immediately stops and watches them with intensity.  he absolutely loves them!!

I thought he might be a little too young yet to sit and watch a video, but after putting them on once a day for a couple of weeks he soon took interest. He will now sit through most, and sometimes all, of one of the 30 minute videos, completely entranced. He likes some of the cartoons more than others and will smile, laugh, and point at those. His favorite part is the scenes of the animal audience clapping between numbers. I have found the cartoons to be beatifully done and appreciate the fact that the music is not dumbed down to music box versions. It's all full on orchestral, and some really lovely and interesting selections. We usually watch one video a day and I am still finding them very enjoyable, not at all grating as some kiddie videos can become. The cartoons and music are really pretty relaxing.

One previous reviewer mentioned something about repeating footage between the three videos, but I haven't seen that at all. Certainly all of the cartoons are completely different. You will always go back to the animal audience between numbers, but even those segments are all different (trust me, I've watched them all enough times now to be sure).

I would very highly recommend this set of videos to any parent, even more so than any Baby Einstein video, which seem kind of cheap in production quality in comparison.",1204070400,6,1389,4.596774193548387

Trebellina actually teaches babies to read written music. It introduces notes, as well as instruments and the sounds they make. It has all different types of music -- some original and really foot stomping from an adult's point of view. Classical Baby does not even really purport to teach a child much of anything substantive about music.

My daughter is now 3 1/2 years old and I have an 18-month old.  They both love to watch and get so excited when I mention ""baby show.""  My  18-month old likes to dance and clap with the music and characters.  My older daughter now understands the story line behind each song and we can talk about the video and what she sees while we watch.  Each disc has 8+ individual songs - from slower and dreamy to upbeat and moving. The art and stories are so fanciful in each of the three videos.

2329238,5,B0009WPKYA,"I own around 20 Baby Einstein videos (bought the DVD collection), some Baby Genius and some Brainy Baby too. After watching them a lot, I can be certain than HBO's Classical Baby is the very best baby video ever made. Why?
* The music is played by an actual orchestra, not by a computer like similar products. This makes the video a really listening pleasure, even for adults.
* Music selection is wide, not just classical music, many contemporary and world music pieces are present, even jazz and mambo. The kind of music that will make your child smarter.
* The animations are so beautifull that I don't mind my baby watching it over and over. The replay value of this video set is huge.
* When my baby don't want to eat, I put any of these videos and problem solved, by baby eats anything I put in his mouth, even adult food.
* When my baby don't want to sleep, I put these videos and he get relaxed, and it is easier to take him to bed.
* The animations are based on real life art pieces, so you are giving a lot of culture to the baby. When I took my baby to a real museum, he felt as in home.
* Dance scenes are a pure work of art, they touches my soul every time, incredible choreography.
* It does not matter the language (english only), this is all about music.
* I played this video to my newborn since he was 3 month old, and now he is 16 month old and still his favorite. I also played this video to nephews and neices between two and eight years old, and all of them were glued to the tv.
* This production is unique. All competition looks similar when compared to each other, but HBO Classical Baby looks really different from other baby videos available. So if you are looking for variety, buying a cople of Baby Einstein, a cople of Baby Genius and some other Brainy Baby, your are not really buying different things, they all look alike.

Finally I would like to add that the reviewer that said that these 3 videos had the same content ""is wrong"", only the introduction is the same, but all the content from each video is original and related to the title, so Music in mainly Music, Dance is about dancing, and Art is about paintings and sculptures.

My baby was 15 months old when I purchased them and that turned out to be many months too old. I'm not sure if my boys would have appreciated it at that age, but there was not much to hold my little communicator's attention. The dvds were entirely unoffensive to me, but as surprised as I was to read customers buying them for babies only weeks old, I am sure that they are best suited to the under 1 year set or perhaps a very quiet natured baby. My baby is not used to much visual media, still,  after 3 viewings her preference remained our only other child dvd:  ""Ruby and Max Christmas"" dvd. In fact, she spent less than 30 seconds at any given time watching the slow-moving animation. The dvds provide short clips of familiar and soothing background music, but listening to the CBC holds her attention longer than ""Classical Baby"".

I like the concept of classical baby more than the concept of the other similar DVDs available; Baby Einstien.

The shows feature absolutely amazing images of music, art and dance and also show all kinds of important concepts - linking the beat of a musical piece to action, linking music to images, showing cause and effect, showing images of friendship, creativity, parental love, etc. There's really nothing in these shows that doesn't stimulate the mind or the senses in some way. I also love that the music pieces are real music by real musicians, and are not just classical pieces - the shows feature snippets of jazz songs, opera, etc.

We want to expose our son to art and music from an early age, both to develop his aesthetic sense but also to encourage him to make art and music of his own. I really can't think of a better way to introduce concepts of art and music appreciation than by showing Classical Baby. As long as people use common sense and don't use TV as a babysitter, there's nothing wrong with using TV on a limited basis to introduce concepts and expose children to culture.

My one year old was sitting down one day and i was looking for a cartoon she would like when we stumbled across the hbo special classical baby, she got up right away and started clapping and dancing along to the music, since that day around bed time we turn on the television to watch and before i know it she is sound asleep. now six months later she is still watching and now she is dancing and conducting along with the baby as well as calling out shapes and objects she recognizes. i totally recommend this video to all new moms...it is truly lifesaving....!!!!!!",1168905600,,750,4.442028985507246

I decided to buy the dvd, and I am glad I did.  She absolutly loves the Mambo, and dances to it everytime she hears it.  She loves all the animals. We have watched the baby einstein movies with her before, but she didn't seem interested.  Her preference is definatly Classical Baby.

For me that includes the arts - music, dance, theatre, as well as the visual arts.  I always thought that would begin when the boys were older, so I was pleasantly suprised to find Classical Baby on HBO while watching television during my maternity leave. I quickly purchased the set of three DVDs - Dance, Arts and Music and my family has been enjoying them ever since. My boys (twins now 6 months old) are facinated by the music and images and I am impressed by the quality of the presentation and the diversity of the artists represented. I soon realized that it's never too early for exposure to the arts. I highly recommend this series to all parents of newborns.",1168473600,,772,4.468085106382978

For a while, the only way I could get him to sleep at night was to put it on while he was swinging.  He is now 14 months and continues to love it.  When he hears the music start he comes right in and watches, dances and hums to it.  As far as the content--it is very cool, I can't even pick a favorite because we like them all so much.  The music and the animation ties together very well.  It is an early introduction of  classical music and artwork, which in my opinion are very important.

While she laughed at some of the puppets in the Baby Einstein videos, she was mostly unimpressed. It was a completely different story with the Classical Baby video. As soon as the music came on, she was dancing along with it.

She and I loved the video so much that we had to buy the entire collection. Each of the videos focuses on a different aspect of the arts: dance, music, and art. The pieces of music are gorgeous (very good recordings), and the animations are lovely. I think of these videos as a Fantasia for babies.  What I especially love about the videos is that they are highly interactive.

I am not a proponent of allowing babies to watch television, however they feature classic historic music, dance and artwork pieces that are very educational for your child.

Two minutes into the show, we were mezmorized and sincerely enjoyed the music and the animation.  I like how the segments are short, they don't go on and on; good for little minds.  The little baby conductor and animal characters are very age appropriate and add a touch of whimsy. A lot of creativity is behind Classical Baby, it looks like the creators had fun.  Being a music educator, I HAD to have these on DVD!  I went and ordered them the next day!  My baby won't arrive for 6 weeks, and I can't wait to watch this with him!

I prefer these to the baby Einstein DVDS - as I like the music better & the introduction to the Masters (the art show features work that are taken from Van Gough, Monet, Picasso & more!). My son is now 13 months. He is through that fussy stage (yay!) - but still loves Classical Baby. He recognizes the music when it comes on the radio & smiles.

2329351,5,B0009WPKYA,"I know there are opposing views out there regarding children watching videos/television; I swore I would not have my child be exposed to it early. Well, I was not expecting to have such a visual daughter; it was apparent in my 13-week old since she was practically out of the hospital. I figured I'd rather have her watch something worthwhile than be mesmerized by the tv (which she is).

So I ordered these DVDs now instead of waiting until she was older. First, you can't beat the price. Second, she's already watching them and sometimes will keep her attention span for the entire 30 minutes. They're the perfect length without giving your child too much exposure. Now that she's at daycare and I'm back at work, I reserve them for the weekends (which means she sees them about twice a week).

What I like most about these DVDs (I first saw them on HBO while I was pregnant) is that they use actual performances of the classical works, rather than some synthesized baby music that I can't stand (and she doesn't respond to).

As a musician, I like the themes of each DVD, along with the clever animation for each piece. I especially like the Dance DVD. Enjoy ""The Rectangles"" set to music from ""West Side Story"". What I truly like about the Music DVD is that all of the classical music (and from all of them, in fact) is very recognizable, so even someone who is not familiar w/the composers and their music will know the pieces. Although the Art DVD is not as ""active"" as the other two, it merges art w/classical music, and hopefully, some day, my daughter, on her first trip to any art museum, will somehow ""recognize""what she has seen before.

At any rate, for this price, give them a shot. And if you don't like them, you haven't wasted much money, and you can regift it to someone who will appreciate them. We do in our household!",1141948800,4,1838,4.51051051051051
2329352,4,B0009WPKYA,"It is hard to compare these videos to Einstein because they are totally different. I have four BE's (Galileo, Monet, Neptune and McDonald). I like that BE uses real stuff. Even the puppets are ""real"". Classical Baby is all animation, and after only 2 months of BE it was an adjustment to watch CB. That said, there are many things I like about CB. They use the actual musical pieces with full orchestras. They are short segments. If you or your baby don't like the one that is on, wait 90 seconds at the most and another one is playing. I like the ""audience"" made of animals and the animal sounds you hear while they are shown. I like the wide variety of music that is used (classical, opera, big band and others). Once I got past the different style from BE, I do like the animation. It reminds me very much of the first half of Fantasia, very light and easy to watch. I like that when you first put the DVD in there is not a bunch of ""junk"" to go through before the menu comes up, and once you push play the actual show starts (not more ads). But...I still don't know how my 14 month old daughter is going to take to them. It took her 3 weeks to get into BE and sit still to watch them. We have only had CB for a few days. So far, CB has been background TV and music during play time. If she decides she likes them, I would raise my rating to a 5, but the jury is still out (napping, really).",1141603200,4,1394,4.072727272727272

For me, I can play a video and listen to beautiful classics from the kitchen/next room instead of listening to whiny, high-pitched squeaky noises that are characteristic of children's videos.

If you like Baby Einstein (which are great also), you will love this 3-pack DVD set. I hope they come out with more that will cover similar learning topics such as those covered by Baby Einstein.

Her favorite DVD is The Dance Show and gets a real kick from the segment titled ""The Barn Dance"". Her eyes don't leave the screen even when our dog, Tequila, walks into the room, which under normal circumstances would totally distract her.

The DVD's are great, both for children and adults. I get a real kick out of it and I must admit,you learn a couple of this or two. The music selections are universal. The dancing covers almost everything: ballet, contemporary, tap, mambo. The Art Show (my fave!), is spectacular. Even when my daughter falls asleep watching it, I keep on going because it is just so clever!! It's no surprise that it was nominated for an Emmy.

This is a pleasant enough experience for the entire family to enjoy over and over again.

One feature I wish the DVD's incorporated would be the Baby Einstein's ""repeat play"" feature, because 25 minutes is over quickly.  We enjoy some of the Baby Einstein DVD's out there, but this Classical Baby series is by far everyone's favorite.

When he's happy and awake... we sometimes keep Classical Baby in the background just for us. He plays and does whatever while sometimes looking back at the tv and dances.

When he needs to be calmed down (like when he's sick)... he'll just sit in my lap and watch. I am so happy HBO produced these.

I was one of those parents who was dead- set against their baby watching television but when you become a parent any distraction that can give you some kind of break is VERY NECESSARY. With HBO's classical baby, I have the guilty pleasure of entertaining my infant with slow moving, brightly colored images which is great for her eye development without the worry of seizures while exposing her to the arts at the same time. And it doesn't hurt that I can finally get to those dishes now or a take a breather also its great for putting them to sleep too.

I decided to try to find it on DVD for Christmas and I am surprised at how reasonably priced the boxed set is.

2329408,5,B0009WPKYA,"I was all about the Baby Einstein series until I saw HBO's Classical Baby series - it's SO much better! Why?

1. The music is the real deal, not a ""baby"" version. In addition to a ton of classical music, there's also Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Mambo, etc.

2. The animation is really cool! My husband is an artisit & he loves Classical Baby - he refuses to put on Baby Einstein when he's home.

3. It's WAY cheaper! I spent $20 dollars for THREE videos instead of $45-60 for three Baby Einstein.

4. Besides music, it also has famous art & dance

5. It's a lot more interesting for parents!

Just my little plug. I stopped buying any more Baby Mozart, Baby Bach or Baby Beethoven & now give Classical Baby to my pregnant friends!

Although, when it's time to start teaching words & other ideas, I guess I'll have to go back to Baby Einstein - unless HBO comes up with some more in the series!",1133136000,34,894,4.285714285714286
2329409,5,B0009WPKYA,"Classical baby is a godsend.  Our 6 month old has been receiving a nightly dose of Classical Baby and/or Classical Baby 2 that we recorded on our DVR since she was 3 or 4 months old.

SHE LOVES IT! She gets so excited now that she kicks and squeals as soon as the baby crawls across the stage. I actually just came on line to see if HBO had released the DVD's so that I could order them for future baby showers.

We have tried many other DVD baby programs, but these are the ones that she absolutely loves.  I am not claiming that she is learning art or music from them, but I know she watches intently and calms down immediately.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1133049600,9,651,4.217741935483871
2329410,5,B0009WPKYA,"I first saw this on HBO when my son was about 2 months old. He was fascinated with the television so I thought this might be a good alternative to the Sopranos (ok - a little HBO humor - just kidding!). After seeing the drivel that Baby Einstein is putting out with their video tapings of toys and animals on stock footage moving to horrible music - HBO's ""Classical Baby"" was such a wonderful find!

At 4 months we took our son to a wedding where there was a string quartet that played numerous scores. The fascinating thing is that when they played works that were featured on ""Classical Baby"" he recognized them and squealed with delight! It was amazing! (Same thing happened when I put on Perez Prado - he recognized the ""Mamba"" piece and loved it). I love that these DVDs are not only classical works but jazz as well.

So at six months ""Classical Baby"" is part of his night-time wind-down routine. It just completely relaxes him. He gets to watch a little ""Classical Baby"" and then he knows its bath-time and then bed.

I think that the animations are wonderful, creative, and introduce masterworks in an appealing way. My husband and I even enjoy watching them. You cannot expect a baby to stare at a picture of Monet's ""Waterlilies"" and be fascinated - but put a little well-drawn Momma & baby frog swimming through it  - now you're on to something.

I can't wait to take him to the museum when he gets older to see what he recognizes!

I hope you enjoy these DVDs, too! They are worth every penny!",1132185600,5,1506,4.458181818181818
2329411,5,B0009WPKYA,"I bought this on a whim at Costco.  I needed something to occupy my 2 year old while I did her hair.  This 3 pack was far better than I expected it would be!  We like it even better than the Baby Einstein videos.  A nice feature is the menu selection (which Baby Einstein doesn't have) so we can just watch a couple of the songs each day while fixing her hair.  ALL of my kids actually enjoy watching this (my oldest is 11), although perhaps not as much as the 4 & 2 year old.

We like the dance and music shows best.  The art show puts animated characters into classical art, but often you don't look at the actual art very much.  For example, there are cute creatures in a tree, but then Van Gogh's Starry Night is flashed on the screen at the very end.  There are animated frogs that jump around in Monet's lilypad picture, but you mostly see the frogs, not the art.  That said, I realize this is for babies, not an intensive intro to art.  I think the kids will recognize the pictures later as ones they've seen before. The animations are cute, but not too cheesy as another reviewer thought.  Plus all of the dvds have good music (mostly classical) for each scene.

The kids go around the house humming classical music.  So if that's a bad thing, don't get these dvds.  Frankly, I think you could do a lot worse as far as kid's dvds go!

My one complaint is that the baby voice they have to announce each selection is often hard to understand.  My 2 year old repeats each one, but she usually says it wrong because the baby/toddler doesn't pronounce it very well.",1131667200,66,1568,4.261016949152542

2329413,5,B0009WPKYA,"One individual indicated that this DVD was ""atrocious"".  You have to remember that this DVD is geared for very young children.  My 10 month old calms down and is incredibly engaged with this DVD.  My three year old likes to watch it as well.  Young children need to experience music in this format.  They can't sit through an entire performance and are often not allowed in the symphony before age five.  This is a perfect introduction to music and can help children imagine and explore beyond the music.  Demonstrating the art and dance involves all the senses. These DVD's are very well done and the animation is very good. Again, the animation can't be overdone.  For a baby the animation must be slower and less defined or it would simply overwhelm. I find these delightful and calming to watch as well!  The bad reviewer also asserts that because the DVD's are entitled ""Classical Baby"" that individuals who purchase them know nothing about music.  Trust me, my husband and I know music!",1130889600,10,992,4.748538011695906
2329434,1,B0009WPKYA,"This is going to make me look like a snob, but I don't care.

I noticed this thing playing on TV about a month and a half ago, and decided to give it a whirl for the fun of it. What I saw was cheesy animation depicting bad performances of gutted versions of the repertoire's master works, defiling and trivialising the names of Bach, Bart&oacute;k, and others. ""Fantasia"" was bad enough, featuring horrendous, out-of-sequence, appallingly abbreviated performances of everything from Stravinsky to Tchaikovsky, but this really takes the cake.

If you twisted my arm, and if you paid me a huge wad of money, and if you threatened me with my life, I MIGHT use this as an introduction to the arts, and nothing more.

Avoid this. Also avoid, as a rule, any album starting with ""Baby Needs"" or ""Baby's First""; by buying them, you are only attempting to teach your children things you don't know anything about yourself.

It's very relaxing, and he loves to hum along with the music - he especially loves ""Baby's Hands"", and sits there and waves his hands...the only drawback like someone said earlier is that the Art, Dance and Music are rehashings of the original Classical Baby 1 & 2...other than that, it's great, and I'll definitely be ordering the DVD.",1129334400,2,628,4.413793103448276

I hit record on TiVo right away and we started to play it every morning.  She never watched at first although she definitely responded to the music.  Now, at 8 mos., she watches, gets excited, claps and laughs.  It provides her with her own ""alone time"".  She'll sit perfectly content in her exersaucer or on the ground playing while Classical Baby is on the tube.  I was so excited to find that HBO was selling these in a 3 disc set we pre-ordered it.  I love that it has ""pop-up notes"" so I can see who the artists, composers, musicians are.  I like to think she'll recognize these sights and sounds in the future.  We were weary about letting her watch TV before age 1 but Classical Baby isn't mindless junk.  I've even learned a thing or two and it's inspired me to go the art museum!

PLUS he's learned about opera and ballet, which is GREAT because now we listen to opera in the car and he enjoys it.  This is by far the least annoying of any other kid video or kid music (Because it's not Kid music), so I'm happy to put it on for my child.
