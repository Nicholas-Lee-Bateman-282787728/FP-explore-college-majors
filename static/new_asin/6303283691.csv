615993,2,6303283691,"*** This review contains spoilers ***

  The bulk of 'Belle Epoque' is supposed to be a pastoral romance, a farce of sorts despite being set during the heady eve of the Spanish Civil War in 1931. The film begins inappropriately with our protagonist, Fernando, an army deserter, having just been taken into custody by two officers of the Civil Guard who happen to be father and son-in-law. The father-in-law wants to let Fernando go but the son-in-law, a Nationalist, can't stomach the idea of allowing a 'traitor' to walk free so impulsively he shoots his father-in-law to death but realizing he'll have to face his wife later on and tell her that he's responsible for killing her father, ends up killing himself. Not a very good idea to start off with such an unpleasant scene when most of your story is supposed to be comic in tone.

  Fernando arrives in a village and seeks to patronize a prostitute at the local brothel. We find out the local priest has no guilt feelings about playing cards with his buddies inside the brothel. There, Fernando meets one of the priest's fellow card players, Manolo, a retired artist, who invites him to stay at his house. Like most people in the village, Manolo is decidedly pro-Republican and is thoroughly tolerant of alternative lifestyles. Fernando is about to return to Madrid but changes his mind when Manolo's four daughters arrive by train.

  Since this is a farce, we're supposed to suspend our disbelief when each of the four daughters falls for the rather passive Fernando with the libertine Manolo encouraging the randy Lothario as he beds each woman.

  One of the daughters, Violeta, is an independent woman who works as a veterinarian and also happens to be a lesbian. When the daughters dress Fernando up as a maid for a costume party at a local carnival, Violeta dresses herself up in Fernando's army uniform and then ends up having sex with him inside a barn at the carnival. In a scene more titillating than erotic, Fernando passively lies underneath in his maid's costume as Violeta makes love to him on top. The next day, Fernando informs Manolo of the encounter and he's overjoyed that his daughter now has shown an interest in men. Violeta squelches any possibilities that she has an interest in the opposite sex and makes it clear to her father that in effect the previous night's encounter was simply 'role-playing' and she really has no interest in Fernando.

  Despite her great attraction to Fernando, Rocio, another one of Manolo's daughters, has been involved with Juanito, a son of a wealthy Royalist widow, who has difficulty escaping the clutches of his control freak mother. There are some rather unfunny scenes with the mother going after Rocio and Juanito even goes so far as to demand that he be excommunicated from the church by the local priest in order to prove to Rocio he's no longer a mamma's boy. At the same time, Rocio strings Juanito along but eventually realizes that they were made for each other and end up marrying.

  Fernando also tries to prove his mettle with Clara, who lost her husband a year before in a drowning accident. The film's scenarists try to extract some humor in a reference to the deceased husband's last meal. Clara mentions that he loved rice and her sister states it was the only dish he knew how to cook. Clara then lamely replies, ""I know"". Clara becomes so confused over her feelings for Fernando, that she ends up pushing him into the river, in the same spot where her ex-husband drowned. Fernando contracts pneumonia and the daughters then have to attend to him to ensure that he recovers.

  The last daughter, Luz (played by Penelope Cruz), is perhaps the least interesting of the four daughters. She's simply childish and is jealous of her three sisters who have already become involved with Fernando. I'm not sure exactly why Fernando ends up with Luz (perhaps he feels sorry for her) but the young couple are seen leaving for America at film's end.

  In addition to the sour note of the murder/suicide at the start of the film, there's also another unsavory moment when the priest kills himself after he feels betrayed by his hero, poet/philosopher Miguel de Unamono, who for a short while supported Franco and the Nationalists.

  Belle Epoque fails not only for its two brief unnecessary forays into tragedy (the death of the Civil Guards and the Priest suicide) but because the principal characters are decidedly superficial and hence inconsequential. Violeta is basically mean-spirited (recall her unchivalrous tirade after Fernando informs her father of their fling); Rocio is a shallow coquette in regards to her relationship with Juanito, the foolish Clara is disconnected, unable to truly grieve over her lost husband and Luz is simply an immature adolescent. As for Fernando, his behavior with the four daughters speaks for itself!

  Only Manolo, the intuitive libertine, comes across as somewhat multi-dimensional character. He's seen as particularly likable when he's willing to accept his opera singer wife's manager who he's quite aware has been involved with her while they've been on tour. Manolo is also a philosopher--I particularly liked when he reads a sensual passage from the 'The Magic Mountain' and concludes with the line: ""What youth!"".

  As a point of comparison, there's a British/Irish film made in 2000 entitled 'About Adam' which has a very similar storyline to Belle Epoque. A young Lothario ingratiates his way into a household consisting mainly of women who have become besotted with him. Both are farcical in tone but 'Adam' manages to exude a slight bit more charm than the specious 'Epoque'.

  'Belle' is the perfect kind of mediocre film which you would expect would win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language feature. It was safe and offended no one which guaranteed all the awards and accolades it managed to garner.",1286668800,4,5878,4.890120967741935
615994,5,6303283691,"drama, mischief and a lucky man who walks in to a situation that some would say, ""I was just there at the right time and right place"" this adventure of is so incredibly cute funny and sexy,especially to those who have had something similar happen to them. When I was a young man in my teens I had this type of romance silly girls especially growing up in these Hispanic countries women seem to be more open. This movie was great for those that love romance and teenage love. The way the romance is brought on is quite subtle with flirting at every corner and picking up on vibes and attitudes, lol. I laugh cause one scene a girl is totally flirting and the guy goes for it so she plays hard to get and tells him to stay away, but then she pulls him back in and then pushes him away, lol! it is hilarious, because that's the most beautiful playful way romance is, women don't want to let themselves go, but at the same time they want a man to take them there, I won't spoil it for you all, but I do recommend it. It's in Spanish so if you don't speak it, you may lose a little of the meaning I know something is lost in translation when I watch French films, so I have made it my effort to learn French. I think If every man went through what this young lad went through then all men would be happy. I totally recommend it and pay attention to the body movement and the language of gestures and eyes, lol!",1274227200,3,1405,4.131386861313868

While there is some interesting commentary, this movie is more for enjoyment than serious thinking. As the main character has romantic encounters one after the other with four sisters of different personalities, you secretly hope he ends up with each of them in the end. The sisters and their father make up a very non-traditional family for the period, yet come acoss as being more well-balanced and likable than local teacher and his mother who are very traditional. Of course the backdrop of this movie is the republican period right before the Spanish civil war, so there are some issues pertaining to the church, government, and social structure, but the best part of the movie is the gorgeous look of the film and the romantic storyline.",1215475200,,839,4.833333333333333

As this young, confused man is jumping to bed with each one of them, hoping for love, it is less comical and more boring to observe a poor creature trapped in he house of women who is treated as a sex toy and yet gets lucky to marry the youngest one.

Still, it's a mostly lighthearted romp, and Trueba orchestrates the farcical aspects deftly, creating bold, well-developed characters and coaxing fine performances from his lead actors, particularly Penelope Cruz, still waiting to be discovered by Hollywood (and Tom Cruise) in 1994. The erotic shenanigans get an extra twist when Manolo's wife Amalia, a touring cabaret star played by peppy Mary Carmen Ramirez, shows up with her new lover.

The people are types, no one feels anything deeper than lust and sentimentality, and the  story isn't remotely believable.  Most objectionable, though, was the self-conscious ""cuteness"" to the point that I wanted the hero to be sent back to the seminary. I agree with another reviewer who wondered what anyone saw in him, other than his ability to cook.  In the opening scene, the young deserter's pants fall down when he's found by the guards.  This is supposed to be hilarious...and it goes downhill from there. It should have included a laugh track.

Set in the Spanish Civil War, a concsientious objector deserts the army and ups being offered refuge at the farm of a charming old intellectual, whose four daughters each end up taking a quick liking to the young - and perpetually flummoxed - desserter.  Filled with a large, great cast of diverse characters - including the farm father's eclectic group of friends and his unusual, absent-on-tour musician wife, and spearheaded by Penelope Cruz's smashing performance as Luz - ""Belle Epoque"" taps into a rich range of material and does it all extremely well.

616045,3,6303283691,"Let me start by saying I only watched this film because it features Penelope Cruz in one of her earliest roles.  I'm not a fan of non-horror European cinema, and maybe that's why my reaction to the film is significantly less enthusiastic than that of other reviewers.  I found Belle Epoque somewhat disturbing, actually.  Basically, this is the story of an army deserter who sleeps his way through an entire family of sisters - talk about your hand-me-downs - yet it turns out that his relationships aren't the weirdest ones on display.  I will say this: when you put a man in a dress and play out a really weird cross-dressing romantic encounter with him, you're going to lose this viewer to a significant degree.  This whole film is just really, really weird - almost deviant, even.

The story takes place in 1931 Spain, a country on the verge of discarding its monarchy and becoming a Republic.  The politics of the day and age play a definite part in the whole story, and I'm sure my less than spectacular knowledge of Spanish history was a bit of a handicap in terms of digesting everything I saw and heard, but this is really a film about people and not politics.  Fernando (Jorge Sanz) is a young deserter who finds shelter and friendship with an older gentleman named Manolo (Fernando Fernan Gomez) - until Manolo's four daughters arrive for an extended visit.  Rather than return to Madrid as planned, Fernando decides to hang around a while after getting a look at Clara (Miriam Diaz Aroca), Violeta (Ariadna Gil), Rocio (Maribel Verdu), and Luz (Penelope Cruz).  They apparently take a shine to him, as well, as the three oldest sisters manage to seduce him one after another, leaving young Luz increasingly jealous.  I certainly don't know what they see in the shiftless fellow; the only thing he has in terms of personality is a vague Robert Downey, Jr., aura about him (that's not a good thing, by the way).  He is much more appealing than Rocio's on-again, off-again fiancee Juanito (Gabino Diego), the film's most irritating character by far.

I personally found this whole story the very opposite of romantic.  The sexual encounters are all quick and clumsy, and the sisters have no problem sharing their experiences with one another.  It becomes a little easier to understand the sisters when their diva of a mother shows up for a visit, though.  At that point, the gang's all here - Fernando the cad, the four sisters, the father, the mother, and the mother's lover.  It's free love all over the place.  Fairly disgusted with the whole lot of them, all I could do was hope that Luz might not follow in the footsteps of her ribald sisters - even though it's hard to wish too many good thoughts for a girl more than willing to claim a man who already knows her three sisters quite intimately.

I guess some viewers can just take this film at face value and have fun with it, but I was really turned off by the morals of these characters - and I daresay that my fellow old-fashioned curmudgeons will share some of my own disquiet over the nature of the entire story.  If nothing else, I think it's safe to say that Belle Epoque clearly isn't for everyone.",1143676800,7,3171,4.628571428571429
616046,4,6303283691,"I read several of the other reviews and I had to add my 2 cents worth.  The movie is intertaining but pretty corny.  There is actually nothing in the plot that is believable or realistic. If you do not know something of the Spanish civil war, you will not understand some of the humor or dialog. As I watched the film, it reminded me of the humor of the three stoodges. Much of the humor is along those lines (corny) but of a sexual nature and irreverent nature (this in keeping with one of the main issues of the civil war).  If you are Catholic or somewhat prudish, you will not like this film at all.",1131926400,2,603,4.181034482758621

616130,5,6303283691,"Belle Epoque is a beautifully rendered film with a good sense of humor and a well-paced plot.  Unlike what a previous reviewer wrote, it is actually set in the years PRECEDING the Spanish Civil War, that is, when a republic was established after the abdication of Alfonso XIII in 1931.  The debate between Monarchism and Carlism versus Republicanism and Anarchism -a split in Spanish society that would culminate in the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936- is made accessible as expressed by the colorful characters in this movie: the pampered mollycoddle Juanito, the irreverent priest, the artist-patriarch (who nevertheless lives like a ""scared old bourgeois"").  The Civil War of the 1936-39 was only the last of the many civil wars that erupted in Spain during the modern era (e.g. the Carlist Wars of the Nineteenth Century). The movie will throw light on this turbulent time as it affected ordinary people, and for those of you not squeamish about the idea of a man sleeping with four beautiful women in the course of a few days, I recommend this movie highly.  ""Belle Epoque"" is NOT fluff or late-night soft porn; it is only disguising its gravity behind a faade of lightheartedness.",1057276800,48,1188,4.895522388059701

Each, in turn, seduce and confuse the poor boy.  This level alone is fun. However, the dialog between the two guards at the begining set the tone of social commentary.  If you know anything about the Spanish Civil War you will find that each of the daughters represent also the four main factions of the war.  Watch deeper and pay attention to the social and historical events that were taking place in the time setting of the movie, you will understand the film's muted anti-war commentary and why it won the '92 Oscar.  If you don't really care about all that bookish stuff it is still a funny and sexy film about finding the right girl.

616133,4,6303283691,"This movie is unequivocably recommended.  The themes are mature and the subtitles use the most common of language.  Fortunately the subtitles don't translate the most common of those words as often as they're said in this delightful Spanish farce.  The movie is meaningless, but very funny and very entertaining with lots to recommend it.
The movie has excellent character development, charming  and humorous dialogues, lovely cinematography and an overall attractiveness.
The male lead has led an innocent existence in which he spent some time in a seminary, and then has deserted from the army.  Now when he meets the four daughters of a libertine aging artist who has befriended him, he wants to make up for lost time.  The older three daughters use him for their forbidden pleasures, and don't take the encounters seriously.  Being unsophisticated, he falls in love with each until the next one seduces him.  He doesn't realize until almost too late, that the youngest actually loves him, although I can't see what qualities he has except for his looks.  Oh, that's right, he cooks better than anyone in the family.
The costume celebration and its aftermath is one of the most hilarious I've seen in a movie regardless of language.
I'm sure there were social messages that without knowledge of Spanish customs and history, were not apparent.  There seemed to be a strong association with death.  The side story of the young man who is infatuated with the second daughter but can't break away from his mother or tradition, until his frustration causes him to falsely renounce everything his mother stands for, probably symbolizes certain hypocrises in Spain at that point in history as it tried to break away from a moonarchy but couldn't make up its mind.

616196,4,6303283691,"This is a funny but not hilarious, sexy story that takes place in the countryside of Spain during the Civil War. It definitely has a French feel to the movie. The other reviews have pretty much covered this movie in detail so my purpose is more to agree with the overwhelming majority and not with the editorial writer. It is light and airy, like a beautiful cumulus cloud, a refreshing sight to behold and experience. Ominous dark clouds with heavy messaages are nowhere to be found, it's just a witty, sharp movie that entertains, a passive movie experience for that time when you want to just relax and not think too much. Well, maybe day dream about Penelope Cruz. There are the issues of religion, Franco and patriotism but it is not overwhelming, one is too distracted by the four women charcters in the movie, or if you're a female, the young handsome lead actor. For me there was one reason to see this movie, Penelope Cruz. She is pretty good in this movie. She was only eighteen at the time, so the role as the younger sister, Luz, is hardly a stretch. She has a certain quality to her, coquet all the while, her youthful naivete is engrossing and captivates the imagination. She plays her part with enthusiasm and even when she is not he main focal point of attention, her little nuances are fun to watch. The other women are very attractive too but Pe gets my vote. It's not that she is the prettiest either, it's the intangible, the realness in her portrayl, the beauty of her innocence. The sisters are all very good as well. An apparently gay sister, a widow and another who is being persued by a very funny moma's boy all make for good charcters for a funny movie. The mother and father of the sisters are well done and round out an excellent supporting cast. The plot is simple, a  young man must choose between four beautiful women. Life can be tough!! It is easy to see early on who will win out so that is not important, it is just the adventures in between. A good light hearted movie, nothing serious, just fun.",980640000,,2033,4.46505376344086

Four young women, daughters of Manolo, an  ageing Republican artist, played with warmth and a becoming rakishness by  Fernando Fernn Gmez, converge one at a time on our very lucky hero (Jorge  Sanz) so as to better help him decide which one he really loves.  Director  Fernando Trueba lets him try all four before a decision is reached.  The  sex scenes couldn't get by the Vatican, but are so charmingly done that we  are delighted.  None of your sick, violent Anglo matings here.  No rapes,  no drugs, no booze, just sweet country coupling all around.
The target  of the satire is mostly the Catholic church and the Fascists, but the  Republicans take some hits as well.  The war is entirely in the background  except for a little comdie noire scene at the outset where two stupido  Fascists soldiers do themselves in.  Our hero's foil is a Jerry Lewis sort  of mamma's boy romancing one of the daughters with his inheritance and his  mother.  He flip-flops between the church and the Republicans trying to  please mamma and Clara, his enchantress, second daughter of Manolo.  Manolo's foil is the parish priest, a hypocritical libertine, who commits  most of the deadly sins before expiring by his own hand when the  Republicans win (temporarily) the war.
The title (in English, ""The Age of  Beauty"") is ironic because of the war, but literal as it refers to the time  of our youth.  Is it not uplifting to recall our loves instead of our wars,  to turn our political and religious hatreds into benign satirical jokes,  and to see the beauty of our nature and not our bestiality?
The  traditional comedy of course ends in marriage, but to whom?  I'm betting  on the beautiful Penlope Cruz, who was just eighteen when this film was  released.",965260800,4,2069,4.69187675070028
616198,5,6303283691,"Belle Epoque reminds of a traditional French-style cinema, just like the title itself.
It is a story of basically decent, but very confused young man (incredibly cute one, too), whose only concern is how to survive amidst  the chaos of Spanish Civil War.
The film begins with this young man,  Fernando, almost being killed, but it ends with him being very much alive  and happy.  In the process, Fernando meets a lot of new people: an old man,  Manolo, and his unconventional family, to say the least. The relationship  between Manolo and Fernando takes a special place in the story, along with  Fernando's amorous interest in Manolo's daughter(s).
Apart from love and  youth, Belle Epoque is  also looking at Spain's historical background  and  hypocritical nature of society during the Great Spanish Civil War.
Overall, Belle Epoque is both visually appealing and very philosophical,  at the same time. It is a real masterpiece.",960422400,5,930,5.046052631578948
616199,5,6303283691,"I disagree with the Amazon editorial. Yes, this is a funny, sexy movie; maybe a young man's dream come true. It also has a lot of real commentary on Spanish society at the time; right before the Spanish Civil War. The  characters end the movie thinking all is well in the world and don't know  the Civil War is right around the corner. I am sure this aspect is lost on  most American audiences, but it is a very real part of the film and  juxtaposes the light, sexy, comic aspects of this movie. The scene where  the priest hangs himself in the church right before the young couple get  married is very symbolic of how the church felt at this time of  liberalization and the backlash that led to the Civil War (1930s).  See the  movie!  It is one of my all-time favorites.",952992000,39,772,4.298611111111111

Anyone who has been to Spain will see the character and spirit of the Spanish represented by the personalities of the four beautiful sisters,  their father, mother, and of course the deserter from the army.  The  opening scene with the two Civil Guardia definitely makes a statement about  the mind-set in Spain of 1931.  Trueba brings it all together to give us  this wonderfully humorous, sexy, interesting, and altogether pleasing film.  Muchas gracias Fernando!
