Make it $6.00 for a 24 hour rental and $9.95 to $15.00 for purchases of the video. To the writer. You may think this video is worth more, but play the numbers. At $40.00 there will be a lot fewer purchases compared to a lower price of $9.95. You make more money, Amazon makes more money. It is a true win-win for all parties with this video.",1378425600,,478,4.042105263157895

Okay, I'm being silly. But you know, I did the program and I still get pissed at so many things.

Such as: why people who seem to have everything still drive around in their mercedes with road rage. It's like get a grip, people.  When will YOU be happy?

Such as: Litter and corporations who don't give a ding dang damn about me or you or any of the kids that are being left behind to clean up the mess of polution and waste this world is leaving them.

And while that gets me mad I'd have to say that I really signed up for anger management to deal with people who hate dogs and put poison on their lawns to kill dogs who pee on grass.

Like humans don't have enough and aren't destroying enough beauty on this planet that they now can't even show tolerance to a four legged animal that mostly just wants to lick you and wag their tail and beg.

And of course I'd say that voice mails that cut me off in the middle of leaving a message send me over the edge.  Well, as much as I'd like to say the DVD helped me -

I have to admit that I am still pissed!

Love and PEACE out.

Oh, the only solution I have found that helps me with my rageful interior is to be of service, get out of my own selfish B.S, and go help someone else.  That being said I am working with uploadsforpeace.org where I - the anger queen and actually trying to
create world peace!  What an oxi-moron!",1331769600,,1516,4.030100334448161

I feel his techniques really works and that he talks about anger in a very clear and concise manner.

The hypnosis part is excellent - however, I had a bad DVD and it actually died right when he went into the second hypnosis session- but I DIDN'T get ANGRY!  :)

I actually thought it was funny and laughed about it. Amazon is sending me a new one right away. Perhaps the first hypnosis session has already had an effective impact on me.

I recommend as Richard does on this DVD, that you listen to the hypnosis section every day for thirty days - At the end of 30 days I can already see how much of a powerful impact this DVD will have on anyone with anger issues.  Richard is basically resetting the triggers in our body that send off that angry - impulsive message that makes our blood boil. By doing the hypnosis on this DVD every day for 30 days, your mind will start to reboot like a computer and react to situations that used to set us off in a more healthy, positive and relaxed way.

Thanks for making this!  Let's do one together next time - with superb sound!

On a side note: I have written a children's book with my son called THE ADVENTURES OF SUPER CELLULAR - It's a GET WELL SOON BOOK for sick children. I hope you will check it out, buy a book and send it to a local hospital for children -50% percent of the profits on THE ADVENTURES OF SUPER CELLULAR go to the City Of Hope Hospital.

God bless and take care!",1256601600,,1675,4.238993710691824
