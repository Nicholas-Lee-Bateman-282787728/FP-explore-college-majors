180436,5,094198107X,"I have been waiting for the release of this film since I heard about it a year ago. This movie is about the struggle of a lost man with a dark past. His daring struggles to regain status in society, and the sacrifices he has  to make to get where he wants to be.  Set In urban California,  the director does a great job of foreshadowing. The movie helps us all to  realize that pain can run deeper than we believe it to be. I enjoyed this  movie because it is extremely well done and the point is well recieved.  Although this movie is sad it hits a chord that sometimes is a little  too close to home.",943833600,4,602,4.0508474576271185
180437,5,094198107X,This is gonna be the best movie...Darren Doane is by far the best director of music videos and now movies ever! Can't wait till i get it to give a complete review of it...,942883200,,171,4.0588235294117645
7795963,5,094198107X,"First off, I want to say this is one of the most POWERFUL films I have ever seen.  Darren Doane was on a budget and really impressed me with this movie.  It's Apocalypse Now for the suburban teenagers.  The movie is hardcore and the sound track is amazing (With bands like Blink 182, Pennywise, Downer, MXPX, Stavesacre, Rollins Band, Descendents, Guttermouth, Ten Foot Pole, Strife, AFI and Far).  Godmoney is a story of urban survival.  It is set in Los Angeles, and it is about a guy named Nathan who leaves New York and tries to forgive his past of crime, drug addiction and life on the streets (And what an intense past he's had, you aren't told about his past until further into this movie).  Once in California he tries to put his life together, but is befriended by Matthew, a small-time dealer who recruits Nathan to work for him.  Nathan's life is turned upside down when Matthew offers him twenty thousand dollars to kill a rival dealer.  Nathan must decide if everyone, including himself, has a price.  Godmoney is the highly anticipated release of Doane's first feature film.  I feel Godmoney makes Underground Independent Filmmaking all the better and more enjoyable to watch then your mainstream MGM releases.  The DVD also offers these special features which I really enjoyed watching :

* Audio Commentary by Director Darren Doane

* ""Spoof"" Commentary by Darren Doane and Producer Ken Daurio

* Three Deleted Scenes

* Four Music Videos

* Original ""Making Of"" Featurette

* Gag Reel

* Location Walk-Through with Darren Doane

* 30-Second TV Commercial Spot

* First 12 Minutes of Original Godmoney Filming Attempt

* Theatrical Trailer

This is a suburb movie!  Powerful and I promise you will be glued to your TV with this movie.  Watch and enjoy!  If your looking for a high budget movie that has big actors and actresses in it look elsewhere.  But if your looking for a movie like 'Kids (Larry Clark), Elephant (Gus Van Sant), Julien Donkey Boy (Harmony Korine), Bully (Larry Clark), Scarlet Diva (Asia Argento), Clean Shaven (Lodge Kerrigan), Requiem For A Dream (Darren Aronofsky), Baise-Moi (Coralie Birginie Despentes), Irreversible (Gaspar Noe), Spun (Jonas Akerlund), I Stand Alone (Gaspar Noe), Funny Games (Michael Haneke), Gummo (Harmony Korine) then this movie will be right up your alley!  Oh and by the way, if you haven't seen all those other movies I just mentioned, you owe it to yourself to see 'ALL' of them.  Great movies that have all gone under the radars of most people.  I Highly recommend All of them, if your looking for movies that are jawdropping with intense moments, look no further (Look at some of my other Reviews and Listmania's).  I've seen alot of movies and those are all in the top 100 for Me.",1128211200,,2752,4.8059701492537314
7795964,4,094198107X,"I rented this not long after it came out at Hollywood Video and I was pretty impressed with what I saw. I've rented several times since then and I just now finally bought it on DVD and I'm very happy I did. The storyline of the film isn't original by any means, but it draws you in nonetheless. The acting is suprisingly good, considering that several of the actors are actually rockers, (lead character-Rick Rodney, singer for Strife; Fletcher-guitarist for Pennywise; Warren-guitarist for the Vandals; and a few others who make some quick appearances). The film's camera work, music, and sound are also noteworthy.
I also enjoyed all the special features the DVD version had to offer. Some of the features weren't that entertaining but there are definitely some interesting highlights such as a 12 min. clip from the original Godmoney filming attempt, which, essentially, follows the same story but has completely different actors-it's interesting to watch the movie first then watch this feature; it's more weird than anything. There are also a few music videos by artists who contributed to the soundtrack, deleted scenes, and an interview with the director Darren Doane. I could see how some people wouldn't like this film for it not being flashy enough, but you have to keep in mind that this film was released in 1997 on a very small budget. Circumstances given, I think they did a killer job on this project. The only reason I don't give this film five stars is due to it's lack of character development. You find out just enough about each character to satisfy their roles in the film, but a few things get left unexplained leaving you curious about some of their origins. Overall I strongly recommend this release. It's got it's flaws, but it presents more than enough to merit a viewing.
(there's also a nice fight scene with a mean curbjob, a good two years before American History X made that their shocker scene)",1053820800,,1926,4.8217522658610275
7795965,1,094198107X,this was the worst movie i have ever seen (and i have some pretty low standards).  the acting was completely over done and the story line was followed so pitifully that i want to shoot myself thinking that i spent two hours working just to waste the money on this piece of [...]!  i am now selling it on (the resale market)with a disclaimer that even though the movie packaging is in great condition i don't vouch for the actual movie being remembered as a good purchase for anyone.,1007856000,,482,4.404494382022472
7795966,4,094198107X,"I did like this film, but for all the wrong reasons.  I am not familiar with any of the soundtrack artists (except for Blink 182, and they are getting a little old), I wanted to see it because of the story.  The story, it turns out, has been done before.  You can get caught up following the life of a guy who must turn to drug dealing to survive, and the surprise ending and acting really worked.  The direction was too MTV-ish, and I slowly realized that we are supposed to be cheering on a drug dealing murderer...what ever happened to heroic characters?  Good elements, but no five stars.",981849600,2,592,4.394495412844036
7795967,5,094198107X,"So far, I have seen mixed reviews about this movie.  What it boils down to is that many viewers feel GODMONEY rips off American History X.  However, this is not the case.  Godmoney was made a year and a half before AHX.  However, both movies, when stripped down, have alot in common. Godmoney is about a young man named Nathan (Ric Rodney of straightedge punk band STRIFE)who is searching for his identity.  We learn about his past via black and white flashback techniques throughout the movie.  The search for identity also leads Nathan to confront what is ""morally"" right.  This is signified by the symbols of religion (churches, cross [or lack of in some cases!]).  There is a significant use of symbolism with in this movie, so look out for them! I'm not trying to give away too much to the movie, so will just say, if you liked American History X, this movie is deffinitely for you.  In fact, this movie is more ""raw"" than AHX, which gives it more credibility in my eye's.  AHX is sugar coated to attract more ""mainstream"" theatre viewers.  Whereas, Godmoney sticks to it's guns and delivers the goods, with out selling out.  If anything, Tony Kaye, aka ""humpty dumpty"", should take directing lessons from newcomer Darren Doane.  Doane created a more powerful movie than Kaye with lesser named actors (Rodney vs. Ed. Norton, which have you heard before?  Who would win in a fight? My money is on Rodney because he is no ""Brad Pitt ala FIGHT CLUB"").  However, just like the great Aristotle said, it is the plot, not the actor, who makes the play (movie in this case).  The plot, in effect, is what makes the actor a ""star"".  So give Rodney and company their due, or give Doane more than a $200,000 budget, so he can showcase his talent.",981331200,,1740,4.5792880258899675
7795968,3,094198107X,"I'm a huge fan of STRIFE (or was before they broke up - I'm not a big fan of angermeans). I was psyched to see a film that Rick Rodney did. I almost didn't recognize him with his hair grown out. Anyhow, I think the film overall is pretty good, though I don't think it carries the impact that I was hoping for. In my opinion the plot was a little underdeveloped and some of the flashback sequences were too blatantly symbolic and overused. I like the idea of the story and Rick Rodney does a great job playing the part of Nathan; it's very believable. The part of Matthew, played by Bobby Field, however, isn't very believable and is somewhat annoying.
The music is great and it fits well with the sequences it is accompanied with. I'm not sure it's the ""Apocalypse now for suburban teenagers"" as the cover claims because it really didn't bring to light everything a kid in suburbia has to deal with. It touched on most of the issues, but it focused heavily on drugs and violence.
I think it was worth the money I spent to buy it, though the DVD extra features seem like they were slapped together at the last minute. Overall, it's worth buying and it's definitely worth watching at least once.",978307200,,1193,4.402714932126697
7795969,5,094198107X,"Ever since this movie came out I was like I need to see it. I had the great chance to see it I rented it out in Reading, Pa. Its amazing. Every second was fantastic. I have been seeking to find this movie I was going to steel it from the Video store its so impossible to find. My search has ended im buying it finally. You will want to watch this movie over and over again. There is alot of symbolysm. Its the greatest film Ive seen yet. Beats all that other mainstream stuff, Im glad that its hard to find.",970617600,,507,3.980392156862745
7795970,5,094198107X,"I just got done watching Godmoney, which I rented. And it is awesome. One thing that is really great, you as the viewer really get to know the lead charcter played by Rick Rodney, who did a awesome job. Rick Rodney is even  really a actor, he is in hardcore band, as a previous reviewer already  mentioned, but he puts on such a great performance you can't even tell.  This one of those few good movies that I'm actually planing on buying.  Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack, I'm a huge fan of  Strife and Stavsacre and that's just mentioning a few of the bands on the  soundtrack. If you havn't seen this movie see it, it's way better than all  those stupid mainstream movies.",963187200,2,698,4.40625
7795971,5,094198107X,"I saw the DVD version of the film, and it blew my mind away! This is the BEST independent film I have ever seen!  And I'm an independent filmmaker!  The DVD is PACKED with so much that I almost couoldn't watch it all at  once.  If you don't have a DVD player, I suggest that you buy one just to  watch this film!  It truly is a masterpiece!",961459200,,340,3.926470588235294
7795972,4,094198107X,"First off, I am reviewing a movie that I have actually SEEN (unlike a certain few before me). This film is starring Rick Rodney, which you may or may not know as the singer of the Hardcore Punk ""Strife"" (on  Victory Records)! This was his first film and did a satisfactory job as an  actor. It is the story of one man's struggle to escape his life of crime in  the East by living in California suburbia. Frequently out of work, he finds  himself creeping back into the life style he tried so hard to stay clean  of.

I actually ordered this movie before having heard anything about  it (based on its soundtrack and director). I was very pleased with the  outcome. While the plot/script was not genuinely unique, it was dealt with  in an interesting style (especially the ending).

It seems that this  movie was a possible inspiration for an even better flick called ""SLC  Punk"" (starring Matthew Lillard), another independent film that came  out a couple years later. The two films differ in plot but have much of the  same basis, and even similar scenes. Both movies have excellent directors  and are worth seeing.

As for the DVD features, this includes music  videos from Strife, MxPx, The Descendents and more. There is also unused  footage, and a joke reel (which really isn't that humorous). I still  recommend this title in DVD format. The movie is great, a rental might be  more appropriate before the purchase.",961027200,7,1419,4.668016194331984
