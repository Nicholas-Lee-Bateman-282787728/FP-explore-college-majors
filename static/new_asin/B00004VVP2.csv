1357940,3,B00004VVP2,this movie has some exposed body parts on it that i didn't like and it showed alot of intimate scenes which i think they should of left out. Me being a christian don't think that it is good to see some of the scenes like that on there. warning all christians that this movie is okay but not good for the kids to watch.,1169337600,12,318,3.984375
1357941,5,B00004VVP2,"The interesting biography which narrates the Rise and Fall of this wise man, first against the will of Adonias, and then against the divine designs and emblematized under the law are shown with admirable and well carried rhythm. His doubts, his disillusion when the designs obligate him to abandon his loved wife: Sheba Queen, his astonishing and proverbial domain of the human nature, find in this picture a deserved place in your library.

Max von Sydow, Anouk Aime, David Suchet, Ben Cross (as Salomon) Maria Grazia Cuccinota conform a stellar cast keeping in mind this is not a gigantic super production, because the main emphasis is to unveil the man behind the power and the glory. Consider it a beauty and striking chamber work, that reveals the Moral, Religious and Legal codes that preserved, supported and even delineated the Jewish community 's destiny in those times.",1135555200,,879,5.02054794520548
1357942,5,B00004VVP2,"I was quite amazed at the quality of the acting and directing of the these movies. Although quite a portion of the movies have been dramatized and at times exaggerated, the actors had done a wonderful job in bringing the stories to life. Also, execellent combination of the scences and music complement. The Solomon temple was presented with an accurate duplcation of what was described in the Bible.

Highly recommended.",1121558400,8,421,5.014285714285714
1357943,5,B00004VVP2,"A romanticized but quite accurate account of what is written in I Kings and II Chronicles, this made-for-television film is exceptional and boasts a brilliant international cast and fabulous settings.
Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, the landscapes are wonderful, and the buildings and set decoration, in warm amber shades, are a visual delight, enhanced by the cinematography of Raffaele Mertes. The terrific score by Patrick Williams also adds much to the atmosphere.
The section devoted to the Queen of Sheba has been embelished, but Viveca A. Fox is ravishing as the queen, and it makes for great drama.
The emphasis on this part is to show Solomon's destructive tendencies; women were his weakness, and the rationalizations for his behavior his undoing. From Adam to modern history, it's a common story, but in the case of Solomon, what he gave up for his weakness was God's mighty blessing, and the inheritance he would leave his heirs.
Ben Cross (""Chariots of Fire"") as this complex character is marvelous, and he is surrounded by a superb supporting cast. Though it's hard to take the nordic air from Max von Sydow (who in 1965 played Jesus in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""), he is nevertheless an aging giant of a man as King David, and France's great Anouk Aimee plays Solomon's mother Bathsheba with vigor, as she holds on to the reins of power with tenacity.
Other notable performances come from David Suchet (who was so good in the 1998 ""The Perfect Murder"") as Joab, Ivan Kaye as Solomon's half-brother Adonijah, and Richard Dillane as the laborer who ultimately rules ten of the twelve tribes, Jeroboam. Even the smallest parts are believable, which reflects on the excellent direction by Roger Young.
This is a Bible epic well worth owning for repeated viewing; some of it is poetic, some of it action-packed, often inspiring and thought provoking, and always fascinating.",1071964800,62,1887,5.012738853503185
1357944,4,B00004VVP2,"This is another of the Bible series from Trimark Home Video.  This one precedes ""Jeremiah"" and ""Esther.""  King David's naming Solomon his successor, as well as David's death, begins the film, while the death of Solomon and succession of Rehoboam finishes.
The focus of the film is more on the human part of the Bible rather than divinity.  God is present, but the producers are showing us how we allow our human nature to stray from Him.  At first, this was a little off-putting.  It seemed the film was more concerned with political intrigue and lust.  In retrospect, I see that we are to learn something about our own nature.
I would recommend this movie.",1020384000,8,657,4.6695652173913045
1357945,5,B00004VVP2,"This movie is very similar in style to King David. In fact, it would make a lot of sense to watch them in order.
I might be mistaken but the prophet Nathan looked like the same actor in both movies. Nathan took the place of Samuel after his death. Samuel means named of God. Samuel was the high priest, judge and prophet of Israel who annointed Saul and King David. (See 1 Kings 15,16)
I've also seen the movie Jeremiah and it too is a wonderful movie to include to your archives. The books of Jeremiah and Lamentations come to life as Israel is carried away captive into Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. (See Daniel 1)
I have read these books from the holy bible many times but these movies do further justice into bringing to life the vision and word of God to futher our understanding of the creator of heaven and earth into our memory.
I too reccommend the movie Joseph starring Ben Kingsley and the movie In the Beginning starring Martin Landau as Abraham.

1357946,4,B00004VVP2,"I just recently purchased this movie from Amazon.com, and they flashed up a message that the NTSC format may not be playable in Australia. Well, it is playable! All modern VCR's sold in Australia can play (and some can record) NTSC tapes. I have found this very useful as 'Solomon' and the other movies in this series have never been released in Australia.
'Solomon' is a solid, well acted drama (what do you expect, with Ben Cross taking the leading part). I found the first part of the movie quite entertaining, with plenty of action, as old King David's reign comes to an end and two brothers compete for the throne.
With the sequences dealing with the building of the Temple, I felt that little respect was paid to the holiness of the dwelling place of God, or of the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon treated the Holy of Holies with triviality. The inside of the temple walls were covered with gold, so the makers of the set should have paid more attention to detail.
Overall, the movie is well done, with a bit of laid back humour, especially when Solomon greets all his children after a hard day at the 'office'. If you like Biblical dramas, this is worth getting, provided you allow for a bit of 'licence'.",1000166400,13,1209,4.525114155251141
1357947,5,B00004VVP2,"If you've seen the Turner Network Television series of Biblical movies (like David, Moses, Abraham, etc.), this movie is made by the same people. In fact, some of the same actors are here. It's got a lot more action and drama than some of the other Biblical movies I've seen.
The story covers the period of Solomon's fight with Adonijah through to the split of the kingdom between Jeroboam and Rehoboam. Overall, it is quite faithful to the Scriptures except for the Queen of Sheba. In this movie, she becomes his wife. In any case, the movie does a terrific job showing Solomon's faithfulness transitioning to his turning away from God.
The producers also take some license in small areas where they integrate concepts from Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes into the movie. However, the point they're trying to highlight in those scenes comes through quite clear (and accurately). If you're like me, someone who doesn't like a lot of license in dealing with Scriptural truth, you will be able to enjoy the movie without a lot of distractions from the non-Scriptural parts.
This movie isn't for small children due to some violence in it. It's PG-13, in my opinion.",973555200,55,1161,4.81
1357948,4,B00004VVP2,"Ben Cross plays a wonderful and powerful part as ""Solomon"" which you will find it all, rebellion, corruption, courage, and faith. Like his father ""King David"" he got off to a good start but like his father he had a weakness for women that undid him,this in turn, led him away from ""God"". ""Solomon's"" beginning was better than his ending he had been raised to greatness, but plunged into the abyss of moral degradation and idolatry. I found that the love affair with ""Qween Sheba"" was not in accordance with scripture. The biblical text account of Sheba's visit was apparently a trade mission and to test Solomon's wisdom. All in all it is rich in history, drama, suffering, and death, and sets the stage for the rest of the Old Testament. It is well worth watching, I found it riviting and so sad at the same time.",970272000,12,814,4.54421768707483

1358332,3,B00004VVP2,"Okay, since even Christian and Jewish Bible scholars NEVER get the facts straight, the movie's many inaccuracies can be forgiven.  Of course, when God tells a story (or if you don't believe in God, consider it just a fairy tale) -- you are expected to draw conclusions about what is not said, from what IS said.  All good literature requires the reader's mind interact with the text, and Bible is no exception.

So what's great about this movie, besides the acting, is that the makers are trying to fill in what's not said in 1Kings Chapter 1-5, where the first part of the movie is told.  Yes, Adonijah (=""My Lord is God"") rebels.  It's a seven-year hiatus, with 1Chronicles 22-end explaining why:  David was not exactly gung ho to appoint Solomon, arguing the latter was 'young and inexperienced', during David's seven years of retirement when he designed all the Temple stuff and the priestly courses, service, etc. at God's bidding.  David is between age 70-77 when this happens, dying at age 77.  This latter fact, the scholars never get right, because they don't READ 1 Kings 1-5 to understand the clear chronology.  They read Josephus instead, who was seemingly unable to get even one date right!  So of course the 'contradiction' isn't blamed on the errant Josephus, but on Bible. What is a movie producer, to do?

So the movie doesn't cover David's age, nor does it resolve the scholar errors in the Temple building chronology (for they misread Bible there, too).  Yet in Bible's timeline, David's age is critical to the whole: for the DEADLINE OF THE WORLD'S TIME, established in Moses' Psalm 90 chronology meter (in Hebrew, can't see it in English), was for Messiah to die 1000 years after David dies, and the outer limit of that time is traced by EVERY Bible book writer ANNUALLY.  Every Bible date 'hubs' to it;  because, the 'Jubilee' of the Millennium (Psalm 90:4) was SCHEDULED to begin 57 years after Messiah's death (sum of Passover and Pentecost in the Mosaic law was the reminder of that).  So once you know that, ALL the Bible's dates not only become clear, but you can prove them historically.  Since scholars make this 7 year mistake on David, therefore, all Bible dates 'seem' problemmatic, and have been debated, for centuries.  But it's the scholars who are wrong.  So it took me 10 whopping years to plot Genesis through Revelation dates to show what BIBLE says;  so anyone can vet Bible accuracy WITHIN Bible.  The numbers all balance perfectly, much as your bank balance must when you properly account all your transactions.  Thus you know you've got a right BIBLE interpretation.  (You can find that demonstration of Bible material balancing the dates, under 'brainout' in vimeo, or 'brainouty' in Youtube.)  For Israel was ordered to COUNTDOWN TO MESSIAH beginning in Genesis 5, which is why Bible seems so boring.  Why, people make movies, to work out what they don't understand.  As, here.

Seems the movie tries to rectify the 1Kings scholar error, in the long speech repeated from 1Kings 1 between Max Von Sydow (playing David) and Ben Cross (playing Solomon), about 40 minutes into the movie (which is playing on my TV while I write this review).  That's laudable.  It tries to flesh out the hot political story of Solomon and his rivals.

So a major flaw in the movie, is that SOLOMON HAD ALREADY BEEN CROWNED KING THE FIRST TIME but then David's support waned, so he got sick (as God commanded Solomon be enthroned, but David's bucking God); and thus Adonijah, started to gain support.  The crowning at Gihon is the SECOND crowning of Solomon, per Bible (ibid).  Else, the movie valiantly tries to interpret 1Kings 1-5, with great acting by all.

However, after Solomon's second crowning, the movie increasingly departs from Scripture (i.e., alleging Nathan didn't marry, when BIBLE clearly states that Joseph and Mary descended from Nathan, for God promised they would NOT descend from Jeconiah son of Solomon), and (beginning two hours into the movie), goes instead to the many gossip books written about Solomon's alleged relationship with Sheba. Bible proves those gossips wrong, in the books Solomon wrote.  He wrote Song of Solomon about a common Shulamite woman, who he loved and lost; that book parallels world history, hence is a parallel spiritual lesson (i.e., God is your true love, don't 'marry' so many others and miss Him).

Duh: no Queen would ever have a son out of wedlock and then go home.  In fact, scholars for the longest time couldn't even prove there WAS a Land of Sheba.  I forget when, but I think it was during the 19th or early 20th century that they finally found archeological evidence of that kingdom?

Point is, from the Sheba story onward, the movie's all gossip.  Hence 3 stars, not five, because when someone claims to tell a BIBLE story, then the BIBLE ought to be consulted, not gossip.  Whether you believe the Bible is good or right or not, if you claim to talk ABOUT it, then READ it, k?  If I was making claims about YOU, whether you were good or not, shouldn't I consult YOU?  See: basic common sense and morality is violated if I go to gossips but NOT to you, and then claim what THEY say true, but what YOU say is ignored...

Of course, no movie or documentary of the Bible ever made, but consults gossip, contradicting Bible with no compunction or morality, whether made by Christians, Jews, or anyone else.  Oh well.  Better to try and fail, than not to try?

And yeah, the acting is wonderful, which is not normal for Bible movies.",1419724800,,5516,4.753943217665615

1358390,3,B00004VVP2,"King Solomon led a grand life, thus rating this epic movie entitled,Solomon. The first part spends the first hour tracing the rivalry of Solomon with half-brother Adonijah, before and after the death of their father King David. It then makes a 10-year leap to dramatize his famous method of divining the true mother of a contested infant. Then in the second part, the filmmakers embrace the legend that Solomon and the Queen of Sheba had a romantic as well as political alliance, suggesting that they were the star-crossed loves of each other's life and introducing some soft-focus nudity. With the queen's departure, Solomon descends into materialism and idolatry.

The performances are strong and the script artfully weaves in background information to give the viewer helpful historical context. Also,it makes the viewer realize the spiritual failures of King Solomon with his sins of idolatry,pride,arrogance and being a womanizer. Unfortunately,it fails to bring to a point that he happens to be the wisest man who lived on earth. And that what makes this adaptation lacking. It instead focused on Solomon's sins rather than his wisdom.",1415750400,,1141,5.2349726775956285

The narrative begins in the final days of king David and ends with the prophecy of the division of Solomon's kingdom - right after his death Some modification and adaptation of the book were made, I presume, with the intent of making it more attractive to the general audience. Nonetheless, when that happens, it always water down the Divinely inspired message.

Then at some point, Solomon fell away from his hebrew ways due to the persuasion of his many non-hebrew wives. In the movie, it's Queen of Sheba who marries Solomon and her ways intrigue Solomon and this draws him away. I'm not an old testament scholar so I could be missing other insightful info elsewhere. I was left to think the movie is not according to the scripture. However the movie was well done and it cast light on what Solomon's personality could be like so the scriptures made more sense to me.

Admittedly some of the fillers bear scrutiny as the Bible never gives us a clear picture of the relationship between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.  But it's more than entertaining.  It engages the mind with a workable progression of events that may very well have led to Solomon's break with God in his old age.  Watch it.  I think you'll like it.,1393804800,,414,4.466666666666667

Jesus of Nazereth was the best all around depiction of Jesus with great actors and directing. This movie is really close to the same and I enjoyed it. Ben Cross plays Solomon who took the throne after his father King David passed. He played his part well.

The Tanach / Old Testament say nothing about the extra-Biblical encounters between she and Solomon / the love story this movie has going on.

Besides the erection of a magnificent temple he succeeded in emulating the great kings of Western Asia and Egypt by building for himself in the city of Jerusalem, palaces, houses, and gardens....On his accession to the throne, it is related that Jehovah appeared to him at Gibeon in a dream...the young king, instead of asking for long life or riches or success in war, prayed to be endowed with an understanding heart that he might judge the people committed to him. His request was granted; ;and riches and honour were added thereto, with a promise of length of days if he kept Jehovah's commandments. In consequence of this endowment, he was reputed to be wiser than all men....He was at once a philosopher and a poet. He spake 3000 proverbs; his songs were 1005; and his utterances embraced references alike to the vegetable and the animal kingdoms....To his oppressive exactions, in furtherance of his schemes of luxury and magnificence, was due the discontent which in the reign of his son broke his kingdom in two, and ultimately led to the destruction in detail of the Hebrew nation by the power of Assyria and Babylon.

1358601,3,B00004VVP2,I have watched the movie Solomon several times. Some of the Biblical facts follow the Bible. One thing has always bothered me about the movie. The segment regarding Queen Sheba. I have researched my scriptures and I find nothing either in the Book of Kings or Chronicles that gives truth to the interpretation of the story in the movie. Queen Sheba came to Solomon to question his great knowledge. She brought gifts and observed all he did with his people. Solomon in turn gave gifts to the Queen and she returned to her own land. There is no love affair or marriage or child mentioned in the scriptures between Solomon and Queen Sheba. She is not mentioned in the Bible as one of Solomons wives nor is a child mentioned. The events of Queen Sheba and Solomon are pure fantacy on the part of the writer and film producer. That is why I am giving this movie a 3 star rating. Because the other facts about King Solomon reign folow scripture.,1361577600,,939,4.497076023391813

King Solomon's life is recorded (in the Bible) in the book of ""1 Kings"",chapters 1 through 11 and this movie followed REALLY well with scriptures from chapter to chapter.  I really liked that much of Solomon's conversation with his friend, Jeroboam, and teachings to the people were actually verses from Ecclesiastes and Proverbs.

1358659,4,B00004VVP2,"Well, okay, I've read the Biblical account of king Solomon, but, it was years ago. I recently ordered this ""SOLOMON"" Movie, and just now watched it all the way through. NOW, I want to re-read the Biblical Account of Solomon (""Shlomo"" in Hebrew) and re-count how his story really played out and how the Movie compares to the Truth. So, I'm creating this review BEFORE reading the Bible's Account (again). Also, let me say that I have the Movies of this same Bible Collection Series of ""ABRAHAM"", ""JOSEPH"", ""MOSES"", ""SAMSON AND DELILAH"", ""JESUS"" and now ""SOLOMON"", and of what I have thus far, I think they are excellent and very well done Movies. The acting in all of these Movies is high quality. I know I sound like I'm being ""diplomatic"" but, I truly mean it. I can see that trillion$ was not spent on these movies. But, they were not at all ""cheaply"" done either. Not at all. I mean, we have to remember, these were BIBLE DAYS not modern 20th and 21st centuries! I highly recommend these Movies for any serious follower of GOD, Christian or Messianic. I would say, PLEASE, know your Bible FIRST beforehand, so that you can know at which places Hollywood errs. but, other than that, they are GOOD and high-quality Entertainment. I think Ben Cross did very well as king Solomon. He put human emotion and feeling into it, especially for a guy. It was creepy when he got old and had departed from GOD, he seemed as if he'd gone feeble or a bit insane, which is what one CAN expect when separating themselves from GOD. The only other caution I have about the Movies is, as another reviewer noted, with the Movies of ""JOSEPH"" and ""SAMSON AND DELILAH"", where there is sexual intimacy expressed. They don't actually show anything, but, the implication is fairly strong. But, it shows what really could have happened. It wasn't the days of the Puritans. Again, they are great Movies for watching. At this time, I gave the SOLOMON Movie 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't re-read the Bible's Account recently. If I find it to be fairly close to the Bible's Account, I'll give it 5 stars. Also, btw, amazon.com
 has good service, and speedy delivery. Fast enough to make your head spin. Now, to read the Story of king Solomon in the Bible again!",1316649600,,2241,4.574626865671642
1358660,4,B00004VVP2,"This was a very geniune and sincere portrait of human tendencies and propenseties. The bible clearly states that this (Old testament) things where writing for our own abmonition. The word abmonition means a soft and gentle but still reprove. This story conveys the great potential that man has, to do both good and bad and this is what we fear most is our own greatness and darkness, this was conveyed to a ""T"" which is to suiT and fiT(please don't misconstrued,I don't want top stir the masses of the religious and i'm not trying to make light of sin).I've have seen many of this wonderful Bible Collection from this Turner production and have been well pleased with their Biblical accounts and sense of direction along with production but this one is as sincere and genuine as it gets with conveying the great capabilites and calamities of humanity. Also it depicted well how the pleasures of sin are but for a season which is but for a window of time and once crossing that threshold that pleasure turns sour on us. It's also our own nature tendecy to question the things of life and although Solomon did draw up some of the most pessimistc and negative conclusions (which is to lean  to our own human reasoning) he then close the books of Ecclesiastes with ""The whole duty of man is to fear the Lord and keep his commandmnets for this is the whole duty of man"" AMEN.",1310342400,15,1370,4.569105691056911

1358664,3,B00004VVP2,"I know they don't make movies to follow everything in the Bible, but what disturbed me is when Solomon was asking children what the 4th commandment was, and they answered quoting the Fifth, or maybe I heard wrong, replayed it and heard same thing.  Exodus 20: tell us what the Fourth commandment is.  Movie script writers need to research more before making movies.  Otherwise it was ok.",1300233600,6,387,4.746268656716418
1358665,1,B00004VVP2,This is a very low budget and poorly done movie. My husband and I were so disappointed with it that we threw the movie away after watching it. They took too many liberties with the story-line. I hope Solomon wasn't like that!,1299456000,16,225,4.380952380952381
1358666,5,B00004VVP2,"I will make this very short.  This was a wonderful production and Ben Cross did a great job in it.  The only issue I had is that the writers did not need to take some of the liberties they did with it.  Was Solomon a womanizer? Yes--look at the many wives he had...Did he marry the Queen of Sheba--Hell no! He didn't have children with her either.  Had they stuck to the plot of people trying to keep him off of the throne and NOT added a false storyline, this picture may have sold far more tickets.  Look at ""The Passion"". Gibson did stick to that storyline for better or worse--with the exception of the evil looking spectre creature following the procession to the cross.

However if you are a Ben Cross fan, this is simply worth the purchase for his performance in it. He was great!",1298678400,6,787,4.319727891156463
1358667,4,B00004VVP2,"I thought Ben Cross did an excellent portrayal of Solomon and the screen writers did not flinch from portraying Solomon's spiritual failures.  The movie was a bit long as there was a lot of screen time devoted to the grandeur of his kingdom as well as his womanizing.  Ah well, what producer could resist that temptation?",1295740800,12,321,4.714285714285714
1358668,5,B00004VVP2,"If you love or want to know or see a bible story in a movie, I highly recommend this movie. Solomon the son of King David, starts with his brother trying to get the throne, but of cause as God said Solomon will be the next king, Solomon gets the throne. The story goes right through to his death. Shows his strong love and relationship with the Queen of Sheba and how that God and the people get angry with him when he starts to  worships other Gods.  Commandment no. 1. You shall have no other gods before me.  2.  You shall not make for yourself an idol.  Well made movie, great actors.",1293235200,32,588,4.168141592920354

1358690,5,B00004VVP2,"Excellent movie. Viewing these Bible story movies has made many things clear to me. Reading from the Bible left many messages unanswered. After watching these movies, much has been made clear to me. Being raised in this era, makes terminology from the Bible,not able for me to understand.
 While watching these movies, it is as if I am going back in time. I have watched the Bible stories with great interest. I watched every bit finally seeing what is being spoken of in the Bible.",1284940800,2,482,4.670588235294118
1358691,4,B00004VVP2,The movie Solomon showed up on time and in like new condition!!  It is a good movie although I think they spent too much time on Queen Sheba(I wanted to see more of his supposedly 700 wives).  I will definitely keep Solomon in my collection of bible movies.,1284076800,2,257,4.333333333333333
1358692,4,B00004VVP2,"This film gives a very entertaining view of Solomon's life. It goes way overboard making Sheba a wife and the mother of his favored heir (no mention of that in my Bible), but it does bring many passages to life.",1280793600,,211,4.3
1358693,5,B00004VVP2,"The Bible - Solomon is an amazing dramatic look at the life of Solomon, most of which I remember from the Bible. It was beautifully done. The settings were gorgeous. The actors were well chosen.

As far as accuracy, I suspect there's a broad range, with some scriptural and some right out of someone's creative mind. It did put things in better perspective for me and I'll enjoy reading those stories in the Bible much more after watching it.

EDITED to say that I had to go to the Bible and read I Kings and the Song of Songs, just to see what was actually there and what wasn't.

I was amazed that so many things I had just skimmed over in the past when I read were so much more interesting now. They were real people and their relationships are a little easier for me to understand (and care about) now.

One amusing thing that I DIDN'T find in the Bible was elephants in the caravan of the Queen of Sheba. It mentioned camels, but no elephants. That makes sense to me because they were crossing the desert, which camels are equipped to do, but I don't think elephants could handle it. I may be wrong, of course.

I'm reading ""Wisdom's Daughter"" at the same time, a book that tells the story from first one character, then another. All of this together makes a study of Solomon stick with me because I'm reading about real people, knowing of course that both the book and the movie used creative license.",1268956800,2,1407,4.3961538461538465
1358694,3,B00004VVP2,"As with several of the other movies in the Bible Collection/The Bible series done by these folks, you will mostly enjoy this one.  There's a pretty accurate Biblical following here, and no hiding the errors (nor the grandeur) of Solomon's life.  Sometimes (of course, it's Hollywood and not from Bible scholars eh?) Solomon's words in the Bible are used in questionable ways/scenarious, but alas, it's not completely pathetic or anything.

Sexuality is borderline at 2 points in the long film (completely bare back shot of Solomon going to a towel from the tub, & Solomon kissing down the navel of what is basically ""hidden"" of the naked Queen from Sheba).

This film focuses heavily on King Solomon's weakness towards the women (which is not something to be hidden, but we don't think BIBLICAL movies need to show the sensuality in a modern ""nudity-type"" way).  The Queen of Sheba is used for a little romance tossed in for the ladies out there <grin>.  You are reminded in this film that Solomon started out fairly well, and worthy of being a faithful son unto King David & unto the God of Israel, but who then falls rapidly and loses MUCH character & faithfulness until the end of his reign on his death bed.  The setting for his son and the House of Israel's rebellion also are understood thru this film.

You'll enjoy the many lessons therein.  However, we recommend fast forwarding thru the 10 seconds or less of Solomon going for his towel and of him kissing down the Queen's front side.  We would like to recommend adding this one too, to anybody's Biblical movie shelf.  But we have one exception which we'll address last herein.

It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but....

The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will ever approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).  Thanks for ""listening.""",1264723200,13,3248,4.856624319419238

1358696,5,B00004VVP2,"King Solomon is known for his wisdom and for his relationship with the Queen of Sheba. This movie shows them both and other aspects of his reign that aren't so well known. This movie is a part of the Bible Collection and was made for TV. But even so it was very well done and the production values for this were pretty high. I was pleased to see that they took their time with this film, and many others in the series, and their work pays off.

Vivica Fox plays the Queen of Sheba in this film and she does and amazing job. I felt the love between these too so well that I cried when they actually had to part. The ending of this film is something I had forgotten which is actually very important in the history of Israel.

This movie is one to see.",1232582400,,749,4.08843537414966
1358697,3,B00004VVP2,"Since I was looking for a scriptural account of Solomon, this version of Solomon was disappointing for me.  Many interpretations of Solomon were thrown together to create the movie. As an example, the relationship with the Queen of Sheba was long and drawn out in the movie and was what I believe to be based on the Ethiopian and Eritrean account of Makeda, not the Bible account of Solomon's encounter with the Queen. As a movie it was good, but not a scriptural representation.",1189987200,12,479,4.7023809523809526

God grants him wisdom and then he proceeds to chase skirt while taxing the people to build a temple. A girl from out of town visits and so he wants some brown sugar!
