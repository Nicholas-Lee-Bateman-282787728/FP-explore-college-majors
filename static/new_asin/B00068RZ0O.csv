2177851,4,B00068RZ0O,I really am impressed by this particular instructional dvd.  Even after the very first try my joints felt so much better.  I am optimistic about refining this modality.  [...],1272931200,4,175,4.9655172413793105
2177852,4,B00068RZ0O,"This is my second dvd from the Garripolis and I have to say I am real pleased. This is specific for  good, short moving meditations that does focus on reducing stress. And believe me- it does just that. If you are familiar with the benefits of practicing yoga or tai chi this is something you really may find a very nice change of pace.
And for those, like me, who don't have time every day to do the longer version- this is a great supplement dvd. In less than 30 mins, Daisy takes you through several moving meditations that really do work on relaxing the mind and body. And this is a perfect dvd to get familiar with QiGong to see if it is something that you will enjoy doing. The Garripolis are excellent instructors and I do have to agree, this would have been nice if they had included a second round of the movements without the dialogue- that would have made this a true five star dvd.
Highly recommended if you find you really need to find alternative ways of dealing with a sometimes too hectic life! This dvd is worth the time. Enjoy!",1267833600,39,1045,4.331632653061225
2177853,5,B00068RZ0O,"Beautifully filmed, very nicely paced.  Made a huge dent in the tightness of stress in my body.  The workout is short, can be done in less than a half hour!  Many of the Qigong movements can be done at work during the day.",1264809600,22,222,4.116279069767442

2177855,5,B00068RZ0O,"This DVD is my first on Qigong.  Lee and Garripoli do a masterful job of teaching so many aspects of this routine so smoothly and effectively that I hardly noticed how much they were teaching me.  This routine is easy and powerful at reducing stress the very first time one tries it! My only wish is that they had repeated the routine again without the commentary, just music, but it is easy to just mute it and play music in the room for a more meditative routine.",1231977600,78,465,4.333333333333333
2177856,3,B00068RZ0O,"This was my first qigong DVD. I use it regularly, but after the first time, I started fast forwarding through all the talking. There is a lot of starting and stopping. It would have been better for me if they had created a separate section for the talking so that the movement could flow more uniformly. Since there are so few movements introduced, I thought it would also be better if more time were spent on each. I have another DVD that has a lot of movements. That one is pure sensory overload, so I don't necessarily think that more movements are needed- just more time spent on each.",1199491200,30,589,4.412844036697248

2177876,5,B00068RZ0O,"This is a truly wonderful dvd. I had been looking for something to replace yoga after suffering from an attack of vertigo while getting up from the floor at the end of a yoga session. This routine begins seated and ends standing. I like that there is no floor work. It has really improved my quality of life because it really is stress relieving, centering, empowering and calming all at the same time. It is not a strain, like some dvds are. I really do look forward to doing it each day. Francesco and Daisy Lee are both wonderful, and I plan to get more of their dvds. You can do this particular routine inside of half an hour, and I highly recommend it. I would give it 10 out of 5 stars if I could !",1443484800,,704,4.145985401459854
2177877,3,B00068RZ0O,This DVD was ok. To me it wasn't long enough. Francesco talked too much with his instructions. Daisy's instuctions were more clear & shorter. Francesco went on and on. Less introduction. More Qigong.,1440979200,,199,5.0606060606060606

2177883,3,B00068RZ0O,"I recently picked up this DVD at a used book sale.  Although I frequently do yoga, I have only dabbled a bit in Qigoing.  However, I have been particularly stressed of late, and I was curious about this DVD's promise (on the case) to provide the ""10 best exercises for reducing stress.""  That combined with the 30-minute length was enough to convince me to give the program a try.

This routine is led by a husband/wife team, Francesco and Daisy Garripoli.  In their 2-minute introduction to this practice, they explain how Qigong involves the harnessing of energy in the body.  The two teach the routine live, alternating in their instruction.  The setting is a pretty outdoor birch tree grove, and the music is soft and unobtrusive.  The total practice time winds up being 24 minutes.

The pair begin seated on stools.  Francesco provides instruction for deep abdominal breathing, which he notes should be used throughout the practice.

Continuing seated, the exercises are as follows:
1.  Cross-arm self-massage
2.  Neck stretches
3.  Rub hands, move energy over body
4.  Rolling the ball

They then move to standing and continue with the following exercises:
5.  Rolling the ball standing
6.  Pushing hands
7.  Alternating slow punch forward
8.  Wave on the ocean
9.  Tapping sequence
10. Conclude with pushing ball of energy down body 3x

I did feel like I experienced an increased energy flow with some of the moves, which I liked.  Overall, however, I found myself distracted by the instruction.  First, Francesco and Daisy do not mirror-cue--this is not a deal-breaker for me in exercise videos, but I found it difficult with this type of practice.  I would have found it more acceptable had they included other form reminders, such as details about the placement of the hands, feet, etc.  I was trying to follow their movements on screen, but unfortunately, neither instructor provided specific enough details verbalizing the entirety of the exercise, at least not for someone relatively new to Qigong.  Furthermore, this was not a flowing practice; rather, between each new move, the instructors would stop and talk about what was coming up rather than providing a more continuous routine.  The end result was that this DVD did NOT wind up relieving much stress for me, and I don't plan to keep it.",1414627200,,2308,4.9246753246753245

2177889,3,B00068RZ0O,"I really like this video but as with lots of videos they do not take the time to make sure their directions are complete.  In exercise in particular and this make me nuts, he says step forward with your right foot and push with your right hand this does not make you look like the picture.  The picture is step the forward with your left and push with your right hand.  Things like this really throw me off balance. They charge enough for these videos, you would think they could edit them properly,",1387756800,,499,4.344086021505376

2177891,2,B00068RZ0O,"I was looking for a DVD of Qi Gong exercises that I could do on a regular basis. I'm new to Qi Gong, so a beginner DVD seemed like the place to start. This DVD has excellent exercises -- but there is so much introductory talking that it's useless as a daily routine. The talks are great the first time you view the DVD (good information), but time consuming and pointless after the first time. I agree with other reviewers: the producers would have been wiser to create a ""full routine"" section without the talking. Also, the DVD includes only a single, 20 minute (w/o the talks) routine: other Qi Gong DVDs include more exercises and more routines, with equal explanations. This DVD, while beautiful and informative, is not a great value.",1385856000,15,739,4.606060606060606
2177892,5,B00068RZ0O,"The Garipolis are very elegant practitioners. Francesco Gariploi is like Cary Grant meets Qigong; flowing and elegant.

The stress relief video has some deep and effective practices to relax and wring out energy to get it flowing well. It is obvious that Daisy and Francesco like each other, and they work well together.

In this video, Daisy is a little awkward a few times, as if she forgets what to say and what she says trails off.

I recommend the Garioli videos, this one and what they call detox or organ cleansing. The cleansing one is unlike anything I have seen.",1383350400,3,572,4.643564356435643
2177893,3,B00068RZ0O,"As someone inexperienced in Qigong, I did not find the instruction in this dvd very useful. I enjoyed the movements, but the instruction was difficult to follow. There was not enough verbal description of the movement and the visual and audio cues were reversed, which made it confusing to follow the new movements. The routine also lacked rhythmic flow. There were a lot of pauses between exercises.",1379635200,2,400,4.985074626865671
2177894,5,B00068RZ0O,This is a very good DVD. Very little chat and once the practice begins it keeps flowing. I appreciate that as I dislike standing in front of my TV waiting for the next instruction.,1377734400,,180,4.323529411764706
2177895,5,B00068RZ0O,"What a joy!  This practice, which is easy to learn and gentle to do, is more that just a short series of benificial exersizes.  I find it to be genuinly calming for both body and mind.  I  then ordered the next dvd - Qigong Beginning Practice by the same couple.  I certainly recommend both.",1372204800,,291,4.314814814814815

2177898,5,B00068RZ0O,"Ahhhh, talk about deep relaxation and stress relief.  The deep breathing, gentle circular movements and calming voices in this workout will soothe you. The beautiful scenery of the Colorado mountainside will also help reduce your anxiety.

Francesco and Daisy alternate giving instruction and they give just the right amount of explanation of why and how for each movement.

I especially love the shaolin punch and the ocean wave movements.  I can really feel the energy vibrating between my hands.
I enjoy doing this workout when I've had a particularly stressful day.  I also do it when I'm feeling a bit under the weather; it always makes me feel better.

Francesco and Daisy don't do mirror cuing, so it can be a bit confusing for some of the more complicated movements.  I found it got easier the more I did the workout.

I recommend this workout to anyone wanting stress relief and a good night's sleep.",1366329600,,909,4.819354838709677
2177899,4,B00068RZ0O,I ordered this video and their longer Qigong for Beginners. Good instruction for beginners; would like to see a section at the end summarizing the movements so you don't have to listen to their dialog every time.,1365984000,,212,4.756756756756757
2177900,5,B00068RZ0O,I've had a neck ache for 2 years and was looking for some relief after 3 months in physical therapy. Daily Qigong exercise was more effective and less expensive than my physical therapy,1365811200,,185,4.636363636363637
2177901,5,B00068RZ0O,"This DVD is certainly great for stress relief. The couple explaining the moves do so in an easy to understand way, and benefit is felt after practicing a few times",1362787200,,163,4.466666666666667
2177902,5,B00068RZ0O,"This is a great Qigong remedy.....I love the Garipollis....they are the best....sometimes they get carried away with their talking, but it brings friendliness into the home",1360454400,,172,5.653846153846154
2177903,4,B00068RZ0O,I can do the moves very well. My only objection is that he is constantly talking through the whole thing. It is hard to concentrate with him doing that.,1358899200,,152,4.275862068965517
2177904,5,B00068RZ0O,"I got this DVD a few years ago with a couple yoga DVDs. I find I'm much more likely to practice with this since its only 20 minutes long and very low impact. Yoga will have you rolling all over the floor and demands a mat and more work-out type clothing, but qi gong is all done in sitting or standing positions, making it very convenient. I tend to feel like I should be doing some errand or chore or being otherwise productive, but since this is only 20 minutes, I can stop my excuses and take the time to slow down and chill out. I find when I'm good about being regular with my practice, my digestion is better and my sleep is better. Francesco mentions how doing just a little can have a large effect- it totally applies to this DVD.

The music is nice and the scenery is beautiful. I saw some people here don't like Francesco's voice so much, but I find him rather endearing and think that both of them are very calm and soothing and seem to just want to give some brief education on the subject. I only just recently realized that everything had been explained to me a hundred times and I like other reviewers' idea to mute it and play music instead. I definitely need repetition, even though the movements are very easy, and I'm finding to my delight that I can remember all the exercises without the DVD now, but I still prefer doing them with the DVD. I had also bought the Qi Gong for Beginners DVD, but much prefer this one's flow. I will definitely be buying the organ cleansing one.",1358812800,6,1496,4.286219081272085
2177905,2,B00068RZ0O,"But the guy is super annoying.  I couldn't stand him.  It's a little like having stuff dictated to you by a televangelist.  Content is good, but I just wish that guy had stopped talking.",1356825600,2,186,4.411764705882353
2177906,5,B00068RZ0O,This is a fantastic DVD and the scenery is incredible.  The Garrapoli's are engaging and informative.  A very good example of Qigong.,1354320000,,133,5.0
2177907,4,B00068RZ0O,"I just got this video a week ago and have worked it a couple of times.  There is a lot of instruction, but I appreciate this as I am just starting :)

The workout itself is about 20 minutes long and the movements vary from simple to complex. I found this pleasing since it allowed me some sense of success.  I'm not graceful as of yet, but I do hope to get there.

My one complaint is that, while there is a lot of guidance in the movement itself, there were parts where I could have used a bit more guidance on the breath.  Being that the breath is so important to qigong, this could have been better.

Besides that, the music was calming and I feel refreshed.  I plan to purchase another one of their videos in the near future.",1347926400,,729,4.127659574468085
2177908,4,B00068RZ0O,"I borrowed this from the public library and absolutely loved all the movements.  Daisy explains the moves and why very well, but I did not like the man when he continued on talking.  I was trying to clear my mind and relax but he just kept talking and talking about everyday stresses which I was working on clearing my mind about!  Hence it not being 5 stars.  So I just used this video for the first few times (with it on mute after the first time!) as I learned each movement and the entire routine, and now I put on relaxation music and go through the routine myself.  This was also my first exposure to qigong (I've done tai chi and yoga before) and the movements were explained thoroughly for beginners.  As others have said, it would have been nice if they just did the routine to music, no talking.  So take my suggestion, mute it and put on some relaxation music of your own.",1335571200,2,883,4.315151515151515
2177909,5,B00068RZ0O,"I made up my mind I was going to give this DVD a real try out to see if QiGong might be of some benefit. I forced myself to keep my mind on the video as I wasn't sure if it would be something for me.  The excellent teaching, the calming background, calming music and voices while trying to do the moves correctly made the time fly. Nearing the end I knew I liked it.  The actual excercise portion seemed only to be 5-10 minutes though it was about a half hour. I took my blood pressure following the routine and it dramatically lowered my high blood pressure!!!! Something so short, so easy, made a huge life change for me. After the introductory lesson it would have been nice to have another session doing the same routine with a little less explaining. Yet, I needed to have the moves and reasons explained well. Worth more than the money paid! Time to see if there is another one by them and I will be doing this daily until the new one arrives!",1330387200,3,949,4.237569060773481
2177910,4,B00068RZ0O,"I felt more relaxed after I finished this DVD.  It doesn't take long and the series of movements are easy to follow.  For an uncoordinated person, if may keep a couple of tries to get the movements down pat.  Overall, it is a very good stress relief DVD and you dont' need much room in your house to do it.",1327881600,,306,4.066666666666666
2177911,5,B00068RZ0O,"It's such a short and easy work out that you can easily believe that it provides nothing. But you'd be wrong.

it's funny the little things that pop up out of nowhere that make me realize that I've absorbed something so fully that it's a part of my life. In the push hands movement, they talk about knowing when to use your own power and it wasn't until i was going through a really crappy time in my life that I realized that I absorbed that teaching. As I was describing what was going on to someone, I stopped short and actually did the push hands movement to demonstrate the use of power.

my favourite routine is the tapping series because it really seems to do something positive for me at all times... before bed, if I'm really sleepy during the day...

I try to practice the work out before bedtime because I find I have a more full, restful sleep and wake up energized.

The work out is about 20 minutes long, easy to fit into everyday.",1326758400,3,945,4.292134831460674
2177912,5,B00068RZ0O,"I originally borrowed this video from the public library.  Within a couple of weeks I was very enthusiastic about Qigong and this video.  I checked out several exercise videos at the time and after watching each, I liked this one best.

I had no experience with and very little idea of what Qigong is before watching this video.  By the time the video was due for return, I was able to do the moves.  I bought a copy of the video in appreciation for the value I got from it, not because I needed to still use it.  I do review every few weeks to fine tune my methods.

The exercises or movements are very clearly demonstrated and explained.  They are relatively low impact.  It takes very little time to do the program.  Now that I'm familiar and comfortable with the routines, it takes 20 minutes or less.  I often do them twice a day.

Another feature of the video I like is two people are doing the routines.  There are slight differences in their techniques.  This helped me realize the moves didn't need to be exactly those of the instructor to achieve benefit.  I'm not very physically adept and have trouble learning physical routines so this is encouraging.

I'm 66 years old and find the program very interesting and relaxing.  I'm feeling much more flexible and aches and pains are disappearing.",1322438400,26,1304,4.551724137931035

I have since purchased a course on-line (Tai-Chi Fusion) and they stress the 40-70% rule of effort.  In that course they teach you the basics which have certainly helped in doing this video.  They combine both disciplines.
With this course, just be careful doing the moves - they are repetitive and doing them too quickly can get you in trouble.  This is just my opinion as a ""newbie"" to Tai-Chi but I'm also in great shape for my 67 yrs as I actively hike and workout.",1302307200,9,668,4.4958677685950414

We both find that it calms us well, and I have recommended it to many friends for relief from sleeping issues as well as to help flexibility and pain levels. I am finding a definite increase in my flexibility as well as my calmness. I notice a big difference in my sleep between days I do the routine before bed and days I don't. That alone has increased how often I do the routine! For anyone working to overcome a major health hurdle like I am, the last part of Garry Garripoli's interview in that part is so encouraging. I watch that when I need a cheerleader telling me I can indeed make it to ""Well."" This one was worth every single penny.",1496793600,2,742,4.232394366197183
