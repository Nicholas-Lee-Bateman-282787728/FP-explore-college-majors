Being able to finally own this brings back those memories and more. Where else could you assemble such a perfect cast. VanNess and Thomas Allen and the perfectly matched Count and Countess. Von Stade is world renowned for her Cherubino and is priceless here. You get to see her close ups as she is being sent ""off to war"" and they are a delight. Susanna is not an easy role, but the petite Kathleen Battle is perfect. Her beauty of voice and person are the perfect companion to Raimondi. I've saved Ruggero Raimondi for last as I feel this is his opera. He owns it without overshawdowing his fellow cast members. His stage presence, sense of humor, his beautiful flexible voice have never been so in evidence as in this performance. I don't think I will ever enjoy a Figaro like his. Maestro Levine gave everything just the right balance between his orchestra and his singers. A more perfect example of artistry in the pit and on the stage are rare, and this is rare indeed. Kudos to all involved, especially our Figaro.",1341187200,18,1182,4.553990610328638
8492799,5,B0064R8618,"This production and performance is the gold standard.  I count myself fortunate to own it.  I have seen many productions of this opera but none so well sung, performed and entertaining.  Some come close.  Comic timing is terrific.",1471305600,,230,4.973684210526316
8492800,1,B0064R8618,"This Ponnelle production of this opera with such a formidable cast is awful. His stage design is dark with dull, dark-green colors. The costumes are dull and the stage light is inadequate, His handling is simply inappropriate for a buffa. With his direction, the sophisticated, good-natured Almaviva is turned into a desire-obsessed, ill-tempered and unsophisticated clod. The Figaro is not lively. The production is not comical, not interesting at all.",1468972800,,453,5.485714285714286
8492801,5,B0064R8618,One of the best versions of this opera out there. But don't be fooled by these gluttonous resellers. This DVD is not out of print and can be found elsewhere for a tiny fraction of the cost seen here.,1426636800,5,199,4.128205128205129

8492804,5,B0064R8618,"From the 40th Anniversary of Jimmy Levine's de luxe box set comes this 1985 Metropolitan 'Le Nozze di Figaro', being Levine's 'Mozart debut'.
Levine may not be a Mozartian, but he has good musical and dramatic sense, and with these two crucial elements, he placed a firm grip on the score and pulled off a more than sterling - indeed outstanding -  performance.
The sets by J P Ponnelle are nothing short of being fabulous period designs, and in a striking contrast, Giorgio Strehler's 'Le Nozze' can be compared for similarly classic, but less extravagant, period elegance.
Of particular visual exaggeration is Cherubino's 'wig' of 'lovelocks' when he first appears, calculating to emphasize, no doubt, the amorous nature of the boy, but really does not serve Frederica von Stade well.
Similarly, the sumptous head gear of Countess Almaviva does not seem to 'sit well' on Carol Vaness.
Otherwise, the characters are beautifully and effectively dorned (a Susanna looking far less like a maid than in any other production).  The best stage presence being awarded to Sir Thomas Allen's infectiously aristocratic and calculating Count Almaviva.
All the leads perform exceedingly well, and even with the infamous 'quarrel' incident at the outset of this production's performances between the two lead sopranos, not one vistage of this could be found in the performance.
It is a pity that Vaness and Battle fell out during this production's performance, for their artistic collaboration in this production is fiercely eminent, as if each was bent in proving that they could make things more perfect than perfect...the rest, of course, is history.
With a cast as well sung (no less than Raimondi's highly versatile Figaro, von Stade's truly mellifluous Cherubino, Allen's vivid Count, Battle's silvery and fluid Susanna, Vaness's sumptuously moving Countess) and marvellously acted (a heartily robust Figaro, charming and wiry Susanna, aloof and suspicious Count, noble and vulnerable Countess, debonair Cherubino), it is a cast that are only matched by the 1974 Giorgio Strehler production and no other.",1379289600,2,2098,5.297297297297297
8492805,4,B0064R8618,"Many years ago there was a classical radio show in New York which began late at night. It was not unusal for the host who clearly had discretion over the contents of his program, to play a version of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze di Figaro) once or more a week and occassionally twice in an evening.

Yes: I too love the music and there are many many good, great and othervise versions available on CD and otherwise.

The DVD reviewed here is a recorded version of a production from the Metropolitan Opera of a few years ago with a performance conducted by James Levine and a solid Met Opera cast.

There is no issue if that is of your mind: you love the opera; you love watching it; you go for traditional productions and costuming; etc. Fine: this is for you.

For those of us that find watching the somewhat dated plot played out, this production adds little that listening to a great recording does not already provide plus that added advantage of no feeling that one must actually be glued to a seat.

Recommended with these qualifications.",1372636800,,1057,4.513089005235602

8492807,5,B0064R8618,"Performance of superstars including James Levine and Metropolitan orchestra. Kathleen Battle is the best Suazana ever!
Carol Vaness as stunning countess sings divinely. The quality of the recording is the great quality of Deutche Gramophon Gesellshaft. Not only the singing of all superstars is excellent but their playing is marvelous. The style is perfectly idiomatic  Mozart. The quality  of the whole DVD is wonderful.
Can be hardly recommended enough.",1353888000,5,456,5.594202898550725
8492808,5,B0064R8618,"I haven't seen every ""Figaro"" available, but I have seen a lot because I've been looking for one this good since my VHS recorded-off-the-TV copy of this production wore out (about 1988). This production is just SO GOOD! Everyone inhabits their roles like a second skin. The world of this one crazy day is complete and utterly convincing. You are totally swept up in the story, the music, the comedy, the tragic elements (all comedies are just tragedies that are avoided), the look, the sets, the costumes... and it's LIVE, on stage. Even with the ""one point"" proscenium view, arias that stop the action and the show as the audience applauds wildly, glimpses (deliberate) of the orchestra and conductor and audience in the house, you STILL get caught up in the characters and story. It's the best filmed stage production ever!
Ponnelle does his usual masterly interpretation of staging as if this were a play, not just an opera. The routines and bits run smoothly and are convincing, and funny when they should be. And yet, he knows when to let the music ""take over"" completely and have the singers stand there and sing to you. His timing and interpretations are impeccable.
All the music is rendered top notch. The singers can act....and act well. But even with all the right elements in the right place, at the right time... this version would be worth owning for only one thing alone: Kathleen Battles unrivaled rendering of ""Deh, viene, non tardar"".",1347148800,18,1452,4.812
