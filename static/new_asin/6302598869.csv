486006,5,6302598869,"Dixie Carter is very informative, funny and her voice is extremly relaxing  to listen to. As a first timer at this she explained everything very well  and made me feel very comfortable. This tape is well worth the money and I  would recomend it to anyone and everyone. You must buy this tape!",968976000,25,292,4.471698113207547
486007,5,6302598869,"Like the other reviewers, I am also achieving the benefits of Ms. Carter's ""un""workout.  This is the first yoga tape I'd ever purchased  (Feb. '99) and at first it took me a few times to get the feel of the  postures and where exactly I was going with  my focus.  I'd never done yoga  before or like, Ms. Carter, considered myself ""athletic"" in any  way.
This tape always makes me sweat and I feel like I've worked every  muscle and strengthened and stretched everything possible. I've received  better muscle tone, less back trouble (as I sit at a desk all day), better  posture, my waist has gotten smaller love those side bends), and I just  feel good all over after an intense ""un""workout.
I decided to  build my yoga library, and Ms. Carter's followup tape was my second choice.  I recently added Bryan Kest's Power Yoga 1 and Jane Fonda's Yoga tape, so  I can alternate and still get a great workout from various instructors and  still get the overall sweating and ""sensations"". I also take one  day off a week to ""rest"", but on that day I do the P.M. portion  of Ms. Carter's ""Unworkout II"" before bedtime for a good night's  sleep.
For beginners, this is **the** tape to start with and it still  remains my favorite due to Ms. Carter's encouragement, instruction, and  sense of humour.",966211200,40,1293,4.563318777292577
486008,5,6302598869,"This video is not only a workout, but it is also relaxing because of the good breathing one must do throughout the exercises. I enjoy this workout tape because Ms. Carter is an extremely good teacher, and she makes the  workout rewarding. The ""cool down"" phase at the end is spiritual  and uplifting! I highly recommend this to beginners.",949795200,17,338,4.711864406779661
486009,5,6302598869,"I have found the best time for me to exercise is the first thing in the morning.  Many days it is hard to get out of bed to jump around and do aerobics.  I look forward to rolling out of bed to do Dixie's relaxing yoga  streaches.  It is a wonderful way to start the day.  As relaxing as the  video is, there is no doubt that I have worked every muscle when I am  finished, and I feel great!",944524800,,391,3.8125
486010,5,6302598869,"I have both of Dixie Carter's tapes, and I must say that her tapes are the best yoga tapes I have tried.  She really knows it.  I am 60 years old and still get many admiring comments.",922665600,16,183,3.918918918918919
486011,5,6302598869,"Miss Carter does a wonderful job of presenting this yoga-based, non-impact workout, adaptable to a variety of fitness levels. Her soothing southern accent, as she talks you through each exercise, helps to maintain the  relaxed, spiritual mood she encourages you to establish early in the video.  You learn body-cleansing breathing techniques, helpful for relaxation and  stress reduction.  The exercises progress into graceful stretching and  strengthening movements, always with the proper breathing techniques.  Expect to break a sweat - this ""unworkout"" is a workout.  As you  persist with this program, the movements become easier, without  compromising the benefits.  A slimmer, toned and more flexible you is the  outcome.  There were not many muscles missed when it came to stretching and  strenghtening!  The video winds down with more quiet time, leaving you  feeling spiritually refreshed, relaxed and with a great sense of  accomplishment. Although you can select the exercises you choose to do, it  is best to follow the video from start to finish. I allow one hour per  session. I highly recommend this video to anyone, of any age.  It has  provided me an opportunity to combine the the ""quiet time"" I need  to allow myself with the exercise I often neglect.
As a sidenote... Miss  Carter says she performs her Yoga routine on a regular basis.  I believe  it.  I saw her show this past year in NY - she wore a very form-fitting  outfit and looked great!",914025600,14,1466,5.054621848739496

7828003,3,6302598869,"I only gave them three stars because I'm not sure how good it worked. My VCR ate it:( Don't know if it was the VHS or the VCR. It(the VHS) may have been fine, but I really don't know. Well now it's not so I threw them both out. Didn't want to ruin another VHS,in the process of figuring it out. So I just bought a new VCR, instead.",1416182400,,331,3.8115942028985508
7828004,5,6302598869,"I wish someone would put this on DVD.  this is the only yoga routine I ever actually want to do.  Dixie makes me happy.
I've been doing this workout since it came out when I was a new, single mother.  some days Dixie's kind, loving words were all that got me through.  my son has graduated college and I still do this tape.  I am on my third copy.",1413244800,,347,3.971014492753623
7828005,1,6302598869,"This is a GREAT workout tape -- I ordered it to replace my old one that has seen a lot of wear. Unfortunately, the new one arrived with a broken tape that was not connected to the right-side winding reel. I didn't even get to use it! Shipping and packaging was great, but the product wasn't.",1406160000,,291,4.214285714285714
7828006,5,6302598869,"I have a tape in storage, but I have been wishing I had easy access to it. A coworker mentioned looking on Amazon for the tape. I was amazed it was there.",1384560000,,154,3.84375

7828008,5,6302598869,Dixie Carter's voice and gentle manner make this a work out that is very enjoyable.  The work out itself is very subtle.  You wonder where the time went at the end of the tape and you feel great.  An easy one to do everyday.,1281744000,,224,4.045454545454546

7828010,5,6302598869,"This is a great video for anyone who wants a good, enjoyable workout.  She is precise & easy to listen to.  She does not hurry thru instructions & gives encouragement thruout the workout. It was nice to find a mature woman I could relate  to.",1244073600,,242,4.333333333333333
7828011,4,6302598869,"The product arrived in a timely manner and was certainly priced right.  I was a little worried about the video quality due to age.  It is not quite as clear as a new one would be, but I have wanted this for some time and was glad to find it.",1240876800,,241,3.8
