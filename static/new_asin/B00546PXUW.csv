8456392,1,B00546PXUW,"I was looking for an exercise program that I could do on my one hour drive in, and back from work, mostly in a dead zone where there is no internet connectivity. Seems this program requires the connection to internet to play it (just that much more revenue for Verizon). I tried downloading and copying to a disc. That didn't work. I downloaded to my iPhone; requires internet connectivity to play. The exercises themselves are basically isometrics, that I've already been doing.  Very disappointing.",1392508800,,500,4.9523809523809526
8456393,4,B00546PXUW,"I learned a lot from this home-grown dvd.  I am not a professional truck or bus driver but drive frequently in my work.  I was surprised at the number of ways they demonstrated to improve fitness while driving and between stops.  I liked that most of the movements were filmed in the cab of a truck at what seemed to be a truck stop just off the highway.  The movements in the truck are demonstrated by the wife while the husband narrates correct positioning.  The truck stop movements are demonstrated by the husband.
I did not like the lack of menu options that make it easy to view different exercise/movements multiple times.  To repeat an exercise,you have to rewind or forward wind like an old VHS.  Other than that, a very worthwhile purchase for me that I will watch again and remember to practice!",1381363200,,806,4.555555555555555
8456394,5,B00546PXUW,"This was the best, easiest and most effective program that you can use to get fit as a trucker or bus driver. Really even a car driver. It makes so much sense to turn your normal idle time into getting fit time. It almost so easy that you don't think it will work, but just follow the easy to do movements and wow, what results.",1336608000,2,328,4.061538461538461
