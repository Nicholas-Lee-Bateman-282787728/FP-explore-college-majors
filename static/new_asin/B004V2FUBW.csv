Mithunda's cult hit 'Dance Dance' is a yet another masterstroke from the legendary actor. Mithunda's performance, dances, action, everything is note-worthy. Mithunda is undoubtedly Indian Cinema's finest actor, touch wood to his success.
'Dance Dance' is a classic anyways, a highly-entertaining watch. A film that makes you groove with it's brilliant music & direction. This kinda stuff is clearly missing today!!!",1305763200,2,654,5.485148514851486
