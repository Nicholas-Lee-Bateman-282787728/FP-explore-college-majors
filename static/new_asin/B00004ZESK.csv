7928579,1,B00004ZESK,"If you are into the spirituality of mountain biking and the whole bike culture this may be the DVD for you.  If you like watching what is currently considered technical riding you will be very disappointed (As an old school 80s freestyler I can honestly say that the majority of the riding in this video wouldn't have been considered even slightly interesting back in the mid 80s.).  The riding in this DVD is at best boring, and the comments by the narrator couldn't be any sappier.  Don't let the fact that Hans Rey is 'featured' on this video delude you, one minute of JIB or Contact contains more trials type moves than this whole DVD.  I still have not been able to watch the entire DVD, it's just too boring.  The DVD does have good picture quality, but I have had some problems with the audio.  When using 6 ch audio on my DVD player the volume comes and goes.  The problem doesn't occur when using the optical output.",1045440000,,925,4.437869822485207
7928580,4,B00004ZESK,"Hooooow, wait up boring? This is a classic one! Espescially the dumb conversations between Hans Rey and Greg H. are super. The hamburger part is disgusting, but who cares about the tacky parts, it`s the riding that counts. And both can do things with bikes no one else can. This is a must have for mountainbikers! If only because of the part with Johnny T.",992476800,3,356,4.492307692307692
7928581,1,B00004ZESK,"Compared to ""New World Disorder"" this one looks like a ""sunday afternoon family mountainbike trip with your mom and dad"". It is the most boring film I have seen in a long time. Dont do the same mistake like me and buy this one - go for the must see ""New World Disorder"" instead!",985046400,3,278,4.166666666666667
7928582,5,B00004ZESK,"Spectacular scenery, awesome technical rides.  Moab...need I say more.  This is a DVD that every moutain biker should have in their collection.  All types of mountain biking are represented from fast single track downhills to rolling leisure trails to dangerous tricks and horsing around.",973123200,3,288,5.5
7928583,5,B00004ZESK,"If you are a hardcore mountainbike junkie with a passion for all things two wheeled, you'll love this flick.  The plot is as complex and calculated as Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail (there isn't one for those who  haven't seen either), but then again that's really the whole point.  Mountain biking in it's epic form really isn't a story or something with a  start or a finish, --- it's an epic journey and and a way of life.  This  film depicts this cult counter-culture in a artful way and highlights many  of the legendary riders who's great riding skills and embassador status  have elevated the sport from fringe following to mainstream passion.  A  must see, but only if you're into this passion.  If you've got shaved legs,  have spent more $$ on your bike than your car, or spend your 3 week's  vacation every year in Durango or Moab, then this flicks' for you.",922406400,,879,4.5576923076923075
