7887109,5,6305301743,"It helps to know the American story of George Armstrong Custer's last stand against the Indians, who by the way won this battle! This parody of that story, taking place in France is full of humor and sight gags, with both a modern background and a historical-era combined to be a surreal vision. Marcello Mastroianni as Custer is a droll sight, with Catherine Deneuve playing the helpless southern woman is spot on, sighing and batting her lashes. Marco Ferreri had just completed ""La Grande Bouffe"" and had all his actors still together so quickly put this idea into play against a background of the demolished Parisian mall and ""challenges the audience to sympathize with the Indians instead of the cowboys"". This might make no sense at all if you are not familiar with the historical battle, which was just as bloody as this one, maybe worse. (Note: blood and gore only last a few minutes, but necessary to convey how bad the real battle was). Found this to be very entertaining and really quite amusing, so maybe if you're a Mastroianni fan, you'd enjoy it anyway.",1311033600,,1068,4.747311827956989

I agree those who enjoy the Marx Brothers should look at this film, but I think it's more for the fan who looks beyond the surface humor of the Marx Brothers. The humor is subtle, sometimes too subtle for its own good, but it's on the mark. The production values are spartan at best, but overlook the deficiencies; this film has a lot to say. Cozy up to it with a cup of hot coffee and a discerning eye and enjoy.",976579200,11,459,4.2272727272727275
7887111,4,6305301743,"...a little bit more, if you knew the small facts around it: Marco Ferreri just finished shooting ""La Grande Bouffe"" (As well, the 4 main actors are the same as in ""La Grande Bouffe"") when the works for  the Paris' subway RER produced a big hole in the middle of the city (Les  Halles). When he saw that hole, he thought it was the most perfect stage he  could get for shooting his next movie. But since he could not put the  subway works on a full stop, he had to make it in a hurry, hence some  shortcomings in the final output. When you'll see this one, just keep in  mind that most of the scenes in this movie were almost improvised on the  spur of the moment. Those who like the Marx Bros should enjoy this one.",961286400,10,716,4.107913669064748
