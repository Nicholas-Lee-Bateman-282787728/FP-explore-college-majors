4498656,4,B004YAEB6Q,"This review is for the video. There are two versions of the mini-series on DVD now. As recently as three years ago it wa snot on region 1 for American viewers.

Armand Assante is Odysseus. No offense to Sean Bean (A Great Actor In His Own Right), but I could not see him as Odysseus in the film Troy. How I wish that they had again recast Assante (Assuming He Would Have Wanted To Return To The Role). Assante carries this mini-series, and although 10 years older than Bean is, and a little heavier, he also has the muscle to back up the part.

This mini-series concentrates very little on the events of the Trojan War (And Sack Of Troy Itself); instead it concentrates on the long voyage Odysseus has to take in returning to his homeland of Ithaca (For The War With Troy See: Troy & Helen Of Troy). Odysseus has insulted Poseidon, the God of the sea. As a result, his journey is wracked by delay and hardship. Along the way he encounters Cyclops and a beautiful witch that changes his men to animals. Odysseus overcomes these travails and in the depths of Hades discovers the route home from Tiresius, only to have his crew destroyed by monsters and a steep waterfall.

Saved by Calypso (Played By The Gorgeous Vanessa Williams), a beautiful nymph on the Island Ogygia, Odysseus spends several years having blissful sex with her and her handmaidens. Yet his blissful captivity will end when Hermes, messenger of the Gods, tells Calypso to send Odysseus home.

Odysseus returns home only after a scolding from Poseidon. It is then that Odysseus realizes how much he in fact needs the Gods. His makeshift boat has disentegrated, and Poseidon lets Odysseus know who the Gods are and who the mortals are. Poseidon is a God and Odysseus a mere mortal. It is a painful lesosn he has had to learn. The next day he is washed ashore and by way of Phaecian traders, returns to Ithaca.

Once in Ithaca, Athena puts a shroud disguise over Odysseus, making him recognizable only to his son Telemachus and a trusty servant.

In Ithaca he sees those who would steal his land and wife from him. He tricks them into a large room and mercilessly slays them all. The mini series ends shortly thereafter.

Yes, I know that there were large batches of the poem that were left out. But you must remember that they had to edit out portions to be able to broadcast it on TV. Perhaps the series should have been three or four parts, but I have no problem with the eventual format. The sirens and a few other interesting scenes had to be removed. I liked this production. It held my interest and I must say that it was head and shoulders above the subsequent Jason & the Argonauts in 2000.

I liked the supporting cast members. Christopher Lee, Eric Roberts, Bernadette Peters and Isabella Rosallini and Vanessa Williams were all incredible. The special effects were quite solid for a TV mini-series. I have no complaints from that realm. Unfortunately the bloodshed in the end seemed to create a pall on the production. This was a little unsettling for me. Odysseus showed no mercy to those who had been at the very least rude and crude in his household. Their actions had been affirmed by the Ithaca Assembly. Was Odysseus right in slaying them all? I think not. Some should have been condemned to the collar, but wholesale slaughter, no! He showed no mercy to those helpless men.

I plan to buy this DVD when I have the opportunity. This is the fifth review overall and the first Four-Star review.

4498657,5,B004YAEB6Q,I can remember watching this in grade school and it stuck with me.  I also am fascinated by greek mythology.  I bought this a while ago on two vhs tapes and since then have been looking for it on dvd or bluray.  Works great.  Thank you!,1359676800,,236,4.065217391304348
4498658,5,B004YAEB6Q,I remember this movie when it came out in the mid to late 1990's. It was fabulous then and it does not disappoint now! I am so glad to have this in my DVD collection! Thank you!!!,1357516800,,179,3.864864864864865
4498659,1,B004YAEB6Q,"See above. I bought it to play in my English class. When I started the movie, it was in a completely different language, and it was totally useless to me. Didn't spend a fortune on it, but still.",1354492800,17,195,4.157894736842105
4498660,3,B004YAEB6Q,"Excellent for classroom use but sub-titles don't always work.  Still, I do use it in class where international students are enrolled.  It arrived in good condition.",1352160000,,164,5.269230769230769
4498661,5,B004YAEB6Q,"This movie is a splendid presentation of Homer's ""Odyssey"", beautifully photographed and acted.  A worthy companion to the book.  Thank you.",1337212800,13,140,5.619047619047619
4498662,4,B004YAEB6Q,Quality DVD but you must choose English as language,1412726400,,51,4.777777777777778
4498663,2,B004YAEB6Q,"Excellent film.
Took what seemed like months to arrive and when it did it was in an undecipherable language. Some form of Arabic. If something's in a different language YOU NEED TO SAY SO!!!",1405123200,,190,4.617647058823529
4498664,4,B004YAEB6Q,"This film (mini-series) of Homer's Odyssey is a mixed experience. Some sections are ""right on""--the poem brought to life! Other sections have so many things that are ""inventions""--things/events from one part of the poem that are stuck into another part, or events that never occurred--and as a student of Homer, these inventions are quite frustrating. Overall, it is well-worth watching if a bit imperfect!

As a note--be careful when buying a copy that the one you purchases has English as its default language on the disc. I made the mistake of purchasing a copy that had been dubbed from English into Thai. Showing the film to freshman English classes with the constant issue of having to select the language--namely, the original language of English!--proved incredibly frustrating. As the saying goes, ""Beware Greeks bearing gifts!"" or in this instance, ""Beware a DVD at a much lower price! The ""savings"" may not be worth it!"" Perhaps the best reminder is ""caveat emptor""--""Let the buyer beware""!",1402704000,2,1001,5.141104294478527
4498665,5,B004YAEB6Q,"I enjoy this movie greatly.  the only thing I wasn't happy about is I had to go to the sub screen and select ""English"" as my language of choice before I watched it because the primary language was defaulted to some other language.",1389744000,,230,4.348837209302325

4498669,1,B004YAEB6Q,"Do not order this dvd.  There is no indication in the listing that it is dubbed in a foreign language.  On the back of the dvd case the summary is written in what looks like Arabic, but of course they don't show that in the listing.  I will never purchase from this seller and I recommend no one else do so, because clearly the listing is misleading.",1385078400,3,350,4.1940298507462686
