4387581,4,B004ISM6E8,"From my wife Sarah: From the previews I expected a silly slapstick romance, but found that this was a drama, romance and comedy rolled up into one movie. It had surprising depth, character and story development. It was kind of a believable story. There were times I was touched enough to be tearful, and there was some decent chemistry between the leads. There were some laughs as well.

It was good, but was it fantastic? Not so much. Honestly, it wasn't strong enough for me as either a comedy, romance or drama to be terrific. Regardless, it was entertaining, moving and worth seeing.",1286582400,86,587,4.699029126213592

falls flat at the end with Messer saying something about this was all suppose to happen or meant to be? really?!

It's about two people who couldn't be more wrong for one another whose best friends die and leave them their daughter to raise.

4387679,4,B004ISM6E8,"Life as We Know it

 Katherine Heigl has definitely found her niche in the movie universe.  She is shaping up to fill the space vacated by Meg Ryan as the female romantic lead of this decade.  Life as We Know it is her forth such film in four years.  It continues a string of successful films which began with the spectacularly popular Knocked Up and has continued with 27 Dresses, The Ugly Truth and now Life as we Know it.  She is on to a good thing and I hope she can pump out a few more of these entertaining effervescencents before she runs out of steam.
 Her co-star is Josh Duhamel, a relatively unknown actor that now must be considered as an up and comer.  He is perfectly cast as a good looking, easy going, happy-go-lucky sexual athlete.  He is smooth enough to keep his bedroom filled with a succession of one nighters and crass enough to be perfectly happy doing so.  Josh Lucas plays a wise, caring doctor and provides the third point of the romantic triangle in the Heigl-Duhamel relationship.  He seems like he really is wise and caring, good acting I suppose.
 The two stars play people who are not attracted to one another what so ever, the exact opposite in fact.  Heigl is a straight laced striver and Duhamel a casual slacker mostly interested in the next girl he can charm into his bed.  They are thrown together by FATE when their mutual and dear friends are killed and name the unlikely pair as guardians to their baby daughter.  I won't be giving anything away if I tell you that the responsibility for the very cute baby girl makes the couple grow gradually into a, well, a couple.  And we are pleased to watch it happen.
 This is a very conventional romantic comedy.  It is as predictable as a Kabuki play, following precisely the requirements of the genre.  This does not mean that it is not an enjoyable one hour and 52 minutes, quite the contrary.  I admit that I am a sucker for romantic comedies, but doesnt that give me a better perspective on them?  I liked Heigls other romances very much and also this one.  We don't always need to be surprised to be entertained.  Im sure the producers will be able to recoup the $38 million budget on this average but enjoyable three saw blade romantic comedy.",1479600000,,2231,4.454320987654321
4387680,3,B004ISM6E8,"No one would accuse Katherine Heigl (or Josh Duhamel for that matter) of being a great actress. This is a fairly predictable, feel-good chick flick. Good for a rainy day, but I wouldn't give up a nice day to sit and watch it.",1479254400,,225,4.255813953488372

4387688,1,B004ISM6E8,"This movie had a cute premise, so we decided to give it a try without reading reviews first.  That was a mistake.  While there were some redeeming things about it, like they did not oversimplify the baby's transition to the loss of her parents, and the adults' transitions were also not instant or totally unbelievable, there were so many faults that I cannot recommend it.  The first fatal flaw for me was that the lead male was addicted to sex.  He had absolutely no interest in the women he brought ""home"" other than as a one-night stand.  It continued throughout the entire movie, making it unbelievable that he would ever stay faithful to the woman if they did marry.  He was funny, sweet with the baby, etc, which made his heartless womanizing too contradictory to his character, and it was disturbing seeing him with yet another naked woman.  The second fatal flaw was that they flaunted drugs.  Both the baby's parents and the guardian couple did drugs, and there was a scene where the guardian couple got high with the baby awake in the next room.  Although there were some cute, funny, or poignant scenes, overall I wish I had not wasted an evening watching it.",1477267200,3,1171,4.645631067961165

It was a good idea that could have been a charming and lovely movie but it just never goes anywhere.  It is so badly done that they show the couple all grossed out over a dirty diaper when they've had this baby several days already.  Makes you wonder if that baby has had that diaper on since they picked it up from CPS.  I really wanted to like this movie but it is just impossible to like it.  Even with the same script if they'd had much better actors it still may have been successful.  As is, it's just a mess.",1458000000,,664,4.140625

4387854,2,B004ISM6E8,The trailer is good. But the actual movie is.... not really as happy as you'd like it to be. SPOILER ALERT: they're guilted into being a family and end up liking each other after hating one another for a long time. If this wasn't a movie I'd think they got divorced 10 years later once the kid was stable enough to understand. Not a lot of chemistry between the leads either. I haven't been impressed by either of their performances in most movies.,1438387200,2,448,4.409638554216867

4387867,4,B004ISM6E8,"Holly'(Katherine Heigi) and 'Eric'(Josh Duhamel) had already been set up for a date by close friends, the date ? well it just didn't happen as they take an almost instant dislike for each-other.
So, when, the same friends that had set them up are killed in a road accident . 'Holly' and 'Eric' are bemused as to why they had been named as baby 'Sarah's' guardians along with being left the 'fine' home to bring the tragic couples child up in.
Well, neither have a clue about looking after a child, so both were on a steep learning curb.
The two still don't really get on and try to pursue both their social and career ambitions as before while caring for baby 'Sarah'
Both 'Holly' and 'Eric; soon love and care for 'Sarah' however neither could see the obvious, their friends and babysitter however could.
This is a predictable but charming tale which obviously has all the ingredients for the laugh-out-loud comedy that shines throughout the film, also has one or two touching moments which added together gives great entertainment value.",1436227200,,1039,4.745856353591161

4388024,5,B004ISM6E8,"This is a delightful movie.

A man and a woman who met on a blind-date-from-hell, who tolerated each other for the sake of their best friends who got married so near the beginning of the movie, I tend to think of that marriage as being before the movie started.

Two years later, our tolerable friends find themselves parents of their best-friends' child, so they learn to more than tolerate each other. They learn, over time, to get along together, to work for the best interests of their daughter.

I hate to say it, but one of my favorite scenes is when we see the tweenage babysitter trying to hide her admiration for the baby's new father. Looking back on when I was married, 30 years ago, I can think of two tweenaged friends of my stepdaughter who seemed to find excuses to be near me at odd times. Back then, i didn't realize what those young ladies might have been trying to non-verbally express to me, but now, I'm careful not to allow myself to even be in a position where something like that could occur.

Also very familiar to me is the twisting and turning that a couple must make in their planning. How many of us wanted to push our responsibilities off on our spouse when we felt that what we needed to do was more important that what our spouse needed to do? Yes, in some cases, it is obvious that both partners had equally important tasks, but we all must learn to compromise.

I originally saw this a couple of years ago when some friends played it one weekend. A few weeks ago, I had the chance to watch it again when I got a free 24-hour-rental from Amazon, and I will be able to watch it again later, because I got the free rental with my purchase of the DVD.

This is a very enjoyable movie. So far, I have watched this movie four times, and I look forward to watching it again later.

I highly recommend this move to you.",1412380800,3,1845,4.315028901734104

They didn't even like each other at this point but were forced to live together and parent the child. I bet you can guess the ending, too!",1401667200,,283,4.461538461538462

And apparently the wifi/internet was bad and I only got to watch a second of it and I was really looking forward to watching it and I couldn't watch anymore because of the poor wifi.

Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are a great duo together.",1401148800,,352,5.0
4388136,5,B004ISM6E8,Good cast. I have watched this movie several times and periodically rent it again. There is a nice story line about life and some of its unexpected circumstances. The people in this movie have to make decisions that affect their futures. It does involve their romance but it's much more than that. Has lots of funny moments as well that you may be able to relate to.,1401148800,,366,4.477611940298507

4388151,1,B004ISM6E8,Katherine Heigl is awful.  Jesus.  Talk about someone getting a lucky break.  I've seen my share of crappy movies but the macabre premise of this one (really? orphaned baby leads to opposites attracting? um...eff you see kay you) was unpalatable enough without such crappy acting.  This movie sucks all kinds of wet snot.,1399075200,,321,5.0

4388153,5,B004ISM6E8,Great romance comedy.  Its a little different of the usual love movies.  Like that it used real situations that couples would go through in this type of setting. Great movie.,1398643200,,174,4.766666666666667

4388161,5,B004ISM6E8,Life really was not as we know it now after watching this movie.  It shows you what you should learn.,1396137600,,101,4.05
4388162,1,B004ISM6E8,"The movie had some good humor to it, about raising a baby relative to 2 people who were initially clueless.  But the story line was far fetched and weak and pedictible --- presuming that 2 unmarried Godparents who don't even like each other, should  live together to serve as guardians for  little Sophie.  What kind of ""friends"" would set up their friends for that situation?  It's absurd.  The living together was either bound to fail, since the 2 Godparents didn't really hit it off from previous encounters.... or since Hollywood wants the viewer to see a happy ending......  after they slept together, then everything changed (how predictable).  But, actually, in the end, the viewer isn't even certain that the Godparents even got married --- they just stayed living together...."" like a family"" .  This ""family""  began in such a bizarre way --- based on convenience and ""following a will"" --- not based on a mutual covenant or love and respect, which should be the basis of a successful marriage.  In 3 years, the couple probably has a better than 50% chance of NOT being together.  And, that's not funny at all.  Then, too, the baby girl, Sophie, suffers again... watching her ""adopted parents"" separate.  That's predictable.",1396137600,,1233,4.922330097087379
4388163,1,B004ISM6E8,"It's real hard to make a comedy about two people dying and leaving their baby to a couple who hate each other.  That pretty much sums up this movie.  Don't bother watching this movie if you want to have fun or are in the mood for a good laugh. All of the jokes are at the expense of moral and functioning families.  They have the obese wife who wears the pants in the family and bosses the husband around constantly (and we are supposed to laugh at it), most of the married couples and yelling at each all the time (and that is normal and how people express love), the main actor whose main goal in life is to hook up with every female he meets, the main couples first kiss is also their first time in bed, etc. etc.  The stupidity goes on and one.

There is also the now-mandatory scene with marijuana - expect to see this in every movie from here on out.  The liberals want you to believe that everyone smokes, or has smoked, and this is normal.  Just another way to desensitize young people to the many problems associated with it.

What happened to creative movies with great comedy?",1396051200,6,1087,4.294117647058823

4388172,5,B004ISM6E8,It was a cute movie about being thrust into parenthood when baby's parents died and following their wishes.  It did not make life a snap without any problems but showed all adjustments that had to be made by two single adults.  It was very comical the trials and errors both made.,1394841600,,280,4.470588235294118

I'm writing this review after watching it a few weeks ago so I can't remember all the details such as their names or what not, terrible I know, I should have done my homework!

4388242,4,B004ISM6E8,Typical chick flick. Love all Katherine Heigl and all her movies. This one isn't any different. Although it gives one something to think about. Would you sign on to take care of a friends child if they were to die suddenly. If you say yes do you know all that it entails? Aside from being a typical romantic comedy it throws two people together in an unorthodox situation and we get to watch them make the best of it.,1388275200,,417,4.291139240506329

Both Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl carry this film from the first frame to the last and it plucks every heartstring that people have down deep in their hearts.

It is about when life gets turned around and you face what you normally do not expect. How one would tackle such a thing but still maybe just maybe finding love for something still. I liked the humour ofcourse every now and then even though it does gets a litle tacky and over the top. But still who doesn't enjoy alitle bit of satire? This movie ""tackles"" some great choices though. 1. love. 2. ups and downs. 3. making a choice. The chemistry is alright but mostly it felt like Katherine Heigl were the only one giving into the character part fully. In the end though it does take up some really good stuff and therefor it still gets a 4 starred rate from me. Hope you will like it!",1375056000,2,837,4.2375

4388382,4,B004ISM6E8,"What would you do if your best friends were lost in a car accident and you had to care for their one year old child? This movie covers that scenario by playing little Sophie in the care of her godparents, two people who can barely stand to be with one another.

The movie covers their difficult, and sudden, transition from inadequate caregiver to full blown parent vis a via mastering the many complicated tasks of raising a child.

This movie wasn't all that funny, but was quite entertaining. There was a scene involving some face to baby feces contact that was made for a somewhat funny/awkward moment.

Most of the movie involves the new ""parents"" trying to adjust their lives as they take on the added responsibility of raising a little one. In adjusting their lifestyles, they begin to realize all that they have in common, even if it didn't seem that way before the unfortunate accident. Then comes the ultimate test, when Messer is given the chance of a lifetime opportunity  to improve his career. He is left with a very difficult decision to make: pseudo family life with Holly and Sophie or dream job at a major sports newscasting center.

The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I'm sick of the story line where the guy can sow his wild oats with countless numbers of women while the women is expected to essentially wait for him to settle down and become marriage material. In my mind it makes women seem weak and desperate, not a message we should be sending to our young women (or any women to be honest).",1372377600,,1530,4.509025270758123

Heigl and Duhamel have great chemistry and the supporting characters are pretty great as well. The characters are very relatable. The story is fairly predictable, but even so, you want to watch the whole film just to see the main characters work out their issues. The humor is tasteful. A lot of rom coms are moving towards slapstick and cheap sexual quips but this film is very pleasant as far as the script and it will make you smile.",1366156800,,579,4.420560747663552

The gay couple represented a family is not right.  Love all people and accept them yes, but don't lie to them.  That is not natural and the world would end if everyone was homosexual... i.e. no procreation.

All in all good for some laughs, but not something to share with the kids.",1366156800,,476,4.119565217391305

4388528,5,B004ISM6E8,"It is a wonderful change to review a movie I really like.  Most of what I see are ovies that make you wonder why they were ever made:  bratuitous sex, excessive violence that adds nothing to the story, terrible script and characterization and attrocious acting.  If like me you no longer watch television because you can't stand the advertisements, you will suffer for the first ten minutes the disk plays.  Live with it an denjoy the show when it eventually comes on.

I am no authority on the thesbian arts, but this seems very well acted.  Special effects are minimal (I saw no evidence of any) which may turn you off.  Basic story is this:  a young couple with an infant daughter make out wills in which they state in the event of both parents dying ast one, the guardianship of the child is to be split between a male and female friend neither of whom is married.  The parents die, guardianship goes to this couple who don't like each other much, and the story unfolds from there.  Humor plays a good part in this film.  Not slapstick or late night type but just good fun.  I ordered this movie for a lady I know and decided to screen it before giving it to her.  Another copy has been ordered for her.  Copies have been ordered for a friend about to have a child and another who is a single mother of a young child.

If you like films that express real humor, human feelings and a good story, buy, rent or steal this movie.  You will probably like it.",1365724800,5,1457,4.340740740740741

And as for ""transformation"" of their relationship, there was little more than a date, some wine and then sleeping together. What could have been a heartwarming story turned out to be a crude and cheap depiction of 2 people who were sold on the lie that sex is all you need for a good relationship.

4388580,2,B004ISM6E8,"WARNING: Don't read this review if you intend on watching the movie. It exposes plot errors that will ruin the movie for you.

I was relieved to see that this movie was disliked when it was first released (4.6 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes.) I would have been disappointed if this was a highly rated film and maybe I just didn't get it. Unfortunately, I picked this movie as one that my spouse and I could watch together and it was a mistake. We both found the plot to take twists and turns that were implausible.

The issue was not that two God parents could end up as full time parents. That is very rare, but movies are about the unusual and/or extraordinary, so building a script around that premise was good, but the male in this movie was written to be too macho and stereotypical. The male is written to be a carefree, man-whore, but he is slammed into the role of being a good parent through weak and implausible scenes that give the audience whiplash. He starts looking he might have a trace of fatherhood in him when he suddenly is offered a job in another major market. He decides to leave his alleged love and responsibility behind to chase the job, which is a major statement about his commitment. The movie then attempts to erase his abandonment in two scenes that make you wonder whether he has a split personality disorder or just the attention span of a gnat. In either case he's not someone who should be raising a child.

Other plot elements (the joint ownership of the house that she attempts to sell without his approval, to name one) make the movie have all the quality in plot development (writing and editing) that one would expect in a 1970's porn film. The romantic relationship she has with the Pediatrician ends so abruptly that I have to wonder if he was really a married man who was stringing her along and took the first excuse to bail out.

This movie is a Romantic Comedy that could have been great, but it's not.",1361404800,2,1945,4.439775910364146
4388581,5,B004ISM6E8,Nice easy movie....fun time...Like family movies....acting was fine...predictable...but kind of figured that going in....rented it to watch on a plane ride...was not disappointed.,1361404800,,179,6.826086956521739
4388582,5,B004ISM6E8,My wife and I enjoyed this movie. It plays on your emotions from the get go and it really hits home what could happen if you have young children. It has a lot of humor and the Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel were a great team in this movie. I recommend this movie for parents and anyone who enjoys a laugh with the inevitable of the two stars of the movie falling in love but that is the only part of the movie you can guess.,1361145600,,426,3.9651162790697674

4388592,5,B004ISM6E8,I we had more like this in the world would be allot less killing see when you find your true mate in life and you never ever cheat on her and love and be willing to say sorry no matter if your right or wrong in life your wife will stay with you the rest of your life because she see you care for her no matter what if she is right or  wrong in life.  When you get old one day do you want a lady that is your real mate see if you find your real mate she will stand by your side to the last minute in life.  But the man all most please her as will meaning in everything thing see a lady has the same feeling as men do want the same things and a realy lady should be treated as real lady and queen love her be nice to her help her stand by her side no matter what kiss her hug her cuddle up to her at night I do not care if you get hot stay close to her because one day one of you want be here and you wil look back and wish you could relive your life and you never get that chance again when you look back at life it is like a flash of light never ever see your mate again.

4388595,5,B004ISM6E8,Katherine Heigl is one of my favorites and this was a truly sweet story. I cannot imagine having a guardianship responsibility and especially with someone you did not truly know.

4388599,4,B004ISM6E8,"Easy to recommend. This movie was well made, a little sad, a lot funny, fairly original and thoroughly enjoyable.  The actors performances were way above average and spot on.  I cannot think of one thing negative to say about it.  I probably should have given it a 5 star rating, thing is, this is not my favorite genre so a 4 star rating means see it if you get the chance!  Just my opinion.  I do not have the time for a full blown review that others have all ready written anyway.",1359590400,,483,4.206521739130435
4388600,1,B004ISM6E8,"I rarely use reviews to make my decisions about watching films. Wow, I wish I had read the one star reviews as they are pretty accurate. This film's characters are not too likeable, and the baby is relegated to as one guy in the movie stated, an accessory. Never mind the baby, the adults are what the film is about. Or simply put, it's what it turns out to be. If you want a romantic comedy, then have one, but leave the baby out of it. No these two would make awful parents if they were really like this. Why they had to drag the poor baby into it I don't know. Well even with a cute baby, it's hard to sell a film with so-so acting, and characters with very little appeal. I am sorry the motorcycle got wrecked, and I am sorry the child had to suffer through with ill prepared fill ins for ""parents"".
And yes, it was very sad to hear the baby cry so much.",1359590400,4,858,4.052941176470588

We realize opinions and tastes vary but I cannot fathom the overall praise this movie garnered.  The characters are unlikeable and vapid.  The child is very cute but honestly all you feel is pity for her inheriting these two messes for ""parents."" Plot and outcome are uninspired and predictable. Acting is wooden, and beyond the child and ""Dr. Sam"" you can't find a sympathetic character.  Frankly watching this poor child crying all the time was rough; at her age the tears are real and all you want is someone to help her; baby dropped, baby shoved down, baby ignored, baby crying over wasted rental--ok, the last one was me. Both my wife and I felt that giving this one star feels like a gift.",1357084800,10,806,4.5

This movie is a typical romantic comedy but the acting and the directing/cinematography took it to a new level. It is well paced and the shots and lighting are so well done that this film is quite pretty to watch. But the real reason that you will want to watch this movie more than once is the acting of Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. So many times in romantic comedies the acting falls short and the movie drags on seemingly forever. That is definitely not the case here. Katherine Heigl makes highly improbable situations believable and Josh Duhamel does a yeoman's job keeping up with her. There are laugh-out-loud moments as well as teary-eyed scenes.

4388672,1,B004ISM6E8,"I only watched this movie because I subscribe to HBO and it was free on demand.

Spoiler alert: It sucked.

The beginning shows Katherine Heigl getting ready for a date with the overused 'zoom in on woman applying lipstick' shot. Josh Duhamel, her blind date, shows up an hour late and clearly couldn't care less. They stutter through small talk, she discovers he didn't even make a reservation, he accepts a call from a woman he clearly has intimate relations with, she storms out of the car and they decide to blow the whole thing off.

Unfortunately their best friends are married to each other and name them godparents of their baby, which means that in the unlikely event of their death they are granted custody.

Guess what happens?

I won't spoil the ending, but once again I'm reminded as to why I don't watch these types of movies. Woman has successful career but lackluster love life, man has successful career and doesn't want to be tied down, meets successful career woman who makes him rethink his ways, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's just so...typical.

Maybe it would have been better if Katherine Heigl contracted some disease from Josh Duhamel and they were forced to be together because of it. Like it was so bad the government wouldn't let them leave the house and spread it to other people. But the disease turned out to be the same disease that killed the parents (oops, did I give away too much?) and the baby is the only one immune. She's like a super baby, and instead of 'Life As We Know It' it's called 'My Parents Chose These Idiots As My God Parents And Now They're Dead And The Idiots Contracted The Same Disease But I'm Immune Because I'm A Super Baby'.

4388678,1,B004ISM6E8,"Hard to highly rate this movie.  It has an interesting premise: 2 acquaintances forced to perform their roles as Godparents. To make it easier, the premise includes a mortgage-free fully-furnished mansion, non-involved family members of the deceased, comfy neighbors, a helpful CPS agent, plus each Godparent is blessed with good looks, cool lifestyle, and an enviable job. Even better, the set styling was gorgeous, and the orphaned child was a cutie pie. So, it should have been easy to make this film work, right? No, not this time.  Not only are the 2 main actors too old for this script, but each insisted the audience pay attention to them personally and not to the film's story.  For example, the dialogue had these 2 speaking and behaving as if they were, oh, around 20 years old, which I take from the apparent age of the actors, they are not.  Also as her contribution, Ms. Hiegl apparently decided to go all out and do her own makeup for this film.  She insisted on piling on enough hair highlighting, and eye and lip makeup to make her look like something right out of ""Toddlers and Tiaras"".  Owwww, it hurt to watch! Those lips, those eyes...please put them back in the bottle!!  And wait, just in case you weren't giving her enough attention, Ms. Hiegl consistently overacted every scene.  Of course, she probably doesn't realize when people do this in real life, other people avoid them.  To Mr. Duhamel's credit, while not being able to avoid Ms. Hiegl's hammy antics, he gamely responded with his own version of hamming and overacting.  Thankfully, he did it wearing minimal highlighting and face makeup or I would've had to shut the movie off.

Heigl's  and Duhamel's characters were vapid, immature, and whiny.

They got into a fight after their one ""night together"".  Duhamel should have ditched her for being too clingy.  Of course he should take the promotion--don't hold him back.

Duhamel's shining moment was when he was silently sitting in the airport looking at a video of Heigl and the baby and a sweet old lady had to plant the notion in your brain that they made a cute family.

Heigl came off scatter-brained and, well... stupid.  I was pretty offended--I'd held her to higher esteems prior to this movie.

Yes, it's a little formulaic and you know these two will end up together, but it's the journey that makes it worth watching. Josh Duhamel was great and honest in his role as the lovable slacker, and Katherine Heigl did a good job as well, although I am getting tired of seeing her play this same tense, Type A character in every movie. I did like that these two had careers that aren't explored too often in movies--refreshing. On the down side, I thought they could've started the movie in a better way, it felt very flat and negative rather than being amusing, which it should have been, and so it took me a little bit to warm up to the characters. Also, the parents of the baby were very stagnant and so I hardly missed them when they were gone.

4388717,4,B004ISM6E8,"What's the old axiom for actors?  Never be in a scene with a baby or an animal?  Well, such is the case with LIFE AS WE KNOW IT; the very nano-second this rom-com starts to devolve into predictable, contrived mush we suddenly have Baby Sophie spit up on one of the characters, or throw food--or just coo on camera.  Alas, the viewer is smiling again, and the story begins anew as two misfits take on the task of raising their best friends' daughter.

Katherine Heigl has more or less made an art form playing uptight perfectionists; here she clones that mode once again (but is she ever easy on the eye).  And Josh Duhamel is okay as the ex-jock/womanizing/immature young dude (Ashton Kutcher wasn't available?).  So with two almost unlikable characters paired with a cute toddler this film entertains due to the immensity of the story--parents tragically killed; a baby with no one else to raise her; two polar opposites coming together to do what's in the best interests of the child.  The subsequent moments are both charming and bittersweet; there is always a subliminal component of angst and wistfulness lurking.  The plot is, of course, formulaic and predictable, you can see the ending coming from ten pre-schools away, yet none of the above takes away from LIFE AS WE KNOW IT being as cute as a dimple on a smooth, soft chin.  Gitchy-gitchy-goo.

That rating is a very appropriate and suitable for this movie. This story portrays two single adults that are to become caregivers to their friend's girl if their mutual best friends die in an accident. Though Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) don't get along very well, they are determined to figure out their problems for the sake of baby Sophie.

After a nightmare blind date, Holly and Eric swore not to see each other again. Their very best friends had a baby and appointed them as the as the baby's guardians in an unexpected case of their death. The unexpected event occurred and the ""enemies"" has to raise their friend's baby together. There are many obstacles, ups and downs, and problems that they try to fix and work out...

The amazing film by Warner Bros. Picture has great acting pretrial. Ian Deitchman and Kristen Rust Robinson wrote this movie beautifully with touches of seriousness, silliness, and humor. The cast really fit their characters. Whether they were parents, friends, enemies, or work addicted, it really showed throughout the movie. Not only was the acting pretrial phenomenal, but so were the visual effects! The scene when little Sophie is about to take her first steps really shows how much Holly and Eric care for her. They both want to be there every step of the way for her since her parents can't be. If that means putting everything they had before this ""new"" life behind them in order for her to be there for Sophie, they will. That scene really sets the mood and feeling of the new ""family"".

The main theme of the film is most definitely survival through loads of struggles. The fact that your two very best friends dies in a car crash is hard, but now, in addition to their death, you have been chosen to be their child's godparents is even tougher. On top of all of that, you have to do it with the person you despise the most! Although life throws hardships at you, we learn that you can't let that bring you down. You have to make the best out of this. If life gives you lemons, then make lemonade!",1326240000,3,2229,4.609571788413098

Josh Duhamel is okay for a leading man, but there was just no chemistry there at all between the two.  Overall, a pretty blah movie.",1319241600,2,460,4.428571428571429
4388726,5,B004ISM6E8,"If you read the professional write up, you know that Heigl and Duhamel are the best friends of a couple who die in an accident that leaves their baby girl orphaned, and because Heigl and Duhamel are the godparents, they are given the option of stepping up and taking on the role of parents to this adorable little girl.

Because the godparents were set up on a blind date by their best friends before the best friends were married and that blind date was an unmitigated disaster that left both of them with a dislike of the other, you know that there is going to be a rocky period of adjustment when they take on the duty of guardianship of the baby, Sophie.

However, despite the fact that this movie follows a rather predictable formula to start with, it is the way Heigl and Duhamel create their characters that makes this so much better than you expect it to be.

Sure, you have two very good looking single people coming together in a gorgeous house to raise an adorable baby, the movie practically writes itself, but it's the way you identify with both main characters, feel their frustrations, their uncertainties and their loss that makes this a much better than the average romantic comedy offering.

While you do have the satisfying ending that you want (and I really doubt that I needed to put in a spoiler alert about that) the way you get to to that satisfying ending isn't how you would expect to get there, the journey has some surprising twists and turns, and instead of being ridiculous vignettes, they are far more realistic and plausible struggles that these two go through as they try to balance what is best for them as individuals with what is best for the baby they love and their best friends who trusted them with what is a sacred undertaking.

I really enjoyed this movie for it's funny moments as well as the heartfelt emotional scenes that struck a chord of legitimacy for me.

Bakery owner and chef Holly (Katherine Heigl)  and news broadcaster Eric (Josh Duhamel) are set up on a blind date by their friends, Peter (Hayes MacArthur) and Alison (Chrisyina Hendricks) who are married. Holly and Eric are individually Peter's and Alison's best friends and become the godparents of their newborn child when she arrives.  Peter and Allison are killed in an accident  and the distraught Holy and Eric put differences aside when they discover that they have been named guardians for the now orphaned Sophie. In order to facilitate their needs to be both compassionate guardians and still maintain their separate careers they  move into Peter and Alison's house to honor their obligation to their best friends.  Child rearing is foreign to both of them - here the movie gets a bit over the edge with potty humor - and how the tow disparate people come to terms is the gist of the film.

Greg Berlanti directs, Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson have provided the script.  The acting is a step above what Heigl and Duhamel have given us before and there are some fine supporting roles by Josh Lucas, Kumail Nanjiani, etc. This is an entertaining movie and does explore the significance of friendship at times of crises.

This movie entertains well with this as the back drop.

I did not like the drug reference but it was brief, there was only one mouthed profanity that I recall and sexual references and a couple actual brief bed scenes.

While the acting isn't award winning, the main characters were expressive and believable in my opinion and the assortment of supporting cast gives fun relief to make an overall enjoyable movie.

I rented this movie and I would not mind owning it. If I had watched it in theatre I would have felt it was worth my time and money.

The pro-drug message was bad, when the godparents found drugs in the parent's house (after they passed). It was horrid the second time they pushed the message, as this couple, who ""love"" this baby, consume the drugs and then play parenting. Of course (as most movies and TV shows must do these days) there is the standard poster-""parent"" couple sitting in as their friends and are shown to be the model parents. All the other parents in this movie are, of course, out of it. ahem

So we try to overlook this agenda-driven movie and try to enjoy it. We couldn't! It was dumb and boring! It would have had a great ending, at least, if it had the new mom deciding to grow up for real and stay with a stable MAN (the pediatrician), rather than the little teen boy in a man's body. I don't think it would have reflected real life though, if it had, as she would have had to be a WOMAN in a woman's body, rather than the teen girl she was.

Can we talk about the baby?  For an entire year the kid doesn't get any older.  Oh, they have her going through the motions of learning to walk and talk, but it's the same exact baby throughout the movie.  Then they go from autumn to winter and bam!  She advances at least a year!

They are very real and believable, and do a great job of integrating humor in the midst of a difficult and tragic situation.  However, I was disappointed that the movie included scenes involving the use of illegal drugs.  At the beginning of the movie, when the baby's real parents are still alive, the baby's father discovers that the young guys who are delivering the bouncy castle for the baby's birthday party are stoned.  He scolds them and says he won't call the police if they turn over their pot to him.  He gets the bag of pot and, after the delivery guys walk away, he tells his friend (Messer) that he and his wife still do drugs once or twice a year.  Later on in the movie (after their friends die and they are living in their friend's house), Holly and Messer make brownies with that bag of pot, eat the brownies and get stoned.  This happens right on the heels of them being intimate and realizing that they love each other.  The writers could have easily made that time more meaningful --- and they should have made it more meaningful, especially since they were trying to establish that Messer's relationship with Holly was different than the shallow relationships he'd previously experienced with other women.  Instead, Holly and Messer numb their minds and laugh while watching the Wiggles.  Such a disappointment.  The bottom line:  while there are some good scenes in this movie that make it worth watching, it's not a movie you should watch with your child (or teen) because it puts drug use in a positive light.",1305504000,2,1638,4.708771929824562

4388762,4,B004ISM6E8,"I wasn't all that excited about this film.  It just seemed to me to be one of those generic rom/coms that live in that little world where polar opposites attract in ginormous ways; you know, the films that repeat the same running jokes from start to finish.  And then, you have that uncomfortable `let's try and make this dramatic' moment where something terrible happens and then they try and fit in the `funny'.  Throw on top of that the fact that neither Josh Duhamel nor Katherine Heigl have truly caught my attention in the past; both of them failing to bring the charisma they are expected to have to a film.

In other words; I expected a disaster here.

Instead, I got a rather surprising film that actually understood the balancing act between funny, charming and honest.  Sure, Josh and Katherine don't really bring anything dynamic to the table, and Josh in particular can ring rather dullish, but together they found a certain spark that, with the aid of some deftly layered direction, was able to latch on to the audience quite nicely.

The film tells the `unlikely' story of two individuals who share the same friends but openly loathe one another.  Holly is a prude and a serious, independent business woman and Messer is a suave playboy who prides himself in sports and `tail'.  The opening sequences of the film show the two set up on a blind date by their mutual `couple' friends only to never make it to the restaurant thanks to their polar opposite personalities.  Then we see snippets of their life as they `share' their friends and become central forces in the upbringing of their daughter, Sophie.  Then tragedy strikes in the form of a car accident that claims the couple's lives.  Thankfully, Sophie was not in the car, but now Holly and Messer are faced with a dilemma.  Sophie's parents have named BOTH of them her guardians in the unlikely event that they both die.

How can two people who hate one another raise a baby together?

So, the story is certainly the furthest thing from believable, but it all works somehow.  In fact, it really works.  Sure, some of the jokes can be grating (the endless barrage of `Josh Duhamel is hot' jokes become tiresome mainly because he's not THAT attractive and he lacks any real charm) and some of the clich&eacute;s are unnecessary (the neighborhood `help' seems too formulaic to be read as honest) but the parts that really matter, like the relationship shifts between Holly and Messer, actually work.  You believe their relationship in all of its stages, and even though you could probably guess the ending, the way that the film is constructed makes you doubt it till the very end, which is a refreshing `sleight of hand'.  Honestly, real kudos needs to be given to the film's director, Greg Berlanti, for he really understood how to take something comedic, add in tonal shifts that read genuine (the tears will come) but never forsaking his real goal here, which is to charm your hearts.

4388766,4,B004ISM6E8,"I enjoyed ""Life As We Know It"" immensely because I thought the protagonists portrayed the confusion and fear of sudden parenthood and sudden very altered relationship, from animosity to cooperation, convincingly.  It seemed realistic about a tragic, unlikely, the one you hope never happens to you, situation.  So there were poop jokes:  that's what babies do and to a non-parent suddenly changing an over-filled diaper, that can be a shock.  That Hollie is so uptight while Messer so easy-going is totally believeable, it could have been the other way around, and brings fine tension to the story.  One thing that is never doubted and a value I think propels the plotline is that Sophie is loved and treasured.  In this respect, the realism of helpful neighbors, swear words on occasion and the need for support or to escape through alcohol or a few loaded brownies is within the realm of the film's overall tone and story.

I am always eager to find a new movie to fall in love with...and this movie surprised me. I was skeptical as to whether or not it would be a hit or a miss (let's face it, Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"" was not good...), but with the right writing, the right cast, and the right on-screen chemistry, this movie was great! We all know that some people are good together and some people are just terrible together. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have great chemistry together on-screen. Watching their characters blossom throughout the story as individuals and *SPOILER ALERT* as a couple and as impromptu parents was amazing. I laughed, I cried, I loved this movie. Like any good dramedy, we watched the characters make both wise and foolish decisions and their outcomes, only to have them realize what they needed to do to be happy. I certainly appreciated that the movie was not overly sex-filled, nor too much cursing, the one instance of the ""F-WORD"" was whispered during an argument, not near the child. (While I am not a fan of swearing or any sort of vulgarity, I can tolerate it for the sake of a good story)

I loved the neighbors (not that I would ever really want my neighbors to be like that (ogling my man, etc....) but they certainly had their cute and charming moments.) and their respect of Holly (Heigl) and Messer (Duhamel) being the guardians/parents of their best friends' child.

Fyi, the casting of this movie was GREAT! I liked that the characters were allowed to make mistakes, and realize their problems and later on, try to change their mistakes or improve upon them.

While stereotypes, the neighbors are funny.  Heigl is an excellent actress and shows a great range of emotions throughout the movie.  Great pace and editing.

4388779,2,B004ISM6E8,"Once in a while you see a trailer for a movie that makes you think ""hey this could be funny"" only to discover afterwards that the best moments were all on display in that 3 minute trailer. Its sad when that happens, especially when the premise is a good one. I remember watching the trailer for LIFE AS WE KNOW IT and thinking it had potential. Katherine Heigl has starred on TV's GREY'S ANATOMY and KNOCKED UP. Josh Duhamel was in TRANSFORMERS and the TV show LAS VEGAS. These are two attractive stars in a romantic comedy so what could go wrong? Unfortunately several things.

The story revolves around Holly Berenson (Heigl) and Eric Messer (Duhamel). Originally set up on a blind date that goes terribly wrong in mere minutes, the two see each other in passing when invited to their best friends family events. Each is so close to one or the other that their friends make them godparents of their daughter Sophie. Then tragedy occurs when the unthinkable happens. Their friends die in a car accident and suddenly Holly and Messer find themselves the custodian of Sophie. Unfortunately their friends never gave any details to either of them about this plan.

Now Holly and Messer find themselves in unknown territory. To begin with neither of them knows anything about raising a child.
They also discover that there are no family members who can take care of young Sophie with any caring. One cousin has nine children of his own to worry about and Sophie's grandfather takes his oxygen with him as well as being able to do not much of anything.

Then there's their careers to think of. Holly is in the early stages of a successful bakery/catering business about to add a restaurant to her building. Messer is a television technician who works the board for local sports events in Atlanta. But the two of them work out schedules on a board and do their best, both deeply caring about Sophie and what is good for her.

But the best laid plans have a tendency to find problems. Toss into the mix a gaggle of neighbors who seem to be in the know on most everything and flirtatious with Messer as well as a social worker who must approve of the pair with several surprise visits and the recipe for disaster is just around the corner.

The standard problems arrive in the form of typical TV sitcom fashion. Poop jokes are plentiful and jealousy develops between the two although they're not the least bit romantically involved. Messer brings in one date after another and Holly seems to have found a love interest in Sophie's pediatrician Sam (Josh Lucas), a man she's seen at her bakery before. Even though they have their separate lives, you can still see the glimmer of a chance for them to get together eventually. Okay, so maybe the glimmer isn't quite there but the standard script obviously calls for it and you know its coming. Even the eventual possible parting of the ways is pretty pat when you think about it.

Perhaps that's what makes this movie fail more than succeed. You feel as if you've seen it before. Nothing seems fresh or new, as a matter of fact it feels forced throughout. And the two characters are so one sided. Holly is presented as a woman who wants to do what's right but always seems to be walked on by men in her life. And Messer is such an insufferable jerk from beginning to end that there is no hope for redemption before the final reel rolls. You can't watch a man be a jerk For 100 minutes and believe that in the last 14 he can suddenly become a caring, selfless individual. Those moments that should have come throughout the film (and sooner than near the end) would have made him a character you could care about. As a man even I wanted to see him hurt.

The movie is total fluff, lighter than marshmallow cream. The only good thing one can say about it is that both lead actors here do a great job and are both easy on the eye. Sadly both actors are also in a downward spiral when it comes to movies like this. Heigl has had several romantic comedies tank at the box office and Duhamel's last WHEN IN ROME tanked as well. One can only hope that both of them can find the perfect vehicle to resurrect their careers before movies like this one turn them into actors that folks will one day say ""Oh yeah, I think I remember them"". Both are far better than this movie would lead you to believe.",1299715200,4,4328,4.4847715736040605

Sharing the same house and suddenly having to raise a baby, having no experience with either situation, proves to be complicated, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking for the unlikely duo. Naturally, conflicts arise during the course of events, and it seems likely to fall apart---at least for a while.

I was expecting a romantic comedy but in the end I got neither. I can't say it was romantic because I saw no chemistry what so ever between the two main characters. You would expect they would but no fire. And I only got a handful of chuckles none that would want me to watch over and over again, like in so many other romantic comedies I've watched in the past. The whole thing was very uncomfortable to watch. I mean I went to the movie theater and I could hear crunching off the popcorn when something was meant to be funny.

The trailer told the story in one nut shell. Two people who hate each other, raise the baby together, and eventually fall in love. I was ready for this movie to end. But then again I paid ten dollars to go see it, so I had to finish watching it. I mean I expected the film to medicore but things shock me, like Love and Other drugs it shocked me. I'd recommend the movie.

Not really much of a spoiler but theres a part in the movie that so cliche I shook my head while watching it. Katherine H. character goes to the airport to catch Josh D. character before he gets on the plane.

To sum it up if you don't take my advice by not seeing it. If you do decide make sure you watch it for free or for two dollars at some movie that's still playing it.

4388788,4,B004ISM6E8,"LIFE AS WE KNOW IT manipulates you like a marionette, tugs at your heartstrings, tries to melt your heart with a bombardment of cute baby. It gets away with it because of the two good leads and because the screenplay draws a nice balance between comedy and melodrama, and because the baby really is freakin' adorable. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT has Katherine Heigl once again playing one of those fussy, career-oriented, yet vulnerable roles she so excels in. This time her character is Holly Berensen, an up-and-coming caterer. Josh Duhamel stretches his range from playing G.I. Joe on TRANSFORMERS to a fun-loving, laid back network sports director named Eric Messer (but no one calls him ""Eric""). The story kicks off with Holly and Messer set up on a blind date by mutual friends, and the date is a horrible, utter disaster. A colossal dating no-no: arranging for a booty call later that night when your current date is in the same car with you. Holly and Messer quickly part company, quite disenchanted.

So imagine their alarm when those same friends who set them up die in a car accident and Holly and Eric find themselves the legal guardians of a suddenly orphaned baby girl named Sophie. Can these two very different souls put aside their mutual dislike and their warring agendas to make a home for Sophie? Well, no, they really can't. They adore the kid. But they can't stand each other. In the parlance of cinema, there's no better recipe for romance.

For the common denominator crowd, there are the baby poopy gags and the smoking the extracurricular stuff. We get the expected hijinks revolving around our couple's attempts to juggle careers and social obligations with their parenting of Sophie. Except that the screenplay delivers enough depth and serious moments to offset the silly. It restrains itself enough. To be honest, there's nothing here that you haven't seen before. But the performances carry you through. Heigl and Duhamel work really well together. The inevitable love story pays off when it suprisingly takes an honest, emotional turn down the road. And you have to appreciate the neat little touches brought about by a supporting cast which features odd neighbors, a teen (pre-teen?) baby whisperer, and a social worker who develops a case of slow burn hysterics. Josh Lucas also shows up as a hunky pediatrician, not that anyone feels threatened. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT is a romantic comedy as we know it. And, I guess, sometimes, there's comfort in familiarity, if the execution is right, if the two leads are compatible, if the baby is all kinds of huggable.

As far as the film goes, it was not one of the better films of late. Katherine Heigl was her usual bitchy self as in previous films. I wonder from her screen portrayals if she is actually like this in real life. From all accounts on entertainment web sites and magazines, she definiely has the diva attitude. Josh Duhamel look's as good as ever and tries hard to play opposite his counterpart Heigl. Honestly, if I was him, I would have kicked her to the curb immediately.

The funny parts are all in relation the baby, the usual barfing in the face, pooping in the guys favorite ball cap, etc...

For the ladies out there, there is plenty of tear jerker stuff like, the friends dying, Josh leaving the family to take a job out of state, Josh comming back and realizing how much he loves her and the baby. I also though it was funny when the social worker ""just happened"" to show up when they had cooked ""special"" brownies.

Well, this movie.

Sorry I can't go deeper than that. I liked it; I'd watch it again. It's Katherine Heigl-- everything she does is entertaining, and she's adorable, and way talented. It's a rom-com; we don't watch them to ponder deep mysteries of existence-- at least I don't. It's an escape for a few.

Having said that, I also want to add that the arguments between the two seemed more real/less staged than I've seen before in other movies; almost felt like I was eavesdropping in a few spots. But I blinked, and he had gone from womanizer to a man in love in about the time it takes to sneeze. And then they all lived happily ever after.

Heigl is adorable and great as always, with exception of the killers, which was pretty lame. She brings beauty, emotion, comedy and similarity to the film. You understand she wanted a child and family but not the way she got it. Duhamel is the typical just wanna get laid guy in the movie until he realizes he's got something special, a beautiful women who cares about him and a adorable goddaughter that is technically his daughter, at home. Overall I'd say 8/10. Good movie, not all chick flick either, I enjoyed.

I have over 200 Blu-Ray's in my library and this Blu-Ray picture is grainy, the DVD actually looks better than the Blu-Ray playing through my PS3 on my 46"" 240 Mhz HDTV.

After the worst blind date ever Holly & Eric (Heigl & Duhamel) are forced to still see each other through thier mutual friends.  After a car accident leaves thier friend's baby in thier care Holly & Eric are left to work together to raise her right.  Watching two single adults who have never thought about marriage or kids figure out what to do is very entertaining. The subject matter is very difficult to make into a comedy, but the writers found a way to make it work.  There are definatly dramatic parts but overall it is a very funny and touching movie.  In terms of romantic comedies this is a little on the girlie end but I did enjoy it and laughed throughout.  The one downside is that it is very predictable.  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - Yes I would",1297123200,5,874,4.319018404907975
4388803,4,B004ISM6E8,"This movie has received more than its fair share of bad press.  I went and saw this movie when it was in my local theater last summer.  I think the major reason people are giving it bad reviews is that they are expecting the whole movie to consist of a mismatched couples attempt to raise a child to yield roll on the floor laughing moments.  However, to truely understand this film, you have to look deep for the hidden meaning.  I found that when you discover that the movie truly revolves around a child who's parents are killed and is left to be raised by two different people who really didn't want to be together, much less raise a child together, then you get the true spirit of the film.  Once you understand this point of view you will truly enjoy this film for what it is, a coming of age story.",1297036800,27,805,4.269736842105263
4388804,5,B004ISM6E8,"When a couple of friends decided we were going to go see this I was skeptical. I love Katherine Heigl, but the premise of this film seemed just overused, and obvious. When I walked out of the film I had a completely different opinion. Yes the ending was obvious, but how the characters got from point A to point B was not. It was an enjoyable film, that hit on some real human aspects. Definitely worth the time, and money. I will be buying the DVD.",1293321600,5,449,4.232558139534884
4388805,2,B004ISM6E8,"When you can see comedies as sharply written and hilariously executed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modern-Family/dp/B002JVWQSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modern Family</a>&nbsp;on network TV for free, it becomes exponentially more frustrating to see a studio-manufactured rom-com as flatly developed as this 2010 programmer. Moreover, it would be hard to find a more contrived and tenuous premise than the one presented by director Greg Berlanti (2000's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Broken-Hearts-Club/dp/B0000560PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Broken Hearts Club</a>&nbsp;is his last movie) and first-time screenwriters Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson. The story revolves around a tragedy, the sudden auto-related deaths of a young couple, who decides to leave their baby daughter Sophie to their mutual best friends, uptight bakery owner Holly Berenson and laid-back pro basketball telecaster Eric Messer, both of whom are conveniently single. The second teaser is that Holly and Eric have conveniently hated each other ever since a really bad blind date (which serves as the film's prologue).

The third incredible aspect of the story is that the deceased couple never told Holly and Messer that they had been appointed the baby's legal guardians, and the fourth contrivance is that they must live together in their friends' upscale Atlanta home, although the mortgage has thoughtfully been covered for a year by the deceased couple. From this precarious, stacked-deck set-up emerges a formulaic, opposites-attract story as Holly and Messer get accustomed to bringing up baby together, with all the predictable, sitcom-level sight gags and poop jokes one expects from such derivative drivel. The inevitable complications ensue when Holly starts getting serious about Sophie's idealized pediatrician, while Messer remained ensconced in the Peter Pan syndrome. In typical by-the-numbers fashion, the plot resolution is never in question from the outset.

As appealing an actress as she can be (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>), Katherine Heigl, who also serves as the film's executive producer, has become exceedingly repetitive with her screen roles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/27-Dresses/dp/B0015I2RT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">27 Dresses</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ugly-Truth/dp/B002P413IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ugly Truth</a>), and her Holly is really no exception save the scene where she faces the story's tragic pivot point.

4388806,5,B004ISM6E8,"At first I watched it because of the casts. But as the movie flows, I really think it has some depths in it. Not just some other romantic/comedy, this one we can actually relate to (and finally for once no sexual context, well just a little maybe. Which I find it refreshing). How new parents are behaving and adapt with their first child, is sometimes funny to watch but also heartfelt. Overall, this movie has some laughs, tears, and of course love.

4388807,2,B004ISM6E8,"I laughed while watching ""Life as We Know It"", the newest Kathryn Heigl vehicle. Heigl has a unique sort of movie star look and evokes memories of some of the stars of the 50s and 60s. In fact, ""Life"" seems like a movie Doris Day might have made. I am not a huge fan of Doris Day's films.

But after watching this film, I became depressed. ""Life"" is a forthy, frivolous little confection but it is also a film you will instantly forget. I find it a little sad when people make one film after another, films that do nothing to challenge their skills or showcase their talents.

Holly (Kathryn Heigl) owns a small bakery in Atlanta. Her friends fix her up on a blind date with Messer (Josh Duhamel), an editor of live sports telecasts. They are completely wrong for each other and don't get along at all. In fact, they instantly hate each other. Their friends, Allison and Peter (Christina Hendricks, TV's ""Mad Men"" and Hayes MacArthur) have a baby, Sophie, and name Holly and Messer as the baby's god-parents. This forces Holly and Messer to spend time with one another at Sophie's birthday parties (Holly is a baker and brings elaborate cakes) and other family events One night, Holly gets a phone call and learns her two friends were killed in a car accident. She and Messer soon learn they are the designated guardians and reluctantly try to raise Sophie, based on their friend's last wishes.

In reading this synopsis, you can probably guess just about every ""twist and turn"", if such obvious moments can be labeled as such. This is always a problem in my eyes. Yes, the familiar is welcome in some circumstances, but while watching a film or television show, familiarity usually leads to boredom.

There are some funny moments and some funny observations, but they seem too forced, too sitcomy and too few and far between. The film is directed by Greg Berlanti, who comes from television. He is currently one of the producers of the new television series ""No Ordinary Family"", which is better than this film. When someone comes from a television background, you hope they will use the opportunity to make a film to push for something different and better, something more challenging. But ""Life"" plays like a sitcom or dramedy. When Messer is faced with a problem, he is saddled with Sophie when he has an opportunity to direct his first sports broadcast, his solution plays out like something you would see on CBS on Monday night. It is not necessarily something you want to pay $11 or more to experience in a theater.

I have seen a number of Kathryn Heigl's films and I have always laughed at her performances. Given the fact she and her mother serve as Executive Producer on her films, she is clearly trying to model her career after the comedy stars of yesteryear. She seems to want to be the next Katharine Hepburn or the next Rosalind Russell. Is she as good as either of these classic actresses? No way, but she holds some promise.

What I find disappointing is that her films are so mediocre. This seems to be the result of everyone associated with the films; the studio okaying the film, the writer(s) who provide the predictable 'madcap"" story, the director who can't make the film something new and interesting. But most importantly, the fault lies with Heigl herself. If, as Executive Producer, she doesn't push the people working on the project to produce something interesting, who will? I still think she holds promise, I am still waiting for a truly memorable film role, but I won't be waiting for much longer.

Josh Duhamel is also extremely likable but he also hasn't delivered on the promise many believe he has shown. A former soap actor (""All My Children""), he then starred on ""Las Vegas"" leading to a role in a surprisingly good romantic comedy called ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"". The ""Transformers"" films follow, one good and one bad. Maybe the third will be the charm. But it is difficult for him to stand out amid all of the cacophony and destruction of these mega-budget films. His last few films have been disappointing. In ""Life"", Messer is a mess and he doesn't realize it. But you know that over the course of the film, he will learn what is important in life and he will become a better person. This doesn't come as a surprise does it?

Josh Lucas, also once a promising actor who is extremely charismatic, plays the guy Holly is interested in and attracted to. He is completely the opposite of Messer, a successful pediatrician who does everything possible to woo the caf&eacute; owner, he doesn't stand a chance. What happened to his career? Wow! He is now relegated to playing the guy Kathryn Heigl doesn't want or end up with?

And when you see one film after another in which people just don't move forward, that is truly depressing. And forgettable. What was the name of that other Kathryn Heigl film? Kathryn who?

I don't know about you, but I don't like to pay $11 or more to become depressed.",1287619200,12,4940,4.64187643020595
4388808,4,B004ISM6E8,"Hollie and Messer, set-up by best friends Allison and Peter, meet, share a disaster of a non-date and develop an intense hatred for each other. Then Allison and Peter get married and have a baby, forcing Hollie and Messer to be subjected to each other often. Glimpses of Hollie and Messer and their interaction flash on the screen as this relationship that ties them together unfolds. Finally, a laughing moment is shared at Baby Sophie's 1st birthday party where a picture is taken with ""Godparents,"" Hollie and Messer, who don't understand exactly what that term means.

Fast forward several weeks and Hollie and Messer meet up at the police station to discover that Allison and Peter have died in a horrific accident and that Sophie needs them. They discover how much as the rest of the story unfolds.

I really liked this film. I watched it with four friends and we all agreed that it was worth the investment. The main characters are three-dimensional and well-cast. Though not laugh out-loud funny in most scenes, there is enough humor thrown in to make the subject matter less intense. Not pure comedy, or drama, also not pure chick flick. Enough deep issues and emotions play out that the movie grabbed my emotions and heart.

A few cheesy moments make their way into the movie...one in particular is a drug thread that ends up falling flat, though it likely supposed to play as a light-hearted moment. There are a group of neighbors that add annoyingly funny moments throughout the film. Language is minimal, the F-Bomb makes few appearances, the most memorable is a whispered fight. Messer is a new-girl-a-night kind of a guy so there are plenty of comments about his tom-catting ways, though the sex scenes are minimal and primarily off-screen. Hollie is an uptight business owner who's rigidity makes for a few annoying minutes throughout the film as well. But overall the relationship between them ends up being respectful of families and love and this one will end up in my DVD library.",1286668800,134,2000,4.842105263157895
