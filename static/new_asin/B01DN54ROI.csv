7719805,4,B01DN54ROI,"This one was more about Kabuto's back story than the current battle for the ninja world.
It has it high points but it is mostly Kabuto history.
But it did kick off Sauska inquiry about what is a village and clan.
If you don't know what I am talking about read the manga, it might make sense later on.",1472688000,,300,4.101694915254237
7719806,4,B01DN54ROI,"As always, great quality.  If I had any gripes, it would be to wish there was an option to buy with just Japanese audio and English subtitles.  No offense to the actors, but dubbed version of anything (movies, anime, etc) always seem...dorky.  But, that's just me as I always prefer to watch a production in it's native language (ever tried watching Lethal  Weapon in French or Spanish or Le Pacte de loups in English?).  This would also give the added bonus of faster releases as I've heard fansubbers can release with the same quality production in the same week the anime airs in Japan.  This would save cost and time (three~four months-ish).  Otherwise, if this is the best way to get to watch such a great show as Naruto, it is what it is.",1472342400,,744,4.507462686567164

7719815,5,B01DN54ROI,Naruto can do no wrong in my book. Know the Shippuden is working to the end. Now sure how it ends but believe some stuff I saw on You Tube explains that. Think maybe 3 more sets should do it. Been following it all from the first Naruto to the Shippudens. Fight with Lord Pain the greatest ever.,1470009600,2,294,4.086206896551724

7719825,5,B01DN54ROI,"There is just so much going on here in these twelve episodes, it is just incredible. These episodes are very well written and they interconnect very well. I only wish to see it again in English and not speed read the subtitles. This way so I can understand the theories and concepts better.

So here we go; The first two episodes concentrate primarily on Kabuto and why he joined the hidden Leaf and the foundation. Seemed the Foundation had been secretly been funding these medical ninja's, who were a separate from the Leafs forces. The Foundation were going to blackmail these medical ninja's if they did not give up Kabuto; the Foundation saw Kabuto as a prodigy and wanted him badly and were going to cut off their funding to their group, among the other donations if they did not comply. Orochimaru took a particular interest and liking to Kabuto, and Kabuto felt the same way, marveling at his genius. Orochimaru leaves the Foundation and the Hidden Leaf to pursue his ambition  of creating Ninja's will extraordinary skills and takes Kabuto with him.

You will learn about Kabuto plan for Hatachi; But Hatachi and Sasuke decide, they will stop Kabuto reanimation Jitsu, knowing if they killed him it would not break the spell and how they both did it was amazing. Sure they fought Kabuto and the fight was mainly a sea saw, but eventually the two brothers break Jitsu and release the souls of the dead.

Now, you will come to a valid point why no one in the Uchiha clan cannot abuse the virtual Jitsu, (Izami). I cannot wait for this to be explained to me in English. Also you will learn why Hitachi destroyed the Uchiha clan, but spared his younger brother Sasuke.

So even though the five Kage are fighting the real Madarra and were out classed against fighting him, they come to realize that the dispelling of the reanimation Jitsu does not apply to the original Madarra and later on you will learn why. Their battle ends in one big surprise.

After Sasuke separates from Hitachi, you will learn how Orochimaru comes back to life, in a way I never imagined. I am not going to explain it here, you have to watch for it to believe it.

Toward the end of the box set you will be given a flash back history lesson of who the newer Madarra really is. How he came to be, how him and Kakashi  use to be best friends. The new Madarra actually sacrificed himself to save Kakashi from a avalanche. With his body half crushed, (the new Madarra) gave Kakashi a very valuable late birthday present, that if I told you what it was, you want to kill me. Madarra gave his late birthday present to Kakashi, because he thought he was a goner. But he lived, thanks to the old Madarra. You will learn how the new Madarra regenerated his crushed body and gained his abilities. The new Madarra took that name to confuse and surprise the Allied forces. He was hiding real identity. But Kakashi, Killer ""B"", Naruto and Guy Sensei sash his mask and the new Madarra is not identified.

The last episode shows how and why the new Madarra formed Akatatsuki, in which Pain was the first leader, until his death from a double cross from the hidden Rain and the Foundation. Even though the new Madarra controlled the Akatatsuki, he shared that authority with Nagato. Nagato was the field commander in the battles that were fought, controlling the forces of Akatatsuki. Pain was just a puppet he used, having the enemy thinking he was alive and well. But pain was killed by a double cross from the hidden Rain and the Foundation.

If I keep on going, I feel I will ruin the box set. So I hope this motivates people to buy the English version. I know I will get my copy as soon as it comes out.",1465862400,3,3672,4.5
