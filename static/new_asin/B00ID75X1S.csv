6258675,3,B00ID75X1S,"I ordered this because ""Laura"" is one of my favorite movies. I didn't get to see it in a theatre, as I was living in Europe when it came out, so missed it at the time it was playing here, but it was written by a good friend, Jay J.Drattler, who told me once he wrote himself into the villain of the piece... I can believe it, he could be a mean one (oh, not to me... he liked me). The other three films are kinda sappy love stories... and I do love Cary Grant, even in a silly film.",1490832000,5,482,3.83

6258692,5,B00ID75X1S,"This four pack of films from 20th Century Fox is a win-win all the way. Win for the price and a win for the quality of films presented.
An Affair to Remember(released July/57)stars,among others, Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant. The story finds Cary as a notorious playboy meeting Kerr who is in a lifeless marriage,on a ship bound for Europe. The two fall for each other,Cary more demonstratively than Kerr. Cary takes her to see his grandmother in the south of France which enhances Kerr's feelings for Cary. Back in NYC the two agree to end their relationships and meet each other on top of the Empire State Building in six months. Cary is there at the appointed hour but Kerr never shows,as unbeknownst to Cary she is struck by a car just below. Kerr undergoes operations and therapy to be able to walk again but remains in a wheelchair. She wants Cary never to know of her condition. Cary eventually finds her address and pays a visit, for some closure to her""snub"".In the end Cary realizes the truth and the two finally reunite properly. Leo McCarey directed this wonderful picture of two people finding their soulmates but going through hell to get there. It is  a fine print and is in a 2:35:1 a/r. 4 1/2-5 stars.
Laura(released Oct/44)stars Gene Tierney,Dana Andrews,Clifton Webb and Vincent Price,among others. This Academy Award winning picture is gripping from start to finish. Andrews is a detective called in to investigate a murder. After many interviews of suspects,friends and colleagues,Andrews sits in the victims apartment. Who should walk in but the murder victim herself(Tierney) ! There are plenty of suspects with motives but in the end it turns out to be one of Tierny's friends. And just who DID get bumped off? It still packs a punch even today. This film can safely be given the status of classic,it is that good. Well directed and acted,this is a not to be missed film in anyone's lives. It is in its original full screen a/r and is a clear print. 5 stars.
A Letter to Three Wives(released  Jan/49)stars,among others,Jeanne Crain,Linda Darnell,Ann Sothern,Kirk Douglas and Paul Douglas. The story finds Crain,Sothern and Darnell as three wives of varying backgrounds and husbands out volunteering as chauffeurs and assistants on a kids day out (picnic and boat ride) .A letter arrives from a female friend explaining that she has run away with one of their husbands but won't say who. As each lady thinks back into their past it is revealed all of the husbands know this women well and she has always seemed overly attentive to each,sending them timely gifts and socializing  over the years. The day comes to an end and each wife goes home. Darnell and Sothern  have their hubbies, so it is assumed Crain is the one left flat. But Crain's hubby told her he may or may not be home that day and,as it turns out, it is one of the other two who had the chance to go away but backed out. But which and why did they come home? Watch and see. Another wonderful picture,which has a more realistic feel to it in so far as their private lives are concerned. It is certainly a study in characters. The film slowly winds its way along to tell its full story and it manages to keep your interest. It is a clear print and is in its original full screen a/r. 4 stars.
Finally we have The Three Faces of Eve,released Sept/57. It stars,among others,Joanne Woodward,David Wayne and Lee J. Cobb. This is a tour de force performance from Woodward who won the best actress OSCAR.She plays a women with multiple personality disorder;three in fact. Based on a true story, Cobb plays her psychiatrist and Wayne is her bewildered hubby. She has apparently had the problem since a very young age but is forced to finally go to Cobb for help when it becomes out of control. As the story progresses, her different personalities come out;one a beaten-down and depressed mother,the other a flirtatious thrill seeker and the third a quite normal and gentle sounding women. In the end,after Cobb finally gets to the cause of her mental breakup,only one personality will win out for good. Wonderfully directed and acted by all,this is a mesmerizing film about mental illness and its effects not only on the patient but the other people that enter their lives. It is a clear print and is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1. 4 1/2-5 stars.
Each of these discs(there is one each for each film) come with a number of special features dedicated to that particular movie. They are the same discs that you would find if you bought them separately. For the price this an absolute steal getting such high quality films at such a low price as this. You would pay 4-5 or more times the price if bought separately. Get it while the getting's good.",1454457600,6,4725,4.668667466986795

6258696,5,B00ID75X1S,Some of my favorite romance movies. In a Letter to Three Wives you get three love stories and it keeps you guessing until the very end. Wonderful movie. Laura is a mystery that takes you through a woman's relationships up to her murder. Then there are more surprises. It is a romance/mystery as the detective becomes attracted to the victim as he tries to solve her murder.,1438560000,,373,4.582089552238806
6258697,5,B00ID75X1S,If you like classic love stories with out all the in your face sex of modern movies you will love An Affair to Remember and Laura with its just a little who done it is wonderful.

6258702,5,B00ID75X1S,"Fabulous movies for those who don't want all the ""in your face"" sex & foul language.  These were made when Hollywood Stars were really something special. Each one of these movies are well made.  One could only wish that Laura, A Letter to 3 wives and The 3 faces of Eve were done in color.  Another classic movie you may want to add to your collection is "" Mildred Pierce""  in which Joan Crawford won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.",1427068800,5,446,4.273809523809524
6258703,4,B00ID75X1S,"This set is well worth the price. The film quality and sound are both good, especially considering the age of these movies.

An Affair to Remember was my favorite of the four. Deborah Kerr is so good in this movie, looking oh so glamorous too, unlike many of her plain Jane roles that she is known for. I thought Cary Grant was a poor choice for this movie, he seemed to be sleep-walking to the end of this story. But still, well worth viewing.

Laura, in spite of the many rav reviews about this film, was not an attention-grabber for me. Too many parts of the story that didn't ring true, in particular the pristine ""crime scene"" . Dana Andrews was not good in this one either.

The Three Faces of Eve was a pivotal role for Joanne Woodward. A disturbing film to watch (and definitely NOT for children) but she was brilliant in her portrayal of Eve, a person who actually did exist. I didn't realize that previously that this story was based on fact.

Letter to Three Wives has it's moments. If you want to see Kirk Douglas at his oh so handsome best, this is a good film to watch. Jeanne Crain was also wonderful in this film. It's kind of quirky and lots of fun.

Overall, definitely worth the $$$",1423785600,5,1201,4.34375

6258705,5,B00ID75X1S,"I love the selection of movies in this DVD. I have watched ""Letter To Three Wives"" a hundred times, and enjoy it even more the next time. I love all the characters, and each person was perfect in their role. ""An Affair To Remember"" is a great movie, and very sad. I am so glad it had a happy ending. Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant  complimented each other, and actually seemed like they were head over heels for each other.  ""Laura"" was a great movie also, and kept me in suspense, and I was surprised several times. Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews  made a perfect match. The ending shocked me. I haven't watched ""Three Faces Of Eve"" yet. I saw it once before, but plan to watch it when I can watch it without interruptions.",1420761600,9,719,4.311111111111111
