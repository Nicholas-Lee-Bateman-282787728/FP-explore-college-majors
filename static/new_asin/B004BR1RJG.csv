8422206,4,B004BR1RJG,"I really enjoyed watching this.  I am currently restoring a '55 F100, so some of this helped a bit.  It did give me a few pointers on cleaning stainless steel pipes after welding, as well as some of the different vendors they used.  I was hoping this would go a bit more in-depth, but what it did cover was impressive.  If you can get it fairly cheap, it was an enjoyable watch.",1452729600,,378,4.208333333333333

8422208,4,B004BR1RJG,"I've seen the truck referenced many times on the show, but never got to see the complete build.  I took old school literally, and was a little disappointed in some of the choices that we're made, but overall, it was a good build and very instructive.  Thankfully, there are absolutely no commercials.  I'd say if you are at all interested or curious, buy the DVD.",1356393600,,363,4.553846153846154
8422209,5,B004BR1RJG,"VERY cool project build!!!  I remember when this build originally aired on Trucks! tv, but I was not able to keep up with it week after week.  They do a great job of editing the footage to only show the build so you don't have to sit and watch entire episodes.  Don't get me wrong though, there is still a TON of good quality footage.  This is a must have for any classic truck enthusiast, especially if you love mid-fifties Fords!  Although I have different ideas as I am currently building my '55, it's pretty cool to see a different perspective of how to restore our trucks.

On a side note, I've always liked host Kevin Tetz but hated his former co-host Paul Vinson with his raspy voice and his wannabe Stone Cold Steve Austin appearance.  Although you have to put up with him in the beginning of the project build, you get to witness the transition to Tetz's current (and MUCH better) co-host Ryan Shand.",1338076800,,909,4.4397590361445785
