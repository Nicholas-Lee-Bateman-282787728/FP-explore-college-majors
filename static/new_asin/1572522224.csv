189803,1,1572522224,"Why am I so harsh on this film? This 1993 effort is virtually a rip-off of the kind of highly stylized epics that characterized Akira Kurosawa's  films of the 1980's. Specifically it is too similar to the 1985 Ran in  terms of script, style, and even the costumes and sets.
Other than being  a totally inferior and embarrassing attempt to emulate the master, it is  also guilty of historical inaccuracy (if it's a  fantasy that why not go  all the way - why the pretentious tone of a historical epic which it is  not?!), exoticism (*all* the women in the film and even the men in the  brothel), glorification of violence (whose sensual beauty tries to gloss  over the very poor script) and terrible acting by all the performers.
The dialogue, to my native Chinese-speaking ears, are nothing short of  uncreative and hurriedly thrown-together hodge podge of ancient maxims  and  trite cliches any film trying to be original and substantial should avoid.  Sure, Joan Chen is a beautiful actress but even her star power or  any  artistic integrity she isn't going to help the script or the general  execution of this pathetic rip-off at all. Obviously a Chinese-Australian  production aimed at the international market, in the guise of a historical  Asian epic....ARRRRRRGH! Do yourself a favor and AVOID!",927331200,6,1302,4.894495412844036

7797768,5,1572522224,there is more here in the last twenty minutes than in the first hour. it is typically chinese in that the characters all seem to be wearing make up and all of the drama is exagerated to it's furthest degree. but it has a sublime undertone of buddhism and fits nicely into the taoist view of things too.,1402099200,,302,4.224137931034483
7797769,4,1572522224,"Rather than engage in the back and forth of these reviews, permit me to offer one slightly different observation.

When the abbot monk is asked how he lived to be over 100, he said ""I eat at the time to eat, and sleep at the time to sleep.""

Later, a woman had appeared and requested to become a nun. The hero, a former warlord  who was hiding from his past, shaved her head, and in doing so, became aroused.

One night, she crept into his bed chamber and said ""You are not a monk"". She mentioned the way he carressed her when he shaved her head, his strong shoulders, etc. Inevitabley, nature took its course. After they tickled each other's fancy, she gently and seductively tied his wrists with a piece of leather, stradled him, and introduced herself as the widow of another warlord whom he had killed. She then started biting him on the jugular vein. Our hero struggled to be free, to no avail.

Suddenly, the old monk appeared out of nowhere, did some kind fo kung fu move with his walking stick, and killed the woman by striking her at the base of her skull. Our hero lay there, amazed and shocked. The old monk shook his head and walked away, muttering ""No sleep at the time to sleep.""

Let's be honest; could an American have come up with this?",1232150400,9,1253,4.356223175965665
7797770,5,1572522224,"""Temptation of a Monk"" is one title in my prized collections, along
with ""Brazil"", ""Das Boot"", ""Fisher King"", and ""Wallace and Grommet""...

The movie takes us on a transformational journey with the protagonist General. Though he commands the fate of hundreds of thousands of people, and even the fate of nations, he was caught helplessly in a turmoil caused by royal sibling rivlary, where the prize of wrong alliance is death.  After the coup, his subordinate saught the General's death to avenge the betrayed, now dead prince.  His mother then denouced his failure to protect the dead prince, and thus tarnished the family reputation as loyal subjects.  She expressed her denouncement through suicide, which the General witnessed. He soon became a fugitive general pursued by the newly enthroned king because he failed to submit to the new king.

In his fugitive runs, the general slid down a slipery slope of decadence, conveyed through brothel indulgence.  He tried to run from one crisis to the next, but confronted death of people around him wherever he turned.  He struggled with all his might, but to no avail in his salvation.

In his last ditch escape, he saught refuge in a desolate monistery where the essence of life was revealed in simple words by an unassuming monk in ragged cloths, with unshaven head. The General calms and attains peace as his internal conflicts are resolved through seemingly mondane day to day interactions with the Zen master.

The thematic development is brilliant, where the chaotic conflicts between
multiple interests and constant tensions are released anti-climatically at the end.  Taking their place are seemingly casual conversations woven into daily life, whose wisdom brought the past turmoil into proper perspective and closure.  The simple yet profound messages, often subtly hillarious, are as relevant to modern hectic life style as ever.

Don't take my word for it. See it for yourself.
Many may be disappointed, but may you be the few who find jewels in this classic.",1214352000,3,2021,5.090909090909091
7797771,5,1572522224,This was a highly underrated film.. probably best appreciated along it's themes of buddhism and eroticism and it's backdrop of tang dynasty china,1204848000,3,145,5.3478260869565215
7797772,5,1572522224,"Foreign films are soooo.... Foreign. And TOAM is not an exception. Do to the many excellent reviews already given the story has already been given away several times-so I won't feel bad if my contribution gives away the story some more. This movie is a buddhist love story. There is Violet the 19th princess who has this eccentric relationship with the hero. However, she dies. Many are tricked into thinking she returns later as the dead general's wife. Her purpose is to Tempt the monk with SEX which she does well. It's in the final scene that Violet makes her reappearance as the pony that the monk rides off on (into the sunset :) satisfying her destiny to be his companion while complementing his monkhood which she was unable to do after his conversion. Recall that the Monk was a general much given to womanizing and gaming hence he had no use for such a fierce knife. It is obvious in the scene where violet encounters the hunting generals that a relationship already existed between the Tang-y princess and the jovial general ;)

The complexity of this movie becomes evident after about the 19th viewing - This is a great movie.",1134432000,2,1138,4.661691542288557
7797773,2,1572522224,"Hong Kong director Clara Law's film is based on a novel by Lillian Lee, who also wrote Farewell My Concubine. Set in China's Tang dynasty, it concerns the antagonism between two generals, Shi (Wu Hsin-Kuo) and Huo Da (Zhang Fengyi) who plot to overthrow the Emperor. Shi retreats from the fight when the ascendant heir is killed and seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery. Law lacks the narrative skill to elucidate the story, relying instead on random set pieces, which occasionally redeem her painfully slow pace. The stylised use of colour and choreography in the opening ceremony and in an extended brothel sequence are very lovely, and she out-Peckinpah's Peckinpah in savage slow-motion massacres. Law has a good eye for composition, favouring the use of wind and smoke in her exteriors, and the burning of a house near the end is very beautiful. The brothel sequence features a transvestite, and the sex scene between Shi and a nun is all the more erotic because their shaved heads give it a particular subtext. Of the actors, Joan Chen manages to connect with the audience, though her screen time is limited, and the abbott monk raises a few laughs.",992736000,4,1155,4.868020304568528
7797774,4,1572522224,"this movie has got to be one of the greatest stories of all times, if you can understand it. you need to understand the asian culture in order to truly grasp what's going on as joan chen acts two roles. it has no  relevance on the story, it's just this woman trying to kill the hero-the  19th princess is already dead. it is the monk being tempted which is  obviously the core of the movie-where our hero has forsaken revenge for  introspection. it is only after he is pushed to the furthest point of  endurance where he fights back, and even then unwillingly. it is this  self-control that most US viewers have a hard time comprehending, but one  sees that the hero's opponent's lack of self-control is what makes him lose  in the end, a modern fable this is",958953600,4,759,4.410071942446043
7797775,2,1572522224,"Temptations starts off well, but it gets confusing when Joan Chen's character Scarlet is killed.  Then, later on, when our hero takes refuge in a Buddhist monastary, Joan Chen shows up again as Violet.  Was she supposed  to be Scarlet's twin sister, or what?  The sex scene in the monastery, in  which Chen and the protagonist are bald from having shaved their heads, is  pretty erotic, but apart from that, there is no reason to see this movie at  all.",958089600,3,453,4.5875
7797776,2,1572522224,"First let me say that I like this film.  It's beautiful with a intriguing story.
With that out of the way let me again point out that Fox/Lorber has again put out a poor DVD edition of another film.  The subtitles are on  the film and very big.  I guess I shouldn't complain as you can read them,  unlike most of Fox/Lorber films.
This is in Full Screen.  I wish  someone could explain to me how Fox/Lorber can call their movies widescreen  with they are full frame?  Someone should call them on this fact as they  repeatedly call their movies widescreen that are obviously full screen.
The video is decent as is the audio.  All I can say is that it's  watchable and doesn't take too much away from the original.  But again it's  just a poor transfer.
Oh well...if you are like me and really want to  see this film it is probably the only version that will come out.  But if  not...there are plenty of Criterion and Anchor Bay DVDs to mention a  couple.",947548800,7,953,4.318181818181818
