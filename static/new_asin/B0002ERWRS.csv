2082199,5,B0002ERWRS,Touching and bitter sweet story of three friends who come to America for fame and fortune but find pain and poverty. Should be given to every person to watch BEFORE they cross the boarders. Seemed a bit short but nicely and well done.,1176163200,4,234,4.465116279069767
2082200,4,B0002ERWRS,"I loved this movie.  I saw it on Logo one morning, and had to leave before the end.. I tried to rent it but no one had it available, so I checked out amazon.. I just had to have it.  When I want a movie that puts me in a hopeful frame of mind, this is it.  The acting was good, the story was great, and the overall feel of the movie was amazing.  Some characters go from depression to love, and others go from love to depression and back.. I think this is a movie that is well worth the time and money.  I would suggest that if you can watch it before you buy it, you do, but.. I do recommend it.",1168473600,2,596,3.774193548387097
2082201,4,B0002ERWRS,"This tale of three Mexican cousins follows their adventures over five years after they cross the U.S. border into California. After taking refuge with their uncle in Los Angeles they settle into work as undocumented day laborers, waiting each morning at an appointed spot for employers to come by and recruit them for odd jobs.

At times some of the jobs become more permanent, but the men soon learn that nothing is guaranteed -- a foreman might try to cheat them out of their wages, or an entire business may close overnight. So, after a while each of the men tires of the exploitation and sets out to find his own way to a better life. For two of them the results are dubiously lucrative, as one becomes an enforcer for a local drug dealer and the other a ""kept man"" for a wealthy woman whose marriage has gone sour.

It is the third cousin's job at a West Hollywood art gallery that provides the most surprising elements of the story, as he falls in love with the male owner of the gallery and struggles to be open about his sexuality. Interestingly, it is his situation that ends up being the most stable and rewarding, as he is eventually able to move out of his uncle's house and obtain a Green Card.

While obviously a low budget production, this movie features excellent performances and despite some dark and dramatic turns concludes on a positive note. If in the end it plays a bit like soap opera, at least it is a very good one.

The film is shown full-screen and DVD extras are barebones (indexed scene selection and previews for other movies.)",1159660800,18,1558,4.51418439716312
2082202,5,B0002ERWRS,"I found this film to be miraculously realistic and a much-needed look into the lives of undocumented (i.e., illegal) workers from Latin America trying to survive in the United States.  Three men arrive in the US and struggle to lead honorable lives, but find it much more difficult than they had imagined.

The film takes place over the course of a number of years, and it is quite a journey. I highly recommend it to everyone in the US.  You will never again pass by a group of ""day laborers"" waiting to be picked up by a truck offering work without giving a bit more thought to what they are going through.

Beautiful movie, beautifully acted and put together.  You will be so glad you watched this movie.",1158451200,7,707,4.4921875
2082203,5,B0002ERWRS,"This film is an excellent story, that for the small budget created a good drama.  It is both a story of a family growing apart and one man's coming out to his family.  By far, as Gay Coming Out Story it definitely beats the sad sack which was ""Latter Days,"" it will most assuredly not depress you.

Also, lots of sexy shirtless scenes from the hottest of the three latin guys, yum!",1150070400,2,381,4.263888888888889

8027352,5,B0002ERWRS,"I was born and raised in south central Texas-San Antonio.  Yes it was a middle class white family.  I could not help but be exposed to the Hispanic-Latino culture.  This film is one of the best description of all the men and women that came to this country for a better life.  This is one film not to miss!!  NJMJr!!
PS there are many more that are trying desperately to get here because of the horrors they bear witness to!!  We are of country of many, many groups of immigrants and should help them that flee these horrors!!  NJMJr!.",1504137600,,535,4.343434343434343

8027356,4,B0002ERWRS,"I liked this movie, yes it is a coming out story but not the typical type that we have all seen.  This film goes further than just personal coming out conflicts and brings in to play the family relationships and problems of a culture that does not typically accept, or talk about gays in their families.

This movie is worth watching.  It had a nice ending, but not really what I expedited.  If you also purchase movies with gay themes, or characters this movie is worth buying.",1271203200,,478,4.459770114942529
8027357,5,B0002ERWRS,"I had no idea of what to expect when I decided to buy this movie and was more than surprised at how totally engrossing it turned out to be.  I liked how it managed to capture the essence of Latin families, who stick together through thick and thin.  It also manages to have a reasonably happy ending.  The gay character does not only NOT die, but is shown to be the most stable of the three (very good-looking) protagonists.  A welcome addition to the Gay Chicano genre (try Star Maps, Quinceaera or East Side Story).",1254182400,2,517,4.410526315789474
8027358,5,B0002ERWRS,"I bought this movie blind without knowing anything about it. I was pleasantly surprise at how great it is. Bond between brothers through the different road they take is tested and the result is extremely heartfelt.
Cliched at times but wonderful in it's execution. Definitely recommended.",1207699200,4,288,5.282608695652174

8027360,4,B0002ERWRS,"I really enjoyed this movie, it had a way of drawing you into these three guys lives and how each one saw and took the oppertunity of the new life in America. Maybe a bit of a feel good movie, cos i am sure in real life it would be difficult to make such drastic changes from the bad ways you have adopted, but it shows that if you do fail you can change. Had a good storyline and was well acted. Guys are goodlooking and can act too, a double jewel. It kept me watching and i do recommend it.
