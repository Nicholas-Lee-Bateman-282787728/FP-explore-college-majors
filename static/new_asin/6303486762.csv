Kieslowski gives us various signs to interpret throughout ""Blue""  and ""White"" but it is in ""Red"" that they all resolve  and still provides us with new dilemmas to take with us into our human  lives.

It helps us feel the unseen interconnections, synchronicity and sacred mystery in life.  I love the development of the relationship between the elderly, cynical judge and the young, vulnerable, idealistic Valentine.

663508,5,6303486762,"Red is co-written, produced, and directed by the Polish filmmaker, Krzysztof Kieslowski. It is the third film in the trilogy, Three Colors. The color red is said to signify fraternity, which was fitting, since friendship and connectedness were significant themes throughout the plot.

Tension continually built between fate and freewill causing the viewer to wonder if the events in each character's life were orchestrated by a higher power or a consequence of chance. It was very serendipity-esque without the typical problems of cheesy romantic comedies. The contrived coincidences in this film are clear, yet subtle.

Valentine, the female lead character played a role that was wholly good. Her goodness was so pure that it resembled naivety in the first half of the movie. She played opposite of the older cynical character, Joseph, who saw so little goodness in the world that he tested Valentine on a number of occasions to see how she will react. Although, Joseph is the one testing Valentine, it is he who finds a kind of salvation in her. She saves him from his self-destructive patterns and reconnects him to the humanity in the world around him.

Joseph emerges with redeeming characteristics near the end of the film as he makes his transformation, but the very character flaws that contribute to his cynicism were ones that I found beautiful at their core. He is a retired judge who finds entertainment in spying on his neighbors by tapping their phone lines and listening into their calls. He advocates a truth that knows no bounds. Just as Valentine matures in her ability to see the complexities of her surroundings, Joseph too, grows out of his naivety that truth is the end all goal. He too, comes to understand the complexities of humanity and redemption in the greatest truth of all. He shed light on the darkest corner of his world and turned himself into the police, which in turn, connected him to the broken people all around him.

663614,5,6303486762,"As you consider watching or buying this movie you may be wondering if you need to see ""Blue"" or ""White"" the earlier movies in the trilogy.

I can assure you with confidence, not only Red brilliant filmmaking, not only does it have a compelling story, and not only is Irene Jacob a beautiful presence, it can be viewed as a stand alone movie. I do recommend though that you see these other movies too.

When entered at the Cannes Film Festival, no less a person than Quentin Tarantino declared that this movie should have won the Palme d'Or. The movie that ""Red"" lost to was ""Pulp Fiction"" by...Quentin Tarantino.

Due to Oscar politics, it was precluded from being nominated as Best Foreign language Picture until Academy members, some notable movie directors, wrote in and complained that it was not nominated.  It then got three nominations for cinematography, directing and writing.

As Kiezloski himself says, so much in this movie is picked up by your subconscious, and then it becomes clearer with repeated viewing. You may learn a lot more from the third viewing than the first.

Red could be described as many things. Ultimately, it's about the healing power of love, connection, coincidence, parallel lives, all knowingness, voyeurism, boundaries.  You may notice reverberations such as mens behavior towards dogs, the repeated sound of radio static, storms, flat batteries, pens, books being dropped, album cover on a table, same locations used repeatedly, the one arm bandit machine, how connections are made and nearly missed.

I would recommend that you watch The Double Life of Veronique before you see this movie, because it's an earlier movie featuring the same actress and director, and you may notice some common patterns between the two movies. That movie is highly recommended by Roger Ebert.

Once again, Irene Jacob excels as the main character.

663617,4,6303486762,"The final film of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy, Red (Rouge), released in 1994, is almost universally acclaimed as the best of the films. For once, the common consensus is correct. Of course, if one is to believe some of the online reviews of this film, and the whole trilogy, there are plenty of people who seriously question whether or not Three Colors is a better trilogy than the two Star Wars trilogies, that of The Matrix, or even The Lord Of The Rings. Let me end that debate, once and for all. It is far better than those comic book level films, and real comparisons need to be made with some of the truly great cinematic trilogies, such as Ingmar Bergman's Spider trilogy, or Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Alienation trilogy (L'Avventura, La Notte, and L'Eclisse).
  As with the prior two films, Red was written by Kieslowski and his writing partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz. It is a brilliant film, with the depth of Blue, pathos of White, and character definitions better than either prior entry. The film follows the parallel lives of a small group of people in a town just outside of Geneva, Switzerland. The main character is a beautiful brunet model named Valentine Dussault (Irne Jacob), whose boyfriend Michel is never seen, but ever calling her. The film opens with him calling her, and getting a busy signal, shot in away that recalls the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. He is clearly an unstable and jealous man, who harangues Valentine, whose insecurities keep her attached to him, despite knowing, somewhere inside of her, that they are wrong for each other. Jacob is in one of those roles that defines an actor- a career making choice; even more so than her dual role in The Double Life Of Veronique. Her character seems to embody decency and goodness, and radiates love and compassion throughout the film, both visually and personally. It is the sort of role that recalls that given by Setsuko Hara in Tokyo Story, or, more recently, Claire Danes in Shopgirl (although she reminds me of British actress Finola Hughes in looks). Hers is the sort of dream woman that a man never meets; not because she's a model, but because she is almost preternaturally good and filled with a love of life and others- even down to her name. She believes that people are not bad, merely weak.... It is the sort of art that if you ask, `What is it about?', it cannot be answered in a sentence or two. Dozens of small details suffuse it. Valentine lives near a caf called Chez Joseph, then meets Joseph Kern; Auguste abandons then retrieves the dog given to him by Karin while Kern's dog is abandoned then embraced by him once Valentine saves it; Auguste has a photo of a dancer in his apartment, and Valentine dances; the veterinarian she takes Rita to is named Marc, like her brother, etc. This is a tale that is not so dumbed down, ala Hollywood films, that even a detailed syllabus could justice it. It is linear in spots, yet intuitive throughout. One could easily see it going off tangentially to follow any of a dozen minor characters, and the thrust of the film would have remained intact, even though it would have been a wholly different film. Still, it would have been a great film, for there is an undeniable immanence to greatness, and this fact is something that few critics can grasp. The greatness of Red, and to an extent, the whole Three Colors trilogy, is that such intellectual grasping is not necessary to feel greatness. Thus, art at its best.",1221523200,3,3509,4.713355048859935
663618,4,6303486762,"Red (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994)

Kieslowski wrapped up his Trois Couleurs trilogy with Rouge, and like the others, it's entirely different from its predecessors. I've heard a number of people say this was their least favorite film, and for most of it, I have to say I agreed with them-- but then came the final shot, and as far as I was concerned, all was forgiven. It's hard to forget that Kieslowski was a genius when he keeps doing stuff like the final shot in this movie.

The story centers on Valentine (Irene Jacob), who, like all of Kieslowski's protagonists, is having some major personal problems. She discovers that one of her neighbors, a man known only as The Judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), is spying on his neighbors with bushels of sophisticated equipment. She is initially outraged, but after accidentally overhearing a conversation, she starts to understand the intrigue of spying, and wonders whether it might be able to help her out. (Not that a Kieslowski protagonist would go to such lengths, but still.) I'd like to say the movie goes on to explore the relationship between Valentine and the Judge, or that Valentine reaches a crisis point about her conflicting opinions of the Judge's hobby, but I can't-- I've just described the end of the film to you, not the beginning. Which means Kieslowski, who was never anything less than exact, meant the viewer to get everything from that which preceded Valentine's meeting with the Judge, and her initial feelings towards him. But that's so... un-Kieslowski.

Still, Kieslowski's genius with dialogue and his perfectionism with camerawork make this a stunning technical achievement, and the script (which was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar [losing to Pulp Fiction; far less embarrassing than losing Best Director to Robert Zemeckis for the godawful Forrest Gump]) manages to be compelling without anything actually happening. This is very Kieslowski-like, at least.

As a part of the trilogy, it's a must; as a stand-alone film, I'm not so sure, for you'll lose the effect of the final moments. But if you haven't already started watching the trilogy, you should. Kieslowski, during his brief career, was probably the best director on the planet. *** ",1219104000,,2226,5.0710382513661205
663619,5,6303486762,"Valentine ( Irene Jacob ), a Swiss model, runs over a dog and haps on the owner ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ), who is an old judge. Although the judge begins talking about his past, what he says also depicts Valentine's future. There's the linkage between his past and her destiny! On the other hand, Auguste ( Jean-Pierre Lorit ) is preparing for the exam to be a judge...
 Red implies passion, but also means fraternity. This motion picture depicts cyclical destiny and human spirit.
Jacob, the star of ""Double life of Veronique,"" is vivid in Kieslowski's movie. Trintignant expresses the old judge who is revived by Valentine well. Lorit's silent performance is notable.
 Director Kieslowski is good at depicting two things at the same time. In Red, he expresses the linkage between the past of the old judge and heroine's destiny. Kieslowski uses unique, artistic, and abstract expression. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music. In addition, he represents the characters of the hero and heroines of The Three Colors Trilogy ( Blue, White, Red )by contrasting the each reaction toward an old lady through three stories. Also, it is interesting that 3 stories are intertwined.
 The three colors trilogy consists of 3 films ( Blue, White, Red ) . The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity. Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies.

663620,5,6303486762,"Plot:

A young model living in Geneva, a judge become connected through controversial means.

My Review:

Kieslowski's trilogy ends with the colour Red as well as summing up the previous two films. TC: Red deals with various divides in society, and manages to dissolve 'segregation' blurring the lines of the 'fated-universe'.

Focus is given to Valentine (Irene Jacob) an introverted model who seems naive but not at all in the stupid sense, the public eye always domineering and judging eyes that watch her strut the catwalk. In accidentally running over a strangers dog, throws her into a deeper understanding of what it means to judge. She meets the pivotal figure in all this, a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Having seen the recent 'The Lives of Others' it mirrors itself to the socio-political conflict during 1980's Berlin, Germany where the Stasi had keen ears on every suspecting house.

The most intellectual corollary that Kieslowski's three pieces ornate or always will ornate, is the adeptly writing style that envelops them all. Kieslowski doesn't incessantly draw out emotional dialogue and raw edge to cataclysm by overbearing it with needless flamboyant words to stay a finale; like many Hollywood pieces today. He is simple, if you were to ask someone ""Do you love me?"", and you mean 'yes', in requisite your answer should be a ""Yes."" As the retired judge spends all his time engaging in espionage on his 'temptation-filled neighbours', the old man and the young woman begin to iron out the creases with the force of a startling revelation.

Verdict:

Kieslowski's knockout piece. 9/10.",1203724800,,1614,5.137404580152672
663691,5,6303486762,"Red was so relaxing to watch! It feels like a poem or watching a painting come to life. I believe it is about how compassion, or opening of the heart, splits all notions of time and space and exposes a different reality that is just outside the one we are living in, as in an alternate reality. The powerful force of a compassionate heart changes the destiny of several lives. It is a story about the breaking through to the divine within the human heart that connects us all; the mysterious dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses and is much bigger then the human seen dimension.

The woman in the movie, Valentine, was sad and went through the motions of her life seemingly disconnected from herself and her happiness. Her boyfriend was jealous and was not sure he loved her, and her brother was on the streets from drug use and Valentine seemed to be void of life, even though she was a successful model and ballerina dancer. As they showed her life they also showed the life of her across the street neighbor. He was studying to become a Judge and he too had a life that was not fulfilling or living up to his potential. Valentine and the young man never met, but their stories intertwined as if they were just out of sync with time. Mysterious and spiritual forces worked in the background weaving their lives together.

One day Valentine was driving around sad and she hit a dog. She jumped out of the car and saw the dog was bleeding. She took it to the owner outside of town. He was a dejected and bitter older retired Judge, who spent his time listening in on telephone conversations of his neighbors through a radio he setup. Once Valentine heard the conversations she became agitated and told him it is wrong. She was a sweet innocent young woman pure in beauty and their lives touched. Her loving heart changed him and he later turned himself into the police and they shut down his radio for good. She saw that in the paper and went to see him. It was his birthday and they shared some peach brandy and talked about their lives. She was to go see her boyfriend and he told her to take the Ferry. She bought a ticket.

Meanwhile the young Judge found out his girlfriend was cheating on him and he got dejected and followed her around. He too got a ticket on the same ferry as Valentine. The older Judge came to see Valentine at her modeling show and he told her similar stories of his life that mirrored the life of the young Judge. He then told her the story of his love cheating on him, just like the young Judge's story but having it end there with him lost never finding love again. Then he said that maybe the woman he never met was Valentine, making the story really feel magical like the alternate reality, just out of sync with time, would happen. And when the Ferryboat capsized and we saw the survivors as Valentine and the young Judge, we knew they would have the life they were both meant to have and somehow the older Judge would have that life too.

Excellent movie that just feels so good. The streets of the small European town, the building and their environments were all so beautiful and magical as well. I like those big coffee cups and the warm cozy feel of their lives. No cell phones, no TV's just life pure and simple and how compassion can open the heart and transform lives so profoundly that lost lives can become renewed and the very reality of time as we know it can be changed forever. Love is the healing force of the world that is what is required to transcend stuck sorrowful lives. One of the best films ever made.",1195603200,5,3582,4.390060240963855

663694,5,6303486762,"Kieslowski's masterpiece solidified his reputation as one of the world's greatest and most important directors in the last quarter of the twentieth century.  Red, the last, and easily the best of the Three Colors Trilogy represents Kieslowski's attempt to blend the red/fraternity French Revolution principle with existential philosophy, especially Jean Paul Sartre's own masterwork _Being and Nothingness.  The luminescent Valentine (Irene Jacob) expresses to Judge (Jean Louis Trintignent) her own nothingness, her own inability to stop her younger brother's slide to death and destruction over drug addiction. ""Just be"" is the Judge's simple response, a purely distilled reconcilition of all our own desperately held loves and struggles to maintain being in the face of love's onslaughts.

This DVD rendition represents a brilliant rendition of the work of Kieslowski's favorite cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski in their last collaboration.  Sobocinski somehow unobtrusively saturates the film with its eponymous color, all the while conveying multiple perspectives on the mundane.  A brilliant sunset behind a mountain, another day closes in Valentine's life, captured from her perspective inside her auto and simulataneously from the viewer's/spectator's advantage ... a subject/object reconciliation of the mundane.  Valentine and the Judge talk for the last time (or is it the first???), deeply in love with one another while, seamlessly, workers in a theater in the background yell at one another while they struggle to close the building's windows and doors as a thunderstorm approaches.  A lovers' conversation so of course time stands still, no matter how meaningless its content; suddenly the camera drops from the ceiling to the pit of the theater, perspectival chance and circumstance conveyed in the most meaningful, yet simple, way.

Redemption, compassion, synchronicity, in opposition to fate and randomness, ultimately matched in some ineffable wholeness. This film asks us to be, to immerse ourselves in our own daily immensities. This DVD version includes interviews with Jacob and Producer Martin Karmitz as well as some interesting behind-the-scene intersplices of the master Kieslowski himself.

Buy it and savor it every couple of months; like a great novel or work of philosophy, you'll take away something different everytime you view it.",1140825600,2,2365,5.6960227272727275

Kieslowski wrote that Red's theme concerns conditional mood . . . how a person might be born at the wrong time(The Judge), and how he is perfectly suited for Valentin. Red explores youth and the aged, what makes us atomized and what unites us, and, finally, free choice and destiny. Kieslowski's last work is his most complex. What we see as chance or choice is something quite different in retrospect; not exactly predestination but a weaving of choice and fate(echoed in the Bolera heard throughout the film). Mystery envelops the film . . . why did the Judge want to see her ticket? How does his dream of Valentin predict her future? Is he some sort of fortune teller(or can he effect destiny?). The color red frames the films. The beautiful symbolic subplot of an aged woman, trying to place a bottle in the trash is found in each of the works in the trilogy. But only in Red does the heroine Valentin help the infirmed woman. She sees the world in a sympathetic light and her character transforms the elderly judge, waking up to his true nature. The beautiful symbolism in this film is also exemplified by the mural of Valentin which is put up, displayed, and then, in a howling storm, removed(just as Valentin faces her own life-and-death crisis on the ferry). I believe he never did another movie because he felt he couldn't top this. The film's editor tells how Kieslowski was so moved by the film that he cried during the editing.

663700,5,6303486762,"Look up the word brotherhood or fraternity in the dictionary and one will find its gender bias, as in ""the quality of being brotherly"" or ""a group of persons associated by or as by ties of brotherhood.""  That being the case, when the slogan of Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite was taken up as the motto of the French Revolution, that last word seemed to have excluded women.  In the final film of Kryszstof Kieslowski's Tricoleurs trilogy, Rouge, the person who plays the voice of human compassion happens to be fashion model Valentine Dussaut.  A fitting first name, Valentine as in love, but a universal caring love for one's fellow human as opposed to a single person.

Her life changes one night when she accidentally hits a German Shepherd named Rita.  Upon tracing the dog to its owner, she discovers a retired judge whose indifference to the animal's plight disgusts her.  She cares for the dog but it runs away back home.  There, she finds out the judge has a radio set to a frequency where he can eavesdrop on the telephone conversations of his neighbours.  His justification is that with his snooping, there is an accurate way to judge.  He gives the example of a man he acquitted who was actually guilty.

But Valentine counters him by saying that people aren't bad, but that sometimes they are weak.  This later leads to the realization that a judge makes his decision based on facts and evidence and not by standing in the other person's shoes.  Being empathic thus forges the connection of brotherhood between one person and another.  The judge deduces Valentine's hatred of a drug dealer with her heroin-addicted brother, while she later figures out why the judge has become someone who doesn't care for anyone, nor been in love with anyone.  By being empathic, one discovers the other person's weakness, and by eliminating that weakness, makes the other person better.

Another subplot involves a target of the judge's eavesdropping.  It involves the relationship between a woman who runs a telephone meteorological service and a student preparing to enter the bar.  The circumstances of this student eerily parallels that of the judge's early life.

Red as a colour appears throughout, mostly as a contrast colour in the streets of Paris.  In terms of fraternity, or of being connected with one's fellow human being, there's Valentine, whose face is reddened from her ballet workout with her classmates.  The law student's car is red.  However, the biggest impact of red in the film is the enormous poster of Valentine's profile, with a bright red background.  The caption on the left reads ""la fraicheur de vie,"" or ""the freshness of life.""

One interesting motif I noticed was the bent old lady struggling to shove the bottle in the tall bin.  She appeared in both Bleu and Blanc, and did so but with immense difficulty.  Small wonder that Valentine, who's fraternity, is the only one who actually helps the old woman, and not Julie (Bleu-Liberte) nor Karol (Blanc-Egalite).

Both leads, Irene Jacob (Valentine) and veteran actor Jean Louis Trignitant (the judge) carry the film.  The latter's transformation of someone whose soul is rescued by Valentine is simply incredible.  Samuel LeBihan, who's the photographer shooting Valentine, would later have larger roles as the male lead in two Audrey Tautou movies, The Venus Beauty Institute and He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not.

The final scene reunites the protagonists from Bleu and Blanc, the two movies, to encapsulate the concepts of Liberte and Egalite of those films, showing them to be inseparable from Fraternite.  The best of the three movies.",1105228800,,3614,4.945273631840796

663792,5,6303486762,"This film deals mostly with unexpected friendship and exchange of information between the youthful, idealistic, and beautiful model Valentine and the rather grizzled old misanthropic judge for whom life has no meaning and who spends his days wiretapping his neighbors. One of his neighbors is having an affair and the judge has recorded some pretty intimate conversations on tape. Valentine spends her days modeling and attending ballet classes; huge advertising posters bathed in red of her  appear around Geneva; one night she hits a dog with her car which provides the reason for this relationship to develop. Each has something to offer the other: Valentine offers the cynical judge hope through her youth and the art of conversation and gentle persuasion; after his conversations with her, the tired old man gives up wiretapping and turns himself into authorities, and emerges with a new,more positive attitude (the fact that his dog has a litter of 7 puppies also helps); the judge has his personal history to relate to Valentine which she feels may be important to her future.  ""I feel something important is going on here,"" she says.  He relates a dream he had recently in which Valentine was 50 and ""woke up beside someone."" Valentine takes his dream seriously.  His history includes a long ago love  with a woman who rejected him when he was a young lawyer (""all her furniture was white,she was blonde"")  and whose lover he convicted of a crime many years later, after this, his only love, died in a car accident.
  Perhaps by accident, Valentine lives across the street in Geneva from a young lawyer whose life very closely resembles the old judge in his youth in numerous ways.  The film details the young lawyer Auguste's daily life as a law student in Geneva, in which he is also spurned by a woman.  Valentine has a boyfriend in London whom she talks with on the phone,a long-distance romance, and also a mother and younger brother who live in Calais. Unbeknownst to her mother, her younger brother is a drug addict. Valentine discusses her brother, who never knew his own father, with the judge. Valentine plans to visit her boyfriend in London but on the Channel ferry trip, which she looked forward to very much and about which she shares her enthusiasm with the old judge, the ferry boat sinks in bad weather and she and the young lawyer from Geneva are the only Swiss survivors.  It is left to speculate whether Valentine and Auguste can develop a relationship.
  ""Red"" has a positive tone, but the 1st installment in this trilogy,""Blue"" is somewhat less optimistic. It concerns the 33-year-old woman who loses her famous composer husband and child in a car accident. The woman wants to forget her former life and rents an apartment in Paris to distance herself from all attachments, except for her mother who lives in a nursing home. She throws away her husband's musical scores, even knowing they are an important contribution to musical history. Some reviewers have commented that this attempt at detachment could be similar to Eastern religions.  In this film, unlike ""Red"", animals have a negative connotation. She befriends a prostitute who lives downstairs and comes to appreciate some similarities between a street musician's flute music and her husband's.  Eventually she is willing to help one of her husband's former associates ( who has loved her for some time) complete an unfinished score.  But she finds out that her husband was having an affair of several years duration with a young attractive lawyer, who is now pregnant with his child..  Forgiving her, she makes arrangements to will  her part of her husband's estate.
  The film is bathed in blue, much more so than ""Red"" is bathed in red.  She swims several times in a local pool--all blue--she owns a blue mobile sculpture, for starters.  There are numerous closeups of her face in this film and it is truly a one-actress film.",1092268800,2,3919,4.888217522658611
663793,2,6303486762,"A very dissapointing finale to the trilogy, Rouge stars another beautiful woman (Irene Jacob), this time as a model named Valentine. Thru the circumstance of hitting a dog and trying to find its owner, she comes to meet a retired judge who keeps track of his neighbours' phone calls with surveillance equipment.
My dissapointment with Red is that it has a potentially ground-breaking movie in this idea. In a pivotal scene, the judge responds to Valentine's confrontation over the surveillance by pointing out to her that helping the people she hears on his equipment may not be as simple as she thinks, and that sometimes one would do better to listen.
The movie could have taken this and make Valentine realize it more fully. Instead, it vindicates Valentine in her unformed and irrational disgust, tells us that judgment and even reality are arrogant illusions, and in its conclusion paints the judge as a traumatized, fragile soul in need of repentance. A fitting nihilistic end for a director who wanted to get to work destroying human values. While he does so intelligently, adroitly and subtly in Blue and White, here his enterprise fails.",1089504000,4,1146,4.973958333333333
663794,5,6303486762,"Despite being the finale of the critically acclaimed ""Colors"" trilogy, ""Red"" (""Rouge"") need not be seen after the similarly beloved ""Blue"" (""Bleu"") and ""White"" (""Blanc""). As warm and rich as the shades of red scattered through it, this film is one of the most compelling non-American releases in years.
On her way home from a modelling session, Valentine (Irene Jacob) accidently runs over and injures a pregnant dog. The owner is Joseph Kern, (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an embittered, cynical ex-judge whose years of condemnation and acquittal have left him spiritually adrift. He now spends his time alone in his house, wiretapping the phones of his neighbors and predicting what will happen in their lives.
After Valentine expresses disgust at Joseph's activities, he turns himself in to the authorities. Their friendship grows into a bond of differing values and unhappy histories. As Valentine prepares to leave for England, the judge reveals the tragic circumstances of his early life -- a tragedy mirrored by some of the people he has been spying on.
Where ""Blue"" was cool and sensual and ""White"" was sharp and sexy, ""Red"" has a sweetness and richness to its story. Valentine's name suggests love, and that love -- a platonic friendship that teeters on romantic love -- brings Joseph back from his unhealthy cynicism. Her kindness and unhappiness appeal to him, reassuring him that people are not intrinsically bad. His spiritual transformation is subtle, but convincing; it's mirrored by the sun shining down on him near the film's end.
Few filmmakers could pull off the symbolism that springs up in any of the ""Colors"" movies. In this one, red springs up everywhere -- walls, glasses, jeeps, lipstick, clothing, phones, bowling balls, little lights lining a model runway. The most obvious example is the enormous red picture of Valentine that's put up over the city.
The writing is simple but profound, with immense weight on simple statements like ""Why don't you do anything?"" or ""You deserve to die!"" Perhaps the only questionable part of the movie is the way it draws together characters from ""White"" and ""Blue."" It's either strained or genius -- hard to tell which.
Jacob does an excellent job with the difficult character of Valentine. She's almost too nice and innocent to be real, the incarnation of all that is good, but Jacob makes her come to life; without a word, she can convey a wealth of emotion with her face. Trintignant has a harder job: he has to bring across the weary, existentialist judge without making him unsympathetic. And he does so astoundingly.
In the French flag, red stands for fraternity. Not necessarily in the sense of brothers or college pals, but rather a love for one's fellow man. And that sense of fraternity is what drives ""Red.""",1075766400,10,2775,5.008658008658009

663797,4,6303486762,"RED ends the film trilogy that began with BLUE and WHITE. By the end of RED, it's apparent that one had better see the other two first in order to get the point of them all.
Valentine (Irene Jacob) is a fashion and photography model living in Geneva. One night while driving, her car hits a dog, which she subsequently takes to the vet to be patched up. From the address on the animal's collar, she tracks down the pet's owner, a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who has no interest in keeping the dog. As a matter of fact, the man has little interest in life whatsoever except to eavesdrop on the wireless phone conversations of his neighbors. Slowly, however, the chance encounter between Valentine and The Judge grows into a platonic friendship. The potential for other random encounters swirls around Valentine. Some may happen; most will likely not. But this one occurred, and both participants are the better for it.
RED must be the last film of the trilogy seen. At it's conclusion, a most improbable coincidence brings together the major characters of all three. The lesson of BLUE, WHITE and RED in the aggregate appears to be that life is a series of coincidences, and the potential for personal growth from any connection between one or more individuals is a mine of great richness if one cares to work it. Humans are reputed to be a social species. However, the trilogy is perhaps best appreciated by a ""people person"", who relishes the interaction of daily encounters whether random or not. I'm not that sort (much to my wife's perpetual disgust), so my regard for the series is muted.
I was prepared to give RED three stars until the conclusion, after which I boosted it to four. I recognize the ability of the film, and the trilogy, to stimulate opinionated discussion, which, as long as it doesn't degenerate into name-calling and fisticuffs, is a swell thing, especially over pizza and beer.
RED, WHITE and BLUE also makes the point that there's commonality in the experiences of varied individuals. In each film, the major character observes an old person struggling to insert an empty bottle into the elevated aperture of a large, curbside container for recyclables. Only in RED does the protagonist (Valentine) give aid. Whether there's more to this symbolism or not could be the starting point of another discussion. It only indicated to me that Valentine was the more generous and less self-absorbed of the three.

The interweaving of the plotline as the film winds to it?s completion was superb, and incredibly complex. I believe you could watch the series out of order, but would miss out on the recapitulation of the series characters that occurs in the final film.

663799,5,6303486762,"With ""Red,"" Kieslowski completes his trilogy of films with a sigh of relief and a humane and deep feeling of Compassion: embodied in the very human and emotionally available performance of Irene Jacob as Valentine.
Everything about Valentine's life is chaotic: her boyfriend (who we only hear on the phone and never see) is at the very least, mixed up, she is estranged from her family, and to top everything off...she runs over a dog named Rita. But it is this twist that sets the plot in motion and introduces us to Rita's owner, Joseph Kern (Jean Louis Trintignant) an ex-judge whose secret life involves high-tech spying equipment and listening in on his neighbor's phone conversations. Yet upon seeing Valentine for the first time and hearing the sound of her voice, Kern confesses all and even directs her to inform on him to his neighbors. For Kieslowski and Kern then, Valentine is the symbol of all that is good and as such nothing evil can survive around her.
""Red"" is all about caring and making emotional connections. In one very short, very telling scene Valentine watches as a senior citizen tries to put a bottle into a recycle receptacle that is too high for her. Valentine rushes over and helps. This same scene occurs in both ""Blue"" and ""White"" but the heroines in those films are too pre-occupied to even notice much less offer help.
""Red"" was Kieslowski's last film and he finished it very near the time of his death. It is told in the voice of someone, close to death, who has decided to embrace only what is positive and good. ""Red"" is ultimately then...about Love.",1050192000,3,1587,4.712230215827338

These three films, of which Red is the last, and perhaps - to my mind - the least satisfying (although, if you have seen the first two films you will love the deliberately artificial 'tying up of loose ends') form a close-knit trilogy and together offer a perfect example of what European film makers do so well and Hollywood does so badly, spellbindingly slow studies of character and situation that draw you in, that you need to relax into like a hot bath. I shan't go into the symbolism of the three films - the themes of colour and ""freedom, equality and fraternity"" - as that is dissected far better in the other reviews. I will say, however, that you don't need to know any of that and can enjoy these films as simply great beautiful works of art.

663908,5,6303486762,"I just had the opportunity to watch the three components of this magnificent trilogy that wrapped up the creative life of Polish-born director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and while I still think that watching the three in order (in the same order as they were released, after the French flag: ""Blue,"" ""White"" and ""Red"") I found ""Red"" to be beyond just the culmination of the series. Irne Jacob (Valentine), who had previously worked with Kieslowski in his 1991 feature ""The Double Life of Veronique"" delivers a fascinating performance by staying right on the verge of falling for the retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) whom she manages to subtly redeem, but never letting herself go... Her fate is almost written by the judge, a character that gradually becomes omniscient and ""all powerful,"" ultimately driving Valentine toward her destiny, one which somehow does not differ much from ending in love with him... (intriguing huh?)
A story of love (thus the color red), somehow; a story of redemption in a way as well, although the movie can stand by itself it curiously goes beyond itself if you have had a chance to watch all three. As an example of this, note the old hunchback lady struggling to push an empty bottle into the recycling bin, and the reactions of the main characters in the three movies. In ""Blue,"" Julie shows total indifference, eyes closed, denoting ""freedom,"" liberty from the world, from life, ""independence."" In ""White,"" Karol contemplates the lady struggling but does little to help her, after all (he might have thought to himself,) ""my life is every bit as miserable or even  worse -let her deal with her own misery."" A sign of ""equality"" it could be said, though clearly misunderstood, every bit as much as Jelie's ""liberty."" Finally, in ""Red"" Valentine helps the lady with the bottle (a sign of charity, love or ""fraternity,"" if you may). A very clear connection between the movies' titles and the ideals that each of them conveys in the French national flag, way beyond the illumination that also characterizes each of the movies.
The movie brilliantly ends in a tone that makes it clear to the viewer that the main characters of the three-part series accomplished closure, redemption in their lives, by ending up next to their truly loved ones.

663910,5,6303486762,"'Red' is the most magical of the 'Three Colours' trilogy, one in which metamorphosis or spiritual transformation is central.  'Blue' and 'White' could never be confused with social realism, but both were true to the inner, poetic reality of their protagonists.  This isn't the case with 'Red' - none of its four main characters can be said to dominate the film: although there is definitely a controlling consciousness, it's not clear whose it is.  As always with Kieslowski, the film's first sequence sets out its strategies in miniature.  On an unexceptial Genevan (NOT Parisian!) street, the camera picks out one character and his dog, abandons them to peer into the bedroom of its heroine, Valentine, a student and model with a jealous boyfriend we hear but never see, who is working in England.  Despite the technical virtuosity of this one-shot sequence, this opening could be considered realistic: we are introduced to characters and their environment.  But there are two details that work against this.  The heroine lives above a cafe called Chez Joseph, which also happens to be the name of the film's anti-hero, the misanthropic ex-judge Kern, who eavesdrops on his neighbour's telephone conversations by radio.  This is only the first of the film's many patterned coincidences which take us out of psychological realism into a different kind of storytelling (the cafe sign is in red which will similarly, anti-realistically, be splashed throughout the film).
The second detail is that the heroine is not introduced by her self, in person, but by her voice on the answering machine.  Immediately we have a split within selves, between the present and the absent, that proliferates in this film of doubles, shadows and correspondances.  Not only do characters mirror others, but individual characters see their identities diffused through different media (telephones, photographs, newspapers, TV, radio etc.), means of mechanical reproduction which assume a fetishstic or spiritual power.  Despite its apparent realism, then, 'Red' is a work of magic or fantasy.  When Valentine first enters Kern's dark, dank bungalow (a modern Plato's cave), having run over his dog, the camera takes on the sinister point-of-view familiar from slasher films, while the bleeping radio sounds announcing the judge seem like the laboratory appurtenances of a mad professor.  In the second, more important meeting, the fact that Valentine is crossing thresholds into a magic realm is doubly signalled.  The gate and dooorway is guarded by the mythical dog who brought the pair toghter, by way of a church.  Before she enters, a wind suddenly shivers the leaves of a framing tree; later, at the moment we are supposed to hate him for his moral nihilism, Kern summons a blinding epiphany of sunlight.  He may be a monster, but in his 'eavesdropping' on others, his making connections between disparate, disorganised lives and his creating consoling fictions in the face of tragedy, Kern is a substitute for both director and viewer.  In the figure of the young judge, who seems to exactly replay the older man's life (both of whom are never seen in the same scene), we have that haunting Proustian conflation of past, present and future, the outer world and inner life, that Kieslowski strove for, but didn't quite catch, in 'Blue'.
'Red' is the most sympathetic of all the films in the 'Three Colours' trilogy.  Perhaps this is because red is a warmer colour than blue or white.  Or because Preisner's score is lusher, almost celebratory, close to Maurice Jarre.  Maybe it's because Irene Jacob is a much more open, generous actress than her predecessors - like her name and colour, Valentine seems to irradiate love.  Sometimes her innocence is too ideal to be true, and we find ourselves much more drawn to the fascinatingly ambiguous, charismatic, persuasive figure of the judge.  Their stagy dialogues could have had the banal quality of Shavian dialectic if it wasn't for the metatextual patterns that cast shadows around the coherence of their words, shadows that make the film at once soul-soaring and unforgivingly bleak - is salvation of the few really worth the deaths of thousands?",1022198400,21,4182,5.128129602356407
663911,5,6303486762,"In Krzysztof Kieslowski's 1994 Red, we might think that God has taken early retirement.  A retired Geneva judge conducts telephone surveillance of his neighbors in a kind of weary Calvinist curiosity about life.  This is hardly the God of Abraham, a whirlwind speaking to Job, but a postmodernist cripple discarded by his times.  When Valentine finds her way to his door after hitting his German shepherd with her car, he makes no effort to conceal his wiretapping hobby, and virtually encourages her to go next door and inform those on whom he's eavesdropping.  She does so, but once she's invited in and begins to size up the family who live there, she realizes she's no longer sure what the right thing to do is.  The judge's existential view that we're defined more by our actions than by our ideas may have started her thinking but is directed much more at the audience.
 The judge is a kind of twentieth century Prospero, damaged, skeptical, and disillusioned with life and the ability to make judgments.  As fascinated as Kieslowski is by the judge, and by chance and human fate, however, I think he has more sympathy with Valentine and her youthful optimism.  When the howling storm blows open the doors of a building, she closes them.  When neighbors throw stones through the judge's window, she sweeps up the broken glass.  When she runs over the judge's dog, she picks her up, finds the owner, then transports her to the vet.  She too wonders about destiny but never gives up believing in free will, responsibility and the need for judgment.
 In contrast to the depressed Auguste who ties up and abandons his dog, when Valentine takes Rita out, she let's her run free.  Yet the audience is likely to focus more on what looks like the hand of fate, as that freedom leads her back to the judge.
 The phone call that opens the film shoots its way long distance through cables that travel underwater only to get a busy signal.
When Auguste takes his dog for a walk, it starts to veer into the street and he pulls the leash back, saving it from possibly being hit by a car.  Kieslowski is showing us that to say that Valentine's running over Rita is fate is too simple.  People can be careful or careless.  And people have a choice; they can run from responsibility or take the dog to its owner, take it on to the vet, or leave it with the owner.
Why, of all movies, did Valentine's boyfriend recommend Dead Poet's Society?
When Valentine hits the jackpot on the slot machine, she comments, ""I think I know why I won,"" as if she feels that life, fate, rewards or punishes us.
If Joseph Kern is a postmodernist God, it's interesting that his dog leads her into, and out of, a church.
Kern tells Valentine, somewhat mysteriously, that it was easy to find her address.  Easy for him maybe, with his power to look into human lives.
Kern says the conversations on which he eavesdrops are ""entertaining.""  This is a voice of self-irony, God as couch potato, and self-disgusted.
""Why don't you do anything?"" Kern asks Valentine, as she expresses her repugnance for what she sees him doing.  It's an existential question, a philosophical challenge.  He wants to know, to understand, the springs of behavior, the nature of human nature, the ambiguity of good and evil, the purpose of life.
The face of the man under the money who later appears on the cover of the CD Valentine likes-but can't buy because the last one has been sold-who is he?  Looks like an 18th century print.  The name given by the store clerk, according to one review I read, is a pseudonym for the movie's composer, Zbigniew Preisner.  I searched for photos of John Calvin, the Geneva theologian of predestination, and not much resemblance and a different style of dress.
""Were you a policeman?""  Valentine asks Kern.  ""Worse,"" he responds, ""a judge.""  Like most intellectuals of relativism and the postmodernist age, he's no longer sure he knows good from evil.  Making judgments is suspect.  But Valentine does not hesitate to ""judge"" the (alleged) drug-dealing neighbor:  ""You deserve to die,"" she pronounces.
Kern says it doesn't matter whether Valentine reveals the truth to the neighbors.  Intervention will mean little, he says.  Either way, sooner or later, it will come out the same way.  He's resigned to fate, and he's oppressed, worn-out by his fatalism and resignation.
Later, he tells her to leave, go to England.  ""It's your destiny,"" he says.  Don't try to help your brother, he says.  All you can do is ""be.""
Moviegoers and critics seem to eat up this idea of fate.  It's very sexy, intriguing, dramatic, good movie material.  A banner ad on the NYTimes webpage for the new movie Happenstance shows a woman, who looks not unlike Irene Jacob, and the words ""Chance, Destiny, Liaison.""  Kieslowski has put it out there, but I think he also takes some of it back-maybe life is not all fate.
As Valentine drives her car down the hill from the judge's house, the camera shows the view ahead and the view in her rear-view mirror.
The broken glass at the bowling alley is certainly intriguing, but hasn't something been left out?  Broken in anger?  Even before Auguste eavesdrops at Karin's window?  How/why did he become so suspicious?  All we're shown are a couple of unanswered phone calls Auguste makes.  Auguste shouldn't be paranoid like Valentine's awful boyfriend.
The ad agency/chewing gum company chooses the photo of Valentine looking sad, not chewing gum.  What is this telling us?  The consumption society casts itself as the solution to the problem of human sadness.  But the gum in the lock, vandalism by ""Turks,"" is a tough symbol.
I did not understand why Kieslowski chooses to spend as much film as he does showing Kern get in his car, close his garage doors, drive to the fashion house and park, especially when there otherwise doesn't seem to be a single foot of film that doesn't fit into the whole and resonate.
I don't know if I grasped the point of the janitor who helps carry the cleaning woman's heavy buckets either, but at least it feels interesting.  There is at least some fraternity in life, notwithstanding human nature.
The camera gives us a long, slow, stationary shot of a slab of iron when the ferry ramp is drawn up.  There's a narrow slit through which we can see the ferry moving off.  This thin crack seems to symbolize our narrow view of life, how, like Auguste and Valentine, again and again just missing each other, we go about our lives as if wearing blinders, seeing only a narrow slice of the world in front of us and missing what's going on right beside us.
Kieslowski left Karol and Dominique in a kind of perpetual hell of revenge in White, so perhaps there's optimism in their reunion at the end of Red.",1005609600,11,6731,4.686808510638298

663914,5,6303486762,"This third and final installment of Kieslowski's trilogy was probably the best story of the three with many people's paths unknowingly crossing and with excellent performances from Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Jacob plays a beautiful young model and student who has a long-distance relationship with a man who spends most of his time in England. He makes demands on her which don't seem particularly demanding, but which subtly make the audience realise that he thinks mostly of himself and not of her feelings. One night Jacob is driving and hits a dog in the road. She puts the dog in her car and takes it to a vet. The vet tells her the dog will be fine but that the dog is also pregnant. Jacob finds the owner, a retired judge played by Trintignant. He claims he does not care what happens to the dog, so Jacob takes the dog home with her (the dog's name is Rita, if that matters). Rita eventually escapes and runs back to the retired judge. Jacob and the retired judge form a very strange and ambivalent friendship, and Jacob discovers some unsavoury things about her new friend. For example, he has set up equipment in his home in order to eavesdrop on his neighbours's phone calls. He has discovered that the man next door is having an affair with another man but the family does not know. Jacob is furious that he violates their privacy and insists she will go next door and tell them everything. She is not able to, but after she leaves, he writes letters to all the neighbours and informs them of what he has done and in essence turns himself in. The relationship between Jacob and the judge deepens and takes new turns. He tells her a story from his distant past and hints that a similar fate may be awaiting her. The film is sensual, romantic, deceptive, full of mystery, suspense, humanity, betrayal and beauty. Definitely the best of the Red, White, Blue trilogy (also the last. The acclaimed director, Kieslowski, died not long after this film was released).",982800000,3,1984,4.639204545454546
663915,5,6303486762,"Every great director creates a sort of  myth around his or her work.  For  Kieslowski, his ultimate denouement finds its place in Red.  Red is the  third and final film in Kieslowski's Trois Colours  Trilogy and, in fact,  the last film  of his career.  It takes place in  Geneva, a city  renowned  for its neutrality and aloofness in an already very aloof and very neutral  country.  High in the Swiss Alps, the story concerns a young model and part  time student, Valentine, and a regretful and reclusive old judge, whose  name is kept a mystery.  Like in Bleu, the first film in the series, the  primary story begins with a car accident, as Valentine runs over the  Judge's dog.  When the Judge refuses to accept the wounded animal,  Valentine is forced to take the dog to the veterinarian.  When attempting  to return the dog once again after her  treatment, she discovers that the  Judge is spying on his neighbors with his radio equipment. Valentine cannot  bring herself to denounce the Judge, although she finds his actions utterly  reprehensible and a bit pathetic, and even takes part in the Judge's world  of detached moral condemnation by calling a man whom the Judge suspects is  a drug dealer (her brother being a drug addict) to curse at him.  From that  point, the Judge and Valentine engage in what at first is an ambivalent  relationship, but which slowly and intimately melts into an exchange of  fraternity.  The relationship grows closer as both make sacrifices for each  other and emotional revelations between each other, dredging up painful  memories, revealing long held secrets, mistakes, and vanities,  and  admitting misplaced or unrequited love.  The film ends in a tour de force,  as there is a fulfillment of Kieslowski's promise of liberty, equality, and  fraternity.",968112000,16,1799,4.902684563758389
663916,5,6303486762,"This is a sometimes clever, sometimes corny, but always beautiful story of predestined love.

Jean-Louis Trintignant plays a retired judge,  corrupted by an all-consuming cynicism, who meets a beautiful girl, but  doesn't fall in love with her.  Instead, his reincarnation does, and he  mystically orchestrates their predestined meeting.  The girl is played by  Irne Jacob, who is earnest, warm, uncorrupted and beautiful.  She's a  French model unloved by her boyfriend (fool that he is) with a demeanor  proud, but not vain, vulnerable, but not weak.

The judge is so pathetic  that he spies on his neighbors' phone conversations to spice up his lonely  and pitiful existence.  Their love affairs, their spats, their crimes are  piped into him as he sits alone in his house.  But she has the genius to  appreciate him and to understand him, and so frees him from his  bitterness.

We see in this, the final third of director Krzysztof  Kieslowski's trilogy, something reminiscent of his countryman, Roman  Polanski, in his passion for young actresses and his ability to bring out  the best in them.  We see further in the character of the retired judge a  projection of ideas about how an old man, past any pretense, might love a  young woman: wisely, delicately, from a slight distance, without a hint of  lechery.

Irne Jacob makes us believe that innocence and instinctive  goodness are wondrous qualities, regrettably not much touted these days.  More often depicted are women who would rather sing proudly of being  bitches while acting out violent, two-fisted, emulations of a bogus  masculinity, e.g., see ""Single White Female,"" etc.

Red is for her lips,  for the color of curtains and theater seats, for the color of her true  love's utility vehicle (often in her sight, but not yet recognized), for  doors and panels and for the warm beat of her heart.  Her name is  Valentine.  She is the dream of the worldly man who has known many women,  whose head is not easily turned.  And red is for the ringing of the phone,  heard in its urgency as red.

I liked this better than Blue or White, both  of which were very good; but the clash of innocence and cynicism here, with  youth and age so aptly contrasted, along with a clever plot (Kieslowski  loves to surprise us), highlighted by captivating performances from the  leads, make this the best of the three.

It is important that it is a coincidence, for  Kieslowski seems to be saying that so much of our lives is random and  beyond our control. This man and woman never knew they would meet, but  somehow they did.
We are unsure of what will happen to them. Will they  become friends? Will they ever see each other again? The story is very  subtle and poignant and completely unpredictable (unlike most Hollywood  films).

7848593,5,6303486762,"Three Colors: Red (1994) is one of those films that draws you in and never lets go. This film is one that leaves a small void in the form of being left to one's interpretation- that is, the symbolism that is sprinkled in throughout, not to mention lots of irony. What happens to an elderly man many years earlier happens to a young man in the present; how this all ties in is really the mystery element of the film. This approach works magnificently, because it makes the film very thought-provoking, rather than just a straight up mystery film. About halfway through the film, it dawned on me just how much a telephone plays a role, as there are numerous conversations via telephone. Does this have significance? I really don't know; perhaps I may see something the next time I watch this film. Yes, this film has replay value (one of my criteria for wanting to keep a DVD). Another thing that really stands out in this film is the soft-spoken dialogue by the characters, which I think makes the characters more powerful and the story a bit more compelling. I particularly liked the cloudy atmosphere and setting, coupled with the early spring weather, which gives the film a slight chill or darkness to it. Also, it becomes very obvious that the dominant aesthetic of the film is the color red, as it's seen throughout, and sometimes in an allegorical sense. This film is visually pleasing, along with having depth (as most art films do), the latter being its prime attraction. Because I don't speak French, I'm forced to use the subtitles feature to translate to English. At first I was a little concerned with this being a potential distraction, but it wasn't at all, as the dialogue moves at a modest pace. You have to give this film your undivided attention when you use the subtitles feature, but it's worth every minute. Fantastic acting, direction, settings, and a great mystery story with symbolism makes Red a great choice. Do not miss this masterpiece. The special features are very good and interesting, containing insights, commentary, interviews, behind the scenes, etc.",1475107200,,2085,4.794444444444444
7848594,5,6303486762,"What about this scenario:  God is bored.  He's down on earth, working as a judge (what else?), but he seems to have lost interest in that.  Even his omniscience -- listening to people's intimate conversations by tapping their phones -- is boring him to a point where he just fesses up to doing it and takes his punishment.  He has even lost interest in his dog and let's her run loose.  (You mean you didn't know that God had a dog!). She's hit by a car, driven by Valentine (Irene Jacob), who is preoccupied by wondering how to deal with a jealous, controlling boyfriend, who keeps calling her from England and who gets agitated when she's not there to pick up.  The dog, fortunately -- or maybe fortune has nothing to do with it -- isn't badly hurt but is discovered to be pregnant.  She has a collar, and Valentine drives her back to where she belongs.  Valentine and the judge -- Jean-Louis Trintignant -- have a conversation, and Valentine learns about his passing his time eavesdropping.  He walks with a cane and lives alone in a house that seems full of corners, passages, and a sense of clutter.  There's a fairy-tale look to it, and one wonders: is it Beauty and the Beast?  The judge tells Valentine a story about his life -- it seems to parallel the life of a young lawyer near-neighbor of Valentine's who is studying to take his judge's exam and whose girlfriend runs a personalized weather-report service that the judge uses.  But she takes up with another man, leaving the young lawyer (who passes his judges exam!) distraught to a point of almost abandoning HIS dog.  But when the older judge confesses to eavesdropping -- he calls the authorities on himself -- Valentine softens towards him and treats him considerately.  The dog has her puppies, and -- with an incredible and rather troubling final scene -- the film moves to an affirmative ending, at least for the young lawyer and Valentine.  Just in case you haven't seen the movie, I won't reveal the final scene.  But it's that scene that causes you to wonder about the judge and wonder whether even his original meeting with Valentine wasn't, in some sense, planned.

Trintignant and Jacob are wonderful, in parts that are not particularly complicated.  Jacob is the most beautiful and perhaps most humanely sympathetic of the ""Three Colors"" heroines, and the fairy-tale quality of the whole is enhanced by the palette and the cinematography, particularly of the interiors.  Like the other two ""Three Colors"" movies (""Blue"" and ""White"") it's a comedy.  A lot of critical ink seems to have been spilt on the philosophical depths of Kieslowski's trilogy, but it's more like Shakespeare than anything in the variety of its comic qualities, and like Shakespeare's comedies -- and Chekov's perhaps too -- these films are not without pain, but what makes them comedies are the ways that pain is woven into the different narrative and tonal contexts.  The ending of ""Red"" makes allusion to the other two movies as if to suggest that they have something in common, and I would call that a humane comic spirit.  ""Red,"" though, is the most heart-warming one.",1468800000,2,3122,4.753246753246753

This is a beautiful film  If not for the excellent performances, the film might seem corny, obvious, and predictable, but there is subtlety, and I admire its slow and inventive ways.  Valentine and her fellow meet - but off-camera, but you can just imagine the connection.  They are not smitten at the end, but you know a tragedy binds them.  You hope for the best.  As much as I like Valentine, and though I believe if August had met her first, he would have been forever smitten, I sometimes feel he is wondering about his first love.

But this is Valentine's story.  She is a model and a dancer, and her habits are so beautiful and natural.  She dances and gulps water like a fish.  She admits she nearly tripped during a modeling show.  She is wonderful and caring, and she is a careful good, very nice person, who is somehow linked to an intrinsic judge.

I love the film. I love layers, and especially the cinematography.  I love the connections.  How it all works in the end, though it shouldn't but you believe.  I can predict the end.  Irene Jacob is simply marvelous as the charismatic Valentine, and the wondrous thing is that she says so little in the film.
