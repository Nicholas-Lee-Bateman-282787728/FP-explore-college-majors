2800288,5,B000OVLBHQ,"Great quality writing and acting for a made-for-T.V. movie.  The movie took on the issue of gay marriage in an entertaining, non-threatening, non-stereotypical manner.  Hats off!",1244678400,,178,5.8076923076923075
2800289,5,B000OVLBHQ,"This movie is, of course, a fantasy. However it addresses some serious issues in a way that is fun and entertaining. I have been in a gay relationship for over 27 years and am not aware of having damaged anyone's marriage. I am aware that we had to go to a lawyer to get papers giving one another the right to visit one another in the hospital in serious cases. We talk a lot about the separation of church and state. The government here has confused the issue by giving church ministers civil authority over marriage. In some countries you get married by ""the state"" to satisfy the government; and, if you choose, you get married by your church to satisfy the demands of your religion. There is a lot of fun in this movie, but also some things to consider seriously.",1242259200,,767,4.408450704225352
2800290,5,B000OVLBHQ,"SUPERB IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE.  IT PUSHES THE IDEA OF GAY MARRIAGE DECKED WITH THE SAME COMMONPLACES THAT HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE IS PUSHED: WEDDINGS AS OSTENTATIOUS CONSUMPTION AND SPECTACLE.  JOHN STAMOS IS TRULY AWESOME, AS IS THE REST OF THE TOTALLY COMPETENT CAST.  KUDDOS TO THE DIRECTOR.  AND I AM GLAD THE POINT WAS MADE: MARRIAGE, AS A CIVIL CONTRACT, IS AS MUCH FOR THE LEGAL AND MATERIAL--READ ECONOMIC-- BENEFITS AS FOR ROMANTIC INVOLVEMENT.",1219190400,,449,5.027027027027027
2800291,3,B000OVLBHQ,"This movie is fairly unrealistic. Once you accept this premise, you can sit back enjoy it. Stamos' acting stands out among the cast whose performances are easily forgettable except the cameo by a female, DA office worker--she's hilarious! And although the plot is unbelievable, it flows rather smoothly. Those who like happy-ever-after movies should find this one delightful; it's extremely cookie cutter. But I give it a demerit for propagating too many ""gay"" stereotypes.",1200528000,3,473,5.405405405405405
2800292,5,B000OVLBHQ,"Loved this one it had a cool premise what if all the gays in all areas around the country went on strike.  How it affected the country was crazy and i know it wouldnt go down quite like that.  It was still nice to see people uniting over the issue of gay marriage and all that it entails.  John Stamos plays his character pretty well as well as Eric Dane.  His accepting (not really) of him being gay brother.  John Stamos is an all around delight to see in the movie being able to stand up for what he believes in.  When the issue of gay marriage gets put down by the governor that wasn't thinking that way before hand.  But it is an election year after all.

The supporting characters particularly his live in partner and Eric Dane's wife are acted well and having them in this helps lighten the mood somewhat. Not that is needed because the governor's wife is none too pleased with him after his decision and lets him know on any occasion she can.  I love that and i love the fact that while this is about gays marrying its also about a brother finally seeing and accepting his brother for who he is a gay man that wants the same thing he has...to be married.  It ends while like a few other movies i've seen still feels somewhat unique and stands on its own merits.

Loved the movie, storyline behind it and the overall appeal of each of the actors/actresses.  It is worth checking out and enjoying as well.  I bought and love it personally...with the recent string of gay movies that i've seen they've been too depressing and brooding. This has a message but it brings across that message through a mix of comedy and drama as well.

Job well done to all.",1191542400,6,1659,4.309677419354839

2800294,4,B000OVLBHQ,"The added features on this very entertaining DVD of the brisk and light comedy WEDDING WARS bear watching: the producers, director and actors make the case for the approach of this quality film in tackling the issue of rights for gay marriage in a manner that could not offend anyone and at the same time create a more serious vantage from which to view the controversy. It is the only time in the 'film' that politics is the issue, a factor that makes the actual viewing of the story far more powerful. Credit the writer Stephen Mazur and director Jim Fall for a creating a frothy, fun story that has much more at its core than just entertainment.

Ben Grandy (Eric Dane) works as the campaign manager for the Governor of Maine (James Brolin) and proposes to the governor's daughter Maggie (Bonnie Sommerville).  The wedding will be at the waterside mansion of the Governor and when the need for a wedding planner is raised, Maggie insists they ask Shel Grandy (John Stamos), the openly gay brother of Ben, who as a party planner has always dreamed of doing a wedding.  Shel is in a successful relationship with state prosecutor Ted (Sean Moore) who remains in the closet for career reasons.  Shel jumps at the chance to do the wedding, hoping that in some way this event will mend the schism with his big brother who has been distant since Shel informed him he was gay.  All goes well until Ben writes a speech for the Governor in which the Governor states he is against gay marriage.  Shel is stunned, gathers up his plans for the wedding and begins a private strike for gay marriage, a strike that with television and media coverage soon spreads across the entire USA, the result being the closure of beauty salons, florists, restaurants, limo services (and all the stereotype gay run businesses, unfortunately).  The crisis is ultimately resolved in a humorous yet very touching manner and to reveal more would diminish the impact for the viewer.

John Stamos is superb as the radical Shel, but everyone in the cast is completely professional - James Brolin, Eric Dane, Bonnie Sommerville, Sean Maher, Claire Welling, Sean McCann, Jane Eastwood, Linda Kash, etc.
The production qualities are polished, the story flows along at a fast clip, and in the end there are moments of truth that poignantly emphasize human rights to happiness for everyone. Would that there were more films of this caliber to deliver social comment without the preaching so often associated with message films.  It is a delight to watch. Grady Harp, June 07",1183161600,9,2536,4.771689497716895
2800295,4,B000OVLBHQ,"I just saw this movie the other day. A friend of mine had taped it. I found the movie to be very campy and funny. There were some stereotypes used in creating many of the supporting cast, but the Stamos and Maher were anything but. While there were some stereotypes used in creating each character, they were both well rounded, and in no way the cliche ""flaming over the top fag"" that tends to be created in most other comedies.

The movie has a great message, and one that I hope will actually be heard. I applaude A&E for airing a movie like this. It had a much wider audience than if it had been broadcast on one of the gay networks, or released only on DVD. I wish more of studios would take a stand and make movies with queer main characters, and have them be well rounded, and not cliches.

OH, and just on a side note, Sean Maher is still as hot as ever, even if he went from a doctor on a spaceship (Firefly-TV series) to an assistiant district attorney. Either way, he is always a great bonus to any show.",1179360000,46,1014,4.194871794871795

2800398,5,B000OVLBHQ,"I didn't realize how funny this movie actually was. A friend had given me a copy of a rerun on television. With all the editing that station did watching the DVD was like I was watching it for the first. John Stamos does a fine job portraying the younger brother who's hurt when his older brother doesn't seem to understand that he is looking for the same rights to happiness, not ""special privileges"". A comedic twist in today's events that's not ""in your face"" or preachy but yet leaves a lasting impression.",1416700800,,510,4.554347826086956

Alas, there was only one tiny kiss with his partner in this movie, but all the same it was an exteremely enjoyable film. The entire cast played their respective roles so well. It was filmed in a beautiful setting, by a lake, & James Brolin( Yeah, more ""eye candy"") plays the senator  who's daughter is affianced to Mr. Stamos's brother .

2800494,4,B000OVLBHQ,"I was wonderfully surprised at the quality and composition of this story.  Wedding Wars takes a light hearted comedic approach to an all too controversial but relevant issue in today's society, the right for gay people to marry.  Very engaging and entertaining, the producers explain in the brief extras feature that the story is basically a fable, a true to life story with some implausible elements meant to carry a message of importance.  I never found the movie preachy and I loved the way all the main characters were presented, no major villains here, just real humans with some differences in their beliefs.  Though some may object to the lack of resolution of the issues at stake, the story does resolve the wedding at hand, kindly and gently, and leaves the audience with perhaps some new insights to reflect upon.",1263340800,,823,4.857142857142857

8186894,4,B000OVLBHQ,"This is quite a fun movie where the daughter (Bonnie Somerville) of a politician (the governor I think) is proposed to by the politician's main political adviser.  They want a small wedding but the wife of the governor isn't having that, she wants a grand wedding with 4000 guests.  The soon to be groom's brother (Full House's John Stamos) is a party planner and his fiance pressures him in front of her parents to hire him.  His brother embraces the opportunity but when a political opponent starts his campaign (it's an election year) on creating state laws to block federal gay marriage laws, the groom writes a response speech for the governor.  The speech has the governor reassuring the public he will also be doing everything to block those laws when they are handed down.  The wedding planner then decides to picket the governor's mansion (where the wedding is to take place).  He's not getting anywhere fast, until the would be groom tries to hide him from the media.  Soon everyone is going to hear what he has to say, soon the state and nation will join his protest which will see gays walk off the job in support of  his cause across the US.

It's a movie that never takes itself too seriously.  Even the whole I'm suddenly learning some things about the guy I'm going to marry and don't like it side of things plot never really goes too deep.  I found the final scene with the governor to be a bit surprising considering the way the rest of the film was going.  It's a film more trying to entertain rather than preach or try and convert you to a side in the real life debate on the issue.",1465862400,,1602,4.4673539518900345
