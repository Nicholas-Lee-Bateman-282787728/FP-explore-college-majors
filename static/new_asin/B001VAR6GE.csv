8345888,4,B001VAR6GE,"It's not a major motion picture, so don't expect one. It's a TV mini-series and it plays like one.  Though the funny thing is it's cast with character actors whose faces you may recognize from major motion pictures (and TV). You know those faces you know but just ""can't place"".

Ah, Canada. Someone once said, there are only 15 actors in Canada. Well, all 15 are here.  Okay, maybe 13. Two of my favorites aren't.  (Steve Bacic and Douglas O'Keeffe)

Anyway, it's a decent movie with a good story. There are characters you will care about. And others you will want dead. And the pacing is good. Slow in some places, but nothing to be unexpected given the plot.

The other reviewer had one thing right - this is Canada's take on guns. But in watching it, you don't notice much difference from any major US city. That's until you pay attention to the details. Like, there's constant mention of crossing the border to Ohio. Personally, I was like, ""Ohio? Huh?""  Then there's the big one. At one point a cop says, ""5, 10 years ago, this would have never happened."" That is kids being caught in the crossfire and killed. Tragically, this has been something seen on US streets for decades.

All in all, a fairly good movie.

Oh, and so as not to seem biased. There are only 10 actors in New York and they've all appeared in Law & Order.",1263168000,,1331,4.444444444444445
