8507583,5,B00705R38K,I know that my son was very pleased.  He is a drummer and also gives drum lessons.  I would think he may recommend it to his students.,1377388800,,134,3.925925925925926
8507584,2,B00705R38K,Just not feeling it and having seen him play live I must say that I just wasn't moved..The disc is not up to the standard of the others available from Jazz heaven in my opinion...,1356739200,,179,4.142857142857143
8507585,5,B00705R38K,"I purchased the first three available drum DVDs from Jazzheaven (Harland, Hoenig, Peterson). This is a niche market and these videos are really unique -- please support their work! I found this video to be the most cerebral of the three, which surprised me given how specific Hoenig is in describing tuning, practice approach, and in his use of melody on the instrument. After seeing Ari play live several times -- and being somewhat overwhelmed by the experience -- it's great to see him explain the concepts in such an approachable manner. This video also differs from the other two (and from the live performances I've seen) in that Ari plays without accompaniment, yet it doesn't feel ""drummy"". Very inspiring.",1343520000,,714,4.958333333333333
8507586,5,B00705R38K,"The new DVD by Ari (and his playing) is simply jaw dropping good.
His unbelievable musicality and ideas are on full display, and he's sharing them in a very clear way.
Very nicely filmed w/ excellent sound, this is like a private lesson w/ Ari, very to the point and informative.
An interesting interview sheds light in his background and made it clear where he came from developing this unique approach.
I'm very inspired by this and can't wait to hit the practice room; this DVD definitely will open doors for new approaches on the drum set.
Highly recommended!",1332806400,,563,4.696969696969697
8507587,5,B00705R38K,"let me start off by saying that THIS IS AN INSTRUCTIONAL DVD (not a show off video...). I'm not the first nor the last to say that Ari Hoenig is a genius. I still can't get over on how effortless (even though at first it seems the opposite) he performs melodies, REAL melodies on a 3 pieces jazz set. Watching him shaping the melody of Bird's ""Anthropology"", was like witnessing Picasso painting one of his masterpieces. I follow Ari from his beginnings and I couldn't wait for someone to release an instructional video where he shares his UNIQUE approach on this concept. I really like the interview format: it reminds me of the old instructional videos of Dennis Chambers and Steve Gadd. Ari's student seems to get the right questions and Ari the right answers always throwing some extra content: this is definitively a bonus!! Ari picked up the sword than once was Max Roach signature weapon, polished it and sharpened it. Prepare yourself for many hours of productive and creative practice! Good Luck!!!",1328572800,,1007,4.793103448275862
