1651851,5,B00005QW9U,"This film, and the underrated talent Regina Taylor, does a great job of ""fleshing out"" Langston Hughes' classic short story. The film remains faithful to the Hughes tale and does an excellent job of giving the characters added depth. We see all of the elements that cause the bond between Cora and Jessie, the misunderstood daughter of her cruel and indifferent employers. The acting and Iowa scenery are superb. This is one adaption that does not require you to read he original first. Read it to compare, but see thins and it will really make you think of what's important in life.",1021939200,9,583,4.7254901960784315

1651862,3,B00005QW9U,"I love Regina Taylor (especially in ""I'll Fly Away"").  The movie is heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time - it is NOT a ""fairy tale"".  I thought it was OK, although when it ended I did feel as if a chunk of the story had been left out.",1368057600,,243,3.938775510204082
1651863,5,B00005QW9U,"I watched this movie a long time  ago but never forgot it, it stuck with me all these years. I like how Cora stood up for herself and Jessie. No matter how many times I watch it I always cry when Josephine dies especially with children of my own now. A great watch on how not to be like the mother and how to be a strong women and stand for what you believe in and for the people you love.",1367280000,,389,3.802469135802469
1651864,5,B00005QW9U,"In my opinion this film hits all the right notes. It is the film version of a story by Langston Hughes, and in my opinion everyone connected to it has taken all Mr. Hughes' points and fleshed them out beautifully. All the actors are perfect for their roles. It portrays life in small town Iowa during the depression with spotlight precision. There is humor, but most of the story is bittersweet and there are tragic events interwoven throughout just like in life. As you watch you can feel sympathy for Cora as she tries to find her place as a Black woman in a white community. This requires hiding much of what she thinks and feels. But as the story ends with the death of Jessie, the white girl she has loved, all the injustices Cora has witnessed burst through and she speaks her mind to a stunned gathering. I found much poignancy in this film.",1357948800,,848,4.4423076923076925
1651865,5,B00005QW9U,Every teacher would do well to show this in classrooms all over.  The director and actors did a wonderful job with a story that needs to be told.

1651867,5,B00005QW9U,"This is a story about the shame that binds us, and the truth that sets us free. It's about adolescent love, classism, racism, and a love that crosses all the boundaries.

Regina Taylor is a class act, and plays her characters with dignity and grace. Playing a woman who is fully expected to sacrifice her life for the family she works for, Ms. Taylor does as fine a job in this feature as she does in the TV series ""I'll Fly Away"" with Sam Waterston - one of my all time favorites.

When she loses her child to whooping cough, Cora's dedication to the little white girl she cares for, who was her daughter's friend, deepens. The story becomes more tragic as the true nature of the little girl's relationship with her own mother is based on the mother's shame, lies, and secrets. The way that shame plays out causes devastating effects to unfold until you just don't think you can take it any more.

And the power of the truth reveals how liberating honesty can be.

1651868,5,B00005QW9U,"I was drawn to the movie""Cora Unashamned"" because of some issues  present in my life.  I use movies as therapy.  They bring hidden situations to the surface where they can be healed.

The cast in this movie was excellent.  I learned something new about the story's author, Langston Hughes.  I always thought him a great poet, but this story proves his greatness all around.  He used his talent to point out social issues that needed to be addressed.  They are still present, unfortunately. However,they are not quite as severe as in those times.  It also pointed out historical facts that I'd like to study more indepth. Great movie. I'm proud to own it.",1120435200,5,654,4.716814159292035
1651869,5,B00005QW9U,"Almost all of the ""Masterpiece Theatre American Collection"" dramas have been disasters.  The sole exception is ""Cora Unashamed.""  This adaptation of Langston Hughes's short story is beautifully written, directed, and cast.  It packs a greater emotional punch than almost anything else that television has produced in recent years.
Cora, a black housekeeper, works for a well-placed white family in a small Iowa town, and loses her young daughter to illness.  Cora finds a surrogate child in the youngest daughter of her employers, and the daughter, in turn, finds a soulmate in Cora.  This friendship, as well as the young girl's romantic attachment, does not please her social-climbing mother.  Matters come to a head when this child also falls ill.
The underrated Regina Taylor plays Cora to perfection, displaying the full range of the character's emotions.  Cora's sense of humor, honor, and love balance her pain, hurt, and jealousy.  She never loses sight of the entire woman.  Cherry Jones, one of the New York stage's greatest actresses, matches her as the flawed and domineering mother.  Where a lesser actress would portray a cardboard villain, Jones displays all the vulnerability and humanity that lies under the surface.
A job well done.",1032393600,22,1250,5.236180904522613

Thank the Lord my caregiver was able to purchase it from Amazon brand new sealed for $12.88. The prices they are offering now $45.00 and up are a little too much.

Thank you and I do hope this review help someone.",1404950400,,463,4.435294117647059

7951204,5,B00005QW9U,"Now here is a great heart-felt movie. About the life journey of a young woman who is in service to a family. And the events in Cora's life with her daughter and daughter of her employer. Regina Taylor is wonderful in this movie. It's a believeable story and just so touching. A young black woman in a mostly white small town, who falls in love and is left with the joy of her life. In this movie it shows the wonderful, the good in some also with side by side with the uncareing and no heart. I saw this years ago and really like it, glad I found it for my own now. The tittle is right for the movie and tells how Cora feels and acts in her life. Unashamed to love and care. Some subject matter may not be good for children. I think teenagers(girls) though would really like this movie and appeals to different races also. It is mostly a woman's movie, no guns or car chases for sure. But a very thoughtful , heartfelt movie about life and how it affects mostly the choices women make.  I loved it, cause there is a saying in it, that touched my heart, being a parent also thinking back when my children were a lot of work. I won't spoil it, so you find out if the same words from Cora touches your heart also.",1378512000,,1210,4.127118644067797
