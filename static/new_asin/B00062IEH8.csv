8037499,4,B00062IEH8,"I purchased this movie years ago while traveling in Australia and to this day, whenever I hear a friend say, my kid skates, I hand them this movie. Not to strike fear in the parents hearts and have them stop the kids from skating but instead, to show them the iron wills of these guys as they get injured and just keep going. I cringe at the spills and crashes in this movie every time I watch it but that's what this movie is about. I'll say it again. The pain these guys experience and still get right back on their boards and try-try again is a testiment to the iron will of some of todays youth.
The soundtrack is pretty good as well.
The wisecracks from the interviewed skaters are funny as well. Even when they thank 411 for profitting on their pain, you have to laugh.
I wish it was still in print because my copy is beaten up from all the loaning and traveling I do and I need to reorder it.",1278892800,,899,4.142857142857143
