7222575,4,B00YIZWIFI,A rock solid action film with a couple dramatic twists and some surprisingly good character moments. The fights are a highlight. The photography is crisp and editing clear (no shaky cam). Definitely an underrated action film.,1439510400,6,225,5.277777777777778
7222576,2,B00YIZWIFI,"""How do you sleep at night. How can you do this?"" Nick Cassidy's (Lundgren) family has just been killed by an international criminal syndicate. His quest for revenge leads him to Thailand where he teams up with Tony (Jaa) a Thai detective who is investigating a human trafficking network. When they realize they are looking for the same group they join forces and try to put an end to the all of it. I have said before these are hard movies to review. Movies with Segal, Van Damme or Lundgren are essentially all the same. Same plot, same idea, same acting. This one is no different, either you like these movies or you don't. That holds true for this one. The biggest problem with this one is that is seemed like the middle part of a 3 part series. The movie opens to what feels like halfway through the actual story. There is really no intro to what is going on and you are trying to play catch up throughout. The way the movie ends felt like, we are out of money, if we can't get more funding we will end it here. There is still more that could have happened to tie it all up but it left you hanging. All that said, most people don't watch these movies for the story or acting and the action is decent enough to keep them interested. As for me, this is just another Lundgren movie. Overall, fans of Dolph will like this, otherwise I would avoid it. I give it a C.",1437609600,3,1366,4.237547892720307

What I will say is watching jaa run on buildings and threw alleys an negotiating obstacles ,makes me miss Jacky chan in his prime. Chan ability to move lightning fast through obstacle is second to none. Also the best secene was Michael jai fight scene ,he has a finesse and crispness to his techniques, though he makes me Bruce Lee,Donnie yen. But unfortunately like Donnie yen ,Michael jai white always gets shortchanged. Tony jaa fight scenes are decent ,worth buying for right price under 15",1462233600,,717,4.821138211382114

Nick, a tough NY cop, runs afoul of the Russian mob engaged in human trafficking, and they end up killing his wife and daughter for revenge. Determined to make them pay, he follows the kingpin to Bangkok, the hub of their activities. He teams up with a Thai detective and they decide to wipe out the entire organization and terminate their business entirely.

This is a great little action movie with plenty to offer, its really an action lovers wet dream in terms of the casting, for a smaller budget release movie it goes along way, the story is well put together and plays out well with some great performances from the cast, Tony Jaa is back to his best, great fight scenes with him versus Dolph Lundgren and Michael Jai White (what could be more cool) the action is great, plenty of decent budget bloody shoot-outs and fight scenes in great locations too, Lundgren looks great in this as does Jai White, the rest of the cast is good too, Ron Perlman is a great villain, if your an action fan this shouldn't be overlooked, a fast paced fun action movie that kicks ass!!",1451174400,,1081,4.51530612244898

7222648,4,B00YIZWIFI,"This is a story involving human trafficking from SE Asia to Eastern Europe and then the world. It is run by the evil Serbians who ""have no code."" Ron Perlman with an accent plays the bad guy. Tony Jaa is the good cop in Thailand. Dolph Lundgren plays the ugly cop from New Jersey who goes into a berserker mode as he seeks revenge against Perlman. He wears a hoodie while in Thailand to travel incognito.

That is pretty much it. Toss in the expected twists, some uncredited Thai girl extras stripper nudity, a few one on one fights, and an improbable chase scene (movie poster), Not to be confused with the Eric Roberts film ""Skin Traffick"". 3 1/2 stars. Don't expect a lot.

The story is contemporary and yet manages to fine plenty of time for action. Others have written what the story is about so I won't go into much detail about the plot. The scenery is fantastically shot with multiple interesting locations filmed to add to the action scenes. Lundgren plays a character that appears to be about his age, so this adds to the realism of the story I felt. Director Ekachai Uekrongtham keeps a fast moving pace while managing to hit all the major points of the stories. When I saw the cast of actors in the movie I felt it would be good and was not disappointed. Both Lundgren and Tony Jaa play similarly motivated characters from different perspectives.  Michael Jai White does well with his character, and his scenes with Tony Jaa are very intense.  Peter Weller and Ron Perlman round out the cast as supporting players in this well acted and action packed movie. Location, scenery, the cast made this a very enjoyable movie.",1440633600,11,1102,4.675257731958763
7222687,3,B00YIZWIFI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There is a genre of movie out there that gets plenty of looks but not always attention. These are the direct to DVD movies that show up in rental stores, online orders and rental boxes across the country. If they receive a box office release its such a soft release that most people will never know it happened. Many of these titles deserve to be released that way because they, well, stink.  But there are some that are actually pretty good. They just don't have enough oomph to draw in big numbers. SKIN TRADE is one of those.

Story wise were talking about the buying and selling of human beings, for the most part women, in various countries to be sold to buyers around the world. Here we have two countries involved in trying to put an end to this heinous crime. In Thailand Detective Tony Vitayakul (Tony Jaa) is on the hunt for a group of criminals kidnapping young women for this purpose. At the same time NYC Detective Nick Cassidy (Dolph Lundgren) is doing the same thing. Both are after the same man, a Serbian crime lord named Viktor (Ron Perlman) who runs the enterprise using his family in various locations.

Cassidy gets the drop on Viktor and his youngest son just joining the family business. In a shootout with the police, this son is killed while trying to prove to his father he is worthy of being involved. Viktor escapes and at the end of the day Cassidy goes home to his wife and teenage daughter. As he gets ready for bed he looks out the window and sees Viktors men shooting a rocket into his home, killing his wife and wounding him in the process. To make matters worse, Viktor kidnaps his daughter.

Not trusting the FBI who joined this operation and led by Agent Reed (Michael Jai White), Cassidy leaves the hospital and heads to the last known location Viktor was headed, Thailand. Tracking him along the way Reed alerts the authorities there including Tony. Wanted by both groups now, Cassidy tries to escape the airport after landing. A twist sets Tony against Cassidy leading to an impressive chase sequence through the streets and alleys of Thailand and ending in an all-out hand to hand fight sequence between the two.

Eventually the traitor is revealed and Tony and Cassidy begin to work together to take down Viktor and the human trafficking ring. Another top notch martial arts battle between Tony and another actor known for his martial arts skills (see, no spoiler there) is worthy of mention and watching. As the duo prepare to capture Viktor and the rest of his family wheels are set into motion that leave a sequel hanging.

The movie offers some terrific martial arts fighting sequences. While most will recognize Tony Jaa for this reason having starred in the ONG BAK trilogy as well as THE PROTECTOR 1 & 2, many may have forgotten that Lundgren holds a belt in karate. Their fight last long enough to near that of the famous longest fight scene ever between Roddy Piper and Keith David in THEY LIVE but not quite. It is still an impressive sequence.

The story holds up well enough and is actually better than some in this genre. The acting is less wooden than one would expect or that some have unfairly tagged several of these actors with. While their range may not take them into the realm of Shakespeare they do a decent job in their roles in films of this type and in other higher class projects as well. Made well, directed well and delivering the goods fans of action films like this seek, it makes this one of the better movies in the action genre. That makes this movie one worth watching.",1440547200,10,3601,4.563467492260062
8718399,4,B00YIZWIFI,Like this movie-enjoyed with son-Eliska.,1523491200,,40,7.2
8718400,4,B00YIZWIFI,"Three great actions stars in a decent gritty action movie. Not their best, but still more than worth the price of admission!

Okay, lets just set the tone right here.  Listen to the IMDB plot summaryit sounds like something from a gritty 1989 action movie: After his family is killed by a Serbian gangster (Ron Perlman; Hellboy 1-2, Pacific Rim) with international interests, NYC detective Nick (Dolph Lundgren; Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, The Expendables 1-3) goes to SE Asia and teams up with a Thai detective (Tony Jaa; Ong-Bak, Kill Zone 2, Furious 7) to get revenge and destroy the syndicates human trafficking network.

Its an interesting cast with many familiar faces. Nicks colleagues include Reed (Michael Jai White; Blood and Bone, Undisputed 2) and Costello (Peter Weller; Dragon Eyes, Of Unknown Origin, RoboCop).  Viktors lackies include Kong (Sahajak Boonthanakit; Hard Target 2, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li).

To call the dialogue extremely expository would be kind, it has all the dry over-explanation of a typical 80s or 90s action movie.  And in that vein, we have nudity, eastern European criminals with penchants for leather jackets and cocaine, sex slaves, and the classic one tough cop trope.  Our tough cop is Nick, and after he crosses paths with Viktor things spiral into an old Steven Seagal movie plot.  Much as in Hard to Kill (1990), Nicks home is invaded on the evening of his wedding anniversary, his wife is executed before his eyes, and then hes shot and left for dead as the house explodes. But Nick is wait for it Hard to Kill.  He somehow survives, wholesale murders every Serbian he can find, and sets out to turn this flick into a vigilante police revenge movie.

The action scenes range in quality from okay to pretty good, but nothing wowingnot considering the action star power behind it.  Tony Jaas first fight scene features some serviceable belt-fu, and Michael Jai Whites skills seemed sorely underutilized early in the film.  Im reminded of Kill Zone (2005), which outweighed its martial arts with police drama.  But, like any martial arts movie, the more significant fights come later.  And that they do in spades!

The Jaa-Lundgren fight was entertaining and definitely stepped things up with some Jaa stunts in a fight that merges the close-quarter stylings of Li-Lundgren (The Expendables) and Diesel-Johnson (Fast Five).  However, the overall execution of these scenes was technically lacking.  The action photography was just okay, often with the camera distractingly moving (mid-shot) amid fight choreographythe kind of camerawork better suited for chaotic wide-angle warscapes filled with tanks and explosions, but that obscures the finer fast-paced combat techniques from even a careful eye.

The subsequent editing was so choppy that, at times, it felt like six consecutive techniques might each have their own six cuts from six different camera angleswhich is fine for a Die Hard (1988) brawl, but a major flaw when hindering viewers ability to be wowed by Tony Jaas dexterous flair.  I cant help but to wonder if this wasn't to mask the agility-skill gap between Lundgren and Jaa. That said, Jaa has his moments (however less than he deserves) and the occasional several-second shot for an impressive combination of techniques flurrying his over-sized Swedish foe.

Though not as brutal or drawn out as the Jaa-Lundgren face-off, the White-Jaa fight offered richer exchanges of techniques.  Of course, this should come as no surprise.  Michael Jai White is outstanding as both a fighter and choreographer and delivers a sort of tough guy grace in his maneuvers.  I wish he had more screen time.

Director Ekachai Uekrongtham (Halfworlds, Beautiful Boxer) has achieved a very entertaining action film that strikes me as equal parts 90s-esque hard-R gritty mainstream crime movie and Asian martial arts flick.  The gunfights and chase scenes were passable (if were being nice), and the fight scenes seemed more limited by the experience of those behind the camera than before it.  But while this falls below our stars heydays of Rocky IV (1985), Ong-Bak (2003) or Blood and Bone (2009), it remains kindly recommended for fans of its three action stars.",1517875200,,4227,5.107558139534884
