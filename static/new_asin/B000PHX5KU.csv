2823386,5,B000PHX5KU,"Like previous reviewers, I too am VERY pleased that full season sets are now to be released.  But a word to Paramount - PLEASE DON'T release just one season per year!

The core audience for this series are now, or soon to be, senior citizens.  My father still watches this show on cable every day and he is in his mid seventies.  Odds are he will not live to get all 20 seasons if there is only one isssued per year.  My hope is you will release at least 2-3 seasons annually, as was the case with other great TV classics like The Andy Griffith Show.  All eight seasons were released in a 3 year period.",1178150400,7,603,4.155172413793103
2823387,5,B000PHX5KU,"I applaud this release of the entire first season of Gunsmoke on DVD, and hope the remainder of the best TV western ever made will also be released.

Gunsmoke, the longest running western in TV history (or TV drama for that matter at 20 years and 635 episodes), is complex and textured, dealing with mature themes and unforgettable characters that became part of our culture. It was billed as the first `adult western.'

I grew up watching the series, which debuted in 1955 as a half-hour black and white show then progressed to an hour in its seventh season, and began being produced in color in 1966.

The original opening depicted the Marshall in a fast-draw gunfight against a villain he killed, but this was toned down years later after groups complained of violence. As a result, rather than seeing the villain fall dead, the camera instead stayed only on Dillon as he drew his `peacemaker.' In the 70's, the opening eliminated the gunfight altogether and depicted Dillon riding quickly across the range. In the 1960's, early episodes of the series were rebroadcast as `Marshall Dillon.'

The much-honored and beloved show went off the air in 1975. Thirty-nine glorious black and white half-hour shows comprise this incredible set.

Few need to be told what his western depicted: It's the story of Marshall Matt Dillon (played to perfection by James Arness) who tamed the lawless Dodge City, Kansas, in 1873. He did so not only with his six-shooter but with his courage, sense of honor, justice and irreproachable integrity behind the badge.

A radio show predated the TV series and aired from 1952 to 1961. The radio Marshall was voiced by William Conrad (who later portrayed the lead role of the portly private investigator `Cannon' in the 1970's.) When CBS decided to produce a TV series, Conrad wanted the role, but wasn't chosen because of his girth. The rumor that western icon John `Duke' Wayne was offered the pivotal role of Dillon, but he turned it down and instead recommended his good friend Arness, has largely been debunked.

In addition to Dillon, the core characters are Miss Kitty Russell (Amanda Blake), owner of the Longbranch Saloon and Matt's long-time love and lover; the crusty but sensitive Doctor Galen Adams (Milburn Stone); and Deputy Chester Goode (Dennis Weaver). Burt Reynolds also had a recurring role as Quint Asper from 1962-1965. Ken Curtis replaced Goode as `Matthew's' Deputy Festus Haggen, who portrayed the loveable deputy who couldn't read from 1959 through the end of the series. Gunsmith then deputy Newly O'Brien (portrayed by Buck Taylor) moved to Dodge City in 1967 and remained until the show went off the air. Pat Hingle portrayed hard-nosed Doctor John Chapman for six episodes in 1971 when Milburn Stone left briefly for health reasons.

Arness and Stone remained through the series entire 20-year run, while Blake brilliantly portrayed the red-headed Kitty for 19 seasons.

Weekly guest stars represented the cream of the acting crop for decades! Here's an example: Bette Davis, Victor French, Morgan Woodward, Jack Elam, Denver Pyle, Jeanette Nolan, Jim Davis, Warren Oates, Jacqueline Scott, George Kennedy, Ed Nelson, Michael Learned, Forrest Tucker, Paul Fix, Slim Pickens, Bruce Dern, Harry Morgan, Steve Forfest, Richard Kiley, Beverly Garland and Leonard Nimoy.

Here are the episodes included in this boxed set: Matt Gets It (Debut); Hot Spell; Word of Honor; Home Surgery; Obie Tater; Night Incident; Smoking Out the Nolans; Kite's Reward; The Hunter; The Queue; General Parcley Smith; Magnus; Reed Survives; Professor Lute Bone; No Handcuffs; Reward for Matt; Robin Hood; Yorky; 20-20; Reunion '78; Helping Hand; Tap Day for Kitty; Indian Scout; The Pest Hole; The Big Board; Hack Prine; Cooter; The Killer; Doc's Revenge; The Preacher; How to Die for Nothing; Dutch George; Prairie Happy; Chester's Mail Order Bride; The Guitar; Cara; Mr. and Mrs. Amber; Unmarked Grave; and Alarm and Pleasant Valley.",1177632000,258,3967,5.098613251155624
2823388,5,B000PHX5KU,"After waiting so many years and being teased by three compliation releases, Gunsmoke is finally being released on DVD in a complete season package.

By releasing the first season of the show on DVD, Gunsmoke is finally being accorded the honor due it but first given to many other shows who didn't last as long and/or weren't nearly as good. The show didn't last 20 years without capturing the imaginations of a lot of viewers. Back in 1955, CBS thought viewers were ready to see an adult Western - one that was not created and written for kids, but one that intended to tap into the large audiences that were rushing to theaters to see Gary Cooper, James Stewart, John Wayne, and Henry Fonda on the prairie.

Casting Wayne protege James Arness as Dodge City, Kansas US Marshal Matt Dillon, Gunsmoke set the stage for all of the great television Westerns that came after it, like Bonanza, The Rifleman, Cheyenne, and others. First, the hero or heroes were stalwart, salt-of-the earth types that resonated humanity and virtuosity, like Arness' Dillon (and also set the stage for very tall leading men like Chuck Connors of The Rifleman and Clint Walker's Cheyenne Bodie). Next, stock the show with a spectacular supporting cast - Milburn Stone as Doc, Amanda Blake as Kitty, and Dennis Weaver as deputy Chester Goode. Add a weekly blend of terrific guest stars, throw in superb writing and directing, and the Western television series had its blueprint. And television had one of its best shows of any genre.",1177545600,84,1507,4.814671814671815

That's rare  , though I rather talk about this great first half of  Volume 1 which starts out with John Wayne giving his blessing . Now that's means a lot when you had the Duke say watch this show pilgrim or He will fill you full of lead ! To watch these early shows you see how young they were though Milburn Stone maybe wore makeup at first to look older  back then . These episodes were in B/W and only 30 minutes and the stories used were from the radio show . Also it always started out with Dillion up on Boot Hill . This show always had a very good production and the sets weren't cheap looking and shown dance girls walking off with cowboys and stories a bit more gritty  and more action than  say Bonanza and so many other Westerns on the air . Amanda Blake looked 25 and Arness was like 33.  As for Chester , He seem like a popular character , so popular He moved on to films and his own TV show . This show has many  famous Actors of that time  in guest star roles , some before they did get famous . One thing Im not happy with is CBS cutting seasons in half . This show went on for what 20 years . That part is a very big thing in this review is price for all 20 is the car payment for a luxury car of $800 . A lot of reviews I read said they are on fixed incomes an are upset . Back to the DVD ,Gunsmoke always was a very good show for two decades it entertained us till the show went off the air and another outlet for people to watch their old shows first on VHS then DVD.

2823468,4,B000PHX5KU,"I wouldn't say this was television at its best but many episodes have some interesting aspects to them.  This was not a series that I watched a lot of when I was growing up and I certainly have no memories of the earlier seasons so these episodes were all new to me (I was also surprised to find out that the series started as a half hour show).  At first there seems to be some stiffness in the acting.  Perhaps it took time for the lead characters to get comfortable with their roles or perhaps having the same person produce, direct and write the beginning episodes created problems.  There are some episodes that I had time watching (The Big Broad and Magnus) but many were also really interesting ones (The Guitar, Obie Tater and How To Die For Nothing).  For me, the ""Kitty"" character was the one most under developed.  In the first few episodes she seems too doe-eyed (especially with Matt Dillon).  She gets a little stronger as the season progresses but they don't really do much with the character.  Of course this is a western and it was the mid 1950's.  The show could only hint that there were things other than alcohol being sold at the Longbranch so it would be difficult to really deal with some moral ambiguities in relation to the female star (though the episode Reunion '78 touched on it with another character).  But still it was fun to watch season 1.  It is a TV western and certainly the US Marshall doing the right thing and using his gun for justice are predominant themes.  But there is also some darkness and complexity there.  And it is a real hoot to see these actors being so, so young (except for Doc).",1440374400,,1633,4.457912457912458

2823475,5,B000PHX5KU,"So few people are around who actually saw these episodes when they came out on TV, and they are really the best of the series.  The actors look so young it almost makes you want to cry.  There's an innocence to the era, despite the gunplay and violence.  Back in 1955 this new series was dealing with topics that TV shied away from for years to come - there's a reason these were shown at 10pm and listed as ""adult drama"".  The video quality is SUPERB!  After watching some of these old episodes as reruns and on YouTube I didn't think it could be possible for them to achieve the  excellence that they have on this DVD.

It was one of those series that could stand up to changes of characters over the years. However, I personally wanted season one, because the first episode was introduced by John Wayne. It was Wayne who was earlier approached by the studio to play the part of Matt Dillon. Though Wayne could not do the TV series, he did recommend James Arness ( a co-star in a couple of Wayne's feature films) for the lead part.",1412208000,,503,4.478260869565218

2823538,5,B000PHX5KU,"What can you say - one of the best classic TV westerns. The first season of Gunsmoke was a half hour B/W format. Episode 26 (Hack Prine) you will notice a few ""different"" things (the office and Long Branch are different). This episode was the pilot but for some reason they didn't show it until closer to the end of the season.  I enjoyed the fact the opening sequences are of Matt Dillon walking on boot hill and hearing his ""thoughts"". Enjoy some of the all time classic western characters - (of course) Matt Dillon, Miss Kitty, Doc, and most of all Chester.
The first season does NOT have English Subtitles for the hearing impaired.  39 episodes  Very entertaining show.",1403740800,,673,4.591666666666667

That is telling my age, but I think anybody born in the 50's would remember that.  Matt does not have the limp that he had in the later years, and that is something to get used to.  Chester seems to have a crush on Miss Kitty.  Doc is just as ornery as in the later years.  Totally enjoyable.",1403395200,,448,4.091954022988506
2823540,5,B000PHX5KU,Brought back memories of watching this with my father when I was a kid. This was a great and I think I appreciate more now that I am older.

2823541,4,B000PHX5KU,"I always thought Gunsmoke was at it's best during the half hour episodes. For me the hour long episodes sometimes seemed slow and over stretched. One of the joys of the first season is that James Arness gives an opening narration in some of the episodes, as Matt Dillon is seen walking around Boot Hill expressing his thoughts about his job as Marshall. Gunsmoke was not an action led western and this first season offers some thoughtful stories with each episode making good use of it's 25 minute running time. It was described at the time as an adult western which meant it was high on drama and sometimes low on action. But it was one of the first quality TV westerns which offered a wide range of stories instead of the ""shoot em up"" content of other westerns of the time. With a strong hero and colourful supporting characters, Gunsmoke broke the mould of TV westerns and this first season is worth viewing.",1403136000,21,912,4.567073170731708

It's been fun to watch the characters develop in this first season.  Mostly, I recall the hour-long shows when I was younger, and I had kind of a ho-hum attitude toward most of them.  These half-hour shows are often packed with action and drama whereby the later hour-long shows often seemed to drag.
I would recommend this set to Gunsmoke fans or to those - like me - will soon becoming Gunsmoke fans.",1400716800,2,523,4.602150537634409

2823547,4,B000PHX5KU,"""Gunsmoke"" stands out as one of the most popular westerns in TV history.  And it was different.  From the introduction by John Wayne before the first episode to the adult characters that inhabited Dodge City.  In other westerns the cowboys were too clean.  In ""Gunsmoke"" people looked like they lived on the dusty plains of Kansas.
The program was a ratings success for nearly twenty years, and its loyal audience stayed with it.  However, the audience grew too old over the years, and were thus less desirable to advertisers.  Although the show is gone, many of us will always remember Matt, Kitty, Chester and Doc.",1396051200,4,616,4.819047619047619

2823550,5,B000PHX5KU,With all of the meaningless new movies and TV series I sure I am not alone with a desire to see more entertainment like Gunsmoke.  The first of the series is introduced by none other than John Wayne.  Some of the regular actors are so young that you have to look close to recognize them.  You can notice that the actors were just beginning to acquire their acting skills as compared to older episodes.  You really must see the first season to appreciate the rest.,1393804800,3,463,4.411764705882353

2823554,5,B000PHX5KU,"In the mid 1800's on the dusty main-street of Dodge City, Kansas, a lawman and an outlaw face each other in a six-gun duel that only one of them can survive.  In 1955 John Wayne made a rare television appearance to introduce what was to become America's defining TV western.  In its first season Gunsmoke would break all  the traditional molds for the squeaky-clean lawman that always gets his man.  Instead what the viewers got was a gritty, sweaty, tour de force of the Wild West.  In Matt Dillon America found a tough, honest, lawman that could stand up to an angry mob yet knew when it was time to back down for the greater good.  With a stellar cast of relatively unknown actors the show boasted fine performances by James Arness, Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone and Dennis Weaver along with a strong supporting cast and host of top name guest stars.  People like Chuck Connors, Keye Luke, Charles Bronson and Sebastian Cabot make guest appearances in many episodes. The scripts were outstanding and ran the gamete from intense drama to light hearted comedy, with several done by future director Sam Peckinpah.  The story lines were just as diverse; a crooked sheriff's reign of terror in a small Kansas town, a bulling professional boxer out for revenge, the problems with Chester's mail-order bride.  Charles Bronson is outstanding as a serial killer who can't be stopped.  How far will Keye Luke go for revenge when two men cut off his queue?  Chuck Connors and James Arness square off in a fist-fight that's not to be missed.  Not all of the stories turn out the way you might think, sometimes the bad-guys just walk away and there are times when you're not sure just who is the bad-guy.  Gunsmoke had an incredibly long run as a top rated TV series and this first season will show you why.  If, like me, you grew up watching the show then this is a great way to revisit Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester for a reunion and a look back at how it all started.

2823575,5,B000PHX5KU,"I'm so glad to see Gunsmoke on DVD. I know it's been out for some 6 years now, but i'm not up to date with this new DVD technology stuff lol (I stuck to VHS tapes until about 3 years ago). I purchased season 1 because I never saw any of these episodes before. This is the debut season from 1955-1956. That's way before my time watching TV, but I swear to you I must have watched all of the colorized episodes in the late 60s and 70s. I recall some black and whites, but Festus was Matt's partner by then. I never saw this Chester character before on the show so this DVD is great start to getting into Gunsmoke. This season (and the next 5) are half hour episodes, something else I never knew. I grew up watching full 1 hour episodes. These half hours seem to fly by and get the plot in much faster, which I find interesting. The actors look so young in this one too. As it turn out, the series is now released in half seasons box sets, so I invested in a home-made version of the entire series (don't tell anyone!!!). This home-made set turned out great and it has all these older episodes too, so i'm through with these half seasons. Nonetheless, I have season 1 on store DVD. While i'd recommend a home-made set, many people would rather wait for the official releases, but I find them too expensive, though this is the only full season, so grab this one and then decide what's best for you.",1380844800,,1394,4.224719101123595

The first six (half-hour) seasons are great.  A lot of story was packed into about 25 minutes, by the excellent writers.  It is also fun to see great western character actors no longer living, besides the all-deceased main cast, itself.  I liked the first season a lot, but, so far, each subsequent season has been just as good and varied.  It is interesting that Ken Curtis appeared as a guest in many of the episodes as different characters, starting with Season 4, before the Festus character appears in Season 8, and becomes a regular in Season 9. After Roy Rogers, Range Rider, and such shows, Gunsmoke must have been a shock to 1955 audiences, with tough characters, good and bad, people dying or getting killed who you would want to survive, and no pat endings.",1364342400,,921,4.761006289308176

What some don't understand is that this was meant as an adult western, but according to today's standards, even kids can watch it.  There is plenty of drinking in it, but even that is nothing compared to what things are today.

Chester, Doc, and Ketty are just as important as Matt Dillon.  Though he gets top billing, he wouldn't be anything without his supporting cast!  There are several great episodes in this episode.  Matt gets shot in the very first (and many times after that)  The music is GREAT.  Chester has a wonderful personality.  These episodes stand out to me:
Matt Gets It
Home Surgery
Obie Tater
Smoking Out the Nolans
Magnus
Chester's Mail Order Bride

There was also one where a couple bad guys try to string up a slow man.  I can't remember the name of it, but it was another excellent episode!

2823614,5,B000PHX5KU,"I always know what one of those things would be; a set of the *entire* series of the show Gunsmoke. Yes, I know that a complete set of ALL the episodes does not exist at this time and yes, I know that this wish also implies a means to watch it, electricity or batteries, etc, but just go with me on this one for a minute, k?

I only started watching Gunsmoke a little more than ten years ago. As it happens, by NYC parenting standards I was a little strict with my kids about t.v. content and so after supper we'd have family t.v. time and watch Little House on the Prairie. When we'd exhausted all the aired episodes of that on TV Land, as a slight variation on the theme we decided to watch Gunsmoke. This was no little house on the prairie; this was a whole different side of the west. The untamed part. The part watched over by none other than U.S. Marshall Matt Dillon. From my first episode was I hooked - simply put, James Arness plays this role to utter perfection.

I had only seen the years aired on TV Land up until a couple of years ago, but when those became reruns for me I got a Netflix subscription to be able to see more of the series. If you've only seen them in color or the later years on t.v., these first episodes in the series are startling by contrast. Visually the black and white images+filming techniques have a unique dimensional quality that the color does not. If you remember those those 3-D postcards when you were a kid and how it looked like you could fall right into them, that's the *feeling* I got when watching that first episode in black and white. In the first episode you'll see Matt on his horse by a tree looking down on a posse below - this image is an example of this 2D/3D effect. Literally gives another dimension to enjoying the program.

Then, there's the stories.... the characters.... the acting.

I could go on here but we've all read (or could read) the synopsis and lengthier reviews. I won't go into a lot of detail because others have said it better than I could but I will add my two cents.

Opie Tater - an episode not to be missed and IMO, this episode is quintessentially Gunsmoke. Of the 20 years worth of episodes, honestly, I've seen about 14 years worth and this one definitely stands out among my favorites as having the essence of what the show is like, what it's about, and the standards of story and acting to expect.

Again, could go on here too but with twenty years of programs, that's a lot of waxing poetic and that time would be better used by actually seeing an episode or two.

I can't recommend the series enough. What better way than to begin at the beginning with the first season.",1328313600,4,2660,4.308
2823615,5,B000PHX5KU,"Bought these for my husband.  Good price, great shipping time & my husband is extremely happy with both of the Seasons I bought.

2823616,5,B000PHX5KU,In reviewing the reviews on this series I was torn about getting the 50th anversary one or the 1st Season.  I am not disappointed with the first season.  My parents had talked about John Wayne introducing GunSmoke and his friend James Arness.  So far the shows seem to be in order even being black and white they are great. Would recommend this show to anyone who appreciates a good western story.,1315872000,4,397,4.563380281690141
2823617,5,B000PHX5KU,"Good questions! I have some too based on the first season episodes.

How come Matt handcuffs a bad guy but doesn't bother to cuff him TO some object, thereby allowing the prisoner to conk him on the head and try to escape?

How come he sometimes leaves his empty office unlocked, only to return and find some stranger sitting at his desk, with ready access to a rack full of rifles? (Sure, there's a lock on the rack but, seriously, how hard would it be to shatter that lock?)

How come he gets shot in the gut more than once and seems to shake it off like the proverbial ""flesh wound""? Sure, the writers might want to have him get shot once in a while for dramatic effect but maybe it would work better if he got ""winged"" in the arm or leg with a ""thru-n-thru""? Gut wounds in the Old West were pretty dangerous, especially Doc Adams has to dig the slug out of your chest!

How come Matt's got so much time to wander around Boot Hill?!

Why was poor ole Chester never deputized? Wouldn't that have made his ""job"" (whatever it was!) much easier, especially when he's ostensibly ""in charge"" when Matt's on one of his mysterious week-long trips ""out of town""?

When I had only seen the later hour-long episodes, I used to wonder why Matt never settled down with Miss Kitty; indeed never even kissed her. Now that I realize she started her days as a saloon prostitute, I have a better understanding!

How come Dodge City citizens have such a pro-Confederacy bias that some of them want to hang a Yankee veteran passing through? Kansas entered the Union as a free state and Kansas military veterans served in the Union Army. Dodge City itself wasn't even in existence until after the Civil War.

How come Matt pays for everything with one coin, looks to be a silver dollar, from his shirt pocket? Does everything cost a dollar, or does he round up everything to a dollar leaving the change as a tip? One episode seems to indicate he was paid $100 a month. A U.S. marshal was probably paid decently, so say a modern lawman makes at least $50k. If that's comparable in buying power, Matt Dillon's silver dollar is worth 40 of today's dollars. 40 bucks for a shot of whiskey and a beer for Chester?? 40 bucks for two plates of eggs & biscuits? I guess Matt was a classic Ole West ""Big Spender!"" (A lot of Westerns seem to play it very loosely with the comparative buying power of the dollar. Check out the wanted posters in and outside Matt's office. The ransom on one bad guy is $2000! That's almost two years of Matt's pay. He'd be better off resigning and tracking down ""owlhoots"" for the reward money, if being a U.S. marshal wasn't in his blood!)

Fun to raise questions like these but it's all in fun. Gunsmoke is a great show and I'm looking forward to receiving Season 2 in the post!",1302825600,3,2783,4.398832684824903

So, I just discovered this outstanding collection and made it a Christmas gift. What a fantastic show, great cast and scripts of what evolved into a truly adult western where the cast tackles all sorts of issues, many of them social and from folk all sides of the track, poor, rough, rich etc. And they portray some pretty rough charcters from the fringe of the western frontier that confront the folk in Dodge with Matt, Kitty, Chester and Doc.

2823623,5,B000PHX5KU,"So far, I have only watched 3 out of the 6 discs and it has been a pleasure.  I always preferred the 30 minute version of Gunsmoke to the 1 hour version that came later in the series.  I enjoy Dennis Weaver as Chester Good.  This is a show that my father and I watched every Saturday evening for several years.  It came on at 10 PM and was followed by a 30 minute show called ""Highway Patrol"" with Broderick Crawford.  My Mom was always fussing because it kept me up late on Saturday evening and she said it made me cranky when she was trying to get me ready for Sunday School and church the next morning.  My Dad always defended me, saying, ""Has she ever missed a Sunday School lesson or a church service because she was tired on Sunday?"" And, the answer was always no.  This 1st season of Gunsmoke has been a delight for me.

2823625,5,B000PHX5KU,"John Wayne and James Arness on the same DVD! This DVD is a gem. Today's writers could learn alot from these old episodes. I enjoy the humorous lines and idioms...""say it plain"". I had not seen the earlier Gunsmoke episodes.  Viewing them has provided much needed background information about the characters and Dodge City. I was surprised, but not disappointed, to see how aggressive Matt Dillion was in the early days. He was pretty violent, but I guess he had to be in town such as Dodge. Matt's comments were also pretty tough. He did not accept any nonsense. Miss Kitty's way of dressing and her transformation from saloon girl(bare shoulders, ankles, lace boots) to saloon owner (long sleeve blouses, long skirts) is interesting.

I appreciate the opportunity to purchase these DVDs from secondary sources.  I plan to begin a collection and the prices make it more affordable.  The quality is superb.  Thank you.",1268870400,3,917,4.928571428571429
2823626,5,B000PHX5KU,"Bonanza has always been my favorite series from the golden age of TV westerns. But I've recently been watching the middle-period b&w hour-long episodes of Gunsmoke on the Encore Westerns channel, and I'm now hooked. So, I figured I should check out the very first season--and I have NOT been disappointed. James Arness stands tall in more ways than one as Marshal Dillon, and the supporting cast (especially Milburn Stone as Doc Adams) is fine as well. As with Bonanza, awesome guest star performances are the norm for Gunsmoke. But what sets this show apart for me is the quality of the stories, making most episodes intriguing and unpredictable. This 6-disc set is awesome. Period.",1267056000,3,683,4.947826086956522

2823633,4,B000PHX5KU,"First of all, I need to say that I like western movies and television, with all their hokey conventions.  And in comparison with other TV westerns of the period, this one was very good.  There was something downright comfortable about it.  But there are a few things that I con't quite understand.

What exactly was Miss Kitty's source of income?  She wore some pretty fancy low cut gowns.  Was she a ""soiled dove,"" in the parlance of the Old West?  Was she Matt's main squeeze or did she go upstairs with any of the boys who had the price, like Laurie in ""Lonesome Dove?""

Why was there never any horse manure in the street?  And how did they keep those streets unrutted with packed sand?

How come the town and the Long Branch Saloon didn't look anything like the pictures of Dodge City from the 1800s?  The real Long Branch was a narrow and dark hole of a place.

Why doesn't the countryside around Dodge look anything like the topography and flora around the real Dodge City?  The plants we see appear to be more native to California than Kansas.

Oh, there are just lots of questions, but these will suffice.  The answers have to do with what viewers and censors would tolerate when this series was made, and with where studios could film.  The Dodge City we see here is an idyllic place, a place of myth, of the imagination, not of reality.  Had they stuck with stark reality, people wouldn't have watched.

So accept ""Gunsmoke"" for what it was:  how we wanted the west to be.",1237248000,4,1482,4.462686567164179

2823635,5,B000PHX5KU,"We've been pleased with the quality of these dvds: crisp black and white and good sound. And of course, Gunsmoke itself is some of the best television ever: taut plots, nuanced character studies, solid acting, careful attention to detail in the sets and costumes. I feared watching these old shows might be an exercise in nostalgia that would become boring, especially compared to today's rapid camera cuts and lavish production values, but I was wrong. They're as exciting and compelling as when my family first watched them. The human interest angles and the personality types these shows explore are still with us.",1231200000,8,617,5.0588235294117645

2823638,5,B000PHX5KU,"The television series ran from September 10, 1955 to March 31, 1975 on CBS for 635 episodes. Until 2005, it was the longest run of any scripted primetime series with continuing characters in American primetime television.

Conrad was the first choice to play Marshal Dillon on TV, having established the role, but his increasing obesity led to more photogenic actors being considered. Losing the role embittered Conrad for years, though he later starred in another CBS television series, Cannon (1971-1975). Denver Pyle was also considered for the role, as was Raymond Burr who was ultimately seen as too heavyset for the part. According to a James Arness interview, John Wayne was offered the role, but wouldn't do it; Wayne was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, and at that time, working in television was seen as a huge step down in prestige for a star actor.

In the end, the primary roles were all recast, with James Arness taking on the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon upon the recommendation of John Wayne, who also introduced the first episode of the series; Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode; Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. Galen ""Doc"" Adams; and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell, owner of the Long Branch Saloon. MacDonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer. Arness, in his role on Gunsmoke, achieved what no other actor at the time had ever matched: he played the same character on the same scripted series for 20 years - at the time the longest uninterrupted period a primetime actor had played the same role in the same show.

In 1963, singer/character actor Ken Curtis did a guest role as a shady ladies' man. After Weaver left the series to venture out as the lead in his own TV series, Kentucky Jones, Curtis was added to the show's lineup. He played the stubbornly illiterate Festus Haggen, a character who came to town (in an episode titled ""Us Haggens"") to avenge the death of his twin brother, Fergus Haggen, and another brother, Jeff Haggen, and who decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially existing on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus Haggen was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick to Matt Dillon and was eventually made a deputy. Interestingly, his twin was never again mentioned on the show. In the episode ""Alias Festus Haggen,"" he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a comic relief episode (""Mad Dog""), another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. Other actors who played Dillon's deputies for two and a half to three-year stints included Roger Ewing (1966-1968) as Thad Greenwood and Burt Reynolds (1962-1965) as Indian/white Quint Asper. Buck Taylor, who played gunsmith Newly O'Brien from 1967-1975, also served as one of Dillon's deputies.

While Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly had a close personal relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002 Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, ""If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with."" The nearest that Matt and Kitty had to a romantic encounter was in a comic episode (""Quiet Day in Dodge""), where Matt, tired from a long day of settling disputes, was about to have dinner with Miss Kitty. However, she was distracted and found poor Matt sound asleep. Kitty ended up storming out of the room, furious. In another episode (""Hostage!"", Season 18, Episode 13, December 11, 1972) Kitty was gravely injured. Matt spent hours at Kitty's side in Doc's office, holding her hand before she stirred and he knew he would not lose her. The Marshal took off his badge to pursue the bad guy as a personal vendetta. When Kitty awoke and Doc told her of Matt's mission she feared for his safety. As Doc reassured her, ""The sun hasn't come up on the day that Matt can't take care of himself,"" Kitty answered, ""I couldn't live without him.""

In an episode (""Waste"") featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist ""at the law's discretion"" (meaning the Marshal's).

The character Miss Kitty was written out in 1974, when Blake decided not to return for the the show's 20th (and final) season.",1222819200,3,4480,4.759330759330759
2823639,5,B000PHX5KU,My father grew up watching gunsmoke and I thought it would be another hokey cowboy show.  I was pleasently surpised to find out that it was very well written and full of life lessons applicable to anytime and place.,1215302400,,215,4.512820512820513

2823641,5,B000PHX5KU,"""GUNSMOKE"" premiered in 1955 and was canceled in 1975, for a total of 20 seasons and 635 episodes. It is one of the best, if not the best, television series of all time. Originally, it was in the black and white half hour format, then it went to black and white full hour, and finally to the beloved color full hour programming. The episodes in color are probably the best known to today's audiences. But I guarantee you that the episodes from the original black and white programming are just as good, and the first season is no exception. This great show also had an excellent cast. James Arness was Marshal Matt Dillon of Dodge City, Kansas, Amanda Blake was Miss Kitty Russell, a prostitute at first, and then later the full owner of The Long Branch. When the show first started out, Kitty was just a madame, or, as the show so cleverly disguised it, a ""saloon girl"". Over time, the many fans of the show began to see her profession as awkward, because how could she work in the saloon when there was a certain special relationship between her and Matt? Since the show was so strongly devoted to its fans, the writers changed Miss Kitty to at first half owner, and then later, full owner. However, the show never took Kitty and Matt's relationship to a higher level. It would be strange to see Marshal Dillon come home to a house full of kids, now wouldn't it? Also in the main cast were Dennis Weaver as Chester Goode, and Milburn Stone as Galen ""Doc"" Adams. Chester was not a deputy, but more of a helper to Matt. He was best known for his straight legged limp and his high pitched cries of ""Mr. Dillon"". Doc was a crusty and cantankerous old coot on the outside, but had a very good heart on the inside. The constant friendly badgering between Doc and Chester was always hilarious, so much that they eventually became somewhat of a comedy act. Unfortunately, Weaver left the show in 1964 to pursue other things. This is when the newer and more familiar to modern audience age of ""Gunsmoke"" was ushered in. When the show brought in Ken Curtis as Festus Haggen in 1959, Roger Ewing as Thad Greenwood in 1965, and Buck Taylor as Newly O'Brien in 1967. But I am not picky, and love any episode just as much as another. I shall look forward to all those episodes, some of which I have never seen. Other wonderful characteristics of this show were its impeccable use of guest stars, and transitioning the Western genre from the old serials of the 1940's to the adult Western. This show was actually the first adult television Western. The writers and producers attempt was to break away from the cliche-laden Lone Ranger to the realistic West. No masked men found here! The first season of ""Gunsmoke"" did not feature as much as it would later in the way of special guest stars, because it was just viewed as another Western. However, this first season did have several guest stars, such as John Dehner, Royal Dano, Aaron Spelling, Charles Bronson, and Strother Martin. The guest stars can be found more abundantly in later seasons, but it did not take long for the producers to realize the jackpot they had found for television.

2823642,5,B000PHX5KU,"I would highly recommened this 39 episode set to all Gunsmoke fans. James Arness seems to be more involved in these episodes than in later years. Many actors performed in these episodes who later became well known on their own. I hope they come out with another similar set like this, with more new episodes from the 50's & 60's. Excellent B & W picture quality and easy to navigate format.",1207440000,,390,4.507042253521127

2823644,5,B000PHX5KU,"This was my favorite T.V. Show in the 50's hands down. I watched it every Saturday night ( followed by Have-Gun Will-Travel, my second favorite show HA HA ). I have to tell you that while Gunsmoke was always a quality series, the early shows were by far the best. I watched this and it brought back so many memories, but even if you've never seen it, it's well worth watching. Marshall Dillion was one bad man to tangle with !",1201392000,,426,4.271604938271605
2823645,5,B000PHX5KU,"My husband and I remember when Gunsmoke first came on TV as a series - it was originally a radio drama.
Watching this First Season DVD was pure fun and occupied many evenings because there are 39 1/2 hour episodes.
We enjoyed watching for actors who later became stars and reading the credits.  Sam Peckinpah wrote several
of the screenplays.  And how the characters and story lines developed over the long life of the series was
interesting too.
The few Extras were fine but there are not enough of them.  Perhaps future DVD's were have more.",1199577600,,543,4.635416666666667

2823647,5,B000PHX5KU,"I grew up watching later seasons of this classic series - the hour-long colour seasons with Festus as deputy - so I was a little nervous about buying this unknown Gunsmoke. There was no reason to be concerned.
This first season is great. I look forward to buying more FULL-season releases when CBS comes back to its senses and releases them that way again.",1197331200,4,356,4.578125

I loved the show. I didn't know if I would like the half hr b/w. I got this set and I am loving it. They pack quite a nice story in 25 minutes. I found it took a few episodes for the characters to develop and really become strong.
  The quality is really good, nice dvd case and pic of the four main characters.
  Gunsmoke was one of my favorite shows, and now I get to see it from its beginnings. The stories are good, and not just simple shoot em ups. A lot of them are good character driven shows with moral and social issues.
  Keep them coming, the first half of season 2 is comming in january, I am buying it, and I hope it sells well so they keep putting out new seasons.",1193616000,2,750,3.966666666666667
2823650,5,B000PHX5KU,"One of my favorite bits of trivia about this show is that when it aired in 1955, my pop was 5 years old. When it ended its 20 year series run in '75? I was 5 years old. So up until this set and the 50th Anniversary set were released, I had only seen the color episodes that they show on TV Land which were from 1966 'til the end. So not only did I get to see Marshall Dillon, Doc, and Kitty (all MUCH younger), I also got to finally see Matt's original sidekick Chester! LOL I was so used to Festus from the color eps. A lot of recognizable actors in this first set as there were in the later seasons like Chuck Conners (The Rifleman), Charles Bronson, Strother Martin, and even Aaron Spelling as a dopey guitar player. The half hour format also took some getting used to.
The 1st ep. was introduced by the Duke himself, John Wayne. Cool stuff for some one who's only been watching the color eps on TV Land for a few years.",1193270400,2,923,4.104972375690608

2823653,5,B000PHX5KU,"Saddle up for Gunsmoke: The First Season, the start of the longest running dramatic primetime series featuring continuing characters in history. Set in Dodge City, Kansas, the series stars James Arness as Marshall Matt Dillon, a tough but fair lawman. The cast also includes Milburn Stone as Dr. Galen Adams, Dodge City's ornery but caring physician; Amanda Blake as Miss Kitty, glamorous proprietor of the Long Branch Saloon; and Dennis Weaver as Chester Goode, Matt's oddball deputy who walks with a limp.

In the first season, each character is given his or her own moment in the spotlight. Doc is forced to make a deal with a gang of murderous kidnappers to save his own life and continue caring for the town (""Word of Honor""). He goes against a medicine man whose magic elixir proves to be deadly (""Professor Lute Bone""). He even turns detective to discover the source of typhoid (""The Pest Hole"").

Miss Kitty comes to the aide of an accused cattle rustler, but later doubts her judgment (""Helping Hand""). She becomes a murder suspect when a rancher with his sights set on marrying her turns up shot (""Tap Day for Kitty"").

Chester is mortified when his ""uncivilized"" brother Magnus shows up in town for Christmas (""Magnus""). (This episode is filled with many fine comic moments, from Magnus dancing like an overly enthusiastic kangaroo to his proclamation to Miss Kitty ""I've never seen an animal as bee-you-ti-ful as you."") Chester also becomes betrothed to a mail order bride...by pretending to be Matt (""Chester's Mail Order Bride"").

The series is realistic in its way-when it's hot, people sweat, including the women. Yet it is also highly presentational and theatrical. Perhaps because of its roots on the radio, the series can also be long on talk and short on action. It is definitely of its time, but fans of early westerns won't want to pass it up.

The thirty-nine episodes that make up Gunsmoke: The First Season are divided onto six discs. All six discs are housed in what, from the outside, appears to be a standard DVD keepcase. Two interior swinging arms hold two discs apiece. The two remaining discs are affixed to the interior front and rear covers. Even with all six discs jammed into such a small space, viewers do not have to remove one DVD to get to another-each DVD is individually accessible. This packaging is a terrific space saver, allowing a six disc set to take up the same amount of room as a single movie.

There is one tiny inconvenience, but the space-saving capabilities of the set override it. The keepcase is clear, allowing the double-sided coversheets show through to the inside of the case. The interiors feature episode titles, original airdates, and brief plot synopses. Because discs one and six attach to the interior front and rear covers, the discs must be removed in order to read the episode guide. Really, though, this is a small price to pay for gaining room on your DVD shelf.

The static menus are functional. Viewers can choose to play all episodes on each disc consecutively or individually. There are no scene selection menus, but chapter stops are included.

Video and Audio
These episodes are grainy but mostly clean. You may be surprised at just how good they look.

The episodes are closed captioned.

Extras
Disc one contains ""Sponsor Spots"" (1:55) for L&M Cigarettes and Remington Shavers. The cigarette spots feature testimonials from Arness himself, in character with Doc (who proclaims ""you're really living"" when you switch to L&M). The spots are preceded by contemporary disclaimers stating ""This material is presented in historical context. We do not recommend smoking as it may prove harmful to your health.""

Summary

2823658,5,B000PHX5KU,"I can't say too many great things about this set--I am absolutely in heaven over the chance to see these again and with such quality. I was 5 years old when this first aired. We watched them on the 1st tv my parents ever bought, a Firestone table model that came from the Firestone store in Ft Walton Beach Fla. The reviews posted here before the set's release reminded me of the early introductions with Matt walking through Boot Hill. I hadn't thought abought that in years but it was just like I remembered. I have too many thoughts to share concerning the series but some of the high points or surprizes for me are:
  -Though the episodes don't seem to have been aired in the same order as filmed, it is interesting seeing the evolution of some of the main characters.
  -Has anyone else noticed that the 1st episode on Disc 5, ""Hack Prine"", looks different and maybe is the pilot? Check the differences in the exterior and interior shots of Matt's office and the interior of the Long Branch. These are both different from every other episode.
  -In the episode with Aaron Spelling, ""The Guitar"", a gentleman appears to be the owner of the Long Branch but he is never mentioned again in this season. I thought the owner was never mentioned, at least not before Kitty became the owner. Of course, I'm not an expert on Gunsmoke history.
  -Enjoyed seeing many of the ususal and not so common guest stars of the day but really enjoyed the bigger surprizes like Dan Blocker as the Army Lt in the last episode of the season and the aforementioned Mr Spelling.
  -Loved the episode, ""Yorky"", that shows the origin of the buckskin horse Matt rode for so long. Again, because the episodes seemed to have aired in random order, he is not always on the buckskin later in the season.

I can't wait for the rest of the half-hour seasons to be released. Now if CBS would just get back to releasing the rest of Have Gun Will Travel all will be right with the world",1188604800,3,1954,4.46067415730337
2823659,5,B000PHX5KU,"This can truly be said for pretty much every episode of Gunsmoke. I don't recall any bad ones, and I'd say that I have seen most of them. Sure, there are some episodes that are slower than others and don't have as much fighting and shooting, but they are good in their own way and have something for everyone. Personally, I prefer the fighting and gunslinger showdowns. I never understood the story behind Chester's limp, and I surmised that must have been an old war wound or something, as he mentioned being in the military. Maybe he got it in the ""Civil"" War or something. They should have all been released on DVD long ago. I heard this was my Grandpa's favorite series of all time. Unfortunately, he only got to see a few seasons, since he was killed in a 1961 coal mine explosion before I was even born. I beg to differ with the person who said that the series should have been retired after 1966 or 1967, stating they were ""boring"" and ""unwatchable."" (!) I just wonder if they have seen ""Mannon,"" as well as many others.

And what a pleasure it is to see ""Kitty"" (the lovely Amanda Blake), ""Chester"" (Dennis Weaver), and ""Doc"" (the crusty Milburn Stone) in glorious black and white -- the way westerns should be enjoyed on the screen.  And what a lineup of western icons as guest stars!  John Dehner (""Left-Handed Gun"") appears in two episodes, as does Strother Martin (""Hotel de Paree,"" ""The Wild Bunch""), Royal Dano, Paul Richards, and Mort Mills (""Man Without a Gun"").  Also guest starring in the first season are Charles Bronson, Dan Blocker, James Griffith (""Sheriff of Cochise""), John Carradine, Peter Whitney (""Rough Riders""), Chuck Connors (""Rifleman""), Leo Gordon, Pat Conway (""Tombstone Territory""), Robert Wilke, Claude Akins, DeForest Kelley, James Drury (""The Virginian""), Robert Vaughn, and John Larch.

2823667,5,B000PHX5KU,"In my humble opinion, Gunsmoke may very well be the best television show ever created. I don't say this because I am partial to westerns. My assessment is based on the quality of the production, the realism of the show, the acting of the main characters and supporting actors, the locations for shooting the scenes, and finally, the writing of the scripts. In all cases I give Gunsmoke five stars in each category. I have never seen a show on American television that can bring it all together in such perfection. I have always been a big fan of the Gunsmoke radio show because I believed that for its time, it was unsurpassed for quality and realism. I was skeptical that the television version of Gunsmoke could be as great as the radio show but I was proven wrong. The first season of Gunsmoke (1955/1956) did not finish in the top 15 for ratings but by the next season it jumped to number 8 and then by the 1957/1958 season it was the number one show on television for the next 4 seasons. John Wayne was right when he said that James Arness is the only man who could play Matt Dillon. Arness' imposing height of 6 feet 7 inches and his rugged appearance make him the perfect marshal to enforce law and order. The supporting cast of the show provides some great acting as well. Amanda Blake as Miss Kitty and Dennis Waver as Deputy Chester Goode compliment the superb performance of James Arness. The plots are often hard to predict which makes the show even more enjoyable. The dialogue that occurs between the characters is entertaining, realistic, intense, and sometimes humorous in its abruptness. For example, Matt Dillon is trying to determine who shot a prisoner in the jail cell. When he asks the sheriff of a nearby town the sheriff replies, ""I might have done it. Maybe I didn't like the way he looked."" Matt Dillion then knocks the sheriff to the ground with a hard right and says, ""Maybe I don't like the way you answer questions."" Parents be forewarned. This show is very realistic and somewhat brutal at times. There is usually at least one fatality before the show ends. I can't wait for season two to be released. Well worth the money.",1187568000,2,2154,4.554123711340206

It's amazing how well Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester worked together right from the start.

And we get to see Kitty wearing rather provocative outfits for the 50's from time to time which were later toned down a bit.

I have watched 3 of the discs and haven't come across one clunker yet!  CBS/Paramount better get on the ball and offer up the rest before the entire generation who saw Gunsmoke from 55-75 are ""Up on Boot Hill"".  May I suggest selling the first 7 seasons (I believe they were B/W and 30 minutes pershow) as a set for $149.99???  Or the entire 20 year series for $350??  I think that makes a reasonable profit for the studio, while giving options to those Gunsmoke lovers of various financial means.

I had forgotten that it was originally a half hour show, but even then all of the episodes are so well written and the actors great. The later expansion to an hour enabled the stories to have more depth and am looking forward to those.  It is easy to see why the show was on the air for over 20 years.  Imagine an actor/actress today being told they have to film 39 episodes for a show for one season when they complain about being over worked with the few they do now for a half hour show.

I hope they don't wait too long between the release of seasons so it does not take forever to get them all.  It would also be nice if there could be an interview of James Arness and/or Dennis Weaver while they are still with us.  Last winter I saw an interview of James Arness and the show was discussed  and it was good to see him and he still looks great although he is in his 80's now.

But on the flip side of that doulbe eagle coin, was justice, compassion, friendship, and hope.

2823677,5,B000PHX5KU,"James Arness portrayed Marshall Matt Dillon with a ""quiet-cool"" that has gone unmatched in the history of television. Arness himself had that ""quiet-cool"" quality in real life as well. When you pick up any show-biz/gossip magazine these days, you see the same old faces in EVERY magazine - they mug, they pose, they appear places just to get their pictures taken, they have ""entourages"", blah-blah-blah. Not James Arness. He didn't like the Hollywood party scene and only appeared in places he was expected to be. His picture in magazines was a rarity, but when we saw one, it was a real treat! Arness didn't have to pretend or try to be a star.....this man WAS a star, in the truest fashion of the term.

All right, on to this DVD package. There are only a couple of extras, those being original show sponsors. Imagine Marshall Dillon and Doc Adams talking about the great smoke you get with L&M cigarettes! John Wayne himself introduces the premiere GUNSMOKE episode, taking note that Jim Arness is going to be a huge star (he was right).

And get a load of this list of partial guest stars: Aaron Spelling, Barry Atwater (the vampire of ""The Night Stalker""), Brett Halsey, Charles Bronson, Chuck Connors, Claude Akins, Dabbs Greer, Dan Blocker, DeForest Kelley, Ed Platt (the Chief on ""Get Smart""), Howard McNear (Floyd on ""The Andy Griffith Show""), James Drury, John Carradine, John Dehner, Keye Luke, Lola Albright (WOW!), Raymond Bailey (Mr. Drysdale on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), Robert Vaughn, Royal Dano, Sebastian Cabot, Strother Martin and William Hopper! (I wonder if guest star Raymond Bailey remembered his appearance on GUNSMOKE and got the name for ""Milburn Drysdale"" from Milburn Stone who played Doc? Just a thought.....)

Adding to the great guest line-up are a few episode screenplays written by future film director Sam Peckinpah.

Amanda Blake looks incredible in this season...it's a wonder why Marshall Dillon didn't take her up on her advances...or did he? As the episodes progress, you'll notice how Miss Kitty gradually adds more makeup. She also makes it known (more than once) to Matt that she'd like to be his wife - something that would continue throughout her stay on the show.

In this season, we get no clue as to what Chester is. Is he a deputy? He wears no badge. Is he just a sidekick? Whenever Matt introduces him to someone it's always as plain old ""Chester Goode,"" never as ""deputy"" or any other title.....so what the heck is he? It's not even revealed what caused the limp in his leg...or is it wooden? Sometimes the leg is so stiff (especially when he's runnin'), it looks like it's supposed to be wood!

Milburn Stone dives right in as Doc Adams, all crusty & blustery right from the get-go.

This first season has the familiar GUNSMOKE theme but with the added ""clip-clop"" effect that was later dropped.

Bloopers left in include the gravestones at the beginning of most of the episodes; they wobble when the wind blows.....and listen for an airplane flying overhead in the episode ""The Hunter."" By the way, the opening to almost every show where Matt walks through Boot Hill was so identifiable with the show, it was even parodied in MAD (before it became a magazine, when it was still a comic book).

The last time I saw these first GUNSMOKE shows was when it was syndicated under the title ""Marshall Dillon"" and the shows were fuzzy. Now, it's like discovering lost episodes! The clarity is so crisp and clean, it's absolutely extraordinary.

The stories are not what you'd expect - Marshall Dillon doesn't always save the victims in time, he doesn't always have the right answer, the wrong people get killed and there are plot twists that you won't see coming - this is NOT one of those predictable 50's TV programs! No wonder this show lasted 20 years! There's even a show about drug addiction - opium, to be exact - that you wouldn't think they would even dare to do in sterile 50's television.....but GUNSMOKE did!

If you're alert, you may catch a few historical innaccuracies, but who really cares? This is extremely enjoyable stuff...so if one of the characters mentions a certain year that doesn't sound correct, just ignore it...IT DOESN'T MATTER...IT'S ONLY A TV SHOW!

I noticed some similarities between GUNSMOKE and ""The Andy Griffith Show;"" both programs had the wise-but-tough marshall/sheriff and the goofy-but-lovable sidekick/deputy. Even the episode titled ""Chester's Mail Order Bride"" could've easily been re-written as an Andy Griffith episode. In fact, I think it was! Watch it and see for yourself.....and I wish I had a dollar for every time some bad guy said ""this ain't nunna yore bizness marshall,"" ""stay out of this marshall,"" ""you'll be sorry, marshall"" or ""just try and stop me, marshall!"" I'd be rich.

I can't say enough good things about this set. Get it - and enjoy the ""quiet-cool"" of James Arness: an unmatched, truly great television star.",1185062400,17,4924,4.875598086124402
2823678,5,B000PHX5KU,"CBS-Paramount has finally released the entire first season of ""Gunsmoke"" on DVD.  Speaking as a long-time fan of the series (particularly the heretofore seldom-seen half hour episodes), I couldn't be more pleased with this set.  I unhesitatingly give it five stars and believe that it's a fantastic value for the price.  All 39 first-season episodes are here and all 15 that I've viewed so far look exceptionally good, with crystal clear video and audio.  The back of the box includes a disclaimer ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""  However, I have yet to spot any instances of missing material and I believe that CBS-Paramount made a genuine good faith effort to include all surviving footage.  All 15 episodes that I've viewed so far ""timed out"" between 26:10 and 26:30.  In addition, fans who already own the previously released DVDs sold by Columbia House will note that footage missing from several episodes on those discs IS included on this set.  They will also notice that the original (and correct) ""Matt on Boot Hill"" introductions have been restored and included with the episodes on this set.  The only very minor flaw I've noticed is that some of the episodes are slightly mislabeled on the individual disc menus.  ""Night Incident"" is labeled as ""Night Visitor"", ""Unmarked Grave"" is labeled as ""Unknown Grave"", and ""The Big Broad"" is labeled as ""Big Broad"".  I would also note that the  only ""extras"" consist of original sponsor spots.  However, I personally found the L & M cigarette ads with James Arness and Milburn Stone to be far more fascinating than the interviews or ""The Making of"" featurettes that are included with most DVDs.  Any fan of ""Gunsmoke"" will be thrilled with this set, and fans who've never seen the half-hour episodes (or those who haven't seen them in a long time), will be especially enthusiastic.

before you start getting  on me for not rating Gunsmoke 5 stars...its the series on  DVD i'm dissing...not  the show.

Obviously CBS/Paramount  are going to force diehard fans to buy the 50th Anniversary set plus the Directors set plus the season sets to get all the goodies.  I don't mind the extras like cast appearances on the Mike Douglas show to be left off..but leaving  off commentaries (like James Arness from the opening episode) really stinks.

2823680,5,B000PHX5KU,"I saw a number of early Gunsmoke episodes and couldn't get over how entertaining these half hour black and white episodes were. Like the 1950s anthology dramas, they tell their story with action (needed for this genre) and drama....very lean. The series should have retired after the 1966-67 season as the remaining 8 seasons are so boring they are unwatchable. We were instead treated to self-concious, talky episodes that gave one the feeling of running through a field of wet tar. It was the result of a wave of anti-violence protest tying writers' hands which is not a good thing for the westerm genre.

2823681,5,B000PHX5KU,"While I applaud Paramount Home Video's decision to put this icon of television history out in full season boxes, I just hope they're truly committed to staying the course. Remember, if they go the distance and complete the entire series that will be 20 box sets and at a release rate of 2, maybe 3 sets a year, it will take at minimum the better part of eight years to release the entire series. And if past history is any indication, sometimes studios aren't committed to staying the course with releasing long-running TV series in season by season box sets. An example of this would be ""Hill Street Blues"" which ran seven seasons but Fox Home Entertainment so far has only released seasons 1 (in 2004) and 2 (in 2005) and seems to have lost interest in proceeding with releasing that remainder of the series. The seem to have also gotten cold feet with releasing any more than the first four seasons of the Bob Newhart Show which ran a total of 8 seasons but their last release was Season 4 and that was over two years ago. PHV has also committed ""Perry Mason"" to DVD in it's entirety and that series ran 9 seasons. They're releasing it in 2 volumes per season sequence, two sets a year. At that rate it will take nine years for them to release the whole series. So I hope PHV is serious about committing Gunsmoke in it's entirety to DVD.",1183420800,14,1340,4.42914979757085

I prefer color, i have the first 4 seasons from Columbia House and Ebay in b&w, it would be just wonderful to see them in color.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that thinks it should be released pretty fast, as most of the fans that are absolutely hooked are over 50 and won't be around after the next 20 years.

I've alway's liked Amanda Blake, however, Matt and Chester are too busy out gettin' the bad guys and doc is too busy stichin' people up to be doin' a lot of sittin' around jawin'.

As much as many of you probably like Festus from 1963 onward, you're going to love Chester. There's been some misinformation out there. Chester was never Marshall Dillon's Deputy. He'd help the marshal around the office, many times around town, and quite often would ride out of town with Matt on official business, however, I believe that Dennis Weaver said on a recent DVD set that he was never a deputy. When you look carefully at the episodes when they come out in July you won't see a deputy star on Chester. I believe that Festus did become a deputy.

Personally, I'll probably just purchase all eight seasons that have Chester. Dennis Weaver was just that tremendous as Chester and he and James Arness had such good chemestry together.

At The Long Branch you'll see some kidding between Chester and Doc that will remind you of the kidding between Festus and Doc, you'll see Matt sitting there and, of course Miss Kitty. However, you won't see as much of all of the jawin' because Doc has some stichin' up to do in his office and Matt and Chester have some bad guys to get!

Dennis Weaver, as Chester, has some great funny lines, however, the emphasis is on action and it's action that you'll get! Thirty minutes doesn't alow a whole lot of jawin' and that's ok with me!",1179878400,13,1723,4.54516129032258
2823686,5,B000PHX5KU,"I already have the first 3 1/2 years of ""Gunsmoke"" from the Columbia House membership program. It could never be explained to me why more releases weren't available. So I've been purchasing VHS copies of ""Gunsmoke the Collectrs Edition"" from ebay. Of course I've purchased the Anniversary and Directors editions, but I need more.

For those of us who weren't around in 1955 and have had to watch reruns on TVLand or up until December 2005 the Western Channel (only 60 min episodes) you might find the writing and the acting in the first few episodes a little stiff (""Night Incident"" is downright strange) but by the time you get to ""Magnus"" you really begin to see the ""characters"" you know and love begin to come into their own. Just for instance, Miss Kitty's voice actually changes from soft and demure to what most people are familiar with, strong and assertive, as did her character.

""Gunsmoke"" is a fantastic show and thoroughly enjoyable. It deserves to have the over 600 episodes released on DVD (PLEASE).",1179705600,5,1014,4.788571428571428
2823687,5,B000PHX5KU,"Yes, the wait is over!!!  Gunsmoke is one of the best shows ever made and I am so happy that they are finally coming out with the complete first season.  I have all or most of the Columbia House dvds containing the first several half-hour seasons.  I think I have watched them so much that I know every one of those episodes by heart.  I will still be purchasing these complete season dvds, though!

The half hour episodes did start out with Matt walking around on Boot Hill describing the shenanigans that go on in Dodge City and giving you a glimpse of the story of that episode. The first episode starts out with an introduction by John Wayne.

There are two things that I think are funny about Gunsmoke.  First, in one or more episodes Matt talks about the ""flatlands"" of the prairie where Dodge is located (and if you are a person who has never made a pilgimage to Dodge City, it really is quite flat), but then many episodes portray the Dodge area as having mountains, hills and gulches in the background.  I know this is because of where they filmed the show in California, but I still think it is funny. Second, why in the world was Doc Adams' office on the second floor??  Matt always said ""Let's get this man up to Doc's"".  Why didn't Doc have his office on the first floor...no more dragging injured people up the stairs?  ;)  Oh, and Doc's first name is Galen.

If you are a person who has never seen the half hour episodes and likes superbly done acting and story lines, then this is the dvd set for you.  Not to mention how handsome James Arness is! I believe it is a tribute to Mr. James Arness and the show that people are reviewing it even prior to this dvd's release!  We just can't wait!",1178409600,13,1706,4.320754716981132
2823688,5,B000PHX5KU,"Yes, the wait is over.  I only hope Paramount does a better job of restoration than Columbia House did.  I have seasons 1, 2, 3 and part of season 4 all from Columbia House but their editions sometimes include scratchy, chopped up versions of the syndicated Marshal Dillon, rather than the complete original Gunsmokes.

I hope also that they include the original 1st season opening, which was not that of Dillon facing off against the man in black in the Dodge City street (that version that we all know was actually filmed during the early part of 1956 at Gene Autry's Melody Ranch location and was used, I believe, beginning in September 1956).

I have been searching for information on the first season opening and have been thus far unsuccessful.  I have heard that the original opening actually began with Dillon on Boot Hill, either before OR after the opening credits and I have not been able to find out what the actual opening credits looked like. I have heard also that they used a six gun aimed at the camera and fired a shot which exuded large amounts of gunsmoke.

Does anyone out there have any info??",1178150400,19,1115,4.606060606060606

The people that wrote these episodes must be geniuses, because they are like Greek tragedies. I have been watching Gunsmoke since I was a little kid. Now that I'm 61 I figured I start at the beginning with season 1, and go from there. I always thought Festus was better than Chester when I was younger, but now that I'm almost finished with season 2, I believe Chester was every bit as good as Festus, different, but just as good.",1518998400,,537,4.326732673267327
