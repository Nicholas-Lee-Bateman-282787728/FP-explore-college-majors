8535026,5,B00936A22S,Very good old classic movie. Great story line (might appear out dated to some but still a refreshing story) Pat O'Brien was one of many stars from the gangster era movies and with Humphrey Bogart makes this one a keeper.,1359504000,,220,4.525
8535027,3,B00936A22S,"The 1930's was a time of great international tensions? The ethnic tensions which exploded in the first world war boiled up throughout the period prior to this film,..and this film within its short alotted time aims to discuss this in the microcosm of new york city..so it is an ambitious production..but the film towards the end meanders towards a disney like ending? I recently saw a film Water for Elephants, a homage to old film making and the film works since the character played by Reese Witherspoon breathes life within her almost like a small figurine is espanded into the young man's carnal imagination..like the pictures of a hollywood gossip magazine where the photos begin to talk..the supporting role in this film played by the Bogart character..its interesting later in life this actor visited at his home in 1954..a large mansion..that morning he signed to film in Italy in The Barefoot Contessa..but the 5 visiting students instead of talking about movie stars..and stuff like that..talked of film theory and what gives people a chance to act..and the inner self which allows them to develop..to expand their horizons..make a role come to life..almost like making a figure appear lifesize before our eyes..or a picture talk..

 This film may be the least regarded of all the early Bogart films? It is an Irish story, set in new york in 1937,
like europe the various tensions are present in this post Sacco and Vanzetti era, and we have an irish cop, and the irish police were renown on the east coast, who tickets a few Italian merchants and trolley like salespersons who appear in court and later have their cases thrown out? Their families cant pay? He's a cop by the books..if thats the case? The superiors don't like this kind of ticketing, he should be more community oriented, but he refuses to resign..he then tickets Bogart who has a lame daughter..and he's late for work..and is fired? Bogart ends up in a penitentiary..and O'brien helps his daughter..although Philips(I believe his character's name)..is exiled to Canada..and that exile is always prominent in his mind? Later on with a group of merchants outside..the cop talks of rainmakers..in the pouring rain..like bringing back a youthful memory..a boy unable to play outside because of the rain..a boy unable to play and have fun among the different ethnic groups..rainmakers..and the Bogart character gets out and in a struggle shoots the O'brien cop..all this is ok..before I talk of how the film is resolved..or not? I will talk of the children which play a large part in this film, and add interest and warmth..and a pastor..a world which once concerned itself with children, all persons, thieves, police, and average persons..and this child's world is related a lame girl(a very biblical like image)..and the cop drawn to the family based on his relation to the lame little girl..and there are many scenes with children, and when the cop goes to school..there is a teaching setting..and ann sheridan is added as a teacher..the film has a good supporting cast..so they wanted it to be seen..and Philips wife and a few females around are beautifully attired and look and talk graciously(too graciously and look too nice for the job he has?)..but the father too in home scenes is drawn to the daughter..is disposed towards her..goes to Canada to work for her..so the children are part of this canvas..

So a good pastiche up to the shooting..then O'brien..needs a blood transfusion and the BOgart character is the donor hearing that O'brien tried to save his daughter and help in his absence? The lame girl has him throw out his law book and leads to conversion, the school bus scene at the end of film, and Bogart too is reformed..ethnic tesnsions are done away with and they talk like two angels..almost lovers..except O'brien doesnt want it to be known he has Irish blood in him..a good film ruined by preposterous ending and dialogue,,the O'brien character stating he doesnt want Bogart jailed..to help the little girl and family..what about helping society from criminals? Good ideas and good film which is totally ruined by disney..childlike ending..if people were like this..life would be easy..but at least we have some nice and good scenes of 1930' s life up to finale..even O'brien's walk among the merchants at film's end where he is liked..everyone loves everyone..and his conversion by seeing the lame little girl..at film's ending the heart..a noble idea..but how true to life is it?..thanks to warners for bringing out this film I have not seen it on tv",1357430400,4,4552,4.971128608923885
