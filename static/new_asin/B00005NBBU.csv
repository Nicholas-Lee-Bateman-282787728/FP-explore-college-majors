7946583,5,B00005NBBU,this is a good selection for showing the holiday spirit and how sometimes it takes more than just faith.  Sometimes it takes looking back to the past to be able to move to the future and be able to celebrate the holidays.,1330387200,,221,4.261904761904762
7946584,5,B00005NBBU,"I've never been a huge fan of this show, in fact the holiday episode with Ann-Margret was the only episode I caught.  That being said, it's one of the most touching and well acted (largely in part due to Ann-Margret's brilliant performance) show I've seen in a long time.  This episode will surely make you teary-eyed...I was expecting a sappy holiday episode and this is in no way that! This is a great piece of work.  Ann-Margret was overlooked by the EMMY committee (as usual) for this one.",1014768000,6,493,4.579545454545454
