8272307,5,B00197POZ4,"For me, this fascinating film was a trip down memory lane. The counter culture movement of the '60s and '70s was particularly intense in the artistic community. This group of young filmmakers combined their passion for film with their radical political views to form a communal artistic endevor. Since I've generally considered art to be more of an individual undertaking - at least in the vision, if not the execution - I found the idea to be something of an oxymoron, yet this group made several interesting films and even captured the top award at the Venice Film Festival. We all change as we age, and listening to the filmmakers look back at this social experiment really made me smile. Very enjoyable.",1379462400,,707,4.80327868852459
