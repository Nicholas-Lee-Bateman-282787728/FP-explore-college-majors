7854147,5,6303833411,"Tchaikowsky's Nutcracker has, over the past century, become a fundamental Christmas season entertainment staple, in the event quite appropriate, since the work's action takes place upon Christmas Eve, but as the ballet has proved to be such a popular affair to all ages, it is a welcome diversion during any time of year.  This rendering, shot with videotape for BBC Television before a very appreciative live matinee audience at Covent Garden, is abounding with first-class stage design, costumes, and special effects, all of which join with a good deal of splendid dancing by members of the Royal Ballet to make for a most engaging film.  The original linear choreography created by Lev Ivanov (1892) has been employed, when applicable, by Peter Wright, Artistic Director of the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, whose researches within dance archives revealed a large amount of material that is used here for the staging methods of the piece, while additionally providing attendant and highly creative movements that often focus upon comedic elements intrinsic within the original work, without eschewing its well-known storyline requirements.  A cardinal reason for most balletomanes to view the film will naturally center upon the technical credits of Anthony Dowell, soon to be named Director of the Royal Ballet, and here performing as The Prince, and his highly able partner, Lesley Collier, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, and although sporadic raggedness may be found throughout from members of the Corps, the four specialty numbers performed in the Land of Sweets (Spanish, Arab, Chinese, Russian) are ably danced as is as well the acting by all, notably Julie Rose as Clara and Guy Niblett as Clara's companion, The Nutcracker himself.  Dowell's perfection of line is seen here to good effect, especially in his cool and light partnering of Collier during their pas de deux, this perhaps most beautiful of all romantic pieces, and a meet showcase for the skills of the pair, with the ballerina's port de bras being exceptional.  Mention must additionally be made of the elegantly detailed designing by Julia Trevelyan Oman, efficient lighting from John B. Read, and the musicological augmentation by Tchaikowsky authority Roland John Wiley, along with proficient conducting of Gennady Rozhdestvensky who is minutely conversant with Tchaikowsky's score.  While there can be no denying the artistic impact of several other filmed performances of Nutcracker, this effort will be the most emotionally pleasing to many viewers.",1236816000,6,2522,5.340050377833753
7854148,1,6303833411,"I really love this Royal Ballet Production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. The orchestra sounds much better than on the Baryshnikov version. The percussion section here could blow off the viewer's speakers. Now I can see why Svetlanov conducts in a slow pace here on this production: it's to bring out everything the orchestra has to offer and to fit the dancing and choreography. The complaint I have is that Mother Ginger is cut. Everything else is in there and I don't have to worry at all. Here's another problem: If only Gelsey Kirkland was on this video instead of the Baryshnikov one. She's more gorgeous looking than this girl who plays Clara here(I forgot what her name was). Gelsey Kirkland is more gorgeous looking than anybody else who played the role of Clara in a Nutcracker. I don't think there's anyone more gorgeous looking who played Clara. All the Nutcracker versions I've heard have a not-so-pretty looking girl who plays Clara. Come on directors, think pretty when you're talking about a character like Clara. If I were a director, I would. Everyone else looks fantastic. But the Clara, no way! Somebody should hire a really pretty looking Clara the next time they do a Nutcracker production, someone who looks more like Gelsey Kirkland!",1070755200,8,1259,4.915492957746479
7854149,3,6303833411,"I bought this ballet because I wanted to round out my Nutcracker collection.  I already own the Baryshnikov/American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet versions and, of the three, this is by far the weakest and least interesting.  The party scene is way too busy, and the costumes for the adults are unattractive, to say the least.  The adults lack personality, and the children are underplayed.  The NYCB production comes off much better here, even with the presence of Macauley Culkin.  Real children appear in that ballet; the ABT version uses some of its younger corps members.  But both of the other versions have lots of color.  The party guests also appear to be having fun!  Robert LaFosse and Heather Watts (NYCB) and Gayle Young and Sallie Wilson (ABT) are much better as the party's hosts.
The Kingdom of the Sweets falls way short.  It is lavish, and the costumes are lush, but everything is colorless.  The various dancers are almost indistinguishable from one another save for occasional touches like Russian boots and Spanish headscarves.  Where are the candy canes?  Where are Mother Ginger and the Polichinelles?  Missing and very much missed.  The dancing, however, is excellent, although Dowell is a fine danseur noble and excellent partner but does not have the good feet of Baryshnikov or young Ethan Stiefel.  However, it could be Sleeping Beauty as far as anyone could tell who would be watching it without the music.  The NYCB version is FAR superior.  ABT's also is more watchable, although the ending is a little bizarre thanks to Baryshnikov's new interpretation.  Unless you are a collector, do not buy this.",1037318400,20,1645,4.9416058394160585
7854150,3,6303833411,"This version of ""The Nutcracker"" starts so delightfully that the completely boring sections after the fight with the mice make it seem that you are watching two different ballets. The ""Land of the Sweets"" is done in whites and golds - ALL THE COSTUMES. The makeup even looks almost like clown white makeup. The fun sections with the Spanish, Russian etc. dances turn out dull and with no color in the costumes not worth watching. The Nutcracker Prince in his red costume is the only hint of real color and he looks terrible out of place in the general color scheme. Missing are the delightful Mother Ginger, Arab dance and peppermint sticks of the New York City version.
For the most satisfying version, I recommend the wonderful New York City Ballet by far. There is really no comparison with this sterile, bland production. If you do get this Royal Ballet version, turn it off after the fight with the mice.",976752000,11,909,4.6875
7854151,3,6303833411,"We got this video to watch with our children at Christmas time.  My children love the first half of the performance, but after that, they ask me to turn it off.  They miss the dance of the peppermints and Mother Ginger and get bored watching Lesley Collier dance again, and again, and again.  Perhaps people came to see her dance, but it seems to me that the story gets lost in the end of this performance in such a long feature of the prima donna.",976060800,4,448,4.247058823529412
7854152,5,6303833411,I received this video from my Grandfather for Christmas several years ago and absolutely love it.  I watch it every Christmas along with many other  versions of the Nutcracker.  Anthony Dowell and Lesley Collier are a sheer  delight as the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier.  Julie Rose is also very  good as Clara.  I would highly recommend this video to all ballet lovers.
