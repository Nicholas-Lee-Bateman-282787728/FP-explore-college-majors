Luskin does a beautiful job capturing the importance of forgiveness, outlining the steps involved and inspiring us to practice our ""forgiveness muscle"" daily. I highly recommend this dvd. It would also be useful in group settings.",1192579200,9,313,5.1568627450980395
8034813,4,B0002YJ2GC,"Very powerful book on Forgiveness. Hopefully, Dr. Fred Luskin will make it into my empathy & forgiveness class at a prison that I volunteer at. I was able to forgive the young man that murdered my son in his dorm room at Gallaudet University, not because of Fred's book.  But, Fred's book is helping me with the guys in my class on their journey of forgiveness. Most of them have murdered someone, and we are going through this forgiveness journey together.",1479081600,3,457,4.6419753086419755

8034816,5,B0002YJ2GC,"This book is not just a treatise on the subject of forgiveness. It is a rare gem leading to a happier and less stress filled life.  Dr. Luskin reminds us that we cannot control other's actions and the best way to cope with this fact is to say to yourself ""I had hoped that..."" and then just let go of anger and frustration. This book has changed my life!!! I would recommend it to anyone.",1330560000,,388,4.173333333333333

I EXPECTED.
I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT...I FELT IT WAS VERY OUTDATED.",1328659200,,118,4.409090909090909
8034818,5,B0002YJ2GC,"I was not so sure about buying this book.  But honestly was so full of anger, depression, and bitterness I was desperate.  I read the reviews and thought what have I got to lose.  I have to say ""Thank you...Thank you to Dr. Luskin and his team for studying forgiveness and helping me unlock what was inside me all along.  I feel a weight has been lifted from me and I find joy in my life that I haven't seen in a long time.  I can honestly say I have let my grievences toward my absent father go.  I feel renewed and so much more alive.  If you are struggling with a grudge or unforgiveness.  This book is amazing and will show you how to move forward.",1318204800,,652,4.078740157480315
8034819,5,B0002YJ2GC,"Fred Luskin's life-giving approach to forgiveness is a breath of fresh air, because the tools he offers actually work!  This is not simply a detached analysis of the dynamics of forgiveness; it can easily be employed in a methodical, hands-on process in which forgiveness is actually experienced.  I used this DVD in a course that I taught, and the students were drawn to its utility, especially the insights that forgiveness is all about you (yes, some things really are); the tremendous costs of not forgiving; and forgiveness is not about healing the past.  You want a useful guide?  Here it is.",1298246400,3,598,4.891089108910891
8034820,5,B0002YJ2GC,"I use this DVD in counseling individuals and families, in groups and in church classes. Excellent message that is clearly presented- not dry at all. I have watched this several times and always feel I learn something new. Luskin is an excellent teacher in the area of forgiveness. Highly recommend this DVD.",1260576000,5,307,4.923076923076923
8034821,5,B0002YJ2GC,"Dr. Fred Luskin of Stanford University, has spent many years studying the positive and healing power of forgiveness. This is a scientific and practical solution to those who are caught in this world full of hate, revenge, and destructiveness.

His research took him to Northern Ireland as well as other conflict areas in the world.

He has, based on his comprehensive research, created a systematic and workable step by step solution for those who are sick and tired of being sick and tired of hatred, revenge, and other negative stuff.

He has a convincing, and powerful argument to give insight into why forgiveness heals and how to get over our narratives that encourage hate.

Yet he does not advocate a passive approach that lets others use us as doormats.

This is a highly effective and useful book!",1239494400,2,806,4.854014598540146
8034822,4,B0002YJ2GC,"Excellent material - a DVD I will watch again and again when I need a reminder that grudges are not healthy both mentally and physically and harm only the person holding the grudge.  While it was a great DVD, it left me wanting more material, while great content, it seems only a taste of what can be learned from his books and seminars.  I recommend it.",1193270400,8,354,4.348484848484849
