Really good, worth the money. Corporate America, make your people watch this and stop killing your staff with terrible power points.",1372291200,,227,4.675
8136958,5,B000H6SVHQ,"PowerPoint has been the tool of choice for presentations at our company almost since MicroSoft introduced the program. Each new release brought more bells and whistles which allowed us to make fantastic ""Slide Shows"" as we attempted to ""Get our message heard"".
Wow! Were we wrong!. The message on this DVD is as clear as can be, then when implemented into your designs, people actually tell you ""They now get it"", your message that is. Less is more! After overwhelming our audience with ""How much we knew about clicking on the right button"", it is now crystal clear that ""They don't care about that"". What's in it for them...that's what they care about.
Now we give the audience just that.
Thanks Mr Jefferys for the lifesaving tips

The presenter actually could benefit from a program like Toastmasters for his presentation skills, but the information on developing excellent powerpoint presentations is outstanding. I highly recommend this program!",1167868800,,258,6.194444444444445

After purchasing this DVD I now know why my audience pulls out their PDA's 5 minutes into my talk.

After implimenting the physical/ mental and design recommendations in just my first new presentation, I was able to generate $30,000 in additional revenue. I have no doubt this was the result of the changes I made to my presentation that I learned form this DVD.

I highly reccommend you buy and use this.
