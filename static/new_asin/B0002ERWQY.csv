8027273,4,B0002ERWQY,"I don't know if you can call the premise of this anime more farfetched than any other anime, but it is basically a fun, silly anime without any grand commentary or existential issues.  However, it does focus on the antics of ex-gang leader, turned high school teacher Onizuka and his attempts at a ""normal"" romantic relationship with one of the other teachers. In his own way, he is able to enforce discipline from wayward students and help them solve some of their stickier teen problems since he is only a few years removed from that period himself.  The quality of the anime is average, but the humor and characters are above average, given the nature of this anime.",1392163200,,669,4.661016949152542

8027277,5,B0002ERWQY,"Onizuka provokes the wrath of Uchiyamada when he begins to privately tutor the Vice Principal's daughter. Compromising photos, misunderstandings and general disdain of GTO come to play - as unsual. As if that isn't enough, the street racing school nurse starts selling contraband in the infirmary!",1130544000,,297,5.478260869565218
8027278,4,B0002ERWQY,"Let me start off by saying that I read the manga before buying the anime, so it influenced my viewing experience quite a bit.

That being said, I feel the series was an amusing adaptation of the GTO story and characters. However, after waiting months for the second boxed set to be released, I was somewhat let down (though not enough to make me regret the purchase). The ending was my main sticking point in the series. It just didn't fit at all. My guess is that the anime series got ahead of the manga at the time (as often happens in Japan), ratings went down, no third season was secured and an ending had to be wrapped up in the last few episodes of the second set.

Other than that, the series is funny and at times almost shows a glimmer of the downright touching bits contained in the manga.

This leads me to my second, slightly less major gripe: the changes in the storyline aside, there were many critical points in many of the character's backgrounds and certain key plot points that were changed in a debilitating manor or removed completely. Many of the points that were changed seemed to have been modified to ""purify"" the show for TV (a shock to me, considering the racious nature of Japanese TV (fan service anyone?)) due to their sensitive subject matter. The changing of these points, specifically Aizawa's reason for hating teachers and Kanzaki's revenge plot against Aizawa (and the complete removal of the REAL reason Kanzaki wanted revenge in the first place and her subsequent suicide attempt), removed the gravity from the situations, dumbed down the series, and inevitably lead to the unsatisfactory ending mentioned in the Editorial Review (which needs editing by the way: it was Uehara Anko causing trouble on the trip, Aizawa refused to even go on the trip, let alone cause trouble on it).

Personally though, I implore you to read the manga as it is far easier to appreciate and well worth the read. I feel you can appreciate the anime significantly more if you understand the characters and their real motivations before you watch this series. It will help you to avoid any confusions one might have about certain events, such as why Yoshikawa and Uehara end up together even after all of the abuse she puts Yoshikawa through,  why Kanzaki and Aizawa are at each other's throats, and to tie up loose ends such as what happens regarding the whole Teshigawara mess (they reintroduce him for a few brief seconds for what seems like no good reason (they apparently thought hard about writing his second plot in the manga into the anime, but whoops, no money)).

Overall, while having significantly less character depth and gravity and an ending that falls flat on its face, the series is an amusing and enjoyable romp through the highlights of the first handful of volumes of the manga.",1098489600,11,2814,4.709349593495935
