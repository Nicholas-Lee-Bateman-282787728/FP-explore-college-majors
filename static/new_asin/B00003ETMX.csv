7918568,2,B00003ETMX,"Yeah, I am a B movie virgin, but evidently trying to lose it lately. And lose it I will if I see much more of this dreck.

Again I ask, ""Why do they bother to spend money making these movies?""
Is there a secret joke I am unaware of that these movies are supposed to be so bad that they are funny?  Did it go over my head?  Was I home sick that day?  Did I miss the memo?

This movie contained some of the same footage from another B movie called
""Nautilus"".  Same vehicle, same chase scene, same submarine footage.
Don't ask how I remember, I just have a good visual memory.  I should
do error work for the movie industry, I see enough ""oops's"" in these
movies.  Oops or careless or intentional?

I can't figure out why they spend all that money to make something I wouldn't bother putting in the shredder.  (That makes a lot of sense, who puts movies, VHS or DVD, in the shredder?)  Ok, so it just came out that way.

Let's not even mention the insanely ratty wig Jeff Fahey dons to play his own grandson.  Army fatigues and long indian hair with beads?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???  According to the movie, the grandson's mother was blonde, and Fahey is nearly blond, depending on the bottle he uses (I should talk, right?) Did they disinfect that thing before using it?

Why would Jeff Fahey allow his already B movie reputation be sullied into the ridiculous?  He is capable of much more, and I am still trying to figure out why he never has allowed himself to do better.  I think I have a finger on it now.

If you are looking for a bad movie, this is it.

AAAAGGGHHHH!",1233273600,,1573,4.25
7918569,1,B00003ETMX,"How in the hell did anyone agree to act in this?  Where do I begin?  Bad/stilted acting, grotesque editing (I think the editing team was all on a bender), laughable, bathtub-style special effects (all one of them) and makeup on a villain that was a direct ripoff of Star Wars.  The ""bad guys"" seemed to do the bunny hop every time they were ordered to give chase to the good guys.  I won't even touch the black/white rape scene because it's just beneath contempt.

The sequences jump all over the place as though the editors were told that no act could last longer than 5 minutes.  Were they on timers?

Blech! just doesn't do justice to this vomitous mess.

What's even more shocking is that I discovered the ""lead"" actor actually has a fan club!  What, they couldn't find a lump of clay?

Not recommended for pregnant women, old folks, or young children under 99.  See at your own peril (and with a large bottle of Pepto handy).

Oh, and I gave this a star because the system wouldn't accept 0 stars.",1200614400,,1002,4.445054945054945
7918570,5,B00003ETMX,"Where do I begin? The story was so bad, it must have been devised in some high school film club! The acting was so wooden I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of  what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights!  Another actor has this constant look of being constipated! But it was the dialog that takes the cake.

Our hero says to his captors  - all holding submachine guns - if you touch a female prisoner you will be dead. Needless to say the only  black guard and the only white women prisoner (How racist, I know!) go at it.  When our fearless leader, who has this very annoying, raspy gangster voice, catches wind of this transgression, he calmly walks up to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! He then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially yell at him!

I could go on and on! This movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make  you laugh!",1179100800,2,1079,4.280788177339901
7918571,1,B00003ETMX,"I gave this movie 1 star for effort. One of the first things we see is that it takes place in 1990. A supernatural phenomenon 350 meters Beneath the Bermuda Triangle transports a sub and its crew into the future. But the film does nothing to tell us that. We see the sub go in and then after ten more minutes of the actors spouting dialogue, we learn that apparently seven years have passed. This is a minor side note in someone's dialogue when Jeff Fahey's character hears that his wife is still alive and did not remarry.

WAIT a minute... Huh?

That's exactly where this movie keeps going. It is told in flashback format with more flashbacks and flashforwards than a standard art flick. Long story short - somehow they end up in the distant future and there's this gigantic submarine that overtakes the sub our main characters are in.

The captain of that giant sub is Richard Tyson's character. And I have to say that no other actor in history has been so miscast and overacting in every emotional stereotype. Besides the scene of the only female on the sub being raped by the only black guy in the movie... and Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle's Dad - Hal) being one of the most pathetic excuses for a villain ever...

This film just plain sucks. Fahey plays the hero who doesn't quite come off as even remotely heroic. When he throws on a ragged long-hair wig to play his alternate reality equivalent, it's even worse.

But wait... is it an alternate reality or the future? In some scenes it's one or the other, in some scenes it's both. I guess they couldn't make up their minds...

Summing it all up, this film is as confusing as this review. Watch at your own risk.

If you like crappy B- movies with time travel and submarines and no real excitement, then BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE is what you're looking for.

The best way the producers might improve this movie is to add the subtitle of what year we are seing when the year changes. Otherwise, we'll never know until it's too late to care.",1161993600,,2009,4.484931506849315
