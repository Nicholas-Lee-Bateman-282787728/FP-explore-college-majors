1402454,5,B000057SIT,O.K so I watched Kane and Abel many years ago as a teenager. It had drama intrigue and romance what's not to love. Do I have to blast some of the nonsense on DVD today Juno??(whatever) Little miss sunshine?? in order to be convincing,1214179200,3,233,4.318181818181818
1402455,5,B000057SIT,Let me add my vote for finding and making this delicious miniseries available once more...from a reputable source.,1209772800,5,114,5.388888888888889
1402456,5,B000057SIT,I want to add my vote to making Kane and Abel available on dvd. It was the first movie I saw after reading the book that was every bit as good as the the book. Peter Strauss and Sam Neill were both excellent as was the rest of the cast. I truely hope that it will be made available soon.,1205884800,4,287,3.8
1402457,5,B000057SIT,"Come on folks! We are living in the DVD age. VHS is such an old format now. WHY is this STILL not available on DVD? There is so much garbage on DVD. Why not make room for a few more classics of which this most definitely is? I have always enjoyed the movies Peter Strauss has made and together with another very fine actor, Sam Neill, they provide the perfect casting for this superb mini series. I hope someone produces this on DVD soon. I, for one, will buy it!",1199923200,13,463,4.155555555555556
1402458,5,B000057SIT,I remember this mini-series fondly and only wish it were available on DVD. The acting was great and the story was stunning! I really wish these classics movies would be put on DVD rather than some of the junk that is out there!,1156896000,22,227,4.3023255813953485
1402459,5,B000057SIT,"Simply a brilliant piece of art put together by masters; such as the story author Sir. Jeffrey Archer, the film director/crew and actors ""Peter Straus and Sam Neil""

1402483,5,B000057SIT,"I watched the mini-series when it first aired and loved it. Brilliant production. 20+ years later, I still remember it.  My 3 teenagers have now read the book and often hear me refer to the series.  I would love for them to be able to see it.  I can't believe that the mini-series it is not available to purchase.

1402486,5,B000057SIT,"I simply cannot believe this epic series [so vividly remembered by so many] is not available on DVD! ""Kane and Abel""; ""The Noble House"" and ""V"" were the only circa-80's mini-series I watched with utmost interest. None of the other mini-series [so popular back then] were of interest to me after the first night. Last year, I finally found ""The Noble House"". I have ""[The Complete] V""... now I WANT ""KANE AND ABEL""! FYI, ""Roots"" and ""North and South"" also received my great interest but they were circa-70's... weren't they?",1239840000,2,523,4.822222222222222
1402487,5,B000057SIT,"This movie absolutely must be released on DVD.  It is far superior to many movies that are in DVD format, so Kane and Abel undoubtedly deserves better than just VHS.",1239148800,3,165,4.5

1402490,5,B000057SIT,I am amazed that this movie is not available on DVD. This is one of the best movies of all time with outstanding performances by Sam Neill and Peter Strauss. You just can't find movies like this today. It's a must see!,1215129600,3,218,4.214285714285714

7932948,5,B000057SIT,"I have always liked Sam Neill and Peter Strauss and this DVD of Kane and Abel fulfilled all my expectations. The acting was superb. The film was quite faithful to the book by Jeffrey Archer and for a telemovie of its time was very well done. A very touching scene by Peter Strauss as Abel when he at last met his grandson brought me to tears. Kudos to Amazon for allowing me to finally get this DVD for my viewing pleasure.

7932949,5,B000057SIT,"I saw this mini-series when it originally aired on TV in the '80's. I was glued to my seat every, consecutive night it came on!  I've been an avid Peter Strauss fan since the '70's, enjoying such work as wonderful as: 'Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'Angel On My Shoulder', 'Jericho Mile', '83 Hours 'Til Dawn', 'Fugitive Among us', 'Men Don't Tell', 'Thicker Than Blood', 'Reunion', 'A Father's Choice', 'Trial:The Price of Passion' and 'Flight of Black Angel', just to name a few. I recorded ""Kane & Abel"" on VCR at the time it aired, but videos blur over the years. So, I've been looking for it on DVD for almost 10 years. Will someone please explain to me why no production company has bothered to remaster ""Kane & Abel"" the complete mini-series in U.S.A. DVD version format? What is with this foreign availability crap, special machine required and such? What the heck is that about?! Peter Strauss is American, even if Sam Neill isn't! With all the garbage being put out today, I can't believe this particular WORK of ART has not been deemed WORTHY of DVD publication. If I had the equipment, I'd put it out there myself!...Not just for this series but all the GREAT TV mini-series(es) shown over two decades ('70's, '80's) that I've longed to see again: 'Evergreen' (Lesley Ann Warren), '79 Park Avenue' (Lesley Ann Warren), 'Studs Lonigan' (Lisa Pelikan), 'The Rise & Fall of Legs Diamond' (Ray Danton, Warren Oates), 'Scruples' (Lindsay Wagner) & so many others.",1467504000,,1497,4.8023255813953485

7932951,5,B000057SIT,This is one of the best mini-series ever made -- I had read the book (which I just read again recently) and was not at all disappointed in its adaptation for TV.  I'm delighted it has become available on DVD and enjoyed the second viewing as much as the first.  I'm disappointed that Amazon doesn't  sell this in a version made for US DVD players -- it IS available in Region I format and can be found easily with an on line search.,1412294400,,432,4.180722891566265
