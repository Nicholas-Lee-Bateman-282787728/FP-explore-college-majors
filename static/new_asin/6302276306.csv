The information is presented in three parts.  In the first part, the material is introduced by the actor Chevy Chase.  He was a patient of  Dr. Root's and endorses the program. Chase also provides a few laughs in this segment where Dr. Root talks about the anatomy of the back. The second section has the do's and don'ts for avoiding back pain. Finally, the last section shows the 10-step exercise program with Dr. Root working with two people who are doing the exercises as he explains them.
This program has helped me, and I can honestly say that my back is stronger because of the 15 minute daily routine.",1027382400,3,869,4.515923566878981
