8071771,2,B000A0LAK4,"This isn't a B picture, it's a C picture. The editing is really bad. Lots of dead space. The writing is very syrupy and drags the story down to a crawl. Plot isn't smooth. Just avoid it unless you're really desperate for entertainment.",1397520000,,235,4.488372093023256
8071772,2,B000A0LAK4,"Even considering the time this movie was made, it was trite and boring.  Very predictable ending.  Also, this movie does not belong under the decade of the 60's.  More like it was made in the 40's or even late 30's.",1392940800,,215,4.325
8071773,4,B000A0LAK4,"This picture exhibits the same strain of pessimistic fatalism that underpins Edgar Ulmer's ""Detour."" Robert Lowery's sullen demeanor is perfect for the role of the blue ribbon heel, Isabel Jewell is on hand to do her reliable turn as the cynical doxy, and there are a couple of lively tap numbers thrown in for good measure during a night club sequence.

The hopeless moodiness of a factory town cabaret is effectively established throughout.

Pair it with ""Detour"" and you'll have the perfect downbeat double bill, provided you accompany it with a steady stream of Chesterfield cigarette smoke, and a couple of quickly downed ""side-cars."" Good job Monogram.",1177977600,,658,5.140186915887851
8071774,5,B000A0LAK4,"Wow, the girl in this film really takes matters into her own hands. When she finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her, she shoots him dead! The rest of the film is about her trying to avoid going to jail. There is a lot of romantic tension at the start of the film and then a good deal of suspense as the plot unfolds. It's sort of a girl movie, but I'm a girl so I liked it.",1154044800,,377,3.7848101265822787
8071775,5,B000A0LAK4,"There is not a lot of star power in this romantic coming of age flick, but the story moves along at a good clip and the direction is remarkably good for what is really just an early exploitation movie.

You have the typical tale of a girl meeting the wrong guy, realizing she's getting used and then going balistic. In some ways it reminded me of that moive about the playboy bunny from a few years back.

That nothwishstanding, it's a classic movie in the old hollywood tradition and it's enjoyable to watch the soap opera plot play itself out.",1146873600,,545,4.44
