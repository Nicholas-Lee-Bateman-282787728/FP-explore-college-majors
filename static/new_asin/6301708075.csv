346277,5,6301708075,"I loved Sunday nights with The Wonderful World of Disney when I was a kid.  I do not remember seeing this one so I ordered it to add to my collection.  I watched it with my 17 year old daughter and both of us thought it quite well done.  It peaks your interest about what was popular music for the time but what is now considered ""classical"".",1353369600,2,342,4.074626865671642

346279,5,6301708075,"I thought I knew most of Walt Disney's output, but this one was a new one to me.  I must have been too young when it first aired.

This film was not only a complete surprise, it was an utter delight as well. The period costumes and settings are well done. The acting is good. Kerwin Mathews does a fine job as Strauss, Jr. and Brian Aherne is top-notch as the domineering father.

Much of the film is given over to the wonderful Strauss melodies.  This will either delight or annoy, depending on the viewer's taste, but for me, I couldn't get enough of this enchanting music.  Bravo to Walt Disney for presenting a program geared more toward adults than kids, but one which kids could easily follow and learn about the life of this musical genius.  It serves the dual purpose of being both entertaining and educational.

This was my first taste of the Disney Generations Collection.  I hope this series continues and more bygone Disney treasures get released really soon.",1340323200,5,971,4.604651162790698
346280,5,6301708075,"I'm a conductor / musician. I first saw this movie about 20 years ago as a VHS rental and loved it then. I've been hoping for a digital upgrade the past 10 years and HERE IT IS! Although it's not hi def the picture and sound has been preserved as well as possible (I'm sure). The Vienna Symphony performed the score so it's truly from the Viennese heart. Most of the information is historically accurate and Disney has done an excellent job dramatizing the events. As a music teacher, one of my favorite scenes is where Johann has just moved out on his own and is teaching violin lessons for a living; being paid with sausage, bread and wine. I highly recommend this to any fan of old Disney movies and/or to musicians and conductors.",1332720000,6,734,4.444444444444445
346281,3,6301708075,"I've always enjoyed ""The Waltz King"" and had been looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Unfortunately, they used a very old and very red print for this release on the ""Generations"" label. It's really unfortunate that Disney didn't see fit to giving this film (taken from the two-part television episodes of 1963) the treatment it deserved. Some of the gowns and sets would have been beautiful if the colors had been restored - instead, everything looks like it was shot through rose-tinted glasses.",1326672000,14,497,4.928571428571429
346282,5,6301708075,"I watched this film originally on TV when it first came out (it was in two parts as I recall) and was very impressed....to the extent that I still remember it in detail to this day.  (Actually at age 16 this might have been my first exposure to the Strauss waltz) It's a heartwarming story and the sound track, costumes, and sets are excellent.  And wow, Senta Berger is just gorgeous!

I doubt if this film will ever be reissued on DVD.  However, if you google it there are some high quality transfers from VHS to DVD-R that are available from private sellers for about $10.",1239494400,2,575,4.39622641509434
346283,5,6301708075,"BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: This made for television project was aimed at a more adult audience than the typical Disney project. Walt Disney personally gave the green light to the project, but after his death these type of projects were not part of the new managments idea of Disney anymore, and that is a shame. Walt had a much broader variety of film product than most people realizze today. The script he approved was by Disney studio writer Maurice Tombragel. Maurice came to the Disney Studios, already succesful at network television writing for popular westerns such as Bat Masterson, and stayed at the company for 9 years. His scripts for Disney included the theatrical release ""Moon Pilot"", as well as episodes of the weekly Disney show including ""Bristle Face"", and but he started with episodes of the well written ""Elfego Baca"".  He based the Waltz King script on a story by Fritz Eckhardt. As was the practice by Walt Disney at the time, the film crew, supporting cast, costumers, art directors, set builders and decorators were all local people from the community where the project was filmed with the exception of the writer a few of the actors and the director.  Walt strove for authenticity and culture in this program and it showed. The entire picture was filmed on location in Vienna, Austria and at the Wien Film Rosenhuget Studios in Vienna.  The music was arranged and conducted from the works of Strauss by Helmuth Froschauer, and performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The show was filmed to be a two-episode show on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color on NBC,  and premiered on October 7 & November 3 of 1963. The two episodes were edited together as a 94 minute movie and released theatrically overseas. It aired as a television repeat on the Walt Disney show on August 1 & 8, 1971. It was released in the movie edited version to the VHS rental market in 1986, and as of this date has not been released again. This would be highly worthy of a DVD release, and I heartily recommend.

THE PLOT: Drama, romance, in this bio-pic. This movie was so good,  I only wish I had seen it sooner.  It is the biography of Johann Strauss, Jr., the famous Viennese composer. Strauss was raised in the shadow of his famous father, a successful composer of his own right. Senior Strauss forbids his son to seek music as a career, feeling the negative side of celebrity and a musician's life is harmful. As his son attempts to seek this career the father's fear turns into jealousy as he tries to use is extensive connections in the music worked to sabotage his son and he forces his son to leave home.  As junior becomes a starving musician and selling violin lessons for food while he writes, he meets a famous woman opera singer, who begins to help him in his career to undo the damage of his father.  Strauss will have to work even harder to be the famous Waltz King, and find love. I really enjoyed this film in my recent viewing. The city of Vienna and its concert halls combined with the period costumes are stunning in their beauty, and would almost steal the show if it had not been for the terrific script and acting. And the music, the wonderful music... Even if you are not a fan of classical music it will sweep you away.",1213747200,29,3249,4.587931034482758
346284,5,6301708075,"My siblings and I watched this film over and over as young kids. It's not the type of movie you'd expect little children to enjoy, but we did. I fell in love with Johann Strauss Jr. and wished I were the beautiful, talented Henriette. I memorized all the songs in the film. For years, it has been my dream to visit Vienna. Most people want to go to Vienna to see ""The Sound of Music"" sights, but after you watch ""Waltz King,"" those will be the only scenes in your mind. Beautifully done. I'm waiting with bated breath for the DVD!",1167177600,16,530,4.257425742574258
346285,4,6301708075,"The city of Vienna has never looked more beautiful or the music of Johann Strauss, Jr. sounded more thrilling than they do in this filmed biography of THE WALTZ KING. Johann Sr. (Brian Aherne), a successful composer, forbids his precocious son (nicknamed ""Schani"") to pursue a similar career in music. When Schani (Kerwin Matthew) sells his first composition to a beautiful opera singer (Senta Berger) and subsequently falls in love with the diva, the elder Strauss, angry and jealous, forces his son to leave home. Struggling to survive as a violin teacher in order to pursue his aspirations as a composer/conductor, the youth finds his artistic efforts sabatoged at every turn by his domineering father. But the elder Strauss greatly underestimates his son's talents, determination, and will to succeed!

Running Time =  94 minutes/Color

Great encouragement for all those who wish to pursue a career in music to persevere. (7 and up)",1102809600,20,936,5.144736842105263

I purchased one copy for myself and another to surprise my sister who also had been looking for it.  As soon as I got home, I watched it with my hubby and we were both elated with the quality of the film, the gorgeous music and the story.  I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of purchasing a copy.  Some people commented that the color and sound were not very good; I found both to be excellent, as good as the day the film was made, I'm sure!  Overall, I was very happy with my copy and my sister was speechless when she received my surprise in the mail.  Wish I had been there to see her reaction!

346322,3,6301708075,"The story is a typical romantic biopic.  Some of the facts depicted differ signficantly from the biography as presented in the Wikipedia, though the battles with his father appear accurate.  The DVD is not sourced from good material.  The colors are often faded and the sound has a narrow frequency range.  However, the music of Strauss comes through and the story is enjoyable.  Of particular interest was the spectacular sets and the dancing.  One can learn much about how to choreograph large groups of dancers from watching this movie.  Also the costumes were amazing even with the sub par production values of the DVD.  It is a pleasant movie.  My wife and I enjoyed watching it.",1380412800,4,684,4.827586206896552

346326,2,6301708075,"I have always held Walt Disney Pictures as one of the greatest studios and their releases a MUST own. I was so happy to discover they had decided to provide ON-DEMAND DVD titles of older Disney films not avilable in wide distribution just like the Warner Brothers Archive collection, and Universal, and Fox studios have done. I own on-demand titles from all those studios, and although they are standard definition sources, the prints they have used for transfer have been of the best quality, very sharp picture and superb sound, and with the original color saturation. I was so happy to find the forgotten ""THE WALTZ KING"" available  from the ""DISNEY GENERATIONS COLLECTION"", but terribly dissapointed to see they used a very faded and pinkish looking print as the source. A friend of mine used to own a somewhat worn but otherwise gorgeous IB TECHNICOLOR 16mm print of this movie with absolutely perfect colors. I must say I am embarrassed that Disney has released such a substandard product. Shame on you folks. Where is the Disney pride for perfection. This is a great movie and it deserves better. I probably will not purchase any other titles from this collection for fear I will be receiving faded prints on DVD.",1363824000,22,1220,4.837320574162679

346329,5,6301708075,"Mr. William J. Cottor was right. I had received my copy of `The Waltz King' yesterday morning, 22/02/13. I saw it last night and I was shocked when on my 14foot screen flushed those beautiful pictures which in a way were ruined, precisely as Mr. Cotter had described very well.
As a matter of fact the version I saw which naturally was distributed in the European cinemas in the early 60's was different. It even included, if I remember well the Vienna Boys Choir and the last scene in the film was the confrontation between Johann Strauss Sr. when his son Johann Strauss Jr. played the The Radezky March in honour of his father. I very much enjoyed watching the film on this DVD I recieved which I had been searching for , for many years. Hearing the music, (The Sound Was Good) was fantastic ***** although with certain feelings due to the same reason mentioned above; but they did not take the pleasure of enjoying the story and the music.
I also hope that those two TV films which were for television transmission in the early 60's will be on sale very soon.
