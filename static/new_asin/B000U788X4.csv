2917156,5,B000U788X4,"Fantastic Movie. Very well done Salter Street.

I actually ran into the actors while they were filming (I was a block away from the set at a convenience store), but didn't know it was for this movie until I saw it.",1285459200,,214,4.219512195121951
2917157,3,B000U788X4,"THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS VIDEO WAS ALL THE PREVIEWS AT THE BEGINNING....AND I COULDN'T SKIP RIGHT TO THE MOVIE.
IT WAS WELL DONE AND THE FACTS WERE ACURATE BUT THERE WAS QUITE ALOT OF FANTASY.  HOWEVER IT PROBABLY MADE FOR A BETTER STORY.",1266710400,2,253,4.382978723404255
2917158,4,B000U788X4,"Few today remember Halifax, Nova Scotia, was almost wiped off the map in a ship collison during W.W.I which should never have happened.  The acting is more than adequate and you can't tire of watching Tamara Hope, a Canadian actress clearly headed for the big-time.",1242691200,3,265,4.888888888888889
2917159,3,B000U788X4,"The 3 hour movie was okay.  The screenplay centers around a single family. I suppose to provide a cohesive storyline rather than short segments of the lives of many people.  Many occurences referenced in the book of the same name are portrayed; although, I don't believe the movie quite conveys the impact that the explosion had upon Halifax and its citizens.  In an effort to provide a more ""feel good"" ending, one character is depicted as being within 200 yards of the ship and out in the open when it exploded and yet only sustained minor facial cuts.",1222732800,4,554,4.63265306122449
2917160,4,B000U788X4,"The Halifax Explosion happened during World War I, on the morning of December 6, 1917, when a ship loaded with munitions exploded in the harbor. Large sections of the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia were destroyed. Thousands were maimed or killed. It was the largest man-made explosion in history until the detonation of the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima in 1945. This is a fictionalized, but realistic, movie about it. It's well done and definitely worth seeing.",1196812800,12,463,5.025974025974026
2917161,5,B000U788X4,"Excellent. Watched it 3 times in a row (so far) today. If the story isn't tugging on the heart strings, it has you fumbling to pick up your dropped jaw. Intense special effects - I can still hear the explosions. I'm hooked. This movie was so intriguing that I am now going to have to exhaust every library and book store/web site for more information. Okay, 'nuff said. Back to the movie!",1504915200,,388,4.402777777777778
2917162,5,B000U788X4,"This was a really good film, and supposedly based on a true event. It is well made, for the era of time, and I thought the actors all did a great job overall. I never heard anything about this event until I saw this film. I highly recommend watching this one, esp. if you like learning about history.",1504396800,2,300,4.189655172413793
2917163,5,B000U788X4,Very moving. Enjoyed.,1504396800,,21,6.333333333333333
2917164,2,B000U788X4,"Got bored about halfway through.  Seems to have very little to do with actual history.  A lot of soap box anti-war speeches delivered in what are presented as ordinary conversations.  Nothing wrong with that, but seemed kind of cheap in the context of the movie/mini-series.  There are plenty of films directly about WWI that do a better job with this, and in a more fitting way.  Over all it's pretty much just a vaguely anti-war and rather dull soap opera using the explosion in Halifax as it's backdrop/excuse.",1503360000,,513,4.784090909090909
2917165,5,B000U788X4,"This is an excellent movie, and I would recommend it.",1485734400,,53,4.4
2917166,4,B000U788X4,"Not as good as the book, but what movie ever is?",1469059200,,48,3.4545454545454546
2917167,3,B000U788X4,I liked it from the perspective that there is nothing about the Halifax Explosion out there.  The stories of spying and and relationships as well as the quick rebuild of Halifax ruin the overall historic credibility of the movie.  If you know nothing about the explosion this would be an interesting movie.  If you know a scintilla about the actual events you'll be disappointed.,1462147200,,379,4.890625
2917168,5,B000U788X4,Good story,1441065600,,10,4.5
2917169,5,B000U788X4,"What a story! So sorry to say that it is a true story. It explains why the friendship between Nova Scotia and Boston, MA.
It is truly shocking! The story is shown on Canada TV often.",1439769600,,182,4.083333333333333
2917170,5,B000U788X4,Great Book - - tells how BOSTON still is given annual CHRISTMAS TREE.,1437177600,,69,4.384615384615385
2917171,5,B000U788X4,Fantastic story wonderfully portrayed. A must see for all people.,1431129600,,65,5.6
2917172,3,B000U788X4,"This is  a good movie and if I had not read' "" The Curse of the Narrows"" by Laura M. MacDonald first I would have enjoyed it even more.  The movie mostly follows the events of one family and so is limited in it's scope and you don't get the same depth of detail and suspense that you  do in Ms. MacDonald's book  but, if this is an event that draws you in then this should be part of your collection.

If this story intrigues you, you might want to read "" Under a Flaming Sky: The Great Hinckley Firestorm of 1894 "" by Daniel James Brown and /or ""Fire and Brimstone: The North Butte Mining Disaster of 1917 by Michael Punke",1413158400,5,623,4.073770491803279
2917173,5,B000U788X4,Shattered City The Halifax Explosion is part of Nova Scotian history. I grew up hearing about the great explosion that devistated Nova Scotia. It is part of my history and I love the movie.,1389657600,,189,4.588235294117647
2917174,5,B000U788X4,We visited Halifax this summer and I had never heard about this horrible event.  I enjoyed the movie which showed more about what actually happened.,1388448000,,148,4.92
2917175,5,B000U788X4,"Good story. Had relatives you died in this explosion.  Have heard story many times, great to see in movie format.",1387756800,,113,4.65
2917176,5,B000U788X4,"I first heard about the Halifax explosion from the book ""The Birth House"" by Ami McKay - a well-written book well worth the time. The movie is a fascinating look at the human spirit surviving a terrible disaster.",1383004800,,212,4.605263157894737
2917177,4,B000U788X4,"Having been through all the museums in Halifax and studied the literature on the tragedy, i found most of this movie very engaging.
these were great people who populated this coastal area. jw",1381708800,,191,4.818181818181818
2917178,4,B000U788X4,"A decent adaptation of the history of the explosion, and the effect of war on communities. There are some sexual themes and language, as well as some moderately graphic scenes (parents beware). I felt that the graphic content was tastefully handled to bring across the horrors of war, especially in contrast to the ignorance of communities that were far removed from the fighting. The thing that was not as well represented as it could have been was the rash of fires that broke out as a result of overturned coal stoves. The film focuses more on the explosion debris and blizzard that slowed recovery and rescue operations, but big fires were also part of the problem, especially since the new fire truck and its crew were lost on the pier when the explosion occurred. I am not as well versed in this portion of nautical history as in others, but from what I know of it, the film is not entirely accurate, but Janet Kitz and other more informed people could shed better light on the film's authenticity. One moment that was a genuine treat might be considered a little mocking, though I don't think it was at all meant that way. It could not have been an accident that the boatman who pulls up next to the fiery Mont Blanc was...well, Red Green fans will get it. ""Ka-boom!"" Apart from the explosion, though, I think the film seeks to foster a greater appreciation for the common soldier and what the price of freedom really is. That is what I liked best about the lead character.",1379462400,2,1480,4.567669172932331
2917179,5,B000U788X4,"I never knew about the Halifax explosion until I encountered this Canadian miniseries.  The special effects were decent considering when the movie was made.  Conversations among characters reveal what Canadians were thinking and feeling about the imminent U.S. entrance into World War 1, and the popularity of Marxism among young people.  Most rewarding, though, was the depiction of the greatest man-made explosion ever experienced before the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima.",1378166400,2,473,5.728571428571429
2917180,4,B000U788X4,"This movie does a pretty good job showing what every day people must have gone through when the huge explosion occurred on December 6, 1917. If you are a stickler for historical accuracy, which I am, then there will be some disappointment because the facts are not all there, nor are some things portrayed correctly. They also don't cover the tidal wave that struck the First Nations village across the water, although it is briefly mentioned.",1371513600,,443,4.842105263157895

8212317,5,B000U788X4,I had never even heard of the explosion at Halifax Harbor (in 1917) until I watched this most engrossing film.  Those who made the movie managed to weave the facts of the story into the lives of a host of interesting characters that were realistically portrayed by an outstanding cast of adult and child actors.  Shattered City  is well worth watching and far superior to most of the disaster fare available on Amazon Prime Video.,1524268800,,430,4.706666666666667
8212318,5,B000U788X4,"in a time of movies that mean nothing, this movie shines above them.",1522108800,,68,4.3076923076923075

8212320,2,B000U788X4,Has nothing in common with the actual facts regarding the explosion.,1519689600,,68,5.2727272727272725
8212321,5,B000U788X4,Great acting and showed the true courage of the people that day. This story was real.and it brought home what war is about.,1518998400,,123,4.391304347826087
8212322,5,B000U788X4,"Excellent retelling, fine acting.  A Christmas story with history and heart too often in the background of all other of history's events.",1513555200,,137,5.2272727272727275

8212324,5,B000U788X4,"Wow, what an awesome movie.  Unassumingly had everything.  Action, subtle romance, heroism, villains, compassion...the story and war situation in the background wasn't sugar coated but presented in a real way that really took the audience to the time and situation.  Had me riveted.",1508889600,,282,5.511627906976744
