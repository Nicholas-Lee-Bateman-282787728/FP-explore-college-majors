8405058,2,B003TFERDY,"Im always on the lookout for microbudget horror goodness, and after this horror/comedy effort, I know I need to keep looking. It has the typical bad acting, that didn't kill it for me. The digital FX work was mind bogglingly awful, right from the start, and used a fair amount. I have to wonder who possibly could think it was a good idea. There isn't much of a story here other than some people have died and this woman may or may not be possessed by an evil spirit. It hits every goth stereotype, obviously the person behind this movie knows nothing of the subculture, or is just a poser. So that aspect of the movie was a complete failure. The comedy aspect misses far more than they hit, but there are a couple of good laughs. No nudity and a lack of blood. It fails on a lot of levels but Ive definitely seen a lot worse. 1.5/5",1432771200,,832,4.238993710691824

If it is then you found a gem. Sure this movie has...somewhere around three plots. Sure the effects are occasionally questionably. But let me attempt to win you over with two words.
Gothic. Orgy.

Okay there isn't actually a gothic orgy, but there are a lot of laughs. Many laughs. Too many laughs. You will not be able to handle all of your laughs.",1419465600,,438,4.329268292682927
