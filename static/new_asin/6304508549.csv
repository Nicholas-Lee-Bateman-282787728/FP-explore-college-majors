896797,4,6304508549,"The temptation these days is to dust off modestly entertaining but little known films of the past, slap 'em in a nice DVD package, and market them as ""the cult classic that's finally on DVD!"" At first glance, that seems to be the case here. But I have to admit that after watching my new DVD of ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (which I ordered from Amazon after they helpfully sent me an e-mail about the movie, announcing its availability in the fashion described above), I happily added it to my growing DVD collection instead of targeting it for unloading or trade. Here are five things that this film noir fan liked, or at least found interesting, about this movie:
1) The Mike Hammer of the books, who is a man of conscience (if not pacifism), is converted here into a sleazy detective who wallows in messy divorce cases, manipulating their outcome to his advantage. One may not like this interpretation, but it's undeniably interesting and different. Funny thing, though: despite the alterations to his character, Hammer still remains somewhat likable.
2) Classical music (symphonies, opera, etc.) is heard repeatedly throughout the film, usually emanating from radios in the dwellings Hammer visits during his investigation. Don't know exactly why, but I liked the juxtaposition of hearing cultured music while watching the sleazy, brutal elements of the story unfold.
3) Hammer drives a couple of cool looking open-top convertibles during the movie, and we are sometimes treated to a sort of hovering-over-the-trunk-looking-forward view as he drives along. Most movies settle for the usual camera-in-the-backseat-looking-over-the-driver's-shoulder shot, but the innovative set up described above allows us to drive along with Hammer AND see most of the cool car's exterior, too. It's hard to describe these shots in a more specific manner, but viewers will notice and appreciate them immediately.
4) I liked the mysterious box with the strange, glowing contents that everyone is after. It's creepy and fun. Also fun to think about: the plot device of having an object that everyone badly wants is clearly inspired by ""The Maltese Falcon"", and the fact that the object here is a box with something glowing inside it in turn inspired a similar item in the film ""Pulp Fiction"" decades later!
5) It was a good move to affix the longer ending onto the DVD release of this film. Simply put (but without giving too much away here), the longer ending makes it clear whether or not our hero survives this adventure. The shorter ending (included in the DVD's ""extras"" section, so viewers can compare for themselves) is ambiguous and unsatisfying, as one could make a case either way about Hammer's fate. There is certainly a place in film noir for ambiguity, but- trust me- in this particular story it's much better to know for sure who lives and who dies.
 So, if not a true ""cult classic"", I guess I have to say that ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is nevertheless a solid entry in the private eye genre, and it delivers the goods. The movie is moody, involving, dangerous, sexy, and damned fun to watch. It has all the things one likes to see in private eye movies, but several original touches, too. Oh, yes- the DVD features a picture that is crystal clear and sharp as a knife; it looks like they made the film yesterday. In short, pick this one up.",993686400,6,3323,4.871024734982332
896798,5,6304508549,"Kiss Me Deadly is one heavily stylized, dramatic, often bruality honest, at times confusing, and often mind blowing elevator ride through one of the most often mistfied era's of American culture the 1950's! Set up as a brilliant film noir we are introduced to one stark and nerve shaking image of a bare foot young blonde in a trench-coat and nothing else on a moon-lit highway. She finally hails down Mike Hammer(Meeker in the best role of his career), and for what it's worth a tale of tracking and confussion begins when the car is stopped on the road by thugs and the blonde is murdered and Hammer is left for dead. Hammer's need to find out what happened to the blonde is underscored by his own swarmy life as a seedy private eye for hire. The whole film more than seems realisistic; as if you're traveling along with Hammer as a sort of private eye in training; you visit the thugs and smell the same foul air he smells and cringe as he gets tied down and ""spread eagle"" across a bed by the same thugs who murdered the blonde he tried save that night on the side of the road. But what was the blonde running from? It was the infamous ""Manhattan Project""-what it is we truly never learn but for some strange reason it can set human flesh ablaze and even burn down a house but some how it is contained in a leather box! The film is loaded with ""real"" looking characters and for a film noir is lends the film a sense of urgency and heightens your paranoia. The film as a whole has some of the most cutting edge dialogue and direction ever put into celluloid! And as for it's reflections into life in the 50's when America was ""America"". A lot of film's of that age seem to forget the crimes against races, nuclear power, or the atom bomb. ""Kiss Me Deadly"" plays on that generations fears and insecurites and in the end it makes for a film that is still as powerful and violent as it was some fourty years ago! Oh and if this review seems a bit confusing and dis-jointing, you will too after watching this brilliant film unfold.",993340800,3,2030,4.358839050131926
896799,5,6304508549,"From Sam Spade to Phillip Marlowe to Jake Gittes, no cinema private eye is treated so disdainfully as Mike Hammer in ""Kiss Me Deadly"". An icon of the Mc Carthy 1950's, Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer hates only one thing more than commies, namely the other half of the species, women. To their credit, director Robert Aldrich and screenwriter A. I. Bezzerides see through the patriotic veneer to the fascist thug lurking beneath. The film follows Hammer as he blunders through a series of plot mishaps, smashing faces, abusing women, and making all the wrong choices - disastrously, up to and including the apocalyptic finale. Crew-cut Ralph Meeker swaggers through the role in appropriately dim fashion, with a perpetual sneer and a muscle bound pelvic lead - forever beyond self reflection. This is a Hammer that lives up to its name.
All of this would be only half an equation had not director Aldrich and production crew pulled off the cautionary tale with such flair and artistry. Noir elements abound, with  emphasis on creative camera angles and complex set compositions that keep eyes glued to the screen. Night time  shots are beautifully realized and integrated into the seedy plot  that is Hammer's appropriate milieu. Critics of the day panned the film, expecting a more conventional style and heroic Hammer. Few films however have been more ahead of their time in both style and content, nor was anyone with the possible exception of Nicholas Ray more attuned to the psychic instability that underlay the outward confomism of the period. Though not a masterpiece, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" needs no rationalizing. It remains one of the eccentric gems of the modern American screen.",991267200,12,1683,5.025089605734767

We may be in  disagreement on the assessment of Jerry Lewis' ""genius"", but as  for the importance of this film's influence on susbsequent cinema, I have  to agree with the French on this one! Ralph Meeker's sneeringly existential  and Brandoesque Mike Hammer persona in this film has been imitated many  times but never matched.

Although the differences are small, they are not without  interest.  Whether we gain anything from seeing slightly more of 'Pandora'  being incinerated is debatable, but in the longest version (shown by the  BBC on its Moviedrome series about five years ago) there is a clear  implication that Hammer and girlfriend escape, while the shortest seems to  suggest that the genie emerging from the box is about to consume  everything.  Has any historian of film noir written about this?  Do we know  what Aldrich intended?",960940800,2,751,5.115702479338843

The book of course written by Mickey Spillane has it's plot turned upside down 3/4  into the movie where it get's into sci-fi territory. The film had trouble being approved by the MPAA and the Legion of Decency which was going to give the movie it's dreaded ""C"" rating--Condemned  because of it's violence and smoldering sexuality. Criterion  always does a great job with their restoration of movies but I do believe they cut out part of the flaming car wreck over the cliff scene where Hammer miraculously escapes with his life climbing up a ravine  and of course the climax of the film where you don't get the shock value of one of the most surreal endings of all time in motion picture history  if you see the alternate ending version..

896919,5,6304508549,"If viewed strictly as a contempory production, this movie would seem as borderline laughable.  The special effects are almost hilarious.  I do not wish to risk being a ""spoiler"".  So I am being intentionally vague.  In the movie there is inert material that screams like a monster.  In the context of a metaphor it is clumsily appropriate.  The movie is kitsch by today's standards.

However, if viewed through the prism of Hollywood History and The History of Film Noir, this is a true classic.  The movie reflects the hard boiled private detective genre of literature of the 1920s, 1940s and 1950s.  The movie projects a debased, amoral, society.  Mike Hammer, the private detective tramples through the movie like an unbridled avenger, as much antihero as hero.  Mike Hammer makes ""Joe Friday"" look like ""Officer Friendly"" from the community relations bureau.

As a retired police officer / detecive, I am greatly offended by the concept of a private detective running amok and I NEVER tolerated that.  There is no point in having Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights if a private person is allowed to trample them.  However I truly enjoy the viewing experience from the standpoint of art.  I state this in the same context of a modern viewer watching this movie through the lens of Hollywood History and Film Noir as opposed to simply watching a modern movie for simple entertainment.  I love his movie as a ""time piece"" and as a prime example of film noir.  However please do not view this movie anticipating you are about to see ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

think it's one of the best but it's a strange film noir movie and pretty rough at times. Meeker who I think is a great actor plays it cool but
hard and not really likeable or nice person I thought. The movie gets all Sci Fi with the 'glowing box' especially with the ending you
would think you just missed a Sci Fi movie if you just saw the ending. This one has both versions but I don't see much difference.

897077,4,6304508549,"KISS ME DEADLY is a low budget film noir released by United Artists in 1955.  Vaguely based on a Mickey Spillane novel and directed by Robert Aldrich, who is perhaps most famous for WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE, it offers the story of low-rent but hard-hitting private detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker), who picks up a terrified young woman (Cloris Leachman, her film debut) on the side of the road.  They are kidnapped, the woman is tortured to death, and they are sent over hillside in Hammers carbut Hammer survives and determines to unravel the mystery, partly because hes tired of working penny ante cases and partly because he seems to feel some responsibility toward the dead woman.

The first fifteen minutes of the film are grippingbut it thereafter runs into a series of character sketches as Hammer tries to trace the background of the young woman, who she was and what she had that would make someone kill her so brutally.  The performers (including Maxine Cooper, Gaby Rodgers, Albert Decker, and Paul Stewart among others) give first rate turns, but the script merely leads from one character to another without going anywhere in particular  until about last fifteen minutes of the film, when KISS ME DEADLY suddenly gathers itself into one of the most  bizarre plot turns imaginable.  For some years only a cut version of the films original ending was available, and quite a savage ending it was.  Now the original ending is available, and while it softens the ending a bit, it doesnt soften it by much.

Although the center portion of the film is uneven, it is well performed, and the whole thing moves with such speed that, while you might be confused about who is who and why they are there, you never really question itat least not much.  It is also interesting to note that KISS ME DEADLY was heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcocks concept of the MacGuffin, and that the MacGuffin in the film influenced everything from RADERS OF THE LOST ARC to MULHOLLAND DR to REPO MAN to PULP FICTION.

At the time, KISS ME DEADLY ran into all sorts of censorship problems, what with its mixture of cold blooded violence and women of easy virtue, not to mention a profanity that, mild by todays standards, is surprising to hear in a 1955 movie.  But ultimately, KISS ME DEADLY isn't in the top tier of film noir.  Its too uneven and too loosely structured to compete with the likes of, say, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE.  But its an interesting watch, and fans of the genreespecially the gritty style of noirwill enjoy it.  Criterion Collection does a nice job of the film with a good restoration and several bonuses, most notably a audio track.  Recommended.

897237,4,6304508549,"KISS ME DEADLY, (1955). In this violent 106 minute black and white thriller, which is considered a classic of film noir, tough  sleazy Los Angeles detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) picks up Christina, a scantily clad, deeply frightened hitchhiker (Cloris Leachman).  His car is then forced over a cliff. Days later, he awakens from unconsciousness to find his doomed  passenger dead -- but it wasn't the fall that killed her. Hammer sets out to find the woman's deadly secret and  her murderers, who had tortured her for her secret. He thinks it might be a big story, meaning big money for him, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation is interested.  So he ignores explicit messages that he should mind his own business. This crime drama was adapted by A.I. Bezzerides from Mickey Spillane's bestselling novel of the same name, and directed by Robert Aldrich, THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, who was to carve out quite a career for himself in mens action adventure flicks.  My television set found English subtitles although the disk does not advertise them.

This film, set in and around Los Angeles, certainly opens memorably, as the credits scroll upside down, and the Leachman-Meeker introduction is striking.  Director Aldrich has made full use of the vocabulary of black and white film noir, giving us atmospheric lighting  and shadows and numerous moody deep focus scenes. He has also made full use of his LA settings, getting particular atmospherics out of its Bunker Hill area, which once housed the cream of society, but had, by this time, fallen to house the dregs, and has now been disappeared by urban renewal and a famous, beautiful new concert hall, though the tram, and the long flights of steps that reached Bunker Hill still remain to this day: Ive found them.  In fact, film critics, for whatever their reasons, generally say that the only acceptable modern full-color  films noir are set in LA; but theres no question but that this suspenseful mystery helped set the perimeters of the genre.  Aldrich feels certain enough to play with the genre.  At one point Velda, Hammers girlfriend, remarks about the body count, as people struggle to find the mysterious ""great whatsit,"" even though nobody knows what it is.  So take that, Alfred Hitchcock, great Anglo-American director of thrillers, who has put forward the theory of the macguffin, that which the film is about, as everyone struggles to find it.

The atmosphere of the film is also well-set by the appropriate cars and clothes, although, of course, they were contemporaneous with its making.  But there are additional details too.  At one point Hammer buys, as he apparently frequently does, popcorn from a street vendor for 10 .  There is also a nifty early answering machine, elegantly set into the wall of Hammers office: I lived through the period in question and have never seen anything like it.  Aldrich has come up with numerous nifty touches: a  bit of business with a cigarette pack. With a trunk.  Not one, but two barefooted pretty young girls running around, supposedly naked beneath their outerwear: a trench coat and a house coat.  In fact, more acting with feet, legs and shoes than I have  seen in any  movie aside from the French filmmaker Robert Bressons AU HASARD BALTHAZAR.  A fistfight at oceans edge.  The later radio broadcast of a fight that Hammer had previously discussed with the  friend training one of the fighters.  The presence of more urban ethnic immigrants, and blacks, than I believe was common at the time.

However, there was sure no studio splurging on Aldrichs acting talent.  Headliner Meeker (PATHS OF GLORY, THE DIRTY DOZEN), was always considered more a supporting player than a star.  Second billed  Albert Dekker as Dr. G. E. Soberin, also played in THE WILD BUNCH and THE KILLERS.  Other somewhat familiar male faces include Wesley Addy as LA Police Lieutenant Pat Murphy, Strother Martin, Jack Elam, Paul Stewart, and Juano Hernandez.  The briefly-seen Leachman was the only one of the female stars to have any further career.

At the  rip roaring  alternate conclusion of the film that is preferred today, Hammers girlfriend Velda looks back, from the safety of the ocean, to a beach house exploding in flames.  A few minutes before, Dr. Soberin has explicitly told us, in case we didn't know it, of the biblical story of Lots wife, who looked back, when she was warned not to, and was turned into a pillar of salt.

People were getting radiation sickness slowly just having the box. As one victim got sick the next would haplessly possess the ""gift"". Also there was more of Leachman in the opening scenes that was cut. I guess the censors had to cut out the idea that deadly carriers could kill a city through technology running amok...but of course that couldn't happen today in any sense.

This is an often overlooked film noir classic, and it is extremely influential. The ""MacGuffin"" that the story revolves around is a mysterious glowing thing in a briefcase, and the seeds of this idea can be found at the root of other classic movies such as 'Repo Man' and 'Pulp Fiction'.  The events that lead Mike Hammer into the case are heartily reminiscent of some scenes from Frank Miller's 'Sin City', and I doubt that is accidental.

Kiss Me Deadly is an excellent story filmed well. The creeping McCarthyist paranoia of the age, Cold War annihilation fears...all of them are examined under the guise of a simple detective yarn.  Should be right up there with 'Key Largo', 'The Big Sleep', and other oft mentioned classics of the genre.",1356652800,4,992,4.683908045977011

First, it is an absolute joy to look at -- so much in this movie is stylized that it's exhilarating to be exposed to camera work and the dialogue. Second, there are many aspects that are novel or intriguing: The answering machine on the wall, Velda doing ballet moves at home, Hammer looking at books while Schubert's Unfinished Symphony is blaring. And of course, there's the most intriguing element of the film: That mysterious box that shouldn't be opened. On the other hand, much of the plot is unexplained; in particular, many of the links are never made clear or rationalized. That means that as we get deeper into solving the mystery, we really don't get deeper but rather switch to just another mystery that seems tangential to the previous one. Ralph Meeker just doesn't cut it as Hammer, in my view, though most of the supporting cast are excellent. An aimless noir wannabe with a science fictional conclusion, Kiss Me Deadly has enough offbeat elements going for it to make it interesting, but it's also got some heavy baggage that keeps tripping it up. Special features include a condensed version of a video documentary on Mickey Spillane and Mike Hammer, interviews with screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides, and a fascinating short documentary about the Bunker Hill neighborhood of Los Angeles.

897336,5,6304508549,"Kiss Me Deadly, based on one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, is classic noir.  It's brutal, somewhat surreal, and visually stimulating.  Director Robert Aldrich knew how to use a camera angle or tiles to make an image stranger and more lingering.

Mike Hammer, as played by Ralph Meeker, is good looking, friends with black people (notable for the time), and always willing to banter with a beautiful woman.  But he's also a sadist, incredibly stupid, and trades on his mistress's body for information and money.

The film begins when Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman, billed as her first role) runs in front of Hammer's car wearing nothing but a trench coat.  He quickly discovers that she's escaped from an insane asylum, but doesn't manage to get her to the bus stop as she wanted before they're ambushed and she's tortured to death.  It's an opening that perfectly encapsulates the movie.  The credits scroll backwards, a real visual trick.  They're accompanied by Leachman's panting, brought on by desperation, fear, exertion - violence - but it sounds sexual.  And the violence is offscreen - the only thing we see of Christina during the torture is her legs - but still intense.

Kiss Me Deadly is a great film.  The plot is strange and sometimes incoherent, but that doesn't dampen the power of the whole.  (Particularly because the movie doesn't really linger over scenes - it's quite fast paced.)  I'm quite fond of the film's femme fatale.  I won't give away which woman it is, but it's a great performance.  Strange, but that fits Kiss Me Deadly.  It's also fun to watch Kiss Me Deadly because of its influence on film.  I loved spotting familiar elements in their original incarnation.  Two more modern movies that obviously pay homage to it are Repo Man and Pulp Fiction, both of which I love.",1350864000,,1817,4.840909090909091

897437,5,6304508549,"I love film. Made up until about 1959. I'd planned for ages to amass a reputable film noir collection, and the bug bit about a month ago. I made a list.
This film was down the list somewhat, because I had not seen it and the cast seemed sort of mediocre. Reading the great online Amazon reviews has shaped my choices profoundly. So I took a chance on this. And IT MADE MY HAIR CURL!! (And my hair's straight!)
Extremely noir it is, but much more. The pace goes less crackingly than some other films noirs, but the plot is very dense and convoluted in a most satisfying way (akin to 'The Big Sleep' with Bogart & Bacall, I suppose.) It is not in the same category of noir, in terms of production values and budget, as such alleged classics of the genre as ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" It lacks the darkling cinematography of ""The Big Combo"". But it shows us a thoroughly dirty LA, a cast of unpleasantly unwholesome females (no delicately beautiful Jean Wallace here, as in ""Big Combo"".) In fact, no classy or good-looking dame to be seen.
We come now to Ralph Meeker. His Mike Hammer is hard-boiled but not in an overt way, like Cagney's Cody Jarrett in 'White Heat', for one. He is just one masculine, selfish, obtuse private eye... maybe a little bit weary of the female form, the female bag of tricks. Nevertheless, despite his cool, even stolid demeanor, for me he's the sexiest, handsomest gumshoe EVER.
The camera work is highly competent but doesn't strive to be overly-arty; in places it's almost surreal. The film has such a depressing air to it that I wonder if ANY film qualifies better to be film noir par excellence.
And the ending... the restored ending, that is... well, my hair will never be the same again. WOW! All I can say is, FIVE solid stars. And KABLOOEY!!!",1328486400,9,1808,4.532110091743119
897438,5,6304508549,"Mickey Spillane, the man whose book was mangled in this film, purportedly said he never had anyone with a mustache in his stories because he didn't know how to spell it; he said the same about attache, as in attache case.  Regardless, being a slavish adherent of Spillane's writings, the first two times I watched the movie KISS ME DEADLY I felt aggrieved at what the writer/director team had done to Spillane's personalized private eye concept.

Those who've read the book can see the skeleton of Spillane's novel shaping key scenes in the film: the girl in the raincoat running down the highway in the opening frames; Hammer tied face down on a bed for a long while; the fiery conclusion (the book and the movie's endings differ vastly but both involve fire).  The end is not the only time the film diverges from the novel; Meeker could've played a great Mike Hammer in another vehicle than this, but he's not Mike Hammer in this particular role other than in name only; likewise Pat and Velma whose last names are changed in the script. I thought it out of character Meeker's Hammer didn't fetch the mechanic a crack upside the chops the second time he uttered, 'Va va voom!""

But it doesn't kill the movie, I like it as a standalone entity.  I've watched it four or five times now.  It grew on me, not perfect but enjoyable enough to re-watch every few years.  I'd rather live in a world that had the book AND the film rather one with just the book.

KISS ME DEADLY uses the most standard and unimaginative camera angles, like it was filmed in a hurry over a long weekend, however it is wonderfully photographed with foregrounds and backgrounds in startlingly crystal clear focus, the way Perry Mason was filmed a few years later.  I'd venture the fact alone that the movie was shot in b&w is what categorically makes it a noir classic.  BLADE RUNNDER and CHINATOWN have hazy, often drab color palettes and they're much more noir than KISS ME DEADLY despite not being filmed in b&w.

Nor is KISS ME DEADLY in the the same league as THE BIG SLEEP and MALTESE FALCON, but it is a solid entry in the history of Hollywood noir.",1325376000,2,2127,4.527415143603133

897442,2,6304508549,"""Kiss me Deadly"" was made in 1955 and it ranks as one of the poorest examples of film noir and maybe the worst film portrayal of Mike Hammer.

Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer was created in 1947 (""I, the Jury"") at the very peak of film noir and he went on to be featured in numerous films including ""I, the Jury"" (1953), ""My Gun is Quick"" (1957), and ""The Girl Hunters"" (1963). He was played by Biff Elliot (1953), Robert Bray (1957), Armand Assante (1982), and even Mickey Spillane (1963). The character is most associated with Stacey Keach who played him in film (1983, 2003) and on TV (1984-7), although personally I prefer Darren McGavin's interpretation (1957-8).

Unlike his fellow literary gum shoes Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, Hammer tends to be more pragmatic and brutal, however, as portrayed by Ralph Meeker, Hammer is reduced to a psychopathic sadist who makes his living by pimping out his secretary/girl friend. It's no wonder the novel's author discredited the film.

The film has a great cast, but the poor script leaves them with little screen time and even less to do. If you sneeze you can miss great character actors like Cloris Leachman, Strother Martin, Jack Elam, Percy Helton, and Albert Decker, and even the longer parts given to Paul Stewart and Wesley Addy are not very meaty.

Blame it all on director Robert Aldrich (1918-83), who ultimately turned into a first rate director (""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"", ""Ulzana's Raid"", ""The Longest Yard""), but this was one of his first film outings and it was made in a mere 3 weeks and at a modest cost of $425,000. Since Aldrich was also involved in the production, he gets twice the blame.

When the film was released, film noir was past its classic period, but there are certainly good film noir from the mid 50s - ""Night of the Hunter"" (1955), ""The Killing"" (1956), ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), etc. While this film does showcase many of the film noir conventions (e.g., hero is a detective, shot on location in major urban area, lots of night scenes and unusual angles, cast of seedy characters), there really isn't a femme fatale and there is a (more or less) happy ending. Moreover, even when the film sticks to convention, the application is poor. For example, the characters are seedy but we never get a chance to see them for more than a few seconds and their true ""seediness"" is never developed. Compare these characters with the seedy crew from films like ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Killing"" and you'll see what I mean.

897567,5,6304508549,"Before there was Dirty Harry, there was Mike Hammer. The well known P.I. has enjoyed numerous iterations both in film (Armand Assante, creator Mickey Spillane) and in television (Stacy Keach, Darren McGavin). Hell, there was even a 3-D film. For my money, character actor Ralph Meeker is as good as it gets in this Robert Aldrich adaptation of Kiss Me, Deadly (with intended comma). The comma removal is just one of the changes Aldrige and screenwriter A. I Bezzerides made to Spillane's pulp novel. In the opening scene we see a barefoot woman running down a darkened highway wearing what appears to be nothing but a trench coat. She runs in front of a Jaguar roadster driven by our hero, Mike Hammer.

The woman is played by a 28 year old Cloris Leachman in her first movie. Hammer picks her up and agrees to take her to the nearest bus stop. During the drive, the opening credits roll...backwards! All the while, the woman sobs and moans. They never make it to the bus stop. They are mugged, put back in the Jag and shoved off a California cliff and left for dead. Hammer recovers but the girl doesn't which leads our P. I. to figure out what happened. Hammer is kind of a blue collar lug head as his character is written here. Still, he's smart enough to suspect a ""present"" of a shiny new '54 Corvette may be booby trapped. In between the Jag and the Corvette, Hammer also drives a MG TC or TD roadster. The writers must love their cars.

There are so many interesting details in this film that it's hard to remember it is a near perfect thriller coming at the end of the film noir era. For example, in Hammer's apartment he has a custom installed reel-to-reel answering machine built into the wall. How cool. There is also an extended scene where Hammer pounds down shots of bourbon in an all black jazz club...and seems right at home. Controversial I'm sure at the time. Speaking of controversy, Aldrich had all kinds of problems getting this film past the censors. While probably PG today, the film has a torture scene involving poor Cloris' character at the beginning, even though we only see her hanging feet and arms. Hammer is also quite the ladies man. Women fling themselves at him as if he were James Bond. In fact the characters have a lot in common. Leachman's roommate is likely not to be trusted but she is alluring and seductively played by Gaby Rogers. Like Leachman, Roger's character is always barefoot...hmm, more innuendo? Maxine Cooper plays Hammer's uh, ""secretary"" in another not so subtle hint of a ""bad"" girl. There is much to love about this stylistic thriller, not to mention a surprise ending that answers the questions suggested by the DVD jacket and movie poster about the ""H-Bomb"".",1318809600,,2717,4.634854771784233
897568,4,6304508549,"I've never read any Mickey Spillane and I haven't seen any other movies from his books so I'm virgin in this endeavor. This was a big surprise and a pleasant one at that.

Here's the scoop. Detective Mike Hammer picks up a desperate woman on a dark highway. She's dressed only in a trench coat. They talk a bit. She's mysterious and alludes to the fact she's been institutionalized to keep her quiet about something. They're run off the road. She dies. Mike's injured and the mystery deepens. She's mailed him an enigmatic letter (which refers to a poem) and he's received enough threats to only make him reexamine his life and try to do the right thing by getting to the bottom of it all with the help of his girl Friday, Velma, and a few friends.

Spillane was, as far as I know, a pulp writer. That might be true here with the noir-ish, layered mystery and the tough guy posturing, but this goes deeper than that. First are the characters. Velma is a doll. She has, as they say, bedroom eyes. She's dedicated to Mike and knows he'll never love her but would take a bullet for him nonetheless. But then there's a scene where she is practicing ballet. Where did THAT come from?! Now this is was made in 1955 but the side characters are an odd lot I wouldn't have expected to see in a movie like this. You have a Greek mechanic, an Italian opera singer, an African American club owner. Mike visits this owner's club (a jazz club) where he is obviously a regular. Nice touch. Then there's the story which revolves around something stolen (don't want to spoil) that must have been pretty heady at the time. So here's this pulp story containing multi-ethnic characters, ballet, opera, jazz and poetry. Go figure.

This is good stuff. The plot twists and turns. The authorities are corrupt. The bad guys are worse and Mike has self doubts about how he's been making a living. This digs deeper than I would have imagined. The production values are very good for that period. The music didn't get in the way so I guess it was good enough. The only thing things that bothered me were Ralph Meeker's voice (Mike Hammer should have a tougher, Bogart type voice) and the ending which was a bit over the top for me.

FYI, American prints from th 60's until restoration in the 2000's, had the alternate ending when Hammer and Velda don;t make it out of Ground Zero. What a Quantum Leap!! All the difference in the world. Criterion also includes a great booklet,also. Time for me to go. Fading fast! Spend the $ and get the Criterion edition. It's well worth it!!

897570,4,6304508549,"Robert Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY is a curiosity in every meaning of the word. From it's backwards-rolling opening credits to it's insane, much-referenced climax, this is NOT your average 1950s film noir. Ralph Meeker gives a sleek, vaguely creepy performance as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer whose life takes a dangerous turn after picking up a hitchhiking woman late one night (Cloris Leachman, in her first film role). What comes after is a film quite unlike anything else from the era, chock full of beautiful photography of Los Angeles, shots lifted time and again in future cinematic treasures (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, PULP FICTION) and lots and lots of paranoia and sexual innuendo. Good times, with a disc done oh-so-right by the crack team at Criterion.",1311984000,,761,5.0476190476190474
897571,4,6304508549,"Mike Hammer's not a nice guy.  He's a private detective who specializes in framing husbands by setting out his girlfriend and secretary to seduce them.  Sure, he's got a soft spot for beautiful women and for the Italian mechanic who fixes his cars.  That doesn't mean he won't risk their lives or sell them out for personal gain.

When he picks up a frantic woman on a dark night, and when he finds out later she's been killed for knowing too much, he pursues her killers, but not out of any desire for justice.  He sees an opportunity, and tries hard to make the most of it.  We get to follow along on the deadly ride.

Kiss Me Deadly is a delightfully dark film noir with a cold war angle that ends with a bang.  The original ending was cut upon its theatrical release, and both endings are restored here.  It's got all you want from a film noir, and goes dark enough that it manages to shock even now.  Criterion's done a great job with it and it looks better than ever.

897572,5,6304508549,"Arguably the finest film to be based on the writings of Mickey Spillane, director Robert Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY (1955) has just received a new, restored and remastered release from Criterion on DVD and Blu-ray.

L.A. ""bedroom dick,"" Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) picks up a blonde in a trenchcoat named Christina (Cloris Leachman) that he finds running barefoot down a lonely road in the middle of the night. Shortly thereafter, his car is run off into a ditch, and he and his hitchhiker are abducted. The girl is tortured to death by unseen assailants, and both her body and the unconscious Hammer are put in his car and pushed off a cliff. Hammer survives and soon finds himself embroiled in a search to find a mysterious and valuable box - ""the great whatsit"" - a prize which he hopes will pay off big. Unfortunately, the slick P.I. is in over his head, playing a game far bigger than he can imagine.

Director Aldrich and screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides made no secret of their dislike of Spillane's novel and the character of Mike Hammer, who they perceived as a stupid thug. So their story portrays Hammer exactly that way, and ignores the various virtues of the literary version. In the film, Hammer is a sleazy operator who uses his secretary Velda (Maxine Cooper) to entrap married men in sexual honey traps, enabling him to go to their wives with incriminating - and profitable - photos. Despite Christina being murdered while in his company, he doesn't pursue the case out of any noble effort to find justice for the girl; he just smells an opportunity to make a score. Like his literary counterpart, this Hammer is often violent, but unlike the Hammer of the books, he's portrayed as a cowardly sadist who only beats up on those weaker than himself.

The Mike Hammer of Spillane's novels is an occasionally brutal, rough-edged hero, while this film's version is almost the very definition of an antihero. The movie's Hammer is deftly summed up in one line: ""What's in it for me?""

Despite this deliberate misrepresentation of the character and the filmmakers' choice to almost completely discard the novel's plot, KISS ME DEADLY does portray the dark, twisted, Fifties noir universe of Spillane's novels better than any other film or TV adaptation of his work. Aldrich's direction is appropriately slick and stylized, and the cinematography of Ernest Lazlo perfectly captures the shadows and stark contrasts that visually represent the story's noir milieu.

The Criterion Blu-ray edition features a gorgeous, 1080p HD, 1.66:1 widescreen transfer that has undergone extensive digital restoration, removing virtually all evidence of print damage, dirt or wear. Contrast and detail are extraordinary, and far better than any previous home video release. I've owned this movie on VHS, laserdisc and DVD, and it has never looked this good before. Audio is in its original mono, but has been cleaned up, eliminating all pops and background hiss.

Supplemental features include an audio commentary by film historians Alain Silver and James Ursani, an odd video tribute to KISS ME DEADLY by REPO MAN director Alex Cox, excerpts from a 2005 documentary on screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides, a featurette on the locations used in the film, the alternate ending, and a slightly shortened version of the Max Allan Collins documentary, MIKE HAMMER'S MICKEY SPILLANE (originally part of the author/filmmaker's SHADES OF NOIR anthology film) covering the life and career of the legendary author. Finally, there's a 22-page booklet with extensive liner notes and articles about the film.

Ultimately, Aldrich & Bezzerides' KISS ME DEADLY tries to be an indictment of Spillane's work that also attempts to blatantly exploit the author's fame and popularity. The result is an ""anti-Spillane"" flick that somehow manages to depict his particular worldview better than any other. If you own any of the earlier editions of KISS ME DEADLY, the new Criterion version - though a bit pricey - is likely to be the definitive edition for the foreseeable future. It looks and sounds amazing, and is well worth trading up to. If you've never seen the film, and have any interest in 50s film noir, it is essential viewing.

Highly recommended.",1310688000,12,4215,5.02865329512894
897573,4,6304508549,"My first impressions watching this film were that it had too much of the technical quality of the TV show ""Dragnet"" - a stiff lead, stock and caricature immigrant male secondary players, static camera, procedural - but slowly it began to work it's dark and dirty magic on me. Mike Hammer is a piece of work without context or psychological background to pin him. As a viewer, you naturally identify with the lead actor and root for him to solve the mystery, but he's doing it by whoring out his secretary/love interest for information, roughing up people with sadistic pleasure and balking at cooperation with cops. He is not your typical 1950s movie archetype. ""Kiss Me Deadly"" has terrific sex bombs, particularly Gaby Rodgers, who reminded me of a young Diana Scarwid. She appeared in only one other film, which is unavailable. The procedural moves along its paces with only the easy women and rough and tough Hammer keeping it from completely falling asleep until we finally get to the heart of the matter, and then the film absolutely leaps to life and even more than 50 years later is gripping. The scene in the locker room is as good as sci-fi/paranoia filmmaking gets. Criterion Collection, which never does anything wrong, has produced a brilliant Blu-Ray reproduction of this black and white film. The extras, particularly the interview with filmmaker Alex Cox, are worthy additions. He discusses the classical allusions to Pandora's Box and helps you contextualize other aspects of the film in a short of maybe eight minutes. There is a big difference in feel between this and the classic film noir pictures that came before, particularly its inorganic nature, that Dragnet thing, which, for me, subtracts a star.

Ever since Criterion started releasing laserdiscs back in the day, they have gone way beyond what studios could ever offer. The quality of this classic on blu ray let's us know they are still going out of their way to restoring these old classics to prestine conditions. Seems the older the film, the better they get them to look. The detail in this hi-def release is amazing! I fell in love with this movie all over again after watching it on this version. Criterion still retains the original 1.66 aspect ratio (so expect small bands on the side of the image) and not blow up the image to the incorrect 1.78. Just amazed how great the black and white image can be on this older movie.

897576,5,6304508549,"KISS ME DEADLY (1955), director Robert Aldrich's coarse, violent (for its day) take on Mickey Spillane's best-selling Mike Hammer mystery novel, is now available in a sharp restored hi-def edition by The Criterion Collection.

Ralph Meeker is cast as the less than honorable private eye, who one night picks up a frightened Cloris Leachman on the highway.  It isn't more than a few minutes before they're hijacked.  She's killed, and he's put into his car and pushed off a cliff.

Naturally, Meeker survives, but now he's out to find Cloris' killers, and also learn the secret of the big ""whatsit,"" a crafty plot device that has inspired filmmakers, including Quentin Tarantino in PULP FICTION, for nearly fifty years.

The supporting cast includes Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Jack Elam, Juano Hernandez, Wesley Addy and Marion Carr, and much of the film was shot on/around Los Angeles' seedy, albeit picturesque, Bunker Hill area, which, sadly, has been totally renovated in recent years.

In addition to a brief alternate ending for the movie, this DVD release contains some excellent extras,  including a compelling featurette on Mickey Spillaine, as well as one on the movie's screenwriter,  A. I. Bezzerides, who did not like the original novel he'd been hired to adapt.  There are also featurettes on the history of Bunker Hill, a on-camera critique of the film by director Alex Cox and audio commentary by film noir specialists Alain Silver and James Ursini.

897627,4,6304508549,"United Artists presents ""KISS ME DEADLY"" (18 May 1955) (106 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Regarded by many critics as the ultimate film noir, and by many more as the finest movie adaptation of a book by Mickey Spillane, Kiss Me Deadly stars Ralph Meeker as Spillane's anti-social private eye Mike Hammer. While driving down a lonely road late one evening, Hammer picks up a beautiful blonde hitchhiker (Cloris Leachman), dressed in nothing but a raincoat. At first, Hammer assumes that the incoherent girl is an escaped lunatic; his mind is changed for him when he and the girl are abducted by two thugs. The men torture the girl to death as the semiconscious Hammer watches helplessly. He himself escapes extermination when the murderers' car topples off a cliff and he is thrown clear. Seeking vengeance, Hammer tries to discover the secret behind the girl's murder. Among those who cross his path in the film's tense, tingling 106 minutes are a slimy gangster (Paul Stewart), a turncoat scientist (Albert Dekker), and the dead woman's sexy roommate (Gaby Rodgers). All clues lead to a mysterious box -- the ""Great Whats it,"" as Hammer's secretary Velda (Maxine Cooper) describes it. Both the box and Velda are stolen by the villains, at which point Hammer discovers that the ""Whats it"" contains radioactive material of awesome powers. The apocalyptic climax is doubly devastating and we now know there are two endings to the film just recently discovered.

Ralph Meeker made an excellent contribution as Mike Hammer. He dominates the film with his presence. Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Mirian Carr, Maxine Cooper and especially Cloris Leachman, in her screen debut, make this film the favorite it has become.

Director Robert Aldrich transcends Kiss Me Deadly's basic genre trappings to produce a one-of-a-kind melodrama for the nuclear age.

897628,4,6304508549,"Sure I`m a film noir buff. And sure I like my film detectives that way as well, Sam Spade, Nick and Nora Charles, Phillip Marlowe and so on. Normally Mickey Spillane and his 1950s-style detective, Mike Hammer, would no hit my radar though. Believe me I did, however, spent many a misbegotten hour reading Spillane's detective stories, maybe as much for cover art work that ran to provocative bosomy, half-clothed femme fatale dames in distress as for the insipid story line that ran heavily to Mike's anti-communist warrior pose ready to smash heads at the drop of a hat, and grab an off-hand kiss from every dame he ran into along the way. Aside for the question of that scurrilous (now scurrilous, maybe) cover art that is better left for another day my tastes in detectives were more to the ""highbrow"" Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammet and their more knight-errant-worthy story lines, and a little more reserve in the fist department, although for a damsel in distress they were ready to duke it out with anyone, and gladly.

That said, now along comes this classic 1950s film noir Mike Hammer story line and I was hooked, well, maybe not hooked so much as intrigued by it. Moreover, director Richard Aldrich seems to have had a flair for the noir film, from those black and white filmed shots of streets scenes in the seamy Los Angeles be-bop night (and day too, come to think of it), to an incredible be-bop jazz bar scene, complete with ""torch"" singer where after the lost of a friend Mike gets plastered (drunk), to the endless line-up of high end ""golden age of the automobile"" cars on display. Of course there is the normal bevy (maybe two bevies, I didn't count) of alluring, mysterious women just waiting to fall into Mike's arms when he comes within fifty paces of them, and he is, as usual, ready to put on his white knight uniform when he senses that something in evil in the world, and he most definitely is willing to thumb his nose as the governmental authorities who are always just a step, or seven, behind the flow of the action. But most of that is all in a day's work for a noir detective. What makes this one stick out is the doom's day plot.

Of course, the 1950s was not only about the rise of the ""beats"" and of teen alienation and angst-driven rock and roll but the heart of the international Cold War, a scary time no question, where if things had taken a half-twist a different way. Well, who knows, but it was not going to be pretty. And part of that Cold War, a central part, was the presence of the ""bomb"", and for those who are too young to remember that was nothing but the atomic and hydrogen bombs that could, at any non-be-bop minute, blow the planet away.

And it is that threat that underlines old Mickey Spillane's tale. See, with that kind of threat, but also the power potential , private parties, evil private parties could think of all kinds of nasty ways to wreak havoc on the world. If only they could get just a little of that bomb power. And that lust, that seemingly eternal lust, for power by certain of our fellows is where we are heading. See, someone privy to the atomic secrets (no, not the heroic Rosenburgs, this guy was in it for the dough) had a little pot of the stuff ready for the highest bidder. And the highest bidder, so to speak, also happens to be a guy with plenty of dough to buy a ton of modern art (and a fondness for classic quotes). I knew there was something funny about those modern art collecting guys. Didn't you?

And all it takes to spoil that nefarious plan is one Mike Hammer. Now, and here is the beauty of the Spillane method, this is not for governmental agents to handle, as one would think in trusting 1950s America, although they are hot on the trail but one threadworn detective. Threadworn? Yes, threadworm. See Mike is nothing but a low-rent, dirt-peddling divorce work detective (in the days when such dirt was necessary to get that desperate divorce), working this racket with his girl Friday (and lure), Velda. But see maybe Mike just fell on hard times and needed some dough (although his car, office set-up, digs... and fetching Velda belie that). But once Mike gets on the case, and only when he knows in his gut that something is wrong and he has that feeling here, then they are no limits. He faces off the mob (naturally, if there is something evil to broker they are in on it), half-mad women (one that he picked up on the hitchhike road, kind of, and her roommate) and that relentless modern art collector before he is through. I could go on but, really, this is one you have to see. And add to your list of film noir be-bop nights.",1296172800,2,4635,4.475177304964539
897629,5,6304508549,"'Kiss me Deadly' may be the best film noir for a number of reasons. We are in the mid 50's at the height of the nuclear war scare, all the action takes place in L.A. before it was destroyed and completely changed, L.A. being a classic film noir site; the story based on a Mickey Spilane novel, and superb acting by everybody, especially by Ralf Meeker.

897630,4,6304508549,"With cheesy music cues, stationary camerawork, and conservative editing, ""Kiss Me Deadly "" is very much a budget movie of its time. With the exception of a few on location scenes in downtown Los Angeles, the mostly nocturnal action is usually confined to cramped interior apartment sets.  The nightmarish opening stands out as the most elaborate and stylized sequence, setting the strange and seedy tone of the movie nicely.  But while there is nothing atypical or overly impressive about the look of the rest of the movie the fun performances, unusually violent protagonist, and bizarre plot twists elevate this otherwise modest production. The script is dialogue heavy and the stylized banter is certainly a product of its times but it is also amusing and witty.

There are a few betrayals, kidnappings, and other noir clichs that spice up the plot, but ultimately its the weird apocalyptic elements introduced in the climatic final act that leave the biggest impression, especially  the original shocking ending. Unfortunately, the newly restored ending found on this DVD release lacks the same punch. The original ending is only a special feature. The action is spacious by modern standards but still in great abundance and fairly frequent, mostly leading man Ralph Meeker abusing would be assassins and informants with cringe inducing realistic smacks and punches, the sadistic glee on his face when engaging in said violence being an interesting and particularly unsettling detail.  Considering his complete lack of empathy for anyone around him, Mike Hammer would be thoroughly unlikable if he wasn't so naturally cool and bada$$. The rest of the movie is populated by rather horny dames and a huge memorable cast of weirdoes that are as strange looking as they are written.  The mystery that drives the movie really isn't that important, it's all just an excuse for Hammer to cruise around the city in his hip sports car and terrorize/manipulate anyone he thinks can help him crack the case.

897632,4,6304508549,"Offbeat noir that gets better with each viewing. Ralph Meeker, a sidelines character actor best known to the baby boomer gen for his frequent guest appearances in numerous  60's TV series and 70's TV movies, plays reknown fiction-author Mickey Spillane's  trademark ""Mike Hammer""  private investigator [PI] character. Remember when the Western met the living dead in the form of vampires [CURSE OF THE UNDEAD, 1959]?  Well now another odd combo as it's film noir meets the atomic age. This noir is different. The opening credits roll in reverse, driving scenes are filmed from behind, and the bad guys doing their dirty work are often filmed  below the knees [or not at all] with only gait, voice and the viewer's imagination creating the picture. And the two female leads have much shorter hair than we're used to seeing in noir.

Vet character actress Cloris Leachman, who we are all familiar with from her numerous 70's TV movies, her role as Phylis in the Mary Tyler Moore show [1970-77] and a couple of noteable Mel Brooks' comedies  [YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, 1974, and HIGH ANXIETY, 1977] is the first person we see in this film, playing a mysterious figure named Christina.  We all remember her chiseled facial features---hawk-like  nose and sickle-like  lips---but here, younger and with the short, blond, croppy hair and raincoat-only attire, appears surprisingly attractive. She hails Meeker's sports car on a desolate highway one lonely night and asks for a lift. Inside she tells her story of escape. The two are followed and kidnapped by persons unknown who incapacitate Hammer and torture her. The unconscious duo are then brutally driven off a cliff to their certain demise with only Hammer surviving. Now it's time for Hammer to dust himself off and figure out this bizarre encounter.

Before being intercepted Christina gives Hammer a verbal  message containing two words.  A letter she mailed at a gas station before her death is received by Hammer days later and contains the same two words. Hammer knows that no one is gonna kidnap you, torture you, then drive you off a cliff because you stepped on their daisies. Somebody's after something---and it's  not a bag of shells.

What carries you through this film is Meeker and his monotonous yet always-thinking, simmering and unpredictable persona. Despite his sordid nature he manages to keep us interested in his welfare---we don't want that nice hair to get mussed up.  Meeker's only other noteworthy movie roles was playing the dishonorable soldier who annoyingly shadows Jimmy Stewart in the Western classic, THE NAKED SPUR [1953], playing the groveling, condemned soldier  in Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY [1957] and as the military psychiatrist in THE DIRTY DOZEN [1967]---remember his report informing Lee Marvin that he had a group of both imbeciles and psychopaths on his hands. He's focused and in-the-zone in this one, easily his career-best performance. He's always nattily attired and the hair perfectly groomed despite his escapades. Kind of reminds me of that kid we all had in high school who was different---with the neat, pressed clothes, and the neat, shiny hair, and always bringing the brown paper bag with lunch from home instead of gagging on the lousy cafeteria food. And the gals would often be on his periphery. This pampered and pompous kid was quite a source of annoyance to the rest of us ""normal"" dudes in class as was Meeker to the police lieutenant, also searching for the truth, on his tail. Meeker was able to decipher Christina's message because among one of many admirable traits of this austere, aloof but likeable PI, was an ability to look and listen carefully and remember details.  Hey, generation X could learn a lot from this guy.

Interestly, the only person in the film to bring a child-like grin to his stoic face is his auto mechanic friend Nick who is probably the only person he genuinely likes. His ""secretary"" Velda is obviously the person he trusts the most. When Nick is mysteriously murdered in his auto shop and Velda is kidnapped  he goes on a septuagenarian slapping spree. Love the way Meeker gets things done---and procures the info he needs---with alacrity and economy: a slap across the chops here, a desk drawer vising some fingers there, lauding then breaking a priceless record, stopping a nocturnal predator with a box of popcorn. Wish he carried a gun, though.

Another  memorable  performance is provided by Christina's roommate Gabriella, played a by little-known actress named Gaby Rodgers.  She reminds one of an older, middle-aged, trail-beaten  Anne Heche. Rodgers' not-soon-forgotten oddball , missing-a-marble performance as Christina's  androgynous, missing roommate is great. Her on-and-off plaintive and whimsical demeanor and child-like voice with the staccato-like delivery were engaging---and deceiving too---as they  did not  portend her eventual  psychopathic meltdown [figuratively and literally]. Her performance soon brought to mind two other similarly flavored performances: Melanie Griffith [THE DROWNING POOL, 1975] and Jennifer Tilley [BOUND,  1996].  Fine work by Director Aldrich with his insightful  pick for a singular and probably influential  femme fatale  characterization. Hard to believe the talented  Rodgers never made it after this.

Nice seeing veteran actor Albert Dekker whose last film was THE WILD BUNCH [1969]. Always loved his deliberate and mysterious voice which allowed him to play exotic, erudite characters  so well  [you've got to see him in Dr Cyclops, 1940]. Here he played the mastermind of the obscure and nefarious  group. The ending is morose and open-ended. The film seemed to prey on the 50's fear of Cold War nuclear posturing.

A rather gritty movie considering it came out in the mid-50's. If you love nostalgia and are familiar with the LA area, you'll love the scenes shot on location.
  What's always a good quality in any movie is a story you can follow, which you have here. It's the typical noir where a lot of smoking & drinking goes on, yet everyone's dressed up.
  In short, a PI picks up a hitchhiker (Cloris Leechman!) that escaped from an insane asylum. She knows information that everyone's trying to find out. It's all about a box in a gym locker.
  I found it especially interesting, recognizing a lot of the supporting cast (I watched a lot as a kid on Saturdays with dad). I also have a huge interest in Los Angeles past, so seeing the trolly car going up the hill, hotels downtown not there anymore, etc etc, was a big treat.

It may seem odd to criticize a film for being sordid when that's almost certainly the feel it was going for, but Kiss Me Deadly's incredible misanthropy and misogynism just kinda made me want to take a shower; also hampered by the fact that the central character of Mike Hammer never manages to be very interesting, Kiss Me Deadly is ultimately worth watching more for its influence on later films (e.g. Pulp Fiction, Raiders of the Lost Ark) than for its actual worth as a movie.

897707,5,6304508549,"Some 50+ years later, this blistering film noir remains wonderfully subversive & disturbingly prescient. Its unflinchingly bleak & sardonic vision of an ostensibly civilized world sliding headfirst into gleeful barbarism rings even more true today, when anti-intellectualism & brute force are celebrated in public & political life. No wonder discerning French critics lauded it!

Ralph Meeker is perfect as Mike Hammer, the best excuse for a hero his world can muster -- a misogynistic, self-serving thug who relishes any opportunity to intimidate & humiliate others, all in the name of a fast & sleazy buck. (Although he clearly enjoys beating up others even if there isn't any cash in sight.) Anyone with the slightest inclination towards culture & basic human decency is doomed in this world. Hammer has no use for ambiguity, complexity, or depth. ""Force is all they understand"" -- and all he wants to understand.

There's an inexorable ferocity & drive to this film, as unlucky bystanders drop like flies & Hammer draws closer to the conclusion of his case. But unlike the traditional hero, the deeper he goes into the mystery he's struggling to unravel, the worse he makes things. And in the end, as the deadly Maguffin winds up in the very creepy hands of the vacuous but vicious Lily, we see that the proudly ignorant will not only inherit the earth, they'll probably destroy it, too.

Mickey Spillane fans won't be happy with this film -- Spillane himself hated it -- but director Robert Aldrich has crafted a brilliant & savage parable for our times, one that seems all too accurate with each passing day. Highly recommended!",1244160000,,1634,5.0

The thrills come from the ahead-of-it's-time violence -- some of the most sadistic of which is handed out by Hammer.  The picture also takes the cynisism of 50s noir and extends that to the political climate with it's much vaunted apocalyptic ending.  This seems to lay the groundwork for 70s thrillers like Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor with their paranoia and suspicion.

He's not really bad, but certainly isn't good, either: he just is. He's not entirely stupid, but you couldn't call him clever. He doesn't survive because he's smart: he just survives. Also, he doesn't really know what he's doing, he merely figures that he's on to something big, and wants to hunt it down. When given a truth drug, it doesn't work, because he doesn't know anything, and isn't interested in truth anyway. There's something new, but familiar about this individual. It's as though he were the id beneath the id. A sort of fundamental impulse underlying all life, enabling it to function, regardless. Totally unsentimental, only generous if it doesn't cost him anything except a few greenbacks, motivated by revenge sometimes, in a limited sort of way. The story, such as it is, is vividly shot. Any acting is based more on the simple physical appearance of the assorted thugs and molls.

The film credits roll in a reverse direction, as if to symbolize this movie. The film opens on a highway at night, a woman is running down the road looking for help. A sports car stops to pick her up, she is crying. A police patrol is looking for a woman who escaped from an asylum! Mike Hammer tells them the woman is his wife. Later a big black sedan cuts them off and captures them. Christina is tortured to death (off screen), then she and Hammer are put in his car which is pushed off the cliff. When Hammer recovers he is questioned by the ""I.C.C."" about what happened. Hammer is a PI who specialized in divorce actions with his beautiful secretary Velda. Upon his return to his office we see a 1950's telephone answering machine. Then Hammer goes to meet a client. He learned the name and address of Christina's roommate. (We hear a trolley in the street.)

Someone sent a gift car for Hammer. He looks it in the mouth and removes the extra features. Hammer then learns about some new people, and finds out more. He visits a rich man who tells him to drop the investigation. But trouble is his business, and he continues to look for something. Christina's friend Lily is afraid, and asks Mike to hide her. Then Mike's friend Nick is murdered. Velda talks about how some people are always searching for the ""great whatsit""! Mike visits a bar to drown his sorrows. A message told him that Velda was abducted. At the office Mike is abducted and taken for a ride. They give him sodium pentothal to get him to talk. But Mike escapes from this trap. Later Mike finds a key and figures out where it belongs, and finds a very hot secret.

Ralph Meeker playing narcissistic, unscrupulous private investigator and Spillane anti-hero Mike Hammer becomes involved in a plot that is beyond his normal scope.  Hammer who generates most of his business through divorce inquests, uses both the charms of his sexy assistant Velda played by Maxine Cooper and his own to embellish his cases.

Hammer is tooling along a deserted highway in his signature sports car when he almost runs over a young Cloris Leachman clad only in a trenchcoat and little else.  He stops to pick her up and soon learns that she's escaped from an asylum.  Driving together they are forced off the road and abducted by a gang lead by a faceless heavy recognizable only by a pair of fancy shoes.  Leachman who reveals some mysterious secrets to Hammer in previous conversation, is tortured to death.  She's then placed along with Hammer in his car and they are pushed off a cliff.

Hammer survives the ordeal but gets the idea that he's stumbled into a scheme that has potential for immense financial rewards.  Using his investigative talents and utilizing an array of associates such as auto mechanic Nick, played by Nick Dennis and Cooper,  Hammer comes into contact with a wide variety of sketchy villains including Leachman roommate Lily played by Gaby Rodgers.

We finally learn that the prize that the bad guys are after is contained within a well insulated black case and apparently contains some radioactive material.  The tastefully shoed head of the gang is revealed to be Albert Dekker playing the arcane Dr. Soberin who is in cohoots with Gaby Rodgers.

897763,4,6304508549,"This review is for the 2001 MGM DVD.

Kiss Me Deadly is a film based on Mickey's Spillane's book featuring his fictional private detective Mike Hammer.  The basic storyline involves a naked woman (Cloris Leachman) in a trench coat that Hammer (Ralph Meeker) finds on a deserted highway.  He later finds out she escaped from a mental institution and soon after the two are attacked by some unidentified men and the woman is killed and Hammer barely survives with his life.  The rest of the movie focuses on Hammer finding out why these men killed this woman.

I found the movie easy to watch and entertaining even though there were some obvious flaws in the plot and the production.  It's clearly a movie from an era gone by: a man's movie from the ""old school"" of tough guy films where the lead character has all the women he encounters melting in his arms, he can be ruthlessly  tough as nails, and is streetwise and smart without seeming too cerebral.  He drives the coolest cars (a Jaguar and a Corvette) and lives in an impressive bachelor pad.  (I never knew there were telephone answering machines in the mid-1950's.)  The movie was filmed in Los Angeles in 1955 and has some nice shots of the undeveloped Pacific coastline plus scenes from the old Hill Street neighborhood.  Overall I liked the look and nostalgic feel of the movie, even though the plot is mediocre at best.

The DVD picture quality is overall near pristine.  Once in a while in a tiny spot of film wear could be observed, but it was never a distraction to the movie.  The only DVD bonuses are the trailer and the ending that was originally released with the film.  The final scene shown at the end of the feature presentation shows what the director originally intended, but apparently due to a glitch in the editing at the studio, a different ending was used in the original theater release.  In my opinion, the director's ending is better and it's terrific that it was preserved and used for the ending of the feature movie on the DVD.

897766,4,6304508549,"""Kiss Me Deadly"" is based on the novel of the same name by Mickey Spillane and features his private detective Mike Hammer, who is more a con artist than an investigator. Mike (Ralph Meeker) picks up a panicked woman on the road at night, only to be run off the road by her faceless pursuers shortly thereafter. When Hammer regains consciousness, the woman is dead, he is laid up in the hospital, and federal investigators are asking questions. Contemptuous of the law, Mike stonewalls the authorities. But he decides to stray from his usual fare -making sure he profits from both sides in divorce cases- and investigate the case himself. With the assistance of his loyal secretary Velda (Maxine Cooper) Mike sets out to find out who the dead woman was, who she was running from, and why she was killed.

Mike Hammer is not an appealing or sympathetic character. He doesn't investigate out of any sense of justice for the woman who met a horrible death, or even out of vengeance for his own treatment. He simply thinks he must be onto some valuable blackmail material. Ralph Meeker does a superb job with this role. But ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is a film without likable characters and, in fact, without interesting characters either. This is a film noir that came late in the classic noir cycle: 1955. Unlike the noirs of the 1940s, which were thematically concerned with the 1930s, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" has a very post-war feel: the cutting edge technology of Mike's reel-to-reel answering machine, Cold War intrigue, crinolined skirts and prominent bustlines. ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is thoroughly entrenched in the 1950s. Prominent film noir theorists have declared it one of the greats, but it's so unlike the films of the 1940s that it doesn't have the same appeal. The femmes fatales are bimbos with petty ambitions, not smart, articulate women. Mike Hammer is misogynistic, self-important, and completely lacking in introspection. He's not angsty or doomed, as noir men frequently are. But an extroverted protagonist doesn't interest me, because there is no more to him than meets the eye. To me, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is a sleek, well-directed, detective story that goes through the motions, but simply has no depth. It's entertaining as such, but it's as superficial as its characters. Many film noir fans will disagree with me, so you'll have to judge for yourself.

The DVD: There is a theatrical trailer (2 minutes) and an alternate ending (1 minute). The alternate ending is shorter than the one in the movie and was actually the more common ending for the film. There is no difference in meaning between the two endings. The shorter one just uses less footage and isn't quite as good.

897872,5,6304508549,"Having seen the film several times now, I decided to venture into the novel on which it is based. Aside from a few name changes, the plot is essentially the same, though some details and sequences of events are altered. In the novel, the 'Mafia' is mentioned as the sinister force behind the abductions and murders that frame the plot, but in the film the 'M' word is never even mentioned! Also, in the novel, the setting is New York City, whereas in the film it is (conveniently for Hollywood) Los Angeles. Mike Hammer in the novel is a brusque, hard-hitting private dick who takes out his enemies with his bare hands. Several passages in which he bare-handedly dispatches the thugs trying to do him in are conspicuously absent from the film. In one episode he pulls the eyeballs out of his opponent's head! The film's version of Hammer is decidedly meeker, though tough enough and callous enough to carry the plot. Ralph Meeker plays Hammer not so much as a tough guy seeking justice, but rather as a hedonist who happens to be caught up in 'Something Big'. In the film, the solution to the riddle of the 'Whatsit' is more of an item of curiosity than of righteousness or vengeance. In the novel, too, the nature of the 'Whatsit' is revealed fairly early on, in contrast to the film, where the nature of the mysterious package is kept concealed until almost the end.

The changes in the film, though technically minor, affect the whole tone of the work. The novel is darker, with many more episodes taking place on rainy days, or at night, in dark alleys and bars.

  Robert Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY brings Mickey Spillane's pulp hero to life in all his amoral glory.  Ralph Meeker plays the private eye whose specialty is divorce cases.  Meeker's Hammer is a character who'd transcended cynicism before he crawled out of the crib.  Hammer is a modern man (circa 1955) and the brooding, blasted and failed Romanticism of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe isn't for him.  Hammer has no preconceptions to shatter.  His curiosity in things end after he learns ""what's in it for him.""

  Unfortunately, as drawn in this movie, Hammer has almost no dialogue.  We have to learn about him through his actions, and about the only time we see animated humanity behind his grinning eyes is when he's smashing someone's fingers in a desk drawer.  On second thought, maybe we don't want to learn that much about him after all.  He's got a hep bachelor pad though, with a real swinging answering machine.  Hef would have been proud.

  KISS ME DEADLY is long on style and dreadfully short on substance.  The closer you look at the plot the flimsier it becomes.  I wonder if that was the point, though.  It seems to be, with its stylized violence and penchant for clothing its actresses in nothing but terrycloth robes, that KISS ME DEADLY was trying to push the envelope a bit, jump the Code and stake out unclaimed territory.  If so, it probably worked in ways a modern audience is too jaded to recognize.  Even so, there is a violent scene or two that made me squirm.  Not for every taste, but an intriguing character study of an inaccessible character.

897874,1,6304508549,"Before people start throwing accusations around, I want to make it clear that I am a HUGE film noir fan!  I don't reject this film because it's hard for me to enjoy the classics, but just the opposite; classic films are the only films I DO enjoy, therefor it irks me when this film gets mentioned among the ranks of such awesome noir films as ""White Heat"", ""Double Indemnity"", and ""The Killing"".  Hey, even the old gangster greats that aren't even mentioned anymore like ""D.O.A."", ""Cry Danger"" and ""Pickup on South Street"" are much better than this stinker in my opinion.  I don't know how Robert Aldrich (one of my favorite directors) could have ever gotten involved with this hack project.  But most of all, I wish people would stop calling ""Kiss Me Deadly"" a film noir.  True, it does meet some of the criteria for inclusion within the genre, but what it has in dark, pervasive gloom and thoroughly gritty atmosphere (which, admittedly, it possesses in spades), it lacks in many other trademarks of film noir.  The story is basically a good one, but it drags a LOT, and with no great background music, interesting cinematography, or gripping dialogue, it offers up about as much suspense as a trip to the laundromat.  And if that wasn't enough to ruin the film for me (which, I assure you, it was), the acting is atrocious!!!  Ralph Meeker just couldn't cut the mustard here.  He is flat, detatched from his character, and has absolutely no stage presence.  It is possible that Meeker couldn't pull this off because he had to play a sadistic, womanizing dirtbag, which is more difficult for actors than playing a good guy, but if you're going to have a sleazy lead character (VERY bad idea for a film, even a NOIR film, in the first place, as an audience wants SOMEONE to root for), at least cast someone who can PLAY a sleazy, unsympathetic type character.  Do you know who would have been 100 times better in this role???  Richard Widmark!!!  Even when he's playing law enforcement characters or upstanding citizens, there's something sinester about his presence.  And unlike Ralph Meeker, Richard Widmark can ACT and therefor, would have been the ULTIMATE Mike Hammer for film.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say that Richard Widmark could have been to Mike Hammer what Dick Powell was to Phillip Marlowe and what Humphrey Bogart was to Sam Spade.  I consider it a lost opportunity, especially since it would have boosted the career of one of the most underrated actors of the twentieth century.  The characters are cardboard and unrealistic, the situations are pure fantasy, and the whole premise is just an excuse to see some knuckle-dragging idiot beating people up, scoring with chicks, and using fancy gadgets to fight crime.  I guess this is when the true film P.I.'s, who had to use deduction, perception, and intuition to solve cases, gave way to the techno-age pseudo-sleuths of the sixties and so on, like James Bond and the like.

Spillane's Mike Hammer is a New York detective-avenger, a self-righteous vigilante who deals out justice when the paralyzed forces of the law can do nothing: he's a vicious knight on a mean-spirited quest to right wrongs through brute force. (The title of the first Hammer novel, ""I, the Jury"" pretty much sums up his attitude.) The movie relocates Hammer to Los Angeles and turns him into a shallow con-artist who only cares about his car and his looks. He's a lousy detective too, relying on knocking people around for information, often innocent inoffensive folks, and never really paying attention to the important details of the case. His detective work is entirely matrimonial, where he and his `assistant' Velda put the squeeze on couples to blackmail them. Hammer's motto is simple: ""What's in it for me?"" Ralph Meeker is perfect in the role, looking as if someone carved him out of slab of meat.
No doubt, in this story Hammer is in way over his head...if only he knew it. He picks up a nearly naked girl (Cloris Leachman in an early role) who throws herself in front of his sports car. Later, they're run off the road, and faceless gangsters torture her to dearth and leave Hammer for dead. Hammer sets out to find out what's up; not because he cares what happened to the girl, but because he sniffs out big money and he'd like to get the guys who wrecked his sports car! Hammer finds himself in a violent quest to locate an object that everyone desires: a package called `The Great Whatsit.' The Great Whatsit isn't a meaningless red herring or Hitchcock McGuffin, however. Its contents are the great surprise of the plot, and the perfect exclamation point on a movie taking place in a chaotic world that seems to be falling apart. I won't tell what the Great Whatsit is (and shame on the reviewers here who have!), but...oh wow!
And this brings us to the issue of the ending, and the only extra on this disc. (Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending.) For years, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" had a mysteriously abrupt finale that many people praised for its surreal, weird quality. This was how I first saw it. However, in 1997 the original ending was discovered in Aldrich's personal print of the film by editor Glenn Erickson and film noir scholar Alain Silver. Apparently, an accident involving a careless projectionist snipped off part of the ending, so what we had enjoyed and critiqued for years was actually a mistake! The new ending shown on this disc fortunately doesn't change the tone of the film: it's still pretty astonishing, filled with a brilliant use of light and sound effects. However, there's still something about that abrupt ending that gets to people. The DVD contains the option to watch this original abrupt ending so you can make up your mind which one `feels' more right to you: what the director intended, or the mistake that many embraced as a stroke of brilliance.
No matter which ending you like, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is a fabulous piece of brutal crime cinema. The photography is amazing, filled with weird and surreal images and crazy camera angles. The performances are all dead-on: Meeker's ugly Mike Hammer; Albert Dekker as the sinister and poetry spouting Dr. Soberin; Wesley Addy as Hammer's police acquaintance Pat, the sole voice of reason in the mess; Paul Stewart as a smarmy L.A. gangster; the late Jack Elam as freaky thug; and Gaby Rodgers in the film's strangest performance as the distant, weird, but ultimately very dangerous (to every living thing on the planet!) Lily Carver.
If you love detective films and film noir, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is a great must-see classic. For a 1950s film, it is surprisingly violent and far ahead of its time. And either end will leave you shivering in shock. If only they had the guts to end films this way today!",1079654400,165,4415,4.765013054830288
897878,5,6304508549,"Condemned by censors, panned by critics, and banned by the Btritish when it was released in 1955 KISS ME DEADLY is today universally considered one of the definitive and perhaps most perfectly realized films noirs ever made. Director Robert Aldrich and screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides, both having a mutual contempt for right wing pulp novelist Mickey Spillane and all he stood for, nevertheless smartly capitalized on the extraordinary success of the author at the time, basing their film on Spillane's book of the same name while taking such drastic liberties with his story, characters, and ideologies that the finished product would be nearly unrecognizable to serious Spillane fans. This point seems to be forshadowed, as film noir scholar James Naremore has pointed out, in the weirdly reversed opening credits which seem to stand Mickey Spillane on his head.
The movie opens with divorce detective Mike Hammer(Ralph Meeker) forced to pick up a barefoot and naked-under-a-trenchcoat Christina Baily(Chloris Leachman in her first screen role)who, as we soon find out, has escaped from a mental institution and is running down the middle of a remote California road at night. When Hammer is quickly run off the road by gangsters who torture Christina to death and nearly kill Hammer himself his interest is sparked. Hammer smells something big and the cut of something big is...well, big. He decides to give the divorce work a rest and devote himself, his adoring secretary Velda(Maxine Cooper), his Greek mechanic friend Nick(Nick Dennis), and anyone else he can get to do his dirty work for him to this new mystery. The film is rich with Cold War fear and nuclear paranoia as all the characters relentless focus of selfish greed is on ""the great whatsit"", the mysterious glowing box of material stolen from a nuclear testing facility. Mike Hammer's detective is totally enjoyable to watch although a distinctly unfavorable and immoral character. He whores out his secretary, Velda, without remorse to adulterous husbands to wrap up divorce cases, gets his innocent friend Nick killed by involving him in the case, is a markedly poor detective, and sadistically enjoys physically punishing those who get in his way.
KISS ME DEADLY is fundamentally wrapped up in the definitions of the film noir genre, containing all the elements--a stark opening sequence on a dark road, destructive manipulating femme fatales, low-life cheap gangsters, dark expressionistically lit night-time scenes, a vengeful (or greedy?) quest, maybe the best, and most anti-, anti-hero of the noir canon, and a dark mood of hopelessness.",1052611200,14,2612,5.251196172248804
897879,4,6304508549,"Dark and moody and violent, more style than substance -- and enough more to make it all right (as Humphrey Bogart said in another movie in this genre).  Credited with inspiring the entire French New Wave cinema movement of the late 1950s.  (In one scene that would have sent those French directors, Ralph Meeker walks a deserted but lamp-lit city street late at night, trailed by a would-be assassin.  Their footsteps echo in the stark landscape; their shadows are about a mile long.)  Reportedly, French critical writing found deep symbolism in various scenes, whereas director Robert Aldrich responded that this was news to him, they were just shooting a detective picture.  True to the spirit of the Mike Hammer novels, there is a pervasive vagueness.  Who are all these thugs?  (We don't even see their faces at first.)  What are they after?  (A nasty little radioactive Pandora's Box, we eventually learn; it is very well staged but little explained, and is ultimately a fool's prize.)  Well-cast Meeker portrays unredeemed sleazy private eye Mike Hammer, whose normal line is blackmailing married men with the help of his girlfriend Velda (he carries a .45, Velda a .32).  The menacing thugs, wearing baggy clothes and fedoras, we might take for NKVD (as indeed they are, in other of the Mickey Spillane novels circa 1950, and also near the end in the 1994 film _Burnt by the Sun_), but sufficient unto this film is the evil thereof, without contribution from Stalin, Beria & Co.",1045526400,5,1485,4.9

897940,5,6304508549,"Most unaccountably, ""Kiss Me deadly"" has been long underated or neglected, like its director Robert Aldrich, whose best is probably ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.""  Though ""Kiss Me Deadly"" does not feature the incredibly campy battle between Bette and Joan, it still gives us a dynamite opening where a frantic girl is desperately running, with her foot naked, on the deserted highway at midnight.  She needs a help, she says to detective Mike Hammer, who happened to be driving there.  This is the start of another long day for this LA private eye.
Then follow some deaths, and threats from government agents and secret organization alike.  Hammer's investigation is, as is the case with the genre, full of plot twists, but Aldrich never gets us bored with his rather laid-back direction and occassional shock materials provided for the fans.  The violence (such as torture) is all suggested, not directly depicted, but the power is still there after half a century.  The dialugues or situatons are all intentionally clunky, as if Aldrich is telling that the events are all happening on another planet.  But his tactics work, giving the entire picture some strange feelings like another world.
We must remember that the film is made soon after the WW2, and the world is haunted with the images of nuclear age, and the conflicts between two superpowers.  Clearly the weird touch of the film reinforces the uneasiness of these times found in the film, and the fears of the days are conveyed to us even now.  So, nothing is fully explained; everything is suggested.  You find a box, but you don't know what it is (but can guess).  And the ""shock"" ending has not lost its power yet.
Actors are comparatively unknown except the prolific Cloris Leachman (later wins Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show""), but that doesnot matter.  Just watch it, and enjoy its stylish camerawor, and shocks that its audiences saw years ago.  And find the possible inspiration for the ""box"" which Jules and Vincent had in a coffee shop in ""Pulp Fiction.""",1042934400,5,2051,4.876080691642652
897941,5,6304508549,"This intense story starts off fast and continues at a breakneck pace until its ""didn't-see-that-coming"" conclusion. The ending is very atypical of the film noir genre (hence the title of my review), but everything leading up to it is noir at its finest. Ralph Meeker's portrayal of Mike Hammer is nothing short of sensational. He's the kind of guy you love to hate for how he conducts his business, but secretly wish you were half as cool. Some have noted his character as ""bumbling"", but I found him to be quite the opposite; he was able to handle just about any situation with either brute force or sly cleverness (ok, maybe he didn't do some follow-up work on Christina Bailey's roomate Lily Carver, which cost him, but I think we can overlook that). He's at his best when he's smacking someone around, which he does throughout. You couldn't have asked for a better performance.
I thought the development of the secondary characters was done quite well, e.g. even though Nick the mechanic didn't have much screen time, how bad did you feel for him when he met with his fate? And Doc Kennedy who performed Christina Bailey's autopsy. You could tell after 30 seconds that this guy was scum. I also enjoyed the two brutes Sugar and Charlie Max. Those guys had some of the best facial expressions ever filmed.
All this aside, my favorite aspect of the film was the cinematography. Filmed in glorious black & white so rich you'd think you were watching it unfold live in front of you. Also included are some of the best camera angles from the genre. One scene that sticks out is when Hammer tells Carver to meet him outside once she hears him honk the horn. They show Hammer running down the stairs from the vantage point of the top of the stairs. When Carver makes the same trip down they lensed it from the bottom. Really made an impact with me.
You should enjoy this movie if you have any interest in either noir or older b&w movies.",1037232000,2,1934,4.560344827586207
897942,5,6304508549,"Hands down one of the best detective thrillers there is. Ralph Meeker is the ideal Mike Hammer in this down and dirty crime film. Robert Aldrich directs this at a breathless pace and with ahead of it's time style. Cloris Leachman is featured in an early role at the beginning and you don't forget her for the rest of the film. Her death by torture and her screams haunt the film (and Hammer) and you want her death avenged as much as Hammer does. His secretary, Velda, is a toothy sex-pot with the hots for him so bad you can taste it. She'll literally do ANYTHING for him. Bad girl Lily is a real psycho babe and is willing to bring the world to an end out of greedy curiosity. Her comeuppance is a vivid highlight of the climax. Women like this just weren't on the screen at the time. Only in pulp novels. But Aldrich brings them deliciously to life as motivations for Hammer to plow his way through a truly wild murder mystery and search for a ""great what's-it"" in pure 50's pulp style. Two endings are available on DVD but I can't see that much difference---but maybe there is. This is slick, violent adult viewing all the way. WAY out there for the time. It's classy stylish trash if there is such a thing but undeniably entertaining and superbly made. Even if you aren't a Spillane fan, you'll enjoy this. It's a great one-of-a-kind movie.",1033948800,5,1345,4.42741935483871
897943,5,6304508549,"OK, I mention quirks, so let me get right to them.  One involves the way the bad guy gets it in the end, so I can't say anything about it without giving away a major plot element.  But it is perhaps the oddest way any character has died since a character in Charles Dickens's BLEAK HOUSE died of spontaneous combustion.  Just watch the movie; you'll see what I am talking about.  The other endearing quirk is some of the ""hot"" technology you find in it.  Without any question, this film features the first answering machine in the history of cinema.  A full two decades before the breakout of the answering machine in American life, there is a reel-to-reel tape machine answering machine in Mike Hammer's apartment.
Despite a hokey ending, this is a really cool film.  Ralph Meeker never had the kind of career he should have had.  He was charismatic, a good looking guy, and a talented actor, but had only a few roles that were plum parts.  In particular, he had a very fine role as a rogue ex-calvary officer in Anthony Mann's THE NAKED SPUR, and he had a great part in Stanley Kubrick's anti-war classic PATHS OF GLORY.  All things considered, his finest role was, however, playing Mike Hammer in this film.
The film has great atmosphere, a fine story (until the bizarre end), and fine acting.  Stylistically, it is film noirish with a hipper edge.  Mike Hammer may be a detective, but he likes to have fun as well.  Philip Marlowe in Raymond Chandler's novels always has a sense of the tragic element of life as well as its absurdity.  His stance towards many of the events of his books is ironic.  There is no sense of irony with Mike Hammer.  He has a chip on his should just for the heck of it.  He may lack Philip Marlowe's depth and complexity, but he probably gets more enjoyment out of life.  He probably would also make a better dinner guest.
There is a great period feel to the film.  It was made and set in the mid-1950s, but rarely have I seen a film that gives such a great sense of when it was made.  It also features a great case.  In particular, it is amazing to see Cloris Leachman play a part when she was young and very cute.
I thoroughly recommend this movie.  It has a lot of energy, a lot of style, and tells a great yarn.  And even though the ending is scientifically iffy, it is still a lot of fun.",1024617600,3,2325,4.355813953488372
897944,5,6304508549,"""Kiss Me Deadly"" has been accurately termed a ""long neglected classic.""  The good news is that the 1955 release directed by Robert Aldrich has been recently receiving the recognition it deserves.  The bad news was that it came too late to help Ralph Meeker, who did a superb job of playing Mickey Spillane's detective Mike Hammer in the film.  Meeker, who replaced Marlon Brando on Broadway in ""Streetcar Named Desire"" and later starred in ""Picnic,"" could have profited had the film been a contemporary success in the way that Sean Connery did in his association with James Bond, which propelled him to international stardom.  Meeker failed to get a break when Harry Cohn at Columbia signed the more bankable William Holden to play the male lead in the film version of ""Picnic,"" which proved to be a soaring vehicle for newcomer Kim Novak.
Robert Aldrich presented his subject matter and the script by Hollywood veteran A.J. Bezzerides in the same hard-hitting manner he embraced in his other major hit from 1955, the highly acclaimed ""The Big Knife,"" Clifford Odets' cynical view of Hollywood starring Jack Palance and Shelley Winters.
The film begins with Meeker as Hammer picking up Cloris Leachman on a lonely road.  This was her film debut.  He learns that she has escaped from a mental facility and is seeking a ride to Los Angeles.  Instead Hammer is waylaid by gangsters, who kill Leachman and almost succeed in destroying the detective.  Hammer's toughness pays off when he survives a three day hospital ordeal hovering on the brink of death after his sports car is pushed off the highway with himself and the already dead Leachman in it.
When Meeker is later questioned by federal authorities he realizes that this was not the death of some poor, confused soul by some angry gangsters, but something of much greater importance.  They excoriate Meeker for the way he makes a living.  While the detective seduces married women, his sexy secretary Velda, played by Maxine Cooper, compromises married men.  As a result they are able to build up a thriving divorce business through their nefarious activities as vehicles of temptation.  When Meeker-Hammer is dismissed by the federal officers, the chief investigator says sarcastically, ""Open the window and let in some fresh air.""
A moralist could argue that Hammer is ultimately punished for his tawdry ways since Velda is kidnapped by gangsters, who warn the detective to lay off.  Instead his resolve increases to solve the case and get back his secretary unscathed.  His efforts lead him into the nether world of cheap criminal activity in the Bunker Hill section near Los Angeles.  Great photography reveals this shadowy world in the darkness of hallways and small rooms.  On one occasion, to gain quick attention and obtain information, he coolly destroys an expensive collector's item record featuring Enrico Caruso.  Hammer continues encountering tawdry figures in bedraggled settings playing beautiful classical music, contrasting the difference between a world of beauty and the nether world of tawdry brutality which the detective frequents.  He encounters a ruthless gangster with a Beverly Hills mansion, Paul Stewart, who says with admiration, ""You handle yourself well, Hammer"" after he employs his handiwork on one of Stewart's thugs, Jack Lambert, who operates in a shadowy tandem with Jack Elam.
Eventually Hammer follows the trail to a turncoat scientist played by Albert Dekker, who is holding his secretary captive at his Malibu beach house.  The object of concern is a box with highly explosive contents, as both Hammer and Velda discover by film's end.
A major question surrounds the film.  Critics and historians debate whether or not Hammer actually survives at the end of the film.  See the explosive ending and decide for yourself.",1019692800,8,3814,5.09967845659164

Unlike most films that feature a strong hero who makes his own rules, ""Kiss Me Deadly"" doesn't sugarcoat the basic fascism of such a character.  In this story, Hammer isn't even a paticularly good detective.  His practice consists of whoring out his beautiful and adoring secretary, Velda (Maxine Cooper), to set up married men for blackmail.  His investigation in this case basically consists of following up on names that have been handed to him, usually by Velda.  Along the way, he smashes fingers and slaps faces until the disastrous finale, which leaves Hammer no wiser and no better off than he was before.

7873902,5,6304508549,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Kiss Me Deadly released by Criterion in 2011.

This is an excellent release and highly recommended for fans of Mike Hammer, film noir and even science fiction.
This movie also serves as a kind of a time capsule for old Los Angeles.

BLU-RAY: The picture is excellent. It is presented in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. Inside the booklet that comes with this release there is information on the film transfer. It says that on a standard tv that it will appear letterboxed and that there will be bars if on the side if you watched on a wide screen tv as I did. The HD digital transfer was made from a 35mm master positive. Dirt, debris, scratches, etc. were manually removed. The monaural soundtrack was remastered.

PLOT/SUMMARY:  The movie opens with a naked girl running out onto a road that Mike Hammer is driving on one evening. Mike drives off the road and gives the girl a ride. She tells Mike that she was put in a mental institution and to ""Remember Me."" Shortly they are stopped by some thugs. They kill the girl and beat up Mike and send him and his car over a cliff. Mike survives and wakes up in a hospital. He is now determined to find out why the girl was killed and go after the girl's killers.
From here the story takes several turns. Mike follows up leads throughout Los Angeles and eventually comes across a glowing case. It is implied that the case is the material for a nuclear bomb. Velda ends up getting kidnapped and Mike goes after Velda.

EXTRA'S: There are plenty of extra's with this release. This is a strong point of this release. They are as follows:
1) Double sided cover sleeve with the chapters on the reverse.
2) 20 page booklet - There are two articles, ""The Thriller of Tomorrow"" by J. Hoberman and ""You Can't Hang Up the Meat Hook"" by Robert Aldrich, the director. There is also information on the restoration and credits and photographs.
3) Audio Commentary by film noir specialists Alain Silver and James Ursini.
4) Video tribute by director Alex Cox - This was quite entertaining to listen to. Cox has that sarcastic humor that so many of the British have.
5)The Long Haul of A.I. Bezzerides, a documentary on the screenwriter of Kiss Me Deadly.
6)Mike Hammer's Mickey Spillane - This is a documentary made in 1998 of Mickey Spillane. Spillane is his usual entertaining self in his interview. He tells lots of stories and elaborates on his feelings about the Mike Hammer films. He did not like Kiss Me Deadly when it came out and he says he left the theater half way though the movie.
7)Film's Locations - You get to see comparisons of all the locations when filmed and how they look today.
8) Altered Ending - Self explanatory. The altered ending is not a different ending, it just cuts out the final minute of the movie and places 'The End' over the burning house.
9) Theatrical Trailer

All in all, some excellent extra's!

PRODUCTION: The movie had a budget of around $400,000 and was filmed in locations around Los Angeles in 1955.

There are two different endings to this movie. There had been rumors that the original has Mike Hammer die in the house at the end as the house burns down....or at least he isn't shown escaping so you can assume that. It is true that this version exists but it is not the original ending. The original ending is the one presented in this release where Mike and Velda escape to the beach. The alternate ending is the one that was shown sometime after the first release that shows the house burning with the words The End superimposed over it. This one has the last minute cut from it showing Mike and Velda running away.

This movie was not easy to get made. At the time, Mike Hammer had a reputation for being extremely violent and the censors didn't want to approve the movie. One of the ways that they got the movie approved was by Mike Hammer not using his gun. His gun is taken away by Pat early on in the movie.

There are distinct differences between the book and the movie. The most obvious difference is that in the book the 'bad guys' are the mafia not some guys (terrorists?) trying to get their hands on a nuclear bomb.
Also, Mike's main occupation is basically catching cheating spouses in the act. He uses Velda to set up the husbands.

The title's meaning was changed with an ever so slight change. The book has a comma in it's title after Kiss Me. So it reads Kiss Me, Deadly. This movie does not, thus changing the message of the title.

THOUGHTS/COMMENTS: I agree with most critics who say that Ralph Meeker was the best Mike Hammer. While he didn't have the rough look you might imagine from the books, he is a large guy and has a tough demeanor.

I loved the fact that this movie was not shot in a studio and that most of the locations are filmed in old Los Angeles. You get to see many locations that don't exist in the same state anymore, most notably, the Bunker Hill scenes.

This story, like many detective stories gets a bit confusing if you don't really pay attention. I had to go back a few times because I couldn't remember who all the people named were.

I did not like the casting of Maxine Cooper as Velda. I've read all of the Mike Hammer books and Cooper is just not what I had pictured in my head as Velda. I always imagined a more glamorous looking girl.

While Mike Hammer's violent nature was toned down for this movie by necessity in order to get it made, he does exhibit some violent behavior in other ways than shooting people. He uses his fists to beat up a mugger before throwing him down a long staircase. He smashes a collector's valuable record and he slams a drawer shut on an old man's hand.

I liked the implication that the glowing case was Pandora's Box and the very creepy noise it made when opened.

RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: I think that this is an excellent release by Criterion. I'm giving it 5 stars based on the excellent picture and excellent extra's.

Highly recommended for fans of Mike Hammer and also for fans of science fiction films of the 50's. The movie is included in Bill Warren's excellent 'Keep Watching the Skies,' a book on all science fiction films from 1950-1962. It is included for the reason that the Pandora's Box in the movie sort of  allows this movie to be called science fiction. If they had stuck to the book's story line then this would not be so.",1493510400,4,6344,4.466724286949006
