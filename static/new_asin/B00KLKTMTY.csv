8659768,1,B00KLKTMTY,"I don't know why, but I didn't realize America's Most Haunted was a movie. It's a crew ghosthunting, like the show Ghosthunters. But, it was very poorly made. Not well written, dumb jokes. All the other movies also seemed low-budget movies, kind of cheesy. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone. In fact, I wonder if I can get my money back. I guess SOMEONE has to be the guinea pig.  :?",1421798400,,390,4.342465753424658
