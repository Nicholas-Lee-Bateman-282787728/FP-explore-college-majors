2403295,1,B000B66GVK,"Holy Ca Ca! This movie is so bad, I can't even describe, so bare with me. So what happens when Zombies take over the world, the survivors in City...? your guess is as good as mine.  Take refuge in an empty ware house. In fact thats where 97% of this film takes place. The other3% takes place in the woods surrounding the Ware house.

This movie looks like its shot on lowgrade video tape. The acting is so bad, its almost like the actors are reading off Cue Cards. Honestly it looks like someones Video Class homework.

Now, if Zombies take over the world and you have to defend yourself with the only practical kind of weapon-guns wouldn't you get the best stuff? Yeah not these guys, about 95% of guns being used, look like cap guns, or something smaller than a 38 snub nose revolver.

There is some gore in this film but, because of the video quality the picture was shot on, and the bad acting coupled with bad directing the gory parts of this movie seem very fake. Example, in one part of the film a zombie gets his leg blasted off just below the knee, when the zombie is rolling around on the ground with No leg, you can see the actor has his lower leg in a hole with the latex and prosthetics around his knee. So lame.

When this movie finally ended, I honestly said 'theres an hour and a half of my life I'm never getting back.'  I think I'm just a bit less intelligent because I watched it.  How about that!  Bottom Line....Terrible, not worth the plastic that its printed on.",1156032000,8,1485,4.297491039426523
2403296,1,B000B66GVK,"I gave this one star only because I coudn't give it anything less. This was perhaps the worst film, even by low-budget horror standards, simply for the fact that nothing ruins a production faster than bad acting and bad dialogue. And this film exhibited both. The dialogue, the writing, the acting, especially the lack of character development, which did nothing more than to create an ensemble of pasteboard characters, was so poorly done that I would have to say that this was written by fourth graders for third graders. **Seriously, even if you like low budget horror films no matter how bad they may be, stay away from this one. This film is an insult to the art of horror.",1143158400,6,678,4.658333333333333
2403297,1,B000B66GVK,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Killjoy and Jason X were better this horrendous atrocity! The dialogue in this movie is mind numbingly stupid. Redneck Zombies, Zombie Doom, and Premutos: Lord of the Living Dead were Shakespearian compared to this. The characters were so retarded. Whenever they are barracaded in a room and zombies come in they just stand there not showing any emotion, they don't even try to escape. That part when Derrick slicese that girls throat in front of everybody was so stupid. It wasn't even stupid in a funny way. Everybody just stood there while he murders her and then after he kills her they finally decide to grab him, but they don't kill him they just let him go. I can't stress how stupid this movie is. Its ONLY redeeming quality is that it actualy has some good gore although they didn't use it properly. The gore was well done but it wasn't shocking or entertaining. the wwriters have no idea of how to write. They kill off the guy who should have been the star of the movie. He was the first character introduced and they did the most character development with him and yet they kill him off half way through the movie. And not even his girlfriend survived. She was killed by a zombie in a acrowded room. I guess no one felt like shooting the zombie for her and guess she didn't feel like getting up to walk away from the stumbling zombie. Her boyfriends daughter who is supposed to eight but is actually thirteen just sat right beside her watching her get disemboweled. I guess she didn't feel like warning her that a zombie was about to murder her and that she better move. PLease do not buy or even rent this stupid movie.",1141689600,2,1673,4.470588235294118
2403298,2,B000B66GVK,"...about this flick.

Well lately all that has been released are low budget Zombie flicks, which is common, but these being really low I mean bad acting which in much of a sense really hurts these movies that have potential and would be alot better if maybe just maybe a somewhat known actor or 2 who could act would be involved in the film.

The plot is ok being its world war 3 and some sort of radioactive chemicals are turning people into Zombies. Which leads a couple diffenerent groups of families and individuals to oddly meet up in the middle of know where in some type of ware house.

Now the setting and everything just don't work the way all these characters seem to meet just doesnt fit and where they get where they are and why the hell they are there, along with alot of useless dialogue makes the flick get very boring very quickly and hard to keep you focused as I watched in 3 intravals just to get through it.

The cover art looks great which I think is very misleading, but the Zombies are well done for the budget as well as the gore is pretty good, that is a definite plus for this flick. Maybe if they would have cut down the amount of $$ they put towards the make-up effects and concentrated more on  using that cash to get some actors that were at least  better or for that were even able to act this flick would have been a bit better.

These film needs alot of work to become anything good, and I hate to knock a writer and director and the rest of the crew as they did the best they could, great , bu tim here to give my opinion on the movie not the effort.

the price for this is decent which can make it worth the money if you are into movies with very bad acting very low budgets and a plot where everything is out of place, but is quit GORY, then this is your flick. And like I said the make up effects for themost part are the only plus in this film as there is alot of it and it is quit well done something know one can knock.

You can rent it at blockbuster as I did, and  maybe Hollywood video would have it as well. Its better off to give it a rent b4 buying it off amazon and wasting $14.00 plus the shipping for a very bad acted and set movie, but if you like violence and blood and can just sit there through this pretty bad movie just to view that then get you will be happy.

I remeember Primal Fear was selling this on there website for $24 plus delievery and they were saying on the site get it b4 it is released for more money in stores, yeah well it wasn't released for more and glad I waited, plus they are making a part 2. I juist don't understand.",1131494400,3,2595,4.068627450980392
2403319,5,B000B66GVK,"Zombie Night is a great B flick for zombie lovers! It was obviously a low budget film but if enough people see it I suspect it would have a cult following that would rival ""Night of the Living Dead"".",1356652800,,199,4.128205128205129
2403320,4,B000B66GVK,"First off let me say that the only reason this movie did not get five stars is because is was too short.  I want more Zombie Night!
This may very well be the greatest zombie movie ever made and it is all due to the amazing acting performances that brought to life some of the most memorable and complex characters ever.  The plot is simple, enough survive a zombie apocalypse.  But that would have been too easy so the director added some personal touches to put the characters at greater risk.  First, in this part of the world, no one has ever heard of a rifle or a shotgun and semi automatic pistols seem to be a new and exciting technology.  The characters strike out on to survive on this damned earth with nothing more than the smallest of revolvers.  Which definitely adds to the level of difficulty when fighting off more than 5 zombies.
Second, no one is allowed to run at full speed.  Again, with the average speed of a zombie a rough .3 miles an hour, running away from them is like taking candy from a baby.  So the director obviously told them to run as if they had just learned to walk five minutes ago and act as uncoordinated as possible, basically act like a new born zebra evading a female lion.
And third, which is the most genius of all, pretend to have absolutely zero common sense or ability to analyze the consequences of your actions.  When faced with a mindless enemy, out thinking them and surviving into old age with ease would make for a very boring movie.  These characters were developed to allow for as much drama and suspense possible in a 91 minutes.  Why else would they keep allowing Derek to live and escape.
That brings me to the cast of characters in Zombie Night.  There are three main characters in the movie; Dave, that damn Derek and Keith (the English black guy).  Dave is the leader of the ""good"" group who is just trying to survive this crazy world.  Danny Ticknovich should have been given an oscar for his performance.  Never has a more believable buffoon been brought to life on screen.  Dave screws everything up so well you begin to wonder what side he is really on. Keith, the greatest hero of modern cinema, is tall black guy with a British accent that appears to have the only ounce of sense in the whole group.  If he had been put in charge, the movie would have been too boring as no one would have died and that damn Derek would have been killed in the first five minutes.  And he is johnny on the spot with his tiny revolver, saving many fools from certain death.  Then there is Derek, Keith's nemesis and the greatest  villan since Nicholson's Joker.  This man kills without remorse on numerous occasion and is still allowed to live after being caught numerous times by the aforementioned ""Dave"".  I mean, he slit a girl's throat for no reason, and still Dave stops Keith from capping him.  Tragic.  He also rips a girl's shirt off, who of course is not wearing a bra, just because.  Why Derek why?  What makes a man become so evil?
There you have it.  In summary watch Zombie Night so your life can be complete and you can die happy.",1314403200,4,3092,4.407407407407407
2403321,1,B000B66GVK,"I would LOVE to know the story behind the making of this atrocity.

2403325,1,B000B66GVK,"This movie must have been made as a gag reel ... the longest gag reel you have ever seen! There's no other explanation. Never before have I seen a movie where every single ""actor"" is so bad it is inconceivable that these people were serious about making a movie.

I do like zombie movies and I first encountered Zombie Night at the video store as a rental. I could not believe it when I got through the movie at home. I actually watched [in disbelief] the whole thing ! This movie could quit possibly take the not so coveted title of ""Worst Movie EVER Made"" away from Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space. [and it's bad!]

Problem is .... it IS so bad, it IS so poorly made, packed with really really bad acting, a horribly conceived, horribly delivered, and listless dialog, cheesy in every way imaginable ... yet I found myself having to own a copy of Zombie Night! [Pretty clever marketing eh?]
OK .. I admit it ....I found a copy for about 4 bucks on Ebay and proceded to add this travesty of a movie to my collection, filed under the So Bad it's Good Fun category.

While totally void of any perceivable production values, there IS, albeit in a strange way, SO much entertainment value to this movie. Not exactly what the producers of this dog had in mind I'm sure but still entertaining and laughable nonetheless.
You'll quickly find yourself cheering and rooting for the zombies in this movie .. at least they didn't have any dialog! For every victim that succumbs to a zombie's wrath, there is one less lousy actor whose insipid dialog you have to digest.

If you are looking for a good zombie movie ... this ain't it. If you like movies that are so bad they're good that masquerades as a zombie movie ... well then ... Zombie Night is the one to get !

Yikes !!!! I think they even made a sequel!",1241654400,,1802,4.367164179104478
2403326,1,B000B66GVK,"Zombie Night (David J. Francis, 2004)

Here's a tip, aspiring makers of zombie movies: the zombies are supposed to be the bad guys, not your intended audience.

Zombie Night, the first and only film written by (and featuring, in a small role) the late Amber Lynn Francis, is a movie I feel terrible about trashing. But, you know, the piece of poetry that shows at the beginning of the movie tells you all you need to know about this movie; it's awful. Where can you go from there? Yes, you can-- no matter how far down you are, there's always a gutter beneath you.

The episodic, rambling script hands us Dave (Danny Ticknovich), his wife Shelley (Sandra Segovic), and their daughter Amber (Andrea Ramolo) as main characters. They've been up in the woods in a cabin for two weeks with no contact with the outside world; when they come back to civilization, it's been overrun by zombies. They don't know that at first, however, because the zombies only come out at night. (Oddly, I can't remember ever seeing that twist in a zombie movie before, so points for originality.) As they try to survive, they stumble into other survivors, including dashing male-lead Rick (Jason Riley) and psychotic Derek (Duane Moniz), along with a bunch of others, putting together a band of survivors to try and find someplace safe and stable where they can barricade themselves in. (Until what?, you may ask yourself. Until what?, indeed.) Of course, everything that can go wrong does.

The script is pretty standard-- the zombies are basically window dressing, with most of the action focusing on the survivors and the power struggles within the group, as most good zombie films do. It's got some interesting twists in it, as well (the ""only coming out at night"" theme is only one of the variations). However, as good as the script may have been, its realization is a complete mess. The acting never rises above the level of substandard. The director shows the potential to become competent, but doesn't realize any of it here; the angles always seem just a touch off, the lighting is either a bit too dark or a bit too light, etc. And the acting. I've seen some really basement-budget pictures staffed entirely with no-name actors that have blown me away (Shallow Ground, recently, comes to mind). This is not one of them. There was better acting in Midnight Skater. And that's saying something.

Some have opined that this falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category. I can certainly see that; this is definitely a movie with which one could come up with any number of great drinking games. But as a serious piece of zombie cinema, it's better than Day of the Dead 2: Contagium. But not much. *",1212105600,,2677,4.711538461538462
