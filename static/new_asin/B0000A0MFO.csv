8195305,4,B0000A0MFO,"1.  Why is buying the first 3 sesons bundled more expensive than buying them seperately.
2.  Why is buying them at Sam's Club cheaper (even with sales tax)
3.  What are other's views on the poor transfer from tape to DVD?  There are plenty of web sites out there that rip the DVD releases to shreds because of heads cut off due to improper transfer and artefacts on the CGI's...
Otherwise the story arcing is excellent :)  Good effects, good characters (although I wish the mimbari weren't so damned goody goody)",1071100800,8,512,4.582417582417582
8195306,5,B0000A0MFO,"Babylon 5 is a five mile long space station.  Located deep in neutral territory, it is designed to prevent intergalactic war by providing a place where peace can be worked out between the races.  Run by Earth, it was built with help from the Minbari after our war with them when we were almost wiped out.  Since it is also a trade station, it attracts allies of all kinds on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, it also attracts trouble.  There are raiders in the area, the Narn and Centauri have at best a fragile peace, and someone is always trying to smuggle something on board.  Even worse, an ancient enemy is rebuilding forces, and the effects of this will reach all the way back to Earth.
Babylon 5 is still unique in television.  It set out to tell a single story that had been mapped out beforehand.  As a result, it sucks you in and doesn't let you go until you've reached the end.  Season 1 is the most uneven, but the beginnings of the story are there, and it lays the background on the races and cultures we will be dealing with over the course of the show.  Season 2 brings a new captain and a storyline that is gaining speed, while season 3 brings surprises and increasing tension.
Of course, if you are looking at this page, odds are you are already a fan and looking for information on the sets.  The picture, presented in widescreen, is hit and miss, with some dust popping up occasionally.  It is clear and sharp most of the time, however.  Sound is presented in full surround and has never sounded better.  Each set contains two audio commentaries by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and a season intro by cast and crew.  They also have some behind the scenes documentaries and encyclopedia entries introducing you to the world of Babylon 5.  In addition, seasons 2 and 3 have one audio commentary each by various cast members.
Whether you buy the seasons bundled like this or individually, don't miss your chance to own this fantastic TV series.",1070928000,,1964,4.5397727272727275
8195307,5,B0000A0MFO,"Anyone who knows the babylon 5 universe, knows  how great this  novel that was not an actual novel is. I watched the stories many times esspecially now that it is in syndication. What is great about the dvds version is that  we get soem of the back ground information that is helpful. Any sci-fi fan, or anyone who is interested in the future would love this series.",1068336000,,366,4.432835820895522
8195308,5,B0000A0MFO,"In my opinion, this is the best season yet for action lovers. Along with more romance as well. The end of this one leaves on the edge of your seat and you just cannot wait for Season 4 to come out. To bad its so long away before Season 4 is released.",1060905600,,250,3.826923076923077
