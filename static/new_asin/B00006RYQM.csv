7972868,4,B00006RYQM,"In the past I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about Curt Mitchell and his DVDs. Some say they are great while other have not so nice things to say. I will say this, Curt doesn't have the best on screem personality, but his knowledge of the guitar and particuler Tremonti overshadows his lack of stage presence.  In this DVD Curt shows you some of Tremonti's style and in particuler how to play My Sacrifice, My Own Prison, Higher, With Arms Wide Open, and many more. If you are good at reading and understanding tab, you may not need this DVD. On the otherhand, if you have a hard time with tab buy it you will learn something. Also since Tremonti is a master of the ""Drop D"" tuning this DVD is good to work on that.",1173916800,,718,4.202898550724638
