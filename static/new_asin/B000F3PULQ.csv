8116873,4,B000F3PULQ,"This Navy series was a contemporary of ""The Silent Service"", another series, in the 1950s. Both recount stories generated by WW2. Navy Log in particluar covers a wide range of naval events with familiar 1950s TV actors. The show integrates WW2 footage with the production and gives it a good flavor of the sea struggle during the war. It is nostalgiac television and those around in the 1950s will appreciate the sentimental trip back to a TV world that entertained without sex, violence, drugs, crashes, and impossible stories like those that currently make television a wasteland.",1316822400,13,582,5.072916666666667
