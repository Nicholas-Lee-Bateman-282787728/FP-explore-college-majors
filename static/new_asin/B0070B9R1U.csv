5046123,5,B0070B9R1U,Got this as a gift for my mom for Christmas. She loves the Dark Shadows series from TV. I am hoping to get all of the collections for her. Thank you.,1356048000,4,149,3.838709677419355
5046124,5,B0070B9R1U,I love re-watching the series that held my attention as a teenager....Still holds my attention and is fun to watch,1353196800,3,114,4.75
5046125,5,B0070B9R1U,"All Dark Shadows episodes in all the collections I bought so far has excellent picture: clear and bright with vivid colors.  The sound is also excellent.  The dialogues and the accompanying music are clear.  If you are a baby boomer or if you were a teen in the '70s like I was and only caught a few episodes back then, here is your chance to watch all of them.  If you are just curious and find the macabre entertaining I would begin with collection 1, but be warned, once you start you won't be able to stop watching.  Be sure to order enough collections ahead of time, so you won't be left ""hanging in the air"" until the next shipment arrives.  If you haven't seen the movie, I would recommend not seeing it until you've finished most or all of the collections.",1352851200,9,764,4.345070422535211
5046126,5,B0070B9R1U,It was great to see the backstory of how Barnabas became a vampire.  I can't wait to watch Collection 6!,1349827200,6,104,4.2
5046127,5,B0070B9R1U,"These episodes of ""Dark Shadows"" found on this disc contain the shows starting with the December, 1967 episodes that propell Victoria Winters back in time to 1795 when it is revealed why Barnabas Collins became a vampire. These episodes dramatize how Barnabas is reaquainted with Angelique, a woman he knew in Europe and had an affair with, but unknown to him possess magical powers. While at Collinwood years later Barnabas is getting ready to marry the love of his life, Jossette DuPres, but Barnabas soon discovers Angelique is Jossette's maid and lady-in-waiting. Angelique is not impressed when Barnabas refuses her advances and this is when the story really takes off.

 If your a new fan of ""Dark Shadows"" and can't afford the exquisite box set that MPI has out (that features all 1225 episodes) this is really a good place to start to get to realize how well-written and acted this supernatural soap opera is. Trust me: upon viewing this disc you will want more ""Dark Shadows"" and luckily MPI has released the shows in idividual sets to make it more affordable for consumers.

 The shows are uncut, cleaned from their master copies and look divine especially after 40 years!!",1347408000,32,1183,4.9

5046142,4,B0070B9R1U,"The 1795 storyline is almost an acquired taste. You have to really be into the story and the characters. Three years ago, this storyline really tested my patience because of certain annoying characters like Abigail Collins and the infamous Reverend Trask. Now, I'm re-watching it, and it has grown on me quite a bit. I can see the beauty and the tragedy in the storyline now. There are some great sets, beautiful imagery, interesting storylines, and some awesomely cheesy moments that make this series so great. This review WILL contain spoilers, so be warned!

After a seance, Victoria Winters is transported back in time to the year 1795, before Barnabas was an evil vampire and about to marry the love of his life, Josette. The family from present time play the family in the past, so Victoria keeps telling them they look like someone she knows. Her actions and words from the modern world get her into trouble when crazy aunt Abigail believes that Vicky is a witch. Barnabas's father, Joshua doesn't believe in witches and allows Vicky to be a Governess to his daughter, Sarah.

Soon, Josette arrives to get ready for the big Wedding, but someone in the house wants to tear them apart. Josette's beautiful maid, Angelique is in love with Barnabas and will do anything to get him, along with the help of her witchy powers. Hearts are broken, and lives are lost. If you love classic gothic soap operas, I'm sure you'll love DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION 5!!!",1428883200,2,1455,4.76984126984127

5046162,5,B0070B9R1U,"Out of all the episodes, this collection has some of the best scenes acted that helped make Dark Shadows  the favorite show to watch.  Nothing high tech and there are some good laughs when the camera catches behind the scene personnel.  The set decorations of 1795 and costumes are very good in my opinion.",1369353600,,306,4.62962962962963

5046164,5,B0070B9R1U,"Collection 5 exceeded my expectations!  I watched the show as a child but I started watching after collection 5 was aired.  It clears up so much for those of us who became fans later on in the show.  The Barnabus, Joesette, and Angelique triangle is surpurb.  I've enjoyed the period costumes and the set design as well.  I loved Dark Shadows so much as a child and was afraid I'd find it rather cheesy as an adult, but I was thrilled to find it wasn't the case.

Fun and just scary enough. in a world that encourages our kids to grow up too fast, this is a welcome relief.",1362096000,,396,4.577464788732394

8507660,5,B0070B9R1U,"Yes!!! I'm still addicted to Dark Shadows. This Gothic soap is very engrossing and still keeps me on the edge of my seat even after watching 200 episodes thus far. So engrossing that I have to will my hand to aim the remote at the DVR and press ""OFF"" or I will easily binge watch, in one sitting, four to six or more!!! of the 20 minute episodes. Part of the charm of this soap lies in its imperfections. Sometimes you'll see ""digital snow"" (flashes of multiple pixelated boxes instead of analog black, white and gray ""snow""). Sometimes you'll see a shadow of a microphone and the boom pole moving in and out of the shot. Sometimes you'll see stage hands in the corner of the shot before they realize they can be seen on camera and are quick to move out of frame. At times you'll hear off-camera bangs and sometimes even words being spoken that are not related to the script. You'll also see a few of the cheapest and cheesiest of props and the barest of minimum, special effects. At times the actors flubbed their lines (and that, at times, can be a little awkward to watch) and had to think fast and try to save the scene by ad-libbing  (which they did well most of the time) but after I had discovered that they had had little time to memorize and rehearse the script, it all became very understandable and made me respect the actors all the more. It's in episode 365 of collection 4 (371 is the last episode of collection 4) that a seance is held in Collinwood and (SPOILER ALERT) Victoria Winters is transported back to year 1795. All the actors in the present time (the 1960s) are now different characters in 1795. (Joan Bennett is now Naomi Collins. Kathryn Leigh Scott is now Josette Dupres, Jerry Lacy is now Reverend Trask, etc). Alexandra Moltke and Jonathan Frid continue on in the roles of Victoria Winters and Barnabas Collins. Lara Parker, who is introduced to the show in the last few episodes of collection 4 and throughout all of collection 5,  is fantastic in her role. She plays Angelique Bouchard who is a servant to Josette Dupres. Josette Dupres is engaged to Barnabas Collins and they are to marry after she, her aunt (played by Grayson Hall) and Angelique arrive in Collinsport Maine. Unknown to the other characters, Angelique is a witch and is secretly in love with Barnabas Collins. Parker's beautiful face had a maniacal quality to it that enhanced her ""character's believability"" and overall performance. At first you'll feel hatred towards Angelique, then you'll fear her and at the end of collection 5, you'll begin to realize that she is redeemable, capable of love and you'll begin to sympathize with her. There are a lot of twists and turns in this collection and I love and appreciate every single one of them. This collection is one of the best so far. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of  the 1025 episodes of this outstanding classic! I VERY HIGHLY recommend this classic soap !!",1529107200,,2926,4.590822179732314

8507668,5,B0070B9R1U,"Dark Shadows Collection Five contains episodes 372-412, which originally aired between late November 1967 and January 1968. Although this was about 400-odd episodes and a year-and-a-half into the series run, essentially these episodes contain the start of the Dark Shadows saga; telling how Barnabas Collins went from being mere mortal to immortal vampire with a tortured soul.

For the most part Dark Shadows was set in contemporary Maine of the late 1960s, however, these episodes (along with episodes immediately proceeding and following them) take place in the late eighteenth century. Rather than using flashbacks to tell Barnabass origin story, the shows creative team decided instead to have one of the shows main characters, Victoria Winters,. mysteriously travel back in time during a seance that occurs in Collection Four (she was replaced at the seance table by a young woman from the past, but this storyline is completely left hanging in subsequent episodes. T

he result is an suspenseful storyline about a young woman out of her time, struggling to adjust to a different world, and falling under the suspicion of being a witch. At one point a fanatical preacher is called in to conduct an exorcism, making for some of the most intense scenes thus far in the series (and his initial appearance, when he shows up at the front door at Collinswood, is almost a dead ringer for the iconic show of Father Merrin appearing at the house of Georgetown to conduct the most famous exorcism in pop cultural history several years later).

The main focus in these episodes, however, is on the fatal love triangle between Barnabas, Josette, who is the love of his life, and Angelique, a real witch who doesnt hesitate to turn to the dark arts once it becomes clear where Barnabass heart really lies. The result is a highly entertaining gothic romance/horror show, with a full compliment of witches, spells, duels, zombies, ghouls, religious zealots, and vampires.

In terms of production values, it is important to remember that this is a daily TV soap opera produced in the late 1960s. Considering what had to be tremendous time and budgetary constraints, the overall result is impressive, only a flying fake bat gives off any hint of cheesiness.

As with previous Dark Shadows collections from M.P.I., the sound and picture quality are quite good, unlike some collections, Volume 5 includes no lost episodes that can only be reproduced now by filmed kinescope copies. The DVD packaging includes original airdates and brief plot summaries for each episode, and each disc concludes with contemporary interviews with former cast and crew members, which provide insight into the inner workings of the show.

Given the storyline, Dark Shadows Collection 5 is a must-have for any Dark Shadows fan, either casual or completist.",1478217600,3,2822,5.097402597402597
