2868616,5,B000RKBQBU,"I love the Seinfeld television show so much. Season 1 has so much to offer, seeing these beloved characters as the actors were discovering how to portray them. If you are a long time fan or just wanting to see what the fuss is about, you can't go wrong checking out Season 1 of Seinfeld.",1329350400,,287,4.236363636363636
2868617,5,B000RKBQBU,"Thanks amazon I got it quickly... And its perfect.. so funny, I want to buy the second season and other one now...",1328572800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2868618,5,B000RKBQBU,"Contrary to other reviews, I love the 1st season just as much as the last! I am a hardcore Seinfeld lover, and this season was no disappointment. I'll be honest, I didn't like the pilot that much, but after that the characters are as true to themselves as always. If you love Seinfeld, you'll love this DVD.",1327017600,,307,4.4035087719298245
2868619,5,B000RKBQBU,"I completed the series for my boyfriend for his birthday and we have yet to watch all of them,  but he was very very happy!",1319241600,,123,3.92
2868620,4,B000RKBQBU,"Seinfeld's first ""season"" is actually only five episodes, as NBC hadn't fully committed to the show yet.  When these episodes got a decent reception, the network ordered thirteen more, which make up Season Two.  These first two seasons are combined in another box set, or fans can get the first mini-season by itself for next to nothing (seriously, this DVD is going for less than $2 brand new on Amazon).  In the first few episodes, the cast and staff are obviously trying to feel out the show's premise and the characters, but I think they do a great job of starting to find its rhythm.  Kramer is the most noticeably different, appearing as an eccentric shut-in at first that is quite a contrast to the ""hipster dufus"" he becomes.  George is already transitioning from a caricature of Woody Allen to one of Larry David by the fifth episode.  And Elaine probably seems the most like her character from later seasons, as Julia Louis-Dreyfuss seemed to know from the start what she wanted to do with the character.  As for Jerry...well, he's just Jerry, if maybe a little less an actor than later.  The Stake Out is the one episode of the first five that offers a glimpse of the show's full potential, and the others are funny; not hilarious like they started to be during some of Season Two, but funny.  Even before Seinfeld got great, it was better than most of the other sitcoms on TV.",1313193600,10,1388,4.587044534412955
2868621,5,B000RKBQBU,"Seinfeld is the best!  Although Season 1 in my opinion is not as funny as the later seasons are, it is a must own for the Seinfeld collection.  Lots of smiles and fun nonetheless.",1301097600,,179,4.235294117647059
2868622,1,B000RKBQBU,"This is a bad deal--there are only 5 episodes. The better deal is to purchase the season 1 & 2 combo pack, since there are 5 and 13 episodes, respectively. Monetarily, it is better to purchase the combo pack.",1290470400,4,208,4.358974358974359
2868623,5,B000RKBQBU,Bought this as a gift for my brother he's a seinfeld fan so he loves it and can watch it whenever he wants to now,1274745600,,113,3.56
2868624,5,B000RKBQBU,"I am sure it will happen eventually, once Blu-ray gets into more homes.  I will re-buy all the seasons IF they put more features on Blu-ray than what is on the DVD's.  As everybody knows Blu-ray can hold much more than DVD's so they should put more stuff on it.  If they do I will sell all my seasons on dvd and buy them on Blu-ray.",1261094400,10,332,4.0

8201128,5,B000RKBQBU,"SEINFELD.  The first episode is like a delicious potato chip..nobody can eat just one.  And so I'm going to sum up the entire bag!  Google the phrase Theyre real, and they're spectacular!, and youll immediately see a video clip of Teri Hatcher in her memorable appearance on Seinfeld.  And the same holds true for the Show itself its real, and its spectacular!  From the soup nazi to Festivusa holiday for the rest of us!  This once in a lifetime show about nothing is really something!  It will forever be fresh and funny because it's about us and our human nature; and it's unlike any sitcom before or since.  It has metastasized (in a good way) countless dozens of quotes that have virtually become part of the English language.  And each quote conjures up hilarious scenes that crack us up every time. And no subject is off limits, as when Elaine asks ""Can you spare a square?"" or when she's trying to decide if a guy is ""sponge-worthy"". Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David are funny.  Humor can be studied and formulated, but you gotta be born with a built-in funny bug in order to make the entire world laugh, as these two geniuses have done. They might even come up with another winner; but when its done right the first time, once is enough.",1524096000,,1244,4.538116591928251
8201129,3,B000RKBQBU,"I love Seinfeld and so I bought these two seasons but was surprised at the quality of playback. It looked liked it was 20 years old. Also my version kept getting out of sync - the audio portion was often out of sync with the video, like an old Japanese movie from my youth that had been dubbed. But I was able to correct this by pausing and then going to Resume a few times. Annoying but I got all episodes to work. Otherwise - whats not to like with vintage Seinfeld?",1522972800,,468,4.0978260869565215

How about shows with Native Americans, Hispanics or Latinos.  Enough of the same looking faces all day all night.  We need more diversity already.",1517616000,,292,4.76
