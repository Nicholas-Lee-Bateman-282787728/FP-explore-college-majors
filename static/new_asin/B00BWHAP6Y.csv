5679235,1,B00BWHAP6Y,"This looks and feels like a BAD made for TV version of the story.  With all the technological advances in special effects this version is a sub-par effort at best.

I wish they had followed the original story line, but no they had to write a ""heavy"" into the plot and put Michael Pare in the role.

The stars are not interesting, and the story line while having a great potential to keep the audience entertained; unfortunately, fails to deliver and moves along with the same slow pace that has the viewer wanting to get to the end of the movie as quickly as possible.  A low budget film that clearly shows it many faults.",1371686400,,491,4.212765957446808
5679237,3,B00BWHAP6Y,"Not as good as the original 80s classic, but good for an evenings entertainment. The original premise for this movie was from the alleged 1943 experiment to make a ship RADAR invisible (basically vibrating its electromagnetic field using degaussing coils at the same rate (frequency)as radar waves so they would be absorbed). This was proven possible by the Chorum's (scientist brothers -full story of it is available on the web)but highly impractical due to the high electromagnetic field power/energy required and the weight of the equipment needed to handle it. The story goes that invisibility in visible light, teleportation, and time travel effects were discovered as well as injury/illness caused to the crew. Most probably exaggerations on multiple retellings. (for example the men ""fused in the deck"" portrayed in the movie was probably just men burned to the metal and sticking to it -a common effect of burn injuries. The movie is based on  the book ""the Philadelphia experiment"" and its ""read a likes"". There are several novelizations based on the book too.",1371600000,,1069,5.179190751445087

Michael Pare shows up as well and does a very convincing job at being very ruthless and determined. Having also seen the original when it came out they both have merit and they both succeeded at being entertaining.",1371081600,,386,4.594202898550725

5679240,4,B00BWHAP6Y,"*I received an advance copy of this film for review; I am in no way being compensated for this review.

Director Paul Ziller may not be a name you are familiar with, but he is responsible for several Syfy Channel projects that I have enjoyed.  I can now add THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT to that list of titles.  This film is a remake from an 80s classic, but I have to admit that it definitely does the original justice.  While filled with typical Syfy Channel-budget special effects (meaning they're mediocre), the film itself is taut and tense, a welcome excursion into science-fiction.

I have to be honest and confess that I didn't expect much when going into this one.  I remember the original from way back in the day, and I remember liking it...but I couldn't see how they could update the plot to fit into this century.  I'm glad I gave this film a chance, though...this is a fun watch and it's impressive to see how they improved upon the old one.

THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT is shot well and looks great from a cinematic standpoint.  Although it has a shoestring budget, the film looks expensive for the most part.  My sole complaint about the visuals, as I mentioned earlier, are the less-than-impressive CG effects which tend to run rampant in Syfy Channel films.  Thankfully, these are not so bad as to detract from the enjoyment of this movie.

I am particularly impressed with the acting in the film as well.  Nicholas Lea does a great job in his role, as do Michael Pare (who was also in the original film) and Emilie Ullerup.  But Malcolm McDowell steals the show for me.  I've been a fan of McDowell's work for many, many years, and he always impresses on-screen.  The same can be said here.

Overall, THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT is a win for me, and fans of Syfy Channel's movies will love this one.  I recommend giving it a look, although if you don't like what you see on Syfy, you probably won't like this one.",1370822400,,1932,4.566860465116279

5679254,5,B00BWHAP6Y,"*""The Philadelphia Experiment (2012)""* isn't perfect.  It has it's flaws.
But it's  one of the  most creative ""Philadelphia Experiment"" movies that I've seen!!

The *production values* are comparable to the original film (on a much smaller
budget!!), and in some ways this sequel is more exciting and intellectually
satisfying than the original film (""The Philadelphia Experiment (1984)"").

*The acting* generally ranges from good to very good.  *Nicholas Lea* (""Krycek""
on The X-Files), the great *Malcolm McDowell* (""Time After Time"" (1979)), *and*
*Michael Pare* (hero of the original film but a villain in this sequel) *turn in very*
*solid performances, as usual.*

With one exception who's skillfully marginalized, the *supporting cast* members are
generally very enjoyable too --even though they're relatively unknown actresses
and actors (which is sometimes a *good* thing, as it is here).

""Philadelphia Experiment (2012)"" creatively explores some *exciting unexpected
side effects* of the Philadelphia Experiment.  E.g., the battleship USS Eldridge keeps
whimsically disappearing, and then perilously reappearing some place where it really,
really should not be.  (The scene where the *Eldridge falls out of Hyperspace(n1)* right
on top of a Chicago skyscraper is awesome.  Kudos!!)

It's hard to explain *what's ""wrong""* with this movie, but I think its two of the characters.
""Deputy Carl Reed"" is completely unnecessary; and ""Dr. Richard Falkner's"" part is way
bigger than it should be --which slows down the movie and makes it less interesting.  That
time could have been spent on special effects.

Thankfully, somebody on the production team (maybe one of the writers) seems to have
spotted the  first problem, and they cleverly marginalized ""Deputy Carl Reed""  until the end
of the film.  (I suspect that some of the people who are hating on this movie were partial to
""Deputy Reed,"" because the criticisms don't make much sense otherwise.  Lol).

Michael Pare's admirably seasoned and physically fit.  But I had trouble accepting him as a *villain*
in this sequel.  Pare gave such a memorable performance as the *hero* of the original movie, that
the role-change was very confusing to me.  The role-change should have been explained.

The role-change won't be a surprise (and therefore shouldn't be a problem) when I watch this movie
for the second time, this weekend.  Besides, I'm a big Pare fan.  White guy kicks azz.  Lol.  Michael
Pare would have been a great ""Jason Bourne""!!

This is a good movie.  You''ll want to add it to your time travel collection.  ----PB

Bad writing, directing, acting, costuming, makeup, Shaky-Camabout the only way I could have hated this more is with greater use of the dreaded teal & orange grading. There is no depth to the characters or situations. The original was not a ""great"" movie, but it had atmosphere and characters who gave credibility to an incredible situation. This sequel / remake / reboot is utterly gratuitousstuff just happens. People hyperventilate, others chew up scenery with overacting. I'd rather watch 90 minutes of car ads on TV.

5679280,3,B00BWHAP6Y,"Some films just shouldn't be re-made, however Hollywood seldom agrees with that statement. In the case of the Philadelphia Experiment, there was oddly a consensus not to remake it. For almost a decade, people tried and failed to get it done. After almost every star and major film company rejected them, the re-make came out in 2012, as a direct-to-video feature, with a much smaller budget and a cast that just left people scratching their heads. For those unfamiliar with the story, The Philadelphia Experiment was a military operation, intended to transport matter, much in the same way as they do on Star Trek. It was first attempted in the 1940s and failed, as a ship was lost with all hands on board. In 1984, a private contractor attempts to revive the project and the ship, with one surviving crewman, miraculously returned. I always found this to be a clever story and I enjoyed the original, but to do a b-movie remake of the film was just ridiculous. For starters, the special effects in this film were worse than the ones they had in 1984, and they couldn't get anyone to star in this thing. Aside from Malcolm McDowell, who I'm convinced will do anything for a check, the cast is nothing more than a bunch of TV show extras, literally. Nicolas Lea, surprisingly does a very good job with the lead role, but what's one good performance, when combined with an inexperienced cast and no budget? For what it was, the re-make of the Philadelphia Experiment wasn't as bad as it could have been, mainly due to Nicolas Lea, but it certainly fails to live up to the original in every way possible.",1451779200,,1601,4.640845070422535

Maybe you can see why I was equal parts hyped and perturbed when I tuned in to this 2012 remake of The Philadelphia Experiment. Excuse me, that's Syfy's The Philadelphia Experiment.

As with the first flick, the remake takes its cues from the controversial, (supposedly) real-life secret experiments conducted by the U.S. Navy in the 1940's to produce a cloaking device that makes its warships invisible. Today, Gravewatch, a private corporation specializing in weapons development and with ties to the government, has dusted off the old WWII research project in another attempt to perfect invisibility. Cue the big snafu and the crackling light show and the panicky faces, and abruptly there's the WWII destroyer, the USS Eldridge 173 - failed subject of the first Naval test in 1943 - but now manifested on an airstrip 12 miles west of Philadelphia. Phrases like ""direct apportation"" are bandied about to explain away the phenomenon.

I always get stoked about time travel stories. There's just something about that fella from out of time. Here, our fish out of water is Chief Technician Lt. William Gardner (Nicholas Lea a.k.a. The X-Files' Krycek!). Gardner is the sole survivor of the Eldridge experiment in 1943 and when his ship got catapulted forward in time, he went along for the ride, regaining consciousness sometime after and marveling at how his shoes had somehow fused with the deck. An unsteady Gardner disembarks from the Eldridge and into the 21st century, roughly shod.

But Nicholas Lea ain't no Michael Par. Lea doesn't have that fancy forward slash on his e (like La). Seriously, though, Par in the original 1984 flick had me engrossed in his story arc. Lea, not so much. He doesn't get interesting until, in the 21st century, he stumbles across his grown-up granddaughter Molly Gardner (Emilie Ullerup). Molly, to me, is the more compelling character. She's a barista AND a hacker, and she's plucky. I do like the interaction between them, she the modern woman, he the old guard with the old-fashioned sensibilities. When he gets a peek into her closet, of course he can't help but ask: ""I don't mean to pry, but do you think that it's proper to have men's clothing in your home?""

Family dynamics aside, the other big plot revolves around the possible doomsday brought about by Gravewatch's dabbling with theoretical science. Its messing about has triggered wild energy spikes within the electromagnetic field and has bo11ocksed the phase generator... or something. The result is that the Eldridge is jumping from location to location and wreaking sciency havoc. I've bagged on Syfy for its poor production values, but that sight of the Eldridge precariously perched on top of that skyscraper in downtown Chicago is pretty badass.

What's a sci-fi thriller without a bad guy or two? Lovely Gina Holden plays a steely government agent who aims to ensure that the situation is secured properly, even if that means offing a witness here and there. In something of a swerve, Michael Par plays her relentless field operative, Hagen. Can the Gardners, with their seventy year generation gap, avoid capture and duck bullets and also save the world? Maybe with some help from Malcolm McDowell.

So, the 1984 version is better. This one is watchable but mediocre. The original just had more heart, to go with the bigger budget, the superior storyline, and the more dynamic lead. Was it wrong that even though Par was clearly the bad guy here, that I was still rooting for him?

A few notes: Molly's boyfriend, local deputy in jeans Carl (John Reardon), is introduced early on and seems on his way to play a significant role. But then he touches the weird, shimmery stuff - and you should never ever touch the weird, shimmery stuff - and promptly gets sucked into the Eldridge, his hand fused into the bulkhead (that's squid talk for ""wall""). It's a wasted opportunity to indulge in dual storytelling where you can take a break from one thread to cut to the other. Instead, for most of the film, Carl is this useless hand-stuck-in-the-wall creature.

The Philadelphia Experiment (2012) falls somewhere in the middle, and that's the kiss of death. It's not excellent enough for a word-of-mouth push, but neither is it gosh-awful enough to elicit those mocking laughs. The cast can't be faulted. I thought the acting was decent - Emilie Ullerup, pretty good; Nicholas Lea, wooden but serviceable; Par, older now but imposing and menacing. Instead, blame a script without distinction, those onerous chase sequences, and, on principle, the soulless Syfyness of it all that probably damned the movie from jump. A strictly middle-of-the-road 2.5 out of 5 stars.

I did like the coda.",1405728000,,5485,5.5750300120048015

5679319,1,B00BWHAP6Y,"Have you ever had a Chocolate Caramel Apple?  A firm fresh apple is first dipped in caramel.  When the caramel has firmed up the apple is then dipped in chocolate.  In order to make this special treat even more appealing it can be rolled in coconut, or nutty bits, even colorful sprinkles.  When out and about these special apples can cost a a whole pocketful of coins.

So there you are.  Just the sight of this covered goodness makes your mouth start to water.  You remember eating one just like it when you were younger and can still remember the wonderful taste.  On a whim you drop your money on the counter and collect your apple.  Tempting yourself, you start out by nibbling at the chocolate.  It melts in your mouth with barely a thought.  Next you go just a bit deeper, getting comfortable with a resurgence of good times long past.  The caramel and chocolate are a perfect blend, the caramel even stretches and strings off the apple.  Fully invested you settle in to fulfill your fancy and take a good sized bite.

Suddenly, without any warning you discover what you purchased isn't what you thought you were getting.  Instead of a sweat, crisp apple, the core of this treat is a sour onion...a rotten, bitter and unpalatable onion.  Then to compound the charade you realize this apple was no mere accident.  It was done intentionally.

Well folks, that's what you are going to find when you watch this movie.  [SPOILER ALERT]  It starts out with a refreshingly good take on the original story.  <This is not the original story if you haven't caught that via other comments>  The director laid out the groundwork for an 'edge of your seat' physiological thriller.  Then the Eldridge lands on the building....

That's all there is.  After the Eldridge ends up on top of a building I guess the director and producers got bored with the whole project.  Creating a quality physiological thriller was just too much darn work.  From that point on ones suspension of disbelief is destroyed.  Not by glaring negligence, no.  But by dozens of incorrect details such as police arriving at a location.  Shooting up a downtown area just to make noise, and an assortment of other inconsistencies which leave one, at least me anyway, shocked at the laziness displayed.

Still, if the little things don't take all the wind from your sails, having our reluctant time-traveler manage to take control of the forges of space/time...in order to reach out to the fans of ""Super Heroes"" I'm sure...in order to escape from an inescapable situation and save the girl, pretty much ends whatever aspect of a thriller is left.

Still, the basic story here could be told better on the big screen. I thought the acting for the most part was poor  probably due to a poor script. Ginas character was just not plausible. Emilies character sure recovered from the gunshot wound in a hurry.
I think there are many actors who could do a better job all around. I think the screenplay could be an order of magnitude better.  I think the technology could be far better to create more realistic illusions.

5679329,2,B00BWHAP6Y,"This film was not worth my time, and I'll admit right now, I did not finish watching it. To start with: the music. It's a rip-off of a James Newton Howard score(similar to the Joker's bank heist at the beginning of 'The Dark Knight). The score has zero imagination and does nothing but continue ticking, incessantly, tediously, and without a single inspired note. It just stays on automatic pilot, as though the film-makers knew that no scene could withstand a moment of silence. Next, like most Sy-Fy channel crap, it essentially depicts a single generation (mid twenties to early thirties) -- all eye candy. The secret governmental project leader, the scientist, the sheriff who investigates, the friend at the dinner, all of them... Movies that do not depict society as comprising people of all ages bug me (sure, there were some old people, but usually a befuddled janitor or airport mechanic). Lastly the story. Perhaps a story showed up eventually, but the formulaic plot-line lead me to believe I needn't watch further.

Great visuals effects with the ""Eldrige"" Ship, and since it's a Urban-Military-Historc Legend, it would have been great to include a Nikola Tesla or Einstein into the whole plot, and having Mr. McDowell as the inventor of the process is a must-see!

5679332,3,B00BWHAP6Y,"Back in 1943 Nikola Tesla passed away in obscurity, as designed by J. Pierpoint Morgan.

 Upon his death, Morgan directed his gummit employee pocket puppet, J. Edgar Hoover, to take some of his brainwashed gummit criminal cohorts and raid Tesla's  Manhattan apartment and without legal writs or cause, burglarize Tesla's intellectual proprietaries... consequently that's where the ""Manhattan Project"" came from to destroy the two cities in Japan and grab the title of ""Super Power"" among the nations of this world commencing the nefarious ""Atomic Age""....

 The technology used in this movie was more of Tesla's work in action during the real life Philadelphia Experiment, however this movie was too much ""WhollyWeird"" and actually does nothing to advance the real story about Tesla's work.

 The technologies of Tesla and Einsteins theory of relativity and quantum physics all come together here but the failure of these two great genius's theories to understand and adiquitly explain our galaxies black holes, means they are at best, an approximation to the laws governing the universe around us, but not the final answer to what we as human beings are seeking for free energy..

And I believe thats what they wanted to communicate with each and everyone of us through the written works they, Tesla and Einstein, wished to give to mankind to understand what is really going on around us in the world in which we live...  the Laws of physics that encompass all things about free energy, and what we do not yet understand and therefore cannot ourselves govern

Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors. (Nikola Tesla)

In this movie there was no actual time travel, or I should say there is no scenes that go back to the 1940's where the USS Eldridge originated from in time. Everything is in present day 2012. The special effects on the ship were very low budget compared to the first movie. There were no Navy service men fused in to the ship alive and moving, and more plaster casts painted to match the color of the walls of the ship. Amazon list Malcolm McDowell in the credits, and his character is a little more that just a cameo. Michael Pare' who was in the original 1984 film, and this movie he plays a completely different character. There is no reference to his character from the original film that traveled from the 1940's.

In modern times, a private company contracted to the military recreates the magnetic flux from the first experiment (actually I thought it was radar, but who cares). They managed to make the WWII destroyer appear in Pennsylvania.  Lt. Bill Gardner from 1943 (Nicholas Lea) leaves the ship in 2012...in the same town where he lived. His granddaughter's boyfriend happens to enter the ship and get trapped on it. This coincidence was less believable than the magnetic field which can transport huge objects through space and time. Oh BTW for some poorly explained reason, the government wants Bill dead which leads to ridiculous conflict between people who both want to make the problem go away.

The special effects were CG and at times worse than others. The film incorporates the myth the men were trapped inside metal bulkheads. Bill adjusts to modern times fairly well, something they could of had more fun with, if they hired a comedy writer.
