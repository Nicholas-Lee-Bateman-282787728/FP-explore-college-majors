7902955,5,B000003K92,"The day the Alpha Quadrant knew was coming finally arrives in ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" Episode 112, ""In Purgatory's Shadow"" (Written by Robert Hewitt Wolfe & Ira Steven Behr, Aired February 10, 1997).  DS9 picks up a coded message from the Gamma Quadrant that appears to be in Cardassian, so Garak (Andrew J. Robinson) is asked to analyze it.  He says the message is not important, but then is caught trying to sneak off in a runabout.  When Garak admits that the message is a distress call from his mentor Enabran Tain (Paul Dooley), the former head of the Obsidian Order, Sisko allows the Garak to go to the Gamma Quadrant, but with Worf (Michael Dorn) along to keep an eye on him.  The pair are pretty much at each other's throats the entire trip, until they stumble upon the entire Jem'Hadar fleet.  This can only mean one thing: the invasion of the Alpha Quadrant is about to begin.
Worf sends a warning to DS9, but before he can confirm it went through he and Garak are captured by the Jem'Hadar and sent to a Dominion detention center.  There they meet Martok, the Klingon general who was replaced by a Changeling (""Apocalypse Rising""), Tain, who is irate that Garak was foolish enough to be captured, and a member of the DS9 crew, which means there is a Changeling aboard the station.  Meanwhile, Sisko gets enough of the message to realize what is happening and starts to prepare for the invasion, but the only real option he has is to seal the wormhole, even if Worf and Garak are still on the other side.  To be continued... in ""By Inferno's Light.""
""In Purgatory's Shadow"" gets a lot set up for the first part of this two-part story.  There are several elements that could sustain an entire episode present in this one, especially the encounter between Garak and Tain, so that ups the ante considerably, making for a strong episode that has a nice balance between small moments and large implications.  Of course, given that there is only one way for the Dominion to invade the Alpha Quadrant, I would have to say that the wormhole and Deep Space Nine should already have a couple of Starships patrolling the area, but that would have been the smart thing to do and would have taken away from the big cliff-hanger.  Just be sure that you have both parts before you start watching this one.",1073260800,,2306,4.572815533980583
7902956,5,B000003K92,"Excellent episode. The beginning of what would be the two-year long war between the Federation and the Cardassians/Dominion. Filled with suspense, surprises, twists and turns, shocking developments, and strong tests of courage. Well-written episode and worth every penny to buy. In case you want to know, my most favorite Star Trek episode of all time is the ""Sacrifice of Angels"".",973296000,,381,5.366666666666666
7902957,5,B000003K92,"Worf and Garak go into the gamma quadrant to investigate a cardassian code  whice garak claims was sent by tain the former leader of the obsidian  order. They progress further into the gamma quadrant where they are  captured by gem hadar. Worf is forced to fight the gemhadar while garak  engineers their escape from the dominion prison camp . It is a great  episode which is one of my favorites it shows worfs true test of klingon  honor and spirit.
meanwhile on ds9 doctor bashier was replaced by a  changeling where he is damageing station systems and would be sucessful if  doctor bashier wouldnt have hailed the station from the gamma quadrant.
A  taskforce of klingon ships arrive from cardassian space and gowron agrees  to ally the klingon empire with the federation once again and it is the  beginning of the dominion war saga a must see !!",965347200,,849,4.668918918918919
