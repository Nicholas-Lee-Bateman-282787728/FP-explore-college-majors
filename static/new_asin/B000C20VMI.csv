2452141,1,B000C20VMI,"A teen movie with actors way beyond the teenage years. Two 30 something year old men looking for love in Miami, that behave like they should be in high school. The actors are all decent but none are leads they would all be great character actors and nothing more. The Italian family is a mockery and insulting to Italians. This movie is a waste of time.",1157673600,2,353,4.363636363636363
2452142,1,B000C20VMI,"Ok folks, let's not mince words here.  This film stars Krista Allen, and there's a pretty girl in a thong on the back cover.  Not to mention the lead actress appears on the cover in a string bikini. So what the average viewer expects is a romantic comedy with lots of bounce and jiggle.  However, the flesh factor here is miniscule.

Even though this film is ""unrated,"" it's not because of racy content. This film is a weak ""R"" at the very worst... but the reality is this is a strong PG-13.

You were warned.",1146182400,5,509,4.315789473684211
2452143,3,B000C20VMI,"Like many things in life, this movie is a luxury item. If you have the luxury of time and most of us do, take a moment to watch something that is rare today- a movie made by Hollywood outsiders.  Most pop culture is not a necessity, despite the designers and movie makers touting ""oh this is the most important movie, album, video, sweater set of all time."" This is a fun movie, a couple of friends looking for love in the town voted by ""Allure"" magazine as the worst town for single people to find love. Yes, Miami.  Lots of reasons but it proves that nice people can find love if they try hard enough- endure the mob, barking, vicious dogs, gun play, bumbling idiots, too much pie, and mental and emotional confusion. Most importantly, they don't give up.  Also a nice friendship between two men.  The movie sticks to its message and does not pretend to be something serious, it does not force Pete to mature, there isn't a climatic dnouement when the tone changes. it is meant to fun and it succeeds.  Pete may never mature but he is a good friend and  in love.  So, watch the movie and enjoy. It is a nice movie, won't change your life but few things do. So, like many novels and other films, nice to have-  like a pair of leather pants!",1140480000,7,1241,4.318965517241379
2452144,3,B000C20VMI,"Well, if you're a fan of Krista, Kristin, Chris, or Brad (all of whom are underrated and underworked), you should check out this film because they are all really funny in it.  From Krista's wacky Italian accident, to Chris' equally wacky facial expressions, all four of the primary cast prove they have a knack for physical comedy.  However, the film itself lacks the production value needed to cut it with the rest of Hollywood's standards. For one thing, many of the shots are soft focus-- almost to the point of being just plain blurry-- which I don't believe was intentional: it looks like the Assistant Cameraman missed his mark while pulling focus one too many times. Also, the tone is not consistent throughout: there are moments that are full of lowbrow comedy and then moments that drag and bore as the sort-of-chuckle gets played to death. The lighting is often mismatched and overdone--much like a network three-camera sitcom. The soundtrack is superb, though, with three original hits from Ana Lovelis. This is an independent film at its very core: it was written and produced by two complete newcomers to the film world, and that shows. A nice first time effort, but very much an amateur film. It's almost surprising it brought in the name talent (and DP) that it did.",1140220800,,1281,4.818181818181818

8095226,3,B000C20VMI,"I met one of the film makers on a plane so I checked it out... It held my interest so well I played Tetris the entire movie. That said, I gave it three stars because I feel like they were trying to make a horrible and cheesy film. I can't imagine a plot so horrible otherwise.",1455840000,,276,3.9464285714285716

8095232,5,B000C20VMI,"I actually found this film fun to watch in a campy sorta way. Christoher Daniel Barnes (""The Brady Bunch""/Tv's Starman) does a great job with a silly script. The Mob guys in the film are a lil too much, and I'm actually tired of seeing mob guys in films,they pretty much are played out. Krista Allen is funny in the film too,and there are alot of cameos by 80's actors. When I baught this film, I started watching it, and just kept laughing on Chris's face expressions and the way he acts when he is around his love interest. He is a better actor than the script and other actors in the film, which makes this film watchable. Krista too has her moments. I know I rated it very high, but just felt that some of the other viewers were too harsh. It is a campy fun film, not the best film or the worst....just ok.",1186704000,6,810,4.198717948717949
8095233,1,B000C20VMI,This was the biggest waste of 5 dollars in our life!!! From a bad plot to worse acting the proper title should have been shut up and kill me.,1170115200,,141,3.896551724137931
8095234,2,B000C20VMI,"This had '80s movie written all over it from the very first note of the lead song. It continued and continued and continued. Even the mob guys that they used were over-the-hill mob guys that had some heft (pun perhaps not intended) in the 80s but are slated as b-movie actors now. The leading characters, particularly the two males, are, as one reviewer noted, underworked and underappreciated.

If this had been made two decades ago, it might have reached cult status. Who knows? There are worse movies with such status made back then.

This reviewer lived through the '80s and has no desire to revisit them in the form of a poorly made film. There's a reason for straight-to-DVD releases.",1159142400,,690,4.741666666666666
