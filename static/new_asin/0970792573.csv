I do think the producers were a bit gullible on a couple of points, especially where Doc's grave is concerned, but an excellent Doc-umentary.",1116374400,,274,5.204545454545454
8177680,4,0970792573,"I've seen nearly every Wyatt Earp video on the market and all of them fall far short of the mark.  They cram more than 20 years worth of action into 40 mins.  The result of this is an extremely unsatisfactory account of Wyatt's life with everything including his friend Doc Holliday and the gunfight squeezed and summarized.
This video is a first!  Doc Holliday finally gets his own video.  Not only that but the video takes its time on all the good details of Doc's life, providing photographs that are rarely published and digging into the Colorado archives to provide new information and slants on Doc's life in Colorado.
A must for Docoholics everywhere!",1013212800,5,658,4.745614035087719

8177682,5,0970792573,This is the best (and recently put together) documentary of key events and facts that occured during the war - told by news people and military who were there at the time and played major roles. I thought it was just  outstanding - all 3 tapes. It effectively represented the highs and lows of  the campaign without being 'rambo'. I fully recommend it to anyone who is  interested in seeing the war from a 'news magazine' format.,917049600,2,429,4.545454545454546
