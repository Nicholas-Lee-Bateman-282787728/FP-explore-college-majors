8100670,4,B000CQLZ9W,We can thank Dave Clark for blocking the DVD release of this tribute concert:  He controls the publishing of the DC5 music library...,1336608000,5,133,4.782608695652174
8100671,4,B000CQLZ9W,"I was at the second show of this spectacular event at B.B. King's, and it was a night I shall never forget !! I was ecstatic to hear that the DVD was finally coming out, but lo and behold:  it was ""sold out"" within five minutes and is currently unavailable anywhere !!  I sincerely hope that Critics' Choice will get it back in stock, because I had originally ordered five !!  Chris Czerwinski",1212451200,4,393,4.3561643835616435
8100672,5,B000CQLZ9W,"Thie purpose of this concert was to help Mike Smith of
 The Dave Clark 5 with his mounting medical bills....
This was recorded a few years ago when Mike was still alive.
It is a shame no, rather criminal that the delays in putting this out and getting funds to assist Mike Smith before his death was not done.",1210723200,6,309,4.237288135593221
8100673,5,B000CQLZ9W,"Both shows in tribute to Mike Smith were packed for good reason-Mike deserves the accolades and the lineup of performers was outstanding. Paul Shaffer's musical direction set up an unbeatable format. Each artist performed his best stuff, then covered a DC5 song, memorable for Mike's treatment, but uniquely stamped by these performances. The vocals sizzled and the music was jaw-dropping. Guests on and off stage provided extra interest and turned this evening into a real event. With the power packed celebration lasting until the wee hours of the morning in real time, this compilation has to rank as a must have. Can't comment on the DVD (not released as of this writing), but would recommend it based on the quality and quantity of British Invasion hits covered by the performers. We don't see enough of these performers and we don't hear enough of this g-r-e-a-t music.",1144713600,6,875,5.0
8100674,5,B000CQLZ9W,"I was at the first show. Although I have not seen the DVD YET...it hasn't been released as I type this....I can WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend, no...URGE that you buy it now without a second thought.
For one thing, ANYTHING with Paul Shaffer's stamp of professionalism on it is QUALITY.  Watching Paul's enthusiasm playing and directing with musicians he loved when he was a teen back in Thunder Bay in the 60's is worth the price of admission.
Peter and Gordon, reunited for the first time in 35 years... their harmonies sounding every bit as sweet and melodious... but looking like they've been through a time machine and have morphed into their own grandfathers (!) You can see the love between them when Gordon does a bit of dramatic pause and timing  on True Love Ways singing: "" throughout the days..."" in  deep and sonorous tones...and Peter fairly beams with humor and appreciation.
If you have never heard Will Lee's (the acclaimed bassist who is a regular with Paul on David Letterman's Late Show)baby The Fab Faux ...you are in for some astonishing sounds. Listen to them one time with your eyes closed. They perform live the sounds The Beatles themselves could not recreate out of studio. Again, Will's love and enthusiasm SHINES . He surrounds himself with the best musicians. Fab Faux fans have been anxiously awaiting this release and the opportunity to listen to this group outside  their consistently sold out performances.  Will's wife donated her time and was my waitress for this event.
 Indeed, EVERYONE ( Denny Laine, Billy J. Kramer, Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone of The Zombies, Steely Dan's Donald Fagen )donated their time and talent...because this was done for Mike...MIKE SMITH...one of THE GREATEST ROCK & ROLL WAILERS of all time.  The man with the huge voice behind the organ for The Dave Clark 5. Go ahead...dust off an old DC5 vinyl. Mike's husky wail and raw energy sound every bit as dynamic after 40 + years. Well, Mike has been several years in a wheelchair after a fall at his home in Spain, and this show is all about our gratitude for the part Mike played in laying the soundtrack for our youth.....about thanking him and giving some of that Love back.
 Mike has been through some pretty rough days and months and years...and it kind of felt , in that room, on that night, we had collectively revived the Spirit of that Love and that potential for it's healing Power that we all felt back then was strong enough to change the world. It was summoned to positively impact one man's Life and lift up his Spirit. A man whose gift and energy and raw talent had been an integral part of the soundtrack of our youth.
 All proceeds from the sale of this DVD go to Mike. Currently, money needs to be raised to purchase a specially equipped van  which would facilitate his moving out of hospital where he has been living.
Buy a DVD....nah....buy two !!",1144022400,13,2877,4.690476190476191
