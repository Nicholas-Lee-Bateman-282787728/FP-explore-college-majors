8117579,1,B000F4E34A,I did it once and the fast lunges threw out my right hip flexor. I was in pain for a couple days. I think I'll stick with the 20 minute FIRMs,1357171200,,141,3.5806451612903225
8117580,5,B000F4E34A,"Great Total body workout. Heart pumping cardio mixed with heavy weight training. There is s a lot of lunges and dips in this workout and leg press using the fanny lifter. There is also a couple cardio parts using the 8-10 inch box for aerobics. Other people can use shorter boxes. Heidi Tanner is a very good instructer,she explains things well. There is also a killer part with floor work. The ab section is a real killer,it is a challenge. The leg work s also a killer,especially if you put on ankle weights. Wearing five pound ankle weights or more is a real challenge. Firm Cardio and Firm Strength are paired together to cause altimate muscle confusion. Muscle confusion occurs when changinng the exercise pattern daily. I learned that from the Firms 20 questions about fitness. The 50 minute information program. That is why alternating exercise viseos is best. It makes results in the body appear much faster. That is why the Firm Cross Training videos are really good. I highly insist using this video.",1153785600,,1010,4.777142857142858
