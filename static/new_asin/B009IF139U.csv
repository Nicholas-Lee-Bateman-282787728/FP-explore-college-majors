8541812,4,B009IF139U,"My copy, played on an all-region player, showed the bonus feature about the various versions of LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN to be shown in 4:3 ratio with right and left sections of the picture cut off. The main feature, however, played just fine. I contacted the people who distribute this set in the US and and both they and I tried to get a response from Euroarts but the company refused to respond either to them or to me. It played on my computer and on most DVD players in widescreen but not on others.

This puzzled my contact at the distributors greatly and Euroarts is to be held responsible for its not caring about its products.",1393113600,3,632,4.448275862068965

8541814,4,B009IF139U,"For Offenbach fans ( fanatics ?) this will be an interesting, maybe even welcome DVD.  Two complete one-act operettes-bouffes are presented in a rather odd framework:  ""Les deux aveugles"" and ""Croquefer, le dernier des paladins"". The stagings are amusing, if a bit confusing.  Both are presented in all black-and-white productions, sets, costumes, makeup, which are eye-catching, if a bit odd. It's the framework which is particularly strange: we are supposed to be watching these comedies as performed in Offenbach's own lifetime, and experiencing the varied reactions of his audience: scandalized and offended by high-class politicians and functionaries, and received with hilarity by the middle-class  audience in the upper tiers of the theatre.  I have a hard time understanding all the jokes and references, resulting in some confusion and perplexity.
As for the two pieces, "" Aveugles"" is charming enough, but ""Croqufer"" is a real delight.  Toe-tapping tunes in frenetic rhythms and parodies of Meyerbeer and Halevy abound.  Both are well-sung by British and Hungarian singers.  The operettas are sung in French, the framework is dubbed in English, or a choice of other languages.
As a bonus, there is an almost hour-long documentary on the various versions of ""Tales of Hoffmann"" and their development.  This is fascinating, although it tends to give me a headache !  Only a suggestion of the tumultuous contraversy surrounding this subject is conveyed.",1358294400,6,1460,5.392070484581498
