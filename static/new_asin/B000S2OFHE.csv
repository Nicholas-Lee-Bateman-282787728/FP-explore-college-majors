8204099,5,B000S2OFHE,I enjoyed.,1442966400,,10,4.5
8204100,5,B000S2OFHE,"Personally, I believe David Barton's DVDs should be mandated viewing in all schools in the US.
I had the VHS tape from several years ago, and instead of trying to show it in VHS format, or
paying to have it put on a DVD, the price was ridiculous low enough to simply buy the DVD.
Every patriotic American needs to view this film - and show it to those liberals who are trying
to destroy what made this country great. Thank you David Barton ... Thank you Amazon.",1407024000,,461,4.25
8204101,1,B000S2OFHE,I just can't take David Barton serious.  He has a history of making up history and here he does it again.,1362355200,,105,4.0
8204102,1,B000S2OFHE,"While it was my fault for not reading the description in full, this ""documentary"" is right-winged hogwash. I had planned to show it in my undergraduate-level education class, but I decided to spare them after watching about four minutes of the film. Save your money. Read a book.",1353715200,,279,4.833333333333333
8204103,1,B000S2OFHE,"Sorry Folks, David Barton is the most dangerous type of historian - one with absolutely no training in history whose intention is to advocate for his warped view of American history rather than performing any honest scholarship.  Far from it, Barton wouldn't know a fact if it hit him in the face, especially if it differed from his predetermined confusions.

Barton's claims about possessing historical documents are ridiculous.  1) How did he obtain these ""documents?""  2) How does he know they are authentic?  2) Has he had them verified by any legitimate scholars?  3) Where are they?  (If he actually had ""documents"" this important, they belong in a public museum where others can see them since, after all, they belong to all Americans, not just him.)  4) Since we have to take Barton's word about what they contain, how do we know he's telling the ""truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  (Putting these ""documents"" on public display would silence critics like me and refute the contrary claims of mainstream Historians.)

Barton expects us to believe that every Founding Father and every man (except Jefferson and Madison) who helped draft our Constitution was a ""born-again, fundamentalist, conservative Christian just like himself and his intended audience.  Barton also wants you to believe that every one of these men was educated at a Christian college and trained to be a minister.  Even the slightest honest investigation of the facts would prove him wrong.  Barton makes much of some of the founders' associations with Witherspoon without telling you anything about that man's theology.  I leave it to you to ""Google"" Witherspoon and find the truth yourself.

Barton provides quote after quote from early American leaders that supposedly support his specious, and false conclusion that they meant for America to be a ""Christian Nation.""  What he, and his adoring, gullible, credulous fans fail to realize is that every quote they cite only serves to prove they are wrong.  All anyone has to do is actually read our great Constitution and see that none of those quotes or sentiments made it into the document itself.  This begs the question: ""Why not?""  Even though such attempts were made, they were defeated.  Even Franklin's request for prayers led by a minister, much touted by Barton and his followers, were ignored.  The simple common-sense answer to that question: the Founders and the Delegates to the Constitutional Convention set aside all that theology and created a Godless, Secular document, one that begins with the phrase, ""We the People... ""  Clearly, Barton is wrong and this is why he should be taken with several truckloads of salt.  BTW, no one has ever successfully refuted my conclusion.  If you'd like to try, go for it!  All you have to do is show me any indication of ""Christian Nation"" status in the Constitution itself and you win.

(BTW, before you start demonizing me and my beliefs, you should re-read my post and notice that I never made any anti-Christian statements.  My quarrel is with David Barton and those who believe what he says, no questions asked, not with Jesus.)",1325808000,,3131,4.982658959537572
8204104,5,B000S2OFHE,"David Barton does it again! This DVD, ""Education And The Founding Fathers"" is a ""must have"" for anyone serious about our early American history. You won't learn these factual truths from the revisionist history books at school! We've been lied to! I've made certain all the children in my life have watched this wonderful DVD. Thanks David for your hard work... you're the best!",1315526400,5,378,4.921875
8204105,5,B000S2OFHE,"Harvard, Yale and Princeton our 3 oldest and most prestigious Universities were all founded by Christian Clergy for the purpose of educating American youth with the Bible as it's foundation. David Barton is a human encyclopedia on the founding period of this country,  specifically the role of christian education and it's influence on this country. Most Americans neither know any of these facts nor have been exposed to the documents that illustrate this. The reintroduction of these founding truths would change the culture we live today, and give renewed hope for the generations to come. This material should be a part of every school's curriculum.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-England-Primer-Improved-for-the-More-Easy-Attaining-the-True-Reading-of-English-To-Which-Is-Added-the-Assembly-of-Divines-and-Mr-Cotton-s-Catechism/dp/092527917X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New England Primer: Improved for the More Easy Attaining the True Reading of English : To Which Is Added the Assembly of Divines, and Mr. Cotton's Catechism</a>",1196380800,15,1082,7.074626865671642
