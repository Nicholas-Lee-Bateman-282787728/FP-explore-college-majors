8604132,5,B00ED2SHN8,"It is hard to overstate the excellence of this production. The publisher's description is accurate, but it is in the execution that this project shines. Every rhythm is broken down, separately, into parts for gan, pi & l&eacute;, and rum. They are played both with and without a metronome accompaniment. Several camera angles are alternated so you can see exactly how the musician is moving his hands. The whole ensemble is shown with and without 4-way split screen. Every visual is in focus and well lit. Every audio track is clear. Each clip has a title so you know what you're about to see, and every gan part is documented with simple animated notation that anyone can follow (e.g. x - - x - - x - - - x - x - - - ). The menus are detailed, so you can easily select a clip for later review (or just admire the wealth of content in the DVD). There is an interview (including hardcoded English subtitles) with musical director Bira Reis at the end, briefly discussing the history of Candombl&eacute; and explaining the typical agenda for a candombl&eacute; ceremony, including the coordinating roles of the rum player and the dancers. Everything a novice needs to begin serious study of candombl&eacute; percussion is here.

So what's missing? Nothing that would fit into this package. Reis's description of the interaction between the rum and the dancers in trance is tantalizing. This is the heart of the ceremony (in my limited understanding), and watching this kind of performance is mesmerizing. I wish for a similarly outstanding film on that advanced topic.",1492560000,,1566,4.8
