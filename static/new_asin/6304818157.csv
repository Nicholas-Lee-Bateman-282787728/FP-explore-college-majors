929869,2,6304818157,"I bought this video for my wife because she is so interested in Tudor history. Although this is a documentary shown on the History Channel, the production seems very amateurish. There are also ads (for the History Channel) at the beginning of each video, something we found very annoying, although we could just fast-forward thru them. It's just that when we buy a video, we didn't expect ads. We have the video of ""Elizabeth R"" the drama starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth, and that will always be the best historical video of Elizabeth Tudor, in our opinion.",1042243200,2,562,4.804123711340206
929870,5,6304818157,"This History Channel four part documentary on the life of the famous Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I is an excellent addition to any history enthusiast's video library.  Combining commentary with well-done re-enactments, this mini-series chronicles the rise and reign of the most famous queen in history, Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.  This series follows her life from her childhood, where she was raised as a lady in a man's world, tossed about after the death of her father, to whom she was devoted, and ultimately spending her adolescence trying to fend off the advances of her step-father.  After suffering through the reign on her virulently Catholic half-sister, ""Bloody"" Mary, Elizabeth finally ascends to the throne of England in time to fend off conspiracies, rebellions, and marriage proposals.  We then follow as Elizabeth grows into a powerful and intelligent queen, first by putting down a rebellion instigated by Mary, Queen of Scots, then outmanuevering Spain's Phillip II and defeating his great Armada in the English Channel.  Elizabeth's life is a fascinating and entertaining piece of history and this wonderful DVD series does it great justice.  Highly recommended.",1025481600,157,1212,5.352631578947369
929871,2,6304818157,"The video was fun to look back at history, and see some long lost scenes. The coronation was exciting, but the quality was very poor. There was no congurency to the film. Just short little vignetts, and most very short. The sound track is difficul to hear, and at times very muffled. The engineers should have digitalized this to improve the sub-standard quality so that it could be more clear. It is very much like looking at a 1950's television set movie. I enjoyed the video from the standpoint of my facination with the Royal Family, but would have rather checked it out at the library, than to spend more than [price] I spend for tax and delivery. The title on the cover is in error. In several places, the title is listed ad King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth I. A fatal error on the publishers fault. I thought everyone who knows anythig about history, or religon knows that the Queen Mother was not Queen Elizabeth I. That title went to Henry VIII's daughter. The one who finalized the reformation from the Roman Catholic church. Sloppy job.",998870400,3,1050,4.590425531914893
929872,1,6304818157,"This VHS tape does a good job of explaining the history of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the Elisabeth Islands. From that end it is interesting. However the video and audio quality of the tape are terrible.  Sound fluctuates as the interview process changes. There is very little  video of the islands, with most of the video ""talking heads"" of  the people being interviewed. I purchased it prior to a vacation there,  hoping for more scenery and insight. I would not purchase it again.",964483200,8,489,4.855421686746988
929973,5,6304818157,"When it comes to documenting the life and times of The Tudors, there is no better historian than David Starkey.

929976,5,6304818157,"If you're looking for a ""non movie"" type product on the History of Queen Elizabeth I - this is it.  Actually, it's a combination of both because there are character actors appearing as the narrator discusses different events.  Beautifully filmed and narrated - I learned a lot that wasn't mentioned, discussed or shown in the movies made on Elizabeth over the years. You'll have to watch it several times to catch all the details. Thumbs Up!",1308268800,,441,4.7894736842105265
929977,5,6304818157,"I truly enjoyed this 2 disc set and the wonderful portrayal of this amazing time in history. Coupling the facts with the places they occurred made for wonderful viewing combination in this series. The actors didn't really speak but still added drama to the scenes being discussed. The saga opens with the young Princess Elizabeth just after her mother was executed and carries the viewer through the trials and tribulations of her life. They do a great job of portraying the difficult life, triumphs and failures of this enigmatic monarch. For fans of Elizabeth I, deffinately a nice addition to your collection.",1289347200,2,612,5.009803921568627

Now I'm learning about the children of Henry and Elizabeth: The Acclaimed Saga of England's Virgin Queen is a fantastic watch. The amount of information isn't overwhelming or underwhelming. I like that this isn't full of nonsense and wild untrue stories...I know some would consider it a bit boring, but I loved it.

930040,5,6304818157,"I am an ardent fan and avid reader of anything about ""Gloriana"". I am also a high school teacher and am always looking for something new and of quality to use in class. I have read Dr. Starkey's book ""The Young Elizabeth"" prior to viewing the video. This is not a movie version of the life of Elziabeth but a quality documentary. Dr. Starkey's presentation is well atriculated and intense. You get the feeling that he also shares a passion for the life of this most august queen of England. The settings present Elizabeth in an amlost mystical light making her seem ""otherworldly."" This is set against Dr. Starkey's passionate presentation.

I would highly recommend this video not just as a taecher for it's insightful and qualitative academic value, but also as another piece of the puzzle in learing about the life of the most long lived and reigning monarch of the Renaissannce. Did you know Sir Walter Ralegh named Virignia after her as she was also known as ""The Virgin Queen?"" See the documentary to learn more.",1268784000,4,1018,4.719101123595506
930041,3,6304818157,"Brit telly-don David Starkey has the bit firmly between his teeth.  There is no ambiguity here, no sense of the great debates that have raged over all aspects of Elizabeth's life.  Starkey -- he used to be a real academic -- gives his opinions as unquestioned facts:  Elizabeth was sexually abused;  Elizabeth decided to remain a virgin while still in her teens and after reading patristic celebrations of celibacy;  Elizabeth didn't sleep with Robin Dudley but she truly loved the Frog.

OK, I know that nuance isn't Channel 4's thing, but this is shockingly homogenized, rather like ice cream -- soft and sweet.  Would I have been less offended by an actual television presenter with these opinions?  Yes.  Starkey's academic past gives him an authority that -- at least in this case -- is too easy to accept.

Those of us who have watched Starkey for years, whether in BBC doc.os or at conferences, will remember a slightly scruffy chap with elbow patches and rumpled hair.  No more:  he is transformed by a splendid suiting, heavy make-up, and sterling-silvered smoothness into someone with whom none would dare demure.  And -- don't get me wrong -- he does get off some great lines.  My favorite is his statement that Pope ""signed a fatwah"" on Elizabeth.  The shock value actually works there.  On the other hand, saying that Elizabeth loathed war because she couldn't lead her own armies and had to trust them to men to lead them is willfully simplistic.

There are many reasons why Elizabeth dreaded war, and that's hardly the most significant.

There are other academics on the stage from time to time, but they appear uncredited and they all agree with Starkey.

The background music is effective and the production values are quite high.  ""Biography"" fans will see none of those tatty Halloween costumes and bad wigs here;  it's not Merchant Ivory time, but things look pretty good -- both pretty and good.

Thucydides claims that historians give us unvarnished truth; he would be very proud of his great-great-grandson David.  (Unless, of course, Thucydides had become a Papist. . . )",1247443200,15,2095,4.872521246458923
930042,5,6304818157,"Being a devoted student of the history of Tudor England, I could not pass up this DVD set when I saw it in a catalog. Having been very impressed by David Starkey's book and DVD set on the six wives of Henry VIII, I knew this set devoted to Henry's daughter Elizabeth would be equally fascinating. This set brings over three hours of documentary on two DVDs about the life of Elizabeth I, including on-location narration where parts of Elizabeth's life took place, and also re-enactments in historical dress. The documentary comes in four episodes dealing with Elizabeth's life before her accession to the Throne, her early reign, the political and religious turmoil of the 1570s and 80s culminating in the attack of the Spanish Armada, and the final phase of Elizabeth's reign.

If you have read a lot about Elizabeth, this set will probably not teach you a whole lot but is still very worth seeing to give one a clearer mental picture of what things were like in Elizabeth's time. In my case, I had read some but not a great deal about Elizabeth's reign and I found this set an entertaining and informative way to enhance my knowledge and understanding of late Tudor England. I would recommend this to anyone who shares my love of English history and historical documentaries!",1245024000,5,1277,4.726457399103139
930043,5,6304818157,"I really am a fan of David Starkey, who is one of premiere historians on the Tudor era, so it's no surprise I love this documentary. It is in two parts, with David Starkey narrating it. This documentary is not boring and it uses actors/actresses to act out various points. Of course this should not be taken as a be all end all discussion on Queen Elizabeth but it offers great insight and historical knowledge of the great Queen. If you like Tudor history, or just are interested about learning more about Queen Elizabeth, then I highly suggest you check this out. It is also has great replayability. I have watched it a dozen times.",1228780800,7,634,4.521739130434782
930044,2,6304818157,"There is no doubt that David Starkey is a wonderful historian and his books are great, but he does not do well on screen.  There is an almost disturbing look that comes over him whenever he says the word ""sexual"" which he seems to attribute as being Elizabeth's main characteristic.  Not very well presented and rather dull interpretation of a the most vivid and colorful period in history.",1201046400,10,390,4.720588235294118
930045,4,6304818157,"Elizabeth, a two-DVD set by The History Channel, will win the hearts and minds of a wide audience.  On-location photography in the United Kingdom and Ireland, well-done reenactments, artwork, and the superb narration of historian David Starkey make it possible for viewers to get a better appreciation for Queen Elizabeth I and the impact of her reign on British, European, and world history.  Starkey clearly explains how Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, managed to become queen in 1558 C.E. through courage, cunning, and luck.  Starkey also shows with conviction that unlike her cousin Mary Stewart, Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, a Protestant, was an astute politician both domestically and overseas during her nearly 45-year rule.  England became a major European power under Elizabeth I's reign.  Paradoxically, Mary Stewart, the figurehead of Catholicism, got the last word after her execution for high treason against Elizabeth I in 1587 C.E.  Elizabeth I died heirless in 1603 C.E.  Mary Stewart's son, James VI of Scotland, became King of England and Scotland as James I after the death of Elizabeth I.  To summarize, Elizabeth is a nice addition to the DVD library of any person fond of history.",1185753600,28,1232,5.155778894472362

David Starkey does a excellent job as always in bring this wonderful Queen of England in the 16th Century to life.

You get to see and hear the Straggles that Elizabeth went through in order to gain the crown.

The actors used in the documentary all do the production justice.

I would Recommend this DVD to anyone who loves history or/and want to learn more about Tutor England.

The DVD itself is of a high Quality. Clear sharp pictures and sound. Well worth the price.",1177286400,10,603,4.348214285714286
930047,5,6304818157,"This is a really beautiful documentary about the life of Elizabeth.  It is not a drama, uses actors primarily without words under narration to tell the life story of Elizabeth.  I have watched this several times over.

Similar to other David Starkey narrated histories, there are trace comments which really SHOULD be followed up on, things stated as fact that would be hard to prove outside of conjecture.  Some of today's pasty titled folks are trotted out and one wonders how much of an authority they really are, when they mistranslate simple phrases... but that also brings life and light to the ""mystique"" of station, to see that these really are just people.

The actors are well used, and when they do get to speak, they shine.  I especially like that they used two actresses, one for young Elizabeth, another for older.  The transition is done well, and helps the time-line progress (they should have done the same thing with Mary).

Not the best docu-history I've ever seen, but very basic, well produced, and worth several viewings.",1158105600,55,1043,4.853107344632768

I purchased this title because Netflix made disc 2 available, but not disc 1.  I called and explained to an operator the situation, but could not get him or Netflix to understand, so they never fixed the problem.  It hasn't been the only time, either.

Anything dealing with English/British history by David Starkey is worth seeing, in my opinion.  Dr. Starkey delivers a powerful story in installments that are extremely well explained, logically presented and even humorous at times.  I'd like to add that I was already immersed in English monarchy when I watched this.  Incidentally, I had watched Dr. Starkey's 'Monarchy' series.",1463788800,4,831,5.051470588235294

7877709,5,6304818157,"A really consummate and  compelling journey with David Starkey charting the amazing life of one of England's greatest monarchs. Starkey in this exciting documentary complete with Starkey's penetrating presentation, historic locations and wonderful dramatic presentations begins with Elizabeth I's  birth and her perilous childhood as well as her skill since early childhood at speech and diplomacy.

We observe the continued danger during the reigns of her brother Edward VI, and particularly her sister Mary I (Bloody Mary) , times in which she came under suspicion of being involved in treasonous plots and was closely watched and kept in semi-captivity.
We observe how she was sexually abused by her stepfather Thomas Seymour, and the resultant interrogations  she suffered. this documentary also demonstrates how close she came to the scaffold during her sister Mary's reign.

It is an account of how in 45 years she took England from being a weak,impoverished and divided country and with the able assistance of her chief  minister William Cecil she overcame all her difficulties making a religious settlement some way towards satisfying both Protestants and Catholics and fending off England's enemies, particularly Spain and France while building up England into a formidable power and building up that country's navy.

Starkey does not spare her criticism and shows her negative qualities of cunning and the ruthlessness which she put down the he Rising of the North of 1569. Good focus on Mary Queen of Scots (played by the very pretty Sana Montague) but strangely enough while Elizabeth (Karen Archer) is shown as ageing , the recreation of Mary at her trial 20 years after her captivity at Fotheringham shows her as young and beautiful as the early footage of Seana as Mary.

Starkey explains how Mary was trapped by the cunning Francis Walsingham into agreeing to a plot against Elizabeth, and the reluctance with which Elizabeth agreed to execute Mary. She also seemed to be greatly remorseful after she signed Mary's death warrant, but Starkey seems to think some of her anguish was crocodile tears.

Powerful footage of England's dramatic victory over the invading Spanish Armada in 1588. Very interesting here is how we see firstly how unpopular Elizabeth was towards the end of her reign and how close Robert Devereaux, erstwhile favourite of elizabeth came to deposing her in his attempted coup de tat.

 Also great portrayal of Elizabeth's stubborn refusal to take to bead in her last days. At a time when English history is being downscaled in schools and universities in order not to offend certain groups, the English children and young people are being robbed of a central part of their heritage and identity. Series like these are welcome and refreshing.",1375228800,2,2778,5.178571428571429
