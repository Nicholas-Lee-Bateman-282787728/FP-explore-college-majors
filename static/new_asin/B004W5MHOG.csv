4485339,5,B004W5MHOG,"A sincere, cathartic, jagged little pill that offers a certain something; a form of closure akin to This Boy's Life or Good Will Hunting.

 Our witty, quippy and sharp-tongued, yet plausibly average star navigates a palpable mid-70's Brooklyn.  From an under-privileged neighborhood, Brian's social group fails to understand that college could be anything but an excuse not to get a job.  Brian is torn between art and the criminal proclivities of his manipulative and abused older brother, Danny.  He may be from a rough neighborhood, but he's a sweet, boyish twenty-or-so with an aw-shucks smile and Elijah Wood's innocence.  Hearing the newfound insights of a friend, Brian begins to dream that college could be his way out of this world which he undeniably uses to temper his self-worth.

 Stephen Lang (Avatar, TV's Terra Nova) performs excellently as the callous, abusive father.  Karen Allen brilliantly plays his overworked wife whose Herculean efforts fail to hold the family together as she casts a blind eye to her husband's actions.  Most interactions with the parents are difficult, but there are some soothingly endearing moments like recurring teasing about mom's cooking and nearly forgotten memories of how dad was before he got like this.

Drawing our attention is Brian's artwork.  The director carefully utilized this pathway to steer the plot, educe mood and engage undertones about Brian's fragile relationships with the small world he knew, his crumbling family, and his own self doubt.",1319155200,5,1509,5.2677824267782425
4485340,4,B004W5MHOG,"Growing up blue-collar Irish-American in the NYC area, I can relate to this film in almost every sense. From the bar scenes to the dreadful moment the 'old man' comes home from Clancy's Pub, this is an Irish story with the American flag draped around it.
  The film revolves around two brothers growing up in 1970s Brooklyn. One's a small-time thief while the other is an aspiring artist just trying to spread his wings and fly out of the city for good. Along the way - romance, violence, temptation, and tragedy strike up until the superb and much-talked-about final scene.
  Pour yourself a pint of Guinness and enjoy. This very well made and well acted NY drama will hit very close to home for New Yorkers and Irish viewers especially. Slainte!

4 stars.",1316649600,17,757,4.661654135338346
4485341,5,B004W5MHOG,"Was lucky enough to see this film in NYC at a film festival. The performances, especially those by Stephan Lang and Karen Allen, are very powerful. Beautifully filmed and deeply moving.",1312502400,4,185,5.0
4485342,5,B004W5MHOG,"I grew up right there at the time(5 blocks away).  These characters were bits and pieces of so many families (including my own) I knew growing up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.  There were so many little details (props, furniture, scenery, etc.) in the background that seemed so exact.  I felt like I was watching 8mm home movies.  The actors really picked up the accent and attitude.  It's as if I knew them. It seems as though everytime they make a movie about Brooklyn, something horrible happens at the end.  The conflict and climax are considered critical to good storytelling (here it was predictable), but character development with good acting and strong dialogue can (in my opinion) compensate for a predicable and week plot.  If anyone wants to experience Bay Ridge, Brooklyn before Disco and John Travolta made it cliche, watch this incredible film.  I had many Brooklynites I know on Facebook check it out and they ALL agree.  It is the working class Brooklyn of 1975 were alcoholism and brutishness was so common it seemed normal.  We are all in there somewhere looking to get out.",1312156800,5,1087,4.795698924731183
4485343,4,B004W5MHOG,"Having grown up in Brooklyn in the '70's in an Irish-American household, I found so much to appreciate in this movie; the sights and scenery, the music, the clothes, the relationships, but it also had a timeless quality to it in both the story and the characters. Brian's story of wanting to escape from cycle of working hard for little reward is always appealing, but the richness of the supporting players really made this movie one of my new ""favorites"". It was quite poignant, but with some good laughs thrown in.

Of special note, Karen Allen, as Brian's mother, was hauntingly beautiful. At times you pity her, at times you question her, and at times you applaud her strength. She delivered an amazing performance.",1311465600,8,720,4.806451612903226
4485344,5,B004W5MHOG,"This is a movie worth seeing.  It takes you into the world of Brooklyn in the 1970's.  You are introduced to two brothers who are in the middle of robbing a jewelry store.  However, as the story develops we see that they are not both on the path to prison.  The younger brother, played by a dynamic young actor, Nick Thurston turns out to be an amazing artist who keeps his talent a secret from his friends and family.  The casting of Stephen Lang as his abusive, alcoholic Father and Karen Allen as the submissive and quietly suffering Mother is brilliant.  There are enough good action scenes to keep your blood pumping along with a very sexy love scene in the artist's studio with the beauty Leslie Murphy.  The sound and music are nicely done.  The Director, John Gray, told this story from the heart and you feel every frame.  Two thumbs up.",1310947200,2,846,4.477124183006536
4485345,5,B004W5MHOG,"This film blew me away with it's impeccable filmography and acting. For an independent film with a $600,000 budget I think it does amazingly well as passing for a film with a much higher budget, and much more seasoned actors.

Avatar's Stephen Lang leads a cast of amazing actors who wonderfully create joy, laughter, suspense and even tears. Some of this is attributed to John Gray, as his talent can be seen in CBS's Ghost Whisperer with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

This is a riveting film and definitely one of my top tens. I agree wholeheartedly with the guy who said it is made stronger by the ending.

I didn't grow up in 1970's Brooklyn but I relate to this film just because some of the settings take you back to a different time and give you a feeling of nostalgia that we can all appreciate. For instance, the notion of it being ridiculous to want to work with computers.",1310947200,14,876,4.49685534591195
4485346,5,B004W5MHOG,"I've now seen this movie several times.  It is inspiring, suspenseful, funny, and the acting is amazing.  Stephen Lang deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of an abusive alcoholic father and there are some great performances by up and coming younger actors.  This film has one of the better surprise endings I've ever seen and the overall feeling you're left with is one of hope, redemption, and possibility.  Definitely take the time to check this one out!",1310515200,18,456,4.883116883116883
4485347,5,B004W5MHOG,"I was lucky enough to catch a screening of ""White Irish Drinkers"" not too long ago and was blown away with the cast and story. In deference to the title, there's not a lot of drinking in this film (wish they had left out the smoking, though) and the acting is terrific from all the cast.

I'll watch Peter Riegert in anything and Stephen Lang is a bit scary at the abusive father. But Nick Thurston gives the real standout performance not to be missed.

I recommend White Irish Drinkers for older teens and adult audiences.",1310256000,4,523,4.4375
4485348,3,B004W5MHOG,"""I wish I could be like you...no matter how hard I try I'm never gonna be like you...and your always gonna hate me for that.""  Brian (Thurston) and his brother Danny are looking for a way out of Brooklyn.  Brian's ambition is to become and artist and go to school.  Danny is a tough guy who thinks the best way is to rob and steal until he has enough to leave with.  After the Rolling Stones are booked for one night only at the theater where Brian works they think they have found a way to get the money they need to leave.  This is the kind of movie that is made better by the ending.  While the movie is pretty good all the way through, the acting is good enough and the plot is engaging to keep you watching.  The only problem is that the whole time you feel like there is something missing that would make this movie better.  Then the last 20 min you find out what it is.  This movie is good, but the ending will knock you on your ass and make you glad you continued to watch.  Overall, pretty slow moving in parts, but stay till the end and you will be glad you did.  A very good one time watch.  Because of how powerful the ending was...I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would

4485349,4,B004W5MHOG,"I like how a lot of the style and terminology in the movie is derrived from inner-city life and slang. It's pretty much the same as the movie Black Irish in it's storyline, but I'm a fan of anything Irish so I liked this film. It never got big exposure and I'm guessing the budget was too high, but the acting is for the most part believable, and the closure of the film is good. It's difficult not to be biased on film reviews, and I hate giving away any parts of the film, but it's only available on DVD (no Blu Ray) so it's cheap. If you decide to take a chance on it, you won't be spending a whole lot of money.",1394236800,,615,3.967741935483871
4485350,4,B004W5MHOG,"So is the chant of these Brooklyn buddies circa 1975. They're Irish blue collar and proud of it.

Here's the scoop. Brian and Danny Leary are brothers. Brian is a budding artist but keeps his works under wraps. Danny is a tough and will probably end up in the joint. Their dad (the now ubiquitous Stephen Lang) is a tough, drunk, brute of a man. Mom (Karen Allen) is trying to hold things together but it's a losing battle. The problem is, the neighborhood is what it is and few have any aspirations of doing better for themselves. Danny hatches a scheme to rip off the local theatre owner (Peter Riegert) during a one night only Rolling Stones concert. Things don't go well.

This is mostly a slice of lifer kind of flick. You meet the family and the friends of Brian and Danny. They figure low-level public service (garbage man or train operator) is the way to go. No disco. No drugs. Just hang at the bar and drink away their paychecks. Brian might find a way out through his art and entertains the thought even more so when a local girl with whom he flirts gets an opportunity to move to L.A. working for a travel agency. The writing and performances are good which is what helps make this film work. It was fun seeing Karen Allen. She's now too old to be cute so she gets to settle in and play her character which she does well. Stephen Lang has a long career, but I first remember seeing him in ""Avatar,"" and now he's getting some higher profile roles. He plays the drunk, Irish brute quite well and does a nice turn near the end. The boys are both good. Brian particularly has great camera face and he handles his role well. There are a few clunky scenes as the climax approaches, but that turned out to be a surprise so I'll give those a pass. About the only thing I didn't like was the music. It was mostly blues based rock but it was generic. Not one tune stood out with any authority.

The four stars I gave it might be a bit generous but only a bit. This is a heck of a watch for anyone into this sort of thing.",1379980800,2,2023,4.2357512953367875
4485351,2,B004W5MHOG,"Budget was obiviously extremely limited - I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews - just finished watching it and it was 'ok' at best.  Lot of boring parts.  Definitely a 'rental' and even then, it's a 2 star movie.",1362268800,,212,4.146341463414634

4485353,3,B004W5MHOG,"White Irish Drinkers is a coming of age story, centered around a boy who doesn't quite fit in with the rest of his dysfunctional family. It's a common theme in many similar films and to be honest, I didn't see anything here, that made this movie stand out from the rest of them. This is just another coming of age film without many surprises. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The acting was OK, as was the pace of the film. I'm finding it really difficult to say anything positive or negative about White Irish Drinkers, because the truth is, it's just a simple, ordinary story that I've seen a hundred times before. The names and places always change, and there was a familiar face or two, but nothing about this film stands out positively or negatively in any way. It's just a very common type of story with a very ordinary cast. Everyone does their job and the story gets told, I don't know what you'll think, but my reaction to this film was simple neutrality. A decent movie, but easily forgotten, as nothing made any kind of impact on me at all.",1361491200,,1072,4.446700507614213

4485356,5,B004W5MHOG,"I thought that this might be one of those films where the stereotypes are the whole basis for the movie and to some extent I was right. However it is actually a really well observed film and had me gripped through out. Like the main character here Brian (Nick Thurston) I am a first generation Irish man and so much of the back plot rang true for me. Brian is the younger of two brothers, the elder brother Danny played by Geoffrey Wigdor (`Sleepers') is the Black Sheep and has just come out of prison, he is a cheap street hustler and would be thief. Brian is the thoughtful one who wants to work at the local cinema/rock venue and paint his pictures of urban street life in the shared basement.

Brian has a circle of friends who range from being a proud garbage collector, to a computer pioneer, the only thing they still have in common is their heritage, hatred of disco, love of alcohol and the fact they are white Irish drinkers and they bring some welcome humour to the proceedings.

They have a loving, hard working mother and a hard working, violent, drunken and abusive father. Violence is never far away from the surface when he is around and especially so when he has a skin full, which is pretty much most of the time - a situation I can empathise with. While Brian tries to find love and meaning in his life, Danny seeks only to steal and get away from Brooklyn and a life of being a punch bag, forever. The thing is he loves his brother despite their differences and wants/needs him to get what he wants. Things can only go wrong, but the thing is for who and how ruddy bad?

I really loved this film, it was gritty and dirty and had lots of unnecessary violence, but it struck a nerve with me that meant I could associate with Brian and his hopes and losses. The music is very good too and was done by Mark Snow. It is set in 1975 and the period detail looks quite authentic, they could have made more of the hair do's though and flares but not to worry. A film full of stereotypes that manages to present them in a real and human way and does not pull its punches.",1340841600,2,2082,4.265822784810126

Awesome story, really well acted (Stephen Lang should get a BSA Oscar), funny, moving (the guy next to me in the theater was crying), and amazing ending.  One of the songs off the soundtrack (the Shillaly Brothers' ""Pop"") is up for Best Original Song Oscar nomination.  I really don't have much bad to say about this film.

8444506,5,B004W5MHOG,"This is one of those movies that I loved the first time I watched it and then grew to appreciate even more every time I have watched it again. It's chief merits are the writing and the acting, though of course some the credit for both goes to John Gray, the writer/director. He has given us a diverse collection of characters who are complex and engaging, and the acting is uniformly superb.

The plot is also great, with both unexpected twists and some classic elements of the coming-of-age story. There's a Cain-and-Abel struggle between brothers with starkly different personalities who alternately love, hate, and envy each other. There's the young person's search for his (or her) true calling, with the wrenching decision of whether to cravenly accept the role they think society expects them to follow or to strike out into the unknown. And there's the boy-meets-girl element, though this plot thread takes some unusual twists and offers some of the film's greatest scenes. Watch for the scene where Brian starts idly running his finger over a steamed-up pub window, and watch for the first graveyard scene--I'll say no more for fears of spoiling both gems.

On my second and third viewings, I started to really appreciate the great acting (and writing) that went into depicting the brothers' parents, too. You expect to hate the boozing, brawling, wife-battering father, but it isn't that kind of movie. You expect to pity and maybe despise the down-trodden mother, but it isn't that kind of movie, either. Just watch this film, that's all I can say, and then watch it a few more times until you realize this is a truly great film.

I know this will sound like heresy to some, but I think it deserves to be ranked up there with On the Waterfront--and the more recent Winter's Bone and Frozen River--in its depiction of the American working class struggles and aspirations. I hope John Gray will give us some more like this.",1429747200,,1931,4.8102409638554215

8444509,2,B004W5MHOG,"At the outset of this film I was eager to see how it would play out and perhaps reflect the ethos of mid-1970s Brooklyn Irish-American culture, at least among an element of the folks.  While obviously not a documentary film, I was still eager to get a sense of the time and place.  By the end of the film, especially where the son refuses his father's goodwill gesture of a farewell handshake, I just gave up.  As a graduate of UCLA film school (1980) and as one who has studied and written about Irish and Irish-American film, I wondered how the filmmaker/s could end on such a dreadful note.  Not only that, but I had recently viewed ""Black Irish"" (2008), and I wondered if a plot outline for ""White Irish Drinkers"" (2010) had been grabbed from an encyclopedia book shelf (or a database?) and reworked around the good son/bad son theme.",1428105600,,838,4.529801324503311
