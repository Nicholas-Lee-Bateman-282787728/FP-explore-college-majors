8328060,1,B001NXC010,"This was terrible.  I tried to use it for a ballet workout and could barely follow the poor quality and the dancers, who were not following the routines accurately...nor did they stay together.  The video cut in the middle of exercises to different angles, too.  I couldn't get beyond the barre exercises before I had to turn it off in complete frustration.  There are better ones available.",1355875200,,391,4.791044776119403
8328061,2,B001NXC010,I rented this thinking I might learn a thing or two. I was wrong! the barre my teacher sets is more difficult than what the students here demonstrate. There is also a rude student who kept disrupting the teacher. Center work is beyond simple as well. Nothing fancy. I was disapointed.,1311984000,,284,4.588235294117647
8328062,5,B001NXC010,"It is rare to see dancers at this high level submit to being filmed as they go through their daily exercises under the ballet master's tutelage.  These exercises enable them to achieve the artistic mastery they display when executing the choreography of the classic ballet roles.  As a student or balletomane, when you find yourself before such events, you must open your eyes and go to them not ask them to come to you. 40 minutes of pleasure.",1233014400,3,444,4.67948717948718
8328063,5,B001NXC010,Very instructive to watch teaching methods used in training and practices at one of the world best Russian ballet.  The 40 minutes long video shows how some of the world best professional ballet dancers are trained and their daily routine designed to keep them in great shape and to allow them to achieve world class ballet performances.  Delightful to watch.,1232323200,5,359,4.966666666666667
8328064,5,B001NXC010,This video presents one of the best Russian State Ballet Theatre with it principals who performs daily ballet class to stay in great shape for stage. Video designed to watch grace and beauty of dancers and enjoy it. There is no instructions as moves of dancers are so precise and complete that it makes this video very special and just pleasure to watch.,1231632000,2,354,4.634920634920635
8328065,1,B001NXC010,"This home-made-movie style rehearsal presentation is of poor quality and most certainly not worth the 20 viewing minutes or $24.95  price tag. The rehearsal of the grand pas de deux was routine and the instructions for dancer improvement was given in a very muted Russian, which made it useless for non-Russian speaking viewers. Watching a rehearsal should be instructional as well as showing the viewer the immense hard work the dancers put in to learning their roles.  I was greatly disappointed.",1231545600,6,498,5.135802469135802
