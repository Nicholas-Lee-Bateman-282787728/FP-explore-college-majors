4005834,3,B002W650NW,"Just watched this short travel video. It's less than 30 minutes and seems like it was produced some time in the 90s. Has that corny feel that younger viewers will probably find to be comical, but it also presents a decent amount of history and a few travel tips.",1356048000,,262,4.36734693877551
4005835,1,B002W650NW,"This video is a complete waste of money. It's old (eighties?), footage is crap and it doesn't tell you much at all. You will find better material on youtube for free. Too bad really, because there are not a lot of travel videos on the Philippines out there.",1345852800,,257,4.375
4005836,4,B002W650NW,"I bought this dvd in the hope to give my parents a short, compact overlook about the Philippines. I enjoyed to watch it and is nice to watch especially for people who have never been there before. People who know the Philippines better might miss places like the famous rice terraces. Not to forget: it lasts just 22min! Anyway the film is giving a lot of information and impressions about the country, their inhabitants, their culture and nature. It is making curious to go there.
I had some difficulties with the colours of the movie. They went on and off frequently . Although my DVD-player is able to handle NTSC and PAL/SECAM DVDs likewise, I am not sure the TV is able too, since it is an elder model. I will test the DVD soon with other devices. Anyway I assume it is just my own technical problem and should not reflect about DVD quality itself and in general.",1309996800,2,868,4.465408805031447
4005837,3,B002W650NW,"Gave this to my Mother in Law and Aunt, so they could watch it over the holidays with family, and be unofficial tour guides for a trip down their country's memory lane. I was told it was a huge success, and a great gift.",1265328000,,220,4.0227272727272725
8382843,1,B002W650NW,"I was just browsing and found the video/articles old..it's time to take it down there and replace it with a NEW ONE!  There are better views now more than ever....

I am talking about the video features and not the Philippines itself.  I wouldn't mind going back there every year and experience every regions and its food!",1485388800,,322,4.614035087719298

8382849,2,B002W650NW,"Half of this short was about Manilla, while the rest merely touched on the high points.
Felt as though I was being Sold to.

Oh well, wasn't horrid and was just waiting til the news comes on tv.....",1457395200,,198,4.2105263157894735
8382850,5,B002W650NW,I haven't been back to the Philippines in 30 years watching this video made me homesick and reminded me of a lot of fun places to go to. Thank you,1446681600,,146,3.9
8382851,5,B002W650NW,Outstanding presentation of the Philippines Islands.,1429315200,,52,7.833333333333333
8382852,3,B002W650NW,"The video appears to be a mix of the 80's & 90's; It has a lot of missing and unmentioned parts, and doesn't accurately paint a picture of the modern Philippines.

A remake is warranted.",1362700800,,186,4.314285714285714
