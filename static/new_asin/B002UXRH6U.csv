8381680,3,B002UXRH6U,"I bought this three disc set because it documents a trip through northern Manitoba, part of which my brother and I took many years ago. Our trip was the adventure of a life time, so I could hardly NOT order the set and I'm less than an objective judge. That being said, I can say that I was a bit disappointed in the series. In all fairness, I was most interested in the geography and their solutions to the myriad problems they encountered, than the interpersonal tensions and conflicts that inevitably arose. I wound up skipping through those parts of the production during which some of the less experienced participants opined at length on various aspects of the trip itself or the motivations and actions of others on the trip. That all seemed like standard reality show stuff about which I have zero interest.

One the positive side I thought the cinematography was wonderful, which was a real plus, as I never tire of seeing beautiful renderings of the pine forests and clear waters of the north country. I also enjoyed the stories of how the project came to be and the arduous preparations required. The portrayal of the welcome the group received at some of the settlements they passed early in the trip was really touching. It really underlined the historical significance of the trip and the pride the Canadians have in their history, which I loved to see.

Bottom line for me: This was an interesting, beautifully shot production which used more monologue than I would have liked to flesh out the story. I think anyone with an interest in canoeing, camping or exploration would find quite a bit to like here.",1367280000,2,1620,4.700704225352113
8381681,5,B002UXRH6U,This is a most excellent journey back to the 1840's when the Fur Trading industry was at it's peak. The documentary if you will is a rich account of present day Canadians following the old Fur trading route in a period appropriate York Boat up lake Winnipeg and to the Hays River and finally to the Hudson Bay Out Post where the Furs were sold. I owned the VHS version but since the more common media these days is now the DVD I choose to purchase this set and have reviewed it several times it is a superb outdoor adventure with amazingly lush scenery. I would highly recommend it to any like minded outdoor adventure seekers.,1366761600,4,627,4.413793103448276
8381682,5,B002UXRH6U,"There is very little reality in ""reality"" shows. They are generally contrived and over-dramatized, populated by people chosen by their personalities to create ""interest."" Disgusting.

This is not such drivel. This is a legitimate attempt to recreate a historical occurrence. True, these are modern people, not psychologically adapted to true wilderness; kinder, gentler, and far more ""civilized"" than the historical York boatmen. This gets them into trouble, but they are intelligent people who learn from the experience. None of them brings an excess of psychological baggage on the trip (unlike the production the same company did after this one.) Experienced wilderness travelers and hivernants will find the series entertaining, and may be grimly amused by some of the civilized mistakes the participants make.

The series is also a visual delight, and the background music is perfect.",1361923200,4,889,5.529411764705882
