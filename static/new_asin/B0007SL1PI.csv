8051164,5,B0007SL1PI,Okay so i previously made a review about this series and commented about how completely disappointed i was about this series. But as a saiyuki fanatic to the bone i couldn't stop watching the series over and over and little did i know that i would grow to love third season as much as the other series! This is awesome and i'm glad i gave it another chance...talk about a strong commitment haha!,1385856000,,395,4.424657534246576
8051165,3,B0007SL1PI,"This dvd was basically fillers that didn't make a lot of sense...  But I really like Saiyuki regardless of fillers, so long as it continues, episode 11 was kinda funny...",1162598400,,170,4.666666666666667
8051166,4,B0007SL1PI,"I agree with reviewer, SK, that episode 10 (Demon Genjzo Sanzo) makes the whole DVD worth the price. I will not watch the other 3 of the fillers again as they mostly concentrate on stories of humans/demons our heroes encounter during their journey. But I have watched episode 10 twice and each time just have to burst out laughing. It is simply hilarious. Well done!",1130112000,,366,4.6461538461538465
8051167,4,B0007SL1PI,"Having been a big fan of ""Saiyuki"", I've been fairly disappointed in the followup series, ""Saiyuki Reload."" Geneon's dubbed version is far cry from the wonderful ADV dub, and the series itself is not nearly as interesting as the original. The artwork is choppy, and the stories are mainly fillers. DVD 3 is no exception, although the second episode on the disc, ""Demon Genjo Sanzo,"" made the whole thing worthwhile for me.

While the other three episodes are very typical Reload fillers, ""Demon Genjo Sanzo"" has a very amusing plot, and the way it plays out makes me laugh every time I watch it. If all of the filler episodes were as good as that one, Reload would be a much better series.",1123200000,,689,4.6016260162601625
