7781360,2,B01H7QA6J4,"Dr. Michael Slovak (John Speredakos) runs an institute in Rhode Island to study telekinesis. He recruits people who have this power and experiments on them. Zach Connors (Graham Skipper) and his girl friend Rachel Meadows (Lauren Ashley Carter) are the strongest of the two. They are kept drugged up, have spinal fluid extracted and injected into Dr. Slovak. Not to hard to figure out where this goes.

This is a low budget, ""Scanners"" type of film. The film had a lot of decent gore effects such a head explosions and head splitting, kudos Melissa Asci and whoever else was involved. For some reason they opted to make the film stupid. First they used a demonic voice distorter for Dr. Slovak which didn't come across too well. If you are going to shoot people a few times, either have them die, or hobble around. Don't bring them back like nothing happened. And was was with the grimace contests that were gong on all the time. It looked like the stars could have used a decent stool softener. I was confused why Zach allowed guys to live who were trying to kill him and I didn't understand the vein distortion side effect.

Now it did win ""Best Director"" at the Austin Fantastic Fest 2015 against some good competition so maybe its just me. Minus 1 star for the voice distorter. Sometimes less is more.

7781361,1,B01H7QA6J4,"Without a doubt, the absolute worst movie I've ever watched.  The acting is horrid, with very few exceptions. The attempts at SFX are, at best, amateurish.  I had to force myself to watch it until I could not stand it any longer.....approx 75% of it....and I should be given an award for watching that long!",1470700800,,307,4.5636363636363635
7781362,1,B01H7QA6J4,"Absolutely dreadful rip-off, homage or unofficial sequel to the David Cronenberg classic Scanners about an evil scientist who is doing research on subjects with telekinetic abilities in order to steal their powers for himself.  There is so much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin.  It clearly wants to recreate the look and feel of early Cronenberg and while the sound design and music are pretty good, The Mind's Eye looks like it was shot on digital video--in other words, it looks absolutely nothing like any movie you would have actually seen back in 1981 when the original Scanners was released.

The Mind's Eye lacks the budget for a special effect like the signature one in Scanners where a human head explodes during a public demonstration gone awry.  That special effect was shown in the Scanners trailer and is largely responsible for the movie becoming a huge financial success.  35 years later, The Mind's Eye's idea of a special effect generally involves actors with guns acting like they are pointing them at themselves against their will.  That's about the best this movie has to offer in terms of telekinetic special effects.  On the bright side there's some gore, but not nearly enough to make the movie watchable or interesting.

The acting ranges from adequate at best to pretty dreadful--whether the filmmakers thought they were being cute by getting people to act like they had no talent or genuinely didn't have the money to hire professional actors is hard to say for sure, but the final effect is the same either way--which is that The Mind's Eye frequently feels like a Machete film without the intentional comedy.

The Mind's Eye is so worthless it actually makes the notoriously awful official Scanners sequels look like classics by comparison.  Unless you are friends with someone in the cast or crew there is no reason to waste your time watching this dreck.",1470528000,3,1907,4.894409937888199

7781365,5,B01H7QA6J4,"What a fantastic film!  A hugely successful homage to Scanners, Firestarter, and a whole slew of other 80's and 90's gems.  Beautiful visuals, a pulse pounding score, edge of your seat sound design, and some of the most gooey practical effects I've seen since Cronenberg.  I loved the director's first film, Almost Human, and with The Mind's Eye he has outdone himself.  Kudos to the cast and the crew.

7781374,4,B01H7QA6J4,"This was a great second effort from Joe Begos. The story was compelling, the mind battles were fittingly ridiculous, and the climax was climactic.

It wasn't perfect but if you leave wanting much more I'm not sure what you expect from dark 80s-90s psychokinetic horror. This one checked all MY boxes.

Graham Skipper is a bloody, veiny Jedi.",1470787200,,341,4.862068965517241

From the practical effects to the music alone make this a must see. Sure it's been done before, scanners, fire starter but this little gem is a must see for all u mind movies with a good taste of GORE.",1470787200,5,371,3.96
7781376,5,B01H7QA6J4,"A great throwback to '80s horror, Joe Begos takes a leap forward from his debut film (the excellent Almost Horror). A solid cast, a propulsive plot, and some of the best practical effects seen in a long time. Highly recommend.",1470787200,2,226,4.675
8764873,4,B01H7QA6J4,"the soundtrack was great, and the last half hour was very good and had some great practical effects, but how many viewers will make it to the last half hour, due to the really slow and amateur first hour?  I would have spread out the action and violence to keep interest.  also, there was more screaming than acting.",1533254400,,316,4.431034482758621
8764874,4,B01H7QA6J4,"Great movie, but after seeing Joe Begos' previous movie Almost Human I'm not surprised The Mind's Eye was so good.  I've read other reviews with people giving it grief because of it's retro feel and saying that it was too derivative of the David Cronenberg Scanners, but those were the two elements that I really enjoyed about The Mind's Eye.  I've been so disappointed with most mainstream horror movies coming out lately that I usually watch old movies from the seventies or eighties anyway.  In spite of all the technology filmmakers have access to today, it seems like some vital element got lost, a vital element that I often seem to find in older films like David Cronenberg's Scanners, John Carpenter's The Thing, Lucio Fulci's The Beyond, Dario Argento's Deep Red, or Lamberto Bava's Demons.  Some of the criticism heaped on The Mind's Eye I've also heard aimed at another fairly recent horror movie The Void.  Everybody else is welcome to their own opinion, but I loved The Mind's Eye and would recommend it to anybody who's into any of the horror films I mentioned earlier.",1526169600,,1083,4.801075268817204

8764876,3,B01H7QA6J4,"This had a great premise, great music, and an awesome 80s/90s throwback feel, however, there were gaping plot holes and the characters tended to act really dumb and annoying. Towards the end I found myself not caring what happened because everyone's actions were so infuriatingly idiotic. Almost good.",1492473600,,301,5.291666666666667

8764878,2,B01H7QA6J4,"I really wanted to like it. I didn't mind that it was low budget since the concept was good. But the behavior of the characters and the script were just bad. The use of powers was, for the most part, lame. I liked that is was set in the 80's/90's. It's in style since Stranger Things. It's an entertaining moving, but you'll mostly just laugh at the low quality and yell at the characters to act better and to make logical decisions.",1484524800,,433,4.2926829268292686
8764879,4,B01H7QA6J4,"Let me tell you right off the bat, this is a low budget and indie type film and having said that....this does not always look that way, the stunts and such are way and truly above the norm. I am very impressed with how the director got things done on what had to be a tiny budget and still looked ultra-professional. This could have been a bit better but it still fell back on the whole mad scientist type thing. More psychokinetics are being born and one, doctor Slovak claims to train them and teach them....claims! Please keep in mind that the acting is a little better than average and so is the story. A very predictable ending happens and it is still not too bad. Will I recommend it? kind of, depends on how much you pay for it.",1480204800,,735,4.257142857142857

8764881,4,B01H7QA6J4,"Fans of David Cronenberg's Scanners will dig this clever, marvelously-shot, if familiar, homage from young writer-director Joe Begos, who made his feature debut with 2013's uneven but impressive scifi horror shocker Almost Human. (The earlier film itself was a derivative homage to films of John Carpenter, Cronenberg and others.)

Stylish, shot in washed-out 70s colors, it stars Graham Skipper and Lauren Ashley Carter as powerful scanners with telekinetic powers who fall into the hands of Evil Scientist Guy (John Speredakos) who has promised to help them tame and control their powers. Thing is, being evil, Evil Scientist Guy has other plans -- of the nefarious kind!

The leads do a fine job, though the acting is wooden in parts. The FX is rudimentary and includes an awkwardly shot car explosion that looks goofy.

I know I should give the film a much lower rating but I'm a sucker for this particular micro-genre. I mean I've watched all the sequels to Scanner and let me tell you, they are not good.

By the by, check out ""The Atticus Institute"" which combines the  whole psychic mind-power thing with the demonic possession thing.",1476316800,2,1142,4.989473684210527
8764882,4,B01H7QA6J4,"Remember when horror films were dark, violent and made by adults for adults? Yeah? Well so does director Joe Begos and his latest film The Mind's Eye is a throwback to the pre-PC days of 1970s and 1980s horror. He clearly wears his influences on his sleeve - Cronenberg and DePalma most notably - but that's kind of the point here. It's the early 1990s, but an alternate 90s where psychokenisis is a documented phenomena and appears to be on this rise. Zack Connors (Graham Skipper) is a powerful scann....er, psychokinetic who is on the run and trying to keep a low profile. He is found by Dr. Michael Slovak (John Speredakos) who runs an institute for psychokinetics which is ostensibly there to help but of course we know he's up to no good. Zack allows himself to be committed to the institute in order to be reunited with Rachel (Lauren Ashley Carter), another psychokinetic with whom he shares an unspecified past. We eventually learn that Dr. Slovak is extracting DNA from his patients and using it to give himself an accelerated version of their powers. Our protagonists eventually escape, are pursued by Slovak's minions and the story spirals toward the eventual bloody psychic showdown between Zack and Slovak.
Begos is clearly working with a limited budget here - and it shows at times - but he truly transcends his budgetary limitations throughout. The effects are mostly practical, economical and effective. The acting skews to amateurish, but the earnest performances from Skipper and Carter more than compensates as we come to really root for the young lovers to escape to a normal life away from all this chaos. It's a hoot watching Speredakos chew scenery as he attempts to out-Michael Ironside Michael Ironside and it's always a treat watching indie horror stalwart Larry Fessenden ply his craft (even if he is somewhat less than believable as Zack's retired state trooper - ??? - father). Begos' cinematography effectively contrasts the cold, sterile countryside (a la Cronenberg, subbing New England for Canada) with warm, rich 80s style colors. The requisite 80s style synth score highlights the action and infuses extra emotion into the story, best seen when he uses it to contrast the intimacy of our two young lovers as they get physical against Slovak's ecstasy getting injected with his mutant DNA. This film starts slow but picks up speed progressively when the heads start exploding and bodies get torn asunder. This is a great sophomore effort from a promising director who I quite frankly can't wait to see work with a higher budget and more resources. With all the recent 80s nostalgia it's nice to see someone like Begos mining the more nihilistic side of this era. Throw a copy of this Blu Ray in next time the Stranger Things crowd mentions how much they love the 80s and - yes - have fun watching their heads explode.",1475884800,,2852,4.8583162217659135
