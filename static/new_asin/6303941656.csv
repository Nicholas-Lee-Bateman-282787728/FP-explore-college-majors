7855975,5,6303941656,"Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean is very very funny.  Mr. Bean mumbles more often than he speaks, but this just gives you more time to laugh without wondering what is being said.  Each episode is easily understandable, flows extremely well within each episode, and is suitable for the whole family.  Mr. Bean will take your mind off of your everyday life.  When you are feeling down Mr. Bean can pick your spirits up because no one's life is as bad as Mr. Bean's.  It is difficult to get the full effect of Mr. Bean without seeing him.  He is as innocent as a child, but he is an adult in an adult world.  That is part of what makes him so funny.  One episode has Mr. Bean playing miniature golf.  And because he is ""not allowed"" to pick up the ball he makes a day of ONE hole.  There he is calling ""Fore!"" and then hitting his golf ball all while on a city bus.  I recommend Another Box of Beans  because of the multiple episodes you get where as many of the other products contain only a couple of episodes.  Because the scenes were made for TV, unlike movies that have elaborate scenes, the VHS is clear and as good as a DVD.",1112745600,2,1122,4.186915887850467
7855976,4,6303941656,"This tape includes two episodes of Britain's fabulous funny Mr. Bean: ""The Trouble With Mr. Bean"" and ""Mr. Bean Rides Again"".  Unfortunately, the episodes on this tape aren't as funny as most of the other Bean tapes out there.
""The Trouble with Mr. Bean"" starts off with Bean waking up late for an appointment at the dentist. The funniest scene on this tape is watching Bean drive to the dentist while dressing in his little car speeding down the road. Bean has some work done on his teeth then sets out for the park where he toys with a boy's  boat (and an elderly's wheelchair) and tries to eat lunch while avoiding a buzzing pest.
In ""Mr. Bean Rides Again"", Bean ""jumps"" to help a man who has a heart attack while waiting at the bus stop.  Later Bean gets stuck in a mail box.  Then he packs for a trip and ends up on a plane for a holiday.  The scene on the plane is somewhat similar to the movie scene in ""The Curse of Mr. Bean"", but isn't nearly as funny.
I have grown to appreciate Bean, but wouldn't recommended purchasing this tape unless your a die-hard Bean fan. I hate saying that, but it really is one of the least funny Bean tapes out there. Nevertheless, it is worth watching if you get a chance to see it somewhere.",1074038400,3,1231,4.288793103448276
7855977,5,6303941656,"THE EXCITING ESCAPADES OF MR. BEAN includes two episodes of the hit British series ""The Curse of Mr. Bean"" and ""Mr. Bean Goes to Town"".  When I was younger I never understood the humor of Mr. Bean. However, as I've gotten older and my sense of humor has matured a little, I find Mr. Bean to be quite hilarious.
""The Curse of Mr. Bean"" starts off with Bean attempting to dive off the high-no, make that the very, high dive at a local swimming pool. When he's had his fill of exercise, he attempts to leave the parking garage without paying the ticket by going through the entrance.  Later on Bean settles down for lunch on a park bench, illustrating just how frugle and thrifty he is. Finally, Bean goes to the movies with his girlfriend to see a scary picture.  I have to tell you, the scene at the movies is the funniest thing I have see Bean do.  This tape is worth buying just for that scene alone.
""Mr. Bean Goes to Town"" is the second episode on the tape and though I didn't enjoy it as much as curse, it still has its moments.  It starts by showing Bean returning home with a new television set and the trouble he goes through trying to get a signal.  He takes a walk in the park to take some pictures, but gets taken instead.  Then it's off Club Phut with his girl for a night of club dancing. Bean doesn't fit in well and his girl ends up leaving him. However, Bean gets the last laugh.
The version I have of this tape also includes a deleted seen of the show that didn't originally air on televsion called ""Bus Stop"".  In this short sketch Bean finds himself waiting and losing his place in line as he waits for a bus.
This is a great item to own for anyone who likes British comedy.  Also, the movie sketch from ""The Curse of Mr. Bean"" is a great scene to show to Americans who just don't understand British humor--it's one almost everyone will laugh at.",1074038400,6,1864,4.242937853107344
7855978,5,6303941656,"This guy, Mr. Bean, is funny. He doesn't beat anyone else in comedy. Period",997401600,2,75,4.428571428571429
7855979,3,6303941656,"On the sixth Mr Bean tape, our 'hero' visits the open doors' day of an evening school, and he puts every single subject in embarrassment! He annoys people, yet he's pretty creative too... but, er, who laughs last laughs best, as you know... A quite OK Mr Bean sketch.
In the other sketch, Bean gets tired of waiting for the hairdresser to get ready, so he puts on the uniform himself. Not exactly to the benefit of the costumers. Another OK sketch, but decreasing in quality.
This is not the best Mr Bean tape but it's not the worst one either.",976579200,2,544,4.396039603960396
7855980,2,6303941656,This is definitely not one of the best Mr Bean tapes. It basicly consists of some everyday situations to which Mr Atkinson's sketches do not really succeed to add a little spice. Avoidable without consequences.,975369600,,210,5.0285714285714285
7855981,2,6303941656,"This Mr Bean tape does contain some good ideas, and the sketches are maybe even well-written and well-structured... but in fact, they are not that funny! Basicly a waste of money.",975369600,,179,4.806451612903226
