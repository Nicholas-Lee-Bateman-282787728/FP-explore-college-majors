5647252,4,B00BMEF72O,"In this early film, Jean Arthur's comedic skills are very apparent.  A very unlikely story, but well in line with 30s style.  The rest of the cast add to the poignant goings-ons so that we have some great situations.
You won't be sorry to watch this gem.",1398038400,2,254,4.382978723404255

8570799,5,B00BMEF72O,"Stumbled across this film on the picture box some months ago. Not many gut busting laughs, but plenty of smiles. Good plot & it satisfied my addiction to the lovely Jean Arthur. Toss in Herbert Marshall, Leo Carrillo, the incredible Lionel Stander & the cast meshes together like the gears of an expensive timepiece. Almost Capraesque in style.",1448409600,2,344,4.948275862068965
8570800,4,B00BMEF72O,"If You Could Only Cook is a total delight and unexpected surprise. The story is both featherweight and improbable. Moreover, we can anticipate most of the plot turns. But who cares when everything is done so deftly?
Id never heard of director William Seiter but Im sure impressed with his work here. He has a real flair for composition and dialogue and keeps things moving along nicely. Principals Jean Arthur, Herbert Marshall, Leo Carrillo, and the ever snooty Frieda Inescort (the latter in a much underwritten role) are all in top form.
While this film technically dates from the post-Code era, it has a very pre-Code feel to it with overtones of Ernst Lubitsch no less. Marshall plays a character suspiciously similar to the Gaston role he did so well in Trouble in Paradise and the films general pacing and style is very reminiscent of that film.",1445472000,2,852,4.802721088435374

8570804,4,B00BMEF72O,"Harvard-educated automative mogul Jim Buchanan (Herbert Marshall) is nursing that uneasy feeling. Vaguely dreading his imminent wedding date and disillusioned with the stuffed shirts in his boardroom (who've chosen to dismiss his latest revolutionary car designs), he decides to take a holiday. Out for a pensive stroll, he sits down on a park bench being occupied by the unemployed Joan Hawthorne (Jean Arthur). Joan is busy poring over the want ads. They get to talking, and when Joan espies an ad for a cook and butler with a $175 stipend, she charms Jim into interviewing for joint employment as a husband-and-wife domestic service. Joan is starving and deadly serious. Jim, him what's got the fancy engineering degree, thinks it a lark.

1935's IF YOU COULD ONLY COOK finds Jean Arthur very much in her wheelhouse and Herbert Marshall, not so much, but he's wonderfully game. They concoct a nice chemistry and the farcical bits keep things interesting. A sub-plot emerges when the new butler and cook learn that they'd unwittingly signed on with a Prohibition racketeer (Leo Carrillo) who, by the way, soon starts putting the  moves on Joan. Jean Arthur is one of screwball cinema's finest comediennes, blonde, vivacious, and so endearing with that trademark crack in her voice and that marvelously expressive face. Herbert Marshall, more at home in three-hankie melodramas, applies to good use his elegant bearing and mellifluous delivery of dialogue. As ever, good breeding and flawless decorum translate well to the butling vocation. Still, it's not too long before the racketeer starts suspecting that his manservant is himself a master crook.

Are you prepared for domestic service chaos and good-natured impersonations and for gangsters at home and a wedding wildly interrupted? There aren't really any new twists in this movie. It's just another in a long line of wacky pictures that plays on the Great Depression theme of class reversal. Except that Jean Arthur and Herbert Marshall manage to rise above the trope.

May I suggest that you spend your bones on this DVD collection:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Icons-of-Screwball-Comedy-Volume-1-If-You-Could-Only-Cook-Too-Many-Husbands-My-Sister-Eileen-She-Wouldn-t-Say-Yes/dp/B0024FAG1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Icons of Screwball Comedy, Volume 1 (If You Could Only Cook / Too Many Husbands / My Sister Eileen / She Wouldn't Say Yes)</a>? It's got IF YOU COULD ONLY COOK as one of its four screwball flicks. The other three movies are about as fun.",1404604800,2,2560,5.59020618556701
