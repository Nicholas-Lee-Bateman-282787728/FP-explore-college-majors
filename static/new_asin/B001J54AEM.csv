Josh of course, with or without his hat, is as handsome as ever, and I just love his friendly and outgoing way that he has! With his past  background, and knowledge as a explorer, he is the perfect choice for this series also! Josh, he is so beautiful, he just takes your breath away! When Josh smiles and talks directly into the camera lens, here I am, sitting here, watching him on TV, feeling like he is talking just to me, and of course, when he smiles, I am sitting here smiling back at him, like a idoit, but I love it!

In this series, I felt like I was traveling around the world, seeing all these amazing, wonderful places, and learning about the past! I loved all the Chapters in this 4 DVD set! I always love to hear, and see the priests, and experts, and specialist, and professors, and doctors of their chosen fields, in each Chapter of this series explain, what they are doing, and do it in a way that I can understand it! I also love the way Josh gets in there, and gets his hands dirty, and how outgoing he is with everybody, whether they are rich or poor, or have a degree, or don't have a degree!

 I loved learning about NOAH'S ARK, some people don't believe in the Bible's story of Noah, but I DO, and I loved the beautiful city, and breathtaking scenery, of where the CLOUD WARRIORS lived!
 I thought the Chapter about the GLADIATORS OF ROME, was very interesting, and I loved the one about finding STREETS OF GOLD IN TIMBUKTU! I did not know that there was really a city named Timbuktu, but I do now!

The Chapter about LIVING WITH MUMMIES, that was amazing, how those people lived in the jungle, and the Chapter about the BEAUTIFUL ELEPHANTS, how those wonderful animals need someone to help them! I also loved the cowboy and his dog, hunting for METEORS from MARS and outer space! And of course, I always love to see EGYPT, and learn more about their awesome history! This is a must have for your collection, if you love history, and new discoveries!",1244592000,8,2121,4.3544303797468356
8311940,5,B001J54AEM,I always enjoyed Josh in Digging for the Truth--I have watched these many times over. Into the Unknown is equally good--I recommend it highly to those interested in discovery and search into the past. Josh is a great host with a good personality. A pleasure.,1234224000,9,258,4.7555555555555555
