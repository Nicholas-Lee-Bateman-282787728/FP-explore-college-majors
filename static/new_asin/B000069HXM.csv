7965960,4,B000069HXM,"I am Nathan Guel. I am eighteen years old. I like this, but I would say it is not as good as Kids Sing Praise Volume 1, a show we owned a long time ago. It has great music and songs. I think Kids Sing Praise might sadly be out of print. I sure hope it is not out of print. I highly encourage it for young Christian kids.",1511136000,,320,3.652173913043478

7965962,2,B000069HXM,"Extremely disappointed.  I was told both of these songs were in this package:  1) Jesus Loves me, and that was so.  2) Jesus loves the little children of the world.  That was false.  I am not much impressed with this as most of the songs are not that well known.  Want to return it but do not see a ""Psalms 24"" to return it to.",1489104000,,327,3.953846153846154
