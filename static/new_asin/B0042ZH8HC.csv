8414053,5,B0042ZH8HC,"Daughter loved it, and although she let someone still it, that is on her, I won't be purchasing anything else from this artist for her, it seems everything I get her either becomes stolen, lost or broken.  Like money grows on trees.",1385769600,,232,4.523809523809524
8414054,1,B0042ZH8HC,"this was terrible. the editing was bad. it was like a home movie. there are a bunch of interviews from people who are ""actors, artists, and models"" but ive never heard of them before. basically full of nobodys. this shouldnt even be allowed to be sold. it is terrible. i appreciate them trying to put it together but this should not be sold online because it lead ppl to believe it is a real documentary and it isnt. the cover has a huge sign on it that says ""includes exclusive interview"" which made me think nicki was in it. SHES NOT EVEN IN IT!!!! don't buy this!!!!",1294012800,14,569,4.327102803738318
8414055,1,B0042ZH8HC,"This DVD was freaking horrible!!! I know if were a famous celeb coming up I would be ashamed of such poor editing and effort put into a documentary about myself. This documentary achieved the opposite and that's turn people off to Nicki Minaj. There's no backstage footage, no full live songs or performances... just an all around bad documentary. What a waste... save your money.",1293580800,10,380,4.861538461538461
8414056,1,B0042ZH8HC,"I was excited to purchase this dvd only to find out Nicki Minaj isn't even on the dvd. I understand it is an unauthorized ""documentary"" but they used stock footage that could be found on youtube. It is literally 40 minutes of 3 unheard of an unknown people who claim they are part of the industry talking about Nicki Minaj. If I wanted their incite I'd go to a forum or something and save my self 15 dollars. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME GETTING THIS DVD IT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE AND A WASTE OF MONEY!",1293494400,18,509,4.204081632653061
8414057,2,B0042ZH8HC,i thought it nicki would have been speaking on the dvd but its all good still learn a thing or 2,1292803200,,96,3.619047619047619
