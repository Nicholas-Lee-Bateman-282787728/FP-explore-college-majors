891021,4,6304501153,"True, it's not as grand as what we saw in the first Beauty and the Beast, but the fantastic fact that all actors came back to do the sequel (if you can call it that) is great. The animation is NOT poor and is actually very  pretty. The story is strong and it is a fitting and warm yuletitde DVD  title. It has some great songs which people will love and they are sung by  O'Hara as in the original. What most people forget is that this title  doesn't have to conform to the tight, well known, fable that the original  had to. The flexible narrative suits the subject - which is love,  freindship, and seasonal spirit. I would defend this title and say it is  great for all. I'm 21 and found it most pleasing. P.S: Don't you think the  titles sound like Savana the soap opera show? Hmmm....",957571200,6,789,4.213333333333333

Not very christmas-y. Kiddo had bad dreams and now she's afraid of the beast and won't even watch the original, which is sad because until this movie, she was obsessed with the beast and belle.",1515628800,,360,4.640625

The villain (an organ) is kind of scary and his animation is more CG, so he appears out of place with the other characters who are animated in normal fashion.

After we started watching it I remembered how awful it was but had already wasted my $15.  My children that watched this range from ages 1 year old to 12 years old.  This movie is extremely scary and dark, not at all what you think of when you see the pretty colorful cover picture that's advertised.  I'm so disappointed that I wasted my money and bought this.

891305,1,6304501153,"A dark, warped, Christmas-themed rip off of the original Disney classic. This movie is exactly why sequels are viewed with so much skepticism. The relationship between Beast and Belle is portrayed more like that of an abuser and his victim. Add to this a new antagonist, an inexplicably evil character intent on destroying everything. Even the soundtrack is lousy. My daughter enjoyed watching this as a young child, but it is such a bad movie and had such a twisted storyline that we always felt guilty allowing her to watch it.",1490918400,,529,4.824175824175824

This movie is very dark. The piano forte is a dark character. He tries to deceive Beast through out the whole movie. He is very destructive and loud.

891491,4,6304501153,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who loves ""Beauty and the Beast"" and Belle to watch before Christmas and she loved the movie so much that we watched it at least 10 times this past Christmas season. I had never seen it before and was excited to see it. I loved that all of the original characters and voices were back for this 1997 movie with the addition of a new villain, Forte (voiced by Tim Curry), who doesn't want the Beast to become human again and strives to keep Belle and the Beast from becoming friends, falling in love, and breaking the spell. The movie is set right after the Beast saves Belle from the wolves in the original movie, but before they fall in love. Christmas is around the corner and Belle wants to celebrate, but none of the servants want to celebrate because the Beast has forbidden it. Forte plots to keep it this way.

I really liked that we learn why the Beast forbids Christmas - it's because it was on Christmas night that the Enchantress disguised as the beggar woman cast the spell on him (as seen in the original movie) and he's become very bitter over it. They did a good job connecting pieces of the original film to this follow up. I was slightly disappointed by how much of the film is dark and brooding for a Christmas movie, not at all bright and cheery until the end. Eventually the Beast learns the true meaning of Christmas through his love for Belle and by the end we are brought back to present day when Belle and Prince Adam are having a Christmas party for the neighborhood villagers - much of the movie is set in flashback. We really like the movie, but I wish it had some more cheerful parts.",1483228800,5,1652,4.329032258064516

891790,1,6304501153,"My toddler, husband, pet Chihuahua, and I agree that this is the most displeasing and violent movies we have ever seen. This is horrible. A complete waste of money. And wretched follow-up to the original film. My daughter absolutely loves the original Beauty and The Beast, but this so-called ""Christmas"" version is a joke. They completely left out the joy of Christmas and filled this disturbing film with scenes of negative talk, violence, drowning, pushing, death, and sinister characters. PLEASE, do yourself and your family a favor, and DO NOT PURCHASE this movie!!!!!",1477526400,8,573,5.172043010752688
891791,4,6304501153,"Beauty & the Beast is my all-time favourite movie, and I can be fairly particular about it, so as a child when it came out, I was excited but apprehensive. When it most recently was re-released on dvd I purchased it and watched it today for the first time in 15 years or so.
PROS
-it has some great songs (i.e. ""Stories"" and ""As Long as There's Christmas"")
-it has almost all the original voice cast
-the characters mostly have the same feel and personality to them, which is important as this takes place in the middle of the original film
-I liked seeing Belle & Beast falling in love expanded
-the circumstances surrounding the spell are expanded
-the message of Christmas being about hope
CONS
-some of the events are essentially ones that happened in the first movie all over again, only in a slightly different way
-some of the songs are forgettable
-there is not as much time and care put into the animation
-the action seems a little too over the top at times
-I would have liked a longer happy wrap up, especially because the movie is fairly dark
-it is scary for children. I didn't watch it a lot as a kid for that very reason",1477440000,,1136,4.388625592417061

About the story: it takes place during Belle's first Christmas at the castle and how she strives to bring back Christmas, this story adds a whole new layer to the story of Beauty and the Beast and it fills in a little blank spots in the original (like the ball room scene was on Christmas day and the beast was turned into the beast on Christmas) The villain was a little scary to me as a young child.

892164,5,6304501153,"Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is one of my ""must-watch"" videos during the Christmas season. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie, and I was not disappointed in this one. The story takes place before the beast is transformed at the end of the original movie, but begins during the first Christmas the couple (and their faithful staff) celebrate. Chips begs Mrs Potts to tell him a story, and thus The Enchanted Christmas. There is a villain, Forte, who tries to prevent Beast from growing closer to Belle, and he is pretty intense. Some younger viewers might find the facial expressions (he is the organ) and loud, dark music to be frightening. There's also a scene where two characters nearly drown.

The plot moves along quickly, and even though you know what is going to happen, it won't matter one bit. Belle is sweet and strong-willed, Beast growls and is endearingly vulnerable, and Forte is one of Disney's best and darkest villains. There's humor, too, and a few jokes the adults will catch. The music is lovely and the singing is terrific and includes ""As Long As There's Christmas."" This appears to be a mix of CGI and traditional drawing. They work well together, though you can tell the difference. Not a bad thing. The colors are beautiful and are not washed out or pale.

The original voice actors are featured, along with Tim Curry (who sounds like he a great deal of fun playing the villian Forte) and Bernadette Peters as Angelique. Everyone puts a great deal of effort into their characters and making them come to life. Among the bonuses is a very interesting behind the scenes look at how the video was made.

A bit pricey, but for Beauty and the Beast fans, I highly recommend the splurge.",1387584000,6,1737,4.688524590163935

Real sad...but then I saw this movie and remembered all the good times I used to have watching it with all my childhood friends around the holiday.  A giant smile erupted as I realized that I could watch it over amazon.  I ran to the computer and was ready to hit play until I found out that:  DISNEY MADE SURE THAT I WOULD NOT GET TO SEE THIS MOVE  THIS CHRISTMAS.  THERE LICENSE PROHIBITS SOMEONE WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS.

892297,5,6304501153,"Beauty And The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is a direct-to-video Disney animated film. It is a midquel that takes place within the original film. It takes place after Belle is saved from the wolves, but before the fight with Gaston. All the voice actors from the original film return in this one.

In the film, it is Christmas Eve, and Belle wants to plan Christmas with everyone in the castle. Most of the characters tell her they don't think she should because Beast might get upset.

In this movie, Beast is still a hothead and a bully, but he tries to control his anger and hot temper and he really wants to be nice to everyone.

When Beast finds out she is planning Christmas, he gets angry, because it was on Christmas Day when the Enchantress turned him into a Beast. At one point he confronts Belle about it and he forbids it, but she doesn't care, and she plans it anyway with or without him. Throughout the film, there is an evil pipe organ named Forte that is trying to prevent Belle and the Beast from falling in love. We also get introduced to new characters like Angelique, Fife, and a carpenter Axe.

It was so negative and filled with yelling, destruction, and anger.  I understand that conflict is required to move a storyline, but this is movie has only the thinnest thread of a storyline (Forte the organ wants to ruin Christmas and run Belle off, inexplicably), so the entire movie is Belle and castle creature friends trying to make Christmas lovely and Forte talking Beast into destroying the efforts.  Of course it all works out in the end but truly in about the last 90 seconds.  Nothing like inviting children to sit in front of an hour or more of almost non-stop hostility (with peppy interludes) and a last-second Christmas-is-saved moment.  Yippee and a Cranky Christmas to all....",1340582400,,809,4.875912408759124

892509,1,6304501153,"Being I could not rent this for the longest time and having a five year old daughter who loves Disney movies - especially the princess movies - I thought I'd take a chance and get B&TB - Enchanted Christmas.

This movie has very little to do with Christmas on any level.  No Santa, No birth of Jesus.  Christmas is just the impetus for a darker plot.  The story focuses on the Christmas season just before the Beast ""learned to love.""

The movie is 50% dark material with an evil pipe organ, Maestro Forte, the court composer who does not want the enchantment spell broken.  Forte considers himself the Beast's best friend, and he uses creepy, dark opera music...ala Phantom of the Opera style...to keep the Beast in a defeated mental state to perpetuate his prominent position within the castle as the Beast's confidant.

Belle threatens Forte's position and plan with her strong will to want Christmas, and goes behind the Beast's back to decorate and prepare for Christmas with the other enchanted characters.

Forte, voiced by Tim Curry, does a great job at scaring the be-jeebers out of the audience, which was not the expected viewing for a family movie night during the Christmas season.  We're not talking about the Abominable Snow Monster in ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" or the Winter Warlock in ""Santa Clause Is Coming to Town"" in the classic Christmas animations that children...and their parents...have loved for years.  Forte's creepy music and scary faces are more reminiscent of the evil Queens in ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" both of which the audience is expecting in the natural story-line conflict.

This is not an encouraging movie for small/young children.  It's not a fun Christmas movie.  With the exception of the minor storyline setup of Bell writing a story of hope for the Beast as a Christmas gift, the movie has little Christmas value.  The storyline is trite in comparison with the original B&TB or other Disney titles.

As for this movie, I would only recommend it for older children/families who might like it for the conflict storyline value like ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty.""

If you are wanting an uplifting; encouraging; simple story focusing on the Christmas season - stories about love, forgiveness, hope, elves, Santa, Jesus, or just a Christmas feel-good movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - this movie is NOT it.

This movie could have been so much more.  We were all VERY disappointed.  This one won't stay in our collection.  This movie would have been better remaining the Disney vault.",1324166400,6,2546,4.931924882629108
892510,4,6304501153,"In 1991, Walt Disney Animation Studios debuted their 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line and the film would achieve commercial success as it earned over $377 million worldwide and was the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and the film also received six Academy Award nominations, winning an award for ""Best Original Score"" and ""Best Original Song"".

And to capitalize on the success of the film, Disney would release the two midquel's of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" trilogy: ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" (1997) and ""Belle's Magical World"" (1998).  The films would take place when Belle was being held inside the mansion of the beast and both trying to get to know each other.

VIDEO:

""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (1:78:1).  For a direct-to-video ""Beauty and the Beast"" midquel, the production was obviously higher budget with the use of CG.  Even the animation is much more fluid, colors are more vibrant, more detail and shadowing are utilized in ""The Enchanted Christmas"" and utilizes CG similar to the original animated film.

I saw no artifacts, no white specks and scratches.  For the most part, picture quality is very good considering this is a direct-to-video release and it being released in 1997.  It's unfortunate that this quality didn't transfer over to the third film in the trilogy ""Belle's Magical World"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, 5.1 Dolby Digital French and Spanish language tracks.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Enchanting and an entertaining continuation to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" animated film.  ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is a wonderful family film for the holidays featuring the fun and vibrant characters of Disney's popular animated film.

""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is the midquel to the popular animated film and an answer to the many fans who have wanted to see Belle and the Beast once again!  It is no surprise that the film would receive a sequel or midquel as the original film literally made over $300 million in the box office, especially considering the original film only cost $25 million to make.  So, it was great to see ""The Enchanted Christmas"" made but also to incorporate the beautiful painted backgrounds, the vibrant colorful characters, wonderful animation including the CG animation that made the animated film so enjoyable, but incorporating it to the direct-to-video film.

""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is a holiday film that brings the cast back together again and one of the enjoyable moments of this film is that we get to see how happy everyone as humans (post-spell) and seeing how Belle and the Prince are so happy together, but also a story that shows what happened during the Holidays when Belle was still being held captive inside the castle and seeing how she was able to bring Christmas back into the castle despite the Beast being against it (as he was turned into a beast on Christmas day).

A big question is if one should upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray.  I would say yes, only if you are a big fan of the film.  The Blu-ray definitely brings out the colors of the animated film, especially the detail.  Everything looks much more clearer and the banding issues that were on the DVD aren't in the Blu-ray version.  The Blu-ray version of ""The Enchanted Christmas"" looks very good and to hear the soundtrack via lossless is also another plus.  If anything, the film looks and sounds great in HD and is definitely worth the upgrade.

Overall, ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted"" Christmas is a wonderful holiday film for the entire family.  And because it comes with both a Blu-ray and DVD, parents or grandparents can definitely benefit from watching this film via a long holiday commute or keeping the young one's occupied during the Winter break.

But if you are a ""Beauty and the Beast"" fan and looking for an enjoyable family Holiday film, ""The Enchanted Christmas"" is for you!",1323993600,8,5864,5.038421599169263

She loves all things princess and will not watch this movie again.  My daughter is now five and decided she wants to part ways with the DVD.",1323820800,2,310,4.4035087719298245
892512,5,6304501153,"I have always loved this movie since I was kid. Now seeing it as a young adult, I can appreciate it even more in brilliant high definition! I must admit that the picture quality is terrible on the original VHS and even earlier and current DVD versions. But once you see in on Blu-ray, the animation is so crystal clear that it looks new again and literally shines on your big screen compared to the major grain on the other releases in the past. While the animation is not up to par with the original, and some of the characters movements are robotic at times, high definition sure does a damn good job of bringing it close. Don't go into this movie expecting the same standard as the original because there won't be. For what it is, it's above average.
The songs of course are great. Loved that the whole original voice cast came back. People are complaining that this movie scared their children, especially the villain Forte. Honestly, I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven years old in 1997 and I was not all scared but entranced. Really though, it can't all be candy canes and lollipops just because it says Christmas in the title. This isn't Tinker Bell and the Magical Christmas Tree. This is one of the very few Disney sequels that I actually enjoy (next to the Lion King 2: Simba's Pride) and not despise like so many others (the Hunchback of Notre Dame II... need I say more? Now lets never speak of it again).
If you want a great holiday movie for your kids, or for the kid at heart, than pick this up! However, I would highly recommend seeing it on Blu-ray as the other qualities pretty much suck, but still worth it I suppose given that it's a great ""midquel"" to the BATB franchise. Heck, if I loved it so much on VHS you could imagine how much I love it even more on Blu.

Important Note: Belle's Magical World sucks.

Although my son was captivated and watched the entire DVD, I don't think
my son will have any interest in seeing it again.

The Beast was angry the entire movie.  There is another ""evil"" character named
Forte that tries to pit the Beast against Belle and Christmas.
The Beast is constantly losing his temper, destroying things, and even throws Belle into
the dungeon at one point.  Overall, it just isn't relaxing or enjoyable to watch...most
of the scenes are dark and gloomy.(I started advancing past the parts with the evil
Forte the organ)  They finally get to have Christmas and that lasts about
2 minutes, what a let down.  They over emphasized the Beast's anger, the evil guy, and conflict for sure.

I actually thought the animation was well done and happy that the voices were the same as
the original Beauty and the Beast.  The one Christmas song was pleasant.

Who doesn't know about Disney's animated version of ""Beauty and the Beast""? The truth is, every person, living in this planet in the last eleven or twelve years, probably has seen or heard about it -- one of Disney's biggest blockbusters in recent history. The truth, also, is that no child's movie collection can be without this classic. And a great addition to their collection for the coming holidays happens to the equally wonderful ""Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas"" in its brand new Blu-ray edition.

The story of the film is quite simple, really, but incredibly fulfilling. It begins one night, around Christmas time, when Mrs. Potts is requested by the guys at the castle to tell a story about Christmas past, when the Prince was still a Beast, and Belle was still his captive. And it goes like this: One day, during Christmas Eve, Belle decides to celebrate this glorious holiday, and convinces everyone in the castle to help her to arrange a big Christmas gala. It was meant to be a surprise for the Beast, who, unbeknown to Belle, hates this holiday due to bad memories from the past. Everything is going well until Forte, the former, jealous, and sour court composer, decides to prevent the celebration to take place. Forte thinks that ""humanity is over-rated"" and that ""happiness is depressing."" Accordingly, he devises his own plan to stop Belle's noble effort.

Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas"" is good, old-fashioned animation at its best, full of great colors and inspirational, tender moments - perfect for the family to enjoy together and an awesome gift for the kids. The Blu-ray + DVD edition includes Disney sing-along mode, Disney song selection, behind-the-scenes features, and much more. Released November 22, 2011. (USA, 1997, color, 71 mins plus additional materials).

When it arrived my wife was like a little school girl getting a special treat for being good, however we did not watch it until 2 nights ago after installing our new Insigna 46inch LCD 1080p TV and man I tell you what it looked so good and so clear that you would have thought we had never seen this movie before. The animation, the artwork, and the CGI was absolutely breath taking. In the special bounus feature they added a christmas back drop to have on that has a fireplace burning with a christmas background and the tradmark Rose on top of fire place mantle along with Christmas music in the background (Great as a back drop for holiday party's). Also new animation was added to the begining sequence of the movie.

Insure to watch this on a full 1080p tevelision for the full enjoyment of this movie on blu-ray, I'm defiantly glad we ended picking this up after all even if we own 2 other copy's of this. I would whole heartly recommend it.

Eisner/Disney has the prince being a complete turd when he was younger and he was awful to the wrong person, who turned out to be a witch, who cursed him and turned him into a beast, on Christmas.  So the Beast hates Christmas.  And there is a sinister evil pipe organ character who controls the Beast through the Beast's hate.

892559,5,6304501153,"...Disney will keep rereleasing their movies in new format for more profits. Kidding aside, I bought this film on DVD years ago after it had already gone out of print. I sadly admit that I must have paid near $80 just for the nostalgic feeling of watching this again at Christmas. Was it worth the eigthy dollars? Probably not, but now people will be able to buy it for less than $30 and that is worth the price, especially in high definition.

It doesn't have the animation quality that the big budget original had but they do the best they can with the budget they have and it will definitely be gleaming on Blu-ray. Some people say that the organ is too scary for kids, really? Is it the voice or what? I just don't see it. He is no scarier than the witch from Snow White, the Pleasure Island sequence from Pinochio, or even Gaston in the final scenes of the original. Parents all have to use their own discretion when allowing children to watch any film but I don't see how the villain here is any more frightening than those other acclaimed classics.

The only downside with this release, not really any new special features. I would have loved a commentary or some new look back, even some classic disney holiday cartoons updated to high definition. I would have loved them but I can't say I expected them. Disney isn't as great at including new material as they have been in the past. There is the new inclusion of segments from the old Lynsey McLeod series Sing Me A Story with Belle, which will be nice to revisit but doesn't seem to tie into the holiday theme upon first inspection.

I guess the fact that I'm now buying this to put it beside my Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray means I'll have spent over a hundred dollars on the film. It might not be worth it to most but I thoroughly enjoy this film and it's fun to find time to watch it every Christmas.

I say 5 stars because I do love it, but let's be honest and say that if the original film is five stars this one is somewhere between three and four in reality. The production quality isn't as good, understandably, and the songs aren't as sweeping. The story is quaint, fun for the holidays and better than most Disney sequels but there was no way it could live up to the masterpiece of the original. That said, I love the film and I find it hard to believe anyone can honestly say this film negates the impact of the original (which is something that can be said of other Disney sequels). Now I'm just waiting on the separate release of Lion King 2 on Blu-ray and I'll have all the Disney sequels I ever need or want to own.

(Correction: I may not mind purchasing the Aladdin sequels on Blu-ray someday but they feel more inclusive to the television series than the original film and as such I'd be more inclined to buy them in a series set.)

***So having watched it the PQ is about what you'd expect. It isn't a diamond edition wow factor, but it looks crisp clean and like it was just animated, much better than my old DVD did. The special features are all standard definition, so the Sing me a Story segment (which is only good for kids or one nostalgic viewing) is a little hard to watch due to fuzziness. I wish they had made some new features but as a direct to video sequel I knew that wouldn't happen.

I will say I'd only give this a 3.5 or 4 out of 5 for PQ overall though because the organ character, computer generated back in the late nineties, really shows a pixelated or digitized appearance. He clearly wasn't rendered in a high quality image and there was no way to change that now and it shows. I'm still happy I bought it, I love this film at Christmas and other than the pixelated digital organ, expected lower production values than the original that I was already aware of and no real new special features I thought it was great and worth the price after using the 5 dollar off coupon Disney is offering online.",1317427200,17,3901,4.342935528120713

892604,4,6304501153,"Beauty and The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is one hour and twelve minutes long and was released on video on November 11, 1997. The movie was originally supposed to be a direct to video sequel with Avenant, as Gaston's younger brother, seeking out revenge on Belle and the Prince. That ideal was scrap and the film became a midquel. The film picks up where the Beast has just recued Belle from the wolves in the original Beauty and The Beast.

Belle wants to celebrate Christmas, but the Beast has strictly forbidden Christmas in the castle because that was the day the he was turned into a Beast. The new villain this time around is Forte. Forte was the Prince's chief conductor of music at the castle and was transformed into a pipe organ. Unlike the other resident of the castle, he is please with his transformation believing that he has more power now. Forte does not want the Beast to fall in love with Belle and will do anything to stop it. In the end Forte is destroyed by the Beast and if you saw the original movie, then you now how the story ended and that is basically the movie for you in those few sentences. Besides Forte; Angelique, Fife, and Axe are the new characters in this movie. Also in this movie the Beast does not have as many lines as he did in the original movie.

In the end I thought there were too many musical numbers that could have been left out of the movie and the movie itself was too predictable. I am a big fan of if ain't broke then don't fix it. Die hard Beauty and the Beast fans may want to but this movie. Beauty and The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas gets a B-.

Who cares if it isn't 100% believable to an ADULT that it happened during the first film. To a child it never even crosses your mind.

The animation here is competent but fails to dazzle like the original, the villain is too droll, and there are no memorable songs. Since computer-animated fare have taken over the theatre staples, Disney has turned toward the direct-to-video market, and unfortunately, knocked off some rather lame sequels to their classic animated films.

If you want a great film, then stick to the original ""Beauty and the Beast"". Better luck next time, guys!",1169942400,,525,4.965909090909091
892680,5,6304501153,"Those who watched Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" knew they were watching something special. The first Disney film ever to released on Platinum Edition DVD, that movie had a powerful and compelling story with a cast and musical numbers to match.

Set in the Beast's castle, back before the spell was broken, comes ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas."" Mrs. Potts takes readers back to this tale which begins on Christmas Eve. Christmas is coming and Belle couldn't be more excited. Little Chip is excited to hear the news of Christmas too, but when Belle starts planning a celebration, she's stopped in her tracks. It seems ""the Master,"" Beast, has forbidden Christmas and the servants don't want to go along with her plan. Belle convinces them otherwise and even when the Beast rebels, she still goes ahead.

""Beauty and the Beast"" is hard act to live up to and while this film isn't quite up to the same standard, it is still another great story and one I enjoyed watching. The original ""Beauty and the Beast"" featured a terrible villain, Gaston, and this film has one to match --- one that is perhaps even more terrifying. Forte was the musician in the castle and when the spell was placed on the castle, he was turned into a pipe organ. He now feels useful because his gloomy music seems to be the only thing that makes the Beast forget his hardships. So when he notices what's happening with Belle, he wants to put a stop to it and uses a little flute named Fife as his lackey. At first, Forte is a bit of a sympathetic character, for it's not hard not to sympathize with his worries of loneliness should the spell be broken. But when it seems like things are not going his way, Forte becomes truly horrifying.

As with ""Beauty and the Beast,"" whose most memorable song matched its title, this film also has one song that stands out in particular --- ""As Long As There's Christmas.""

As long as there's Christmas, I truly believe / That hope is the greatest / Of the gifts we'll receive.

By the time you get done watching this video, you will have heard it four times --- twice sung by characters during the film and once during the closing credits, performed by Peabo Bryson (""Aladdin"") and Roberta Flack. There is one final performance --- see below.

This special edition video release is close-captioned, recorded in SP mode and Hi-Fi stereo. Before the film starts, there are previews for other film, video and DVD releases, including Miramax's ""Pinocchio"" and Disney's ""Lilo and Stitch"" (which has been out for sometime now.) After the film, stay tuned for one more rendition of ""As Long As There's Christmas,"" a pop version performed by PLAY.

This is a film worth adding to lineup of holiday specials. It really does capture the Christmas spirit and is essential viewing for ""Beauty and the Beast"" fans.",1135382400,6,2828,4.678068410462776
892681,5,6304501153,"This is a well above average sequel from the ""Mouse house"". The animation, while not quite up to the pedigree of the classic original, is pleasant enough to make for an enjoyable watch. The songs are also quite good. ""As Long As There's Christmas"" is without a doubt the best of them. ""Don't Fall In Love"" is not so good. Then again, considering it's sung by the villain of the piece, it's not supposed to sound good is it? The voice acting is excellent. That Disney was able to get all of the original voice talent back sets the sequel above average anyway. However, Paige, Robby, Angela, Jerry, and David are able to slip effortlessly back into their roles. The Special Edition DVD that I paid $30 for at B&N after placing it on a special order is a neat little package. Call me sappy, but I happen to like the poppy version of ""As Long As There's Christmas"" by Play. The ""making of"" featurette is cool, but not really what I would call in depth. The ""Enchanted Environment"" is a waste of disc space if you ask me. The video quality is awesome (1:33.1) full frame. I don't mind that though, because the movie was made that way. All in all, Beauty And The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is a pleasant holiday movie that the whole family can enjoy.

Yes, there is always a ""villain"" in their movies, but in this case, I think it was overdone -- he was just too scary.  It is supposed to be a Christmas movie, after all, which in my mind means light, fluffy and fun  :)
On the positive side, the storyline is quite nice and production quality is outstanding (surprising for a part 2-type movie -- ie. The Return of Jafar was crappy compared to Aladdin), but I personally won't be playing it again for my kids for a few years, it's simply not appropriate.",1104710400,8,715,4.393939393939394

But Forte, the former court composer, is against the idea.  The current pipe organ has become used to being the Beast's confidant and advisor and is threatened by the idea of Beast falling in love and the spell being broken.  Enlisting the aid of Fife, he tries everything he can think of to ruin Christmas and drive Belle and the Beast further apart.
Overall, I'm not too impressed with most of the Disney straight to video sequels.  But this one is entertaining.  The storyline is engaging, even if the ending is obvious from the start.  The idea of setting the ""sequel"" in the middle of the original movie is wonderful, and helps develop all the characters.  Yet the wrap around part shows us the human characters again and how things have changed.  All the original voices are back, except for Bradley Pierce as Chip, who is replaced by Haley Joel Osment.  In an effort to appeal to kids, the main target for this movie, Chip has a larger role in this one, but it really helps advance the story as well.
As with most Disney animated sequels there are two major flaws.  The animation isn't as good as the original, although it certainly works to tell the story.  Also, with the exception of ""As Long As There's Christmas,"" the songs are immediately forgettable and actually take away from the enjoyment of the movie.  Also, clocking in at just over an hour, it's pretty short.
The picture and sound on this DVD are fantastic.  For a special edition, this DVD is short on extras, but the number they have are fitting the movie.  There is an interesting making of documentary, but the rest of the features are for kids to enjoy.

However, ""Beauty & The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"", along with ""Winnie The Pooh's Grandest Adventure"" is one of those straight to video sequels where Disney did put some effort in. Granted, certain continuity as with Belle's dress is partly stretched, but this sequel isn't at all bad. The animation is inferior to ""Beauty & The Beast"" but is superior to other Disney video sequels. It also has great music and is full of Christmas spirit.
However, as with my review of ""Beauty & The Beast"", I'm gonna focus on the special features and the DVD itself. First of all, the film is digitally remastered and looks fantastic. As for the special features, ""Beauty & The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" has ""Forte's Challenge"" game; an Enchanted environment fireplace; Sing-along song tracks; and a music video by Play. There is also an exciting behind the scenes documentary which I was very impressed by. With this documentary, whenever a bright circle appears on screen, if you press play, the documentary will go into greater depth before returning to where it left off.

Despite being released after smash hit movie ""Beauty and the Beast,"" it is not a sequel, this story is an added into the events of the first film.

Belle wants to have a Christmas party and Beast forbids her, therefore setting the stage for new turmoils with the new bad guy Forte an old organ who is a bit sinister for my likes.
Another new character is a Christmas tree fairy/Angel named Angelique.  She is the expert on organizing parties and celebrations.  However, other than having an absolutely darling accent she plays little to no part in the movie.
It has the usual songs for a Disney Movie which are pleasant and nice but none are not overly memerable.

892732,1,6304501153,"I was deeply disappointed when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) said ""Happy Hanukkah"" just once although he had been repeating ""Christmas"" all through the story. I felt an American awkward effort of politically-correctness. Disney should have referred it as ""Happy Holiday"" from the beginning if they really wanted to make it p.c., or I strongly believe that they should have stuck to Christmas due to the fact that Beauty and the Beast is based in the 17 century, France.
Other than that one line, the animation was plain and there was no dynamic movement as Belle did when she was choosing a book in the original movie. The only well-drawn character was the new girl Angelique from the animation point of view.
The music was far below the level of the original movie scores by Alan Menken, unfortunately. There was no much for Be Our Guest, Belle, Guston nor Human Again.
If you barely know the original movie Beauty and the Beast, there is a chance you'll enjoy the Enchanted Chrismas.

892736,3,6304501153,"Going by what other reviewers have already said, I bought this DVD as a gift for my brother and sister. Around mid-afternoon on Christmas day, we sat down to watch it. Considering that I'm a lot older than the target audience and a lot more cynical about Disney productions than I used to be, it's to the film's credit that I still enjoyed it. Not near the quality of the original, and not quite up to par with Disney's greatest direct-to-video release Aladdin and the King of Thieves, but still a nice little holiday movie.
The movie has many high points. All of the original cast is back, except for Chip, but he's actually been replaced by Haley Joel Osment. This immediately gives this movie some credibility, as the voice actors are all top notch. Joining the cast is another great actor, Tim Curry as the villain Forte. Coupled with some delicious computer animation, Forte is a very worthy villain. He towers over everyone else, accomplishes much evil even though he is bolted to the wall, and is really creepy in human form. Unfortunately, he gets the one dull song in the movie, but thankfully, all the others are top-notch fun. And the animation in general is very good; a few characters look slightly off at times (Lumiere and Cogsworth in human form in the intro, for example), but overall everything has a very warm, rich feeling.
So what are the movie's low points? The story itself doesn't disappoint, but it's nothing super special either. It won't match up to other holiday classsics like Garfield, Peanuts, Grinch, and Disney's own A Christmas Carol. And while almost everything fits within continuity with the original, it's best not to think about such things. Just because Belle wore her yellow dress to dance with the beast in the original, does it mean that was the only time she wore it? No, but using the dress again kinda tarnishes the magic of that moment in the ball room. The only glaring continuity error is at the movie's end. While the movie packs in some decent action (which I did not expect from a holiday movie), you'll find yourself wondering how everything was restored back to normal later. Other than this, I wish they had used that lovely feather duster character more instead of making her another background object. And lastly, the movie seems a little too dark at times. If your TV set is darker than normal, a lot of the fine details in the animation will be lost on you.
But overall, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is worth owning. There's good acting and animation, and while the story isn't quite up there, it's worth a repeated viewing, and might in time join your family's lineup of traditional holiday movies.",1040774400,,2675,4.705756929637527

892771,4,6304501153,"The original film is such a masterpiece that it sets the bar so high for this sequel, and you have to keep this in mind when you sit down to watch this. First of all, I think it is such a delight to have the entire cast from the original back and at it. I think the film would really have been hurt if even one of the voice actors had been replaced.
I think what made the original so strong was the music and lyrics of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Every song was beautiful, witty, and did so much to develop the story and characters. There a but a few songs in The Enchanted Christmas, and the only one that is somewhat memorable is the song ""Stories"", whose melody becomes a sort of musical motif that recurs throughout the film. The interesting animation sequence during this song is one of the highlights of the film, and it is nothing like anything featured in the original.
If you are a die-hard fan of Beauty and the Beast like myself, you will enjoy seeing the characters in action... but, sadly, it feels different and less magical than the original. The script is a little thin, and the voice acting isn't totally consistent with the original. For example, Robby Benson, who voices Beast, sounds very strange at times and seems to be overacting. But it seems that the Beast in general is very exaggerated throughout the film so this is probably not Benson's fault. Paige O'Hara as Belle as always has a remarkably beautiful voice, whether she is singing or talking. It is so wonderful to hear her put life into the character again.
One thing that I feel was very wrong with this film is that an entire sequence was devoted to showing how the Prince turned away the Enchantress on Christmas and became the Beast. I think that the original film did a marvelous job by telling this part of the story through the stained glass sequence in the beginning, but seeing it portrayed here again sort lacks that fairy-tale wonder to it that the images in stained glass conveyed so well.
Aside from this minor point, I believe if you enjoyed the original like myself, you won't have too hard a time of enjoying this film. Like I mentioned, it would be impossible to match the beauty and magic of the original solely in that the music just cannot match the genius of the Menken/Ashman collaboration. Even though the animation is low-budget, a wonderful soundtrack would have made the sequel great.
My commentary on the Special Edition DVD is that I thought the behind-the-scenes feature was wonderful, and although it is short, you get some really great interviews from the voice actors including Tim Curry who makes his debut as the story's new villain. You don't get to see Paul Reubens though, whose voice and character I found rather annoying. No big loss. One problem I had, however, is with the quality of the image. The Special Edition of the original on DVD has an amazing picture quality, and the colors are so lucid and spectacular, yet in the Enchanted Christmas DVD the colors are somewhat dull and faded. Aside from that, the other special features are just some nonsense that is thrown in just to satisfy the Special Edition title, but the behind-the-scenes feature is good enough for me.
On a final note, I noticed that there are Roman numerals on the side of the DVD cases of both films. Supposedly there will be a third Beauty and the Beast Special Edition coming out soon. Can't wait.",1038355200,5,3400,4.575409836065574
892772,3,6304501153,"Be warned that this movie isn't necessarily for the little ones. It's fairly scary and intense at times, but not much more than the original. Much of this is brought on by the fact that this movie has a central, ominous villain, whereas the original did not. Also, given where this story takes place in the original's timeline, the Beast is still mean, coarse and unrefined, prone to a lot of yelling and destruction. On top of that, the villainous Fort sings a song that very clearly and deliberately contains the word ""hell."" How that made it into a G-rated movie is beyond me.
The movie itself isn't as bad as one might expect for a straight-to-video sequel. It also doesn't have a lot to do with Christmas other than it happens to take place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The holiday basically serves as a plot device to allow the Beast to thaw a little. As a movie, it's pretty decent, but as a holiday movie, it's not so good. Can you think of a better way to celebrate such a heartwarming holiday than with a movie containing an explosive, abusive Beast and a song that screams the word ""hell?""
The special features of the DVD are so-so, but credit goes to Disney for doing something other than releasing a bare-bones disc. The behind-the-scenes featurette isn't really behind-the-scenes of THIS movie, as much as it is the B&B series and animation in general, but it's informative on a surface level. The memory game is kind of difficult at first, but since it doesn't change, you'll never visit it again once you master it. The Enchanted Environments are an interesting addition as they are simply mock fireplaces. Also included is a sing-along feature that puts the words on the screen as the songs appear in the movie, as well as stand-alone sing-along selections. These nifty features allow your children to read profanity as well as sing along. As an unlisted feature, I suppose you could program your multi-disc player to insert the chapters of this movie into the appropriate place in the original for an extended viewing experience.
If we had seen this movie before purchasing it for our four year-old daughter, we probably wouldn't have bought it. Still, it's an entertaining movie for older viewers that has about as much to do with Christmas as Die Hard.",1038182400,7,2279,4.714285714285714

Natch, the ending is o.k., but they only focus on like 3 minutes of happy.  If they went potty at the end they'd miss it.
We should have gotten the Pooh one, not this one.  I doubt they will want to watch this again.  Not a holiday classic for us!!",1037059200,12,519,3.849056603773585
892776,5,6304501153,"It's a little something for all Beauty and the Beast fans. It's sweet and enjoyable. The songs are nothing compared to the original animated feature but still it's worth a check. It revives Disney's magical tale that earned an Oscar nominee for best picture! Note: Unlike the Oscar-winning feature, this is something that will probably appeal more to kids- so based on a children's perspective (younger cousins) I give it a 5- but unlike the original feature that I gave a 5-star to, I give this a 2-3 star from an adult's perspective.

  The tale revolves around the lovable cast celebrating Christmas a year after what you saw in the original tale. They all start to have an argument over who saved Christmas the year before. They then go back to the original tale but in more detail this time. There are more new characters and a whole new villain. The 'musical' villain serves as a friend to the Beast. He's quite jealous and his music helps the Beast relax. Watch how the characters plan, sing, destroy, and save Christmas!

  The story is of coarse nothing compared to Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Still with the characters returning to their objects and Belle singing around about 'stories', this feature is definitely worth seeing if you enjoyed the original!",1031702400,10,1269,4.798165137614679
892777,5,6304501153,"I got this movie for a birthday present when I was 7 (my birthday is right after Christmas). I totally loved it, and I still do, 5 years later, lol! It's a really cute movie and I think lots of kids would like it.",1030406400,7,213,3.8636363636363638
892778,4,6304501153,"Compared to today's Direct To Video Disney, this 1997 ""sequel"" to Beauty and the Beast seems very high quality. The animation does not match the original, no DTV ever will, but luckily it lacks a lot of that flat feel that plagues many Direct To Video productions today. Perhaps because the colors are darker. The only problem is the lack of detail in the backgrounds at times, it's too simplistic. And the characters sometimes are very flat, with no depth like the original classic.
All the original voices return from the original (except Chip), which gives it good continuity. Tim Curry is excellent as the villain Forte. The songs are strong enough, better than anything I've heard in most of the other DTV's from Disney.
Now, to the big problem. Despite the entire movie taking place in two days, it's very hard to swallow that this entire new story took place within the first film. There was not enough time in the first film for this ""lost chapter"" to have taken place. Continuity errors arise when the Beast imprisons Belle for trying to escape (she was going to cut down a Christmas tree) after giving her word that she wouldn't leave. Problem is that Belle already fled once before in the original, when the Beast rescued her from wolves. And after that incident, the Beast and Belle began to get closer almost immediatley.
Even worse, it turns out (unless Belle and Beast wore the same outfits twice) that the ball room sequence in the original occurred during their Christmas celebration. C'mon, it was obvious that it was not Christmas during the original. It was winter yeah, but Christmas was the last thing on anybodies mind during the incidents that occurred in the original. Oh, and also the Beast hates Christmas becuase it turns out that he was turned into a Beast on the holiday. (Guess the narrator forgot to mention that in the original, didn't he?)
As far as trying to make this story fit within the original, I think a below average job was done. So why four stars? Because even though this does not hold a candle to the original, it is still a very good holiday movie, on it's own, for children. This is much better then those annual Mickey Mouse and Winnie The Pooh Christmas movies that Disney puts out, and I can gaurantee that parents will have an easier time sitting through this movie than those.
It is also vastly superior in terms of quality when compared to recent Disney sequels, just compare this to ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" and you'll see what I mean. Just don't expect a Best Picture Oscar-calibre film like the original was.",1028419200,21,2573,4.669603524229075
892779,1,6304501153,"One of the reviewers said that Forte was jealous of Belle because
Beast looked to him for comfort. That's incorrect. Forte was gay.
He labored under an unrequited attraction to the Prince. Did you really think he chose Fife as an accomplice because Fife was the best one for the job? Fife was an idiot. He chose Fife because Fife,a very phallic object,was a reminder of Forte's lost

I'm sorry to say it but it does not hold up well and I'd rather watch the original. I stress again that only kids should watch it since it'll appeal more for them, while adults will think of it as a horrid sequel.",1018656000,,625,4.131147540983607

The best thing is the presence of the entire original voice cast; Paige O'Hara as Belle, Robby Benson as The Beast, Jerry Orbach as Lumiere, David Odgen Stiers as Cogsworth and Angela Lansbury as Mrs Potts.  Joining them as brand-new characters are Bernadette Peters as Angelique, Paul Reubens as Fife and Tim Curry as the evil Forte.  There is also Haley Joel Osment in the role of tiny Chip.

892821,4,6304501153,"This title is an excellent sequel to the original Beauty and the Beast. It tells about an untold chapter after the time when Belle was rescued from a pack of wolves by the Beast, but before the Library scene. The Beast is still cold-hearted and ill-tempered, but Belle is attempting to get him out of this unacceptable form of behavior. She decides to bring Christmas to the castle (despite the fact the Beast hates the holiday; Christmas was the time when the fairy transformed the then Prince into a Beast), and establishes a plan using all of the Enchanted Objects to celebrate Christmas. There is a villan in the story: A notrocious pipe organ named Forte. As is shown in the movie, Forte was the court composer. The whole Beauty and the Beast trilogy takes place during the early Industrial Revolution (c. 1780) and the scene of the Prince just before his transforation into the Beast reveals Forte dressed in Baroque period clothing. The pipe organ was an extremely popular instrument in the Baroque era, and this clearly shows one the approximate time period in history. With the help of Fife, a young piccolo, Forte plans to rid Belle's plan by coaxing her into the Black Forest in an effort to possess a Christmas Tree for the castle. She nearly dies in the process, but the Beast rescues her again. This time, he is furious at Belle leaving the castle grounds, and throws her in the dungeon. After opening the present Belle gave to him, the Beast finally looks at Christmas in terms of it's true meaning, and releases Belle. We ultimately see Forte's demise as he attempts to demolish the castle using excessive sound levels. He commits suicide after the Beast removes his keyboard. Forte was extremely jealous at Belle because the Beast looked to him for comfort after the spell was cast. The ending is very nice, and sets the stage for the ballroom dance seen in the first movie.
With very good animation, as well as comical script, this movie is a must have for all familes during the holiday season. Although not as good as the original, it still has many of the characteristics we all cherish.",1010275200,,2108,4.684636118598383
892822,4,6304501153,"All right, it's Christmas so I'll get my ""Bah, Humbug"" stuff out of the way first. This was produced by Disney Television animation, so visually it's not as rich as the original. The characters seem a little flatter, the backgrounds not as detailed. That said, however, the computer animation used to bring Forte, the court musician turned pipe organ, is magnificent! Unlike the rest of the castle staff, Forte is quite pleased with the curse of the Enchantress, as it gives him purpose: consoling the Beast's desolation. By animating him in a different style from the rest of the film, he becomes even more removed from the other characters, more otherworldly. If it seems lacking in the visual department, we couldn't ask for more in sound. The original cast has been brought together with new characters voiced by Paul Reubens (better known as Pee-Wee Herman, though his Fife sounds worlds apart), Tim Curry (as the aforementioned Forte), and the angelic Bernadette Peters.
The story is a simple story of hope. The bulk of the movie is a flashback between Belle's rescue from the wolves and the Beast's gift of the library in the original movie. It's December 24 and Belle believes that bringing Christmas back to the castle will help cheer up the Beast. Unfortunately, it turns out that it was a Christmas ten years ago when the curse was laid upon the castle and is now forbidden. Not only does she have to overcome the Beast's sadness, but also Forte's scheming to prevent her from breaking the spell.
Overall, the songs and story bolster up the animation to make a worthwhile addition to a holiday movie library.",1008460800,5,1619,4.827338129496403

The movie reunites Belle, Beast and the other characters in the castle from the 1991 movie. And this time Belle and Best team up with so new charcters.
But the old ones are still around. The new characters include a pipe organ named Forte (Tim Curry), a piccolo named Fife (Paul Reubens) and a christmas tree angel named Angelique (Bernadette Peters). As the movie opens, Lumiere (Jerry Orgen) and Cogsworth (David Odgen Stiers) can't see eye to eye on who saved Christmas. So they talk Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury) into telling the story.

The story is very good and the concept is innovative. Rather than being a follow-up to the original movie, the story takes plays during Belle's stay at the Beast's castle during winter and Christmas. This accounts for an episode that occurred during her stay in the original theatrical film. The music, songs and animation are above average compared to the usual direct-to-video productions. My whole family enjoyed this one. I usually stay away from direct-to-video movies but I highly recommend this one for its production values and innovation.",997574400,4,720,5.110169491525424

That is all THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is: A soulless byproduct of committee thinking. These are not the characters we know and love from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST; they're clunky forgeries bereft of soul and depth.

In this department the House of Mouse too  often goes for quantity over quality.  It's unfortunate to mar a classic  with theses watered down re-visits.  The animation in this one would  qualify as above average Saturday morning fare.  It could have been much  worse.  The concept is somewhat interesting, returning the viewer to a  supposed Christmas incident that took place whille Belle was held captive  by the Beast in the original film.  However good the concept, the actual  story is a bit weak and drags out the standard ""true meaning of  Christmas"" theme without much new to say.  All the original voices are  back, which is nice.  However the heart and soul of the original is  missing.  The songs are afterthoughts and forgettable.  This might keep the  young ones who are fans of ""Beauty and the Beast"" entertained  but, unlike it's predecessor, ""The Enchanted Christmas"" doesn't  stand up to repeat viewings.  Most people will purchase this to ad to their  clam-shell collections of self declared Disney classics and that's exactly  what Disney was banking on for this ho hum installment.
