Some however, are very dark and creepy, some are excessively violent and some have strong language and some have all of these things.  If you can tolerate a fair amount of gore then you might find ghosthouse funny but be warned YOU NEED A STRONG STOMACH!",1400284800,3,335,4.491803278688525
6118744,2,B00GV8AZRI,"It could be that I'm just growing weary of the recurring jokes or of insult humor, but this didn't appeal to me in the same way that other releases have.",1399334400,,153,4.133333333333334
6118745,3,B00GV8AZRI,"While not a terrible riff movie, it could (i feel) have been much better the jokes were few and far between, there were long moments of pauses indicating that there was nothing funny, or nothing to work with. I really hope we see them get some old 60'-70's material from either here, Europe, or japan they always deliver with that type of material. Old shorts like 21st century calling, and ""Assignment Venezuela"" even ""this is coffee"" from shorts Vol1. is better then ""bore-house"" (sorry) ghost house. To be fair there were some laugh hard moments in the beginning but they were short lived i recommend the crater lake monster, chapter nine from outer space, planet of dinosaurs, galaxy invaders, jack the giant killer live!) all WAY better then this tripe. Heck, ""Shaking Hands With Danger"" was better then ghost-house. Shortoberfest! now that was just shorts but still i would watch that multiple times and still find it funny every time. ghosthouse had an annoying background sound/music that was just simply off-putting, strange, and well.... dumb. Please guys go back to the 70's Japanese material, or 60's stuff from Italy, (Bond Rip Offs) now that was funny.",1399334400,,1166,4.954081632653061
6118746,5,B00GV8AZRI,"This one is A Riff, you can easily watch over and over again, the riffs are all spot on. Its decent (bad) and rather ridiculous horror movie haha (yes I know thats contradictory) about a dead little girl and evil clown doll which demands that she kill at his beck and whim, and a Ham Audio operator and his european girlfriend, whom investigate a strange noise heard over their ham radio - leading them to the eponymous ""Ghost House"" where they meet Jim Dalen, who has no problem constantly reminding you - that hes her with his sister Tina and they're staying in an RV parked outside, oh and theres also a drifter/squater/hitch hiker who loves to tell you how much everything, sucks haha. This movie was made to be riffed. Its been available as a Video On Demand title at the Rifftrax official site for awhile now but we finally got a hard copy (which looks great, played in my PS4 btw).

Also this came out at the same time as the ""Christmas With Rifftrax: Santas Village of MADNESS"" which is 3 shorts shot by K. Gordon Murray, who brought you the MST3K episode ""Santa Claus"" and also features clips of Santa Claus spliced in with the shorts shot at Pirates World (as was the classic Rifftrax ""Santa Claus and The Ice Cream Bunny"", an Florida Amusement park that got dominated when Disney World opened and bankrupted them, atleast the one in Diana Florida - no idea about the other two - but its now demolished, and turned into condos lol - (with 4 bonus extra shorts! yay bonus material on a rifftrax dvd finally haha). If you liked Santa Claus episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and/or Rifftrax - Santa and The Ice Cream Bunny (which is also available on dvd, amazon instant or as a VOD title @ the official Rifftrax site) - You'll most likely fall in love with Santa's Village of Madness haha.",1392681600,12,1803,4.496951219512195

6118764,5,B00GV8AZRI,"Rifftrax in general is a great buy with guaranteed laughs, and Ghosthouse is no exception.  The movie was a certified stinker with bad acting, bad special effects and locations that look like they were just done in someone's house.  The idea behind why the house is haunted is actually kind of interesting, but done so poorly it's hard to appreciate.  This is just the sort of movie that Rifftrax excels at working with.  The jokes were as good as always, and made for a good night's entertainment for my family.",1459900800,,512,4.655555555555556

6118767,4,B00GV8AZRI,"oh my god this movie...if this wasn't being riffed i would say its the crappiest horror flick ever,but these guys have a field day with it. they get to be a little more colorful than they were on mst3k as are a lot of the rifftrax films they rip if you're uncertain of buying you can test run watching it on hulu but i was more than happy to buy it",1446076800,,348,3.915492957746479
6118768,2,B00GV8AZRI,"I love Rifftrax and have been a fan of MST3K for a majority of my life. However, this particular Rifftrax film fell very flat to me. I can't say this was a particularly horrible movie, I've seen much worse, but something about it just didn't gel with Mike, Kevin and Bill's humor. Unfortunately, I didn't laugh at many of the jokes and was bored overall.",1438819200,,354,4.461538461538462

6118781,4,B00GV8AZRI,"Ghosthouse is an 80's low-budget suspense/horror film, with plenty of (cheesy, obviously fake) gore and violence. Another reviewer thought we might need a strong stomach to watch it, but I didn't find it too disgusting or frightening, and I consider myself pretty wimpy in the stomach department.  I've watched it several times, and, like the MST3K classic Werewolf, it kind of gets better every time. Like Werewolf, it has a spooky house, bad special effects, a dull feather-haired male protagonist, and a wooden female lead with an unplaceable accent. But Ghosthouse has more - it has chile, creepy music, child sociopaths and an old dude who sounds ""like he's from Gay Ireland."" There's lots to love about this Rifftrax effort. Recommended.",1428451200,6,743,5.140495867768595
6118782,3,B00GV8AZRI,This release is has much of its gore and best scenes edited down quite a bit and I was pretty bummed out with this rifftrax because of that.  Other than that this movie is amazing when viewed uncut and Lenzi does a great job with its creepy atmosphere and the soundtrack is very memorable... I recommend getting it uncut where I definitely would rate it a 5 star horror movie.,1427846400,,376,4.371428571428571
6118783,5,B00GV8AZRI,"I love Ghosthouse--it's my favorite terrible horror movie. It has everything you could possible want in a bad scary movie: dreadful special effects (including real maggots), an evil clown doll, and of course, that classic movie character Jim Dalen. This is one of my all time favorite Rifftrax.",1420416000,3,294,5.145833333333333
6118784,5,B00GV8AZRI,Very Funny!,1416787200,,11,5.0
6118785,4,B00GV8AZRI,"I'll be candid: ""Ghosthouse isn't one of my favorite Rifftrax episodes. It isn't that the riffs aren't good; they are in fact very good, it's just that the underlying material is largely boring. There's also a good deal of (generally unrealistic) gore, making the entire mood of the film markedly darker than any MST3K or any episode of Rifftrax I have seen.

The film centers around a house with a ghostly clown infestation, and a ham radio operator and his European girlfriend who pines for nothing more than a great bowl of chili. The chili procuring scene is a highlight and must have thrilled the Rifftrax crew with the writing possibilities that flowed from it. At the center of the hubbub is the ghost of a little girl, an evil clown doll (actually a bit creepy, but mostly just ridiculous,) and an astonishing plotpoint involving the relative popularity of Kim Basinger and Kelly LeBrock. This is a controversy of high drama and isn't ever satisfactorily resolved, unless, of course you never cared in the first place, like me.

This is a huge slice of late 1980s cheese, and if you want to see some good riffing over a truly annoying movie (the musical score alone makes this film indefensible,) ""Ghosthouse"" is a good choice for you. Go get yourself some chili and settle in for a wild ride. I'll take mine with extra beans. And cheese.",1415923200,5,1346,4.6991525423728815
6118786,4,B00GV8AZRI,"This movie, directed by the great Humphrey Humbert, may very well be the worst movie ever filmed in the greater Boston area.  It's different from the previous Mystery Science Theater 3000 type of movies, in that it contains scenes of graphic gore, as well as some profanity.  The riffs are, like they were back then, absolutely hilarious!  In an early scene between the male and female lead characters, they are in the middle of an engrossing conversation about screams for help heard over the guy's ham radio.  The women suddenly blurts out, ""I'm starved. I'm going to get some chili.""  Neither Martin Scorsese nor Steven Spielberg could have filmed a more realistic, slice-of-life scene.  The evil clown doll in this movie is creepy, but no match for Chucky.  The music that accompanies the doll and the ghost of the little girl, accurately described as being played by a ""demonic chipmunk organ grinder,"" is more annoying than scary.  The grisly deaths continue over the course of this film, but the ending is unsatisfying.  The movie never answers the question it posed about whos more popular in Denver, Kim Basinger or Kelly LeBrock?",1409270400,11,1139,4.9214659685863875
6118787,3,B00GV8AZRI,"A fine entry in the Rifftrax line but, for this selection, I felt the guys were not quite as sharp with their riffing and the movie itself was disappointing. It was bad but not bad enough to be good -- just okay. Still, it is watchable while surfing the net or cleaning house. :)",1409097600,2,279,4.185185185185185
6118788,4,B00GV8AZRI,"Yeah it's got a scary clowns, ambiguously European Girlfriends, Recreational Vehicles,  a HAM radio operator, it even answers the burning question of who is more popular in Denver, Kim Basinger or Kelly LeBrock?! Now what more could you want? How about the cast of the MST3K a.k.a. RIFFTRAX adding commentary? Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy are always at their best when the movie is at its worst... and this one makes MANOS look like a cakewalk!

This Rifftrax title is available here on DVD, but check for it and others offers via streaming here and at Rifftrax.com. Also offer are commentries for syncing with less horrible DVDs you already own! Like Star Wars and Harry Potter.",1405900800,,693,4.864406779661017
6118789,4,B00GV8AZRI,"Oh Ghosthouse.  I don't know who or what your creator ripped off to create you.  But they should have been stopped well before the ideation phase of the script-writing process.  Alas, it tain't all bad, as we're left with a good episode of Rifftrax.",1402790400,,249,4.613636363636363
8627734,4,B00GV8AZRI,This film wouldn't be watchable were it not for the riffing.  The guys do a great job with a truly bad foreign film (that was made in the US).  The guys do a particularly good job of mimicking the lead actress' German accent.,1532044800,,225,4.209302325581396
8627735,3,B00GV8AZRI,"""Ghosthouse"" falls into that category of less-than-good bad movie wherein the producers and everyone involved with it KNOWS it is going to be bad, and couldn't care less; they're just trying to knock it out under budget and get paid.  Of course, the pleasure derived from viewing such an inept and ill-conceived bad movie is a personal matter; maybe you especially enjoy these types of train wrecks, but personally, I find them a bit insufferable.

For me, the premium so-bad-it's-good movie is the kind where the film crew give it everything they've got and honestly think it has value (e.g. ""Timechasers,"" ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" ""The Room,"" etc.).  ""Ghosthouse,"" however, seems more like it was made on a wager (""I bet you can't make a horror movie with just a creepy house, a clown doll, and some girl dressed in white!"") What this turkey  REALLY needs is a reprise of that memorable scene from MST3K's ""Cave Dwellers"" where, at the close of the experiment, Tom Servo goes through all the continuity goofs and other visual faux pas of the movie, and intones ""They just didn't care.""

If you've read this far, you're probably a bad movie aficionado, and I'm sure you can relate to what I'm saying, so I'm not even going to pass judgement on the riffs because I know my objectivity is tainted.  To sum up, your enjoyment of ""Ghosthouse"" is dependent upon whether you enjoy pain or not.  Go in peace, brothers and sisters, and choose wisely.",1526601600,,1446,4.7370517928286855

8627739,5,B00GV8AZRI,"WARNING: Contains bargain bin level gore and a very fake dead cat - - oh! - and fly larva squirming on a skull mask (it's kinda gross).

Ghosthouse is a steaming pile of entertaining nonsense from Italian master of cheez, Umberto Lenzi.

It's an absolutely horrible movie. DON'T MISS IT!

The joy they found in ripping this derivative slab of junk to shreds is audible in the voices of Mike, Bill, and Kevin.

MBK do a couple of funny and unexpected bits involving sound effects; they should take similar risks in other releases.

Kevin steals the show when he sings lyrics over a couple of the simplistic (and catchy) soundtrack tunes.

Rifftrax: Ghosthouse is funny, fun, and gross. It's a perfect riff for Halloween or a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1506988800,3,749,4.767441860465116
