8426280,4,B004DY3LEQ,"This tells the story of celebrity archaeologist and all round ladies man Harry Jones, played with aplomb by Michael Sheen (`Frost Nixon' and loads more) he is back in Wales doing his TV show and he visits his long suffering brother Jason Hughes (`This Life' TV series) who has been coerced into marrying his over demanding girl friend.

However he is still pining for the one true love of his life Sinead (Angline Ball -`The Commitments') whom he met on an idyllic holiday in `sunny' Galway, but his love was thwarted. Well big brother decides to give his little brother a stag night and so piles him into a private helicopter and takes him off to a destination unknown, well it was always going to be Galway wasn't it. Then the fun really starts to build up as skeletons are revealed in more than one cupboard, the shenanigans of the locals are anything but legit and Harry finds he has not been a very nice person at all oh yes and Sinead is shacked up with the local Mr Big - doh!

This is actually a really nice film, Sheen is as ever brilliant playing the `can't help himself' narcissist. The plot has more than enough twists and there is a love story to boot. It is a self assured production that pays homage or pokes fun at many an older movie but in a very kind way. The directing and the timing are spot on. This is the film that launched Michael Sheen's career apparently and it is reflected in the quality of the whole thing. It's a bit leftfield but that is just how I like them and not a bad performance from anyone, it is good to see independent films that can teach the big guys a thing or two.",1360368000,,1609,4.306930693069307
