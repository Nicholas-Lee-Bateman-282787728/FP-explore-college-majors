5004866,5,B006MHZDSO,"A lot of people tend to put this series down as being nothing but inane nonsense.

And they're absolutely right.

But that's exactly what makes Bobobo so great. It's a show that is so nonsensical, it borders on genius. The series is essentially a parody of the shonen genre, and the typical ""main hero with special powers and group of friends fight evil overlord and underlings"" plot is the backdrop which gag after gag is piled onto. Where many series of this type have occasional bouts of random humor, Bobobo is one of the few that relies solely on its' own chaos to propel events forward. Just as one joke is ending, you find yourself in the midst of another one. While the anime, I find, lacks a certain something from its' original source material, the anime version of Bobobo is a great choice for one of those days you just feel like having a good laugh. Recommended for those who aren't afraid to embrace the strange and different, and understand parody for what it is.",1332892800,10,978,4.551136363636363
5004867,5,B006MHZDSO,"Wow !!! Finally it's here Bobobo-Bo-Bo-Bobo a true random anime that will make you laugh i guarantee it.
This series is so random, but fun to watch you will never be able to guess what will happen next its truly worth getting since your going to get around 35 Episodes of awesomeness i remember watching this on Cartoon Network and damn i love it every single little thing about it i know most people think this is just for little kids or maybe say that its ""stupid"" but they just don't have a open mind about this. I will get this for sure hopefully other people will also get it since its better than other Bad Anime out there that only involves with Huge Boobs and Sex related things its really sad that most of the anime of today has that on almost every character and don't even bother making the story interesting and unique like back in the day.",1331769600,11,852,4.33125
5004868,5,B006MHZDSO,"It's about time. After 10 or more years someone finally put this crazy and totally awsome show on dvd with more than just 4 episodes. I am a huge fan of Bobobo-bo. The best Anime with comedy and makes fun of other Anime as well. If you like slap stick, nutty, and stuff that just doesn't make sence at all, then you will love this. A first hero that uses his nose hairs as whips and listens to his nose hairs for battle, is one great comedy. You have to see it to believe it. This Bobobo-bo fights a guy called Baldy Bald a man who goes and tries to cut everones hair as one of his evil plans is wierd enough. But theres more to it than that. Theres tons of crazy heroes that helps him fight all these crazy battles along the way, and even weirder ones that becomes his side kicks. Once again, you have to see it to believe it.",1331683200,16,827,4.048780487804878
5004877,5,B006MHZDSO,my boyfriend loves this show! he says's it's like adventure time because of it's randomness! lol i love adventure tiime so i guarantee you will love this show!,1381536000,,159,4.714285714285714
5004878,5,B006MHZDSO,This show was always a favorite of mine. It is crazy and more than slightly insane. No complaints about the Japanese subtitles not bein' there.,1365552000,,143,4.76
5004879,5,B006MHZDSO,"I was sooo pumped when I heard that this anime was going to be published on DVD! I've been a fan of the show for years and have all English Manga's collected thus far, so this was a no-brainer for me!

If you like the silly, wild, energetic, over-reacting, irrelevant and random type of humor, you'll have a great time watching this anime.

+Pro's:
-------
-The packaging looks beautifull! The cardboard sleeve is detailed and it is printed with hilarious cover-art. The 2 Disc containing  DVD cases themselves also have individual artwork on them wich I really like. Inside the cases are booklets containing a short synopsis of every episode. The artwork on the DVD's themselves is sharp and snappy.

-The image quality of the video files is very good. It's not the best out there, but It will ensure you watching the show satisfied. The same can be said for the audio quality. Not the best, but very good for normal standards.

-The menu's on the DVD's are OK; not too much stuff to confuse you with and that's good.

-100% Uncut baby!

+Con's:
-------

-There are no English subtitels embedded with the Japanese or English audio, but on the package it states that it does have these included (only for Japanese audio). I knew this when I ordered the package because I prefer the English dub over the Japanse one (so this isn't actually a con but a warning if you haven't read the other reviews already). If you, on the other hand, prefer the Japanese one, this might be a reason to not order it.

-No Kanji translation is included in the video files. It's not unwatchalble because of this, but it would be nice to have an option to turn it on or off.

-There are stationary images/pictures included between each episode. I do not see the point of this; (maybe to indicate a new episode is starting) I could have easily enjoyed this without these included. It's not that big of a deal though.

-The DVD cases feel a little fragile, but this maybe due to the fact that is has much stuff in it (2 DVD's each).

-The special feature hyped on the box isn't that special at all. Just '.pdf' files to make up for the lack of english subtitles on the Japanse audio-track. It's still nice they included these though.

----------------
Final Verdict:
----------------

This package is worth your money. The only minor complaints I have are the lack of Kanji translation and subtitles for both audio-tracks. Only the first con might be a dealbreaker for someone. But if you don't care for this, all I have left to say is: Get Up, Stand Up, and order the first part of this awesome anime!",1362355200,2,2579,4.554112554112554
5004880,5,B006MHZDSO,"Bobobo is a strange beast.  On it's face, it's a send up of Japanese adventure/action cartoons.  The plots are non-nonsensical and the characters are ridiculous.  The ""fight scenes"" are, more often than not, endless non-sequitur.  Just beneath the covers is something else, though.  The characters are dueling, with improve comedy instead of fists.  This is made slightly more clear as the series advances.  Despite the lunacy, there is some drama lurking beneath the surface.  If you like anime tropes, general weirdness, and a non-linear story line, this title might be for you.",1356048000,,580,5.228260869565218
5004881,5,B006MHZDSO,"I loved this show when it came on TV years ago, and I've been waiting for a series release ever since.  Every few months for years I've checked for Bobobo, and I was excited to finally see it in this collection.  For those of you who have never seen the show, it's a comedy as random and chaotic as it could possibly be, and it's hilarious.  I tend to watch shows in marathon, 10 or more episodes at once, but with Bobobo I can't, because afterwards my jaw literally hurts from laughing so much.  This show is just that funny.  Of course, that's only if you like the off-the-wall randomness it uses.

Though I was disappointed that the set didn't have Japanese to English subtitles, I was so happy to finally be able to watch beyond the first 10 episodes or so (where the first DVD release ended) it didn't matter to me much.  I was impressed with the quality of the set.  I don't remember the Botector looking so good when he aired on TV.  Needless to say, I definitely plan on getting the second part.",1352764800,,1003,4.320855614973262
5004882,5,B006MHZDSO,"While it lacks the Translated Subtitles, BoBoBo-Bo Bo-BoBo is STILL good for the english dubbing, and off-the-wall humor! It was a great bargain, at 38 Episodes for about the price of Illumitoon's 8 episodes (Back when they were released)! As for Subtitles, here's a tip: Download Adobe Reader to your tablet, and download the scripts to it, and you can follow the scripts to the Japanese Audio, as if it were a Second-Screen Feature on a Blu-Ray Disc. For the rest of the Series, wait patiently for the October Release of Part 2! You'll be glad that you did!",1341792000,4,559,4.656565656565657
5004883,4,B006MHZDSO,"An excellent and hilarious parody of the shounen genre, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo is an must buy. After being one of the final shows aired in the waning days of Toonami, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo finally gets a DVD release after the ill-fated Illumitoon attempt - this time with 38 episodes on this 4-disc set (10 episode on the first three, and 8 on the fourth).

The show itself stars Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo as he wanders the Earth in the year 3001.5, and fights the Chrome Dome empire with his nosehairs. He's joined by Beauty and Don Patch, as they attempt to save all the world's hair.

While this set delivers a uncut version of this show (they were kinda minor cuts, but still) than the one that aired on CN, there's also a bit of an issue. If you're fan of your anime subbed, this set features absolutely no English sub, despite early promotional materials and the very box art saying otherwise - which is strange for an anime release. It does feature a pdf version of the original scripts in the fourth disc, for whatever that's worth - and you can listen to it in Japanese.

That's a pretty bad look for S'More's first attempt at anime publishing, as despite the sets strength in the awesome dub, and excellent audio/visual quality, lack of sub will have a negative effect on sales. That said, if you can push past the subtitles issue it really is a great buy, for a hilarious series.",1339718400,2,1373,4.528225806451613
5004884,5,B006MHZDSO,"the majority of the reviews for this product are about butt hurt fans who are mad because the packaging lied about having subtitles. I will admit that yes they shouldn't have lied about the subtitles and maybe fans would not be as mad about this whole issue.

HOWEVER, NO SUBTITLES is no reason to pass up this series. Its hilarious ,goofy, and often at times makes no sense what so ever. For the price it is totally worth it even without the subtitles.

The quality of the show is great. The audio is excellent and vibrate while the animation is smooth and crystal clear. Thats why I give it a 5 out of 5. The show deserves it even if the packaging lied, and I hope this review can make up for the 500 people who gave it a 1 because it didn't have subtitles and missed out reviewing the actual show.",1336435200,5,800,4.256578947368421
5004885,1,B006MHZDSO,"Unfortunately, while S'more Entertainment considered this series worthy of pressing for DVD, they didn't consider it worthy of any significant investment beyond just dumping what was given to them onto discs. Countless amateur anime fans worldwide time and subtitle anime for free as a hobby, yet S'more Entertainment couldn't be bothered with the minimal investment necessary to add subtitles to its commercial DVD, even when they already had English translated scripts (provided as PDF files on disc 4). The minimal effort just smacks of laziness and disregard for the primary consumer audience this release is targeted at.

The show itself is enjoyable and deserves more than a one-star rating. The English dub may be passable; I don't know as I only watch movies in original langague. However, this DVD set gets only a one-star rating to help lower the average score down to a realistic and informative number.",1334534400,6,914,5.175675675675675
5004886,1,B006MHZDSO,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD RELEASE!!!!!!

I do not care how big of a fan you are of this series, I am one to.  However, the company that just released this box set released it with the English dub and the Japanese tracks.  Great news, right?  WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG!!!!  It is the Japanese track with NO subtitles, and then the company said that no subtitles track exists, so they are not doing one.  Um... did they forget they were RELEASING THIS IN AMERICA!!!!???  Whomever these bastards are need to die a quick death.  At least 4Kids is honest about not giving a damn about anime fans.  These guys are thieving crooks who need to be put out of business immediately!!!!",1334448000,6,662,4.5423728813559325
5004887,5,B006MHZDSO,I know a lot of anime fans like to watch the original japenese with english subs but trust me your missing out if you don't watch the english dub. This show is so crazy all the way through and the english voices are another reason why this anime is so great. From the stereotypes to the random phrases that will catch you by suprise and make you laugh more than anything its just makes sense to watch in english. I've been a fan of this show since it's days on Toonami and if you watch in japenese your gonna miss out on in my opinion the greatest english dub of an anime. The voice Actors really take this show up another notch and by the you'll miss out on the Bobobo rap and that is just pure genius. All in all I am just happy I own a high quality audio and video version of one of my favorite animes. Don't get discouraged by the other reviews if your new to the show for the price for 38 episodes you can't go wrong! I payed $25 for this set so that's less than a dollar an episode! Amazon really is cutting you a deal on this show.,1334361600,12,1038,4.019323671497585
5004888,1,B006MHZDSO,"I'm very disappointed in this release. I pre ordered months ago and it was listed as having English subtitles. I prefer anime with subs.
The dub for this show is good, but its radically different than the original language. Good thing its 50% off on Amazon.
I hope this company doesn't release any more anime in the future.",1334188800,7,323,4.586206896551724
5004889,1,B006MHZDSO,"I had heard great things about this show, and everything I had read up to release was that this set would have a Japanese Audio option with English subtitles. Amazon and other sites, as well as a press release stated so. I get the box in and it says they are available, so I didn't even check at first. After having people ask questions, I finally popped in the DVDs to find there were no subtitles available. There is a PDF file on the 4th disc that contains some translations, but do they expect me to read a PDF while watching the show?

S'More has come out claiming they had no intention of misleading fans, and that it was a mistake. This is not true, as press releases have said this, as well as I can find it written on the packaging about 3 times easily. They intentionally mislead fans in hope that people would overlook or forgive this omission and still enjoy the show. They basically said this in their ""apology"". Their statement claiming that most companies don't pay for subtitles is also a huge lie as ALL major anime companies at minimum do subtitles on their releases.

I have already packaged this set up to be returned to Amazon, as this was blatant false advertising to garner more sales. S'More Ent will never see me as a customer again, regardless of what properties they may license in the future. They are just not trustworthy.",1334188800,7,1351,4.487804878048781
5004890,1,B006MHZDSO,"Although the information given on for the box set claims that there are English subtitles, the DVD itself has none. The publisher claims it is because of a ""packaging error"", although I personally have my doubts. Anyways, the lack of something as basic as English subtitles on an anime DVD set is simply inexcusable, and misrepresenting that lack is just wrong. I would heartily advise against buying this DVD.",1334188800,8,410,4.956521739130435
5004891,3,B006MHZDSO,"Since so much has been said about this unusual, surreal, nonsensical series already, I'll skip right to the details of the set.

Bo-bobo has had a troubled home-video history. It was picked-up by an up-and-coming company spun-off from ADV employees who flew the coop called Illumitoon. They promised the series without the cuts it received on television and the original Japanese language track. Instead of offering a box-set of some sort, they went with singles. Volume one arrived and something was glaringly off; the subtitles were closed-caption dub-titles that followed the dub and its varying detours from the original. The dub-title track wasn't horrible per-se, but the closed-captions just didn't work. The company admitted to their mistake and began replacing discs for free that corrected this issue. Soon enough, volume two came around. Then everything went silent and it stayed that way; until now.

Illumitoon closed-up shop after putting-out a very small set of discs for two-to-three different series. Fast-forward to January 2011 and a surprise annoucement is made; Bo-bobo had been licensed rescued! S'more Entertainment pulled the series from its slumber and promised fans a complete series release in two box-sets. This was it! The series was finally getting the release it deserved; in full.

The release of set number one has come and gone earlier this week with not just joy, but confusion. Reports started coming in that the English subtitles were downright missing from the set. S'more Entertainment announced subtitles, advertised it on their online store, and slapped it on the package. Illumitoon's old release started with an issue, and this seemed to have been no different. A coincidence? Not so.

It appears mentioning of subtitles was an error on the company's part. That's right; they weren't including subtitles to accompany the Japanese language track. Instead, disc four comes with a set of translated scripts for all thirty-eight episodes in the box. S'more was not offered subtitles to go along with the set, and admitted to leaving them out because of cost reasons. My problem with this is that they passed-off the wrong information for nearly four months straight. If it wasn't going to be subtitled and you incorrectly stated it as such, fix your mistake!

That said, everything else about the box is beautiful. 38 episodes come spread on four discs with crisp artwork inside two regular-style DVD cases housed within a lightly matte-finished slipbox. Picture is crisp and bright, with minor artifacting affecting mostly on-screen text and scenes with heavy movement. The sound is clear as day and quite LOUD. (This is a plus!)

Finally, the original Japanese audio is included along with the English dub. As far as the latter goes, it's really good. I watched the whole thing when it aired on television, and found it well-cast. The translation took liberties here and there with obscure cultural stuff, but not like usual; it picked at it. And believe it or not, the joking was in the vein of the series and felt far from out of place. With this set, viewers who want to see it in the original language can do so know. But as I said before, no subtitles.

+Pros+

-Uncut!
-38 episodes
-English track
-Japanese track
-Good picture
-Good sound
-Beautiful package

+Cons+

-No subtitles
-English scripts come as .pdf extras

I'm really torn about this set. It's decked-out with the series in the way it should be, but the missing subtitles makes it hard to recommend. My issue lies more with how the licensor handled their issues and continues to do so. Had I known before hand, I would have had time to think about watching the series raw or printing-out the enclosed scripts to follow-along with. For those who don't care, you have no reason to skip this at such a great price. For those who do, think about it first long and hard.

Either way, the series has finally come close to getting the release it deserves. It has on literally every single front, but the falsely-advertised issue can make or break it in the eye of the beholder.",1334188800,15,4079,4.964809384164223
5004892,4,B006MHZDSO,"First, be aware that there are no subtitles. S'more Entertainment has said that there was miscommunication and there were never supposed to be subtitles. This is a pretty bad screw-up, especially considering it claims there are subtitles right on the box.

Also, if you plan on viewing these using a PS3, be aware you may come across issues trying to boot the DVDs, usually the second time. To get around this, you can highlight the DVD in the XMB, press triangle, and select ""Play From Beginning"".

Everything the five star reviews say about the series is true though, and the English dub is great.",1334188800,4,599,4.75
5004893,1,B006MHZDSO,"Be aware that the packaging is a lie and there are no subtitles on this DVD set!
I would never support a company that flat-out lies to its customers.",1334188800,6,149,4.172413793103448
5004894,3,B006MHZDSO,"First off, I love this show. It is a great gag comedy with shonen anime fun, and I'm glad its finally getting a more thorough release than in the past. The transfer is good, audio clear, and a pretty solid dub track (I've heard better, but I've heard many not up to this quality).
My big problem, however, is the lack of an English subtitle track. The package says its there, and the publisher has come forward admiting the mistake. Did they admit an accidental omission of the track? No. They admitted the error of stating it on the package. A dub-only release isn't unheard of (it was the only way to get Rave Master), and the show wasn't edited (at least not anything I've noticed), but the inclusion of a Japanese audio track WITHOUT an English subtitle track seems like a slap in the face, especially when the original press release for the series stated it would be a sub/dub release.

Quoting from Anime News Network:
[...]
While both Japanese and English language audio tracks are available on the release, Amy Schorr, President of S'more Entertainment stated: ""The episodes were never available in a sub-titled format and neither TOEI [nor] S'more could justify the cost of creating new versions of the series. DVD sales have plummeted to the point where most companies wouldn't be willing to commit the money needed for packaging [and] authoring, but we felt the series was important enough to justify any risk.""

Many companies are ""willing to commit the money"" to put out physical DVDs, and some successfuly with mostly subtitle-only versions (Section 23, for example). I would think a new company (this is the first anime release from S'more Ent.) would try harder to please the fans. I'm not asking for a huge, killer special edition, I just want what is promised to me.",1334102400,31,1784,4.751612903225807
5004895,5,B006MHZDSO,"This Collection has 38 Episodes on 4 Discs. I was expecting the quality of the video to be bad for having 10 episodes per disc for the first 3 and 8 episodes on the 4th, but it's really not that bad. The Collection seems to viewable in English 2.0 or Japanese 2.0 Audio but there aren't any subtitles.

The Anime is so whacky and crazy that doesn't make much sense, but I still can't help but to watch it. It isn't the type of show that everyone will watch and think of as a 5 Star Anime, but the only way to know if you'll enjoy this series is to see it. Most people in my family enjoy it, but I've met others that complained that it was extremely stupid.

Other animes could take a lesson from this, specifically I mean shows like Bleach where you get like 11 or 12 episodes for 30 to 40 dollars. Give us more episodes for less money just as they have done with this show. This is a great show that will keep you laughing throughout its entirety.
