8295855,1,B001E0MNMS,"I purchased this Discovery Channel item hoping to get some insights into the native Trobriand Culture, not knowing what ""Last One Standing"" really meant.  Well, the whole premise is, a bunch of Western muscle-men -- some obviously pumped-up on steroids -- go out and kick the arses of smaller aboriginals and other tribal cultures competing in their various native games.  I suppose some will enjoy that.  Nice to see the shorter and more naturally-muscular Mongolian guys thrash the Big Boys of the Hollywood madhouse.  But as far as the Trobriands are concerned, it did reveal how badly they were tarnished and degenerated by decades of contact with Western missionaries and other aspects of our sex-repressive culture.  Only some remnants of the original culture were apparent as one might see from the writings of the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sexual-Life-of-Savages/dp/0807046078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sexual Life of Savages</a>.  Some of the native dress and dance appears as it was in the past times, and of course this was titillating for the repressed muscle-boys -- no females appear to accompany them on their round-the-world excursions, so their sex-starvation in the face of nearly naked women was apparent.  But the Trobriands were once a very peaceful place, the ""Islands of Love"" in past centuries, who only had weapons to defend themselves from the very rare violent raiders from the distant western regions of New Guinea.  Now they suffer from missionaries, play soccer and cricket, and have occasional violent clashes with neighboring villages which, in the past, they exchanged goods and had regular romantic liasons coming and going among the young people.  The phallic dances of the men before and during the cricket match also do not jive with the softer sexuality described by Malinowski, but without comparative films it is difficult to say.  What is apparent is, everything shown in this film on the Trobriands now has a hard edge to it.  They seemed more at home with a spear and shield, than with flowers and flutes, which was the former situation.  Bottom Line:  If you want to see the worst of Western narcissistic muscle-men strutting their stuff, recounting in excessive detail about how they got this or that bruise or cut, and were all plotting to ""win"" against everyone else, posturing in full vainglory before the cameras, get this DVD.  If you want some view of Trobriand life and culture, get this only for a sad commentary on how they degenerated away from what once was a paradise.  Amazing also to see the big cautionary warning at the start of this DVD, like a cancer warning on a pack of cigs, that you were about to see bare-breasted women, so quickly chase all the kids out of the room -- even National Geographic never carried such loud disclaimers against the naked human form.",1292198400,,2922,5.213675213675214
