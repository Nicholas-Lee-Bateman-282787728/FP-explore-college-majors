965325,1,6305112878,Period piece mentioned in Trump Fire and Fury book. Offensive on almost every level. Strong Jewish undertones reminiscent of the tragic sufferings of the Jews during World War II and doubly sad because written and performed by Jewish actors.,1516406400,,241,5.205128205128205

Mel is right... you gotta laugh at the crazies and the nuts who are out to ruin the country and the world... unfortunately laughing at our new crazy, drumpf, may mean wrecking the country while we laugh at his craziness... let's hope someone like Mel can write as great a play/movie about the new fool, as his wonderful stooge steve, as Mel did about the earlier nazi.",1490832000,3,616,4.184873949579832

966202,1,6305112878,"For quite a few years watching this film had been on my bucket list. I had heard of the paradoxical plot line, and it struck me as quite funny per se. Now that I've finally got around to seeing it, it turns out that the basic plot was the only thing funny about it. Well, that's putting it too weakly because it wasn't just the lack of humor that bothered me, it was how incredibly annoying the whole spectacle was. The opening scene was intertwined with the credits, and it was a toe-curling experience. Always the optimist, I thought that once that was over, the characters would gain just a little bit of dignity and let the story, with its inherent comedy, take over. No such luck. It seems as though every scene was dominated by one of more people acting out their neuroses in shouting, whining, or aggressive actions. I made it through that brutal assault on my senses, but only by a sheer act of will.
The ""acting"" does not deserve that designation; anyone can over-act, and over-acting is all that the viewer can see in this film.
An earlier reviewer has remarked that the current version of the film is not as good as the original due to heavy cutting for television consumption. Be that as it may, I can only react to what is available for me to see. Perhaps the ending would have made a little more sense if there had been more of the previous scenes, but I can't believe that the trade-off would have been worth it. No  further prolongation of this abysmal coil of celluloid could possibly have improved it.",1473120000,3,1519,4.4640287769784175

966340,4,6305112878,"As I make my way through Mel Brooks' filmography, I am constantly reminded of how funny he is. I mean, who else would think of making a movie about two Broadway producers who make a musical about Hitler? I laughed so much it hurt. Of course, my head often hurt for other reasons too. Gene Wilder, while quite hilarious himself, frequently got on my nerves with his manic episodes. It was funny the first couple of times, but it annoyed me afterwards. The true star of the film was Dick Shawn, who played the lead actor in the musical 'Springtime for Hitler.' He was such a pleasure to watch. Overall, I would say this is one of the more straightforwardly comedic Mel Brooks films. I certainly laughed more consistently than with his other ones.

This in part motivated me to compose this review.  I think it needs to be said that the screen writer, Mel Brooks, one of my favorites, comes from a Jewish tradition.  I am quite positive there is no intention to offend people of the Jewish faith.  But Jeepers!!

This movie is so ""off the hook"" that I am almost afraid to say how much I like it.  The only easy comparison I can make is to the writing of Flannery O'Connor.  Mel Brooks has had a great, lengthy career.  But this may be his greatest work.  He did receive an academy award for it.

Gene Wilder arrives at his office to examine his financial records, and notes that he had embezzled some money from his previous production...but this didn't matter as that production lost all its money anyway. Soon, the two of them hit upon a clever idea-make a theater production that is sure to flop, and they can embezzle all the money they can without fear of consequences!

To do that, the pair seek out the worst play, ""Springtime For Hitler"" by a crazed Nazi, worst director, a stereotypical flaming homosexual, and worst actor from an audition, a goofy hippie. Of course, the audience will hate it, right?

The movie depends on a shocking concept, and only a Jew would have dared to pull it off. Performances and stereotypes are overdone, but that is part of the comedy.

966496,5,6305112878,"A truly great, classic American comedy, full of insanely funny scenes, wonderful and way over the top, but never out of control performances, and a really clever central idea.

Max (Zero Mostel) is a down on his luck Broadway producer who's been reduced to seducing little old ladies in the hope of conning them out of enough money to stay afloat.  One day a young accountant named Leo (Gene Wilder) comes to audit his books, and trips into the theoretic discovery that one could make a ton of money by wildly overselling the shares of a show, and then having the show be a flop.  Who would audit and see that you sold 10,000% of the profits if its a disaster?  To Max, this sounds like a genius idea to try, and he enlists the super-neurotic, hysterical Leo in a quest to find the world's worst play they can be sure will bomb. (Because, if it doesnt, theyll end up in jail for fraud).

This leads them to a little ditty called Springtime for Hitler -- a love poem of a play to the Fuhrer from a fully insane Nazi hiding in New York City.  While Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder - both quite brilliant - got most of the attention as the odd couple of producers, Kenneth Mars' performance as the Nazi playwright is one of the greatest comic characters Ive ever seen.  Multiple viewings have failed to dampen his ability to reduce me to tears of laughter.

Without going through the rest of the plot, suffice it to say this just goes from highlight to highlight, and is crammed full of brilliant performances in even the smallest roles.  The 5 minute 'auditions for Hitler' montage has more laughs than most good comedies have in their whole running time.  A triumph of an insane, absurd first film for Mel Brooks - and the years have done little to dim it's brilliance.",1461196800,4,1764,4.450310559006211

It can be watched many times before picking up all the witty references and subtle nuances. So, funny script, funny directing, and very funny performances from everyone concerned. The social satire wit of Saturday Night Live, before there WAS a Saturday Night Live. So successful, socially and comedically influential, that it is one of the few non-musical movies to generate a Broadway Musical, which then generated its own Musical Movie, about the same story with the same name...Again!

967409,5,6305112878,"I love this movie. It is the classic tale of excessively bad being exceedingly good, and the problems that come from it. Just HOW bad, is complicated by the movie's age. When it was released in 1967, World War 2 was just far enough away to be a subject of comedy, but close enough to be feasible that the play's author could be portrayed as someone who could have known Hitler. His reactions and subsequent actions are key plot points that would be impossible today, A Dick Shawn's beat/flower-child was perfect...at that time. Much of the depths of humor in his portrayal is lost today. When it was released, it truly captured the absurdities of SO many aspects of society at that point in time. Many of the conflicts just don't ring true today. Whether for good or ill, we have evolved as a society. The portrayal of gays as a point. While almost enlightened at the time, it is offensive today. But if taken for what it is, a snapshot of an industry and time, it is amazing. The chemistry between Mostel and Wilder is magic. I saw this movie when it first came out, and have watched it many times since.  If my comments about it seem negative, it is because as I see the reactions of my children and grandchildren, I feel a bit of nostalgic sadness at the things they cannot relate to.",1453507200,,1287,4.430379746835443

There are so many hilarious moments in this movie -- I've often believed that it's not only unique in comedy annals, it's the single best answer to neo-Nazi adherents.

968403,5,6305112878,"Outstanding deluxe DVD set features an interesting (and very amusing) introduction to the film that started the ball rolling that would make a name for Mel Brooks in cinema--it also houses interviews with the resigned Gene Wilder, the irreprisable comic genius Kenneth Mars (what a unique actor he is), and Brooks himself, all of whom explain the challenges and joys of getting ""The Producers"" on film. I have not watched--and will not watch--the new version of ""The Producers"" (there's a trailer here that reveals the obvious attempts at humor and over the top performances of both Lane and Broderick) because for my money no one can top what Wilder and Mostel have done here, now preserved for the ages on this nice new DVD set. It is easy to see why Brooks's unorthodox sense of humor didn't catch on right away; even now, the Nazis remain difficult fictional subjects for some people to deal with. What Brooks has actually contributed to cinema history is difficult to gauge realistically: there's ""The Elephant Man"", ""The Doctor and the Devils"", ""The Fly"", and there's also ""Blazing Saddles""...Brooks may be more useful as a producer than a director, but who cares in terms of evaluating his early work? These older movies are more sophisticated and far less idiot in their comedy than today's travesties, but times change, I guess...
Good quality of picture and sound on these discs, and it's nice to have a copy of this in a newer Widescreen transfer. It may not be to your taste, but the original film ""The Producers"" is both funny and pointed in its plot (I keep thinking that Brooks lifted this plot from either a literary or filmic source, but maybe I'm wrong?).

968642,3,6305112878,"This is good mainly as an education as to the reason to get the one with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
It was the first one Mel Brooks directed, having created it and the music.
Brooks is unquestionably a  multi-talented man whose humor seems to reside at age one-and one-half,  and to us it is worthwhile only in the essence of where he headed with the next production.
The second production, with different actors (Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick) brings not only splendid talent, which Wilder and Zero Mostel also possess, but Brooks moved up the pace and magnified everything.
The content is really riotously funny when you realize what a freed-up age we now live in and can look back and find humor in frightening things.  But, it is important to not forget about the reality behind the spoof.
In addition to the horrors that WWII represents - in degradation and suppression and destruction of entire countries. and where the whole thing was headed once people did nothing in time and then the momentum took it to levels impossible to eradicate.
A lot of people who are tremendously talented, have a very different lifestyle from those of us who just plod through a regular life, I suppose it might be viewed.
Dick Shawn was perfect for the part as he had limitless skills as a stand-up comedian.  But, the whole thing is slooooow-paced and left out a whole lot that was in the stage-play.

GUYS AND DOLLS is the story of Nathan Detroit's (Frank Sinatra) dispossessed floating crapgame and his G-note ""sucker bet"" that Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) won't be able to convince missionary Sgt. Sarah Brown (Jean Simmns) to accompany him to Havana. If Nathan wins, he's richer by a grand and can pay a garage owner for the use of his storeroom.

If he loses the wager, Sister Sara will be out of town and the game can float right into her mission. Either way Detroit stands to win, if not for his longtime girlfriend, Miss Adelaide. She made Nathan swear to give up gambling, a vow he has no more intention of keeping than he does a 14 year promise to marry the showgirl. Meanwhile, dapper Sky tries all he can to ingratiate himself with straitlaced Sister Sara, but he doesn't seem to be making any progress.

In typical Broadway style, there's several show-stopping numbers here: ""Adelaide's Lament,"" ""Luck Be a Lady,"" the title song and ""Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat,"" delivered grandly by Mr. Kaye. Other cast members: Robert Keith (Lt. Brannigan) and Sheldon Leonard (Harry the Horse).

.
In THE PRODUCERS (1968), Mel Brooks has a cameo as an auditioner decked out in a WWI-era German uniform, complete with spiked helmet. His nifty rendition of ""Have You Ever Heard the German Band?"" is cut interrupted by a loud ""THANK YOU!"" Here's what he sings before being cut off:

Haben sie gehort das Deutsche Band
Mit a bang
Mit a boom
Mit a bing-bang bing-bang boom
Aaah, haben sie gehort das Deutsche Band
Mit a bang
Mit a boom
Mit a (THANK YOU!)...bing..bang...bing....(frown)

FILM SYNOPSIS--
Once-successful Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) convinces mousy accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) to go in with him on a scheme to defraud investors out of a million dollars. All that's necessary is to find the worst possible script, director and cast, and Bialystock & Bloom's new play will close on opening night, then they'll exts stage south to Rio de Janiero.

""Springtime For Hitler,"" by kooky ex-Reichsman Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) is the perfect vehicle, fey crossdressing director Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewlitt) seems most likely to fail and a company headed by spaced out Lorenzo St. DuBois aka L.S.D (Dick Shawn) won't be a smash, but a smash-up. The only hitch: an opening night crowd LOVES the show-- it'll play for years! As Leo lists the dozens of backers invested at 50% or more, Max wonders: WHAT WENT RIGHT?

""The Producers"" is truly a comedy classic, with an outstanding cast and THE MOST outrageous chorus line theme song you will ever, ever see. Very highest recommendation for a movie that will ""run for years,"" and to Mssrs. Bialystock & Bloom: worse luck NEXT time, boys!",1397433600,3,5065,6.488888888888889

From the endlessly funny mind of filmmaker Mel Brooks comes this triple-Oscar winning explosion of pure comic lunacy about low-rent Broadway producer Max Bialystock [Zero Mostel] and his high-strung accountant Leo Bloom [Gene Wilder]. They discover that, with the help of a few gullible investors, they can make more money on a flop than on a hit. So armed with the worst show ever written ""Springtime For Hitler"" and an equally horrific cast, this double-dealing duo is banking on disaster. But when their sure-to-offend musical becomes a surprise smash hit, they find themselves in the middle of a Broadway blitzkrieg!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Producers is considered by many to be one of the top comedies of all time; this 1968 film ranked at number eleven on the American Film Institute's list of the top one hundred comedies. The film, which has grown to cult status, is noteworthy for a number of reasons: first, it marked Mel Brooks' directorial film debut and first attempt at writing for the big screen and directing. Unexpectedly, it also marked Mel Brooks' first Oscar nomination and win for the award that we now call Best Original Screenplay. 'The Producers' is a unique comedy that has never been equalled. Here we have Max Bialystock is a failing Broadway producer who has been reduced to wearing a cardboard belt and taking money from elderly women in exchange for fulfilling their sexual fantasies. His luck changes for the better when he meets Leo Bloom, a neurotic accountant who inadvertently gives him an idea of how to turn failure into fortune and solicit a huge financial investment for a play, produce a guaranteed flop, and pocket the investors' money. Armed with Springtime for Hitler, the worst play they can find, Max and Leo set out to conquer Broadway, by closing in one night.

The two leading characters were inspired by real events in Mel Brooks' life. At one point early in his career, Mel Brooks was the assistant to a scamming stage producer who would sleep with older wealthy women in exchange for them supplying funds for his productions. In 'The Producers,' this adaptation of Mel Brooks' former boss is the sexual businessman played by Zero Mostel. He's a grand, energetic and wildly zany character. I cannot think of another actor, past or present, which could pull off the physicality and non-stop intensity of Zero Mostel. Like many comedic stage actors, his actions and reactions are over-exaggerated, but adding balance to the potentially exhausting high energy of his character, Max Bialystock, is the calm fish-out-of-water bookkeeper that gets seduced into Max Bialystock's dishonest lifestyle, Leo Bloom. Of course, this is the role that landed Gene Wilder in comedic motion pictures. The only silver screen production that he had appeared in prior to 'The Producers' was 'Bonnie and Clyde.' With Leo being a mostly restrained and reserved character, there are moments that Max Bialystock pushes Leo Bloom's anxiety and break him out of his quiet shell. These instances offer the comedic brilliance that allows for Gene Wilder to leave behind the straight man persona and conjure hearty ""belly-laughs"" from the audience.

As well-written as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom are and as perfect as Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are, and these pairings wouldn't be worth a dime if it wasn't for a great screenplay for them to exist within. Their character types are a great combination, but it's the scenario that they place themselves in that truly makes 'The Producers' a ""perfect storm"" of comedy.

When Leo Bloom is brought into Max Bialystock's office to help with bookkeeping, he notices a $2,000 error in the books. Max Bialystock's last production was a total flop. It came nowhere near profiting, so there wasn't the hassle of having to repay all of the investors; however, there were $2,000 left over from the production's budget. Being a conscious-less blood-sucking businessman, Max Bialystock persuades Leo Bloom into ""cooking the books"" and placing the $2,000 straight into Max Bialystock's pocket. Not having worked in show business until this moment, Leo Bloom notices a quick way that any dishonest producer could scam millions: if a producer pulled in millions of dollars from investors, didn't spend it all on the production and produced a sure-fire flop, then he could become an instant millionaire by cooking the books. It takes plenty of coaxing, but Leo proves to be a corruptible accountant and signs on to be Max Bialystock's producing partner for their soon-to-be musical flop, ""Springtime for Hitler.""

Watching Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom intentionally sabotage their show is hilarious. From a pro-Hitler playwright and a horrible director to downright awful actors and Nazi propaganda musical numbers, their self-destruction is absolutely entertaining, making 'The Producers' one of the funniest comedies of all time.

The Producers also established many of the Mel Brooks trademarks that would be seen in his films to come. A wacky and often twisted sense of humour that was shocking to some at the time was part of Mel Brookss repertoire. Who else could make a film about two Jewish men putting on a play called ""Springtime for Hitler""? Incidentally, that was one of Mel Brookss favourite running jokes before he made this film. When asked what his next project would be, he would often say that he was going to do a musical called ""Springtime for Hitler."" Because of the musical scenes, the film was banned in Germany. It later made its appearance in that country in a film festival featuring the works of Jewish filmmakers. Mel Brookss sense of humour was recognised at the Academy Awards that year when he received the Oscar for Best Screenplay, his only Oscar to date. Mel Brooks would later produce a musical version for the Broadway stage that became a long-running hit starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick; they recreated their roles for the 2005 film version directed by Susan Stroman.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The 1080p transfer compressed using the AVC codec retains the films theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and has never looked better. Colours are well-saturated and consistent, blacks are inky while retaining much of the detail, and film grain is left virtually intact. The print used does have a few minor nicks and dirt debris here and there, and some shots, usually optical are somewhat soft. All in all, though, a near-perfect transfer for a 40+ year old film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Producers contains two English soundtracks, a 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio (replicating the films original theatrical presentation) and a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio remix. Both sound very good, and have been cleaned up quite nicely by removing a lot of the noise inherent in earlier video releases. The LPCM Mono Audio is clear and clean throughout, while the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio opens up the soundstage a bit by expanding the music to the left, right, and surrounds, while directing dialogue and effects to the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Documentary: The Making of 'The Producers' [480i] [63:23] This lengthy and in-depth feature serves as a true documentary, walking you through the entire process of how 'The Producers' came to be, how it was shot, how it was distributed and how it became an Oscar-winning film. There's an abundance of interviews and clips, all of which are great.

Special Feature: Mel and His Movies: 'The Producers' [1080p] [18:52] This feature is a fluid interview-like session with Mel Brooks. He discusses nearly everything shown in the 'Making of' feature, only in a compressed and abbreviated fashion.

Deleted Scene [480i] [3:41] The 'Making of' feature shows snippets and references an alternate version of how the duo tries to destroy the theatre. Watch the full version of this alternate scene here. Mel Brooks says that this scene was changed because the comedic timing doesn't work and, after watching it, I have to agree.

Special Feature: Peter Sellers' Ad in 'Variety' [480i] [0:53) Peter Sellers' raving one-paragraph review is read to the camera during an interview. Mel Brooks references this quote in Mel and His Movies and the story behind it is explained in the 'Making of.'

Special Feature: Sketch Gallery [480i] [2:15] Watch a slideshow set to music that shows dozens of different artistic depictions of the events and locations in the film.

Theatrical Trailers: The Producers [480i] [2:12]; American Masters' Mel Brooks: Make a Noise [480i] [1:51] and The Incredible Mel Brooks: An Irresistible Collection of Unhinged Comedy [480i] [2:30].

BONUS: Shout! Factory has given 'The Producers' a two-disc release that includes a Region A/1 [only] Blu-ray disc and a NTSC DVD copy of the film. The discs are housed in a standard double Amaray case that reveals a fun little secret and the cover art is reversible so that you can remove the sheet and flip it over for a completely different cover. The art on the inside of the case remains the same, but the front cover art is different.

Finally, considering the fact that 'The Producers' was made in the late 1960s, it's crazy to see the risqu&eacute; jokes and gags (including pasties-covered nude breasts and geriatric foreplay) Mel Brooks gets away with in it. Mel Brooks hit the ground running with this comedy about an unlikely duo planning a million-dollar scam disguised as a Broadway flop. The boundary-pushing sexuality is matched by comically playing with taboo topics regarding Hitler and the Holocaust. The comedic timing of its leading duo is perfect, never missing a beat. The final punchline of the movie is unforgettable, so much so that it's been used and referenced in many black comedies since then. The transfer of this 45-year-old film is not flawless, but strong nonetheless. More special features exist than I expected, including an hour-plus documentary about 'The Producers.' If you are a Mel Brooks fan that was disappointed in 'The Producers' not being included in 'The Mel Brooks Collection,' then be excited for this Blu-ray because it's just as good and if not better than the discs in that set. Again this has been an all-time favourite film of Mel Brooks and despite its age, still holds up well and the comedy is still relevant today, but I personally was very sad that the Blu-ray Cover could not be the design as was the brilliant The Criterion Collection NTSC LaserDisc Cover, as it was totally perfect. Also why won't Mel Brooks release his latest The Producers film musical, as this would be a brilliant companion to this particular Blu-ray Disc, so hopefully one day Mel Brooks will get his act together, as it would be a massive hit with all Mel Brooks fans of this comedy genius. Despite this, I am still honoured to have this in my Mel Brooks Blu-ray Collection and if you have never seen this film, well you will be in for a total hilarious [stomach aching] treat. Highly Recommended!

If you don't know it already, Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of a DVD title together whether it is standard def or Blu-ray and so it is important, when looking at reviews to note the format being reviewed. It is most helpful to sort the reviews by ""most recent first"" (Amazon gives you this option). If you look at the ""most helpful review"" for this title, you will see it is from 2006 and is not the Bluray. If you are purchasing a new title, look at the date.

That said, I can't write as technical review of the BD as my fellow reviewer Marty Gillis so I'll defer to him on the technical aspects. I'll try to add other info here.
The new 2013 Bluray (from Shout Factory) provides the same bonus features as the earlier standard def reissue: Sketch Gallery, One deleted scene, and a wonderful 61-minute (!) ""Making of..."" documentary with lots of info. The only new bonus is the 20-minute ""Mel and His Movies"" segment. This is one of the newly produced mini-docs that was made for (and included in ) the FABULOUS Mel Brooks DVD compilation that SF issued last year (and which is a ""must have"" for all Brooks fans.).  So, if you have that set, and the earlier standard DVD of ""The Producers"", there's nothing new here. BUT, if you have a high-def TV and love the film as much as the rest of we Brooks fans, you will definitely want to see the Blu-ray.

With 270+ other reviews here - I don't need to re-hash the plot, etc. I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

969061,4,6305112878,"My favorite comedy film ever, and one of the best movies of any kind that I've ever seen.  Gotta view it once a year, at least!

Worthy (easily) of 5 stars for the movie itself, but the weak blu ray quality (reviewed later, below) makes it 4 stars for the blu ray version. This film is the greatest, most clever comedy that I've ever seen, by far.  Zero Mostel steals the show.  He simply OWNS his character, Max Bialystock, forever.  Wilder is great, in his first-ever movie role, as his accountant Leo Bloom, and rarely has there been ANY woman in a movie as beautiful and sexy as Lee Meredith (playing Ulla).  Dick Shawn as L.S.D., the fellow cast in the ""role"" of Hitler in the hopefully ill-fated play produced by Max and Leo, is the funniest ""inept hippie"" you ever saw.  Kenneth Mars is unbeatable as the play's (""Springtime for Hitler"") bizarre, unrepentant Nazi-but-still funny author, Franz Liebkind.

(NONE of these accolades applies in the slightest to the poor, unnecessary re-make with Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, and Uma Thurman, who are ALL poor substitutes for the originals.)

P.S. - Oddly, and fortunately, of all the DVD movies I own, both the Special Edition and 2-disc Deluxe Edition versions of ""The Producers"" (yes, the 1968 original version) look GREAT on my 55"" HD TV--with sharp focus and vibrant color--unlike most every other DVD I have.  Nearly every other regular DVD's picture quality looks weak in HD, and thus a blu ray version is a necessity.  But since the regular DVD version of ""The Producers"" looks so good, yes, even on HD TVs, I hope the blu ray is truly an improvement.  As Shout! Factory is releasing the blu ray, my hopes are not high at all.  They messed up the remastering of ""All In The Family"" Season 7, causing the picture to look like film or British PAL, with out-of-sync voices vs. lips as well, and they refuse to correct the MAJOR picture/sound-sync problems in that set.

UPDATE (7/13/13):

Well, now that I own this very expensive ($19.00) blu ray (""BR""), I have to say I'm disappointed. The blu ray only merits the 4 stars I gave it due to the great movie itself.  Because the picture quality is only barely--microscopically-- better than that of the Special Edition DVD, when comparing BOTH at the same time on my very sharp 55"" 2013 HD TV. (As I'd noted above, the DVD's picture is amazingly sharp when played on my HD TV, better than most other DVDs).  The problem is, the AGE of the picture really shows through, still, on the BR--you get more defects and flaws than with the DVD, but the BR has only a hair sharper and more vivid a picture. Yet the blu ray also has the flesh tones looking way too red throughout the entire film, as if the characters are sunburned (as noted by another Amazon reviewer).

In fact, the DVD's picture is actually ""cleaner"" than the BR's, whose sharpness just reveals more flaws than on the DVD, but not any more details such as lines in one's face or sharper graphics (such as the credits).  For only the 3rd time in over 100 blu ray purchases, I say, for the money, get the Special Edition DVD and not the Blu ray--all of the best extra features on the BR were already on the DVD.  (By far the best of these is the ""Making of"" documentary, included on all three: the blu ray, the special Ed., and the Deluxe Ed.)

The BR has one nice thing as to the picture--it generally plays at between 30-36 Mbpm, a fine, high bit rate for a BR.  But it's bringing through a ""Not-Cleaned-Up At All"" picture.  Earlier movies available on blu ray, such as 1965's ""Goldfinger"" and ""The Battle of the Bulge,"" are MUCH ""newer""-looking, sharper-looking, AND ""cleaner""-looking, than ""The Producers"" blu ray.

Sometimes, esp. around 2006, a BR comes out that is too clean, as it has of the ALL grain and flaws smoothed out of it--such was the case with the first release of ""Patton,"" which still looked gorgeous. After many complaints were issued, that BR was remastered, to show some grain, plus even more detail, and so as to be even more lifelike--and it's amazing-looking.  And STILL retains a ""clean"" look, too.  Unfortunately, nothing done to ""The Producers"" blu ray accomplished improving ANY of these qualities--it is a bit weak in all these respects, not even close in quality to the first, inferior BR release of ""Patton.""  And this 1968 film is only a year or so newer than 1970's ""Patton,"" as Patton was shot in 1969.  Doubtless, a great master for ""The Producers"" doesn't exist, and the one used was a little worn.

As this is one of my favorite pics of all time, it is a big disappointment.  I read Marty Gillis's enthusiastic Amazon review, which made me purchase this BR (not at Amazon, for a change!), but I cannot agree as to wonderful picture quality.  It simply looks OLD, and not as in-focus as it could be--easily noticed during the opening and closing credits, which are no more sharp than on the DVD.  (Ok, I would have bought this BR without reading any reviews, as I love the movie that much.)

Is this the best picture quality to be had for ""The Producers"" (1968) so far?  Yes, it is.  But it's just barely, microscopically, better than the Special Edition DVD.  Again, I compared the BR against the Spec. ed. on the same day, one after the other and then repeating the comparison. The BR is barely sharper/more vivid, but less clean. And at $19.00, this is several times the price vs. a new Spec. Ed. DVD.

One other weird thing: when the menu is displayed, a version of ""Springtime for Hitler"" plays that you NEVER hear in the actual movie-- a lousy, thin version (as to the voices AND the music), probably an outtake version.  Moreover, the menu itself (esp. at scene selection) is VERY slow and unresponsive to your clicks on the remote control, such that it makes you skip past and miss the item you were trying to point at before the click.  A problem that I've never experienced on any other blu ray or DVD (and I own over a thousand . . .)

Beyond what I've noted, there are no ""major problems"" at all beyond an old-looking, not finely-focused picture.  98 out of 100 BR's from this period are sharp as a tack on my HD TV, just not this film, ""The Great Escape"" (1963), or ""All The President's Men"" (1976).  Everything else on BR from this period is great!

I'm no fan of Shout Factory!  Their refusal to re-master ""All In The Family's"" 7th season, which they screwed up the picture on ROYALLY to the complaints of many viewers, had already soured me on them as to how they do business and their lack of pride. (I was one of several people who Shout! Factory had told directly, ""No, we won't re-do it."")  So ""The Producers"" blu ray is another disappointment from these people.

Together, they set up a scheme to create a production that will surely fail, thus leaving them with all the money that has been raised by Mostel.

I should warn you that after the first viewing few people that I've known feel, as I do, that The Producers is a comedy masterpiece (and Mel Brooks' best work) but in time most have watched it again and then again until they too are reciting lines from the movie.

The cast is wonderful but Zero Mostel (Max Bialystock) and Gene Wilder (Leo Bloom) are brilliant with a chemistry rarely matched.  Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn and Lee Meredith (amongst others) are memorable.

Max is an over-the-top, formerly successful Broadway Producer who is reduced to 'wearing cardboard belts' and 'seducing' little old ladies to raise cash for plays that invariably fail.  Leo is a timid, neurotic accountant who is sent to do Maxs' books.

Leo hypothesizes that a failed play can, under the right circumstances, be more profitable than a flop since no one takes looks at the finainces because there aren't any profits.  Max loves the idea and tries to convince Leo to join him in finding the perfect flop but only succeeds in traumatizing him.

Leo finally relents and they find the perfect play, a sure to close in one night failure, Springtime For Hitler: A Gay Romp With Adolph and Eva at Berchtesgaden.

Having found the 'right' play they set out to get the permission of the author, Franz Leipkind (Kenneth Mars), find the worst director, the worst actors and sell thousands of percent of the plays profits to little old ladies.

Brooks turned The Producers into a successful Broadway play and a movie version of the play followed starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.

Gene Wilder is a perfect foil for him, clutching his blue blanky while Bialystock(an absurd monicker, obviously from the head of Mel Brooks)manipulates him in stentorian tones.  The movie ridicules the absurdity of theatrical people, and in this way, Brooks achieves additional humor through subtle self-deprecation.  The tastelessness of the production in question is so completely outrageous that Brooks gets away with might have been considered anti-semitic self-flagellation.  It reminds one of the Seinfeld episode when the comment, ""not that there's anything wrong with it,"" allowed the writers to suggest impropiety in the homosexual lifestyle at a time when such a message was politically incorrect.
  ""The Producers"" is probably more intelligent than Brooks ever intended it to be, but that is to the benefit of all who see it.  On any level it is a laugh out loud experience to see both for the content of the story and the talent of the cast.",1260403200,,1077,5.114285714285714
969405,5,6305112878,"Mel Brooks made a typically noisy directorial debut with this joyously insane comedy which dares to affront its audiences with crookedness & crassness. I imagine by the way this film comes across, it made quite an impact with 1968 audiences, and its loony storyline continues to entertain audiences today (i.e., the smash Broadway musical & its film adaptation). Brooks originally intended it as a novel, but then it just didn't work out, and the piece morphed from stage play to screenplay. Lucky for us!
The pairing of the late Zero Mostel & screen newcomer Gene Wilder was a casting match made in heaven. No one goes into hysterics quite like Wilder, and Mostel is a wondrous force of nature who blows through the picture. The two played off each other beautifully. The great comic actors Kenneth Mars & the late Dick Shawn were nothing less than perfection in their roles of the nutty German playwright & the hippie-ish actor L.S.D., miscast (on purpose) as Hitler, respectively (the latter's audition selection of the song ""Love Power"" is really something else). And the shots of stunned, shocked faces of the audience during the ""Springtime for Hitler"" opener is an unforgettable comedy moment.
I saw the recent Nathan Lane-Matthew Broderick starring remake of ""The Producers"" movie, so it was interesting to compare the two films. My opinion? The latter is a more fully realized production from the original. But few films can match the sheer comic energy of the original. It remains an offbeat classic, an indication that Brooks was just beginning to unleash his comic talents on us...fortunately!",1257379200,,1605,5.037593984962406

FILM SYNOPSIS--
Once-successful Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Mostel) convinces mousy accountant Leo Bloom (Wilder) to go in with him on a scheme to defraud investors out of a million dollars. All that's necessary is to find the worst possible script, director and cast, and Bialystock & Bloom's new play will close on opening night, then they'll exts stage south to Rio de Janiero.

""Springtime For Hitler,"" by kooky ex-Reichsman Franz Liebkind (Mars) is the perfect vehicle, fey crossdressing director Roger De Bris (Hewlitt) seems most likely to fail and a company headed by spaced out Lorenzo St. DuBois aka L.S.D (Shawn) won't be a smash, but a smash-up. The only hitch: an opening night crowd LOVES the show-- it'll play for years! As Leo lists the dozens of backers invested at 50% or more, Max wonders: WHAT WENT RIGHT?

""The Producers"" is truly a comedy classic, with an outstanding cast and THE MOST outrageous chorus line theme song you will ever, ever see. Very hghest recommendation for a movie that will ""run for years,"" and to Mssrs. Bialystock & Bloom: worse luck NEXT time, boys!

Classic performances by Gene Wilder, Zero Mostel and Dick Shaun make this film, which enjoyed a sort of cult classic following until they made it into a Broadway musical, a completely satisfying experience for the viewer interested in laughing, thinking and singing along. When I first saw the film back in the late '70s, I was struck dumb by the musical within the story, until I realized what irony was, that is.  Mel Brookes at his very best, working with the very best, nurturing the very best.  The stereotypes, the caricatures, and the very real situations presented will leave a lifelong impression on you.  Everytime you hear the term ""concierge"", for instance, you will immediately start the routine, ""I'm the concierge.

From its marvellous opening credit sequence right through to the end this maintains a very high standard of comedy. Fortunately for Mel Brooks he was lucky enough to get Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the two leading roles. They both give outstanding performances which are very nearly matched by Kenneth Mars. He plays 'Franz Liebkind' the writer of a musical that both Max and Leo (Mostel and Wilder) believe will fail horribly and make them a fortune. Of course not everything goes quite to plan and the rest you should see for yourself.

The extras in this two disc edition are very good. The original statement from Peter Sellers after he first saw The Producers is read. Sellers described it as ""the ultimate film...."". Later Sellers used a large chunk of Liebkinds dialogue in a famous interview on the Parkinson show in the UK. There is a 63 minute documentary on the making of The Producers and some outtakes as well.

The screenplay is sharp-witted and absurd and showcases two of the most loveably devious con artist around.  They are Mr. Max Bialynstock (Mostel) and Mr. Leo Bloom (Wilder).  Max is a seasoned con artist who has a penchant for snagging little old ladies as investors in his doomed stage productions by trading romantic favors for monetary contributions (with the checks made out to ""Cash"").

Yet, together, the two men put their heads together and hatch the most devious scam of all--prepare a Broadway stage production doomed for failure, ask for 25,000% from the would-be investors, cash checks from the failed project and then run to the bank.

Harrison also had a morbid sense of humor which would explain why the producers appealed to him...along with a fascination with Hitler which was shared by Keith Richards and thousands of other british males  of their age who grew up playing in bomb-craters and rubble of their cities.

969565,4,6305112878,"Mel Brooks scored a coup with his directorial debut entitled The Producers. This very well done comedy remains a Mel Brooks masterpiece to this day. The plot is engaging; the actors wow you with convincing performances and the dialogue features one liners and hilarious scenarios that sizzle all the way through the picture.

Zero Mostel plays the has-been Broadway producer Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder plays the rather docile and neurotic accountant Leo Bloom, two men who decide to raise money for a Broadway flop in order to abscond with the investors' money. The movie boasts many funny scenes in which Max Bialystock woos little old ladies in order to get them to pay for this flop; and Max's ability to convince Leo Bloom to leave his accounting job and join him on this scam provides great entertainment. I love the scene at Lincoln Center when Leo finally decides to join Bialystock at the exact same moment that the fountains at Lincoln Center burst upward in all their glory! Many reviewers write that the funniest scenes take place in the earlier parts of the movie when Max Bialystock cons the elderly women out of their money. I myself found the scenes in Max and Leo's office after the play scores a hit to be even funnier than the scenes earlier on in the movie. Their horror at the play's success is reflected when Max says to himself ""Where did I go right?"" The extremes of Max and Leo's greed are reflected in their swanky new office with Lee Meredith playing an attractive Swedish secretary who can't speak English. These scenes are very funny and way over the top. I just had to laugh at the scene in the Springtime For Hitler play in which the dancers joyously goosestep at the thought that Hitler will save Germany and make them proud Germans again.

People mention that Mel Brooks took a chance with this movie. They are right. This movie employs very touchy material to be funny that instead of being humorous could easily offend many people. The film risks offending people with the Nazi $wastika shot in the play Springtime For Hitler produced by Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom; and its treatment of ga*$ and women risks controversy, too. Mel Brooks deserves much credit for insisting that the movie be produced as he wanted it; one of the very few changes Mel Brooks conceded was to change the name of the movie from Springtime For Hitler to The Producers.

The cinematography excels although there are a few minor errors: I noticed that after Max cleans his old office window with his handkerchief the handkerchief is dirty--but it is clean again in the next shot. The camera angles reflect good judgment. The choreography is excellent: the dance scenes in Springtime For Hitler reflect a lot of forethought. The fight scenes between Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom demonstrate solid choreography as well.

Other notable performances include Dick Shawn as L$D, the flower child who at the last minute scores the part of Hitler in Springtime For Hitler, and Kenneth Mars who plays the Nazi author of Springtime For Hitler. Christopher Hewitt turns in a solid performance as the rather eccentric and flamboyant director Roger De Bris. Excellent!

My only real regret is that this DVD does not offer much in the way of extras. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish and the film is presented in widescreen format but that's it in the extras department. I wanted extras on this DVD; and I was slightly disappointed by the dated stereotypes of ga*$ and young Swedish women who could only be loose. Therefore I will take off one star for this film to make this a four star review.

Overall, this movie is a Mel Brooks classic that many people will enjoy even if they are not Mel Brooks' fans. The plot is easy enough to follow and the acting and dancing are excellent. I highly recommend this film for people who want to become better acquainted with the comedic genius of Mel Brooks as well as people who love good comedy. People who like films about the seedier side of show business will delight in a treatment of this topic using solid comedy instead of the much more typical dramatic approach.

Although released before my time, I fell in love with this movie in the mid-90s when a friend sent me a tape of it - and I haven't stopped laughing since.

Mel Brooks is a comedic genius.  The folks doing parodies of just about everything today should really study his movies - they're over the top without being over the top.  It's apparent his movies are making fun of something, but the idea is original in its execution.

The late Zero Mostel was a riot as Max Bialystock and no one but Gene Wilder could have supported him in his role as the nerdy accountant Leo Bloom.  This movie should have never been touched (on either Broadway or remade like everything else today), but that's just from a purist's point of view.

969620,3,6305112878,"CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN...I have been a big fan of the original theatrical cut (circa 1968) for nearly 40 years. My biggest disappointment is that there is no video format that has ever kept that original vision intact. This classic comedy had been hacked up on network TV long before commercial video formats ever existed. By the time it was released to laserdisc, two terrific scenes were edited down or out (probably for reasons of pacing and flow). My personal feeling is THOSE SCENES WORKED BETTER left as originally conceived. The ""INTERMISSION"" sequence actually sets up the original ending for the film. Max buys the drunk at the bar his drink, makes a toast ""TO TOAST"", then ambles over to the jukebox. Max then invites Leo and the Drunk to sing-along
to ""By The Light of the Silvery Moon"". The truncated (video) version shows them already in the middle of the tune when the ""Springtime"" theater patrons rush in. Secondly, in the original version Franz stomps out ""THE QUICK FUSE!"" before the theater blows up. Perhaps Mel thought the scene played out funnier having the playhouse blow-up after their terrified screams. To me it doesn't. It is way too obvious and cliche. The original vision has Franz wiring the dynamite to the plunger box whereon the drunk from the bar completes the circuit, mistaking it for a shoe shine box. ""OKAY BOYS"", he declares. ""SHINE 'EM UP""...KABOOM!!! This was unexpected and very very funny. I was hoping this new two disc release would restore the original vision of the film. Sadly it does not. I understand there is a deleted scene in this package. But the deleted scene was not deleted from the movie...it has been deleted from the video presentation. I agree with those individuals who balk at FORCED commercials, products or trailers on DVD. This is reprehensible. It ranks right up there with FORCED commercials in multiplex theaters.

Add Mel Brooks' completely irreverent script, describing the venality of the theater biz and the seldom-discussed ""lighter side"" of the Nazi movement (the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"") and there's fun for all (well -- not all -- I'd exclude kids under 12, perhaps).

One matter that seems inexplicable is Brooks' reluctance to add any extras to the newly-released DVD versions of The Producers.  I guess he believes he's put it on the screen, and ""Tthhaat's alll, folks!!""  Of course, in recent years he's been very busy with the musical and subsequent film, as well as attending to the tragic, final illness of his late wife, the brilliant Anne Bancroft, so perhaps more will come at a later date.

I should also add that the movie ending differs from that of the current popular Broadway show, -- so beware of friends bearing spoilers.

As much as I enjoyed the Broadway production, you'll find that it's basically a prettified version of the movie with dancing and more songs, and despite the considerable talents of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, they pale somewhat beside Mostel and Wilder.  It may be hard to believe, but Mostel had a subtle side, which he could use to great success when appropriate, and Nathan lane is still finding that part of his range.  Actually, I was quite disappointed that the musical followed the movie so slavishly 95% of the time, to the musical's detriment, I think, given that so many people are (or should be) familiar with the movie.

The movie suffers in only one way: As was common in those times, Brooks edited the film to allow for audience laughter in the theater so the next comedic line wouldn't be stepped upon.  This means seemingly inexplicable pauses dot the film and tend to make it drag a bit, no pun intended (Blazing Saddles also has this quirk/problem).  If you're watching with a group of friends, this won't be noticeable.

Thus unraveled the pursuit of the greenback by Zero Mostel and Gene Wider, the new partner he coaxed into a bold venture.

What to look for are the two faces. Zero Mostel has a versatile look. He can beg (ladykiller), howl at (Gene Wilder) and be as tame as a little kitten (just to calm the hysterical Gene Wilder down) within seconds. He is cunning and sophisticated, a wolf under sheep's skin. He is no longer the Fiddler in the Roof, his another stage success. Gene Wider is the good-natured, timid and interesting guy who was nudged along by the persistent producer to join the farce. He is nave yet meticulous. He has the brains and delivers the lines softly yet powerfully.

These two characters have been copycats for a number of subsequent movies. Yet their performances are not surpassed.

He has a way with older women, and extracts financing for a string of flops, but is no longer living a lavish lifestyle.  A chance remark by his accountant, Leo Bloom (played by Gene Wilder), leads to a scheme to produce a guaranteed flop and make money by overselling shares in the profits.  They sell 25,000 percent.  The scheme seems foolproof, but fools can surprise you.

They pick a play called, Springtime for Hitler, written by a somewhat crazy playwright, Franz Liebkind (played by Kenneth Mars).  As a director they hire Roger DeBris (played by Christopher Hewitt), who has had a run of 20 flops that closed on the first night (if they made it that far).  For the lead they hire a spaced out Lorenzo St. DuBois, a.k.a., L.S.D. (played by Dick Shawn), who seems to have no acting talent.

Convinced that they have a guaranteed flop, they start a lavish lifestyle.  Max takes money to buy himself a ""toy,"" a gorgeous Swedish office assistant, Ulla (played by Lee Meredith), whose main work seems to be go-go dancing.  Things are on track until opening night.  The audience seems offended until L.S.D. takes the stage, and then laughter sets in.  There is no accounting for taste.  What do you do if you have sold 25,000 percent of a hit?

The director, De Bris, wants to praise them.  The author, Liebkind, wants to kill them.  Ulla wants to dance and serve champagne.  Max and Leo are grasping at straws.

Overall, it is extremely funny.

While a recent stage play has been based on the motion picture, a stage play can never capture the closeups of facial expressions.  No actor will ever be able to compare with Zero Mostel in his role as Max.",1139011200,4,1827,4.611801242236025
969708,5,6305112878,"Mel Brooks started to come into his own when the American zeitgeist was beginning to change. His rise to fame began with the 1000 YEAR OLD MAN Recordings he did with Carl Reiner. That opened up some possiblities and gave him the connections he needed to break into the film business. The first movie he took around to get made was a film he had originally starting writing as a story, that turned into a play, and then ultimately into a movie. The film was entitled SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER. He finally got Joseph E. Levine to agree to produce the film, but only if the title was changed (there wasn't a movie house in the country at the time that would show a movie with Hitler's name in the title).  Thus, after a little thought, THE PRODUCERS was born.

The film tells the crazy story of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom. Bialystock is a once famed Broadway producer who has seen a string of bad luck and now earns all of his income through making love to wealthy old ladies. One day, Bialystock is approached by Leo Bloom. Bloom is an accountant who is sent check Bialystock's books. Bloom discovers that Bialystock hasn't been honest in his bookkeeping but he feels bad for the man and doctors his books for him.  While doing so he makes the totally innocent observation that a person could become rich with one flop instead of a string of successes.  Bialystock then convinces Bloom to join him on his crusade to become a millionaire. They search for the worst possible script they can find, have it directed by the worst director in New York, and make sure that the leads are untalented nobody hippies.  What follows is a hilarious romp and misadventure that could only happen either on Broadway or in Hollywood.

THE PRODUCERS was perfectedly cast. Zero Mostel (Bialystock) was a famed Broadway actor, but outside of New York very few people had heard of him. He emodies Bialystock.  At the time THE PRODUCERS was made, Gene Wilder was a nobody who gained Mel Brooks' attention when he appeared in a play with Brooks' wife. That eventually led to him co-starring as Leo Bloom. Wilder had only appeared in one other movie before THE PRODUCERS and Leo Bloom became Wilder's ticket to stardom.

When it first was shown, THE PRODUCERS was seen as ground-breaking comedy and indeed, it was. Had it arrived a few years earlier, the film would have flopped. Had it arrived a few years later, it would have been seen as a rip off as something that came before. As it turns out, THE PRODUCERS turned out to be a new type of comedy that helped bring the fun back to Hollywood. Not only that, but it earned Mel Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay. It was Brooks' first movie to direct and over 30 years later, it remains his best work.",1136505600,5,2725,4.535641547861507
969709,5,6305112878,"I feel almost obligated to write this review because this has been my favorite comedy movie for many years.  Now, due to the success of the stage version and remake, it has finally received some of the acclaim it's deserved for so long.  But why mess with perfection?  This film combines innocence and debauchery, has great dialog and music, and somehow manages to make Hitler and WWII funny!  No easy task (especially way back in 1968 when memories of the war were still relatively fresh), but done perfectly.

IMHO, this is by far the best of Mel Brooks' work - some of which I actually don't find very funny at all.  Somehow it all comes together in this one.  Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder and, well, really the whole cast, are perfect for their roles.  Everyone throws themselves into their parts and it works wonderfully.

Even the title works.  Brooks was originally going to call the work ""Springtime for Hitler,"" but, correctly, thought that would put off some people.  Instead, calling it ""The Producers"" lets you have another laugh when they find the perfect script for a musical that can't possibly make money (and therefore lets them scam their unwitting investors).  Of course, it all backfires - but by the end it seems that everything has come out just right.

This is a true classic.  While it's still as funny today as it was the day it was made, they simply don't make films like this anymore (although they evidently tried to make one just like it).  Clearly this is a film for adults - not because it has ""adult situations"" (it's rated PG), but because few children could really understand it.  It is virtually free of cheap laughs or blue humor, but lacks nothing.  Even the songs, particularly ""Springtime for Hitler"" and ""Love Power,"" are good enough to stand on their own without the visuals or context that the film provides - as part of the movie they are fantastically funny.

For me, this DVD belongs in that very select category of those worth buying (not just renting), to watch over and over.",1134950400,9,2019,4.671388101983003
969710,5,6305112878,"How could anyone not love this film? ""The Producers"", made back in 1967, was Mel Brooks' first movie.  The basic plot is, by now, well-known: Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), a down-on-his-luck theatrical producer, and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), his mousy accountant, concoct a scheme to deliberately put on the worst play in Broadway history and thereby bilk the investors (a bunch of rich little old ladies) out of millions.  Their vehicle for calculated failure? A play called ""Springtime for Hitler"" written by a Franz Leipkin, a crackpot ex-Nazi, quite literally on the run from the U.S. State Department.  Their choice for director is Roger Debris, a looney-tunes transvestite who is attracted to Leipkin's play because it's a departure from musicals and a chance to do straight drama (Debris: ""I never knew that the Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean it's just drenched in historical goodies like that!"") Next is casting:  they choose as their lead a Jim Morrison wannabe by the name of Lorenzo Say Dubois (LSD).  The opening night ""Springtime for Hitler"" production number is just brilliant.  It lives up to every expectation:  it's absolutely the worst, the most vulgar, foul, tasteless, obnoxious and offensive production in the history of musical theater.  It's just the ultimate parody of a Broadway show:  what if somebody decided to do a musical about the life of Adolph Hitler? As the shocked and insulted opening-night audience is filing out of the theater, LSD, dressed as the Fuhrer, is found onstage with Eva Braun.  He says something to her. Somebody laughs.  Slowly, the audience begins to file back into the theater.  And this is where this movie reveals its genius:  Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom set out to make a deliberate flop.  The result was something that was so bad, so horrible, so mind-bogglingly awful ... that it's actually funny.  In other words, they made something that's so bad, it's good.  They set out to produce a failure ... and failed at it, inadvertently producing a success.  That's the genius of this film.  High concept just doesn't get any higher than this. Mel Brooks won the Oscar in 1968 for his screenplay for ""The Producers"" and deservedly so: every line from this movie is a quotable quote.  Why on Earth do people waste their time memorizing lines from some mediocre, unfunny, little piece-of-fluff like ""Caddyshack""?  THIS is the movie from which you want to memorize lines:  every line of this little comic gem-of-a-film belongs in the comedy section of Bartlet's Quotations:  ""Shut up!  I'm having a Rhetorical Conversation!"", ""Will the dancing Hitlers please wait in the wings?  We are only seeing singing Hitlers!"", ""You are the audience. I am the author. I outrank you!"", and, of course, the immortal line, ""Don't be stupid, be a smarty/ Come and join the Nazi Party!"".  ""The Producers"" is something special.  I really believe that people who don't think that this movie is funny think that basically because they just don't understand it.  ""The Producers"" is probably the most brilliant non-musical property to ever emerge from the culture of Broadway and the New York theater scene.  ""The Producers"" is quite simply inspired, a work of pure comic genius.",1134950400,6,3212,5.007547169811321
969711,5,6305112878,"""The Producers"" remains one of Mel Brooks' best movies. It spawned the now somewhat familiar plot line of a flop becoming a hit to the impresario's doom. But if imitation is the highest form of flattery, this movie should feel pretty good about itself. Numerous reworkings have emerged since its initial release that has made the stunningly original plotline somewhat less shocking some forty years later. But thinking of this movie in the context of its original release (1968 - the Beatles released the ""White Album"" in the same year) it must have created quite a shock for moviegoers at the time. Older viewers, with World War II still in memory, probably gasped in the same manner as the audience shots during the uplifting musical paen to the defeated fuehrer, ""Springtime for Hitler"". Truly, the movie's vulgarity remains one of its strongest points. It's so vulgar that anything goes. From Zero Mostel's unforgivable combover to Gene Wilder's hyperactive performance to the ""little old ladies"" seductively handing out checks to the gaudy and offensive Mostel, the movie never lets up and sinks lower and lower as it goes on. But as it sinks it actually triumphs.

Some of Brooks' best satire sits in this film. The brilliant ""Love Power"", sung by LSD the hippy, delivers a satirical death blow to 1960s hippy pop. Ulla the Swedish blonde bombshell provides the sex appeal while satirizing ridiculous male expectations of ""the ideal woman"" (and the typing/champagne scene attains pure brilliance). The exaggerated homosexual theater director and his sidekick introduce a very naughty topic for the 1960s mainstream that probably had typical males wriggling in their theater seats. The ridiculous writer of ""Springtime for Hitler"" and his homing pigeons who breaks into ""Deutschland &Uuml;ber Alles"", realizes he's in public, and abruptly diverts to ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy"". And having hippies depict the leaders of the Third Reich is just a stroke of brilliance (the ""hippy Goebbels"" gives the ""hippy Hitler"" a high-five and says ""Man, I just laid the daily propaganda on the people!""). Just when the movie seems to have gone too far, it goes farther (""kill the actors!""; ""blow up the theater!""). The opening scene of the musical ""Springtime for Hitler"" probably remains one of the most outrageous things ever put to film. It still maintains some of its shock even today.

""The Producers"" throws morality and decency completely to the wind and one wonders if Brooks' aim was to parody unscrupulous people that he met in ""the business"". Regardless, Brooks presents a hilarious and exaggerated morality tale on the dangers of greed. A contagion of avarice emanates from Max Bialystock (Mostel) to Leo Bloom (Wilder). Leo catches Max's condition and joins him in a plan that only the worst of human beings would attempt. Their motivation is greed and nothing more. One of the movie's best scenes shows Leo and Max in front of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Max finally convinces Leo to join him and Leo gloriously shouts out ""I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!"" The fountain comes to life that very second, gaudily punctuating Leo's transformation in a way that words never could. It's one of the most visually funny and brilliantly revealing satirical scenes ever. Scenes this good realize the full potential and uniqueness of film.

Of course everyone knows about the re-make released this year. ""The Producers"" didn't need a remake, but Brooks scored a surprising hit with it on Broadway. The new version expands the role of Ulla and introduces a love story between her and Bloom. Consequenty, it removes the satirical cardboard cutout that she represents in the original film. Hopefully the new release will awaken a desire to see the original. And maybe someday Hollywood, instead of regurgitating remake after remake, can tap into the liberating and frenetic energy that drove Mel Brooks in 1968 to create this comedy masterpiece.",1134777600,5,3972,5.0703363914373085

969714,5,6305112878,"Since the special edition has not yet been released, I can only laud the film itself.  It's not difficult.  I fell in love with this one a LONG time ago.  It's farce, show business, comedy, and musical, all rolled up in one. As Brooks himself would probably say, ""What's not to like?""  I can only hope that the new edition will fill in the gaps and ""making of"" questions I have always had.

This classic comedy teamed Mel Brooks with Gene Wilder for the first time.  As anyone over 30 who hasn't been living under a rock at the back of a cave knows, the twosome went on to make the also-classic films ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""  (If you haven't seen those two films, you need to - and sooner than later.)

The premise of the film is a simple accounting:  sell shares in a play that's a flop, and you don't have to pay back your investors.  The loophole:  you can OVERSELL the show and keep the money - if it's a flop.  The twist:  who knows what will hit and what will flop?  (Generations of producers have pondered that one for as long as there have been theaters and films.)

So, we have a down & out producer (Mostel, in the role he was born for) whose accountant (Wilder, in all his frenetic glory) lets this information slip during an audit.  Mostel, a con artist extraordinaire, persuades a reluctant Wilder to join forces (in a sequence in front of The Lincoln Center for The Performing Arts, of all places!).  The two proceed to find the WORST possible play to produce and make a killing.  Their choice:  a paen to Hitler written by an insane Hitler worshipper.  ""Springtime for Hitler"" is bought, cast, and staged.  Alas, all is not as they envision.

The megahit Broadway show was expanded from this film.  Not having seen the show, I can only say that THE FILM CAME FIRST! It remains a classic in its own right.  (The only other time it has worked this way was with Blake Edwards' masterpiece showcase for his wife Julie Andrews:  ""Victor/Victoria."")

As with ""Blazing Saddles,"" some of the jokes and treatments are decidedly politically incorrect - gays and women come in for a share of inuendos.  Take it in the spirit in which it was first offered.  If you are easily offended, you wouldn't be watching a Brooks film in the first place.

969789,4,6305112878,"Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is fed up. He is a fat, ageing, has been theatre impressario - many years and drinks past his halcyon best. And he is broke. But his nervous and neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) suggests a scam - collect a whopping amount of sponsorship money to produce a play, and, so long as the production is a complete flop, the money doesn't have to be returned to its providers.

So Bialystock goes about charming vunerable little old rich ladies into pouring money into his production, 50% of the profits guaranteed - to hundreds of them. With the kitty established, the task is to find the worst possible production. Leafing through old scripts, Bialystock thinks he has hit the jackpot with 'Springtime for Hitler, a Musical'- 'a delightful romp at Berchestechst garden with Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun', written by Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), a Nazi crackpot who insists aggressively in a drunken stupor that Hitler was a much better painter than Churchill: 'He could paint an entire appartment in one afternoon, two coats!'. They find the right director - transexual Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewitt), the only director known to have a play close after the first night of rehearsals. For Hitler himself, flamboyant and camply eccentric lounge singer Lorenzo S. Dubois (Dick Shawn). They get him to portray Hitler in quintessential 60s flower child mode.

How can such a production fail to be a disaster?  Well you can guess what happens, and, true, the play is fairly predictable once the initial plan is in motion, but no less enjoyable for it. In fact, the glorious comic potential of the idea is the funniest thing about this movie, some scenes don't quite come off as well as they might, the humour is primarily in the immediate comic impact of the characters themselves rather than the dialogue, which is patchy at times.

This movie holds an important place in cultural history as it marks a turning point in public reactions to Nazism. The cast was predominantly Jewish and, 23 years after the end of World War II, found it liberating to be able to laugh at and mock the ideology of Nazism and all it stands for. Fair enough. The ability to laugh at the memory is an important reaction to hold alongside remembrance, horror and prevention. Since then, Nazism has been common material for comedians to use - John Cleese's 'Don't mention the War' scene in the 1970s British comedy 'Fawlty Towers', for example, 'Dad's Army', ''Allo 'Allo' and 'Monty Python' all include scenes of dressing up as Nazis. After all, why shouldn't we laugh at Hitler? Societies that don't take extremist dictators seriously are less likely to elect them.",1105833600,12,2677,4.876923076923077

969862,5,6305112878,"I'll say upfront that ""The Producers"" is one of the funniest films ever made.  Mel Brooks, at the peak of his comic genius, crafted a film that is hilarious from start to finish.  What we have to bear in mind is that Brooks took some sacred cows(for their day)and exploited them for comic effect.  Who else would start their film with an unscrupulous theatrical producer seducing an octogenarian woman for money?  Who else would think that a musical about the Third Reich is ripe for comic material?  Amazingly, Brooks' creation here is an original, unlike his later parodies of film genres, and he won an Oscar for his efforts.  Brooks is aided by a stellar cast.  Zero Mostel is hilarious as Max Bialystock, the producer without any discernible scruples.  Gene Wilder is his equal as Leo Bloom, the nervous accountant who at first reluctantly, then willingly, goes along with Bialystock's scheme.  Kenneth Mars is hilarious as Franz Liebkin, the true-believer author of ""Springtime for Hitler-A Gay Romp With Adolf and Eva at Birkdesgaden"".  Christopher Hewitt does a flamboyant turn as the play's director, Roger DeBris.  The only character I didn't buy was L.S.D., the actor eventually hired to play Hitler played by Dick Shawn.  I just found that hippie character to be too cliched.  Another minor gripe is that I found the play's opening production number funnier than anything that followed it, but the film's audience feels the opposite.  A few other casting notes is that the stewbum at the bar with Mostel and Wilder is played by William Hickey who later gained fame as the godfather in ""Prizzi's Honor"".  Lee Meredith is unbelievably sexy as Ulla, the ""toy"" that Mostel purchases for himself.",1097366400,7,1703,4.947183098591549

While I love the update and added music and schtick, I have to say that I still prefer the original 1968 film upon which the show is based, the first movie Mel Brooks ever directed. By now, the story of two producers seeking to profit from a Broadway flop is familiar, but the concept is still priceless. The comedy scenes are original and nonstop, and unlike Brooks' later films, they actually seem to feed a solid, original storyline that does not take its inspiration from other films.

Zero Mostel, with his greasy comb-over and heavy-lidded, bugged-out eyes, is the ideal choice to play has-been theatrical producer Max Bialystock. Though larger than life as always, he seems downright subdued at times compared to the sideshow of characters surrounding him. Somehow the thought of Mostel as a paid lothario for wealthy old ladies stretches beyond the bounds of credibility and taste, all the more reason to guffaw at his antics in securing investment money for his big production. With his saucer-eyed innocence and apologetic demeanor, Gene Wilder is equally hilarious as nebbish accountant Leo Bloom. All the familiar mannerisms are there, but in his first major film appearance, he seems just right in expressing first his disdain for Max's unsavory business practices and then his excitement in breaking out of his shell when he realizes he's about to become a big Broadway producer.

My favorite scenes are among Brooks' most creative concoctions - the Hitler auditions; the too-close-for-comfort elevator ride with mincing assistant Carmen Giya; the euphoria Leo feels when he becomes corrupted as he skips around the Lincoln Center fountain; and of course, the elaborate opening number of the musical that Max and Leo hope will flop, ""Springtime for Hitler"". I still think the audience response immediately after the number is priceless, among Brooks' best shots, especially when the one guy who applauds is attacked. The entire supporting cast is great - the underrated Kenneth Mars as devoted Fhrer-loving Franz Liebkind, a pre-""Mr. Belvedere"" Christopher Hewitt as the overdramatic transvestite director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla (given several unrelated opportunities to go-go dance in a bikini - predating Goldie Hawn on TV's ""Laugh-In"") and even Dick Shawn in full hippie-dippy mode as the star of the show, L.S.D. Although there are certain touches that date the film including Shawn's character, there is a sense of quaintness and even sweetness about it that does make you sad it has such a brief running time (90 minutes). There is a film version of the Broadway musical in the works, but I still think this movie stands on its own and continues to get better over the years.

The story is thus:  A small time producer (Zero) wants to get rich, his accountant (Gene) decides the best way to do this is to make a huge flop and pocket the cost of the money.  After all the IRS would never look at a flop, only a sucess.

Unfortunately the two decide on getting the worste of the worste and the baddest of the bad to star, write , and perform in the play.  The result, the smash hit Spring time for Hitler in Germany.

Who else will know? Certainly not the investors, cast or crew. A flop's a flop.
However....what if the musical is a hit?
For me, this is one of Brooks' best comedies. It has a fascinating plot, great actors aligned in roles best suited to their talents, and lyrics seamlessly integrated with dialogue and the lead characters. Better yet, Brooks succeeds brilliantly in attacking Adolph Hitler and his evil regime with ridicule which (to me) is far more effective on film than is righteous indignation. In fact, Brooks's script received an Academy Award for best original screenplay in 1968.
Wilder and Mars are among the members of Brooks's ensemble company of players.  (They also appeared in the other of my two favorite Brooks comedies, Young Frankenstein.) Mostel is probably the dominant personality but he does not overwhelm his associates. They more than hold their own and I give much credit for that to Brooks. As Lorenzo S. Dubois, Dick Shawn sails over the top and then returns...back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Andreas Voutsania does a delicious turn as Carmen Giya, an ideal complement to Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewitt) who would also be my own choice if I wanted someone who, all by himself, would ensure the failure of anything he supervises. The obvious case in point is ""Springtime for Hitler: A Musical Romp with Adolph and Eva."" Bialystock and Bloom eagerly await the audience's response (shock and silence), then happily withdraw to a bar nearby to celebrate the success of their scam. What they do not realize is that....
To repeat, I think that Brooks selected the subject matter because he wanted to make his own unique indictment of one of history's most despicable human beings.

One of the best things about the Producers, is that the basic plot is brilliant, people say to me ""Mel Brooks movies are stupid, and have no storyline,"" however, the story is so creative, that even people like that can't complain, when it comes to The Producers.
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder play two con men, who raise [a] million dollars to produce a broadway play, however, they choose the worst play, worst director, and the worst actors...why, simple...they want the play to bomb on opening night, that way they get to keep all the money they raised...the catch, if the play is a hit, they will go to prison!
Another great thing about this film, is all the characters, even ones who appear for a few minutes are absolutly hillarious!  Zero Mostel, of course, steals the show, however, ever single actor in the film are out to steal it from him, and all of them almost succed!

Gene Wilder has one of the briggest breakout performances and a very Oscar worthy turn in the supporting role of Leo Bloom.  The first scene between him and Zero is enough to make you wet your pants and it's some 10 minutes into the movie alone.
The sexual feferences are trademark Brooks and of course, you can't forget his incredible talent of song writing.  Who would've thought this comedic genius had such an incredible knack for music, i.e. the Broadway phenomenon The Producer The Musical Comedy, which is the only thing funnier than the film because the songs help crack the egg and let the hilarity flow.  Give someone more than thirty years to improve on their own work and look what can happen.
The acting is superb, Kenneth Mars is hilarious as always, especially his introduction scene with his pidgeons.  L.S.D. is the damn funniest Hitler you'll ever find, though that might be hard if you want to compare this role to Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator.
All in all, if you want to watch a comedy that is guaranteed to make you laugh and you've seen Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein already, then watch the third funniest movie ever made, The Producers, Mel Brooks' comic materpiece.  This film receives my highest recommendation.",1043798400,4,1869,4.782608695652174
970023,5,6305112878,"The Producers is simply the best comedy in American History.  Mel Brooks first movie was his best.  Much of the credit goes to the great Zero Mostel,  who was one of the best comedic actors in history.  When Nathan Lane won the Tony for portraying Max Bialystock on broadway he stated:  ""I'd like to accept this award for the late great Zero Mostel who is the real Max Bialystock"".  A classy act.  And an accurate one.  Zero Mostel made Max Bialystock alive and a great character. The scene of the play ""Springtime For Hitler""  is easily one of the classic comedy scenes in film history.  This is a must see movie for everyone.  I will be honest with you.  Whenever I have had a particularly difficult day and I am down,  I always watch The Producers and it never fails to pick up my spirit.

970024,5,6305112878,"""The Producers"" was a very bold movie for first time director Mel Brooks to tackle.  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were not nationally known movie stars, and the subject matter was very controversial.  To his credit, Mel stuck to his guns and made the movie exactly the way he envisioned it.  The only concession he made was changing the original title ""Springtime For Hitler,"" because no movie studio would promote a film and theater owners wouldn't show a movie with Hitler in the title.  The first part of the movie is hysterical, especially watching Gene Wilder getting so agitated that he appears to actually be having a nervous breakdown!  The scene at Lincoln Center is one of the most effective scenes ever filmed.  Zero finally persuades Gene to go along with his crazy scheme, and Gene yells ""I'll do it!""  Just then, the water in the fountain majestically rises up.  Gene giddily dances around the fountain as Zero smiles approvingly.

The opening dance number of the play ""Springtime For Hitler"" is outrageously over the top, with the dancers wearing Nazi uniforms and goose-stepping across the stage.  Especially offensive to some is when the overhead view shows the dancers below in the form of a swastika.  As Mel said in his interview, if you've gone that far out, you might as well go all the way.  The cult status of the film has grown over the years.  Life imitated art when ""The Producers"" was turned into a real Broadway musical.  The staggering success of the play led to the film finally being released on DVD.

The comedy here is outrageous as Zero Mostel & his accountant hit on the scheme of having a whole batch of rich old ladies supplying financial backing for a planned flop, and what is more likely to flop than a musical biography of Hitler titled ""Springtime For Hitler""?
Indeed, this is an example of comedy in bad taste which is so hilarious, you can't possibly be offended by it.  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are at their very best.
This is a true comedy classic.",1041811200,2,497,4.391304347826087
970064,5,6305112878,"""The Producers"" is the essence of the cult film. You either love it or you don't get what all the hubbub is about. Those of us who love it, really love it.
By now, the plot is familiar - a crooked producer (Zero Mostel) cons a nebbishy accountant (Gene Wilder) to help him pull off a scam to net a million bucks (a lot in 1968) by producing the greatest Broadway flop ever. The opening credits sequence - a seduction between Mostel and an 85 year old Estelle Winwood (Hold Me, Touch Me) in which you have to ask who is seducing who - is riotous, and from there the comedy escalates.
Mel Brooks fans may be disappointed because this is the most un-Brooksian comedy he's made. It isn't a genre parody or a pastiche, it's a genuine farce with a plot that builds and twists and turns, with the characters going further and further out onto the limb with every twist. By the time the opening number of ""Springtime for Hitler"" unfolds, complete with dancing stormtroopers and chorus girls with pretzels and beer on their breasts, you can't believe you've suspended your disbelief quite so far, and you can't imagine what's to come.
At its heart, though, ""The Producers"" is sort of a coming of age comedy. Gene Wilder is as manic as he's ever been, but it his vulnerability that really sells the role of Leo Bloom. Zero Mostel is a force of nature, all bluster and bull, but is also the older brother who Bloom never had, who takes him under his wing and shows him the world. And Ulla is ... just Ulla, the Swedish Tease.
After years of wasting away on VHS, it's great to see this movie as a crisp new DVD transfer. (I've never seen the blacks so black before!) The extras are a mixed lot. The ""Making of"" documentary is well done, but the sketches and photos are presented in no order and with no context. Lee Meredith is a bit of an embarrassment (though still in great shape at 55!), and a little of her goes a long way.
But the movie is a comic masterpiece. The lines are still quotable today, Brooks is as unashamed of bad taste as ever, and the performances are all spectacular. Ever with no extra features, it would be worth it to have this movie remastered and preserved on DVD for a new audience. I first saw ""The Producers"" on TV as a kid, when my uncle made my cousin and me watch it with him. Hopefully this new transfer will introduce Bialystock and Bloom to a whole new legion of fans.",1041811200,3,2392,4.353467561521253
970065,5,6305112878,"I'm so happy this movie finally made it to dvd. I know it was because of the renewed interest due to the Broadway play, but it works for me.
Zero Mostel, of course, is Max Bialystock, a down on his luck Broadway producer who is reduced to seducing little old ladies and having them invest in his play. Gene Wilder is Leo Bloom, an accountant who discovers the scheme that sets the whole movie in motion - more money can be made from a flop Broadway play than a hit. Bialystock considers it briefly and decides to act upon this newfound knowledge by convincing Bloom to join in on the scam by promising retirement to Rio. They decide to find the worst play, worst actors and worst director to make this scam pay off for them. And it looks like it could work - who _could_ like a play about Adolph Hitler complete with music and huge dance mumbers with showgirls dressed as Stormtroopers?
Mostel plays a wonderful part - he was a great actor - and he is a joy to watch as he romances the old ladies. WIlder plays neurotic very well and is hilarious to watch, especially the ""I'm wet, I'm in pain and I'm still hysterical"" bit. Kenneth Mars (look for him on ""Malcolm in the Middle"" as Francis' boss at the ""dude ranch"") is terrific as the old Nazi pining for Hitler and ranting about Churchill. Lee Meridith as Ula is especially memorable - and if you want to see how well she aged, check the additional features section. This movie is funny from beginning to end.
This is one of Mel Brooks' best movies and I recommend it highly on dvd. The colors are bright and clear, the sound is great and the additional features make this a worthwhile investment for any Mel Brooks fans or somebody just wondering about Mel Brooks' movies.",1041638400,4,1725,4.410658307210031
970066,5,6305112878,"Wow, for a movie that almost never made it, it's great to see the special edition with comments from the cast and crew.

Zero Mostel is a has-been Broadway producer who spends his days wooing checks from his little old lady investors.  When an accounting firm sends auditor Gene Wilder to look over the books, he unwittingly inspires the has-been to hatch a sure-fire plan:  produce a sure-fire flop, then abscond with the proceeds of his show.  These new producers, the has-been and his new partner the accountant,  find the worst play, Springtime for Hitler, written by the worst author (Kenneth Mars).  They find the worst director and then find the worst actor to play the lead.

Next comes the wooing of the little old ladies to fund this project.  Somehow, these new producers manage to sell 25,000% of Springtime for Hitler.  What did they do right??!?!?!

Hidden treasures in the 2002 version include an editorial Peter Sellers wrote after his private viewing and the alternate ending.  Who would have thought that Peter Sellers and Dustin Hoffman were considered for the part of the ""accountant"" before Gene Wilder.  It's almost amazing to think this was a movie that almost ""never was"".

My husband's favorite part was the ""intermission"".  It took him a while to get the joke, but we were both laughing through out (you'll just have to see it to believe it).

970067,5,6305112878,"""The Producers"", which has gained newfound fame due to the Musical Comedy that Mel Brooks created based on this, his first movie, is also the best thing Brooks has ever done.  ""Blazing Saddles"" was a gag-a-minute take on the Western, and ""Young Frankenstein"" was Brooks' spoof on horror, but in ""The Producers"", Brooks' made something that was entirely his own: a madcap, hilarious, perfectly cast satire of life on the seedier side of Broadway.
The late, great Zero Mostel stars as Max Bilalystock, a former big-time Broadway producer who has been reduced to seducing old ladies for checks to fund flops.  Into his sad life comes accountant Leo Bloom(Gene Wilder in the first of several Brooks' collaborations).  Bloom is a nebbishly high-strung auditor who offhandedly mentions to Max that a producer could make more money from a flop than a hit.  This launches one of the most hilarious movies ever made, as Bloom and Bialystock scheme to find the worst sript, worst director, and worst actors to make the most tasteless and awful play ever.
The humor here is some of Brooks' finest.  He expertley skewers Broadway egos, Nazis's, and greed as he tells the tale of the production of ""Springtime for Hitler"", written by an ex-Nazi who still holds onto the idea that Hitler was a great man.  What keeps it from becoming an offensive movie is that the play is so hopelessly miscast and directed that it is just a big joke, and the fact that the audience knows that the Nazi is being taken advantage of steers the film away from the dark aspects of that ideology and makes fun of everything Hitler was trying to create.  Wilder shines as Bloom, in his first major role, as he moves from loser to producer to desperate criminal, and Mostel shows his fine gift for broad comedy in his portrayal of the morally bankrupt producer who prizes money above all else.  The film's funniest scenes involve bizzare breakdowns from Wilder, the hilarious alegiance to the defunct Third Reich by the playright, played with utter conviction by Kenneth Mars, and of course the play itself.  The opening musical number is a sight to behold, and manages to spoof every over the top broadway production ever in the sense that everyone involved in the production, save Wilder and Mostel, take it so damn seriously.
The Producers has finally gotten the DVD release it deserves, and should delight anyone who loves Mel Brooks, and perhaps win a few converts who only know him from his latter day flops(Men in Tights, I'm looking at you).  Brooks had 10 great years of moviemaking in him, and he starts it out with a bang in this film.",1041206400,66,2609,4.752212389380531

970069,5,6305112878,"""The Producers"" ranks as the best of Mel Brooks' best films due to its scathing screenplay, great comedic performances and  unmatched direction.  Gene Wilder, later immortalized in Brooks'""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" earned an Oscar nod while Zero Mostel proves why he once ruled Broadway.
Fans of the stage musical - a zany laughfest far lighter than the film - should be prepared to listen carefully for smart one-liners and generational references in a script that's chock-full of smart observations about society, and its roots in both good and evil.  While the story is essentially the same in both mediums, and while ""Springtime for Hitler"" will be familiar, the arsenal of comedic genius on display in the movie serves as a distinct point of difference, not better or worse, but far more insuinating and sardonic.  Brooks won a much-deserved Oscar for his original script, which remains to this day a lynchpin of screenwriting study.  Finally on DVD, ""The Producers"" - the original comedic gem of a movie - deserves a place of honor in your DVD collection and remains one of the best films of all time.",1040688000,5,1123,4.983957219251337

Scripted and directed by Mel Brooks (whose routine as the 2000-year-old-man remains one of the funniest creations of all times), it has an exceptional pair of lead actors in the frazzled Zero Mostel and the bewildered Gene Wilder--the eponymous producers. The very notion of creating a terrible Broadway show is hilarious; to focus on Hitler and Germany and actually make it funny is a singular accomplishment. ""Springtime for Hitler"" is, incredibly, a madly catchy title tune for the supposedly ill-fated production--splendidly performed by the feckless Dick Shawn (as Hitler). The sexual antics of Mostel and a bevy of elderly women (most notably the aged Estelle Winwood) to generate funds for the production are madly funny, yet never cruel.  Mostel and Wilder play off each other with impeccable timing, to great effect. The Producers holds up perfectly, not in the least dated, and remains as funny today as it was back in 1968.

Also, contrary to some critics, I didn't have my sides splitting as badly. However, my Dad pointed out that there are other types of humor, such as the kind that gives you a chuckle or a smile on your face. And I certainly had a big grin as I watched ""The Producers"".
Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a once great Broadway producer, who's now dirt poor (""I'm wearing a cardboard belt""), and reduced to having to call on little old ladies to get ""checkies"" for his next upcoming play, which may not be for awhile. However, his new accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) discovers a way to get rich off a flop: Get more financing then you need for the budget, find a play so bad it will run only one night and live off the leftover money. But, if they fail and the show's a hit, they will go to prison for fraud. The two immediately go to work, getting the rights to the play ""Springtime for Hitler"" from the author, an insane ex-nazi (Kenneth Mars) and hiring the worst possible director and cast. On opening night, the producers are confident of their failure. But the audience loves it, making ""Springtime"" a Broadway sensation. Now the race is on to stop Hitler before they land in prison.
There are several very funny and memorable scenes in ""The Producers"", Some of Bialystock's attempts to get money from rich old ladies, such as from one who can't hear well and another who's rather overprotective of her security, are very funny. The first appearance of the play's director (Christopher Hewitt) and his assistant (Andreas Voutsinas) is also very funny, though rather odd. I also liked the songs, such as ""Love Power"" performed by the hippie L.S.D (Dick Shawn), who is cast as Hitler, ""Prisoners of Love"" and, of course, ""Springtime for Hitler"". The music score is also very good, sounding like a Hollywood musical from the 1940's or `50's. There is also much great dialogue, my favorite being: ""A toast...to toast. I love toast."" (That reminds me of the best man's speech at my sister's wedding). Finally, how can I ignore Lee Meredith as Max's secretary who can't speak any English and, when told to go to work, most certainly does.
Some of the funniest stuff in ""The Producers"" comes through facial expressions characters make: Mostel dominates in this category: I like his expressions during the scene where he reveals his timetable to Leo and when he's waiting for the overprotective lady to unlock her door. Hewitt and Voutsinias are also both very funny and suggestive of their homosexuality without saying a word about it. Wilder's expressions during the opening scenes, when Max is meeting one of the old ladies, is also very funny. L.S.D's actions and gestures during the ""Love Power"" performance and his scenes as Hitler also tell so much about him and his mental state, without him actually saying anything about it. Hint: He's probably on the drug his initials form.
However, some of the scenes are played a bit over the top, and this was my only problem with the movie. Granted, this was probably the intention. But, the scenes could have been better played to get maximum laughs. One example is when Leo gets a panic. Wilder is so frantic and over the top that the scene was very annoying to watch, even when Leo got his blue blanket out. But the ""I'm wet and I'm still hysterical"" line did get a laugh. The first meeting with ""Springtime's"" author, as he discusses why Hitler was a better person then Churchill, is also somewhat bad because we can't understand what the guy is saying half the time. Same with the scene after opening night, when he tries to kill Max and Leo. He changed repeatedly from being insane to being normal and relaxed. In ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"", the actors played their roles, for the most part, straight and allowed the material to get the laughs. In here, they sometimes don't trust the material enough.
That said, this is a funny movie. If you've already seen it, I don't need to add anything else. But, if you haven't seen it yet, one word of advice: Even if you are a big Mel Brooks fan, don't expect too much. Though its widely considered one of the, if not the, funniest movie, it all depends upon the eye of the beholder. The more you expect, the less you will get. It's also possible, as some others have said, that this movie grows on you and gets funnier with every viewing.

In a nutshell: Shady theater producer Max Bialystock (played brilliantly by Zero Mostel) keeps himself in cravats and velvet coats by ""wooing"" little old ladies--RICH little old ladies--into investing in his nonexistent plays. The sight of the abundant Mostel playing coy sex games with very aged women is enough in itself to give the average person a coronary from laughing too hard.
But then...BUT THEN...Bialystock hires an accountant to review his books. Enter innocent, deeply disturbed Leo Bloom, played to the hilt by a young Gene Wilder, and the goings-on get almost too funny to stand. Wilder tends to have anxiety attacks (""I'm HYSTERICAL! I'm HYSTERICAL!""), which he calms by rubbing his blue blankie (kept in his suit pocket) against his cheek.
Under Max's diabolical tutelage, Leo reluctantly agrees to a nefarious moneymaking scheme. The two will sell 25,000 percent of a new play that they know will be the all-time flop. The play will be a one-nighter, and they will abscond with the investors' funds. But first they have to find a horrible play, and then they have to cast it with equally horrible actors. And they do: the play, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" is so offensive, it's a surefire loser. And the actors? Even worse. So the stage is set...Or is it?
Truly this is a classic comedy, one for the ages. Filmed in black and white and played for outrageous laughs, it has survived in all its hilarity from 1968 until now.",1025136000,5,1670,4.94661921708185

I've not liked all of Mel Brook's films; but, I believe this first one is one of his finest. Mr. Brook's fingerprint is on each of his films. It is easily recognized by any Mel Brooks fan.

It is about two Broadway producers who borrow money heavily in order to finance a Broadway show that will flop. The idea is that if they borrow more than they spend, then they get to keep the rest of the money and make a fortune. The hoped for flop is a musical based on the life of Hitler, called 'Springtime for Hitler.' It all goes hilariously wrong when the musical becomes an unintentional success.
The performances are spot-on. Zero Mostel barnstorms his way through every scene and Gene Wilder was never better as the nervous accountant-turned-producer who falls foul of Mostel's greedy ambitions. Kenneth Mars' performance as the deranged ex-Nazi burns itself into your brain and has you in hysterics whenever he is on screen. Brooks keeps the pace frantic but firm, neither letting it drag nor allowing it to go too over the top. The performances are manic but the actors never ham it up for the camera. Even the sheer bad taste of the musical sequence of 'Springtime for Hitler' is handled with skill, and you will never find a funnier scene in cinema. This film is a comic masterpiece.

The cast of odd-balls, headed by Zero Mostel at the top of his game, plays it straight (well, except for Karman Ghia!) which makes the gags even funnier. Watching Gene Wilder's character (Leo Bloom) evolve from a shy, neurotic accoutant to outrageous Broadway Producer is also great fun. The jokes come at you so fast that you have to actually pay close attention or you'll miss the best parts. This is especially true of the visuals. These are classic Brooks sight gags that usually come from Mel's naughty sense of humor - watch for the camera panning back from Max's broken hand in a plaster cast during the court room scene with crying old ladies in the background. To die for. The Producers is the entire Brooks joke book in a nutshell....Maybe this is not the best movie for really young kids because of the underlying theme - Max having sex with older, shall we say mature, women for money - but it's played with so much energy and good humor that most teenagers should be able to handle it.

Since the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"" and W.C. Fields' ""It's A Gift"", both from 1934, there are very few film comedies which even approach ""Classic"" status. My personal favorites, along with the three just mentioned, are ""So Fine"" with Jack Warden as a desperate garment industry Manager, and ""The Freshman"", with Marlon Brando, sending up his ""Godfather"" role.
What makes this picture so entertaining is the twisted plot - you really can't see how, or decide when the demented scheme (of raising too much money for a terrible Broadway play and leaving for Rio when it's time to pay the investors) will blow up in the faces of the milquetoast Accountant Gene Wilder or the has-been Producer Zero Mostel. And just when you feel spent from laughing, a huge opening night production number of ""Springtime For Hitler"", with a goose-stepping chorus line and Busby Burkeley effects, is presented.
Yes, a few segments have not traveled well through time, specifically, the scenes mocking the ""gay"" Valet or ogling the bubble-headed blonde Secretary; the very entertaining Hitler ""audition"" by the failed Beat Generation follower turned Flower Child Dick Shawn also doesn't quite register by now, but altogether this film must be considered as essential viewing.",1012780800,3,1481,5.175

Naturally, a bizarre musical comedy based on Hitler is the ultimate farce, and the scenes of the show are amongst the funniest I've ever seen in any film - especially the title number, complete with show girls who wear pasties in the shape of pretzels and Gestapo officers kick stepping.
The ""world"" of The Producers is one in which every character is a broad caricature, and the action is never anything approaching reality, and herein lies its very appeal. Political correctness would destroy the fun. The characterizations are so blatantly bizarre (giving us the opportunity to howl with laughter at the grossly exagerrated traits - whether avarice, timidity, inflated ego, or a desire for attention) that they cannot be taken as pointed at any living individual or ""group.""
Zero Mostel is the ultimate con man - a charming rogue who seems a blend of Falstaff and a peek at Wall Street through a Coney Island (distorting) mirror. The timid Gene Wilder character, a study in extreme anxiety who still cannot resist the chance to go for the gold, has wonderful moments, perhaps the best being his attempts to convince the judge that his selfish business partner has given people so much joy that the scam was for the best.

Gene is the nervous, shy, and constantly panick-stricken accountant with the little blue blanket who comes to balance Max's books.  Discovering a minor $2000 discrepancy, he asides to himself, yet loud enough for Maz to hear, that someone can make a fortune by producing a flop.  From there, the dream is born, and there is no turning back.  Max and Leo embark on a journey to discover the worst play ever written, sure to close on page four.

Once the play, and the playwrite are secured, the two need to find the worst director.

970285,5,6305112878,"Mel Brooks is a genius of comedy, there is no denying that.  In the past 33 years, he has generated some of the best American comedies that people have found to like, dislike, and laugh all the way.  The Producers was his first, and even though it has gotten the (very good) Broadway treatment, it is still the quintessential comedy containing satirical points, insanity, absurdity, nutty acting and Dick Shawn.
The film stars Zero Mostel as a producer who has fallen on hard times (he is sleeping with little old ladies to get backings for his constantly flopping plays), until an account with a lot of demure (Gene Wilder in one of his finest and funniest roles) gives him the idea to make a flop on Broadway, and actually make it a kit, if only for themselves.  This inspires the two to get a nazi's (Kenneth Mars) scrpit, a gay director, a Sweeish-tease of a secretary (Lee Meredith), and a flower power actor (Dick Shawn in one of the best comedic roles ever) to make Springtime for Hitler.
Wow.  Even if the film didn't deliver laughs (which is not true because it delivers them by the dozens) for some, Brooks' ideas are enough for a whole string of films, but he is able to compact them into one very amusing and incredible comedy that gets better with each passing year.  The numbers ""Love Power"" and ""Springtime for Hitler"" are equally memorable.",992476800,7,1356,4.609958506224066
970286,5,6305112878,"This is the original movie upon which the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical is based.  (How odd -- movie first, THEN the play?  Usually it's the other way around.  But then again, everything about this film is backwards -- including the plot.)
 The premise is very simple: two producer/con men plan to bilk some wealthy patrons of the arts by raising funds to produce the worst play of all time, ""Springtime for Hitler.""  According to their plan, the play will bomb and close after one night, the show will then declare bankruptcy, and the bogus producers will take off with all the money.  Problem is, ""Springtime for Hitler"" becomes a smash hit.  The producers, now unable to pay off their investors because all the promised percentages add up to way over 100%, end up in Sing Sing prison -- where they promptly begin planning their next play.
 Like all Mel Brooks films, this one pushes a lot of things to the limit of limits.  It was controversial when it came out in 1968, and remains so today.  Is it really appropriate to use Adolf Hitler as the subject of a comedy?  Can we legitimately laugh at the man who is responsible for the murder of millions, or has Brooks gone too far with this one?
 In my opinion, the film is satire, and should be viewed as such.  After all, there's a long tradition of making fun of Hitler,  going all the way back to Charlie Chaplin in ""The Great Dictator,"" not to mention all those Jewish Purim skits, where Hitler is cast in the role of Wicked Haman.  Then there were the German comedians of the time.  One of the first things Hitler did when he came to power was to shut down the cabaret acts that were poking fun at him on stage.  (Spoil sport!)
 In later years, Jewish actor Werner Klemperer, himself a  concentration camp survivor, parodied the Nazis when he played the overly-pompous but incredibly stupid Colonel Klink in ""Hogan's Heroes.""  Mel Brooks, too, is Jewish, and carries on a long Jewish tradition of deflating enemies by laughing at them.  So, if Brooks is to be condemned for using Hitler as the subject of a farce, he'll have to get in line behind a long line of predecessors.
 As for me, I loved the movie.  My favorite laugh is the opening scene of the play-within-the-play, where uniformed Nazis and dirndl-clad showgirls (balancing giant beer steins on their heads yet!) dance to the theme song, ""Springtime for Hitler.""  In full Broadway extravaganza style, the choreographed dancers prance across the stage, eventually forming a giant rotating swastika.  As one shocked matron of the arts blusters in the audience, ""Talk about bad taste!""  Yes, it is bad taste -- but that's the point, isn't it?  To produce a real bomb?  The scene is a great parody of Broadway stage shows, and I roared with laughter at the very absurdity of it.  So nu, relax and enjoy!",991958400,5,2823,4.63508064516129

By the time the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number (one of the greatest songs in modern cinema) was over, he was laughing harder than I'd ever seen him laugh before.  Once it was over, he immediately rewound it to watch it again, another first for him.
So what makes this such a hilarious movie?  You have Zero Mostel; although I've never seen another of his movies, they must be hilarious as well.  You have Gene Wilder; his hilarity I already know of.  You have Dick Shawn and Kenneth Mars, nearly stealing the show.

Not only is ""The Producers"" Mel Brooks's first film, and one of his best, but it is quite simply STILL one of the greatest comedies ever made.  Why?  It's not just the plot, which itself is funny-- no, it is the performances of the late great Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock (what a name!), Gene Wilder as Leo Bloom (whose name was derived from James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" whose stage version starred Zero Mostel), Kenneth Mars as ""Springtime For Hitler"" author Franz Liebkin, Christopher Hewitt (Mr. Belvedere himself!) as flamboyantly gay, and cross-dressing, Roger DeBris (another great name!), the late great Dick Shawn as ""L.S.D."", and so on...and the interaction between all of them is just hilarious!  Even all of the smaller roles get filled with with memorable characters.  (Like the ""CONCI-OIGE!"")  For the most part, they just don't make comedies like this anymore.

Some would say that ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" are superior, but they were both watered down and made more pallatable in an effort to reach a broader audience.  The racial humor of ""Blazing Saddles"" is tame compared to the go-for-the-juggler freedoms Mel Brooks took with ""The Producers"".  There's no special effects, no expensive sets, no profanity, only the best writing and pacing possible.  After 10 or so viewings, I still find new gags, mannerisms, and nuaunces that cause belly laughs.  My favorite scene is watching the series of facial expressions that Zero Mostell goes through waiting for the appartment door to be unlocked and opened by a would-be lady underwriter of his play.  You can spend an entire viewing of this movie just studying Zero's performance - total absurdity as a ""cultured"" sleez-bag.
Being a completely over the top farce, ""The Producers"" has a very special ""feel"" to it that earned it a large cult following in the early 70's on college campuses.

970378,5,6305112878,"When I first watched this movie a couple years ago, I HATED IT!  But then a couple of friends and me at my school wanted to do a spoof on Black History Month, so we started German History Month- which is during the month of March- and I told my friends about ""SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER"" and they started cracking up!  So I went with my sister down to the library, and we checked it out and watched it again, and we were rolling on the floor laughing!  I even downloaded ""Springtime For Hitler"" from Napster!  This movie is so funny!  The characters are a riot! It's like the biggest inside joke now for us, and it's just hilarious! This is Mel Brooks' BEST MOVIE!  If anyone is the mood for a laugh, get this movie- it's a crack up, and it might not seem funny at first, but trust me- it grows on you!",977356800,,797,4.142857142857143
970379,3,6305112878,"Brooks' feature film debut is often regarded as his best film to date!  While I don't share that same strong feeling towards the film, I must  admit, it is funny. It was with this film Brooks first set up the standard  of absurdity that would later come in films like ""Blazing  Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", and ""History Of The  World pt. 1"". Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder ( Who got an Oscar nomination  for Best Supporting Actor) are perfect on screen together creating an  unforgettable, and truly hilarious comedy team. But beware, it's not just  Mostel and Wilder who will leave you helpless, no, Brooks has created more  un forgettable character. Lets take for instance, the worst director that  ever lived, Roger Debris(played perfectly by Christopher Hewett), who seems  to be a cross-dresser. I could be wrong, but when a man wears dresses, I  assume that's what he is lol. Then there's the author of the now world  famed play "" Springtime For Hitler"" Mr. Franz Liebkind. And wait  there's more, there's L.S.D (Dick Shawn) and Andreas Voutsinas, who is Mr.  Debris ""PRIVATE"" secretary. I wounder what that exactly means?  lol. Brooks hits all the right spots to get to our funny bone, and once he  gets there, he never lets up! It's just gag after gag. A wonderful,  inventive screenplay, that definitely deserved to win an Oscar, though many  at the time and even now disagree. But since I'm a Brooks fan, I think it  was the right choice. Unforgettable songs include ""Love Power"",  ""Sringtime For Hitler"", and ""Prisoners Of Love"". A  definite comedy classic by one of the funniest man around in the comedy  business today.",969148800,16,1632,4.812274368231047
970380,5,6305112878,"I was first introduced to this film by my father, who said it was the best film Mel Brooks ever made. The first time I watched it, I laughed, but  didn't think it moved the world.
Then I watched it again. As with any  great movie, it only gets funnier as you watch it more. Subtle nuances from  Gene Wilder blend so well with the over the top performances by Zero Mostel  and Kenneth Mars. And of course, the costumes are fabulous. :)

970476,5,6305112878,"How can a Broadway producer who has seen his day really make a lot of money?  Leave it to writer/director Mel Brooks to answer that, and answer  it he does in the uproarious comedy ""The Producers.""  Zero Mostel stars as  the producer in question, one Max Bialystock, with Gene Wilder co-starring  as Leo Bloom, the meek accountant who steers Max onto the path to instant  riches with a scheme that (in Max's hands) simply can't fail.  With Leo on  board as his new partner, Max embarks upon a search for the perfect script,  the first step of the plan that will lead them to the pot of gold at the  end of the Great White Way.  And with Brooks at the helm, it's the  beginning of a laugh-filled movie that gets funnier every time you see it.  Mostel is perfect as the unflappable Max, the charlatan who woos a string  of old ladies into becoming investors in his show; his personality and  countenance match the broad approach Brooks takes with his comedy, and it's  a fit made in comedic heaven.  Wilder, however, nearly steals the show with  his terrific, definitive ""long"" takes and sideward glances that have served  him so well during his career.  Here, in one of his first screen  appearances, he works it perfectly, creating just the right counter-balance  to Mostel's boldness, and it makes Leo a truly memorable character.  Visually, there is enough in this film to generate plenty of laughs, but  that it's delivered with wonderfully witty and clever dialogue as well (the  screenplay earned Brooks an Oscar), makes it a true classic in anybody's  book.  Also unforgettable here are Kenneth Mars, as Franz Liebkind,  author of the play that Max and Leo undertake to produce; Christopher  Hewett, as Roger De Bris; and especially Dick Shawn, as Lorenzo Saint  DuBois (""L.S.D."" to his friends), who becomes the star of Max and Leo's  production.  Rounding out the great supporting cast are Estelle Winwood  (""Hold me, touch me"" old lady), Lee Meredith (Ulla), Renee Taylor (Eva  Braun), Andreas Voutsinas (Carmen Giya), and William Hickey (Good Natured  Inebriate).  ""The Producers"" is every bit as funny now as when it  debuted in 1968, maybe even funnier; it proves that good comedy is  timeless, and this is comedy at it's best.  This is a must-see, not only  for Mel Brooks' fans, but for anyone who just likes lots of good laughs.  Believe me, this is one funny movie you're going to want to see again and  again.",966211200,16,2426,4.733173076923077
970477,5,6305112878,"Because you may laugh yourself to death!  This is the best comedy that I've ever seen.  Sad thing is, it's too un-PC to be made today, so be happy  that it was done in a culturally freer time.  The plot is simple:  if a  lousey Broadway play can almost make money by closing so quickly that  expenses barely exceed initial investment, why not produce the worst play  ever, with all the backing that schmooze can extract from gullibility, and  hope for the worst (best)?  The chosen play, ""Springtime For  Hitler,"" done as a musical, starring a hippie flower child, is an  absolute scream.  I won't give away more of the plot, but if you can see  only one spoof about Nazi-inspired musicals acted and directed by by  countercultural/alternate lifestyle types, for the benefit of  failures-turned-conmen, this is the one.",965865600,,819,4.784172661870503

This  movie features one of the most perfectly realized ""bombs"" ever  staged for a movie, including the truly inspired Springtime for Hitler  musical numbers.  Gene Wilder emerges in this movie as the slightly insane,  completely engaging and expert comic actor he would remain to this day;  Zero Mostel, best known prior to this for his Tevye, instead delivers on  his creepier qualities.  The performances are faultless, and the movie is a  classic, Mel Brooks' best.",962582400,2,685,4.9734513274336285

970485,5,6305112878,"For all the times I've seen The Producers, I never tire of it. And I'm continually haunted by one question: who is funnier? Dick Shawn? Or Kenneth Mars?
Shawn, as LSD, the star in the Bialystock/Bloom production of  ""Springtime for Hitler"" is outrageous,  broader even than his wonderful  turn in `It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. Mars, who many will remember as  W.D. `Bud' Prize on ""Fernwood Tonight"", is spectacular as Nazi pigeon  ranger cum playwright, Franz Liebkind.
The Producers never misses an  opportunity to stack gag upon gag--physical, musical, intellectual-no holds  barred. At 88 minutes the film falls flat at about 65, but at that point  you're so full of good humor it really doesn't matter anyway.
Kudos to  Andreas Voutsinas, and Christopher Hewett, both hilarious in smaller  roles.
