8713612,5,B003DKYDFW,"I have Taking chances world tour DVD/CD and a BD version of Through The Eyes Of The World.
But this DVD is still a must-have for celine-fans. Because the live is recorded in Montreal while the DVD/CD version is in Boston. More french songs.
It's different from other dvds that have an ugly box. What presents to you is a beautiful book with 5 postcards and 52pages of pictures inside.

I bought from beaches_entertainment. good deal!",1292025600,,433,4.697368421052632
