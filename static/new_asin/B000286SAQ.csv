2066592,1,B000286SAQ,Don't even start the movie.  Definitely not worth one minute of watch time.  Will not keep your interest unless you like bad movies.,1367625600,,132,4.695652173913044
2066593,2,B000286SAQ,"I guess when it was made it was good...maybe.  I couldn't bear to watch any more than 10 minutes of it though.  Maybe if this had any type of nostalgic influence on me I'd rate it higher, but it doesn't since I had never seen it when I was young.",1365033600,,246,3.9
2066594,2,B000286SAQ,I actually got thru the whole thing. Cheesey and a suitable subject for Mystery Theater 2000/3000.  What if you dare.,1364515200,,117,4.85
2066595,3,B000286SAQ,"WOW! What can I say about this little gem of a B-Movie?  It is a fast pace movie. A little too fast at times.
And the music is terrible. I give it a one star {And that is being kind}. Now I did like the evil monster &
witch.  They were cool looking.  The fight scenes were plain STUPID!  Those bad guys couldn't fight a flea
much less Starman.  But all in all this is a fun little B-Movie to watch and laugh at.  If you a big fan of
B-Movies as I am, you need to get this one.",1292112000,,476,3.71
2066596,2,B000286SAQ,"The film joyfully reuses the same shots of fight scenes from early in the picture later, as if one is not supposed to recall them. Regardless, I still wonder about some of the characters who appear within the film, then disappear after they have served what ever purpose they were created to serve. There are several evil doctors, a lab assistant that steals the brain in the film's opening shots, a few local detectives from the Tokyo Police Department, but, most of all, an exceptionally nerdy pair of siblings- a four-eyed nerd girl about ten years of age, and her eight year or so old snotty little brother-forerunner to the baseball cap wearing little punks of the Godzilla series. After the boy, naturally, penetrates the impenetrable defenses of the bumbling Zimarians, and is finally seen, we see him run away, get a cut, because the denouement has obviously been left on the cutting room floor, and then never see his, nor his nerdy sister's, sorry little asses again.

Still, watching Starman battle the same idiotic henchmen- who never swarm en masse, but wait to go one on one with the clearly stronger superhero, is a hoot; no matter how many times the exact same shots are recycled. But, are you telling me that, fifty years ago, they couldn't have forced Utsui to wear an undershirt beneath his costume. After all, areolae are not that....well, you get the point. I guess that's all one could expect for a film that clocks in at less than twenty cents to see. Still, the lone disappointment with the film had to be the fact that Starman never got a chance to make 'nice' with any of the handful of attractive young Japanese babes on hand. It's simply not fair to leave such allure in the air, and then not consummate it. I'd have to give this film a slight recommendation, if only for its silly camp value, and inoffensive mind-numbing. That's still better than the majority of superhero films today. Areola power!",1248825600,2,1929,4.707100591715976
2066597,3,B000286SAQ,"Starman (Ken Utsui) flies in from the Emerald planet, just in time to battle the evil, disembodied brain of Balazar! Look out! Hordes of mutants and mad scientists are out to assist Balazar in his bid for world conquest! Will Starman be able to defeat these hideous creatures? Watch as he jumps, leaps, flies, and does some sort of kung-fu dance routine, all in the name of a free and peaceful earth!...",1152662400,2,403,4.611111111111111
2066598,3,B000286SAQ,"Starman really should have bought himself a home on Earth.  That would have saved him all the trouble of flying all the way back to the Emerald Planet just to turn around and come save the Earth from hostile aliens time and again.  Of course, that would have denied us the privilege of seeing the utterly ridiculous High Council of Emerald Planet at the start of every Starman movie (which actually consist of footage from episodes of the Japanese Super Giant television serial).  They're always worried that aliens using nuclear weapons will not only destroy the Earth but the rest of the universe as well - which makes it especially peculiar that none of the alien attackers ever seem to use nuclear weapons at all.  This time the threat comes from a brain in a pan - yes, it's Balazar, the most intelligent person in the universe, who figured out a way to keep his brain alive after he was assassinated.  Balazar's Brain is basically indestructible, we are told, and he already has hordes of Zimerian spies infiltrating science institutes and governments all over the Earth.

Naturally, Balazar's Brain lives in a briefcase, one which has been stolen by a lab assistant in an attempt to kill the brain and save the Earth - ah, but that would just be too easy.  No, we have to have a big production with secret bases all over the place full of bad guys wearing rejected Batman suits, hybrid monsters able to materialize out of nowhere and kill people with the power of their supremely ridiculous costumes, and plenty of chances for Starman to dance with (uh, I mean fight) the bad guys.  If you've never seen Starman fight, you have no idea just how bad fight choreography can be.  All Starman does is wave his arms and dance around, never doing anything more than pushing his enemies away from him.  That's why his fights take forever - he pushes guys down, and they just keep getting back up.  At least it gives him plenty of exercise - and, judging by the paunch he carries around with him, he needs all he can get.

Let's talk about these hybrid monsters.  The first mutant looks sort of like the Swamp Thing if he had vampire teeth and some kind of mutant sombrero on his head.  At least he does look a little dangerous, which is more than can be said of the witch woman with a makeup job that would frighten even Tammy Faye Bakker.  Then there's Balazar's Brain, which is less than impressive once we finally get to see the darned thing at the end.

These Starman movies are just about the campiest things you'll ever come across.  They stink to high heaven, yet you just can't help enjoying yourself while you watch them.",1136678400,4,2630,4.549893842887474

2066610,5,B000286SAQ,Cool old movie I watched a long time ago and was pleased to find it again.,1468540800,,74,3.6875
2066611,3,B000286SAQ,"absolutely ludicrous aliens,  incredibly cheesy special effects, fight scenes out of a 5 year old's imagination, Precociously  annoying Japanese children being taken seriously and saving the day, and of course.... Starman, Japan's answer to Superman, complete with an incredibly uncomfortable looking, too tight costume and fighting moves that so poorly choreographed that it looks more like dancing than fighting.

The first time I saw this years ago, I laughed so hard I cried. It is one of those movies that is so bad, it actually is funny.
Best seen late at night when you are already groggy and preferably inebriated. This is one of several Starman movies made. the others are not much different.",1464912000,,701,5.131578947368421

2066613,1,B000286SAQ,This is not a 'B' movie. I would rate it as a 'Z'. ( Z= Zero ) A 12 yr old could make a better movie.,1463443200,,101,2.923076923076923

2066616,1,B000286SAQ,"Very bad early Japanese trash. If it were Ana-mi today it would probably be the most watched movie ever. Once again great if you like bad acting, bad costumes
 and bad script.",1462406400,,175,4.46875
2066617,1,B000286SAQ,"I do not know which was worse, the plot, the dialougue, or the acting.  Just watch the first five minutes, if you want a good laugh.  The space aliens were absolutely hilarious!",1453593600,,177,4.5
2066618,3,B000286SAQ,"Classic example of early Japanese SciFi. Fun, just don't take too seriously. It's not Star Wars",1445644800,,95,5.0

2066632,2,B000286SAQ,It's a combination of the old Buck Rogers and live Hentai and practice for Godzilla movies.  If you're hard core sci-fi you'll need to see this once but don't expect much.,1439251200,,171,4.516129032258065
2066633,3,B000286SAQ,Campy and fun. You have to like this kind of movie to enjoy it.,1439164800,,63,3.5714285714285716
2066634,5,B000286SAQ,"Watch with the sound off, do some art put on some oddball symphonics (Allan Pettersen comes to mind) and you have pure beautiful inspiring pulp surrealism...along with ""The Manster"" and ""Woman Eater""...wallow in it and see dreams filmed.",1438214400,2,237,5.2631578947368425
2066635,2,B000286SAQ,"Early, campy Japanese sci-fi aimed at a pre-teen/tween audience. It is what it is and it's cheesier than the first season of Power Rangers without the saving, cheesy charm of Rotten Rita.",1432944000,,187,4.875
2066636,3,B000286SAQ,"Once again, the busybody inhabitants of the Emerald Planet decide to intervene on our behalf, whether we want it or not.  They slap the fancy wristwatch onto Starman and he flies to Earth in hot pursuit of the bad brain Balazar currently being carried around in a suitcase that ends up in a river.  There are villains aplenty starting with a wheelchair bound doctor who doesn't really need a wheelchair.  Mutants are everywhere doing mutant stuff.  Children are put into jeopardy.  Germ warfare is planned by the bad brain's evil scientist who talks to his ""germ"" in a scolding fashion, reminding it that he made it, so there!

This movie is beyond bizarre.  It's outlandish, old-fashioned silliness on a grand scale.  The fight sequences alone are hilarious.  They don't fight as such; rather, Starman flings them around, often times without making body contact.  The bad guys jump or fall the moment Starman's arm comes anywhere near them.  At times it looks as though they are dancing.  A lot of these same sequences are repeated elsewhere in the movie adding to the monotony of endless repetitious action of a singular kind.  And these scenes are longggggggggggggggggg.  Long-long-long!

It was okay to watch once, but it's nothing I'd ever care to watch again.",1431043200,2,1265,4.928909952606635

In this,  stress-a-day  World "" it "",  this movie, to me anyway,  made,  a breif hiatus. One size,  does not fit all these days,  I was not born with a computer in my crib, and consequently,  enjoy things differently.

2066655,3,B000286SAQ,"... television from Japan in the 1950's and while I did enjoy it, it all seems so silly as an adult. I see no value in this as kids today would be bored but for older folks who simply want to go back to a time when they were young or to see entertainment was done at the movies in serial formats, it's a different take versus what we look for, e.g. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, etc.",1395619200,,380,3.948051948051948
2066656,1,B000286SAQ,One of the bad Japanese flicks.  Very poorly done and hard to follow.  Terribe special effects.  What was I thinking?,1391299200,,117,4.75

2066658,5,B000286SAQ,"Okay to be honest I skipped through a lot of this movie, so why would I give it 5 stars? FOR STARMAN!!!
