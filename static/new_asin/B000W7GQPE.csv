8221459,4,B000W7GQPE,"Excellent video; moderately difficult balance exercises.  Welcomed addition to your yoga, Pilates, stretching, aerobic, ballet, dance, weight training class. I find these exercises invigorating.

Cons: background music makes mental focus and concetration more difficult.",1325721600,,270,6.911764705882353
8221460,4,B000W7GQPE,"This is a good basic program for improving your balance. The moves are simple yet challenging. It requires absolutely no equipment other than room to stretch out. It does require a good deal of flexibility, which can be achieved with practice. The only downside is that Paul Zaichik has very little personality, and comes across as quite dry and dull. But the moves can be very easily incorporated into any fitness program. I do recommend it, and will probably order more of his DVD's in the future.",1236643200,4,499,4.747126436781609
8221461,1,B000W7GQPE,These series of tapes are not for someone who is trying to become flexible. You need to be at that point already. Unless you have taken instructions from a pro in this field you can get yourself hurt. There are no instructions on how to lead up to these exercises they just do them. I know I wasted my money.,1224201600,4,308,4.15
