1049155,4,6305564450,"""Boy meets boy"" is one of the timeless plotlines -- since the ancient Greeks at least -- and this well-acted romantic comedy adds a number of twists and turns to what could have been standard fare. The  showbiz wannabes of the title who lust after, long for, love, lose, and  land one another are appealling, and the men are all goodlooking -- even  the presumably plain Robert, who in the real world would have no trouble  attracting another man, even if he did wear a stupid porkpie hat as here.  Perhaps that's why the director put the hat on him, to try to disguise how  cute he is. The lead hunk, Mark, has a frequent bemused smile that suggests  thoughtfulness. He is appalled to learn that casting agents think he  ""reads light,"" and it's one of the movie's accomplishments that  Michael Shawn Lucas as Mark carries off the combination of masculine  appearance, conversation almost devoid of camp, and an unaggressive  sensitivity that makes you like him -- he's the hunk with a heart of gold,  even though he is also clearly a gym bunny for whom climbing a tree is an  exotic experience. His elusive ""must have item,"" David, is dark  and pretty as a movie mystery man should be. As the Long Island princess,  Mara Hobel is good, but her character's main shtick (trying to land a job  interview with Tina Brown despite having zero qualifications) is dragged  out too long. The resolution of one of the movie's main romantic dilemmas  in the last reel feels very artificial and is the only wrong step in this  otherwise charming and witty  tale.",944179200,15,1551,4.632352941176471

1049355,4,6305564450,"Broadway Damage's title is from a line in the dialog where Hugh Panaro playing
David, says to Mark that Broadway Damage can be spotted in Mark.  My interpretation
is that David thinks that Mark is cought up with the fever of ""making it"" and
perhaps isn't taking this more in stride. This aside, I loved the film enough that
any criticism seems trivial. Now for the trivial:  when I first viewed that film,
I wondered why actor Anson Williams' hair was so long in camparison with the others
which made me wonder for an instant if this was the 1970's.  Long hair makes hats
and caps look funny, or maybe this was intentional.  Still the character has a great
deal of charm.  Does anyone know if Williams has done other things since?  Hugh Panaro
was at the time of this film doing stage work, and I couldn't help noticing in the
credits that his rock songs were dubbed by someone else. Theory:  Panaro was in some
musical productions leading me to speculate that perhaps his is a more legitimate voice
and they need someone rougher around the edges to dub these so-so songs. There is some
Beautiful musical scoring under the scenes that take place at the wealthy estate of Mara

What an absolutely fun movie.  I knew next to nothing about the film when I put in my movie queue.  After seeing it, it is sort of hard to believe it is over 10 years old.  Some films stand the test of time or are simply timeless from the start.  That is the case with BD.

The characters/actors are adorable in both looks and personalities. The story is important enough to not be meaningless, and still light enough to be both fun and funny.  The basic  plot has been done a million times, but there is enough unique in this film to be riveting.  That Marc and Robert finally do get together in the end actually is somewhat of a surprise, though the entire movie seems to be moving in that direction.

I hope that everyone who watches this film takes with them the idea of the ""grand romantic gesture"".  It is such an incredibly awesome idea!

I have seen a number of films lately that work to be artsy and deep.  This film has the sense to be what it is and doesn't apologize.  It's kind of a modern musical, and overwhelmingly successful with the music as it's chosen and placed within the film.  I found myself looking for the soundtrack, which I'm sure would be worthwhile too.

How many modern films can say they are inspired by and adapted from musicals?  It works here, and the dialogue, too, is interesting, witty, and just plain fun.

The pacing is good, the characters are interesting and well-developed, the relationship and friendship (and rodent and insect) problems are nearly universal, and it's all tied up with a bow in the end, accompanied by an appropriate anthem.  Good fun.  It's worth your time.",1165104000,,981,4.723529411764706

1049411,5,6305564450,"C'mon, World, wake up and REdiscover this little gay gem of a movie.  There are so many out there that easily deserve their 0- or 1-Star; surely this little pearl deserves more.  Yes, 1997's ""Broadway Damage"" is probably one of the most underrated and least known ""gems"" of gay filmdom........why not discover its delights yourself?

So, just what is it about this production?  Well, hey, there's no weird, dreary storyline; it's lite and fun......with guys who are not afraid to kiss.  Yes, Michael Shawn Lucas (as Marc) has a body ""to die for"" and, c'mon, when he's also as earnestly sincere and sweet as he is, who wouldn't wanna wind up with him.  And it would be very hard to forget Aaron Williams (as Robert), playing an endearing ""little puppy"" of a guy, who'll bring down Marc in the end.  In fact, both male leads wear their sincerity on their sleeves----kinda refreshing to think there might still be guys like this out there.

Above all, if you can't stand the sunny sincerity of a Broadway musical (but without all the singing), then stay away from this cuz it definitely tries to be sincere.......and succeeds at that in spades.  Along with this there's really great cinematography:  brite and colorful (how'd they do it with what must have been a piddl'in budget?).  Hey, and there's that soundtrack to fall in love with, too.  How Director Victor Mignatti put all this together, with no more money than he likely had, is anybody's guess and is a minor (scratch that), major miracle.  How does a guy like this then just disappear from directing for the next 8, 9 years?????  Sad, sad, sad.

In closing, one thing to possibly question is if maybe, just maybe, Director Mignatti should'a rethought the title.  ""BD"" might resonate more with NY City-ers, but his own within-the-movie phrase:  ""The Grand Gesture"" might have had more meaning to audiences at large (would the latter, as a title, have drawn in more viewers/buyers who'd fondly remember this film?).  Ah, well, Monday morning ""after-thought-ing"" is always easier, isn't it?  Besides, any way you look at it, Marc and Robert are gonna wind up being one of the favorite couples you'll meet in your home film library from time to time.....I betcha!

PS:  You know what?  I'll even bet this film is one that other favorite film couples, such as Aaron & Christian* and Cedric & Laurent,** would wanna  have in their home video collections.

1049412,5,6305564450,"""Broadway Damage"" is the most adorably classic, campy, sassy romantic comedy I've seen in years!

Lead role, Robert (Aaron Williams), is absolutely cute as a button and his witty Broadway-style songwriting will make you blush and smile and get up and sing! Fellow lead, Michael Shawn Lucas, plays the role of Marc, an aspiring (not so successfully) Broadway star. The two are precious in a 'perfect ten' sort of way, and are accompanied by their quirky ""fag hag,"" hilarious, gay-ball-busting best friend Cynthia. I have to admit I'm a softie for this actress, Mara Hobel, who was also a star in ""Mommie Dearest"" (""No more wire hangers!""). Brilliant. Just campy brilliance.

The production is brilliant, the characters and acting impeccable, and most of all, the climate is over-the-top, Broadway-inspired, campy bliss with the rooting of a classic romantic comedy. Ingenious, this one, and I guarentee it will leave you smiling and wanting more, especially if you're at all exhausted with the consistent formula of gay cinema.

It is an optimistic, joyful, old-fashioned, adorable, charming film - and some folks just don't like those good qualities in a film.  But if you are looking for a film to cheer you up, or make you feel good about life, this is the film for you.

""Broadway Damage"" follows the lives of three characters who just finished college and are ready to set the world on fire... if only they can get a decent job.  One main character falls in love with a hot singer, only to find that he is not what he seems, but he later realizes that the man of his dreams was right under his nose all along.  It's a storyline you may have seen before, but you have never seen it portrayed this brilliantly.

""Broadway Damage"" is amazing in many respects: the talents of the actors are amazing; the editting of the film is immaculate - and could not have been better; the original music used in the film is the best I have heard in decades -especially Cindy Soltoff's ""Men/Someone"" piece, which is one of THE best songs to ever appear in a film or musical; and the dialogue is some of the best, wittiest dialogue you have ever heard out of the mouths of actors this young (early 20's). The film shows their naivete, but more importantly, it shows their hearts, and they are lovely hearts to spend some time with.

To call this film technically excellent is a great understatement.  It is SUPERB in its technical qualities. For a low budget film it is no less than a miracle.  You feel exactly as if you are there with the characters, strolling around Greenwich Village.  And some scenes are so memorable... well, you just have to see them for yourselves.

1049498,4,6305564450,"As a straight female teenager, I don't tend to watch very many independent films about gay males. However, there has always been something about the genre of the gay romantic comedy that has interested me, and I found this movie to be utterly satisfying.
Reading the reviews on this site, I see quite a few people who are complaining endlessly about the movie. Supposedly, the plot isn't good enough, the characters were hard to take seriously, the dialogue was cheesy...and so on. Here's my theory: when I think of almost any romantic comedy I've seen, I can come to a general definition. A romantic comedy is one in which two or more people (some movies feature inherently normal and relatable people; others are more unbelievable)get into a series of humorous mishaps in order to win someone's affection. That is exactly what this movie is, and I didn't expect any more of it. It was pleasant and fun.
After watching the movie, I realized that in retrospect, the thing that struck me about it was that it was so incredibly clean. Besides the fact that it wasn't a depressing movie about gay people (no one died or was seriously hurt in any way), there was almost nothing offensive about anything in the plot. There was: one sex scene, one additional implied sex scene, a few instances of minimal and very discreet nudity, one fight scene so small it doesn't even count as violence, maybe four instances of bad words, no drugs or alcohol, and of course, nothing scary. A lot of movies (gay and straight) are depressing. Someone dies, or ends up crying his/her heart out, or something like that. Any rejection that is suffered by these characters is quickly recovered from (even other romantic comedies tend to make you sad when the characters get hurt really badly).
Of course, my absolute favorite scene was The Grand Gesture. From that point on, I would continually find myself smiling, even when I didn't think I especially wanted to. The end melted my heart, and I went away from the movie feeling incredibly happy. I try not to put down movies that make me feel really happy like that.
So who would like this movie? Gay people, for one. Non-homophobics who also happen to be romantics. People who live in New York or harbor a special love for the city. And people who like Gilmore Girls. I noticed that this movie has a ton of the fast-paced banter and joking that Lorelai and Rory do so often on the show. Mostly this dialogue is between Marc and Robert, who sometimes adopt accents or finish one another's sentences in order to be amusing. I found it to be very funny.
One last subject before I stop this review: this movie is set in New York, and for me, it kind of had moments where it captured the spirit of NYC. I have only been in the city once, last summer, and there were a lot of memories that this movie brought back. For instance, Marc and Robert would walk down a New York street, and I would remember a similar place I walked down. And when Marc would stand on his fire escape and listen to the noises of the people on the street and the music from the houses, it brought back memories of my room in my uncle's house in Long Island, where I stayed while I was there. It felt very comfortable and I loved it.
I know, I'm a sappy romantic and a relentless New York lover. But I can't help it. I hope that anyone who reads this review will ignore the naysayers and be convinced to give this movie a try. At the very least, it should make you smile. Just a little.",1047340800,7,3481,4.4834645669291335
1049499,3,6305564450,"BROADWAY DAMAGE

(USA - 1997)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

Responding to the cynicism which had begun to blight the movie business in which he was working in a technical capacity, writer-director-editor Victor Mignatti took several years to develop a script before making his defiant feature debut with BROADWAY DAMAGE, a bright and breezy romantic comedy with a shamelessly romantic heart. Michael Shawn Lucas and Aaron Williams play lifelong friends and fellow actors, chasing their dreams through the byways of Manhattan, securing one night stands in lieu of committed relationships, and sometimes getting involved with completely unsuitable guys (a liaison with hunky neighbor Hugh Panaro is particularly disastrous). Roommate Mara Hobel (the young Christina Crawford in MOMMIE DEAREST, 1981) knows instinctively that Lucas and Williams are destined to be together, but Lucas is completely oblivious to Williams' torch-sized infatuation. With all the familiar elements thus in place, anyone who doubts the possibility of a happy ending ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves!

At a time when most low budget gay movies have more in common with radio plays than anything else, substituting dialogue for visual stimulation, Mignatti explores his characters' obsessions whilst moving the plot forward with hardly a backward glance. Much of the film's success is due to the three appealing leads: Hobel plays a spoiled rich kid, stifled by her parents' expectations, who breezes through life in a fantasy world of her own making until Big Bad Reality begins to intrude on her complacency. Williams is actually too attractive to be entirely convincing as a geeky Sondheim fanatic, but his enthusiasm is genuinely infectious, and he plays the part like a stage character, with speech intonations straight out of a Broadway production. Meanwhile, Lucas provides the film's emotional core, and he conveys just enough charm and savvy to earn the viewers' affections. Nice pecs, too.

For all its pleasantries, however, this isn't an entirely rose-tinted view of the world. Mignatti's script endorses the fundamental value of our hopes and aspirations, whilst reminding us that such things are no defence against the harsh realities of modern living. An obvious lesson, perhaps, but worth repeating, especially in the company of such big-hearted, hopelessly idealistic characters. And if it all seems a little too bland and predictable at times, the movie scores points for daring to wear a great big optimistic heart on its sleeve. Mignatti's editing skills and Michael Mayers' polished cinematography gives the production a genuine technical gloss, and there's a handful of excellent original songs (by Cindy Soltoff, Gabriel Zenone and Ken Dahl).",1006992000,14,2782,5.475524475524476

My How wacky and unique this is!  Seriously I didn't hate the movie but was a bit dissappointed, it hit all it's marks but never really developed any depth.

1049501,4,6305564450,"This makes a great gay date movie, although it is flawed by an ending that doesn't quite work in the context of the story that is being told. The problem is, it is the ending the audience will want the story to have, but everything in terms of script and performances lead to a completely different conclusion. It's too bad. With a little tweaking and maybe five more minutes, writer/director Victor Mignatti could have made his ending work.
This is definitely a New York City love story (much in the same vain of the slightly-better ""Trick""). Marc (Michael Lucas) is an actor waiting for his big break. His best friend is Robert (Aaron Williams), an aspiring Broadway composer. Robert has a crush on Marc, Marc has a crush on David (Hugh Panaro)--a musician with a secret. As Marc is drawn deeper into a relationship with David, Robert tries to find someone who will love him. Meanwhile, Marc's roommate and friend to both Marc and Robert, Cynthia (Mara Hobel in a delightful performance), deals with having to learn to live on her own. Her instability and eventual breakdown causes the three friends to re-examine who they are and what they want and need out of life.
It's hard to fault the performances or the heart of the script. There are marvelous touches and wit throughout and for 98% of the movie, the characters all ring true. It's in the final minutes of the final act where the characters are forced to act in ways contrary to what has been established in order for the author to force the plot into an ending that the audience wants. I have watched the movie several times, hoping to find hints that will make the ending believable, but I have yet to find them. However, there is enough to like about the movie that I do keep watching it.
I wish that the DVD had director's commentary or deleted scenes that might help explain how we get the ending. Oh well.
If you like this, then chances are very good that you will enjoy ""Trick"", ""Just One Time"", ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"", and ""The Opposite of Sex.""

I have seen the movie several times so there are some parts that I fast forward through now but overall it is a great film - one to throw into the DVD player when an escape from reality is called for.",998956800,3,321,4.03125
1049503,2,6305564450,"It's always disappointing to see a good child actor turned bad.  Mara Hobel (the young Christina in ""Mommy Dearest"") was terrific as a child but lost whatever acting talent to which she might once have laid claim.  The movie is passable as entertainment but not as a comedy.  The love story part of the movie seemed rather contrived and very predictable.  I really wanted to like it but alas, it was only so-so.",991612800,,411,4.589041095890411

1049505,4,6305564450,"This is a nice happy film with some unbelievable twists in its plot.  Even though the title is Broadway Damage, and this suggests some sort of trauma or dark goings on in New York, the film is pretty bright and cheerful throughout, even in its darkest moments.  The worst and most heart rending episodes have a happy ironic twist to them.  In this way it feels almost like a sitcom view of the world.
Fortunately, it's a pretty good sitcom.  The actors are all photogenic and likable.  None of the comedy is irritating or demeaning to the characters.  I enjoyed the film and enjoyed its candy eyed view of New York (even though the film does feature some seedy elements such as big rats, hustlers and snotty card shop employees).  However, nothing unexpected occurs in the film and the film breaks no new ground anywhere.  It is just pleasantly competent as it runs through its tried and true paces.
Definitely a nice undemanding gay friendly film to put on when you're in the mood to relax.",987033600,,991,4.590909090909091
1049558,4,6305564450,"This is not a great movie, but it is a good one, something light but not meaningless with 3 very good leads and a storyline that is somewhat predictable but touching nonetheless. I'm struck by how none of the reviews seem to single out Aaron Williams performance as Robert. The performance is a marvel of communicating sweetness, innocence, good-heartedness, and pining for love while trying to keep one's dignity. In lesser hands, it could have been cloying, but Aaron Williams manages to make Robert such a wonderfully loveable and real character that you keep wishing that Marc would ""get it"". Marc and Cynthia are also delightfully well portrayed - even if the dialogue is at times pat, they are very three-dimensional, real people.  The plot really does wander, quite badly in places, but the big ideas (in particular the ""grand gesture"") are well-thought out and nicely pulled together, and the happy ending doesn't seem completely contrived. If I have a problem with the movie, it's only that I find it impossible to see Robert as a wallflower - even with the porkpie hat and glasses, he's astonishingly attractive. I suppose it has to be this way - it's always easier to root for people who look good to you - but I think in real life, Robert would be flooded with admirers, not pining away. Still, given that he is so attractive, Aaron Williams does the best job he can of making Robert sweet but slightly geeky.  Anyone who's ever wanted someone ""out of their reach"" (and isn't that almost all of us) will relate this sweet film. It's a nice little treat at the end of a hard day or week, and it's especially nice to see a film about very real, non-hysterical, non-posing, non-""type"" gay men who are living in the real world (well, okay, in New York), not isolated in a gay ghetto.",976924800,6,1791,4.6645569620253164
1049559,5,6305564450,"I couldn't help but to think of Barbra Streisand as I watched this film.  In her best performances, Barbra  played the role of the ugly duckling who  falls in love with the handsome leading man (Omar Shariff, Robert Redford,  Jeff Bridges).  This movie follows a similar formula, where Robert is the  ugly duckling and Marc is the handsome leading man.
Robert has two  dreams: becoming a songwriter and landing Marc.  Likewise, Marc also has  two dreams: landing a role on Broadway, and finding a handsome boyfriend.  In addition to their friendship, Robert and Marc have one thing in common:  ""girlfriend"" Cynthia, who is trying to find a job (one job in  particular, that is).  Marc and Cynthia decide to share an apartment.  One  day, while staring out the window of their new apartment, Marc discovers  the man of his dreams (a musician with stunning good looks, of  course).
Marc explains to Robert the concept of the ""Grand  Gesture"".  Its when you swallow your pride, buy flowers or something,  and let that special person know you're in love with them.  Easy for Marc  to say, since he is good looking and popular with the gents.  Not so easy  for Robert, who gets turned down by the card store cashier.  Humiliated,  Robert gives up on good-looking boyfriends.
Here is where the story  varies from the typical Streisand plot.  While ugly-duckling Streisand  becomes the beautiful swan by using her voice, her talent or (in the most  fictional of plots) a makeover, Robert stays plain old Robert.  Can  Marc  see past Robert's dull exterior?  Can Marc see past the musician's  beautiful exterior? Will Robert get the courage to do the ""Grand  Gesture"" to Marc?
Those are the questions to be answered in  Broadway Damage.  By the way, what's with the title?  Alhough the movie  explains what ""broadway damage"" is, I'm not sure it was the best  choice for the title.  Personally, I would have chosen ""The Grand  Gesture"".
Back to Streisand...  If you love ""The Mirror has  Two Faces"", you'll love Broadway Damage.  If you hated  ""Mirror"", chances are you'll still like Broadway Damage, anyway.",968457600,33,2099,4.849002849002849
1049560,2,6305564450,"I expected trash, and was a little surprised. The female lead (who you will recognize as young Christina Crawford in Mommy Dearest) was a mundane  bore and then suddenly got in some great acting way too late in the film.  This film was quite true to the Manhattan living situation, which most  films ridiculously gloss over.  It is trying to do something fresh with gay  male romance, but the story wasn't strong or well-paced enough to have  washed anywhere but our gay ""We'll watch anyone who is cute and takes  off their shirt enough.""  Not at all sophisticated but it did create a  very authentic New York feeling.  A Surprise, but then my expectations were  low.",967334400,,667,4.663793103448276
1049561,4,6305564450,"I totally enjoyed this film.  After seeing so many dreary and depressing films with gay characters or dreary and depressing films about New York City, BROADWAY DAMAGE is a refreshing change-of-pace!  The performances are  all outstanding, especially Michael Shawn Lucas.  This film has comedy,  drama, romance, friendship.  It's simply a great ""feel good""  film...and what's wrong with that?",963014400,5,391,5.637931034482759
1049562,1,6305564450,"This movie would never have found any distribution had it involved heterosexual characters. As gay men, we are so hungry for representation, we will lower our standards to watch a movie with believable male  characters. Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming characteristics. The  saccharine pop soundtrack is cloying, and the generic West Village  characters are two-dimensional. The ending where the hunky actor finally  falls in love with his nerdy best friend is totally unrealistic. This movie  is the pits. If you want a nice gay romance movie, buy ""Lillies""  or ""Beautiful Thing"".",961718400,7,591,5.369565217391305
1049563,3,6305564450,"""Broadway Damage"" is a good example of how movie-making has  changed, yet stayed the same.  It depicts (relatively) happy gay men  resolving emotional/personal dilemmas without resorting to self-pity or  tragi-comic excess.  That alone is probably worth the price of admission,  if you haven't been won over by Hollywood's tepid courtship of  ""gay"" films.  Unlike most indie films written or marketed for the  gay community, ""Broadway"" is refreshingly free of socio-political  moralizing, even though the subject matter is rife with potential conflict  (classism being at the top of the list).
However, as a story it's a bit  long on ""grand gestures"" and short on substantive plot.  The  leads are stereotypes: the hunky guy who only wants what he can't have, the  mousey songwriter who can't assert himself, the Long Island princess who  doesn't know what to do when Daddy cuts her off.  The leads are all  likeable, in the sense that we all have friends who are screwed up and care  about them any way, but they don't inspire this viewer to feel anything  more than vague sympathy.
As a ""dating movie,"" this film has  it's fleeting charms, particularly if you're more interested in the date  than the film.  As a ""slice of life"" film, we've all seen it  before in some fashion.  Ultimately, if you just want to see a ""gay  film"" with a happy ending, this will fit the bill nicely.  But don't  be surprised if you find yourself dizzy from the rapid turnabout that turns  this into a ""feel good"" flick in the last twenty minutes.

1049565,5,6305564450,"Like a good Broadway show, this film has it all: a great-looking, talented cast; a clever story; memorable music; optimism; and a warm-hearted ending. Michael Shawn Lucas is perfect as Marc, a sweet hunk trying to make it as  an actor on Broadway. He goes to audition after audition, suffering  rejection after rejection. Hence,  Broadway 'damage'. His nerdy but cute  song-writing friend Robert (Aaron Williams) harbors a secret passion for  him, but hides it because handsome Marc is a perfect 'ten' and, therefore,  out of reach. Their companion Cynthia -- overweight and over-the-top -- is  played by Mara Hobel, no stranger to campy films. She played opposite Faye  Dunaway as Joan Crawford's daughter in 'Mommie Dearest', one of the great  camp classics of all time. The three friends share career problems,  relationships, and other personal traumas. They are loveable and a joy to  watch. When Robert finally makes his 'grand gesture' to Marc, he does so in  a wonderfully witty song (by Cindy Soltoff) which is sweet, bouyant,  touching, and tuneful enough for any Broadway show.

There are so few films of this genre (sad we even call  this a genre) that have a light-hearted feeling.  The script isn't an oscar  contender, but that didn't bother me.
