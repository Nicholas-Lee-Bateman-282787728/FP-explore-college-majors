8690645,1,B00Q7BC7JS,"The item description didn't make it clear that this is just a collection of episodes, and not a complete season.  Additionally, the seller failed to mention that it was also in French, and region locked to what I assume is actually France.  Even if I wanted to watch it in French, I'm not sure any of my devices is capable of playing it.",1462406400,,337,4.333333333333333
8690646,1,B00Q7BC7JS,"Star ratings don't really apply here but I gave it 1 star for a frustrating experience.  The description for this product said nothing more than Volume 4 - no episode list or any other info to go by - so, I made an assumption (which I know is a bad idea) and believed this to be the 4th season.

As it turns out this is apparently disc 4 in a multi-disc set for Season 2.  The episode list is:

Ski Trip
The Elevator
Matchmaker
Brain Drain
Fashion Faux Pas
Toying Around

Seems overpriced for one disc of six episodes.",1450828800,,518,4.191919191919192
