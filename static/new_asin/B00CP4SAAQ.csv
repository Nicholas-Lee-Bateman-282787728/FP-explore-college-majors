8584324,5,B00CP4SAAQ,A must see movie!,1408233600,,17,3.5
8584325,1,B00CP4SAAQ,"This is a low budget film shot with a hand held camera by someone who doesn't know how to operate a camera and most likely has never seen a movie. A group of guys decide to rob a bank, something we never see, just the planning. The planning consisted of extremely boring dialog and bad camera angles including the backs of heads, head cut offs and what are the doing now?

At one point the film attempts to be funny by using English subscripts for a guy talking slang, but it really wasn't necessary, nor was it as funny as when we saw it in ""Airplane.""

The film also lacks an on screen climax because Doug couldn't figure out how to make the inside of his apartment look like a bank.

It should be a crime to sell or rent this film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex talk. No sex or nudity.",1387929600,,787,4.19205298013245
8584326,1,B00CP4SAAQ,"Poor visual and poor audio with no substantive story line. Some of the guys are decent looking, Benny, Erik,and Kyle and this film ends there. No sexy shots of the guys, they tried a little bit with Scalco working out (hot body, okay face, should have had his shirt off throughout the movie).  The audio is grossly out of sync with the video. Too much ""bro"" talk for the ""wannabe"" cool kids. You can see the actual computer software panel of the film being edited (sloppy). You can also hear the audio dubbing. Too much audio with still frame shots of video of the inside of a dirty car . More meaningless and useless gratuitous ""bro"" talk, more, and more, and more. If you're going to make a movie this terrible at least have eye candy. A bunch of decent looking shirtless guys running around would have gotten you at least 2 stars, video and audio syncing would get you 2 1/2. Aside from the dubbing the most horrible point to this movie is it doesn't go anywhere neither in story lines nor in visual. People just standing around talking about a plan, no details of this ""plan"".",1384473600,,1080,4.454545454545454
8584327,1,B00CP4SAAQ,"Was this put on Amazon as a joke? It is NOT funny. The dialogue was out of sync, though it didn't take that for me to realize it was a first class piece of garbage masquerading as a motion picture. Please, for the love of all that is customer-centric, take this away and do not make available anything like this ---ever again!!!  Derrrrrrrp!",1383868800,,341,4.412698412698413
8584328,1,B00CP4SAAQ,Sound was not linked up properly ... Was like watching a poorly dubbed foreign film. This film deserves a  half star.,1383696000,,117,4.571428571428571
8584329,1,B00CP4SAAQ,You would be hard pressed to find a worst movie on Amazon. This movie was terrible. If you leave the sound off it might be better but I doubt it. Watching the difference between the soundtrack and the lip movement was horrible.,1383609600,,227,4.428571428571429
8584330,1,B00CP4SAAQ,"One reason I tried this movie was the 4.2 star rating for this movie.  I should have read them to see that a 5-star review was from the maker of this movie. I would rate this movie 0 stars if the system would allow me.

If you want to see a movie of guys BSing each other for one and a half hours, there has got be a better way than this movie!

The dubbing on this movie is terrible.  For most of the movie, sound followed an action or mouth movement 2-3 seconds after you see it. There have to be software packages that can get the sound synced with the movie closer than that.

Photography was terrible in places.  It had weird angles (an upshot of an actor's crotch while doing pull-ups and others), scenes of just the back of an actor for an extended period of time, and one scene has a few minutes of odd still shots of parts of a car that contains 2 actors while the actors go on and on about their sex lives.  In addition, somewhere in this scene, the color goes to black and white, going back to color at some time, it didn't seem related to the story.

I hung in their thinking that there would be a payoff when the actual robbery took place.  But, NOOOOOO, the credits run and you hear what is supposedly some of the sounds of the robbery under the credits.

I don't see how anyone could recommend this film.",1383436800,3,1319,4.137254901960785
8584331,5,B00CP4SAAQ,"Bank Roll rocks! Great story and great acting. This is one of those ""make you think"" movies.

What would you do, if you had to help a family member who had been arrested? How far would you go?",1383264000,,192,4.052631578947368
8584332,4,B00CP4SAAQ,"If you are looking for action, adventure, romance and suspense, then get another movie because Bank Roll is a slow-paced drama/comedy/independent film with unknown actors, but is actually quite amazing. The best way to describe it is ""weird"" and ""good"". It really made me laugh out loud at certain points where we had to pause and rewind things just to make sure I heard what I thought I heard. Almost the entire 90 minutes is dialogue driven where the bank robbers spend three days talking about everything under the sun except the heist they're doing. I kept forgetting it was a movie about a bank robbery as it felt more like Shakespeare in the park with swears! They DO rob a bank, I think. The way it ended made me scream, ""NO WAY!"" Then we listened to the cast audio commentary and I must say, I was a little disgusted and embarrassed. My husband, however, said this is his favorite feature. Guys were getting up to use the bathroom, they were all drinking and it's worth a listen if you like that sort of thing. We do and they did a great job. You almost don't notice the 3,000 F-bombs halfway in. My husband is in love with everything about Bank Roll. My son will not see this one until he is 17!",1379548800,3,1204,4.403587443946188
8584333,5,B00CP4SAAQ,"The 1st thing you're probably thinking is, ""5 Stars for your own movie -- IDIOT!"" I was going to give ""BANK ROLL"" 4 Stars, because 4 is one of my favorite numbers and totally understand that very few movies are ""perfect"", but when I hovered over the 4 Stars and saw the ALT text was ""I like it"" -- well, I love this movie and that's why I had to click 5. I don't think ""BANK ROLL"" is perfect, but I do love this movie.

We worked on ""BANK ROLL"" for over a year and shot it in 6 months. The actors never got to see a full script as we were making up the story as we went along. So we would run cameras on a weekend day one month and rough out an edit to help us make sense for the next month. We used a few lights on our big ""kitchen scene"" at the top of the movie where it jump cuts to introduce all the characters and after that, it just seemed fake. I'm not a fan of using stylized lighting tricks or light sources that aren't natural to their environment. I respect those types of looks and appreciate beautifully lit actors and walls in the background that pop, but we wanted ""BANK ROLL"" to be a little bit more realistic and we wanted things to move fast. I let the actors find their characters themselves, ran camera myself and we used one mic on a boom to get sound. Our crew was pretty much me and Johnny Scalco, one of the actors and the producer on this movie.

Our distributor picked up ""BANK ROLL"" after seeing the last 15 minutes of the movie at a film festival and requested 12 songs to be removed for this to work. All the music we used, we didn't clear or didn't have the rights to use. Without a song for the end credits, ""BANK ROLL"" feels super indie. With the music at the end, it had a ""Pulp Fiction""/""Swingers"" feel, or something more ""Hollywood"" -- we wanted ""Mony, Mony"" and the ""Mony, Mony"" people wanted over $20,000.00 to use that piece -- that was never going to happen in a movie that cost a little more than $700.00 for everything. We eventually figured it out and actually think no music adds to the style. So there you go. Maybe someday we'll George Lucas this thing and digitally stick all the music back into ""BANK ROLL"" so people can throw eggs at us. I honestly stand by this version. We spent a month on sound alone, and unlike a lot of independent films, you will not hear one pop or hiss or audio flub. It really was a labor of love. What we couldn't afford to put up on screen with money, we more than made up for it with hours and hours of time & energy. I'm not kidding, sometimes 48 hours straight editing with no sleep to get things perfect for the DVD release.

Okay, so that's all the stuff you may or may not want to know. As far as the DVD itself? We put in some extras that are not listed on Amazon, such as: 2 audio commentary tracks -- one with myself & Johnny and one with all 6 guys from the movie. There are a couple of deleted scenes -- one we scrapped because the camera was too shaky and one we did a re-shoot on. A blooper reel with flubbed lines, mic in the shot, that sort of stuff and a still gallery that PROVES we had no crew helping us make ""BANK ROLL"". My only regret is that I wish we took more pictures during the production. There's about a hundred or so, but hey. The next movie we do, we'll hire an on-set photographer.

Why should you spend your money on this DVD? Because ""BANK ROLL"" will teach you how to rob a bank! Really, though -- I think if you are interested in making movies, this is a pretty good one to see or study. I said it before and I'll say it again to drive home the point: we did the whole-entire thing (websites, pre-pro, production, post) for UNDER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. We won some stuff too! Best Dramatic Feature, People's Choice, Best California Feature...one of our actors took home a Best Supporting Actor Award, so it's nothing terrible. Before I dropped out of film school to pursue this career, I spent double or triple what this DVD costs on ""El Mariachi"", ""Clerks"" and other low-budget films on laserdisc with audio commentary tracks so I could learn some tricks that school maybe wasn't teaching and I wanted this DVD to have everything those laserdiscs had. Hopefully ""BANK ROLL"" will inspire you to get your movie going. You'll see that you don't need loads of equipment, tons of people helping, wads of cash to spend or mega-stars to make something fun & interesting for folks to enjoy.

And if you're just looking for a good movie that was made by a few people who love movies -- and I mean ""really love movies"" -- we put in the love 100% so we could get this DVD out to you. I speak for all of us who worked on ""BANK ROLL"" when I say, thank you in advance for your money, your 90 minutes of time and we look forward to reading YOUR reviews & commenting back on what you write about this 1st movie of ours...

Boogie,
Doug",1377216000,5,4827,4.190527448869752
