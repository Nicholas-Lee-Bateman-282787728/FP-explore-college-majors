They wasted time saying the SAME exact thing over and over, 5 or 6 times in EVERY SINGLE SEGMENT.

 WHO EDITED THIS THING, A MORON?

Two college educated adults, we NEVER got beyond the 6th segment on disc 1.

WHO EDITED THIS THING, A MORON?

There COULD be valuable information here BUT the umpteen ""sponso-mercials"" and the stroking of the author prevented it. What a shame his ego screwed the message. It appears that A LOT of work went into it.",1291766400,,473,4.5058823529411764
8150584,5,B000JJ4FIA,"I use this video all of the time when I present to teachers working with students of all ages and challeges (pertinent to autism, ADHD, LD, reading disorders, etc).  The video does an excellent job of helping viewers develop a comapassionate, informed, and constructive view of kids who display challenging behaviors.  The interviews with kids, accompanying handouts, and clear presentation of information makes this a great tool.  Oddly, I get great feedback on the value of the video from audiences except for the one part of the video where a teacher is interviewed and she appears anxious (her eyes are distrating to the content- so be prepared for those audience comments that only lead to discussion about communication styles/distractors). Great video for kids, parents, teachers, and audiences.",1284595200,,802,5.299212598425197
