3144713,5,B0015FQZIK,"Got this as a Christmas gift for my dad in 2008. While Street Fighter leaves much to be desired, my dad has loved having Time Cop, Hard Target, and The Quest in this set. No, it's not representative of any award-winning acting, but much like CSI Miami it is classic entertainment nonetheless.",1231804800,,292,4.634615384615385
3144714,5,B0015FQZIK,"There isn't much to say that has not already been said.  Van Damme is a rare artist in his field.  There are few actors today that can deliver such an engaging performance while roundhouse kicking the bad guys into oblivion.

Time Cop and Hard Target are the cream of the crop, and are worth the price alone.  The Quest was better than I expected; Street Fighter is clearly the runt of the pack, but not because of Van Damme's performance.",1229212800,,439,4.45
3144715,5,B0015FQZIK,Okay so Street Fighter might not be up there with HARD TARGET but it has its moments and sometimes delivers a laugh amongst the carnage. Timecop and Hard Target are easily worth the price of the set and The Quest was another good vehicle for Van Damme. An excellent choice if you are looking for some great action movies.,1229040000,,321,4.4576271186440675
3144716,3,B0015FQZIK,It was pretty good for a Van Damme video.  I have only seen 2 of the 4 on this DVD and am looking forward to seeing the other 2.,1226793600,,128,3.413793103448276
3144717,4,B0015FQZIK,"This four pack of movies is definately for fans of Van Damme!  The best movie of this set is Timecop, then Hard Target, followed by The Quest and Street Fighter.  There are some great fight scenes in the Timecop and Hard Target, but if you've never seen Bloodsport (a must see), The Quest is very similar to that in a cheaper way.  Street Fighter is one of thoose video game to movies, enough said!  Very enjoyable if you are a fan of Van Damme or you watch it with friends!",1226448000,,474,4.233333333333333
3144718,3,B0015FQZIK,"This is a great action pack - martial arts action, with some story line.
Bring back memories if you saw them the first time around.",1222992000,,131,4.28
3144719,5,B0015FQZIK,"Any movie where Jean Claude Van Damme has a mullet or travels through time is good in my book.  Timecop is actually not that bad a movie as I remember.  Hard Target is also good but Street Fighter looked silly to me.  I'm not in grade school so all of those movies like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter don't have the same effect on me.  The Quest looked dumb and it didn't hold my attention so I just turned it off.

Overall, this is a good buy and its def worth the price.",1222646400,,474,4.053763440860215
3144720,5,B0015FQZIK,"I already own all of J-C Van Damme's movies, but quite a few are old videos, some former rentals.  This quad movie pack freed up quite a bit of shelf space, all movies are in widescreen, no special features.

Hard Target and Timecop are my 2d and 3d fave Van Damme movies (#1 is Universal Soldier).  Both produced by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert.

Both are action movies.  Hard Target is directed by John Woo so you know there will be a dove and some good fights, all in slow motion.  It's the first time I remember seeing Arnold Vosloo, before he became The Mummy.  Lance Henrickson is also good in it.  You get a brush with Sam's brother Ted, but no Bruce.  One of J-C's better performances.

Timecop is an action sci-fi flick - J-C works for a security agency that polices time travel - very enjoyable.  You get to see quite a bit of Mia Sara, much matured since her day off with Ferris Buhler.

Street Fighter is more of an action comedy, although not all of the comedy was intentional.  Not my favorite movie.  I liked Raul Julia as an actor, but he was obviously very ill during filming - had that gaunt look - it was his last cinema release.  He mostly glares at people.  I don't know anything about the video games so no idea how the movie translated from them.  A bunch of hostages are taken, J-C and his army are trying to rescue them and stop their captor from gaining world domination.

The Quest reminds me of Bloodsport.  The reason could be that the story is by Frank Dux (on whom Bloodsport was based) and J-C (who starred in the movie).  J-C also directed.  Much like Bloodsport, you are there for the fights, not for the acting.  I don't think this movie is quite in the same league as Bloodsport, even though Roger Moore is in it.  How did that happen?  Is Timothy Dalton next?  But I did enjoy the fights.

I would recommend this movie pack.",1217203200,10,1860,4.334302325581396
3144721,5,B0015FQZIK,"I gotta say... I am very happy I bought this set... I did buy it primarily to get Timecop in widescreen... and I admit I was apprehensive about this... Frankly, I was afraid they would take the full screen version and simply cut off the top and bottom, like so many companies have done to ""create"" a widescreen version of their movies... but this version is true 2:35:1 widescreen AND it is dual layer and very good quality - even on the big screen plasma! I haven't watched the other films in the set yet, but I don't care... Timecop is excellent and finally it is here in widescreen... I recommend this highly and say thanks to the people who decided to give us true quality for the money we spent on this!",1213920000,14,708,4.330827067669173
3144722,5,B0015FQZIK,"And it's about bloody time.

My only purpose in writing this review is to confirm that at long last, we have a Region 1 version of Timecop in true anamorphic widescreen format. If, like me, you've been waiting for it for years, then I guess that'll be good news to you.",1211587200,28,269,4.2745098039215685
3144723,3,B0015FQZIK,"This is a 2 disc set. First disc consists of TimeCop  and Hard Target. Second disc consists of Street Fighter and The Quest. Hard Target and TimeCop are really good movies. Timecop is a futuristic movie. Hard Target is full of action. One of Van Damme's best. Unfortunately, Street Fighter and The Quest are a total disappointment. The directing and acting are awful. Street fighter, based on one of the most successful games in history--Street Fighter II-- does not follow the actual game script and the special effects are terrible. Most of the characters do not exhibit their powers with the exception of Bison. Copcom did a terrible job with special effects here. The Quest has really bad acting. It is a really bad version of Van Damme's first big movie BloodSport. It is basically about an international fighting contest. I give The Quest thumbs down all the way. The movies have no scene menus which is not good. There are no selection of scenes allowed.",1371427200,,961,4.789156626506024
3144724,4,B0015FQZIK,"This is a good collection of movies by Van Damme. I mainly purchased it for the Quest, but glad the other titles were included. They were entertaining as well.",1359849600,,159,4.517241379310345
3144725,5,B0015FQZIK,"The reason I bought the Quadruple Feature Van Damme Fight Pack was the movie Timecop. I loved the movie and was always disappointed that I could not find it in widescreen. I saw it on Amazon and bought it. It is a very good picture. It is good to finally see what is left out of the pan and scan, standard version. I think it is one of Van Dammes best. His acting is a little stilted, but better than good for an action film. The action sequences are great and also look better in this widescreen version.
Hard Target is on the same disc of this two disc set. It is John Woos first or second American movie. I was not exactly head over heels over his Broken Arrow with John Travolta and Christian Slater, his other early American effort. Hard Target is great action movie with Van Damme as a lonshoreman investigating the murder of a homeless man that is found later to have been hunted for profit. Lance Henriksen is the sinister head of this enterprise. He is great in the role, as always.  I would advise anyone to buy this collection of films, though I was not that happy with Street Fighter. It seemed cartoonish. The Quest I just could not get a handle on. I did not know where the film was going. The less said about the film the better. See it and make you own conclusions. The collection is great if only for Timecop and Hard Target. Buy it.",1359504000,,1350,4.2734375
3144726,5,B0015FQZIK,"I bought this DVD for my son; he loves it. It's great to have four movies on one disk. I also think these old movies are more appropriate, with less sexual content, less bad language, and a clear right and wrong, with the good guy fighting for justice.",1356652800,,252,4.270833333333333
3144727,5,B0015FQZIK,"I bought this set specifically because I wanted a widescreen version of ""Timecop,"" and I'm happy to say that the print quality in both sound and visual is excellent.  ""Hard Target"" looks just as good as it does on the previous DVD release.  These two films are easily the best of the Jean-Claude Van Damme features, with solid acting, plot, effects, and action.  Just these two films alone makes the set worthwhile.  However, the lesser-known ""Quest"" is great martial arts fun of the same stripe as ""Bloodsport"" or ""Enter the Dragon,"" where the hero has to fight a bunch of other martial artists in a tournament.

""Street Fighter"" is the weakest of the bunch.  If it were a B-grade action flick, the straight-to-cable kind like you used to see on ""Monstervision"" or the off hours of Cinemax, it would be fine.  However, the movie is completely unfocused, and the obvious ill health of Raul Julia is uncomfortable.  Because it was supposed to be big budget with pretty big names for 1994, it's not fun like so many B-grade mid-1990s action films are.  It's just bad, but it's no reason not to buy this set.  Skip ""Street Fighter"" and go straight to the other 3 films.  You won't regret it.",1300579200,,1188,4.636363636363637

3144729,4,B0015FQZIK,"Jean Claude Van Damme brings to the screen a combination of 007 adventure and

what it means to be a fighter again evil whether it is today, yesterday, or
tommorow.  This type of film is not for everyone; but, it certainly, filled a
nitch in my viewing habits; so, if you enjoy good against evil stories watch this

A movie about a video game based entirely on a fighting tournament, that doesn't have a fighting tournament, is a horrible idea.  The acting, the script, the action, all are very bad.  One of JCVD's worst movies.  Having said that...

Timecop is superb.  It's Back to the Future without the G rating.  Tons of action and the typical JCVD elements.

Hard Target is JCVD's foray into the John Woo world, where everything from a cigar to a snake gets a spinning kick.  It's over the top, but still pretty awesome.

The Quest is absolutely lights out.  Tons of similarities to video games, movies, and other fighting genre concepts, this one just rocks.  It's basically a hyper repeat of the movie that put JCVD on the map: Bloodsport.

This is a very worthwhile quadruple feature.  Watch the three good ones and enjoy them, then watch Street Fighter and play Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1392076800,,968,4.684523809523809
