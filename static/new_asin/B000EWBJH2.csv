2541505,1,B000EWBJH2,"It is very sad that Lions Gate released ALF in a syndicated version meaning that there is 4-5 minutes of original programming missing. Also it is sad that there are reviewers who give this 4 or 5 stars even though the program is not complete. To illustrate to those misguided 4 and 5 star reviewers next time you go to a baseball game stay for only for 7 innings, or when you watch your next football game watch for only 3 quarters. Or next time you watch your favorite program turn it off with 5 minutes left. We all know the show is very funny, the bad ratings is because of cut-up syndicated version. I will give all of you 4 and 5 star reviewers a  dollar, if you will use it to buy a clue.",1146700800,13,694,4.102941176470588
2541506,4,B000EWBJH2,"Even though it can't be bad, when the show is ALF i still think this is the worst season. The syndicate-thing isn't so bad even though, there are few episodes were some importent things are led out.

Watch for instents Wild Thing I mean how come Lucky is at the Ochmonicks, well that isn't hard to guess, but you know if you see the full episode.

But still there isn't bad not at all.",1145923200,,385,4.1891891891891895
2541507,5,B000EWBJH2,"i must admit the syndicated version is much better, u get more comedy for your buck.  Its annoying to see the producers of this dvd cut it up like that, but what can u do about it? just suck it up i guess, and buy the dvd's because there are no other means of getting such clear pictures whioch are also digital",1145491200,5,311,4.016129032258065

This is a great show and I feel they have done a great job with these D.V.D. sets. Stop crying and just enjoy the show.

2541509,4,B000EWBJH2,"yeah yaeh we know by now that the episodes are syndicated, but it's ridiculous to give away just 1 star just because of that. Even if there's a few minutes missing of every episodes; it's stilla great show and a joy to watch. I loved the first 2 seasons, even cut up. We all knew the third seasons was gonna be syndicated and I am willing to bet the fourth and final season too, but you know what...! Just live with it. There is never gonna be a uncut version on DVD since no one is going to publish a show again, thats already available on DVD and that also sold quite a lot of copies.",1145318400,4,586,4.060344827586207

2541549,4,B000EWBJH2,"I didn't realize that when I picked this DVD up that they were edited for syndication. Still I don't mind. I watched every episode with a delight and a smile at the end. I enjoyed the Tonight Show starring Alf as host.  Long before DVDs and instant watching, syndication was the way to see all the episodes.

There are five discs for 27 episodes. Alf was a hit in the late eighties on NBC and probably could have had a couple more seasons but the cast members were disgruntled over the long taping sessions and a puppet getting the best lines. I loved the cast and the crew for bringing some family entertainment.

If you want to remember some fond memories, the third season has Kate Tanner having a baby. Alf gets into all sorts of messes and trouble while trying to keep a low profile. If the cast and crew are reading this review, they have given light hearted family entertainment sorely missed almost 30 years later on television. Thank you, cast and crew of Alf for giving us the laughs and tears over the years.

This is family entertainment that everybody including children can watch and ask ""What's that?"" It's a VCR where we put tapes in to watch movies and television and phones were still on chords. I get nostalgic for the 1980s for the music, television, and the culture of the time period.

I deducted a star because these episodes are the syndicated versions and should be full complete episodes that aired and perhaps more clips of the show behind the scenes.",1410048000,,1478,4.541353383458647
2541550,5,B000EWBJH2,My husband is a big Alf fan. He had season 1 and 2 but could not find season three. I looked it up on Amazon and was able to order it for his Birthday. He absolutly loved it.,1406505600,,174,3.6052631578947367

2541561,2,B000EWBJH2,"If so, these DVDs are for you! Make no mistake -- ALF is a classic of the late 1980's. And season 3 is the best season of all of them. A bit cheesy, yes, but still very enjoyable. The show itself deserves at least 4 stars.

So why did I give it only two stars? Unfortunately, these DVDs contain the chopped up versions of each episode that you see in syndication. This means that they cut up each episode as it originally aired and left two - three minutes of it on the cutting room floor. That's a tenth of each episode. Worse, the scenes that were cut were mostly those immediately preceding or immediately following the commercial breaks on the originals, which means that many of the very best scenes got the ax. They did this so that more commercials could be added when the episodes played in syndication. But WHY, oh WHY, would they use these mangled versions on the DVDs, where of course there are no commercials?

Want the full episodes as they originally aired back in 1988 and 1989? You'll have to seek the European DVDs. These are invariably quite elusive and therefore very expensive. And they're Region 2, meaning you probably can't play them on a US or Canadian DVD player -- you'll have to rip them on your computer to watch them. But at least they let you watch the episodes the way they were intended to be enjoyed...",1389830400,,1335,4.444897959183673

2541574,5,B000EWBJH2,So Very Funny!  Rarely do TV shows make me laugh these days but the good old Alfer from not so long ago is a riot!!!  The writers are geniuses and they didn't have to resort to smut because their talents were enough.,1381104000,,216,4.119047619047619

2541576,4,B000EWBJH2,"Just to reiterate what others have said, I too was disappointed about these being syndicated episodes and the fact that they were put out of order in the set. My episodes run only 20 minutes before the closing credits kick in. Most syndicated shows run at least 22 minutes. So these feel really short. But my reason for the review is to list the episodes so you will know how they are ordered on the discs for Season 3.

Disc 1: 1, 3, 24, 6, 2, 4/5, 9
Disc 2: 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 10, 11
Disc 3: 13, 18, 14, 17, 25, 26, 19
Disc 4: 20, 22, 21, 5(from season 4!), 12(from season 4!), 23

2541607,5,B000EWBJH2,"Another season, and more episodes I have never seen....maybe because I was beginning high school?! Who knows, but ALF still brings it, laugh after laugh after laugh. This season shows more full body shots and the writing seems to have changed a bit, and the introduction music was different, as well. I still marvel at the puppet work, and it really is reminiscent of the Looney Tunes characters' facial expressions, which would say so much, even without words. ALF is no different in that respect, and his wit makes it that much better, as some lines seem to be impromptu. Go ahead & get your daily dose of ALF, the cure for the common frown.",1370649600,,643,4.6

2541692,5,B000EWBJH2,"I was so irritated when WGN canceled the retro Sunday night lineup. Fortunately, every show was available on DVD, including all the ALF episodes. It would begin at 7:00 and run until 2 AM. This is how I fell in love with ALF. Every Sunday I put this dvd series in and try to remember how good it was before they wrecked the line-up. That lineup had it all, for us classic tv fans; everything from WKRP to Bewitched and The Honeymooners, to name a few. I have never been able to convince the managers to start this up again. There was always the lame excuse of it coming down to decisions from the supplier. WHAT?? Since when does a buyer not call the shots. It's like me going into a store and the manager tells me I'm going to buy a SPEEDO or else. I wanted a pair of Levi's. I only wish that enough of us readers here could get together and insist that they bring back the classic line-up.
ALF has become one of my favorite shows and I'm hoping that they find some lost episodes. The acting ranges from so-so to excellent. I have to give the parents and the son a two star rating, as well as the neighbors, the Oggmonicks? Five star ratings go out to Andrea Elson, whom I never remembered as being such a ""babe"". Aside from that, try to catch her expressions of impatience and mild anger. Those looks are authentic. Then, lastly, there is ALF. He was 5 stars all the way! Although a character, his acting/voice were top-notch.",1343001600,,1428,4.312267657992565

I have several original broadcasts on tape and they all match up. As for the set up: the main menus are nill, simple numbers, no titles. The default language is of course in English and can be translated in others. The inserts are in German although, compared to the states' release, there's a description of each episode, ours doesn't have that. I bought the entire series in one box, and it has fur on it, lol. You can buy these individually of course. When I went to the German site (scroll to the bottom and you'll see the link) it offered translation, thank goodness. It took a little over a week for it to get here and that's standard shipping. So, it's worth a trip to German so to speak, I'm so glad I did.",1302652800,6,892,4.347305389221557

2541739,4,B000EWBJH2,"If you're looking at this review, it's because you are obviously interested in purchasing this DVD set.  Let me say, if you like ALF, do it!  This is the third season in what was a great television show.  While the acting by the human actors is kind of hokey, ALF makes the show worth watching.  The comedy is a little situational, a little slap stick, and a little punny.  It's a show that's safe for the family, and you should laugh out loud at least once every show.

As far as the DVD's go, there is a little left to be desired.  I would love to see more extras that pull back the curtain on the creation of ALF and some interviews with the people who starred in the show. The episodes seem to be out of order as Kate is pregnant for a while, then has the baby, then a few episodes later...SHE'S preggers again!!!

Overall though, this is a great purchase and loads of fun.",1168300800,3,877,4.209580838323354

2541741,4,B000EWBJH2,"I now officially own all the ALF seaons on DVD. I love love love the show and will happily continue to enjoy it for years to come. However, I have a complaint against Lionsgate (aside from the whole syndication issues) - the last disc of this season, they screwed up the order of the shows. Kate is pregnant, the baby is born, and then in the next episode they appear to have shoved the baby back in because she's pregnant again. Apparently when they edited this DVD, they didn't notice the discrepancy. I was only six when this season would have aired, so I have no idea if the shows were actually in that order, but I'm pretty sure the person making the collaboration put them in the wrong order. Otherwise it's a great set.",1161216000,2,726,4.385185185185185
2541742,4,B000EWBJH2,"Season 3 sees the show reach its peak as it begins to weave in more complex storylines amidst the comedic situations.  With two seasons behind them, Paul Fusco and the actors hit their stride and are completely comfortable with their characters.  Thus, there's a naturalness to everyone's performances.  Alf is for all intents and purposes real.  Also, with Alf's clumsiness and general mayhem more subdued (after being the focus for two seasons), the show is able to actually touch upon far more serious fair without sacrificing the traditional Alf style of humor.  Concepts such as losing (or clinging to)moral integrity (My Back Pages), fear of absolesence (Baby Love, Stairway to Heaven), abject loneliness (Alone Again Naturally, Standing in the Shadows of Love), catastrophic expectation (Shake, Rattle and Roll), and even grief and death (funeral for a friend).  Even those episodes that aren't as weighty have more complex and intresting elements, eg., ""Like an Old Time Movie"" which has Alf and Jake constructing a script starring the Tanners that plays out like an old silent movie (and brilliantly so); ""Have You Seen My Mother Baby"" has Jake confront his mother who he discovers is a thief; ""Running Scared"" deals with a blackmailer inside the FBI...  There's a lot of really good writing going on this season!

ALF was a show that always mixed somewhat childlike (or childish depending on your POV) low-brow humor with heart, but with the third season and the onset of far more somber themes, the show actually transcends its premise and becomes something much more affecting.  And as a result, the humor is that much funnier, emerging as it does from human emotions and situations.  Alf's fears of being the only one of his kind is genuinely moving; his concerns that we should savor life because we all might ""croak"" tomorrow is touching because it's real; his sorrow at the fact that a new infant in the house will leave him without any attention or love is understandable (it's also a great thematic continuity nod to the second season's episode about the lost dog.)

Some will complain because all they want out of the show are the more crass elements (Alf burping and breaking things), while others will deride the fact that the producers and writers even attempt to rise above the show's ""station"" as basically junk TV.  But what the critics fail to see is that ALF is essentially escapist entertainment -- and there is a place for that -- but not one without heart, and not one that can't at times touch upon the human condition.  And when the show does rise to more complex themes, it works and it works well, becoming funnier and more memorable.

The bottom line is that ALF is great family entertainment that won't leave you feeling brain-dead or like you've ingested too many sugar substitutes.  The only criticism is the DVD release itself which presents the edited syndicated versions (which had to cut some scenes to make room for more commercials.)  The show is still great, but it's unfortunate to not have the full versions.",1159056000,9,3055,4.891472868217054

2541770,3,B000EWBJH2,"I have been very tolerant with previous ALF releases.  They have all contained syndicated episodes.  I didn't care so much about the first season, because I just figured that since the show was no longer on TV, the DVDs were the only way to see the show.

Then the second season came out, again in syndication.  I bought it because the show still was not on the air.  Then I saw something shocking.  During one of the episodes in the second season, there was music substituted, and the episode was shorter than I'd seen on TV Land.  That was downright unacceptable.

So now we're at season three.  Syndicated episodes again.  This  time one episode ran for under 19 minutes!  I love ALF, and hate to see him get treated this way.

The episodes are all fantastic, and I'm still happy to own the DVDs, but the syndication thing has got to stop.

Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring pattern with TV show box sets.  The first season sets of both Roseanne and The Cosby Show were released in syndicated form.  No studio in the world would ever dream of releasing edited movies, so why would so many want to release edited TV series?  It's just wrong.

Season four will be out in September, or so I hear.  I will probably buy it just to complete the set.",1151020800,35,1256,4.4298245614035086
2541771,3,B000EWBJH2,"I used to love ALF in 1986 as an eight year old child and i still love it today.  It doesn't matter how old you are you will fall in love with the old Alfer either for the first time or all over again.  It amazes me that this series still holds up so well, it hasn't really dated (apart from the clothing, decour ect...) the idea of an Alien crash landing into a family's garage and staying with them is as appealing now as it was in 1986.  Alf the puppet hasn't dated, he still looks real, like E.T. still looks real, he hasn't dated. The one liners are still present, the jokes are still funny, the storylines are still watchable over and over again.  This series has 28 episodes, that's because two of the episodes are from series 4!!Fever and Mind Games! Can't Lions Gate get anything right?? This DVD loses two stars because this is the sydicated version, we don't have syndication in the UK, we call them repeats and they're always shown uncut. For instance friends must have been shown over 200 times in the Uk, everytime uncut.  Rosanne is uncut over here on DVD as far as i know. Alf hasn't been shown in England for many years though and i'm still waiting for his hit talk show to air or come to DVD.  Look, the truth is boycotting this DVD won't help, the studio will think there's no demand for the title and so they'll delete it and not order any more copies.  When somebody sugests releasing the episodes uncut then, the studio bigwigs will point out that the episodes have been released and didn't sell.  Maybe if we buy this and it sells a lot of copies they'll bow to presure and release the episodes uncut, but i doubt it, Lions Gate have stated that the original episodes are in bad condition and won't transfer well compared to the sydicated ones, although cutting the music and some of the songs makes it look like they don't want to pay for the rights to them.  And how come the Alf Files was released uncut?? I seriously doubt that they'll release the episodes again, so buy this and enjoy... this maybe the only chance a new generation has to get hooked on the wacky Alien like we did when we were younger.  I've ordered my copy and i sugest you do the same, these are some of the best AlF episodes ever made and if you're waiting for the uncut episodes, i'm willing to bet you'll be waiting a long time.  ALF is the best television series from the 1980's and is still hillarious today, cut yeah, but even that can't take away from the shows absolute genius!! I dislike the cut's too but some ALF is better than no ALF! Paul Fusco...hand your head in shame.  Why didn't you just put your foot down and demand the original episodes be cleaned up?? This is a great season, it's just a shame that some of the best material ended up on the cutting room floor...american networks make me sick, sydication, slam a few more adverts in there, make a bit more money.  As you can see this review is kinda up and down, that's how i feel though, i'm happy it's out but sad it's cut... Alf is 20 years old...we should be celebrating...not feeling sad about these releases, it's amazing that this show was even made with it's ofbeat concept.

ALF is a refine taste. Like Jerry Lewis or Mel Brooks, its the slapstick with a reflection within the laugh. The jokes are hit and miss with so many running gags, you will laugh.

my favorite episode on this set  was Tonight Tonight..This is where ALF guest hosts for Johnny Carson (the host before Jay Leno).  The Tonight show cast of Ed Macmahon and Tommy Neuson played along for laughes. Alf tries out the Carson characters of Art Fern and the Great Carnack.
