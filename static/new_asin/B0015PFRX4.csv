8259373,3,B0015PFRX4,Not really my kind of story but I thought I'd try it anyway. Overall it has good characters and an interesting story idea. A bit violent and choppy though. There were times I really wasn't certain where in the story I was. Some rather sudden changes in the story left me wondering a few times if I'd missed something somehow. Some nudity and several suggestive scenes. I wouldn't recommend it for children. I don't generally have a problem with some nudity but it can become a bit too much in a few places. Mostly due to the scenario. It may be what the director and producers were after but it seemed unnecessary at times. Not as bad as it might have been but not as good as I wanted it. Probably just my personal taste so I wouldn't write it off entirely if you like supernatural romance but approach with caution.,1474675200,,816,4.410596026490066

8259381,5,B0015PFRX4,"I am very happy I purchased this anime! It is kinda a hard one to find and so far I am loving every minute of it. Definitely would suggest it to anyone who enjoys classic, hand drawn anime, the best kind in my opinion.",1434931200,3,218,3.977272727272727
8259382,4,B0015PFRX4,I remember seeing this anime back a long time ago.  It was pretty good and though there are differences from the manga I can say the anime was still good recommend this to anyone looking for old anime since they sure don't make anime like this anymore.  The story is about a teenage girl named Aya who at her sweet 16 really has her life go upside down.  Her family is trying kill her because of some ancient family curse and things go really more wrong from there.  Also some celestial being is going into her body.,1434931200,2,516,4.288659793814433
