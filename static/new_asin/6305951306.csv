It should not even be listed on the website under those circumstances. Particularly after I TOLD Amazon why I was returning it. I just watched it on NetFlix.....,1505952000,,320,4.262295081967213

In  fabulously filmed scenes of the Italian vineyards, the set brings you the  flavors of both the wine and the cultural traditions of Italy.
