3089365,4,B0012GVKV4,"It's Cartoon Network's second live-action movie and it's a really great one, too !

""Ben 10: Race Against Time"" has Ben (played by Graham Phillips) back in his hometown of Bellwood.  Even though he's back in school and leaving his hero adventures behind him, it seems that Ben will be facing his greatest challenge yet.  An evil alien named Eon has risen and seeks Ben and his Omnitrix.  Now Ben - along with Gwen (Haley Ramm), Grandpa Max (Lee Majors), and the last remaining ""Plumbers"" - must defeat Eon once and for all or the entire world is doomed !  Experience the movie and its great effects, plus see Ben turn into some of your fav alien heroes like you've never seen them before !

Also on this cool DVD, there are lots of behind-the-scenes bonus features like interviews with the cast and more !

One more thing for all you Ben fans out there: don't miss the new series ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" premiering real soon !  It's gonna be really cool !",1207267200,13,952,4.431034482758621

Ben 10 is about ten-year-old Ben Tennyson's discovery of a device called the Omnitrix that allows him to change his form into that of ten aliens. Hence the name of Ben 10. The plot revolves around an alien known as Eon. Grandpa Max tells Ben that Eon was the first alien the Plumbers(a group he is part of) ever faced, and that they thought they'd locked him up. Instead, when Grandpa Max leads the kids there, they find out Eon has escaped. Grandpa Max feels that Eon will be after his doomsday device known as the Hands of Armageddon. Heatblast, Wildmutt, Diamondhead & Grey Matter were the only alien forms presented in the movie and were a real blast to see. I really loved the movie myself. It does the series justice. I wish Cartoon Network would make more movies of Ben 10 or a live-action tv series...it would definitely be cool if they did.

The movie stars: Lee Majors, Graham Phillips, Haley Ramm, Christien Anholt and Robert Picardo. It clocks in at around 90 minutes and is the most fun you'll ever waste your time on. I really liked this movie and plan to get into the series alot more. Check it out!!!",1215648000,9,1313,4.516806722689076

Ben 10 is about ten-year-old Ben Tennyson's discovery of a device called the Omnitrix that allows him to change his form into that of ten aliens. Hence the name of Ben 10. The plot revolves around an alien known as Eon. Grandpa Max tells Ben that Eon was the first alien the Plumbers(a group he is part of) ever faced, and that they thought they'd locked him up. Instead, when Grandpa Max leads the kids there, they find out Eon has escaped. Grandpa Max feels that Eon will be after his doomsday device known as the Hands of Armageddon. Heatblast, Wildmutt, Diamondhead & Grey Matter were the only alien forms presented in the movie and were a real blast to see. I really loved the movie myself. It does the series justice. I wish Cartoon Network would make more movies of Ben 10 or a live-action tv series...it would definitely be cool if they did.

The movie stars: Lee Majors, Graham Phillips, Haley Ramm, Christien Anholt and Robert Picardo. It clocks in at around 90 minutes and is the most fun you'll ever waste your time on. I really liked this movie and plan to get into the series alot more. Check it out!!!",1215648000,9,1313,4.516806722689076

8245985,2,B0012GVKV4,"It's great movie, kind of slow and didn't keep younger kids attention due to not cartoon. But my 6 year old loved it.
 I  wasn't happy with the fact I bought new and it came in the wrapper, BUT it was still scratched all over the dvd..not  sure if shippers fault or factory fault. I did not return due to the hassle of it and it was my son's Christmas present from santa. You get what you get when order online.",1455408000,,411,4.049382716049383
