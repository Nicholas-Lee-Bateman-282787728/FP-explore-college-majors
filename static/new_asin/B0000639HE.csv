7958824,5,B0000639HE,"There MUST be two different versions of this- which is entirely possible, since the covers look slightly different in different photos (one is a little darker than the other).

Mine has the original soundtrack- and I treasure it greatly. (I don't want to ""steer anyone wrong""- but that's my personal experience with this.)

Mine is the version with 21 episodes on it.",1423526400,,367,4.903225806451613

7958826,1,B0000639HE,"I don't know who was responsible for this re-dub, but yes this is a total let-down WELL pointed out by others here!  Instead of messing around with the classics for a new effect, why not try to edit some of the inconsistent storylines and put them together? Too and Loo, Moon Trip, Robot Rumpus, etc.  That is what I always didn't get as a child why the same episodes all seemed to have storyline pieces all over the place!

My suggestion to appease? Maybe make a special feature available like many DVDs do and offer ""Original soundtrack"".  If the original scores aren't that great any more THEN have the re-dubs offered!

I want my Gumby to have the funny girlish voice when I expect it and corny background music!  You don't even have the robots making the right mechanical noises in Robot Rumpus any more!!  There really should be a warning on the boxes about this!  All I could see in the details was something about ""original anomalies"" about the film quality!",1176681600,2,966,4.575581395348837
7958827,1,B0000639HE,"If you loved the original Gumby then don't buy this item.  It will only break your heart.  None of the original voices, music, or sound effects are used in this DVD.  All the sound is re-recorded and has none of the charisma or excitement as the original sound I loved as a kid.  I can still hear the original funky sound effects in my head, and when I heard the sound on this DVD, I was shocked and dissapointed that I had wasted my money.  As far as I know, all the episodes are here and in good quality, however without the original sound it is not the Gumby I saw as a kid.  DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.",1096761600,19,599,4.033898305084746
7958828,1,B0000639HE,It's ok... but the synthesizer track is a disgrace to Gumby fans.  I don't understand why Rhino couldn't have used the original.  It's very disappointing.  THE ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST.  I would discourage Gumby fans from buying this release and to hunt down the older copies from Family Home Entertainment.,1065398400,18,310,5.019607843137255
7958829,4,B0000639HE,"Art Clokey was 33 years old , when he first crudely created the classic clay-mation character that would be embraced and loved by generations of children and then satirized by Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live and re-discovered by grown-ups and kids.
Get ready folks, it's a Gumby World all over again.  Rhino has released a comprehensive 7 disc DVD Gumby set which collects all of the 130 original Gumby TV. show segments.  The first short segments were shown on the Howdy Dowdy show in 1956.  Then they became ten minute episodes and a weekly children's program in 1957.  The show kept running until the late 1960's when it just seemed too low-tech and simple for modern audiences.  Gumby was almost forgotten until  David Sheffield and Barry Blaustein wrote a comedy sketch for Saturday Night Live and Eddie Murphy in the mid 1980's.  The idea of the sketch was, what if innocent, nice guy Gumby on screen was really a cynical, rather nasty character in real life.  It was funny and it also reminded people of the American Icon they had grown up with and almost forgotten-- Gumby.
Art Clokey's Gumby was re-born, and millions were made throughout the 1980's and 90's on toys and videos and syndication and there was a new digital Gumby created.  There was even  Gumby: The Movie.  But this new slicker Gumby didn't have the charm and magic of the original simpler cruder clay-mation episodes made by Clokey in the 50's and early 60's.
Worry not Gumbiacs and Gumbiphiles, Rhino has done a very good thing for everyone who pined to go beyond the Time Warp and travel via the Way Back Machine to a time when balls and slabs of colored clay came alive and were transformed into Gumby and Pokey , Prickle and Goo.
GUMBY VOLUME 1
The first volume of treasures from the world of Gumby includes the earliest episodes of the t.v. shows in which Gumby and his pals travel to the Moon, go through mirrors and into story-books (to battle the block heads), reason with over zealous Gophers, stop bullying black knights, battle crazed toys and much much more.
The animation is simple and pretty crude.  The sound-effects are sometimes bizarre. (some but not all have been re-recorded)  Watching the episodes for the first time in at least 25 years I was amazed at how surreal  it all seemed.  Innocent perhaps, but there is a wealth of creative oddness to be witnessed in these earliest of Gumby episodes.  Clokey had a wild imagination and sometimes the narratives of his little stories would be set aside if he had come up with an interesting visual ideas. Ideas crudely realized on sets improvised out of art store supply materials, erector sets and available toys. Sometimes it doesn't make much sense at all-but who cares.  Someone who didn't know about Gumby might look at these episodes and wonder if they were strange LSD inspired dream sequences from Cheech or Chong movies or part of the Requiem for a Dream film.
No, this is Gumby, the charming clay creature that Art Clokey designed quickly as part of a thesis film he was making for his film class in 1953.  He had limited funds and tried clay animation.  The short student film he created with more than 4,0000 set ups, a jazz score and no dialogue was called Gumbasia mostly after  Disney's Fantasia.  A film producer Sam Engle  (who's son Art was tutoring) saw and loved the short film in 1954 and thought Art Clokey might create a wonderful children's show for tv with this clay- mation creation of his.  Engle (who was also the president of the Motion Picture Producers Association) financed a pilot.
Art Clokey also designed and created the well regarded  Davey and Goliath series which recently had some episodes released on DVD too.
Art Clokey's favorite color was Green.  Gumby's bell bottom legs came about to keep him balanced.  The shape of his head was meant to resemble a 1910 photograph of Art Clokey's dad who sported a fancy pompodour hair style in the photo.  The original concept was inspired by The Gingerbread Man, the early voices were performed by Clokey's wife and then later by professional actors doing voice over.
 The appeal today is in enjoying the simplicity and crudeness of the segments coupled with the mind boggling creativity, imagination and ideas that poured out of Clokey's
brain.
  Gumby is presented in the original 4:3 broadcast aspect ratios.  The transfers were made from the original 16 M.M. masters and while they look very good, there are plenty of blemishes and flaws to be seen.  The colors are not overly bright and never were.
The DVD's audio is mono and there's plenty of 'noise' and hiss on the track.  But you know it shouldn't be any other way.  These segments were originally seen by people on crude black and white television sets with tinny little speakers.  The new 80's Gumby theme is used on menu's and in intros which is a let down.  When the 50's electronic music is used (part of the time) it's remarkable how ahead of its time it was.
There are no DVD extras on Gumby Volume 1.  Those are on later and slightly less interesting volumes of the series.
Hey, It's a Gumby World.
Or as Eddie Murphy once said,  ""I'm Gumby, da[r]nit !""

7958830,3,B0000639HE,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer. I just got this Gumby DVD and was expecting to be thrown back into a nostalgic past but this new soundtrack completely ruins the experience. I wasn't aware this new soundtrack was made in 80's. I used to watch Gumby on television during the late 80's after school and I don't recall hearing this synthesized soundtrack. I think the picture quality is okay but I cant understand why they had to use this new music. I would suggest that if you must have a Gumby DVD just buy this Volume 1, do not get the whole box set, you'll only be dissapointed 10 times over. I hope someone re-considers and re-releases this set with its original soundtrack restored. It's a sad day in Gumby ville until then ;(",1021248000,6,743,4.511111111111111
7958831,1,B0000639HE,"Unfortunately, cheap-sounding synthesizer music has replaced the original Gumby music.  New voices and different sound effects also detract heavily from the audio experience.  A new bright-red and oily-looking Pokey announces each new episode instead of the original ""A Gumby Adventure"" intro, which was also removed.  This DVD is specifically ""Not Recommended"" until Rhino releases the original, complete version.",1020988800,7,414,6.103448275862069
7958832,3,B0000639HE,"This is disk one of the seven-disk box set and gathers 21 of the oldest Gumby shorts. Great material and highly nostalgic, but... (1) I realize that the original films are about 40 years old now, but a little more restoration could have been done. The picture clarity is fine but the scratches and spots could have been fixed without too much trouble. (2) The synthesized background score that is heard on many of these films was added in the 1980s. Did no one save the original scores? If so, couldn't/shouldn't they have been used instead? Those of us who remember growing up with Gumby in the 1960s will experience a little discomfort from an audio perspective. Those who grew up watching Gumby in the 1980s won't object, I suppose, but I think part of the considerable charm of these shorts has been lost. Rhino rarely puts its name on shoddy product, but there's been a slip-up here. This DVD is recommended with regrets.",1020470400,19,926,4.652439024390244
