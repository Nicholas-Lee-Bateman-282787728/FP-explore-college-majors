6979827,5,B00SC4VTHE,"What a great workout!  I've done one of Amys's other workouts and it was pure cardio.... and tough! When I saw she came out with a workout that included some strength,  I had to have it! I'm so glad I did! Everyone is different but my first time doing this 55 minute workout, I burned 515 calories. The first half was a little slow and it was tiring to hear amy talk so much but the last half picked up pace. Usually I do Cindy Whitmarsh, Jackie warner, Kelly coffey-meyer and Jillian Michaels And Amy is just as great!",1431216000,5,519,4.232323232323233
6979828,5,B00SC4VTHE,"I do a lot of workout videos and I have to say that I find Amy Dixon to be the most unique in what she puts together and the most enthusiastic and likable trainer. I expect excellent quality from her videos and was not let down by this one, in fact I think this may be my favorite of all the Breathless Body videos. While I have liked her tabata workouts, to some degree, I find them boring so this video was particularly unique and a style that I really hope she produces more of - 45 sec compound exercise performed with light weights and then 30 sec same compound exercise performed with heavy weights and then 3 quick bursts of a cardio move. Like others have said in their reviews, the cardio section is not as intense as some of her workouts but you can either not take the rest periods or just appreciate the fact that this is a full body conditioning workout without being killer on the cardio component. I sweat consistently throughout the video and felt really satisfied at the end. I think Amy is really good at designing unique workouts that do not involve complicated choreography (which I hate and often complain about in other work out dvds). This is truly a fun workout that I am going to consistently use and there are a lot of ways to play with the level of intensity and modifications. It is my hope that Amy churns out a few more dvds in this style because I love combining periods of weight lifting with cardio bursts. I also love that Amy is no ego - like she really manages to come across as inspiring and supportive while acknowledging going at your own pace. I love her!",1430784000,4,1595,4.355704697986577
6979829,4,B00SC4VTHE,"I have all four of Amy Dixon's Breathless body workouts now. I get incredibly excited every time she comes out with a new workout DVD as she is engaging and encouraging without being irritating. I enjoyed this workout yesterday, but I think it will take at least another time through in order to get the weights correct.

The workout starts with a warmup, and actually includes short segments of interval training within the workout which was a first. She then goes into 8 rounds of new moves. To her credit, each of these 8 segments are different than moves seen in her other workouts. For each round, you do the move for 45 seconds using a light weight, have a 15 second break, then do the move for 30 seconds with a heavier weight. After that, you do a cardio version of the same move for 3 times, 15 seconds each time with 15 second breaks. Then you move on to the next round.

What I really appreciated about the new format is that I never got bored. Sometimes Tabata style drills can have a dread factor because you really have to mentally keep yourself going when there is no movement change. This DVD did not have that problem, and I was honestly surprised when Amy announced that there were only 3 rounds to go. I also appreciated that the burst at the end, where she combines all of the cardio moves, was only 2 minutes total because each move was only done for 15 seconds. The workout also ended with a 5 minute abs section, 1 minute per move. It was a nice way to continue the workout while slowing down the heart rate.

What could have used improvement for me was understanding what weight a ""light weight"" and ""heavier weight"" are. The workout actually started quite easy for me and I think this was because I didn't use a heavy enough light weight for the first exercises. I used 5 and 8 pound weights throughout. The moves definitely got harder as the workout continued, and I think it's just going to take some time to know what I need to use. Amy also does less explanation of the new moves and pretty much only does a tiny demo of the medium level drill, which is what I typically do as well. Nonetheless, I normally like seeing what the other options are, so that if I feel tired or want more of a challenge I can switch.

I did the workout for the first time yesterday and am minority sore today. I will definitely do it more, and I expect my liking of the workout will improve as I get it structured exactly as I want.

Overall, I would rank this DVD third in order of her HIIT workouts. My favorite is HIIT 3, second favorite is HIIT2. My least favorite is her first workout which is a great workout, but highly repetitive.",1429401600,29,2646,4.348178137651822
6979830,5,B00SC4VTHE,"This has been out of stock for too long so i found it on EBay at totalfitnessdvds store.

I have all 4 of her Breathless Body DVDs and this is my favorite.  It seems they get better and better. The 1st one is my least favorite because there is too much repetition - it's tabata style which I love but it was too many rounds (like 7) of the same drill in a row.  BUT the rest of the series is great!  Love the addition of weights.  If the weight segment isn't hard enough, increase the weight.  This is a nice sweatfest!",1428969600,5,519,4.03921568627451
6979831,5,B00SC4VTHE,"I did this for the first time today and honestly loved every minute of it! i was hesitant to buy it,as I didn't care for the other Breathless dvd's(I'm really not a fan of Tabata style workouts,hiit style workouts or all cardio.what sold me on this was the combo of strength&cardio. I also hate workouts that have a lot of reps of the same excercise,as I find myself watching the clock. I only have good dvd's in my workout collection ,mainly because if a dvd has serious dread factor for me,I won't waste my time doing it again,no matter how highly rated the dvd is(p90x,junk fusion,insanity,etc.)This workout had no complicated moves,no annoying instructor,and I loved all the excercises. I was drenched when done,yet energized. I only workout at home to dvd's and have been for many years-I am 48 now.i highly recommend this! I can't wait to try it again-now that I have an idea what the moves are,I can challenge myself with heavier weights.",1426896000,6,945,4.733333333333333
6979832,5,B00SC4VTHE,"I don't normally love weight videos because I find they're not challenging enough - and this would be the same thing if I only had one set of weights at my disposal. Using light weights is a waste of time - so I ended up using 5 different sets of weights which varied by exercise. In that case though, it made it a really challenging workout because I could push myself with the heaviest weight I could personally lift for that exercise.",1426032000,5,437,4.341463414634147
6979833,5,B00SC4VTHE,"As always, Amy Dixon doesnt disappoint. In her fourth Breathless Body DVD she incorporates weights, which is a twist from the first three. Thats one of the perks of this series: they all offer something different. Some are harder than others, but all can be modified to any fitness level.

In Going Strong, 45 seconds of light weight work is followed by 30 seconds of heavy weight work and then three short, high-intensity cardio bursts. This pattern repeats itself for eight circuits which is then followed by a quick run-through of all eight cardio moves and finally core work and a stretch. Although not as challenging as some of the other Breathless Body workouts, your heart rate stays up throughout, and every body part gets worked. As always, things can be modified. If you want more weight work, use heavy weights for both weight segments. If you want more cardio, keep going during the short rests in between cardio bursts.

I can see myself reaching for this DVD often, and at 55 minutes, its easy to fit into a morning workout.",1423440000,10,1038,4.7292817679558015
6979834,5,B00SC4VTHE,"This workout is one of my favorite Amy Dixon videos so far - and I love all of them! It combines two levels of strength intervals (45 seconds of a lighter weight, repeat set for 30 seconds with heavier weight) with cardio in between the strength intervals. It flies by! You will definitely need two sets of weights - I used 10's and 15's. I may dial it back next time and use 8's and 12's though, because my form wasn't the greatest trying to use the 15's on the second sets. You definitely won't regret purchasing this one.",1423180800,14,524,4.303030303030303

8698059,3,B00SC4VTHE,"Cons:  Not for someone who has osteoporosis - too difficult.
Pros:  Even though I couldn't really keep up, I slowly carried out the exercises and did work up a sweat and felt I got a decent cardio workout.",1485820800,,205,4.368421052631579
8698060,5,B00SC4VTHE,I really like Amy's Breathless Body series of DVDs. This one is probably my favorite. The HIIT training dvd is great also.,1479513600,,122,4.590909090909091
8698061,3,B00SC4VTHE,"I have all four of the Breathless Body series and this is my 2nd to least favorite.  While I like the format of the Strength/Cardio circuits, I don't think Amy chose the best strength exercises.  Many of them were awkward,( ie, the plank position with weights), and had potential to cause injury if one isn't careful.  I did like the cardio segments, and love Amy as an instructor.  My favorite out of the Breathless Body series is Breathless Body 2: The Edge and #3: Hiit it big.  I'm going to try ""Double Down"" as that one had good reviews.",1471478400,4,542,4.434343434343434
8698062,5,B00SC4VTHE,"Love this W.O. - first 40 min is warm up & weights and last 20 is abs and cool down. You can use no weights, light weights or switch to really heavy when she does but you have options to stay with light weights.",1450137600,2,211,3.8181818181818183
8698063,5,B00SC4VTHE,"Awesome workout! You put in the work and you will get results. Amy is tough but an encourager and she makes you want to ""go the distance."" This is definitely one of my favorite combo strength/quick cardio workouts!!!!",1447200000,,217,4.7368421052631575
8698064,5,B00SC4VTHE,"I have all of Amy Dixon's breathless body DVDs, and they are all challenging and sweat inducing. This one may be my favorite. I appreciate the addition of weights with this workout. If you haven't tried Amy Dixon before, I suggest trying this workout. You won't be disappointed.",1446336000,2,278,4.8125
8698065,5,B00SC4VTHE,"I am a little biased as I love almost everything Amy Dixon.  There are a few awkward moves, but I just improvise.",1445472000,,113,4.136363636363637
