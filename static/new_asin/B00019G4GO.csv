8008795,4,B00019G4GO,"This is a single-sided DVD containing the following three films: 1) 'St. Benny The Dip'; 81 minutes, b&w; Dick Haymes, Nina Foch, Roland Young (Topper); Three con men pose as ministers to elude the police, but their new identities have unexpected effects on them. 2) 'Behave Yourself!'; 80 minutes, b&w; Farley Granger, Shelley Winters, William Demarest, Lon Chaney Jr., Hans Conried, Elisha Cook (What a cast!); Bill is followed home by a friendly Welsh terrier his wife Kate mistakes for an anniversary gift, little dreaming that Archie, the terrier, has been trained as a go-between for rival factions of smugglers. 3) 'Topper Returns'; 87 minutes, b&w; Roland Young, Joan Blondell, Billy Burke ('The Wizard of Oz'; Glenda, the good witch of the North), Carole Landis; When one woman is mistakenly killed in place of a wealthy socialite, it is up to Cosmo Topper and the woman's ghost to catch the killer.--This is a great deal for some classic comedies that are also family appropriate; of course, some may not feel comfortable with the supernatural element of 'Topper Returns'. Do not expect the highest quality from this collection, three movies on one single-sided DVD, but for three classic comedies, and two of them featuring Roland Young, I found it to be a good deal.--Bob",1102032000,13,1283,5.028169014084507
