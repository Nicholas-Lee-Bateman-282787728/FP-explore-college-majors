8179742,5,B000NO3DKW,"Loosely utilizing the vignette format of 1967's  ""A Guide for the Married Man"", this movie stars Cybill Shepherd as ""Julie Walker"", a woman who has become bored with both her husband and the ""housewifery routine"" and is seeking something else to feel alive again - with that ""something"" being an affair. Consulting her friend Maggie (Barbara Feldon), Julie considers the possibilities and pitfalls of finding the right man who can bring the spice back into her life. Julie has many doubts about it - but will she go through with it? Sorry, no spoilers here.

While this is not Emmy award winning, must-see-TV material, it's a fun diversion and a interesting glance back at the era in which it was filmed.. For Cybill Shepherd fans, she looks lovely here and wears quite a few great outfits. Altogether, it's a light watching, enjoyable way to spend a bit of time on a lazy afternoon.",1469923200,,883,4.764705882352941

8179744,5,B000NO3DKW,"I enjoyed this 1978 TV movie, I think it teaches a lesson about being happy with what you have and the need to communicate to make a your relationship a success. A welcome cast of familiar faces make this one worthwhile. The quality is superb. Here's hoping more 70s TV movies make their long awaited debut on DVD.",1445904000,,314,4.431034482758621

8179747,2,B000NO3DKW,"I have to say that I'm disappointed but the film was made for television and depicted the time period of the late seventies. Cybill Shepherd plays a married housewife and mother of two children in Los Angeles, California. She is bored with her life. The cast is first rate with plenty of familiar faces from television.

At first, her life looks great with a loving devoted husband and two decent kids. She lives well in the suburbs. Her friend notices that she's ready for an affair after all that's what happens when the romance from marriage has been sucked out. The film is somewhat lame at times. It tries too hard to be cutting edge for the time period.

I bought this DVD because I wanted to see Bonnie Franklin but she is only in it for a minute. Cybill's character tries so hard to avoid having an affair. She wants to the good wife and mother. Her friends have all fallen off the wagon of monogamy.

The film has a wonderful cast but poor writing to keep the film's momentum. The ending was too far fetch for me. The film was only worth it for Bonnie's cameo appearance.",1416960000,2,1080,4.417085427135678

8179751,5,B000NO3DKW,"I saw this movie when I was probably a preteen and it made quite an impression on me. It's all about adultery and what happens when people get bored in their marriages. Cybil Sheperd's husband starts having an affair, she finds out and starts having fantasies about every man she meets and whether or not she should be messing around too. It's very 70's but I found it to be very funny and Cybil looks great in it. It has a great supporting cast and the guy who plays the husband is gorgeous.  I still remember the theme song - ""Nothing Stays the Same."" I highly recommend this movie to people who want to see a good, lighthearted comedy.",973555200,9,638,4.361344537815126
