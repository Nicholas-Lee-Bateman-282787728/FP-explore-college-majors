8360961,3,B002BB701S,"With the WWE seemingly churning out the same stories and superstars every month, TNA began to make their mark in all the areas the WWE saw fit to ignore. Suddenly, tag team wrestling was a premiere attraction and women's wrestling wasn't too far behind. By God, they must've said, these kinds of things can draw money! And so TNA walked into ""Sacrifice"" with a blooming tag team division and a competive group of women who knew how to wrestle.

And, once again, those are the areas where the show delivers: the women have two matches on the show that did a good job developing two important stories. Neither are great matches in the technical sense, but Angelina Love/Awesome Kong and the women's Monster's Ball match both led to bigger, better things in the coming months. On the flip side, two tag team matches stole the show! First, the opening six man match featured Lethal Consequences teaming with Eric Young against The Sheik abd the Motor City Machine Guns in a fast paced, 15+ minute extravaganza and then Beer Money fought The British Invasion in the finals of an Invitational Tournanent. Both were great matches that blew everything else out of the water.

The rest of the show wasn't terrible, but it wasn't particularly memorable either; the main event featured a four-way brawl between Sting, Foley, Angle and Jarrett where everything was hindered by TNA's unclear stipulation where each man had to ante something to enter the match. It's a solid match that simply needed a better back story than what we got. There was also a solid X Division Title match with Christopher Daniels and Suicide putting together a good match that played off of Daniels's stint as the masked man.

There arw two legitimately great matches on this show; unfortunately, what puts this show down a notch is that most of the story development was time-killer to bridge the gap between more important shows. While the wrestling is good, the stories made it seem like things would've gone better had TNA not felt obligated to fill a PPV slot in their schedule between ""Lockdown"" and ""Slammiversary"".",1411257600,,2087,4.840336134453781

8360963,3,B002BB701S,"Lethal Consequences & Eric Young vs. Motor City Machine Gunz & Sheik Abdul Bashir - This was a great opener that was filled with fast athletics, cool spots, and great double team synchronized moves while still telling the ongoing story regarding Eric Young at that time.  A fun opening match & the right way to kick off a PPV.

Monster's Ball Match: Taylor Wilde vs. Daffney - Eventhought this was the first ever female version of this match, this was easily the weakest Monster's Ball ever as it was really too short & didn't live up the ""hardcore"" standards that this match is known for outside of that one bump Daffney took on the trash can at the end that was really nasty.  Everything afterwards involving Abyss & Dr. Stevie was more interesting here than that the match itself.

X Division Champion Suicide vs. Daniels - Daniels come off like he was wrestling a clone of himself (ironic, isn't it) as this wasn't like the opening match where it was a fast paced ""spotty"" X Division match but the style of being more focused on having a grounded wrestling match.  If you can get past the ending, it was a solid encounter.  I wonder after this match if we'll get a 3 way dance with Curry Man too?

TNA Knockouts Champion Angelina Love vs. Awesome Kong - Love was all alone on this one after Kong took out the Beautiful People & even Cute Kip in stretcher matches after Lockdown.  Based on the buildup to this match, you were expecting Kong to completely kill her but you didn't get that here as Love actually did a good job of selling that she was scared & running away from her like she was being chased by Jason Voorhees at Crystal Lake.  Eventhough I thought the ending was a bit ""eh"", this was one of those matches where the wrestling wasn't much but did tell a nice story for what they did.

Samoa Joe vs. Kevin Nash - This match was just like the earlier match where it wasn't about the wrestling but more about the story that was being told as this wasn't like their really good match at Turning Point but the purpose here was to build up Samoa Joe and this was booked the right way in that respect...and at least this was a match unlike how Destination X was really just a segment.

Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament Finals: Beer Money vs. British Invasion - After watching this, I just have one question to ask...who is that Brutus Magnus imposter?  I'm just joking but for anyone who's seen Brutus performance here & compared it to his previous matches in TNA...it's like they are two completely different people as this was the best he's ever looked.  This was an overall fun & entertaining match that went back & forth between both teams with Various highlights including Beer Money putting their own little twist on the ""skin the cat"" top rope spot along with Team 3D's interaction with Don West on commentary.  Again, a very fun match.

TNA Legends Champion A.J. Styles vs. Booker T - This was very similar to their Destination X in that this was an average match as they did work well together but never seemed to leave ""first gear"" & had the same pace throughout the bout.  The ending however hurt the match more than helped it as it made the whole thing look like this was really nothing more than to continue the storyline between the two M.E.M. women in Sharmell & Jenna.  Solid average match with a hurtful crappy ending.

Ultimate Sacrifice Match: TNA Champion Mick Foley vs. Sting vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Kurt Angle - Now the setup for this is real simple in that whoever is the victor will win whatever the loser sacrificed going into the match...Mick Foley put up his TNA Title, Jeff Jarrett put up his voting shares as TNA founder, Sting put up his career, and Angle put up his leadership role in the Main Event Mafia.  Various highlights include an anklelock/mandible claw submission move at one point, Mick Foley pulling off an act that an ex-tag team partner & ""electrifing"" superstar used to do at the announce table, how Kurt Angle came after Foley at the annouce table, Kurt applying a double ankle lock at one point, and the interaction between Foley/Sting & Angle/Jarrett.  This was your typical multiman ""free for all"" match in TNA where it was non-stop action & fun to watch.

In the end, this was a good PPV from TNA that wasn't on the level of one of their bigger shows (LockDown, Bound For Glory, Slammiversary) but was solid for a ""B show"" & did it's job in building up to next months Slammiversary so this is one I would check out.",1250812800,,4479,4.498150431565968
