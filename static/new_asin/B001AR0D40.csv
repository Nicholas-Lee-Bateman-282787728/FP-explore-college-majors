3465119,5,B001AR0D40,"Classic Media's RODAN/WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS collection will also include an all-new documentary entitled BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE.

Running 68 minutes, BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE goes behind the scenes of a filmmaking style that remains firmly rooted in the past even as special effects leap into the future. From the original GOJIRA (1954) through 50-plus years of sequels, spin-offs and imitations, this original documentary tells the story of the genre's creation and evolution via exclusive interviews with filmmakers, special-effects artists, actors and monster stuntmen.

Featuring Akira Takarada, Hiroshi Koizumi, Yoshio Tsuchiya, Shogo Tomiyama, Haruo Nakajima, Kenpachiro Satsuma, Tsutomu ""Tom"" Kitagawa, Shusuke Kaneko, Teruyoshi Nakano, Akira Tsuburaya, Ryuji Honda, Shinichi Wakasa, Yasuyuki Inoue, Toshiro Aoki, Akinori Takagi, Toshio Miike, Shiro Sano, and narrated by self-proclaimed Godzilla fan Alex Cox (director of REPO MAN, SID & NANCY), the film celebrates the artistry behind the world of Japanese monsters and ponders the future of Godzilla and his city-smashing analog brethren in the digital age.

The website SciFi Japan has an exclusive first look at BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE, packed with photos and information on this great bonus feature for the upcoming Classic Media DVDs.

3465120,5,B001AR0D40,"Rodan's great, but War of the Gargantuas is the treat here.  With all very due respect to the original Godzilla and King Kong, I'm just going to throw out there that there is no better giant monster movie than WOTG.  I've seen it many times since it gave me nightmares the first time I saw it when I was 5 or so, and it's still nearly perfect. At least in the American version, there are almost no slow spots, some genuine terror and horror, and the monsters are onscreen for an amazing amount of time.  Of course there's no putting a movie like this together without some cheeziness, but even that fits perfectly with it being a sixties film.

It's all in there:  an almost funnily disinterested performance by Russ Tamblyn (looking a little unenthused and questioning whether he should have taken this gig) as the lead scientist, his babe-aliciuos assistant Kumi Mizuno, the chick lounge singer crooning, Gargantua vs octopus,  Gargantua vs military (including masers), Gargantua vs Gargantua, Gargantuas vs city, a volcano... it's got it all.  Of course the music is awesome, and I can't believe I'm going to see it in a wider screen view than I ever have.  Can't wait!",1216944000,35,1172,4.71078431372549

Ive been a fan of japanese monster flicks(back in the 60s when i was a kid) a long time. This is one of TOHOs REAL DEAL classic kaiju films!! NO cgi,which has its place too...mmm, maybe a REMAKE!

3465122,5,B001AR0D40,"I cannot believe this is finally here. I have been waitng for both of these for a long time. Rodan(in my oppinion)is one of the best acting and absolutely the best dubbed of the giant monster movies.
 I am looking forward to the Japanese originals of both. It's obvious that a lot of people are also anxious for this.
 All thats left now is Godzilla vs Megalon. Hopefully soon.
 Wonder if other studios are going to follow. I would love to see the Johnny Sokko movie ""Voyage into Space"" in original Japanese.

3465123,5,B001AR0D40,When i saw this on my recommendations list i quickly listed my vhs tape for sale and it sold the next day. I made a profit on it to boot. I cant wait to get it on dvd.

I was checking some other items out but as always when I come here, I will check to see if there is any news on War of the Gargantuas.  I almost died when I saw a release date for it. I can't believe that I will finally be able to see this after basically disappearing from cable tv. For years, as a previoius review listed, it would be on WPIX 11 in New York. I remember thinging at 5 years old (I am 40 today), what the F*** is this. Something about it caught my attention and I always loved the movie, even though I have seen it less than 5 times in my life. You just had to be lucky to catch it. Even years later on TBS you had to be lucky to see it. Anyway, I will freak when I see the package in my mail box and make a huge bag of popcorn and pop the dvd in. Who would of ""thunk it"". War of the Gargantuas is finally coming out on dvd. What's next, a remake of the classic ""King Kong vs. Godzilla.

3465128,5,B001AR0D40,"Following the release of GOJIRA (Godzilla, King of the Monsters, before Raymond Burr was cut in) and it's sequel, Toho made their first color giant monster movie: RODAN(aka Radon, and Rodan ,The Flying Monster).Unlike most creature features of the time RODAN doesn't make you wait 2/3's of the movie for a monster to show up .Meganurons, giant prehistoric dragonfly larva make their appearance rather early in the film. It's this part of the film that's often compared to ""Them"".However,in RODAN the giant insects are only the set up. In the most memorable scene, when the character comes out of shock, he not only remembers being trapped underground with the Meganurons but also the hatching of a Rodan chick from it's egg. Having the audience already in on the size of the larva provides instant scale, as the hatchling devours the Meganurons. To add to the excitement of the rest of the picture we learn that in fact two Rodans have hatched.

The film is played straight, unlike later entries in what's become known as the Godzilla series.

Although Rodan has appeared in other films, Gidorah,the Three Headed Monster,Godzilla vs Monster Zero(Invasion of the Astro Monsters),and Destroy All Monsters, the look of Rodan was never as good as in this, the original.

Now for the first time Classic Media is presenting this film to American audiences in both it's original 82 min  Japanese language version as well the 72 min English  language  version.

THE WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS  makes it's DVD debut. It's also presented in both the Japanese Version (88 mins.), and  English Version (92 mins.).

Special Features: ""Bringing Godzilla Down To Size"" a new Documentary (68 mins.)

If the quality of the re-mastering and source material remains the same, as it's been, since  their  Gojira release, in 2006, this should be the best video release of RODAN ever.",1213660800,99,1857,4.970873786407767

I was a big fan of the Japanese giant Monster movies as a kid!  They were like Monster All Star Wrestling matches  l.o.l.!!!  Now at age 50 I am appreciating the art of the Japanese style special effects.  The Japanese & Chinese have a style of their own in movie making whether your watching the old classics on Kung-Fu Theater or the Giant Monster movies...they have a pride & style that is so unique to their culture that it is very admirable!!!  This is also reflected in their stunt men & what they go through to make a film!  These old monster films may not have mass appeal but for those who found them endearing as a kid its certainly worth the price to revisit your youth with older eye's & appreciate these old classics on a whole new level!",1465257600,,914,4.431137724550898

3465166,5,B001AR0D40,"A mystery of sorts, who killed miner Yoshi?  At first the blame is placed on another miner, missing in the mine.  But when three more men die in much the same manner, concern shifts.  What or who could possibly be murdering people and why.  Then a giant dragonfly larvae (Meganulon) shows up in the village, hungry.  Mass hysteria and angry men with guns soon sends the poor larvae fleeing for its life........back into the mine.  When a UFO shows up, people wonder if theres a connection.
This, is the auspicious entrance of Rodan into film history.  This was before that big bully Godzilla began to take his frustrations out on the poor misunderstood birdie (of a sort).  Sadly, this was the only time he was the star of a movie.  Later, Rodan became just a bit player.

The second feature is War of the Gargantuas, the sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World.  This movie features two giants, quasi-brothers, clones of a sort.  One is an insatiable people eater; the other is a friendly guy who is never shown eating anything or anyone.  Naturally, people take exception to these giants roaming around, especially the one who cant stop popping people into his gaping maw.  So they shoot at them and try to fricassee them with electrics.  Its very flashy and fun, sparks fly but no one fries.",1463702400,,1296,4.672566371681416

3465169,5,B001AR0D40,"Clearly an excellent deal if at all interested in these two well-liked classic monster flicks. Rodan has long been a favorite, and even more so after having revisited it. While later variants of Rodan were tied to Godzilla films and generally ranged widely in degrees of (entertaining) silliness, the original was a serious, relatively well-crafted drama.

War of the Gargantuas is one of the better classic monster movies in terms of monster action. There is a lot of it and it comes off more believably than many others. You might think that being simply humanoid monsters that the suit actors would look like the humans they are, rampaging around scale cities. But the end result is quite the opposite. Russ Tamblyn is a part of the overall cast to some entertaining effect along with Kumi Mizuno,  though there isn't the same chemistry that Nick Adams famously shared with her in Monster Zero.

Each movie gets a dvd to itself and with both the English and Japanese language variants. It is very easy to recommend this dvd offering.",1462233600,3,1036,4.84180790960452

There were scan lines in the movie from bad dvd ripping and it was an obvious bootleg.
The copy I bought used here myself, was pristine, had both discs and was an original official Classic media release.

RODAN:  Sound and picture are excellent.  Next to the original 1954 ""Godzilla,"" this is the most serious Japanese monster movie by Toho.  Really holds up well, with excellent script, music and effects.  This 2-DVD set includes the original Japanese version of ""Rodan"" as well as the American version and it's fascinating to compare them.  Sound and picture are even better on Japanese version and you'll be amazed at how much really cool footage was cut out of the American version - important story information and terrific monster scenes.  The story really makes so much more sense when you see the Japanese version, with all the footage restored.  Fantastic!

WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS:  Right up there with the original ""Godzilla"" and ""Rodan"" as far as the high quality and serious nature of the script.  No wacky comedy (i.e., Godzilla jumping up and down or sailing along on his tail) in this film.  It's played dead straight throughout and that makes it very strong.  The miniatures and effects are fantastic and Toho's original monsters are gruesome and at the same time, human.  Great atmosphere and even Russ Tamblyn, miscast as a doctor, doesn't spoil the fun.

3465278,4,B001AR0D40,"First Review: RODAN. (English dubbed version)

PICTURE: It's in it's correct full frame size as the original was filmed 1.33:1.  It's the first Toho monster movie in COLOR. So a plus there. The quality is maybe just a tad better than VHS. This is a negative.  Blurry and grainy for the most part, dark in many parts but this in a way kind of helps the overall mood/effect. Colors are not very bright. I understand it's very old. Regardless of picture flaws, no real complaints.

AUDIO:  This is where I had some issues. The sound fluctuates, at least for me. The loud parts are too loud and the quiet parts are too quiet.  I had to constantly adjust the volume throughout the whole flick as to not disturb my neighbors. ( I live in an apt.).

OVERALL MOVIE EXPERIENCE:  I had not seen this movie in maybe 40 years since when I was a kid, so although I always knew who Rodan was in the Godzilla franchise, I did not remember this original Rodan movie.  I can say now, this is one of the better ones with a decent plot and story. This is of course before things got really silly and comical for Toho. 3 stars.

Second Review: BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE> An hour long documentary of the history of Toho/Godzilla franchise:

PICTURE and SOUND: Modern. Will fill your screen (at least for my PC as of 2014 and I have a 23"" Samsung) For the $7.00 I paid for this entire set of 2 disks and 2 movies (both can be viewed in English dubbed or original Japanese with English subtitles...so in effect 4 movies) As far as this lone special feature...WOW!!!  This documentary is on disk one which you can watch anytime of course or before or after RODAN. It is well worth the $7.00 price of the entire Keepcase set all by itself alone! I won't go into too much detail to spoil it for you but it covers everything. I have never seen a docu on this subject like this. EXCELLENT. In Japanese with subtitles but has and English narrator. You even get to meet the 3 guys who acted in the Godzilla suits! A. 5 STARS!

Third Review (second disc) WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS (English dubbed version):

PICTURE: It's in it's original 2.35:1 Widescreen. My preference is for all movies to be in this format. This is about as good as you can expect, even by today's standards.

AUDIO:  The sound, again, like RODAN, you may need to adjust due to the loud parts being too loud and the quiet parts too quiet. I love the soundtrack, but something seems different. Maybe someone who knows this film better than I can explain what may have changed from when I was 10 years old. Still great however.

OVERALL MOVIE EXPERIENCE: Well, I will be honest, I bought this DVD through Amazon for this movie alone. Sometimes, I like an escapism, going back to when I was a little kid. For fun, you know. I always felt this was one of, if not the best, of the Toho giant monster movies. Sure, like most kids, Godzilla is king, but this movie has a much more human element to the monsters. My grade Is ""A"" or 4.5 stars.

IMPORTANT FINAL NOTES:  Although I bought this movie through Amazon, I had to click the button that says ""Available through these sellers"" meaning Amazon itself did not have it in stock. So I had to purchase it through a third party. I sent my order through and payed extra for 2 day shipping along with some other flicks in the package. The other movies arrived within two days, but War of the Gargantuas took at least two weeks to receive. Sometimes a find to hard flick like WOTG is something we all need to be patient for.  The fact that I spent all this time on reviewing this DVD says it's worth the $7 I paid. A great gift for your 10 or so year old son! OH but be careful about letting your young kid watch the documentary at such a young age. It's the Santa Claus effect, let their imagination run wild as if these creatures are real. The docu is for when they are old enough and really ""get it"" that it's guys in costume and just a movie!  Have fun!",1398816000,,3936,4.320652173913044
3465279,4,B001AR0D40,This is a great double disk. It reminds me of the matinee Saturdays I spent at the RKO theater watching monster destroy Japan. Rodan suspense really builds up to when they show up. A all time favorite of mine.,1397606400,,209,4.384615384615385

3465285,5,B001AR0D40,the road and war of the Gargantuas double feature is a great buy for kaiju movie fans it contains both the English and original Japanese version of the films Rodan I am specially recommend the Japanese version because it tastes better and has a creepy ringtone to let as well as no narrator explaining the obvious and to someone who's new to this genre or not too familiar with the War of the Gargantuas if you watch the Japanese version it will mention Frankenstein a bit that is because War of the Gargantuas is a sequel to Toho films Frankenstein conquers the world the Gargantuas were spawn from the cells of Frankenstein if you're a fan of the genre this double feature is a very strong addition to any collection,1394236800,,718,4.530769230769231

3465289,3,B001AR0D40,"If, like me, you ordered this two-pack expecting to receive the lovely, high-quality packaging that has characterized the Toho Master Collection, you will be disappointed.

Like many DVDs and sets in the Master Collection, the War of the Gargantuas/Rodan two-pack has been repackaged. Initially, it was released in ""book-like"" package, similar to the Master Collection releases of Godzilla, Mothra and other classics, with that great poster art printed right on the box.

But if you order this set now, what you're likely to get is a standard-issue keepcase, with the cover art on the usual paper sleeve, completely identical to 95% of the DVDs on your shelf. For me, this is a HUGE letdown, as I was looking forward to displaying the set proudly, being a great fan of nicely designed DVDs, or ""Shelf Candy"".

If you're solely interested in the films, absolutely buy this set, as they're classics of the genre. But if the deciding factor for you was the assumption you'd also be getting a classy, high quality case to occupy a spot of honor on your DVD shelf, bear in mind you're more likely to get a bog-standard keepcase release.",1390435200,6,1131,4.849740932642487

For one is the explanation of what the insect creatures are. Also the back ground over Goro's fight and the reason some of the villagers believe he is a murder. A whole scenario along with others cut by the English language version along with the addition of Atom Bombs scenes at the beginning.

Showing a bigger difference between the English cut and the Japanese original is ""War of the Gargantuas"". Warning: the subtitles are not the correct translation of the Japanese script and there are references at times to Gargantuas which were never there and somehow for a film made in the 1960's Global Warming.

The original title of the film, which also is not used for the Japanese translation, was ""Frankenstein's Monster's"" Sanda vs Gaira"". This film In its Japanese version is a direct sequel to ""Frankenstein vs Baragon"" aka: ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"". The two kaiju Sanda and Gaira are suppose to be the results of the cells taken from the severed hand of the Frankenstein boy. References to their relationship are in the English subtitles, but the direct tie to the hand is missing. Another example as with the same company's translation of ""Radan"" were errors are made.

I think the only disappointment is that ""War of the Gargantuas"" really should have been paired with ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"" since it IS technically a sequel!  (But Frankie & Baragon were released through Tokyo Shock I believe, who also did an excellent job of releasing that film, which I also equally highly recommend!)

For those who aren't familiar with giant monster films or aren't die hard fans like myself, daikaiju is the Japanese term for giant monster.

WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS (1966)

Story: Japanese version: The cells that broke away from the Frankenstein monster in Frankenstein Conquers the World/Frankenstein vs Baragon (1965) have mutated into giant Bigfoot-like behemoths. Sanda (the brown Gargantua) is peaceful, loving, and kind. Gaira (G-eye-rah) (the green Gargantua)is mean, viscous, cruel, and violent basically a John McCain monster just kidding. Sanda discovers that Gaira has been killing and consuming people, so a big battle is under way. My 3 favorite scenes are #3: Sanda beats Gaira with a tree. #2: Gaira vs Odako a giant octopus. #1: Sanda & Gaira's final fight.

The Good: Great score, acting is good except for that singing bitch who has words stuck in her throat and Russ Tamblyn who is talented but acted like a dick while filming and hardly put forth any effort. Great writing, great effects, great story, good dialogue, great pacing, and great film.

The Bad: An annoying singer who thankfully gets eaten by Gaira, which is the only non-evil thing Gaira ever does. Russ Tamblyn puts forth no effort. The print quality is very dark which is not understandable since all other Japanese prints had good quality.

Original Japanese version: 4.8/5 stars

English dubbed version: Sanda and Gaira are just two Bigfoot-like monsters that are brothers who hate each other for the reasons stated above. In this version all references to Frankenstein are cut from the film.

The Good: Everything good mentioned above. The print quality is great.

The Bad: Most of Ifukube's original score is replaced. Erased elements of original story. Russ Tamblyn still acts like a prick who gave no effort and that annoying singer is still there.

English Dubbed version: 3/5 stars

Disc comes with no extra features. WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS disc gets 5/5 stars.

Fun Facts: The original ending of the film was to not only have Sanda and Gaira swallowed up by the new volcano, but the lava was to have spread to Tokyo where it was to destroy the city as well as the remaining cells of the monsters. US producer Henry G. Saperstein had planned to make a sequel where either Sanda, Gaira or a similar, new creature were pitted against Godzilla. It was called Godzilla vs. the Gargantuas but the project was never set in motion. In Crank 2 (2009) there is a fight scene which is an homage to the final battle scene in The War of the Gargantuas--it takes place in a transformer plant and utilizes many of the cinematic cues from the Gargantuas film. The Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated episode ""Battle of the Humungonauts"" is a parody/homage to this film, going so far as to reference the song ""Feel in My Heart (The Words Get Stuck in my Throat)"" which appeared in the film. Actor Brad Pitt cited the movie as his inspiration to go into acting at the 84th Academy Awards.

RODAN (1956)

Story: Japanese version: Two prehistoric eggs hatch revealing 2 Rodans. The Rodans feed off of giant insects called Meganula and soon feed upon humans. The eggs were discovered in a mine as well as the big bugs.

The Good: Great score, great effects, great characters, great story, great acting, great dialogue, and over all great film. Print quality looks great.

Original Japanese version: 5/5 stars

English dubbed version: Same story but dubbed in English with cut and added scenes.

The Good: Same from Japanese version. Print quality is okay.

The Bad: Cuts scenes, added in cliched scenes, and most of the score is  missing.

English dubbed version: 3/5 stars

Disc contains new documentary entitled bring Godzilla down to size. Rodan disc gets 5/5 stars.

Fun Facts: Veteran writer Ken Kuronuma, who wrote the original story for this film, was inspired by an incident in Kentucky in 1948, when Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a pilot for the Kentucky Air National Guard, died in a crash while allegedly pursuing a UFO.
While shooting the scene in which Rodan flies over the bridge in Saikai Village in Kyushu, the pulley from which Haruo Nakajima was suspended broke. He fell from a height of twenty-five feet, but the wings and the water, which was about one and a half feet deep, absorbed much of the impact. The giant insects featured in this film, the Meganula, would later go on to appear in the 2000 film Godzilla vs. Megaguirus. In It by Stephen King, the boy Mike is haunted by the image of Rodan. Mike sees a giant bird (the clown Pennywise) in the ruins of a steel mill and thinks of Rodan. This was the first Toho monster movie shot in color.

Note: When I saw Rodan at the age of 6 the ending made me cry.

3465307,5,B001AR0D40,"*May contain spoilers*

War of the Gargantuas is the story of two gigantic ape-like monsters, a malevolent ""green"" one that resides in the ocean and eats humans ( attacking ships at first, .. . then emerging on land to seek his prey and slake his appetite ) and a benevolent, however reclusive, ""brown"" one who dwells in the mountains, who's disparate natures clash resulting in a raging brawl to the death.

In the prolific and well-known genre of jap monster flicks, THIS is absolutely one of the BETTER ones, .. . probably even the 2nd BEST, at that, next to the very first Godzilla movie ( King of the Monsters 1956 )!

Firstly, THIS is one of the very few old jap monster flicks that I actually find SCARY. This flick really does have some genuinely frightening and nightmarish scenes which positively horrified me as a kid ( when I first saw this 1966 movie ) and still creep me out a bit even today, . .. like particularly where two guys look down over the edge of a boat they're on and see the evil green monsters hideous visage just below the waters transparent surface looking up at them hungrily, THAT's truly classic! . .. Or a scene in which he actually EATS a woman ( places her in his mouth and chews ) on camera!  Or another scene, taking place in the ocean, where he chases some terrified swimmers, who're fleeing desperately ( and ultimately vainly )from the pursuing horror. Or another set on a luxury cruise ship with a band playing a song and a beautiful woman singing to a relaxed audience in what starts out as a really calm and sedate scene, .. . then the hideous monster just enters out of nowhere and totally unexpectedly ( really catches you off guard ), and next thing you know this big ugly slavering ogre has this gal in his hand and is fixing to devour her! This monster also makes a really terrifying godawful sound , .. . ""CCHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!"".

Another thing about the monsters in THIS flick is that they're more humanoid in appearance, as opposed to being some guy in a big lizard costume or something like that, which I find also makes them seem less fake corny and ridiculous and more realistic and believable than in allot of these other old jap monster films.

Something else about this one, there's more dramatic substance to these fighting monsters. In all these other monster ""Vrs"" monster flicks the monsters just fight without any discernible motive. But THESE ones actually have a clear dramatic motive. At first the good ""brown"" one tries to help the evil green one and give him refuge, thinking he's just being persecuted by humans ( he saves him while he's being attacked with tanks, bombs, a laser cannon, and jolted in an electrified lake ), but then discovers the reason the humans are trying to destroy him ( cause he's been eating them ) and THAT is when the titular ""War"" ensues. There's even a scene in which the good ""brown"" one attempts to persuade the evil one to stop and turn from his evil( conveyed in their movements gestures and facial expressions ) before they engage in a violent brawl together. Another thing that sets this film apart is that the creatures seem to actually be hurt by the weapons as opposed to the seemingly invincible and oblivious nature of Godzilla and crew.

The musical score is also good, .. particularly what seems to be the evil green monsters theme and the suitably terrifying and dramatic piece played during the title & opening credits sequence, over a visual depiction of a raging ocean.

A truly superb and exceptional monster mash and crucially recommended to monster buffs, .. . or buffs of horror / fantasy cinema in general!",1368835200,,3639,4.631007751937984

To have both these great movies on DVD is a dream come true to any Toho monster fan as these two represent the apex of the three original creators of Godzilla: movie director Ishiro Honda, special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya and music composer Akira Ifukube.

The first Toho monster movie shot in color, Rodan (1956) is one of the most beloved films from Toho's golden age of Japanese science-fiction cinema. A coalition of miners discover abnormal flooding within the mine when they are suddenly attacked by a man-eating dragonfly nymph called Meganulon. After pursuing the bug back to its resting place, a cave-in traps one of the miners (Kenji Sahara), who makes a more horrific discovery: Rodan, the flying monster. Then it gets worse: instead of one Rodan, there are two!

Rodan was co-written by Takeo Murata (Godzilla) and Takeshi Kimura, who would go on to be one of Toho's main monster scribes (the other being Shinichi Sekizawa), writing scripts for The Mysterians (1957), H-Man (1958), Gorath (1962) and Matango (1963). Besides being a marvelous monster movie, Rodan is also an excellent thriller with a horror undertone, relentless suspense and one of Akira Ifukube's most haunting scores. While the special effects have dated somewhat (you can see strings in several shots), the movie is so well-made and exciting that it actually makes these dated effects more endearing than distracting. Also, the way the movie transits from a horror film to a fast-paced action movie when Rodan first appears is so seamless that one doesn't notice the change until repeated viewings. All this is in the Japanese cut only, however. In the American version, the King Brothers trimmed down and arranged scenes, added an unnecessary prologue and voiceover narration and replaced some of Ifukube's music with the same stock footage used in the US version of Godzilla Raids Again, turning Rodan into a standard B-monster movie. While nowhere near as laughably bad as Gigantis, these changes can sometimes be a nuisance. For example, the battle between Rodan and the Japanese air defense force uses some of the same footage twice or even three times to accelerate the pacing. While it helps make the action more exciting, the reuse of the same footage also makes the movie feel cheaper than it is. Similarly, the ending of the Japanese cut of Rodan ended with Ifukube's melancholic music played in the forefront; in the American version, voiceover narration is inexplicably used, which defuses the sadness completely.

War of the Gargantuas (1966) is one of the last great Toho monster movies before the Japanese film industry went down the toilet, resulting in severe budget cuts, mass layoffs, dwindling film quality and obvious use of stock footage (including, ironically enough, footage from this movie). Although the movie is loosely connected to another Toho monster movie, Frankenstein vs. Baragon (1965), Gargantuas can be enjoyed even if you've never heard of Frankenstein or Baragon. A giant green humanoid terrorizes the Japanese coast, eventually defeated by Japan's space-ray laser cannons. However, the green Gargantua is rescued by his brown brother and they escape. Named Gaira and Sanda respectively, the green and brown gargantuas don't see eye to eye and it all leads to a monstrous showdown in the streets of Tokyo.

Although War of the Gargantuas is often viewed as a spiritual successor to Frankenstein vs. Baragon, the only connection it really has with the previous movie is that the word ""Frankenstein"" is used and that the three main characters have the same names, despite being played by different actors (only Kumi Mizuno returns). That being said, as judged by its own entity, War of the Gargantuas is a gargantuan knockout (sorry for the lame pun). Gargantuas is not as complex as Godzilla and The Mysterians, as haunting as Rodan and Matango or as captivating as Mothra and Atragon. But what it lacks in those aspects, it makes up in pure non-stop action. The movie starts and never slows down the pace, with Gaira assaulting an airport and Operation L sequences being standouts. It also has a very poignant scene involving the two gargantuas: Sanda discovers Gaira resting when he sees human clothes, revealing that Gaira ate the humans. In a fury, Sanda rips out a tree and bashes Gaira with it. Without the use of dialogue, Honda and Tsuburaya successfully depicts two monsters on opposite sides of the coin: the violent, sadistic Gaira and the kind, benevolent Sanda who only attacks when provoked. But no Toho monster movie would be complete without a monster brawl and the battle between Gaira and Sanda is one for the ages. In fact, one would say that this was the battle King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) should have had instead of the comical wrestling match at Mt. Fuji. Added note: I didn't watch the American version yet, so I cannot give an honest review on that.

Rodan and War of the Gargantuas are great movies but the DVD itself is far from great. Although it's nice to have both the JP and US versions on DVD, the set sadly lacks audio commentaries, trailers and featurettes. Well, sort of. On the Rodan disc, there is an excellent one-hour documentary called Bringing Godzilla Down to Size, which compensates the severe lack of bonus features by depicting the rise and fall and renaissance of Godzilla and Toho monster movies from the golden age to the dark 70's to Godzilla's rebirth in the 90's to his hiatus in 2004 with the horrendous Final Wars (see my review). Not coincidentally, this documentary was made by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, who also provided excellent commentaries on Godzilla, Godzilla Raids Again and Mothra vs. Godzilla. It's just too bad Classic Media wouldn't allow them to provide one for either Rodan or Gargantuas.

DVD flaws aside, Rodan and War of the Gargantuas are welcome additions to any Toho monster fan's collection. The blend of excellent screenwriting, good acting, enjoyable special effects and, of course, the monsters themselves illustrates why Toho monster movies were a breed apart from the dull, pedestrian monster-on-the-loose movies that were extremely prevalent in the United States at the time. Get it while you still can.

3465339,5,B001AR0D40,"According to comments he made that aired on television for the 84th (?) Academy Awards on Sunday, 2/26/12, it was the first movie that he remembered seeing and he recalled it with fondness sharing his memories of the bad, green gargantua and how the good gargantua sacrificed itself to defeat the bad one.  Finally WOTG gets the recognition that it has long deserved!  Will Pitt entertain an American remake of the film?  Not event a remote chance of that of course.  (Though maybe someone should mail a copy to Pitt?)  Great to hear it referenced in contemporary (highbrow even) media as it's almost 50 years old!

Thanks to Classic Media for putting this out on DVD for the American audience for the first time.  I don't care which print was used it is simply nice to have a DVD copy when none had previously existed (Region 1 that is).  One of my favorite kaiju movies of all time (if not my favorite) this highly entertaining movie approaches what are essentially overgrown abominable snowmen (sure, the green one lives in the ocean and looks a bit like he's covered in seaweed and kelp) as both sympathetic (even the nasty green one, when he is being electrified into bloody stains by the military, comes off as sympathetic in that moment) and monstrous.  There are many outstanding moments in this movie: when the fisherman looks down from his boat into the water and the green gargantua is looking up from just underneath; when the ""devilfish"" (octopus) attacks the fishing vessel in the storm and those individual tentacles act as if they each have their own brain and set of eyes; when the brown gargantua sees the spat out chewed human remains and turns on his green ""brother"" by bashing him with an uprooted tree; when the green gargantua breaks his leg when boulders crush into it even as he saves the story's ""Fay Wray"" character.  Wonderful moments, great effects and settings (both in the city, the mountains, and the sea), and plenty of screentime devoted to the monsters makes this a standout in the kaiju genre.

Also on this bill of sale is yet another copy of the underrated Rodan.  This movie, with its great introductory voice-over, tells us the mysterious and disturbing tale of people disappearing and turning up dead in an isolated mining village up in the mountains.  The tension mounts as the police and the miners venture into the flooded mines only to come face-to-face with the creatures causing the horrors (small bus-sized insectoid creatures with enourmous pincers and a taste for human flesh).  But this is only the set-up for the discovery of something even more menacing and gigantic is just around the corner: a prehistoric pteranodon-ish bird-monster that pecks at the insectoids much like they were mealworms.  The movie moves along briskly with lots of footage of the monsters (oops! there's not just one rodan, there's two!) and some sometimes spectacular special effects and sometimes painful effects.  Rodan often looks excellent here, usually far better than it does when it appears in other later Godzilla movies.  Again, these monsters are portrayed both as monstrous (their sheer destructive capabilities) and sympathetically (where they literally go down in flames with the one apparent mate refusing to abandon the other).  This has been available in many formats, including DVD, for quite a while.  It's nice that we have it here and Classic Media does us one better by providing us with the original Japanese language version.  I found the transfer to be fine.

Rodan, while perhaps billed as the ""first"" feature here, is not the main draw.  But getting it along with WOTG is just icing on the cake.  And the price doesn't hurt either.",1330214400,2,3686,4.871794871794871
3465340,5,B001AR0D40,"Rodan followed Godzilla onto the screen as Japanese expanded the genre that would allow Toho to dominate a portion of the 25% of the Japanese film industry billed as children's films in the 1960's while industry reeled from television's competition (the other 75% were so-called pink films, e.g., light porn and erotic thrillers).  War of the Gargantuas is a later, lesser effort, a pair of giant Frakenstein monsters as a variation on the giant monster theme.  (The Frankenstein link is deemphasized in the English dubbed version but more apparent in  the original Japanese.)  The two Frankenstein monsters battle across the landscape - good twin, evil twin.

3465363,4,B001AR0D40,"I finally bought the collector's edition of ""Rodan"" and ""War of the Gargantuans"". Thanks, Classic Media. Damn, what a good way to waste $25 bucks but the movies are so good it was totally worth it. The DVD is of good quality, although lacking the usual special features I was expecting. I was really hoping to hear the G-experts view on the two films but there is a nice hour-long documentary included. ""Bringing Godzilla down to size"" tells the complex story of Godzilla's rise to fame and tragic fall, yet soon return. Anyways, I'll start with ""Rodan"", my personal favorite of the two. I originally saw it on AMC back in like middle school but didn't get the whole experience till I watched the Japanese version. The annoying narration and removal of Ifukbe's score really take away from the American version, know what I mean? This movie was Toho's first in-color flick and this film really sets the bar, among the best monster movies. The score by Akira Ifukube is one of his best, being incredibly dark and moving, especially when the two Rodans met their untimely end. Rodan has never been better portrayed here than in any other movie he stars in, the only one even coming close being ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla II"". One really cares for them as they are engulfed in the hell of Mt. Aso, that as mentioned earlier is one of the rare moments I'm brung nearly to tears. And Rodan just looks terrific, no lie. His eyes are powerful, his movements graceful. The story and human characters are very well put together and we actually care. The tone is dark and serious thanks to Honda, God bless his soul. The rampage on Saseba was bad-ass, my favorite part though being when Rodan is attacked by the air force. All this is accomplished via Tsubaraya's excellent work, incredible for the time. This film ranks up there with ""Gojira""

War of the Gargantuans"", another Honda-flick, is a real treat, the unofficial sequel to ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"". With practically the same production team, the film is pretty damn good. Odako ( the giant octopus) is great in this movie. The last time I saw him was what, 62', back in ""King Kong vs. Godzilla""? Sanda and Gailah are a nice break from the onslaught of reptilian and insect monsters, both looking nice and thankfully realistic. The ""brother's"" conflict is an interesting part of the story, and, like ""Rodan"", the human carnage really gives a more adult feeling while watching. We see some great action sequences, this movie starring the Maser tank, which will star in the exact same scene in ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" thanks to horrendous stock-footage. Because of their ""human"" appearance and characteristics, the gargantuans can interact with the protagonist in a way a giant dinosaur, three-headed dragon, or giant moth just can't. This film is also one of the few to star an American actor, who fits in nicely. The music is dope, Ifukube delivering a nice and dark score. He even includes a spunky JSDF march, as he did in many of Honda's ""Golden Age"" movies, a nice edition. To be clear this American version was better than ""Rodan""'s, but once again the score is heavily edited, not even including the JSDF theme at all! Either way, that annoying song at the nightclub is included, but seeing as Gailah kills the braud I'll let it go. As I watched it, one can't help but feel such disappointment with Godzilla. After ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"", the series went to total crap thanks to Jun Fukuda and the crappy scores. 1967, ""War of the Gargantuans"" was released, compared to ""Son of Godzilla"". Damn...... If Toho had simply let Honda continue doing the films without the sacrifice of the serious tone for a childish one that soon became played out; maybe Godzilla would've never even had to cut his Showa era short. Just a thought that was on my mind. Back to the 2-disc set, damn, good work Classic Media.",1290470400,2,3870,4.75037147102526

RODAN (RADON in Japan) was Ishiro Honda's first major monster feature following the success of GODZILLA. It exhibits many of the signature trademarks which he stamped on each of his films, including a supreme attention to human interest, impotent leading characters, and a helpless military force that is at the mercy of the attacking monster. Honda also treats the Rodans as natural animal characters that find themselves thrust in to a world that is foreign to them. Honda is reunited with many of the skilled team members from GODZILLA, including more of the studio's finest special effects work designed by Eiji Tsuburaya and a powerful and expressive score provided by Akira Ifukube. In addition to more incredible miniature cityscapes being razed by the Radons' supersonic waves, Tsuburaya also introduces a series of aerial dogfights between the Japanese fighters and the flying menaces that equally impressive. RODAN briefly touches on the same atomic fears as GODZILLA had, but they do not become the same driving theme of the picture. Honda and Toho studios strike another great success with this memorable addition to their monster line-up, and Rodan would appear in numerous crossovers in to the GODZILLA franchise in the decades following.

Thinking these old movies from the 50s and 60s would be a great alternative to current PG-13 movies (""but my friends watched it"") that I feel my sons are too young to see, I threw ""Rodan"" on amid protests.  The silence was immediate as the movie started.  Both my boys were spellbound by these movies although the second one, Gargantuas, was the favorite.

I hadn't seen it in years, but I happended to stumble onto it at a store.  It was really cool not only to see the dubbed version, but to see the original Japanese version as well.  I never knew that War was a sequel to Frankenstein Conquers The World or that the Garagntuas had names (Green Gargantua is Gaira, Brown Gargantua is Sanda).  I had always kind of thought that the Gargantuas were Toho's spin on the Yeti legend.

Anyway, if you love these kind of movies, War is the best.  The tight costumes that the actors who portrayed Gaira and Sanda wore allowed them freedom of movement that you just don't see in the Godzilla movies.  The fact that the eyes were cut out of the masks so that you can see the actor's eye movements gives the Gargantuas a really creepy feeling.

Gaira is awesome.  He's mobile, agile and hostile!  The laser attack on him was really well choreographed.  Gaira's fight with the giant octopus and his sinking of an unfortunate fishing boat at the movie's start really got the ball rolling early.  His preferred choices of snacks can give you a genuine chill that Godzilla doesn't.  Plus, I really love his roar.  Do any of you know how the filmmakers created Gaira's roar?

Now with this dvd any aficionado of the movie can watch the Japanese widescreen version in the original Japanese language with English subtitles.

Why package the horribly boring Rodan (that about sums up as much as I'll say about Rodan in this review) with War of the Gargantuas instead of bundling War of the Gargantuas with its true sister film titled ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"".

The real gem in this release is War of the Gargantuas. I can hear the voiceover for the trailer of Gargantuas: ""From the director that brought you the original 1954 GODZILLA, 1962's KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA, and 1968's DESTROY ALL MONSTERS comes...FURANKENSHUTAIN!

Franken - what!?

Remember, I'm not talking about Rodan and War of the Gargantuas; I'm talking about ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"" (1965) and ""War of the Gargantuas"" (1966). In Japan they had that kooky Furankenshutain name...roughly translated to Frankenstein. Sadly, Director Ishiro Honda died in 1993 so we won't be able to ask him how (or if) he ever got rights to use the Frankenstein franchise name for a series of two movies that don't really look or feel anything like the Frankenstein that we over here in the US know and love.

The only resemblance to Frankenstein in Honda's ""Furankenshutain"" movies is that the Gargantuas are indeed fuh-uh-uhg-ly, but they look much more like the King Kong that Honda created for the 1962 battle against Godzilla and later in 1967 for King Kong Escapes.

I remember vividly from my last viewing of War of the Gargantuas in my pre-teen years that it was a shocking G-rated film. There was a good Gargantua (the brown one) and a bad one (the green one...the fugliest of them all). And they were Godzilla-sized...not Frankenstein-sized. The green Gargantua bloodily, bone-crunchingly munches on people whole and spits out their bloody clothes. I'd like to see THAT try to get a G-rating today.

In War of the Gargantuas everyone thinks that there's only one murderous Gargantua. Until the brown one shows up at the scene of a crime and tries to stop the green one. The green one wants blood and refuses to live and let live, and the two Gargantuas fiercely battle through the rest of the movie.

Devo must have been a fan of this flick, because they did a remake of a featured song in War of the Gargantuas called ""The Words Get Stuck in My Throat."" At least I think that Devo's version was a tribute to the movie? Too bad a Gargantua didn't eat Devo back in the 70s.

Anyway, I'm sure that my subconscious, pre-teen mind is telling me that this flick is better (and more shocking) than it really was. But I'm glad to see that Gargantuas was finally released. Check out War of the Gargantuas (4 stars). Skip Rodan (2 stars).",1247875200,2,2624,4.726477024070022

This is a wonderful package, the kind many of us have learned to expect from Classic Media, including the attractive paperboard case for this two disc set. You are really getting 4 films, not counting the featurette on special effects. You get the two versions of each primary film, Rodan in English (with an annoying narrator who I thought unnecessary and irritating) and Japanese  with subtitles (and without the added-for-American-audiences narrator), and the same treatment for War of the Gargantuas. As another reviewer commented, Rodan, the giant pterodactyl, never looked better than in this first appearance, who would be teamed up with Godzilla in later films. The second disk contains the venerable slugfest, War of the Gargantuas, both in its English version (where we hear a rather subdued Russ Tamblyn deliver lines in his own voice, sounding a little wry, particularly when he offers a sarcastic line) and again the Japanese version, longer and more explanatory in relating the film as a sort of sequel to the earlier Frankenstein Conquers the World.
So there you have it, two complete versions of each primary film in DVD and a special featurette in an attractive case. What could be reasonably better?",1233273600,5,1336,5.100456621004566
3465376,5,B001AR0D40,"Rodan was awesome...and just watched War of the Gargantuas for the first time since I was a kid sleeping over at my cousin's house when I was 10 years old. This movie awakened great memories for me. In fact we would go out play War of the Gargantuas in the backyard many times after we saw this movie as kids. While I didn't go out and turn cars over and knock down buildings after my most recent viewing, the film was as great as ever.
I watched the film on a portable dvd player and the transfer by Classic Media was super with brilliant color and great film making. The classic ending and long duel between the brown and green Gargantua was a great ending that really didn't end after all. The Brown giant takes a royal beating in this film but the green giant gets his due from the Japanese military in the form of some electrifying moments..heh heh...
Enjoy this Toho classic from the 60's!!! It's a great add to your collection of classic monster films. I watched the Japanese version of the movie and enjoyed every second. The subtitles do not take away from Ichiro Honda's greatness!!!!!",1232841600,,1095,4.48
3465377,5,B001AR0D40,"This is a great double DVD set with both Rodan & War of the Gargantuas..
First about War - is a sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World. I have watched this movie for over 30 years. This one has Russ Tamblyn & famous Godzilla actors Kenji Sahara,Jun Tazaki,Kumi Mizuno (they are in quite a few Godzilla movies)The Brown Gargantua vs the Green Gargantua (Green is the evil one) Yes they are men in monster suits but the effects,models are all really good,the movie is fast paced,entertaining,good music score. These movies made lots of money in the Tokyo box office. Thoroughly enjoyable - I would recommend this to anyone curious about giant monster movies that like Godzilla, this is made by and acted by the same crew.
Rodan (aka Radon in Japan)- 2 flying giant monsters terrorize Japan in the first Kaiju movie in color. The effects were decent (too many strings in some scenes) - it starts out with big bugs eating miners, who discover an egg and out comes Rodan who eats the bugs (they are tiny to Rodan) soon the 2 Rodans are flying everywhere.
These 2 movies have something in common - a volcano does them all in...
The DVD from classic media - if you are someone who likes English dubbed language - then it is as good as it will get on DVD, clean widescreen transfer on War. Rodan got lesser treatment as it is the same old VHS print used. English subtitles as well for those who want to see it for the original Japanese version. My DVD worked fine with subs. I think this is a must and great treat for fans of giant monster movies. Worth the price just for War alone ! :)",1232582400,4,1582,4.421232876712328

3465393,5,B001AR0D40,"Classic Media has once again put out an amazing product with its two disc set of Rodan and War of the Gargantuas. This is the first time I have been able to see the Japanese versions of these films and what a difference it makes. The pointless and schmaltzy voice over narration from the dubbed American version of Rodan is mercifully absent from the original version, both of which are presented here. The picture from the Japanese version looks clean, with great colors and is presented in its original full screen ratio. The transfer is so clean in fact that you can actually see the strings on Rodan in a couple sequences. I was also surprised to hear the scientists discussing global warming in a kaiju film, and one that is over 50 years old!

The documentary, Bringing Godzilla Down to Size, also included on the Rodan disc, is interesting and informative, though it shortchanges a bit in the clips department.

The War of the Gargantuas is a wonder to behold in widescreen. Several other reviewers have mentioned that the Japanese language version is a bit dark, however, I didn't find that it detracted from my enjoyment of the film, it just made it seem moodier. If you're that concerned about it, you can watch the brighter dubbed version which is also available on this disc. The Japanese version restores the references that clearly place this film as a sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World. Again the picture and colors look good, and the film was just as much fun as I remembered from seeing it in my childhood. It was odd hearing Russ Tamblyn dubbed in the Japanese version however.

All in all, a fantastic bargain for the price, and probably as good as you're going to get for these films.",1224288000,3,1712,4.662251655629139

3465396,5,B001AR0D40,"This is a good time to be a fan of Japanese kaiju flicks.  For years we suffered through badly edited and badly dubbed releases just to get a glimpse of our favorite monsters.  But now there is Classic Media, putting out the best releases of some of the most obscure kaiju films, and doing them with a respect and quality I never imagined possible.  It is a dream come true!

This two DVD set contains two of the most sought-after films, 1956's ""Rodan"" (""Sora no daikaiju Radon"" or ""Giant Monster of the Sky Radon"") and 1966's ""War of the Gargantuas"" (""Frankenstein no Kaiju: Sanda tai Gaira"" or ""Frankenstein's Monster: Sanda vs. Gaira).  Both have had previous US releases, but with considerable edits and we are seeing the full films here for the first time.  As with other Classic Media titles in the Godzilla series, both versions of the films are included, the original Japanese release and the US dubbed and edited version.  It is nice to have both, but it doesn't take a genius to know which one you should be watching!  Interesting bonus documentaries are also included, making this set an absolute must have.

""Rodan"" was the first kaiju flick filmed in color, and the mutated pteranodons still look great.  Although a single Rodan would soon crossover into the Godzilla series with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghidorah-The-Three-Headed-Monster/dp/B000OCY7IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster</a>, here there are actually two of the beasties to torment Japan, a male and a female.  Because they can fly, ""Rodan"" is quite quick paced and action-packed compared to many kaiju flicks, as the two monsters zoom around doing battle with jet airplanes and destroying bridges.  No slow motion stomping here. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending of ""Rodan"" is a tear-jerker, a hard task for a film featuring men in giant rubber suits.

""War of the Gargantuas"" is a real treasure, and I am so happy to finally have a nice copy on DVD.  A sequel to the 1966&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Conquers-the-World/dp/B000JU8H7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Conquers the World</a>, (but not to the planned but never produced ""Godzilla vs. Frankenstein"". Sigh...), the story has the mutated cells of the Frankenstein monster spawning two giant hairy beasts, Sanda (mountain monster) and Gaira (outside monster).  Because the both monsters are human-like, the suitimation really shines here, and the two beasts are able to get really down and dirty in their battle.  In fact, their fight was the basis for the battle between The Bride and Elle Driver in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00068ULLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>.  It is knock-down drag out.

3465397,5,B001AR0D40,"I have been waiting for 'War of the Gargantuas' to be released on DVD for many years. I had not seen this film in 30 years and I have to say the wait was worth it! The U.S. film print here looks very good and the film is more fun than I remembered. Even better is the inclusion of the original Japanese release. Unfortunately, the Japanese print is dark and not very crisp, but since my concern was for the film I grew up with, this is acceptable to me. The Japanese version is nice to see for curiosity, but I don't see me watching it more than once or twice.

Now about the film, if your a fan of Godzilla type films (ToHo), I really don't need to point out that these films are not meant to be taken too seriously....at least in America! This film is a hoot and the FX are actually pretty good for the most part. The scene with the green ""Gargantua"" attacking the airport is a stand out!

This film was a quasi-sequel to 'Frankenstein Conquers The World', but all references to the first film were removed when release in the U.S. 'Sanda VS Gailah Frankenstein's Monsters' (the original Japanese title) has never looked so good!

'Rodan' which is featured on the first disc in this 2 disc set is another good film from the studio, but unfortunately, my copy would not play, so I sent for a replacement, it wouldn't play either!?? I am surprised I am the only reviewer who has experienced this problem...or at least mentioned it. The 'Rodan' disc has a new documentary on it, which is very interesting with tons of obscure photos and insight. Happy ""Shocktober"" to all my horror buddies! from yours truly Dr. Shock!

this one has the American & Japanese version of Gargantuas and Rodan This
was my first time seeing Gargantuas in an American widescreen version All
versions prior were always full screen. (there is a momentary sound pause
after the credits which leads me to believe that two different sources of
film might have been used) For those who are fans of the Japanese version
which uses more of the Akira score, BEWARE that this print of the film is
extremely dark so dark in fact that many of the night shots come out very
shadowy. This was my first and only complaint with Classic Media who have
up to now have always presented such high quality films prints. That said
all else including the Rodan prints were flawless. Also included is grand
little featurette which showcases the unsung heroes and technicians that
made Toho studios this is really a well put together piece that shows the
care (and sometimes turmoil) of the greatest monster studio that ever was

This is a perfect double-feature: RODAN and WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS are two of my favorites. Plus, there's also a wonderful documentary, BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE.

So with all this going for it, why does this set only get four stars? Well, not to be an ingrate, but I do have some minor quibbles. Both RODAN or WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS are bereft of Extras ... no commentaries or theatrical trailers. Nothing. (On the Japanese laserdisc edition of RODAN, the lovely overture is included, as well as an exciting theatrical trailer. Why couldn't those have been included here?) Also, the Japanese print of WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS is too dark during several passages, while the American print is sharp and clear. Perhaps a commentary track would have explained this discrepancy.

That said, however, I'm grateful to have these films in both the American and original Japanese editions. These titles have often been severely underappreciated by film historians and scholars. But fans know that these are two top-notch efforts brimming with superb special effects, representing those talented Toho craftsman at their very best.

The price is a steal! and to make things better, Classic Media has made a brand new Godzilla Documentary, with some of the most iconic people ever involved in the franchise, including my idol, HARUO NAKAJIMA, who portrayed Godzilla and many more monsters in the Showa era.

3465413,4,B001AR0D40,"RODAN and THE WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS are two of Toho's best giant monster films, and both were subjected to awkward and unnecessary Americanization jobs. With this welcome release, USA fans can now easily and cheaply make their comparisons, as Japanese and USA versions of both films are generously included.

GARGANTUAS is especially long-awaited, but, sadly, Classic Media's transfer of the Toho version is a letdown. Toho's print has always been darker, with less-saturated color than the UPA (not AIP!) print. This transfer, however, is WAY too dark, and not terribly sharp; in the scenes with Gailah vs. the military, he often looks like little more than a shadow...just awful! No, my TV settings are not to blame- this transfer is plain inferior to Toho's Laserdisc and DVD releases, which is odd when you consider how many nice DVDs of the Godzilla titles have been released by Classic Media. All the more unfortunate is that the Japanese version of GARGANTUAS works much better as a movie than the English-dubbed one. That version LOOKS much better on this DVD, but its problems are well-known and numerous. Said problems are probably the fault of the late and notoriously clueless producer, Henry Saperstein...I can just envision him looking at the rushes, smoking a huge cigar, and saying, ""Don't look like no Frankenstein to me!"". So, the Frankenstein references are gone, along with much of the integrity of the screenplay. Gone, also, is much of Ifukube's fine score. (replaced by stupid library music, and even by Ifukube music from previous films: why?) Add to this some ill-advised editing, and Russ Tamblyn instead of Nick Adams...Tamblyn is clearly about half past give-a-damn throughout, though his presence may not be all UPA's fault. Bottom line: this kaiju classic was nearly ruined by gaijin interference. Still, this is the version that most USA fans fondly remember, and the monster mayhem and great Toho cast make GARGANTUAS pretty tough to dislike, so it's good to finally have it.

Both versions of RODAN are fine, and the Japanese print looks great. The USA version has been released before, has many of the same issues as GARGANTUAS, but isn't nearly as painful to watch, apart from the absurd stock footage and narration. I've always been fond of RODAN.

No trailers, galleries or commentaries are included here, which doesn't bother me that much. What is included is the outstanding documentary, BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE...no, it doesn't sing the praises of GODZILLA VS. MEGALON and the like, and that clearly irks some fans, but it does pay attention to several lesser-known (but still significant) Toho FX craftsmen. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

All things considered, a flawed but still worthwhile release for Kaiju fans, especially at this bargain price.",1221177600,51,2792,5.102844638949672
3465414,4,B001AR0D40,"It's a great time to be a kaiju fan, and the release of RODAN and WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS give us even more reason to cheer. Both films are prized for their sequences of wholesale city smashing, as well as being great examples of what a kaiju film is all about. Monsters attack, the military is unable to deal with the threat, and science tries to figure out just what the new menace really is. The FX work is vintage TOHO and Tsuburaya, colorful, well photographed, not ""realistic"" in a western sense, but amazingly vibrant and a joy to see. GARGANTUAS is released in a 16x9 anamorphic print, finally putting an end to the horrible pan and scan approach that robbed the films of almost half their image. The film is available in a subtitled version (which I prefer) as well as the original AIP English dub, which does have a strong nostalgic appeal.  Picture wise...the surprise here is how much better the English dubbed print looks over its subtitled cut. The picture is brighter...cleaner...and much more detailed, where the subtitled original  Japanese version is too dark...and worst of all....grainy and suffering compression artifacts galore. How Classic Media screwed this up so much is beyond me.  I own the imported region 2 DVD from Japan and the quality is far superior...dark...but not over dark, and well detailed. To me it looks like a very poorly authored DVD...there is really no excuse for such shoddy work.

 RODAN, the first TOHO kaiju film to be shot in color is also available Subtitled and dubbed, but stay with the subtitled print, which is superior in picture and sound. Rodan was shot in academy ratio...no wide screen here, but the subtitled print is a wonderful presentation, with bold colors and great detail. So much detail as a matter of fact that wires that were invisible in older prints are clearly visible in quite a number of shots. It would have been nice to have included a commentary track on these films, especially a subtitled version of the commentary from the original Japanese DVD.

The bonus feature is on the RODAN DVD. Titles BRINGING GODZILLA DOWN TO SIZE, and nicely narrated by filmmaker Alex Cox, it is a nostalgic trip thru SOME of Godzilla's history, and focuses on some of the unheralded talents behind the Godzilla films. Written by 3 of the better known Godzilla historians, Norman England, Steve Ryfle and Ed Godzeweski, the film is a nostalgic trip thru the Godzilla series....well...Some of the series. It would be impossible to argue about their combined knowledge of these films, but they seem to feel that Godzilla Films ended around 1969 with DESTROY ALL MONSTERS. Having read quite a bit written by these 3 on Godzilla history, it was always clear that they have little use for the films made after the 70s...often lobbing attacks on the films while seeing the original films thru very nostalgic rose colored glasses.  The series from 1985 thru 2005 (7 Heisie films and 6 Millennium films) are only casually mentioned, with only Godzilla actor  Satsuma and GMK director Shusuke Kaneko given anything to say. To overlook such excellent Godzilla films as GMK, BIOLLANTE and DESTROYER, films that restored the Godzilla series to a dignified status after so many dreadful productions, is a huge failing. These are the films that rescued Godzilla from being a punch line, and the people involved showed that using mostly traditional Tokuatsu techniques, amazing images could still be created. Not to mention that with GODZILLA vs MOTHRA (1992) Godzilla became, for the first and only time, the top grossing Domestic Japanese film. So, to quote Arthur Miller's brilliant play DEATH OF A SALESMAN.....""ATTENTION MUST BE PAID!"" In spite of this kind of OTAKU approach, the documentary is enjoyable. If only it were more complete and less of a love letter to their youth
