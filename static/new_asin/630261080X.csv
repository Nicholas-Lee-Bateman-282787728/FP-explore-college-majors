Although no deal was suppose to have been made between Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, the first act President Ford carried out was to pardon his predecessor for a crime, he insisted he did not commit. In this film called "" David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon "" English Talk-show Host, David Frost, seizes a great opportunity to boost his ratings and secure several new TV shows, by arranging to interview the former Man in the White House. David Frost (Michael Sheen) plays Himself and is less convincing than his flaunted screen image. For this movie, Richard Nixon is played by exceptional actor Frank Langella, who does a remarkable job of playing the self-centered, egotistical and politically conniving ex-Congressman from California. The interview itself is fraught with planned attacks and defenses on both sides, each seeking to score points with the T.V. audiences watching across the country. Frost and Nixon hope their real motives for the Interview displays more style, than substance. Yet, after watching the entire movie, one believes there could have been more secured than ethereal coronets and self pity. The highlight of the film leans towards Langella when emotion, not confrontation becomes the final victory. This is one movie which should be seen by History and Political Science students in every school dealing with Watergate and Presidential authority. ****",1267833600,,1506,5.20164609053498

I was a kid of 12 when this was aired in 1977, but lived in a politically active household and remember watching this.  When I got older and became interested in politics, I wanted to see this again, but it wasn't available.  If you're interested in history and/or politics, this is mandatory.  Frost doesn't pitch the softballs that people have accused him of in the past.  His interview style is clever, but to-the-point.  I've always been a bit fascinated by Nixon and his presidency.  To me, it's invaluable to hear his diplomacy, waffling, lying, sincerity, candor and wisdom.  He was truly one of the most memorable characters in U.S. history...a true dichotomy in the purest form.",1201132800,5,813,4.669014084507042
