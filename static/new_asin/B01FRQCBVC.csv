7751723,5,B01FRQCBVC,We have been fans of Montalbano for years both from the books written by Andrea Camilleri and the excellent TV series from Italy.  Always happy to see that there are new episodes.  One of the best television series ever!!!  As a student of the Italian language it is fun to watch with the subtitles and then rewatch again without them for practice!!,1497657600,,349,4.596774193548387
7751724,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Always delightful and human. I love this series! Montalbano and his fellow detectives rely on their knowledge of human nature, rather than computers.",1491436800,,149,5.521739130434782
7751725,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Salvo is loveable and brilliantly human. I pray Luca Zingaretti lives forever so Salvo may live long and prosper.

7751727,5,B01FRQCBVC,excellent,1488240000,,9,9.0
7751728,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Detective Montalbano always meets my expectations.  It is among the finest of screen adaptations of a novel.  Great acting, stunning scenery, and authentic Sicilian setting.  It's funny and intelligent and provides an excellent opportunity for practicing Italian!",1487203200,,263,6.054054054054054
7751729,5,B01FRQCBVC,Great to see him back again. Let's hope that there will be more. Enjoyed it no end and what a change from our scruffy lot with all their personal problems. The writers of police drama's in this country could learn a lot from the Montalbano series',1486512000,,247,4.391304347826087
7751730,5,B01FRQCBVC,Great  as usual.,1484870400,,16,4.333333333333333
7751731,5,B01FRQCBVC,I have this whole series and have watched them all twice and loaned them to friends who have all enjoyed this series. As you get to know and understand the humour behind the various characters you get caught up in every segment .You can see its success as more famous guests appear and the acting does not appear to be anything but real people in the later sections. I have a bad feeling this is the lasy and while I also own Young Montalbano it does not make you feel he grows into the elder.,1480636800,2,493,4.2
7751732,3,B01FRQCBVC,"We need more episodes for this very sucessfull series. Also Young Montalblano was nearly as good. I have got the compleate set of both and hope
some more will be made.",1478390400,,167,4.419354838709677
7751733,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Keeps getting better; has not lost any of its magic, especially the portrayal by Luca Zingaretti. Hope more are in the works",1477440000,,124,4.681818181818182
7751734,5,B01FRQCBVC,Never fails to entertain. And I like the new Livia!,1477353600,,51,4.2
7751735,5,B01FRQCBVC,"The Montalbano movies are absolute treasures. Zingaretti is perfect as Detective Montalbano. As in the novels, these stories have it all: intrigue, pathos, humor and splendid realizations of Camilleri's characters. My only sorrow is that there aren't more.",1474675200,2,256,5.7631578947368425
7751736,5,B01FRQCBVC,He might be getting older but he's still solving crime in style. Two excellent episodes although I'm not keen on the new Livia !,1474675200,2,128,4.375
7751737,5,B01FRQCBVC,Love the Moatabano series. Great stories with characters.,1473552000,,57,6.25

7751739,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Exciting, funny, extremely entertaining.",1473206400,,40,9.25
7751740,5,B01FRQCBVC,"Been waiting to some new episodes and my husband and I were not disappointed.  As always the dynamics between Montalbano and his fellow police officers are  fun to watch and  the way they arrive  at the solution to the crimes is always interesting  We watch a lot of mysteries and in our opinion Montalbano is the best and most entertaining to watch.  I hope they continue with this series.  Oh, and did I mention the scenery is enough to get you wanting to be where this is filmed.",1472774400,3,482,4.409090909090909
7751741,5,B01FRQCBVC,GREAT as always! Love it!,1472688000,,25,4.2
7751742,5,B01FRQCBVC,As good as ever. Luca Zingaretti IS Inspector Montalbano! And the interview with Andrea Camilleri is very enlightening.,1472515200,,119,5.666666666666667
7751743,5,B01FRQCBVC,GREAT!!! This adds to my other 26 episodes and is not disappointing. I look forward to future episodes ( hopefully } great series.,1471824000,2,130,4.695652173913044

7751748,5,B01FRQCBVC,Love this series!,1470787200,,17,5.0
7751749,3,B01FRQCBVC,"Something was missing in these two episode. seemed as though luca phoned in his performance. and this third livia was the worse, wooden and unattractive. instead of 3 episodes they wasted a dvd with camillari's life story. would have preferred 3rd episode. am finding young montalbano, the prequel, much more enjoyable",1470268800,8,318,5.254901960784314
7751750,5,B01FRQCBVC,We love the series and share them with our family. Just not enough time in the day to get to them fast enough!,1470268800,,110,3.8260869565217392
8761418,2,B01FRQCBVC,"The stories themselves and the acting are great as usual. However the DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Brunetti  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's at high cost, rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. Mhz has literally massacred the images. They seem to use high data compression, with only the faces approximating high resolution and even then, the edges show image artifacts and pixelation. Backgrounds are blurry. I have seen you tube videos of higher quality with only a 2mbs/sec internet connection ! Also I had purchased the first DVD's for the series which were not Mhz and the quality was much higher. It is unfortunate that MHz got the rights for these series as they show no respect for the image. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1028,4.726256983240224
8761419,5,B01FRQCBVC,"We have all of the episodes and see that two are ready to go; waiting for the subtitles.  In April they filmed two more episodes.  He's a marvelous actor; Fazio, Mimi - but do not like the 'new' Livia at all.  Much preferred the original one.",1525305600,,242,4.217391304347826

8761421,5,B01FRQCBVC,"As you can see, these are later episodes, our family really likes the shows, and we are filling out our collection. Wonderful acting, great plots. I have read all of Andrea Camilleris books, and became interested in the show. Benefit is I am learning a little Italian.",1517270400,,268,4.723404255319149

8761427,3,B01FRQCBVC,"Although we both enjoyed Detective Montalbano #27 & 28 we both thought the story lines were not as good as most of the other Montalbano episodes.  Still, one of the best detective/mystery shows we've seen!",1504742400,,205,4.857142857142857
