8398083,5,B000BGWEFC,"This is a simple family based story, and is touching and meaningful. The ending is a bit simplistic, and could have been handled better. Also, there are several plugs in the movie for stuff like engine oil, etc.! Overall, worth the time spent! If you like movies based on emotions, and heart-tugging, this is for you.",1128038400,6,317,4.678571428571429
