8292378,2,B0006J285U,"This movie appears to be shot on video, and it is cheaply made.  The female stars include Amber Michaels, Holly Hollywood, and Alana Evans.

The plot is laughable, if you even notice it at all.  There are five scenes, all B/G, a fairly plain and boring format, IMO.  Amber has one scene.  Holly and Alana have two scenes each.  One thing that stood out was the length of the scenes.  They go on for 10 to 15 minutes, which is fairly long when compared to other softcore films.  Maybe you'll like that, maybe you won't.  I think I fell asleep.  That's not good!

I just wasn't impressed.  I've seen a lot better.  However, I did want to give credit to Amber Michaels.  I dug her scene a lot.  She was really hot in her performance, but like I said, she only has the one scene.

The jury is still out for these new releases from Trinity.  It may be cheaply made, but it is also cheap to buy.  I'll give them credit for that.  I didn't feel ripped off, so I'll try another title from them in the future.  As for this film, the only redeeming aspect was Amber Michaels' performance in the one scene.  Just to be clear, she doesn't do anything really notable.  I just seem to have taken a liking to her.  However if you are a die-hard fan of hers, I would still question whether this purchase would be worth it.  Personally, I would just keep my eyes open for another title with her in it.",1111449600,25,1384,4.234615384615385
