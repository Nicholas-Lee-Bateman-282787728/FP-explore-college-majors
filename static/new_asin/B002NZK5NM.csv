8375634,5,B002NZK5NM,"Clear and easy to understand. The quality is very good I could detect no problems in sound or the video itself.
Certainly an excellent way to get younger children to experience the exuberance and oddness of that wonderful creation Pippi Longstocking! They even manage to have morality thrown in without looking forced. Too bad they only made 26 episodes in all. There are 4 episodes on this DVD. Enjoyable for the whole family. Funny and just a little bit educational.

   The aforementioned Christmas story.
   ""Pippi goes North"" to deliver supplies and finds a wonderful Inuit-like society and to protect whales from poachers.
   ""Pippi enters the Big Race"" is a ski race among the various towns in the area.
   ""Pippi Finds a Mysterious Footprint"" and a stuffed shirt cryptolbiogist hunting for whatever it is.",1403136000,,813,5.022556390977444

8375636,5,B002NZK5NM,This was a wonderful video that arrived just in time to enjoy before Christmas. Pippi is my 7 yr. old granddaughter's best friend and she loved it! It made waiting for Christmas even more exciting.  Phyllis/Troy/NY,1295049600,,214,4.944444444444445
8375637,4,B002NZK5NM,"This disc contains four episodes: (1) Pippi's Christmas, (2) Pippi Enters the Big Race, (3) Pippi Goes Up North, (4) Pippi Finds a Mysterious Footprint. They constitute four of the 26 Pippi animated shows produced in 1998--they are numbers 8, 14, 17, and 22. Others are also available; I will post the results of my Pippi Project when I have finished the research, which may take some time. I do not understand why these 26 programs, which are easily available in a boxed set from Germany, are found only here and there on this side of the Atlantic, considering that the series apparently premiered in the USA and Canada a year before they were seen in Germany.",1281312000,9,661,4.6581196581196584
