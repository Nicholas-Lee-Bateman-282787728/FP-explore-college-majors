4596846,4,B0057JIR0Y,"The story could have benfited from tighter focus and fewer subplots--a couple of the characters seemed extraneous--and some developments felt really contrived, but overall, this is a highly effective representation of the sub-sub genre, ""home invasion horror.""  Rebecca De Mornay reminds us that she is very talented at playing a certain type of intense character.  My expectations were contained going in, and they were substantially exceeded.  I give Anchor Bay credit for releasing some of the better horror I've seen in the past few years.  One thing: I realize this is a remake so probably no one had much choice in what to call the film, but ""Mother's Day"" is a pretty stupid title for it.  Unless you're Norma Bates, do NOT get this as a Mother's Day gift!",1336521600,,763,4.883720930232558
4596847,5,B0057JIR0Y,"I loved this movie, it is way more violent (intense torture scenes) than I thought it would be, but that is a good thing.  It is also full of little twist and turns, secrets, betrayals, and revenge.  The story starts quickly and holds your attention and you will love the irony of the ending.  The best part of the movie is the decisions that the victims are forced to make to survive, you will be asking yourself if you could or would make the same decisions.  Just sit back and enjoy.",1336435200,9,486,4.3076923076923075
4596848,2,B0057JIR0Y,"When it comes to the work of director Darren Lynn Bousman, I'm pretty torn. He almost always does a movie with this really fantastic concept, but its execution is never really as sweet as the bite it promises. I loved the concept of Repo! The Genetic Opera, but felt like nothing really meshed together properly. They had the talent, but it was as if Lionsgate just threw everyone into a room and hoped for the best. Meanwhile the Saw sequels Bousman did are perhaps what he's best known for. Saw III is probably his best effort, but is still a bit lackluster in comparison to the original Saw (a personal favorite). His remake of Mother's Day has actually been in the can since December of 2009, but is just now getting an official release. It might be Bousman's best film to date, but its content may put some people off.

Mother's Day doesn't really do anything wrong. The cast is incredibly strong and everyone goes above and beyond what is needed for them. Mother (played by Rebecca De Mornay) is the person people will be talking about the most. Her methods of raising children are pretty disturbing and even though she's pretty twisted herself, she still has that mother-like quality to her that only makes every situation a bit creepier. The fight she has with Beth (Jaime King) is spectacular. Who knew a fight between two women could be so brutal? Ike (Patrick Flueger) is the most determined of Mother's children while Addley (Warren Kole) flies off the handle at every turn. Addley's tendency to jump the gun is key to some of the film's most gory and memorable scenes. Shawn Ashmore's performance as George is really noteworthy though. He did a really great job in Frozen a few years back, but he plays a doctor this time around and he seems to show the most courage of the men being held hostage next to Treshawn (Lyriq Bent from Saw II, III, and IV).

The camera work was a bit more enjoyable in Mother's Day than in a good portion of Bousman's previous works. His work has often been described as having a music video-like quality to it, but Mother's Day never really doesn't feel raw or gritty. A favorite scene of mine is when Addley accidentally shoots somebody in the head, but it's far enough off-screen that you only see the blood splatter. You see everyone else's horrific reactions first before Addley says he didn't mean to do that and you finally see the aftermath. The story is easy to follow and the blood and gore effects are pretty top notch. On the surface, Mother's Day is a home run.

The unfortunate thing is I just found myself not caring about the major events in the film. Maybe it's because nearly every character in the film is either a mean-spirited bastard right from the beginning or is revealed to be one through their actions as the film progresses. I'm also just not big on torture movies these days. Mother's Day had this vibe to it that was similar to both Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door and the remake to I Spit on Your Grave in the sense that it was done well, but it just wasn't really enjoyable due to its content. Mother's Day never really gives you somebody to root for. Everyone is tainted in some capacity and while that's interesting on one hand, it makes things a little dull in the long run.

Mother's Day is a relentless and brutal journey. While it does feature superb acting, spot-on cinematography, and top notch make-up effects, it just seems to be missing something to really make you feel for these characters and the sadistically tragic experience they were just put through. It's like the film is lacking just an ounce of compassion or doesn't have genuine human qualities correctly balanced out to pull you in. It's not a complete waste of time, but it's not really entirely worthwhile either.

The DVD/Blu-ray for Mother's Day is extremely bare bones as the only special feature is Audio Commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actor Shawn Ashmore.

Mother's Day is being released as a single disc DVD and a DVD + Blu-ray combo pack on Tuesday, May 8th. The film is rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and torture, pervasive language and some sexual content, is presented in a 2.40:1 widescreen aspect ratio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (Blu-ray) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD), and is available with both English and Spanish subtitles. It is approximately 112 minutes in length. Mother's Day will be available in most retail outlets and online stores.",1336435200,,4427,4.654731457800511
4596849,5,B0057JIR0Y,This remake is great and kept me on the edge of my seat. So happy that it's finally getting released. Definitely worth checking out!,1336176000,,132,4.541666666666667
4596850,3,B0057JIR0Y,"""Look at me, if someone's lying there will be consequences. I guarantee it."" After three teens commit a crime they run to their mother's house for safety. When they get there they find out that the home was foreclosed on and there are now new people living there. The mother (De Mornay) shows up and begins to take control to get her and her boys out safe. I have to say that going in I was expecting a pretty lame B movie. This was much better then I thought. Very tense and pretty scary in the fact that this movie could actually happen. Imagine having a party with your friends when a group of criminals with guns show up thinking it's their house. What would you do. This movie is made for me by the fact that Rebecca De Mornay is playing a similar character that she played in ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"". She has the same level of ""normal-creepiness"" that is makes her seem at once normal and insane. To me that is creepy. This is a good watch. Overall, if the woman from ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" grew up this is the type of person and movie it would become. I give it a B.",1335571200,12,1084,4.1913875598086126
4596851,3,B0057JIR0Y,"MOTHER'S DAY starts out as a fairly well made, engrossing thriller, then about midway through the picture, it takes a nose-dive.  Violence and gore go way over the top and characters start behaving in very unbelievable ways.

Apparently director Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed three of the Saw movies, was trying to appeal to that same audience, but the sad fact is that, with the talent involved here, a more moderate and realistic approach to the material might have appealed to a much broader group of viewers.

The screenwriters seem to have borrowed elements from THE DESPERATE HOURS, RESERVOIR DOGS and KEY LARGO in this story about a trio of bank robbing brothers, escaping from a heist that went wrong, who take refuge in their family home, only to discover that their mother doesn't live there any longer.  Instead, they find it occupied by a couple, throwing a party for several friends, and they take them hostage.

With one of the trio badly wounded from the robbery, they phone their mother, who arrives to take charge of the situation, which involves the terrorizing and torture of the eight hostages, all of whom have their own dark secrets revealed on this horrifying night.

The cast is quite good, particularly Rebecca  De Mornay, who plays the maniacal mother, but even her fine performance dissipates as the movie's blood fest escalates.  It's too bad that these filmmakers have not heard that LESS IS MORE.

The 2-disc DVD/Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by the director and actor Shawn Ashmore.

4596852,4,B0057JIR0Y,"This movie turned out to be much more than I expected. It was quite a little gem in fact with equal parts suspense & splatter. I found myself glued to the screen and at times, not sure if I should root for the goodies or the badies. It's not overly pleasant (what do you expect from the director of Saw 2, 3 & 4) but entertaining nonetheless.",1331596800,8,342,4.119402985074627
4596853,4,B0057JIR0Y,"Many of you eagerly awaiting to see this remake need hold on just a bit longer. Many are probably asking themselves ""It's finished...so why the hold-up (no pun intended...)"". All I can think of, seriously, is that the producers and directors can't find a way to release it theatrically in the USA without it receiving an NC-17. Within 5 minutes of it's beginning it gets very violent and doesn't let up. Not really a horror movie as it is a crime drama/thriller, it really packs a punch to your gut and never lets up. It's almost non-stop action and very brutal. To avoid this problem though of always having to wait for films to appear stateside, I suggest investing in a region free DVD player (that cost as little as $65.00 U.S. Funds if purchased on-line) and you can watch any DVD that rears it's ugly digital-celluloid head much sooner, (if ever), than their USA counterparts...you will NEVER be sorry. Back to Mother's Day, as for an official US release, I don't know, thats a tough call. It's not a follow-up to the original other than a couple of nods in that the ""boys"" have the same names (Adley)...and one of them mentions that he hates Disco, etc. All I can say in closing is that if you wait your just taking you're chances that you'll see a domestic release or as time goes on you'll just forget about it. It is a good one so I would make the effort to get it ASAP. You'll be happy you did...",1319587200,17,1407,4.415384615384616
4596854,3,B0057JIR0Y,"A rare thing: a slasher/horror remake. Rarer: a worthwhile slasher/horror remake. Unique: a worthwhile remake of a worthless slasher/horror.

Legend, and common consensus, has it that 1980's original Mother's Day was a tasteless, exploitative and low rent sort of a picture. It bombed on release, and a cursory look at its trailer gives a fairly good clue as to why.

So you wonder how it was that agents for luminaries like Brett Ratner - he of the later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dragon/dp/B0001HK21Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dragon</a>&nbsp;- and Rebecca De Mornay (whose hand once rocked the cradle) came to have nothing more interesting in the script in tray than a re-tread of a lemon.

Be that as it may they didn't, and to everyone's surprise they and director Darren Lynn Bousman, whose credits include Saws&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2/dp/B000DZV7G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3/dp/B000LXS8MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4/dp/B000Z63YRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4</a>&nbsp;(but not Saw 1) - and accordingly can at least claim to be a re-tread specialist - have crafted something surprisingly effective, taut and entertaining from such paucitous material. In fairness, but for the characters' names, they seem to have rewritten the story altogether.

A prelude introduces us to a baby snatching gang at work in an obstetrics ward, and in the grisly manner of the security guard's offing, hints as to the sort of entertainment that is coming. But for a backlit spume of blood we don't linger, though: the film pitches us forward to a modest suburban house-warming party some years later. Four couples groove knowingly to disco retro, shoot pool, and bond quite well. Apparently.

Catapulting towards them, in a ghastly misunderstanding, are fleeing bank-robber brothers Ike, Adley and Johnny, the last of whom has been shot in flagrante and is in a bad way. They need to get home to - well, to their mum.

The problem is - and the moral of the story here is keep up your monthly mortgage payments or your house may be repossessed, and hope like hell your vendor did too - mother has, unbeknownst to the boys, recently been turfed out of the house. And Ike has lost the special phone he was meant to call her on, so the boys don't know this. They arrive in the middle of said housewarming.

At which point you have your usual ""get the hell out of my house/no YOU get the hell out of MY house"" standoff, house guests become hostages, indiscriminate violence ensues and mother (now contacted on her other phone) is summoned to sort everything out.

Now this must be one hell of a mother.

And so she turns out: Rebecca De Mornay arrives, twin-setted and pearled, reprising all her cradle rocking freakiness, to lays out her pitch for the Hannibal Lecter of the new decade. She never gets quite to that point, but the action and suspense is cleverly built and Bousman never quite lets you off the edge of your seat afterwards.

You won't be surprised to hear that the superficial sheen binding the hostages starts to dissolve. At the same time we start learning the murderous family's back story, and horrid things start to happen to the poor hostages.

Now while, as you'd expect, the film has a pretty nasty undertone (being a gory thriller, and all), it's nothing like as nasty as the original Mother's Day (which seems to have been positively repulsive) and liberals amongst you might take something out of the strength of pretty much all the female characters (for the most part contrasting sharply with the feebleness of the men). That said, I can't see this making a case study for Feminist Studies 101 any time soon.

It might, on the other hand, serve as one for a make-up artist's diploma: the are more gruesome injuries (faces shot, heads shot off, gunshot wounds, stab wounds, burns, blisters, splatter on the doors) than I've seen in a while. This tendency to the graphic over the implied detracts rather than adds to the suspense: I didn't find the film scary or horrifying so much as just plain unpleasant.

Mother's Day is a serviceable and well-paced film, but (again, as these films seem to be) studded with plot implausibilities: The robbers don't simply turn tail and bolt as soon as they find the house occupied. They imprison their victims in a room containing a rack of pool cues and steak knives (in a presentation box!) The hostages hit each other with the pool cues but not, despite ample opportunity, their captors. And, as is seemingly de rigueur in films of this sort, people who ought really to be well and truly dead have a habit of getting up and continuing to contribute to narrative development.

It is also, in the main, well scripted and surprisingly well acted. Eldest son Ike carries the screen well, if he fails to inject quite enough malice: you can't help thinking he's really a nice chap. Younger brother Adley captures the deranged psycho well, and De Mornay's mother is chilling, though she does nibble occasionally on the set, if not completely chewing scenery.

The film surges over the credibility (and coherence) line in the last scenes where Bousman's desire to yet further amp up the tension instead undermines it entirely, cascading the picture into farce.

This is an honest effort for what it is (I don't have any particular fondness for the genre) although it has trouble deciding whether to be a splatter film or a psychological thriller, a cake you really can't eat and have too. Had a bit more of the violence been implied, I fancy this might have been a more chilling and effective picture.

4596855,4,B0057JIR0Y,"Loved the acting, great cast.  Very poor editing, imbecilic script writing.  After all that work killing Addley, and seeing how easily it is to grab someone's feet and pull them down the stairs, how is it  the husband stands there with a knife pointing at arms length, crying and accepting he has no choice but surrender his life without a fight?  When he took the cell phone from mother to say his tearful goodbye, with the knife extended, had to be one of the stupidest things I ever saw.  There were 2 other knives, why didn't Annette (the only one not to sustain any physical injuries) get under the stairs and run one of those knives straight up mother's  wahoo?  They had options.

And where is the ""gore""?  A shotgun wound to the stomach and open jaw surgery, that's it?  It seemed like Dave's  gunshot wound to the face was lovingly crafted by the makeup department, only to be 90% cropped out at the far left of the frame.  Someone else mentioned that was only on the Showtime release, I would rent or buy it from Amazon to see the whole frame, but who knows if Amazon did the same thing?  I want to see Dave's blown away face.  I work in horror make up effects, can't assess a make up artist's work if it is mostly cropped off screen.

I really do like the movie however, 95% due to the excellent cast. They should release a director's cut and restore the parts that break continuity.  i.e.  what suddenly provoked Addley to attack Annette early on, (before he attacked Dave's hairpiece).  They definitely cut out some of Briana Evigan's scenes, as some of her actions make no sense in continuity.",1516060800,,1607,4.482758620689655

4596873,3,B0057JIR0Y,"From the Director of Saw 2, 3, & 4 comes an even scarier film, a story that is not only brutal, but also entirely possible. Three recently released prisoners are back to their old tricks, as they have just robbed a bank and escaped a shoot out with the police. With no where else to go, they flee to a familiar place, their mother's house, only while they were away, she lost that house to the bank and it had been re-sold. The trio stumbles right into the new owners house warming party and quickly take them as hostages. These boys are brutal, but they aren't very smart, not knowing what the next step is, they do they only thing they can think of and call their dear old mother for advice. Mother's Day is your typical film about hostages held at bay, trying to escape the brutal hold of their captors, with one exception, Rebecca De Mornay, a veteran actress of these types of films. De Mornay's is the one who raised these monsters, but she's also the voice of reason, with a cool calm demeanor, that will send a chill down your spine. Her performance in this film is what takes a simple hostage film and turns it into something deeper, darker, and more sinister. Of course a film like this isn't without it's flaws, as it is extremely predictable. They throw in all the things you would expect to see in a film about a hostage situation, and outside of the named actors you recognize, the rest of the cast, wasn't very good.

4596894,3,B0057JIR0Y,"I haven't seen the original Mother's Day, so I can't comment on differences between this remake and the original movie.

The best thing about this remake version is Rebecca De Mornay's performance as Mother. Her acting is surprisingly subtle and fine-tuned. She knows when to make the most of a witty line, but also avoids campy excess.

The other actors are competent, but merely so. They're a foil to De Mornay's character. You're actually glad when Mother arrives because only after 15-20 minutes the movie starts to drag.

As is the case with lower-budget horror movies these days, Mother's Day has the customary level of sub-textual social commentary. In this case, the writer and director show that the family values De Mornay espouses no longer have any place in our current American culture, which (you guessed it) is too competitive, too selfish, and too materialistic. By the end of the movie, you really have no sense of who's right or wrong, except that maybe you sympathize with De Mornay because she turns out to be the underdog.

The problem with the movie is that it's no match for Mother as created by De Mornay. The DVD cover advertises that the director also made Saw 2, 3, and 4. I haven't seen any of those movies, but I'd expect the gore in a movie such as this to be a lot more over-the-top and imaginative than it is here. You'd need a Sam Peckinpah at best, or a Tom Savini at worst to bring this movie to life.

I'm sorry to say that Mother's Day is a hack job. You might want to see it for Rebecca De Mornay's performance, but its trite subtext and boring plot line are likewise powerful disincentives.",1448755200,,1629,4.584192439862543

One critical mistake the makers of the 2012 version made was not including the infamous, scary and horrifying witch known as "" Queeny "". She scared the living daylights out of movie goers in the eighties when the movie was released and it's a damn shame that they made quite a few references to here in the 2012 version but never showed her.

Review:

Originally when I caught Mothers Day on cable some night many years ago, I had missed the first few minutes while my crummy frozen pizza was finishing up. Ideally, if you really want to get a strong hold onto Mothers Day (2010), I highly suggest you skip the first scene in the movie. [A feminine-shaped shadow stealing a newborn from a hospital.] Not watching the first five minutes of this movie will build up to such an intense thrill that is bound to send tingles up your spine and anxiety for the survival of the extremely likeable cast whom you are consistently rooting for.

In the faux-beginning of the film, we are shown a housewarming party for Daniel and Beth Sohapi (Frank Grillo & Jaime King). Its pretty clear that its a birthday party, but in a perfect world, this is a housewarming party. Anyway, the party attendees are married couple Treshawn and Gina Jackson (Lyriq Bent & Kandyse McClure), funny guy Dave Lowe (Tony Nappo) and his charming fianc&eacute;e Annette Langston (Briana Evigan), single mother Melissa (Jessie Rusu) and her doctor boyfriend, George Barnum (Shawn Ashmore) and finally Julie Ross (Lisa Marcos) who honestly has absolutely no place to be at this party since she is not-so-low-key sleeping with married Daniel. The group talk amongst themselves playfully and socially drink, Annette does a seductive dance and Julie creeps in a corner trying awaiting to get some peen in her. With a tornado and massive storm on the way, Daniel assures his friends that the basement, where they are currently partying, is basically a bomb shelter. George, Melissa, and the Jackson couple plan on leaving shortly to return home after having birthday cake.

Meanwhile, in the wake of the storm, three brothers depart a bank heist empty handed with one near fatally wounded. The Koffin brothers: Ike, Addley, and Johnny (Patrick Flueger, Warren Cole, & Matt OLeary) are fleeing throughout rural Nebraska as teenager Johnny begins to bleed out. With nowhere else left to turn, Ike demands they go to their mothers home. From context clues from Addley and Johnny, we can gather that they all, individually for whatever reason, haven't spoken to their mother in quite some time.

The Koffin brothers barge into their mothers old home, which is now the Sohapi home. Beth and Daniel hear rummaging upstairs and go to investigate, only to be ambushed by the brothers. Beth at one point even makes a daring escape from her home and screams to her (new) neighbors but she is immediately pulled back in. Addley seriously wants to murder Daniel and Beth and leave immediately. Ike almost agrees, until Beth convinces him that a doctor is in the basement and can help his dying brother, in exchange for their lives. Beth invites George upstairs and with absolute remorse and fear apologizes to him as hes captured immediately by the criminal brothers. While Beth tries for another escape; Julie comes upstairs being nosey about where her closet lover is, and starts off a horrifying music video to Gloria Gaynors Let Me Know. The upbeat song plays in the background as Julie runs downstairs terrified and Addley gives her chase with a gun. Julies face is injured as she tries to escape through a cellar door. Addley has everyone on the hardwood floor of the beautiful, finished basement. Hes angered at how the new home is decorated; modern and sleek. One is given the thought that he considers the Sohapis wealthy compared to his low-brow, criminal lifestyle. Addley steals everyones belongings, including Daves toupee after nearly sexually assaulting Annette.

Ike has gotten ahold of his Mother (Rebecca De Morray) via sister Lydia (Deborah Ann Woll) and finally all of the Koffin family are united at their old home. While Lydia couldn't be happier to see her brothers, Mother is upset at the lack of contact, her sons actions, and their empty bank accounts. Ike briefly speaks with his mother and mentions money hes been sending to the current Sohapi address, about a grand. This pisses off mother, so much to ignore her temporarily dying son. She is aggressive only when speaking to Ike, while she babies the rest of her children and the party guests.

Mother questions Daniel and Beth over the missing money. Both plea they have no idea what she is talking about. She believes only Daniel to be lying and has Addley and Ike break his fingers with a billiard ball. Afterwards, Mother Koffin continues to rob the party guests and snatches their debit cards and PIN numbers. She takes everything from the guests except for Ginas wedding ring, which has extended generations. Mother is oddly sympathetic towards the women while being ignorant to the men. Melissa tries to escape and gets so far as the front door, only to be shot in the face by Addley. Mother sends Ike and Beth to ditch Melissas body and hit up a nearby ATM. Once they depart, Mother Koffin tells George that if Johnny dies; everyone in the basement will be murdered.

While Beth and Ike are out; Mother reminisces around her old home and notices all of her possessions are tossed. Still acting strangely maternal, Mother invites Annette upstairs and while complimenting her, scolds her on a lifestyle and assumes she isn't close with her parents due to her wild child appearance and aura. Annette is informed to play by the rules and know her role if she wishes to survive. A police officer (Mike OBrien) comes to the door, warning of the storm and the criminal brothers. The officer is suspicious of Daniel, who answers the door nervously while a gun points at his side. Daniel insists everything is fine; in order to keep himself and his friends alive. When Daniel returns to the basement, his friends are furious he did not mention anything to the police. Mother rages that Daniel is just too good of a liar and forces Lydia to check all throughout the house to find their mailed cash. Lydia discovers a love letter, from Julie to Daniel. The letter further drives Mother mad as she continues to believe Daniel is nothing but a liar. Meanwhile, George is still tending to Johnny upstairs while trying to convince a wavering Lydia to turn the tables on her family. She listens intently and openly disagrees with some of her families acts, but doesnt take her gun off of Georges head.

Intertwined is the short story of Ike and Beth. Beth bickers back and forth with Ike as if they are a cruel, abusive couple. While at the ATM, Ike forces two young girls (AJ Cook & Alexa Vega) to kill each other. He shows Beth that he is in total control and murdering one another is human nature. Hes upset with the lack of money, in fear, Beth contacts Treshawn back at her home: she needs to take money from his cash laundromat. He gives her the combination to his safe and apart of Beths slick plan, tells her where a gun is hiding in his office. Inside Treshawns business, Beth has a great escape plan, aside from you know, killing Ike, but ultimately fails. The pair heads back to the Sohapi home, encountering the same police officer Daniel had spoken with earlier. Ike kills the police officer and flips the SUV over that they have been driving. Again, Beth almost escapes but is caught by Ike who just won't quit.

Mother Koffin learns of the tragic car accident that killed Daniel and Beths only son. She blames Daniel for the loss and forces Dave and Treshawn to fight to the death over whose woman will take Johnnys virginity. The group tries to give up Julie, however, Mother deems her not worthy. Dave is beaten to a pulp by Treshawn and Annette is forced by Mother to striptease a dying Johnny and eventually perform fellatio. Annette is being assaulted upstairs, while the basement group argue with one another over Julie and Daniels affair and Ginas false friendship with Dave and Annette. Addley runs downstairs with Annette and assaults her in front of her friends and brutally beaten fianc&eacute;e. Dave measly charges at Addley, only to be shot in the face. During their scuffle, Gina escapes from the cellar door in a moment of opportunity. Mother demands Daniel go fetch her unless Beth will be murdered instantly. Daniel meets up with Gina and captures her just as their own attackers; bringing her back inside to the home invasion.

 This is where you realize that Mother Koffin is truly off her rocker; she demands Addley tie up all the basement guests, pour boiling hot water into Treshawns eyes, burn any touchable memory of the deceased Sohapi son, and also burn half of Julies head. Mother is so happy to have found her petty money and in a second of joy, the basement guests devise a fast plan and trap Addley and viciously murder him with set of gifted kitchen knives. In a struggle to take over the invasion, Treshawn blindly, fatally shoots Gina. Mother takes control and murders Treshawn and Daniel before Beth and Ike walk through the front door as the storm reaches its worst. George blows up on Mother, claiming none of the children are hers as they don't look alike and she installs fear in their minds to keep them close (and twisted). George is then shot and killed by Johnny.

Beth is proved to be pregnant and also the thief and liar of having the Koffins money. She attacks Mother and frees Annette and Julie from their restraints. Julie flees in the opposite direction of the girlfriends and is shot in the face by Ike. Ike then gives chase to Beth and Annette into the garage, where, in arguably the best scene in the film; the girls demolish Ike with a nail gun, a television, and a bottle of bleach cleaner. Annette, being the only smart girl throughout the film, leaves the home to get help with Mother and Beth brawl. Mother lights the house on fire and Beth narrowly escapes. Annette shows up with ambulance and law enforcement, who find Gina and impulsive Melissa from earlier, both barely alive.

Months later shows an about-to-pop-Beth heading into labor with friends Annette, Gina, and Melissa by her side. As Beth sleeps in the hospital, an alarm goes off: a baby boy has been stolen: Baby Boy Sohapi #2. The final scene shows Lydia driving the stolen RV with a healthy Johnny and Mother [Natalie] Koffin, holding a stolen newborn baby.

My Thoughts:

 Each character in Mothers Day is truly dynamic throughout their first scenes until their demise or survival. Even supporting characters such as Gina and Lydia switch their motives a few times throughout the film. Lydia is so flimsy during the last half of the film that you truly believe shes going to fall for Georges bait-and-switch. However, her Mother has truly instilled that men are absolutely evil and Lydia remains loyal to her family. If I was in Lydias shoes, I probably wouldve done the same thing. It was either continue to be a criminal or life in prison- jeez, don't judge me.

 Beth, as the main protagonist, does make you root for her and allows you into the mind of her decisions. She was hiding the (small amount of) money to give herself and her pregnant belly some sort of foundation when she planned on leaving her cheating husband. As much as she fights back, she insists on making stupid decisions. She couldve easily killed Ike in Treshawns office. The true standout as to who made all the correct decisions and who definitely wouldve survived (and did) is Annette! She stood as an intelligent, strong, young woman who is clearly on the outs with most of the party guests and primarily seen as the entertainment (rather than Julie who was a plane outcast). Annette listened to the words Mother Koffin told her and survived. And, when you watch the film, youll know one of the first lines Mother tells to the party guests is if everyone does as their told, nobody will be killed. Annette even went along with being sexually assaulted, knowing she was still protected. She played her role perfectly and you are emotional for her when she reunites with Beth in the end, knowing theyve both survived.

 I love Mothers Day and try to show it off to everyone I know! I love the great B-List cast, especially Rebecca De Morray who absolutely chews every part of scenery and you really do listen to her! She was absolutely flawless from start to finish. Any film with Jaime King, Shawn Ashmore, and Deborah Ann Woll are always worth a try. Unknowingly, Patrick Flueger is also in this film Im reviewing, compared to his good-guy character in Kill Theory. This type of horror doesnt have the slashes and close the door to see someone there, but it delivers in stating the true horror: your friends. Mother Koffin uses the friends battered relationships to turn them on one another. I am terrified by home invasions because sometimes you have to examine those objects around you; just in case. Always have a plan! The director, Darren Lynn Bousman, is so consistent with great horror films and I especially love how he portrays his female characters: as strong, independent thinkers who will fight back. This movie makes you root for its heroes and pricks at your anxiety. But, wait, would you be mad at Beth for not admitting to having the money in the first place? Hmm.",1428969600,,13126,4.748684210526315

This review is from: Mother's Day (DVD)
Going into the remake of Mothers Day, I was a bit apprehensive. The original, while fun, is hardly a classic and I was afraid they were going to play up this remake with every camp value that most horror fans love in the original. It was to both my delight and my shock that this remake is played deadly straight. Whatever comedy here is of the blackest kind and dark comedy fans will be delighted.

Mothers Day is one of the craziest, most messed up suspense horrors that Ive seen in a while and this is coming from a guy who watched Human Centipede II less than a week ago. The kills are quite extreme. Wanna see a girl shot in the face in extreme close up? Its here. The film may be nearly two hours long but not a single scene seemed the slightest bit padded. The performances are all around excellent with special acclaim due to Rebecca De Mornay who is perfect in the role as the cunningly evil mother. She could have played this role over-the-top but not a single bit of her performance feels mannered or theatrical. She plays this as a real mother. A real psycho mother, yes, but a real mother none-the-less.",1427932800,,1264,4.401709401709402

This is easily among the most gore filled fun fests I've ever witnessed.  This is the kind of movie my mom used to say was NOT Good For Me!  I mean it for real, this Movie is Psychopath \ Sociopath 301 the advanced course.  The mom was sick.  Her boys were sick sadistic hopelessly twisted morons but, I liked them.

The violence and gore in this DVD had me crawling in my seat and generally I have a strong constitution.  I was squirming in my seat because; the violence in Mothers Day was gratifying on levels only my psychiatrist truly understands.  This is not a movie for young minds.  This is the ultimate Wolf among the sheeple film.  The propduction values had that movie of the week feel but, that said the movie rocked.  There were plenty of plot twists and turns.  The ending is kind of what you would expect for its type.

Honestly for the price Mothers Day can't be beat. Video quality 9.1 out of ten sometimes things were out of focus.  Audio 8,5 out of ten sometimes the voices and sound faded out without warning or explanation.  Mothers Day was at once funny and horrific.",1416182400,2,1255,4.344827586206897

But if you want something with a good script - please do not watch this film!

The characters are complete imbeciles! It's a home invasion film; there are TWO MEN (with guns, sure...but); there are TEN people in the house, and on multiple occasions they could have very easily overpowered the invaders - instead they go through torture for the whole film.

This one was boring. I felt like it was on forever and kept wanting it to end already. Not a good sign. The production values were good, though there wasn't anything special to it. The acting was adequate, and again nothing to write home about. There was a lot of ""action"", i.e. screaming, dying, brouhaha, but it failed to make an impression on me. I wasn't even interested in any of the characters in it, not on the protag side or the antag side, which given how many there were (though some of them hardly had any dialogue and were just filler) is actually an impressive feat, though not a good one.

For the real mother's day fans, there are some real snaky references to the original snuck in here all over the place, and for non-fans, this will play just fine.  This is an above-average intruders type film that sees a bunch of young adults being held captive by a wicked mother and her two deviant sons.  The movie does not get real messy and disgusting like the original, but - it does get a bit more hardcore in it's last stretch than you would think, and besides a needlessly weird explanation of the house/money/kidnapping storyline (the less said the better) this film carves out its own identity albeit it's not anything that will stick with you like the original - it's very well made and occasionally jolting.  Extras are mininal but it does include a nice commentary track from the director that you have to find in AUDIO because it's hidden on the disc itself.  A feature explaining the original to the new film would've been nice, but nothing like that to be found here.  The blu-ray image and sound are excellent.",1378598400,3,1169,4.511848341232228

4596935,5,B0057JIR0Y,"""Mother's Day"" is a movie I would love to have watched in certain NYC theaters where the patrons loudly shout their support for the good guys and scream curses at the villians.
In this totally enjoyable suspenser, you're given a gallery of some of the meanest villians to be seen on the screen in years--led by the deliciously evil Rebecca De Mornay.
We watch and cringe as this version of Ma Barker and her family torture a group of ""goodies"" with such obvious enjoyment that your cringes turn into gasps.
There are no heroes in this fun entertainment directed by Daron Lynn Bousman. The captured men and women do everything wrong. They're given chances to escape but fail to do so. We never know who will be killed or tortured next.
You sit on the edge of your seat awaiting the next burst of unexpected violence and it comes out of nowhere.
""Mother"" is an especially fascinating portrait of evil since the actress appears to be a well-groomed matron or executive from Wall Street. With her perfectly coiffed hair, pearls, business attire, her wickedness shocks.
She can merely nod at one of her psycho sons in the direction of one of the good people who've displeased her, and we watch the poor woman have her hair set on fire--or watch in horror as an innocent man is scalded with boiling water.
This movie has first-rate production values, camerawork, editing, and great stunt work from a small army of hearty souls.
I kept seeing Rebecca De Mornay as Margaret White--the whacko mother of Carrie White in the horror classic, CARRIE.
In this movie, our mother is as slinky and deadly as a Queen Cobra.",1365897600,2,1605,4.6749116607773855

4596937,5,B0057JIR0Y,"Money is the root of all evil, and this movie totally proves it.

While I've never seen the original, you know quite frankly it doesn't even *matter*.  Mother's Day is an EXTREMELY violent, mentally disturbing, emotional roller coaster ride of excitement, confusion, suspense, and just about everything else you can throw on the table.  It's about a group of violent brothers (and their mother) that return to their old home in an attempt to obtain lots of money that's been mailed to that address.  However, when they arrive they quickly realize that new owners have moved in.  Considering how violent these brothers are, you can probably guess what happens- they threaten the new owners -as well as the new owners many friends who happen to drop by for a party they'll never forget- to hand over the money that the brothers and mother strongly believe they're hiding somewhere in the house.  After all, the money was shipped to that address.  *Someone* has to have it!  You'll find out through the many twists and turns what makes money such a vicious thing.

Let's mention the storyline since it's probably one of the most brutal and graphic I've ever seen.  It's comparable to the Hills Have Eyes.  Remember that segment in the Hills Have Eyes when a mother gets shot in graphic fashion with all the trademark screaming and blood squirting?  Expect several moments in Mother's Day that are as equally disturbing, trust me.  However, Mother's Day takes it a step further.  Guess what THESE bad guys do?  They threaten their victims by playing games with them.  What happens when one man doesn't listen?  Why, he has scolding hot water poured into his ears as he screams and loses his hearing.  It's only fair since he didn't do what he was told, right?  He didn't do what mother wanted!  Follow the rules and everything will go accordingly.

What happens when a woman begs for her life but is unable to defend herself because she's tied up?  She has her head set on fire with the burn marks plainly, painfully and disturbingly visible to us.  She can't even comfort her head because her arms are tied.  Meanwhile her friends who are tied up RIGHT NEXT to her have to see this happen and worry that the fire might carry over onto them.  This is what mother wanted.  How about a gunshot directly to the back of the head when a girl tries to run away from one of the crazy gun-shooting brothers so half of her head is blown apart before our very eyes?  The timing of THIS one shocked me pretty good.  In fact the timing overall is pretty spectacular and unpredictable, really adding to the suspense factor.  I could go on and on naming several other horrific moments that involve torture but this is good enough.  A certain sexual-related scene is pretty warped too- I'm not really referring to the act itself but what the bad guys do to determine which woman has to go through with the sex.  It's really crazy.

This kind of stuff shows just how vicious and animal-like people can be and will certainly make you question God's existence.  The storyline proves that it's too easy to turn into a total monster whenever you become angry and crazy enough and nothing can stop it from happening.

The mother however (played by Rebecca De Mornay) CLEARLY stands out as the best character.  Pretending to be nice and innocent and protective of her boys only to have a demented side that firmly believes those that refuse to follow the rules have to suffer the consequences makes Mother's Day such a thrilling experience.  She defends her sons constantly but does so in an abnormal way.

Time and time again I do feel that the brothers were probably too polite towards the blonde-haired woman, who the one brother drives to the bank to withdraw enough cash.  This is to allow the brothers and their mother to be on their way with enough money in their possession.  This leads to the best segment in the film- when the one brother forces two girls to decide who's going to kill the other so one of them can live, and if they don't make a decision in 30 seconds he'll shoot both of them anyway leading to several ""PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!"" screams and tears by the girls.  Yes it's *this* kind of movie!

Mother's Day is completely 100% SICK.  If you're easily offended by how twisted and cruel people can be when they have nothing to lose, this movie is NOT for you.  For the horror and suspense fans that enjoy a neverending thrilling ride, this *is* for you.  Just remember, money is the root of all evil and you'll see that this old expression has more meaning than simply the demented mother and her sons trying to obtain all the money that they feel is theirs.  The storyline goes even deeper despite simply featuring one violent act after another, which is a remarkable feat really.  What a film.",1363478400,,4791,4.609929078014185
4596938,5,B0057JIR0Y,"This movie had me yelling at the screen, yelling at the characters and the suspense was just killing me. Rebecca plays these parts well.

4596940,4,B0057JIR0Y,"Mama's boys have really done it this time... After a botched bank robbery, they return home to find that mama's been evicted, and that all of the money they've been sending home has mysteriously disappeared. Unfortunately for the new owners and their party guests, that means that they have just become hostages to a crazed family and their keen but equally insane mother! Rebecca De Mornay stars in Darren Lynn Bousman's sleek restyling of the cult classic MOTHER'S DAY, which takes us back to the early days of Exploitation with its raw violence and ruthless characters. What begins as a generic thriller quickly escalates into an all-out nightmare that explodes with many unexpected moments of bloody carnage. Bousman keeps with the dark satire of the original in portraying the average American family turned upside down, whose corrupted sense of morality leads to death and destruction. Rebecca De Mornay is perfectly cast as Mother Koffin, bringing power and authority to the role along with a sadistic sense of humor. MOTHER'S DAY is a surprise hit that flows from the same vein of trash cinema as THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.

4596943,5,B0057JIR0Y,"I saw the original TROMA version of MOTHER'S DAY at the drive-in, where it was meant to be seen. It was a grimy, slimy movie about abduction, torture, and rape via inbred hillbilly-types. The MOTHER was an old hag w/ an extremely twisted sense of family. The remake is quite different. It's a home-invasion story, w/ a family of bank robbers on the run. This time, the MOTHER role is played by the incredible Rebecca De Mornay (THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, IDENTITY). She is the blackened heart and sickened soul of this film. Ms. De Mornay is riveting, as she seethes w/ pent-up rage and eeevil, while still managing to give off a deceiving sense of restraint. Her performance appears effortless and genuine. My one thought while watching was: ""Why doesn't she do more horror movies?"" As for her family, well, they're a homicidal mess. The offspring in this update are more deeply-damaged psychopaths than knuckle-dragging hicks. The victims of the story are unsuspecting, upper middle class folks. They're just having fun at a party when the terror begins. Jaime King (THEY WAIT, THE TRIPPER) plays one of the besieged homeowners, suddenly plunged into survival mode. The overall atmosphere of the movie reminded me of the remakes of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, both of which I liked more than the originals. MOTHER'S DAY is suspenseful, and manages to shock without being as overtly vile as the original. I loved every minute of it!...",1357344000,,1462,4.805555555555555

It makes the movie drag on, and seem completely unrealistic. Also, the original had a surprise ending, this one doesn't, just leaves things in a totally predictable way.

4596949,4,B0057JIR0Y,"I'm gonna' go out on a limb here and say maaaybe you shouldn't sit down with mom to watch this on Mother's Day.  But you should watch it!  This home invasion flick yields more action than one could have ever imagined given the premise.  Not only that, but the action often involves chicks doing hardcore tough physical things under believable circumstances including a surprisingly long fight scene with 51-year old Rebecca De Mornay!

The Koffin family is a mean one.  When a bank job goes wrong, the three Koffin boys flee to what was their mother's home.  Only, the house was foreclosed and the new owners are having a friendly gathering when the Koffin boys bust in, panicked, and one (Johnny Koffin) is seriously injured.  Daniel and Beth are the hosting couple and they have six guests.

The brothers call mother and when she arrives we learn that she is a loving, civil, polite sociopath who provided her boys with their criminal skill set.  We not only learn that, but that stolen money that the boys were sending mother from previous jobs clearly never made it to her...but the new owners don't seem to know anything about it.

As this story of domestic attrition progresses, tension increases on many levels.  As Johnny Koffin's injury advances Mother Koffin becomes less intolerant and her boys more temperamental.  While on a ""field trip"" with one of the Koffin's Beth has difficulty finding enough money to meet their demands.  The party guests are pit against one another under plausible circumstances--and the guests find reasons to turn against each other on their own and it's not handled politely.  George (Shawn Ashmore) gets caught revealing Mother Koffin's manipulations to Lydia, who gradually finds George's claims more credible.  And Mother Koffin finds it ever less plausible that the party hosts don't know anything about the money as she discovers Daniel's capacity for lying.

The brutality in this film is immediate!  Johnny Koffin's horrible wound is tended, bones are gruelingly crushed, and chunks of flesh palatably slap about.

The players include the hosting couple is Daniel (Frank Grillo; Warrior, The Grey) and Beth (Jaime King; Silent Night, My Bloody Valentine).  Beth is credibly horrified, serially fragile, and occasionally strong.  Their house guests include Shawn Ashmore (the X-Men trilogy), Briana Evigan (The Devil's Carnival, Sorority Row) as a refined punkster, Kandyse McClure (Children of the Corn, Carrie), and Jessie Rusu (The Tortured, Saw VI).

Mother Koffin (Rebecca De Mornay; Apartment 1303 3D, Identity) is cold, calculating, and evidently went to charm school.  She won't steal an engagement ring that was a family heirloom, but she won't flinch as horrible physical deeds are conducted before their eyes.  But she is not without her own frailty when it comes to seeing her family safely moved from harm's way.  Her boys are brutal but fearful.  The submissive Lydia Koffin (Deborah Ann Woll; True Blood) takes orders without questions.  She seems sweet and out of place, but her obedience is apparent.

In the end, the friends attempt to look past their newfound hostilities to work together and escape.  But have they been through too much for that little dream to come true?  Could the Koffins simply that little encountered evil that always seems to win?

You'll have to watch to find out and I do consider it worth the watch.

)1- I hate the ending (can't tell you why-spoilers you know;
)2. I don't like the movie's inference that Ma Coffin and her brood are no worse than their hostages - can't buy that one!
)3.  I find the victims' lack of action hard to accept since they outnumber their captors and have several responsive opportunities.
With that out of the way, MOTHER'S DAY is a visceral experience--brutal, violent, sadistic and intense.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  Directed with an unrelenting ferocity by Darren Bousman (of SAW fame), the movie careens to its violent climax.
An excellent cast delivers dynamite performances:  Rebecca DeMornay (HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL) is chilling indeed as Mama, sometimes a June Cleaver doling out birthday cake and transforming into a Joan Crawford wielding a bloody coat-hanger.  Her offspring are psychotic effigies, especially Patrick Flugel (THE 44), Warren Kole (TV's COMMON LAW) and TRUE BLOOD's waifish Deborah Ann Woll.  Frank Grillo (THE GREY) and Jaime King (MY BLOODY VALENTINE) do well as the focal couple while eternally doomed Shawn Ashmore (THE DIVIDE) is good as the young doctor called on to save the wounded robber psycho.

4596962,2,B0057JIR0Y,"The film starts with a bang, as unknown perpetrators invade a hospital and steal a new born baby from the nursery. From there, the movie fast forwards a couple of decades to the home of a young couple in the midst of throwing a shindig. The party proves to be a success. That is, until three young men on the lamb, due to a foiled bank heist, head there because it used to be their home. The men enter the home and chaos ensues. To make matters worse, one of the brothers is severely wounded. Apparently their Momma lost the house and they had no way of contacting her because her son lost his phone. Yep... you read it correctly. The boys had been sending her cash for a very long time and she wasn't there to collect it (they couldn't write her a letter that they had lost said phone). So now, they want to know where the money went. This family is very good at losing things: their minds, home, phone and cash.

I'm not going to delve further into the story. The plot is ridiculous, a hackneyed script the relies too heavily on the motherly instinct gone awry premise. The characters are either selfish or boorishly stupid. Some of the errors in judgement are astronomically bad. Their is no subtlety in the human error, which gives the bad guys the upper hand. The movie takes unnecessary turns to prolong a story that should have finished upon Rebecca De Mornay's entrance and inquiry about the missing cash. The plot twist, or reason why it was prolonged is just plain silly. All the gore in the world is not going to save this film.

Acting wasn't atrocious, but it wasn't great either. Rebecca De Mornay over stays her welcome as the psychotic mother who is frosting a cake one minute and then citing proverbial quotes like ""no use crying over spilled milk,"" as a captive lies dead and bleeding on the floor.

The gore wasn't bad, if that's your thing. The body count runs high and some of the deaths are creative. Fans of splatterpunk and gorror should find something here to get their neurons spitting happy thoughts.

4596970,3,B0057JIR0Y,"Rebecca Demornay is terrific as a sadistic mother of a family of psychopaths in this re-imagining of the 1980 grindhouse cult classic of the same name. The story doesn't stay very faithful to the original. In this, mama's sons are three bank robbers (Fleuger, Kole, O'Leary) on the run from the law who come ""home"" to hide out. What they don't know is mama lost the house a few months earlier to a foreclosure, and they just arrived while the new owners are throwing a party. Torture and mayhem follows, exposing dark secrets among the partygoers/hostages along the way. The film has some memorable moments for gorehounds and fans of new-age torture porn (especially the 'Saw' crowd) but becomes more and more like a violent crime thriller than a horror movie as it progresses. The acting is a definite plus, with relatively unknown actors giving strong performances that deserve praise.

Overall not a bad effort in the least. In fact, I would have given it 4 stars but the ending is a major disappointment, especially when compared to the notorious ""Queenie"" ending of the 1980 original.",1338681600,,1089,4.854838709677419

When Darren Lynn Bousman's retooling of ""Mother's Day"" landed on my front porch, I was interested in seeing what the man behind the first three ""Saw"" sequels and ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" did to the 1980 original.

If special features concern you when buying a movie, the ""Mother's Day"" Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack won't satisfy you.

It definitely falls in the horror genre though, which I think is a plus considering the stuff out there now posing as horror. The movie also had a touch of a psychological thriller too.

The plot is horrible (not sure if there even IS one) and the end is not fulfilling nor does it make any sense.

Rebecca De Mornay should have waited for a much better vehicle to try to make her entrance back into film.  Oh, and one more thing?  She looks just like Hillary Clinton and that creates an odd impression also of our secretary of state slashing and killing all the way through a movie.

The hostages angered me with their stupidity at times, but what do you expect from folks who still party with disco music.  Definately worth a watch for fans of the genre.

4596980,3,B0057JIR0Y,"I have to give this a 3 because:
Cons:
1.) I hate movies that are set up for a sequel.
2.) Some play given to secrets between lovers and friends and the psychological damage - but not enough to be considered a psychological thriller, and its hard to keep that in mind with the constant action.
3.) Drifts into dark comedy then slams you back into gore.
4.) I was not at all surprised by the ending - very Jasonesque.
Pros:
1.) Rebecca DeMorney is great - loved the typical 'Mom' lines with the sadistic twist.
2.) Jaime King was also very good.
3.) Innovative use of hand tools.
4.) The black guy didn't die first.

So, maybe a 2.5 would have been more accurate.  It's certainly action packed, though I didn't anything particularly startling with so-called plot twists.  If you like gore, the gore is quite well done even with the usual dim or back lighting.

It did leave me with a lingering question - Who in their right mind has that much saran wrap on hand?",1337644800,2,961,4.382022471910112

Bousmann did a nice job with directing this insane thriller, and Ms. Mornay did a good job as a psychotic mother, in fact she steals, chews and eats the screen from her first scene to the chilling conclusion. On that note, is this film worth owning? Well, once again, that depends on your point of view. But for me, I viewed the case at my local fye and was instantly intrigued-so I reserved it, so, in a word, yes! Would SAW fans enjoy it? Honestly, I don't know, maybe. All I can do is give my opinion and hope some people read/watch and agree. Some of the death scenes reminded me of some of the SAW traps, so judge for yourself.

4596982,2,B0057JIR0Y,"Positives:
(1.) Well acted; almost too well acted such that I have to wonder about the actors. Certainly don't want them as neighbors.
(2.) Creative gruesome behaviors. Perhaps a little too sick for a healthy mind.
(3.) Nice flow to the story so kudos to the director and writers for that part.
(4.) Reminded me of the Hong Kong movie ""Dream Home""; the movie ""Neighbors"" and another ""mom with dysfunctional, not so nice, kids"" movie from a couple years back but, sorry,  can't remember it's title.

Negatives:
(1.) Usual dumb decisions by cops, and hostages too numerable to mention. Writers can be a bit more creative than that! Example: Survivor, in hospital, gives address of crime scene to hospital staff and only fire trucks show up hours later and to attend to a fire.
(2.) Way too predictable ending that some bad people survive to carry on with their child abductions and probable future crime activities.",1337558400,,913,4.846153846153846
4596983,4,B0057JIR0Y,"Rebecca DeMorney steals this show. Some reviewers here and elsewhere are expecting too much of this movie. If you want ""high brow"" sensibilities and cinematic perfection, look elsewhere. This is an A+ B-Movie, however, so to speak. The violence was creative, and pretty disturbing. I watched about 15 minuutes of SAW 1 and had to turn it off because it was too intense and gross for me. (This flick is lovingly offered by the Director of a few of the SAW movies, so  expect some scary stuff. The only two likable characters here are the criminal family's mind-controlled daughter, who, with the help of the hostage-doctor, begins to see that her life was a lie created by ""Mother"". As for the rest of the cast, the hostages are pretty venial, refusing to cooperate to defeat the decidedly dysfuntional demonic family. I had no interest in the fate of them, ,save for the aforementioned doctor, who revels all the secrets which need to be revealed. Who lives and who dies is pretty irrelevant here; the fight scenes are great and crappy, even if one hopes both combatants lose. There is avery strong anti-yuppie thread through the proceedings, so if you swill Starbucks coffee and really care about how your coworkers will be intimidated by your overpriced wannabe luxury car, be prepared to be insulted. The main fun here is hating ""Mother"" and witnessing her descent into a June Cleaver-but-this-time-she's-insane meltdown. Deborah Ann Woll does a great job as Lydia, a modern day Squeaky Fromm who I still  found myself rooting for. She wants out of the family business, but doesn't know how far she's will to go to break free. So sit back, get yourself a caffeinated beverage, and join your special  someone and watch this often darkly amusing production. Veterans of the ultra-splatter genre may find this movie a tad tame, but for me, it had just enough nasty in it to make it more than worth the rental price.

4596984,5,B0057JIR0Y,"The original ""Mother's Day"" film was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Troma's Lloyd Kaufman, and released in the early 1980's in the middle of the slasher movie craze.  It was wild, intense, gory, and included some very silly humor.  I saw it on cable tv in 1983 on the night before Mother's Day and it scared the heck out of me when Queenie made her appearance at the end of the film.  The 2010 version of ""Mother's Day"" is a reimagining of the orignal film.  In a nod to the original film, there are a few references to Queenie.  However, that is where the similarities end.  Rebecca de Mornay plays the mother character in this movie and she owns every scene she is in through out the entire film.  She is by turns motherly and caring and sadistic and brutal.  She rules her family with an iron grip.  You can read the synopsis of the film on the Amazon web site so I won't go into details.  I will say this movie is very brutal, graphic, and intense.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.  In a review of the film, Rue Morgue Magazine said that the movie was so good it should have been released in the theaters instead of dumped on DVD without a theatrical screening.  I wholeheartedly agree.  This movie deserves much better.",1337472000,10,1250,4.378260869565217
4596985,1,B0057JIR0Y,"I encourage everybody to check this flick out, as all my horror buds seem to love it.  I for one had to call the horror plumber, as it severely clogged up my mental pipes.  Seriously I had to flush this gigantic piece of poop far, far away.  The Mother's Day stench still permeates my room like a baby squatting in month old diapers.

Now let me say I love silly low budget horror flicks.  Pretty much anything from Troma or the like I totally dig, or at least can appreciate the efforts of the independent filmmaker.  This one does have great production values plus a talented cast.  Not to mention Rebecca DeMornay seems to be aging like Benjamin Buttons--looking better than ever.  I'm curious why she agreed to this flick though, I guess casting calls have sadly been few and far between.

Anyway, this is a home invasion flick.  Super scary premise.  It's the kind of serious subject matter that perhaps requires a certain director to pull off.  As I watched this movie start to unfold, I began to get the same feeling I got when watching Die Hard 4.  Not because of some over the top action scenes, but because of developments that defy all logic.  I can handle a few miscues plus I can leap over some plot holes, but c'mon!  Groan after groan after head shaking followed by unintentional laughter...this became an unbearable chore for me to sit through.  Nonsensical dialogue and character reactions coupled with straight up preposterous unbelievable situations...ARGGHH!  I was crying for my mommy.

Mother's Day does have a nice pace to go with the solid acting and good production values.  There are a couple halfway decent violent moments but nothing too graphic.  This movie appeals to many viewers, but I'm definitely not one of them.  If you're looking for a suspenseful, believable home invasion flick, I highly recommend you checkout Kidnapped.",1337126400,3,1860,4.786163522012578

4596987,1,B0057JIR0Y,"When I first saw the original MOTHER'S DAY back in the eighties I was conflicted. I found it to be disturbing, vulgar, and gross and yet original and a low budget film that you found yourself forced to watch through to the end and remembering. The remake of that film has none of those attributes.

This time around we start with a group of friends christening the new house a young couple has bought. It's obvious that the woman in question isn't quite sure how she feels, but we have no idea why yet. The oddest thing about this gathering is how different each couple seems; as if there is no way that these couples would be friends in real life.

The second half of the story revolves around a trio of bank robbers, one of which has been badly wounded during their last heist. Unsure of where to go to escape the net the police have cast to catch them as well as an upcoming hurricane, they head to the safest place they know, their mother's house. The problem is that the house was foreclosed on months before and they haven't kept in touch with their mother to know this.

After walking into the house, they confront the couples there and recruit one, who happens to be a doctor, to take care of their brother. Only then do they call their mother on an unsecured line to find out what happened. While waiting for her arrival, they try to figure out to do. The most volatile of the bunch terrorizes the couples in the basement while the smart on attempts to make a plan.

Mother shows with their sister in a motor home, their new place to live. It turns out that the special phone she gave them was lost a while back which is why they had no idea what happened. She tries to calm down the couples in the basement and reprimands her boys for their behavior. She seems to be the calm one of the family.

But that changes. When they tell her they've been sending her money to this location, she begins asking the new home owners what they did with the money. Both tell her that they never received any packages but she doesn't believe them. She sends the oldest boy out with the woman of the house along with the debit cards of each person there to get money. To escape the country they'll need $10,000. While they're gone, she tries to find the answers as to where the money went.

As the story unfolds, the couples begin to turn on each other. Some want to make an attempt to escape, others want to take on the bad guys while a third group just wants to play along with whatever they want. Degradation and torture follow (not nearly as has happened in worse films of this sort) and solutions aren't forthcoming. Just who will survive the night remains to be seen.

If you've seen the original film you'll notice tons of changes, the setting being the first. Gone are the two redneck killers from the original to be replaced with three bank robbers. Mother isn't an elderly woman being replaced here by Rebecca DeMornay. Hurricane? Where did that come from? Stolen money? Couples?

The original film, though brutal for the time, focused on three friends camping who are captured by two redneck brothers who are encouraged by their mother. It was a story of survival. It took place in the deep back woods in rural America. The only thing this film has in common with the original is death by Drano and an impaled crotch.

I have yet to understand why folks who love a film feel the need to revamp it to make it something different. If you loved it, why change it so much? Then again the real reason is easy. It's easy to cash in or get financing when you have a known commodity to help draw people into a theater or to purchase a movie. Unfortunately to date no remake has lived up to the original and this film is proof of that. Which is saying a lot since the original was one of the first films brought to you by the folks at Troma, a company that makes a point of miniscule budgets and plenty of over the top gore. Don't bother with the remake and seek out the original if you're looking for a real horror film. This one only hopes you won't know what the first one was like.",1336953600,6,4080,4.336828309305374

Her 3 boys on the lam from robbing a bank, broke in what they thought was their house.  It was foreclosed on and had new owner's and the 3 brothers, one of which had been shot, had no idea there were other owners living there now. The new owners were having a party in the basement and lets just say that the brothers crashed their party.

4596989,5,B0057JIR0Y,"I'm a horror obsesso. I love anything from Fulci/Argento flicks, to 80's slashers and bizarre euro cult trash, as well as newer horror films like Inside, the FIRST Saw and the FIRST Hostel. I liked the original Mother's Day alright, though as far as classic slashers go, it was marginally low on the list. Still, I wanted to see this because Rebecca De Mornay played Mother and it was directed by Darren Bousman - a fine director who has shown his merits on films like Repo The Genetic Opera.

Guess What? This film delivers it all. Action, horror, drama, suspense, gore, torture, plot twists - all of the highest pedigree. This film is a good example of when remakes work. The original was very violent and crazy in that 80's way, but it was not suspensful and was predictable (by 1983 the formula was well established). The new version of Mother's Day is very well written. Mother, Ike, & Addley are all present, along with two younger new siblings (one of whom you will recognize from a certain sultry show), as well as nods to Queenie a few times. :)

I will say, I thought I had seen it all (and I pretty much have), but its nice to occasionally have a film that has all the right elements come together. By the end of this movie, I was on the edge of my seat and thats what a well crafted horror film should do.

4596994,4,B0057JIR0Y,"Being a fan of the original Troma version of this remake I didn't know how they could possibly re edit this keeping it somewhat true to the original yet bringing it up to date.
They managed to keep the story somewhat in tact such as keeping the main characters names the same they even mentioned Queenie a few times.
This time around they added a daughter played by the beautiful Deborah Ann Woll who also plays Jessica on True Blood' Her character is confused and timid and more emotionally vulnerable than her brothers Ike Addley and Johnny. They added some Family drama and treachery to the victims as well which played perfectly into the plot of this story.

Rebecca DeMornay was amazing as Mother and spoke a few lines that were a direct homage to The Hand That Rocks The Cradle such as 'You cant take care of your child ,you can't even keep your man'.The acting was good overall and it was a non stop bloody thrill ride.

It wasn't a splatterfest like I had heard but it is certainly violent and there are some very graphic scenes and a couple of splatters.
There was one death scene in particular that stayed very true to the original. I'm speaking of the drain cleaner and television set...I have no clue why this wasn't in theaters because I can envision people in the audience rooting for the hero or heroine or heroes or heroines to do to Mother what The Herione did to DeMornay's Character, Peyton Flanders in The hand That Rocks The Cradle. It's the best movie of this type I have seen in quite awhile.
I bought the Blu ray and am watching it again today.",1336608000,5,1568,4.45993031358885
8460841,5,B0057JIR0Y,"Learning that this was a remake of a 1980 horror film of the same name, I decided that for Mother's Day I would, obviously, check out Mother's Day. Now, from what I've heard, this movie and the one from 1980 are two totally different movies. The 1980 version is more of a backwoods horror I Spit On Your Grave while this one was just an intense home invasion with a plethora of gory, gruesome, intense, and disturbing kills. Going into this I was a bit weary of its nearly 2-hour runtime (sans credits the movie runs about an hour and forty-five minutes long), but once the fun got started about ten minutes in, I knew that the next hour and a half would be an intense ride. Everyone in the movie gives a fantastic performance, specifically Jaime King and Rebecca de Mornay. Rebecca de Mornay is fantastic as the Mother, and Jaime King gives a performance here that further cements her title of scream queen. And how good was Briana Evigan?! I loved her in Sorority Row, and she's such a beautiful woman. Jaime King's character and Briana Evigan's character were essentially the only two of the protagonists I was actually rooting for. My verdict? Check it out. Despite its rather long runtime, it feels a lot shorter than it is, feeling more like 90 minutes instead of 112. You will NOT be disappointed.",1526169600,,1304,4.576923076923077
