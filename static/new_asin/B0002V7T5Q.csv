The Lion King is a much beloved Disney classic. And while the Lion King 1  and 2 are not nearly as good as the original - they are funny and enjoyable in their own right.

The special features, frankly, are not that good.  There's some games on them and some short montages on the characters.  But mostly, I just watched the movies.",1105660800,49,502,4.511111111111111
2123144,5,B0002V7T5Q,"(This review is for the films only.)

Yes, I said trilogy. This set includes the Disney classic The Lion King and its two sequels,The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1 1/2. All three are great films, which is surprising, due to Disney's history with doing sequels.

The Lion King is the classic story of a young lion club named Simba who is next in line to become king of the Pride Lands. As he gets older, his uncle Scar begins to despise him and Mufasa, Simba's father and Scar's older brother. Mufasa is king, which makes Scar furious, and he makes a plot to kill them both. The plot is proven to be a success. Mufasa is killed and Simba, believing it to be his fault, runs off. He leaves the Pridelands and meets Timon and Pumbaa, a meekat and warthog who eats bugs. Simba soon joins the two and adopts their ""Hakuna Matata""(it means no worries)lifestyle. Soon, Simba grows up and one day comes across his old friend Nala, who tells him that Scar is destroying their home. Simba at first disagrees about doing something about it, but after meeting with a old friend of his father named Rafiki, a wise mystic baboon, Simba gets back on track and decides to challenge Scar and become......The Lion King.

This movie is truly one of the best animated movies ever made. With some amazing voice-overs(including James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, Whoppi Goldberg, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and a engaging story, The Lion King is truly a classic to behold. Five Stars.

While probably the least interesting of the set, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride is still one amazing sequel. The story revolves around Simba's and Nala's daughter named Kiara. Kiara one days ventures into the territory of the lioness named Zira. Zira is the wife of Scar and she wants revenge on Simba. Zira has a young lion club named Kovu and while Kiara is in Zira's territory, she and Kovu get to know each other. Soon, the two parents show up and Simba takes Kiara home. At her home, Zira comes with a plan: she will train Kovu to kill Simba by getting to Kiara. Years later, they are now grown up and while Kiara is on her first hunt, a fire, set off by Zira's other children, is burning the pridelands. Kiara barely makes to high ground and Kovu arrives just in time to save her. Simba sees him and Kovu tells him to give him a chance, while truly trying to kill him. Meanwhile, Rafiki is trying to get Kiara and Kovu together, beliving it could stop the feud between the two families. It proves to be a success as Kiara and Kovu fall for each other. Soon Simba tries to get to know Kovu better and finds out the truth about Kovu plans for Simba, which Kovu now doesn't want to go through with, due to his feelings for Kiara. Kovu gets banished and Kiara runs off to find him. Zira now decides to take on Simba's pride by force and kill Simba by herself. Now, Kovu and Kiara must stop this before the worst happens.

Better than most sequels, Simba's Pride brings back all the characters from the original and introduces fascinating new characters. The story, while less interesting than the first, still works for this film and the voice-overs are good as well.

Four Stars.

The newest addition to the series is The Lion King 1 1/2. This is the first film's story, told from Timon's and Pumbaa's point of view. The story begins with Timon and his life before he took on his Hakuna Matata lifestyle. He makes tunnels for a living, but always screws them up. While Timon's mom beleves he just hasn't found his place yet in the clan, Timon, along with his Uncle Max and the other meekats, believe he is just a klutz and he isn't gonna get better anytime soon. Timon decides it's time to find the home of his dreams and sets off with his mother's permission. While on his quest, he meets Pumbaa and the two form a ""aquaintship"", which soon becomes a friendship. They soon find their dream home and everything seems perfect until one day they find Simba and decide to raise him until that fateday when Nala arrived. When they hear Simba has gone back to the Pridelands to become king, Timon and Pumbaa must now help Simba regain his right to become the rightful king of the Pridelands.

This one is incredibly funny and also, very clever. The idea of seeing the story from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view is delightful and the laughs are plenty. Overall, a new addition to the series that is fresh and fun. I give the Lion King 1 1/2 five stars.

I hope this review was helpful. I hope you enjoy this set of movies as much as I did.",1103673600,103,4537,4.450060168471721

The creator of this movie made it clear what family was. Family was the opposite of what you would think. Family was everyone else. Family was all the people who supported Simba after the death of his father. Family was all the other animals. While growing up Simba had the ideal family. A mother and a father who loved and cared deeply for him. His father instilled values and morals into him. He taught him how to be a man and how to be a leader. His fathers death taught him the importance of following directions and listening to those who were older than him. His fathers death helped him value the lives of everyone else around him. He appreciated all the lessons his father ever taught him and because of them he ended up being able to be a great leader for his land. All the people of his land were happy to have a great king again. After Mustafa died and the uncle ran the land, no one respected him. He wanted everyone to fear him; however, fear will not help you run a land. People shouldnt be scared of their leader they should want to come to their leader for help and advice.

I can't help but wonder if others are having problems because they keep writing they won't play in their DVD player. Yes there is a difference! All the movies are very entertaining for kids and adults. The third movie is 'Lion King 1 1/2' I know it says it's 'Lion King 3' it's not a new movie, it's just 'Lion King 1 1/2' with the wrong title name. Not a big deal to me since I was just expecting the original three movies, but it you're hoping for a new Lion King movie you will be disappointed. The price is outstanding!

It still has the same voice actors, bonus content (there's bonus content specific to each movie on each disc), and played just fine on my PS3 (which is the U.S. version of the console). However, it does not come with digital copies or DVD discs like some of the other Disney blu-ray collections out there (which is partly why this is less expensive), so you will not get Disney Movie Reward points for the purchase. All of the movies are of superior production quality, including the sequels which feature the same voice actors as the first.

Overall, it's a great buy and totally worth the price of all three movies, especially considering you can't get the U.S. version of the Lion King since it is in the Disney vault.",1476316800,2,781,4.5

At this point, I am only telling you how the Blu-Ray is as if you are looking to buy this it is because you already have seen them and want to add them to your collection.  For a few bucks more, you can get all 3, worthwhile if you want to change up what you are watching with your little one.",1467072000,,613,3.9193548387096775

This DVD set was BRILLIANT. It included all 3 lion king movies, which are very hard to find nowadays, for a really good price (at the time of purchase it was $35). We were debating purchasing these, and I'm glad we decided to. The title states that the DVDs are UK import, so we feared it wouldn't work on our US DVD player. However, they worked brilliantly with a full-screen picture and high-definition. These are ALL REGION DVDs! that means they work in all regions, despite being from the UK. We received exactly what was pictured, 3 DVDs in their cases, despite what others are saying about receiving the DVDs loose, and they came in that box to help keep them together.
As for the movies, they were all brilliant movies worth watching. One thing I LOVED about these were the special features that came with the original Lion King movie. It included these AWESOME bloopers that were funny to watch and the option to play the movie in song-along mode, which was amazing.
So, if you are thinking about purchasing these, don't let the UK import steer you away, they work in ALL REGIONS as far as I am aware, since the DVD cases say all region on them, and DEFINITELY work on a US Blu-Ray player.",1456531200,49,1474,4.45925925925926

All discs played great in our Xbox One and the bonus features worked as well. We only played it in English so I can't testify if the other languages work but I'd assume they do since we had no issues with any other feature. The picture quality was great too.
People need to remember that Blu Ray discs will NOT work in a regular DVD player. That is the only reason I can see so many people having an issue.",1445385600,5,502,4.13265306122449

They have memorized the songs in the movie an act out scenes. It's been a positive movie for both of them. A big plus for my daughter who has time to get things done around the house.

When I found it I just grabbed it as quickly as I could, i was willing to pay a leg and an arm for any Lion King set! And you have no idea the huge smile I had on my face, it felt like I was 5 again!

It has been almost 20 years since The Lion King has been out, and I still love it to death! I actually just finished watching it again tonight and sang along with all the songs! :D

Even though I would've loved a better case for the discs, I am still happy for the set, whenever they release another set, I will be there again!!! I don't even care if I already have this one!

Have watched all 3 movies on blu-ray, and you can tell the difference between the blu-ray and regular dvd copies. My only complaint about the entire thing is that the holder the discs all come in seems to have somehow damaged every single disc in it, including the blu-ray, which are notoriously hard to scratch. The discs were kept safe, and even after a move they were fine. No clue how it happened, but as they now will only work if we get them resurfaced, I have to say that it was a sad day. Even with that though, still worth the price, and till worth 4/5 stars. Recommend putting all discs in proper cases/covers if you buy this though, to be safe.",1374278400,,749,4.28169014084507

2124156,5,B0002V7T5Q,"In response to the comments on the paper thin cardboard file type holders that actually hold the discs inside the drum, take it from someone who has over 750 Blu Rays and 20,000 DVDs. Blu Rays are VERY HARD to scratch. Unless you have some kind of physical defect that would affect the way you handle the discs, or you use them as Frisbees in a concrete parking lot. Anyone who would let small children handle, and insert discs are just asking for trouble. Some people think their children can do no wrong. If they can handle the discs, insert, remove, get messy hands all over the discs, and put back into a case without damaging the discs, then they should be able to put them back into a paper file type sleeve as well. The damage occurs while the discs are OUT of their respective holders. As long as you exercise a little care when handling the discs they should last a very long time. If you think that having Blu Ray disc cases would help, you need some counseling. I just got mine, and I love it as a COLLECTOR'S ITEM. I think some people are forgetting that. If you want to view these constantly over and over again, then get the 3 discs or the box set available on Amazon as well.",1365206400,5,1190,4.293333333333333

2124168,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I absolutely loveeee Lion King specially Lion King Part I and Lion King 1 1/2. The movie contains important lessons such as  believing in oneself (Simba and Rafiki who taught him that when Mufasa died); how Timon and Pumba stuck with Simba all the way because their friendship became strong, among others.  My husband also likes the movies and is dying to watch Lion King 1 1/2. We are building a movie collection for our 9 month old son and our baby girl who is on her way ;) We love blu and 3D movies...the image is very sharp and bright!!

The display case has beautiful artwork and the movies are placed securely within the drum for storage. The item was shipped in great packaging. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase.,1344211200,,329,4.593220338983051
2124177,4,B0002V7T5Q,"I too love the movie and Lion King is one of the classics right up there with Snow White, Cinderella, and Fantasia etc.  I miss The Morning Report integrated on the 3D BD , or the 2D BD, it isn't integrated into either movie for big bucks I paid for the Bluray set I expect the option of seeing the ""Special Edition"" version of the Bluray.  In the description where they laid out what you will be getting with each version, they stated that The Lion King Trilogy (Eight-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) would include the Special Edition of the film.  Another bone I have to pick about the set is the ridiculous packaging.  I thought Disney was all about being green.  The packaging includes: An oversized box, the movie specification on a slipcover, when you take the slipcover off you discover a cardboard African (I assume) drum, then you separate the drum and in the middle of all of this wasted materials is your Bluray discs all in cardboard accordion style case about the size of the disc,  save the squared bottom.  They could have (I really wish I got a choice) offered a thick case like the Die Hard Collection [Blu-ray] or The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration. Or they could have gone with a proper box-set, like they did with the box set that was released before POTC: On Stranger Tides. Just a straight forward 3 Standard Blurays with a slip cover.  Simple same hight as most the rest of blurays currently being sold.  The big box is ugly and takes up too much room.  They did another silly case for the Pirates of the Caribbean Four-Movie Collection.  I saved about $30 buying the trilogy and then the 3D version of POTC: On Stranger Tides.

And why since the Special Edition DVD release included new song ""Morning Report""? huh, you list it being there where is it?  It is buried on the 2D Disc bonus features.  Why oh why could they have just dropped it into the film like the previous DVD release, oh wait maybe they will be releasing a super duper collectors edition with it integrated into the film (BTW they could have easily done it with a software tweak, no need for a second disc).

As for the 3D I did not buy this collection for the 3D version of The Lion King.  I bought the bluray box-set when I had my old 2D Sony Bravia 46 inch LCD TV.  It went and died. So I purchased the massive 70"" 3D Sharp Aquos 240 hertz, but now after reviewing the movie it is hard to tell the difference between the 2 versions, just a chance to get more cash.  Good one on Disney for a crap substandard 2D to 3D conversion.  And I can tell you its not my setup.  I have a collection of other 3D blurays and the 3D is spectacular.  Save a tree avoid this box-set unless you must have 1 1/2 and 2 on bluray and just can't wait for Disney to release.",1341705600,,2774,4.316602316602316
2124178,5,B0002V7T5Q,"This great HD transfer for this trilogy. I already have it on DVD, but this BD it's superior. I love it, hope another likes too.",1335916800,,128,4.16
2124179,5,B0002V7T5Q,"The Lion King is one of those movies that will be timeless. Everyone has seen it and everyone wants their children to see it and you feel good showing it to them because of its wholesome nature. It has all of the different movies (with differing levels of quality as far as plot, but that's true of most sequals), a cool drum container that holds the dvds, and the box itself that looks like wood. It looks great in a collection or on a shelf. Highly recommended.",1335398400,,463,4.333333333333333
2124180,5,B0002V7T5Q,Packaging is gift quality without wrapping. The comment when the cardboard box arrived was 'IT'S CHRISTMAS!!'. The wooden storage case is very unique and pretty well dust proof.,1333756800,,177,5.357142857142857
2124181,2,B0002V7T5Q,"It is nice seeing a bundle package with all three Lion King movies included, but even with the current price incentive--50% off for a price of $49.99--I cannot convince myself to pull the trigger.

Strike 1: Based on the reviews & photos (of the package's contents) here & elsewhere on the Internet, I cannot fathom why Disney would package the discs in cardboard sleeves. These are, after all, kids movies. And anyone that has kids knows that these discs could very well be pulled out of & inserted into these sleeves hundreds of times over the course of time. If your kid(s) are well trained in careful disc handling, this will result in extra wear & tear on the discs' surfaces. I would have much rather seen some type of standard plastic tray for each disc. And given Disney's history of micromanaging their product lines, I am honestly disappointed with their decision here.

Strike 2: The only Lion King movie that currently has a Digital Copy disc is the first movie. This means that I have no choice but to bring the Lion King 1 1/2 & Lion King 2 discs along on road trips which easily translates to more wear & tear on the discs. Given the state of today's electronics this is almost unforgivable. It is not like it took Disney from The Lion King's release in 1994 until 2012 to pioneer new technology & encoding to present that movie in a Digital Copy format. In fact, I am willing to bet that in some double top secret room, there is a pristine copy of each film in its full digital glory. I will go just a little bit further to almost guarantee that if some Disney executive said, ""Give me a Digital Copy version of Lion King 1 1/2 & 2."" that some IT-type person could probably provide prototype discs for each movie within the hour...with time to spare. (Go re-read the last sentence under Strike 1.)

Strike 3: This one goes hand-in-hand with both of the previous strikes. Given the security encoded into Disney's DVDs, it is nigh impossible to ""rip"" these into video files like MPEG4 (.MP4), as an example. This makes them almost impossible to upload to a portable device like a tablet or back-up to a PC or NAS. By eliminating my ability to back-up the movies, or provide a digital copy that I can at least use on some select few portable devices, you leave us no choice but to carry around the source discs. I cannot help but feel like Disney is determined to help my kids destroy these discs. That way they (my kids) can pester me into buying yet another copy of the movies some time down the road...further lining Disney's proverbial pockets. Thanks. (Yes, that was sarcastic. And while you are here, go re-read the last sentence under Strike 1.)

Strike 4: The home market for 3D products is a slow, but consumers are rightfully reluctant. 3D technology is still undergoing changes that could lead to many previously (and current, for that matter) released 3D products to be rendered obsolete. However, if you are going to release a 3D version of one movie in some type of ""all encompassing"", ""cat's meow"", ultimate package, why would you not develop & release all of the movies in 3D? Here again, I feel confident in saying that these movies are already digitally mastered & stored in some super secret Disney location. And while it may take a computer some time to render the 3D-capable version of each movie, the state of today's technology pretty much assures that Disney could have released 3D versions of Lion King 1 1/2 & 2 with no delay to this box set's production & release dates.

This is one of those cases where the consumer needs to read. This is an attractive package...on the outside. The current discount to ~$50 makes it even more attractive. But, as soon as you start looking at the actual contents, the educated consumer will quickly see past the facade. Bought separately (and in the same formats), the movies would cost $77.97. At least this way, the consumer gets bona fide cases with disc trays for their movies. This may sound like a premium price, but it is a small up-charge when compared to the replacement cost of worn & scratched discs. Overall, I think the package has a ""rushed to market"" feel. Disney could have drastically improved the box set by completing the collection & putting a little more thought into the packaging...and ultimately, the target audience...kids.",1333065600,2,4323,4.63102998696219
2124182,4,B0002V7T5Q,"The first time we watched it the quality was amazing, the second time the blur ray did not work. My kids and I have always been huge fans of The Lion King.",1332979200,,155,3.875

2124185,5,B0002V7T5Q,"Like a story straight out of the greatest works of Shakespeare, The Lion King delivers a truly memorable and timeless experience from the word, ""GO!"" From the ascension of the African sun with the calls of the enchanting Zulu choir to the final ascension of the newly-crowned king to the throne of Pride Rock, Disney once again astounds and astonishes its audience with its mixture of captivating storytelling, thrilling music, lovable characters, and rich animation. This Blu Ray release has been long overdue, but Lion King fans from the original release and newcomers alike will be awed and inspired by the vibrant colors of the talented and legendary artists in Disney Animation. Nearly two decades have separated this release from its original theatrical appearance, and yet watching this Blu Ray gives the same feelings and thrills of watching it long ago in 1994 - when the world was radically different, with no threat of terror, a thriving economy, and naive sense of safety. Watchers will escape once again into the harsh and magical heart of Africa, as they witness Simba, the heir to the throne of Pride Rock, grow up from a cub safely at the side of his regal father, Mufasa - masterfully portrayed by James Earl Jones - through the trials and pains of adulthood. His uncle Scar is as menacing as we remember, friends Timon and Pumbaa as lovable, and Nala as enchanting.

One should do themselves a favor and purchase their own copy of The Lion King on Blu Ray before it goes back into the infamous Disney Vault. Adults with children should be cautioned if their child(ren) is/are of considerably young age - Mufasa's death is as saddening and moving as ever, and yet Hakuna Matata will have them singing and dancing around your house in no time.",1331251200,2,1759,4.805280528052806
2124186,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I ordered two of these as Christmas gifts and absolutely loved them. The box is very nice (but not super sturdy) and the disks are in an accordion type holder. I have not used each DVD yet, but I have watched one of the blu rays and the original movie in 3D. The quality was superior. We have always loved the Lion King and this set was the perfect way to get all of the DVDs.",1330992000,,376,3.960526315789474
2124187,5,B0002V7T5Q,"No comment on the movies - they are classics and this was to replace our stolen DVDs.

This is the best price around for all 3 (1, 1.5, 2) and the bonus stuff is just that, a bonus.  The birthday hasn't arrived yet so no comment based on actually viewing the bonus materials.

I will say when the first shipment arrived in a damaged box with the package also crumpled up I didn't even open and try to play the discs.  However, the return and replacement process with Amazon couldn't have been much easier given I never had to leave my house to purchase in the first place.  A couple of clicks and some keystrokes, print a form / label, box it up and drop it off at the post office.  Replacement was perfect condition and arrived well ahead of the commit date.",1330646400,2,759,4.2727272727272725
2124188,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I have had this collection since release, got it from Wally world (Wal-mart) at the stroke of midnight, I couldn't wait for UPS..  So back to the movie, The overall case design is exellent, the only irkful thing is the flimsy Sleeve system going on with the Blu-ray/DVD's who on earth designed it? a KID?? I quickly ran over to Best Buy and purchased some empty jewel cases for my investment to LAST LONGER.  I do love this series a whole lot.. LK 1 1/2 wasn't a strong movie but it was funny at points, then finshed on a good note. The original movie sounded superb on my surround sound system from Pioneer. This movie even killed my subwoofer after a few play throughs. Those elephants in the beginning really kill subs!! The whole first movie is really done well, I haven't seen the 3-d version at home yet, no 3d tube :-(  but I did see it on passive 3d at the Alamo Drafthouse in NW Austin... 3d is oversold, at least in the passive 3d mode.. The only 3d parts were Zazu in the beginning and maybe a few parts when Simba see's Nala for the first time since Mufasa's death. Other than that, WHAT 3D??? But to be honest,  a almost 20 year old movie that has any 3d is surprising.. I guess they did some major under the hood work??  The whole 1st movies plot is out of a play.. An Uncle plots to overthrow the throne, tries to kill the true heir, but fails on the later because the henchmen are idiots..  Then the movie throws in subliminal messages ALL OVER.. When we see Simba get the red stuff smeared on his forehead, it has a dirty word spelled out, and most of the Grass blades do as well, so does the dust Simba kicks up when He lays down.. It's on youtube, someone makes ALL the dirty words pop out.. I guess that disney wasn't finished with Little Mermaid when they had Adult toys as pillars on the VHS cover??  Back to the 2nd movie, it tries to finish the whole movie up, it does seem rushed at points, it was after all a DVD only release, I was hoping for a 3d release of LK2 Simba's Pride in the future.. LK2 isn't so sick in the head with messages in the grass,dust,etc., It's a cleaner movies for the kiddies. Overall, Great movie set, for the TRUE fan of the movie series.. Just get jewel cases if you want your disc's to last more than a year.. Especially in homes with nosey kids.. Also, I want to point out the Lion King 2 DVD that was released BEFORE this set was terrible, it had a bit of the screen blacked out, the NEW DVD and Blu-ray in this set resolved that issue!! these movies will take up every inch of your flat screen.. The plot of the 2nd movie was kind of on the same idea of the original, just different artists and scriptwriters/director.. This set is a good gift idea, I'm still happy with it, I hope one day to watch the 3d version at home, or a buddies house..",1329350400,,2800,4.202979515828678
2124189,5,B0002V7T5Q,This movie made my childhood!!!! If I was in a coma I would want my parents to bring my this movie. This HD remaster of the movie looks amazing and sounds amazing (Especially when I sing to it). All I can say is that the circle of your life will never be complete if you do not watch this movie. You will have Hakuna Matata for the rest of you life if you watch it. I just could not wait to be king when I saw this movie and I could feel the love that night. If you are having a bad day or are in serious depression then this will fix that. Just buy it!!!,1326931200,2,555,3.793103448275862

2124191,4,B0002V7T5Q,"This is a good set for a collector, for an avid fan. I would not recommend this set if kids are going to be the ones frequently taking discs in and out of the case. The case is made of cardboard, but that's fine. It's not a case to be played with, it's meant to sit on a shelf, plain and simple. I am not a huge fan of how the discs are in the case (see product photos). It's basically an accordion type sleeve that you slide the discs into. All in all though, I would say this is a really nice set, and really a good value. It looks nice sitting on the shelf amongst the other movies.",1326585600,2,585,3.8833333333333333

2124207,5,B0002V7T5Q,"This set is really nice in that it comes with a Blu-ray and a DVD of each movie, as well as a digital copy and a 3D version of the first movie.  The case is really cool, in that the discs come in an African drum-type case, which then comes in a nice box with Lion King art.  With the box it will fit nicely on a shelf with other movies, but the discs themselves come in a circular disc sleeve of sorts, which fits inside the drum.  The setup is a bit cumbersome, but looks very nice.  Lion King is an amazing movie, possibly one of the best Disney movies, and everyone should watch it.  Lion King 2 is simply okay; kids will enjoy it, but adults will not find it nearly as enjoyable as the first.  Lion King 1 and 1/2 centers on Timon and Pumba, and is more enjoyable than the second movie.  All in all it's a great trilogy, and certainly worth owning.",1323475200,,852,4.065868263473054

i bought this set when it was on special. with shipping, it cost me about $75NZD. i can buy the 8 disc set here, but it comes in a plain old dvd case and a price tag of $145NZD. its no wonder people buy online rather than instore these days.
i adore the box and drum, and bought an 8 disc case to store the movies in, rather then risk the box getting damaged by regular opening and closing.

I still decided to create a review so Disney or whoever, if information like this actually makes it anywhere, that the case is horrible. I don't like it personally, but the biggest disappointment was it didn't even come properly packaged. There is a slit for each movie and some discs weren't even in a slit by themselves, they were next to another movie. Luckily nothing was damaged. The black string that is suppose to help pull out the drum wasn't behind the drum, so I had to carefully pull the drum out. I guess no big deal, but it's someone's job to make sure the equipment is packaged correctly so nothing breaks and someone failed to do their job.",1322438400,4,747,4.420289855072464

Be aware that I am rating this product 3 stars because of packaging and lack of Disney's professionalism, not because of the movie itself, The Lion King will ALWAYS be one of my favorite movies of all times, no doubt, and I also loved part 2 and 1 1/2, but if you're only interested in the first movie, please value your money and go buy the cheaper editions which are exactly the same.

I got this as a birthday present, and I AM happy about it because I love the movies as I said before, but the packaging is awful. Yes, the craved box is pretty and the drum is cute even though both are a waste of space and materials, but where the discs come it's just a VERY fragile and lousy carton container. Sure, I can handle with it, I'm 24 y/o, I am careful with my belongings, but a kid will lose, break and/or tear apart this version in the blink of an eye, it is delicate indeed.

As for questioning Disney's professionalism... this version made me did it. I'm a native Spanish speaking person, and when I was a kid, watching movies in English with Spanish subtitles helped me learn a lot; I'm sure there's a lot of people that does it the other way around, and here's where my complain takes place: the subtitles have TYPOS! Even the Karaoke in Spanish, and not only typos, but the words don't match at all in about 10% of the whole first film! Seriously, Disney? Publishing a classic like this with typos and random fills that don't make sense? It really annoyed me, I felt like they didn't take the Spanish version seriously.",1320969600,8,1742,4.454545454545454

What is disappointing with this set and hence only the 3 stars
1) The lack of digital copies for the latter two films if you see the Toy Story or Cars sets, all films in the set came with digital copies - This might not be an issue to everyone, but in this digital age, putting the films on a iPad et al, is very useful for trips.
2) The way the discs were packaged, they were `clumped together' and sitting vertically in the `drum'. Not only could this be damaging to the discs over time, this was a complete waste of space.",1320451200,2,696,4.0071942446043165

It might look good from the outside, but inside is a cheap cardboard drum and the discs are stored in an even cheaper cardboard holder.

My question to Disney: does it really add that much cost to use the latest plastic slimline bluray cases? I can see the discs getting scratched with repeated use by sliding in and out of their sleeves. Plus, I can't store the discs in my rack with all of my other movies. This box is cute on the outside, but will join my ever growing collection of ""collector packages"" that I have no room for and are sitting in a closet.

2124224,5,B0002V7T5Q,"Finally after years of waiting for a re-release it finally happens and instead of slowly waiting for each movie to be released, they kindly released all three at the same time! This truly is a package that is worthy of the Lion King fans around the globe. I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday, she is a HUGE Lion King fan, but to be honest a part of me wanted to re-live my childhood movie experience as well.

Packaging:
First let's talk about the packaging. The movies arrive in an African-themed box that pays homage to various scenes from the first movie. The box itself is surprising well-made and very sturdy. The box opens like a small door in the front to reveal a drum inside that actually houses the movies (ie: think of it as a box in a box). The drum is also surprisingly study, so you can tell Disney put great care in to the creation of this Collector's edition. Once you twist off the top of the drum you'll see a Simba DVD-housing for the actual movies, this is the only part of the packaging that you really need to be careful with. The DVD-housing is held together by two Velcro-like straps that can very easily rip off if torn too hard, definitely open it for your children. The housing folds out like an accordion and you'll see a plethora of DVDs and Blurays.

Physical Content:
There are a total of 8 discs included in this set. Here is the breakdown of discs:
Lion King: 3d Bluray, Bluray, DVD, Digital Copy
Lion King 1/2: Bluray, DVD
Lion King 2: Bluray, DVD
So, there's a total 4 Blurays, 3 DVDs, and 1 Digital Copy, which I believe is ONLY the first movie, but I have yet to try it. Disney definitely did not skim out on supplying a complete Collector's edition, which is actually quite surprising, because Disney can milk a product like crazy when they want to. (For example, Diamond vs Platinum editions? Honestly, just include the extras on both discs and stop milking the double-sets.)

Movies:
Not surprisingly the quality on these movies is just as great as before and the experience only gets better on Bluray, especially on scenes like the stampede with your surround sound turned up. The 3D content looks good and is appropriately placed and definitely not over-done, so you don't have to worry about it simply being a ""gimmick"".

All-in-all this is a must-have for Lion King fans, both diehard and casual alike. Make sure you get this set while you can before Disney decides to cut off the production, like they do with all of their series, and you'll either have to fork out four times the normal price or wait patiently for a few decades to go by before the next big re-release.",1319328000,2,2628,4.50314465408805
2124225,5,B0002V7T5Q,"Just have to say the picture of this does NOT do it any justice!! Every disc was in perfect condition. It arrived when it said it would, and my son absolutely LOVES this little collection we got him!! I give it 5 stars!!!!",1319068800,,222,4.186046511627907
2124226,3,B0002V7T5Q,A nice DVD set but quite frankly it's a bit overpriced for what it is.  The packaging is cheap and flimsy. Getting the regular edition rather than this special edition makes more sense and saves dollars.,1319068800,,203,4.638888888888889
2124227,2,B0002V7T5Q,"My family loves the movies (when we can view them)!  All the blu-ray versions will not play on the Samsung BD5700 player.

Let me rephrase this.  You can play one of the disks but then the remaining disks will stick on the Disney castle page.  I called Samsung for a resolution and they claim an updated firmware was required.  I installed the update and was able to view the disks (ONCE).  Afterwards the same issue occured.

The only workaround is to unplug the Samsung unit to clear something in the unit.  Afterwards you can view only 1 of the blu-rays before the issue occurs again.

Why does Disney have to make this such an issue?",1318896000,,637,4.469565217391304
2124228,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I bought this a few days ago, and it just came today in the mail. I am very pleased with the set. I only had the VHS of the first movie, which bit the dust, so I am excited to have all three movies!

What I really like is that in the original Lion King, they've kept it to the original theatrical release. Meaning that the added song, Morning Report, in the Special Edition that came out a while ago isn't in it. It's a cute song, but they had to use a different voice actor for Simba since the original one was too old. Plus, this was the way I first saw and grew up with Lion King.

Also, it looks that Disney has completely remastered The Lion King. (2 and 1 1/2 were made later on, so I don't think they needed it as much) This means that the lines in the animation are pristine, not 'scratchy' looking which is reminiscent of 90's and earlier animation. At first I felt a loss of nostalgia, but I soon got over it once I realized that this is how The Lion King was meant to be. The sound is beautiful and crystal clear as well.

The box it comes in seems to be a harder, condensed form of cardboard, as is the drum. The box is textured, giving a carved wood feel. The top of the drum pulls apart, revealing the CD's. They are kept in an accordion-style paper-board container. It's probably not the best of places to keep a CD, but it doesn't seem like they'll be moving around much and a few pieces of that soft paper that comes with protective CD sleeves can easily fix any potential problems.

Altogether a great deal. At $75 it is less than $10 a disc and right now Amazon has free shipping on it. I highly recommend this set to anyone who grew up as a Disney kid or collects the movies. This was the first movie I saw with my sister in theaters, and the first movie I owned. And now I have a set that will last so I can pass on the magic to my own children.",1318636800,2,1866,4.048780487804878

I received the movies in the box as pictured with drum inside.  The only reason why I put 4 out of 5 stars is because I was thinking that all movies will be in individual blu ray movie cases but when you open the sealed box then open the drum all the disks are in this small case packaging loose. So that was my only disappointment because I like my movies in their individual cases so they won't get scratched. But other then that I'm very happy about this box set and ill just have to keep each movie in this box set so it will stay in great condition.

When I opened the drum this is where I was really disappointed..It came with an accordion file cardboard that the disc can easily take out..which in fact if you watch a lot it can be easily scratched!!

Another thing I was very disappointed was the fact that Amazon shipping department lacked its shipping process!!

2124236,4,B0002V7T5Q,"The movies are, of course, great movies. They all have GORGEOUS picture and sound quality, even compared to the older DVD versions of them. It felt as if I was watching them in the theaters, and one would never guess the sequels were DTV.

The packaging, however, leaves much to be desired. The box itself is of very thick cardboard (so thick, I originally mistook it for wood). The drum inside is of slightly less thick cardboard. It's the slots the discs are in that's my worry. Inside the drum is a thin cardboard holder with two strips of the same thin cardboard separating each disc. Two just as thin cardboard straps are on top of the slips to keep the discs from falling out, and the ends of those strips have Velcro on them, to detach and reattach the straps to the slips (for the sake of removing the discs). Sadly, the Velcro not only easily comes off, it also has a high chance of scratching the discs on their way out (the fact that the discs are hard to remove as it is only heightens the risk). I ended up scratching The Lion King 2's disc the first time I took it out thanks to the Velcro, though the disc still played okay.

All in all, it's great getting all three movies and I'm glad I bought this. Just plan on spending a few more bucks on DVD cases to put the discs in to keep them from getting scratched up, which is what I plan on doing.",1317859200,2,1359,4.223076923076923

The box it comes in is a sturdy yet the door panel tends to get out of place if not careful, the tamborine, or however its spelled, is very nice and elegant but the top and bottom look like rough cardboard cut to fit in there and glued.  When you open the tamborine, it reveals the disks accordion style file case in which it is flimsy and if not careful, it can break easily so be warned not to let small children touch it as it can break with ease.  Other than this ""defects"" I found the whole set to be very nice looking that if they would have put a bit more efford into it, it would have become priceless.

2124241,3,B0002V7T5Q,"This is one of Disney's worst Diamond Editions yet. You would think for as much as Disney is charging for the set they would make sure that all the bonus features are available to all owners. To access most of the classic features you have to be connected to the internet and get BD-Live. There are no games or activities on the movies. I think Disney should have worried less about putting Lion King in 3D and paid more attention to bonus features. If this is the best animated movie of all time I would think Disney could have come up with more features, or at least included all the classic features.
 I am giving this release a 3 star because the movies look great despite the lack of features. By the way for those of you wondering, the Lion King is the original theatrical release. In order to see the Morning Report you have to go to bonus features.",1317686400,2,856,4.35

The packaging is by far the worst part about this, it is so large and clumsy.  The sleeves that hold the discs are a pain, and the box doesn't fit in on my shelf next to my other blurays very nicely.  I wish the 3 movies were released seperately so that I could have them in standard bluray cases, but oh well, I guess this will have to do, The movies are so good its worth the extra trouble for me personally.",1317686400,,548,3.9545454545454546

The outside of the box is very lovely, with wood-like carving imagery on the outside. But once you open the case it comes in, you are in for a disappointment. The discs are in thin cardboard! There are no cases to hold the discs. You just slide them out of their ""file"" type thin cardbard. I can see this set getting very scratched in the near future if you watch these a lot. I only bought this set because I wanted all 3 movies. I suggest everyone wait and buy each separately in a appropriate blu ray case release. I would have rather had all three movies in actual blu ray cases inside this nice box, than this cheap, crappy drum. I expected much more, Disney...",1317686400,108,786,4.275167785234899

They are essentially packaged in an accordian file folder, easily scratched if you're not careful. And they don't have soft lining behind them, basically you're resting the dvd on a piece of cardboard. For what you pay for this, it could be packaged better.  I only wanted movies in Blu-Ray, it's the only way I can get 1 1/2 and II.  Calling Amazon now, to return.  I'll wait for 1 1/2 and II to be released seperately, they will eventually.",1317686400,2,604,4.454545454545454

2124246,5,B0002V7T5Q,"So I recently watched the Lion King in the theatres, and it was still as magical as I remember it was growing up. After reading some of the reviews on here, there seems to be a little mix-up as to what you get, so I would just like to clarify in case someone is interested in this amazing trilogy, which by the way has a beautiful outer wood box.

The Lion King comes with the 3D blu-ray, the standard blu-ray, the standard DVD, and digital copy.

The Lion King 1.5 comes with the standard blu-ray and the standard DVD.

The Lion King 2 comes with the standard blu-ray and the standard DVD.

As you can tell, only the original Lion King comes with 3D and digital copy, so it is basically the same thing as the regular 4 disc 3D pack you can get. The other 2 movies only have the standards of each format, so you can treat them as basic combo packs. I hope this helps clarify a few matters and whatever you do, definately pick this movie up.",1317600000,329,940,4.176795580110498
2124247,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I only paid about $55. for mine only because I am a disney movie club member, and I pre-ordered this with the Pirates of the Caribbean, so with my member discount it brought it down to $53. something... anyways, you get the lion king 1, 1 1/2, and 2 in blu-ray 3d, which i probably won't use since 3d isn't installed on my tv, blu-ray, dvd, and digi copy of all them :) That's like 9 copys of the movie in a disc format and then 3 digi copys for your ipod or whatever movie device you own... I am very anxious to receive mine.

Update: I was wrong... here is what's included...

- THE LION KING 4-Disc Set With Blu-ray 3D(TM), Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy
- THE LION KING 2: SIMBA'S PRIDE 2-Disc Set With Blu-ray and DVD
- THE LION KING 1 1/2 2-Disc Set With Blu-ray and DVD

All 3 movies are on blu-ray and dvd, however only the lion king 1 is on blu-ray 3d and digital copy... shame they should all be digital copy's, but guess you can't have everything... Still a great value.

Update: Just received mine in the mail today... Good movies and everything, but bad case... The box and drum is good to keep them in, but it is nothing but cardboard for the blu-ray/dvds... That is crappy :( They should switch that and then it'd be good :)",1317340800,2,1239,4.19327731092437
2124248,5,B0002V7T5Q,"I just came back from watching the Lion King 3D in theaters. It was beautiful. The people in the the theatre were like a community, or a family, reminiscing of fond memories of this great movie. It was so good, I cannot stress myself enough about how much you have to see this in theatres one last time.

About the trilogy pack, I'm guessing it will be similar to the Toy Story Toy Box trilogy pack, except only The Lion King has a digital copy, which is very disappointing.

This movie is part of me.  When Scar says ""Long live the King"" and dropped Mufasa into the stampede, I get so angry I usually swear at the TV. When the songs come on, I always get the goosebumps. Screw the S E X controversy, screw the Kimba the White Lion Controversy, and screw the stupid ass hyena controversy. This movie rules. No, rocks. No,.... there isn't a word to describe these films.

2124249,3,B0002V7T5Q,"I just ordered the 4-disc Lion King set which includes the 3-D version on Blu-ray, 2-D version on Blu-ray, the Extras probably on DVD (but could be on blu-ray) and the 4th disc (Digital Copy) definately on DVD.

I followed the link to the ""Blu-ray"" Lion King Trilogy and read the reviews.  Seems like everyone thinks all three films are in 3-D or 2-D and that all 3 films are in the Blu-ray format.

Time to get this corrected or those who might order this set thinking all 3 films are in 3-D and on Blu-ray.

ONLY the first LION KING is on Blu-ray with 3-D and 2-D versions.  The (two) sequels are NOT Blu-ray discs so they are NOT high-definition.  They are the same discs you probably purchased years ago because if Disney was going to spend the money to remaster them they'd add 3-D to them even if the 3-D is artificial as the last two weren't filmed in 3-D.  Also these last two films are NOT 3-D either, but only 2-D.

To me this deal is simply not worth the money Amazon is asking and actually, even if you don't own the (two) sequels already on DVD, they are over-priced should they cost over $5 each.  And (for people like me) Digital Copies are utterly worthless.  I have an Apple Ipad 2 and you can't transfer them to an Ipad (which is the only size screen to be able to watch the movie on a trip and be able to enjoy the movie properly by being able to actually see what's going on on the screen.  Ipods or Iphones are simply too small to enjoy a movie on.  So I simply throw the Digital Copies I get away.  I would rather have a real DVD instead of Digital Copies with the Blu-rays so at least I can loan the dvd out to friends who don't yet have blu-ray.

Also the extras on Lion King 1+1/2 and 2 are most likely on the same disc the movie is on.  So the disc count now would be 1) LION KING 1 (4 discs), 2) LION KING 1+1/2 (1 dvd disc), LION KING 2 (1 dvd disc) which equals 6 discs.  Now add in Digital Copies for the 2 last films and that equals 8 discs TOTAL.

I gave this set only 3 Stars instead of 5 because the whole set isn't in Blu-ray high-definition.  If THE LION KING 4-disc set is as good as every Disney 3-D release I will give it 5 stars.

Re-check the disc count Amazon states comes with this set and I think you'll find there is only 8 discs total.

I just wanted to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are getting when/if they order this set so no one gets disappointed.  I know I'd be very disappointed if I ordered this and found the majority of the discs are only DVDs!

Hope I was of some help to you.",1316822400,4,2546,4.0804828973843055
2124250,5,B0002V7T5Q,"Ive seen the lion king when it first came out.  It is truly a magical disney classic!  Ive never seen the other 2 films, i cant wait to see the combo pack!!:)",1316390400,,158,3.90625
2124251,5,B0002V7T5Q,"The Lion King is one of Disney's animated ""golden age"" films (along with little mermaid, alladin, etc.), and it really is a timeless classic.

for the pre-order price of about $75, it's a great value considering the 4 disc blue-ray set alone is going to run you at least $30, Lion King 2 around $20 and 2 1/2 maybe $15. Shell out a few more bucks and you get a nifty box to keep everything in and you know that you have the complete collection, special features and all.

The great thing about the 4 disc blu ray combo pack for the ORIGINAL Lion King, is that it includes:
 the regular 2D movie dvd & blu-ray disc, a 3D blu-ray disc, (this ensures that whatever technology you are currently using, you will be able to watch the movie, regardless. and if you are using DVD now, you will have blu-ray for later when you upgrade. or you can always give away whichever one you don't want/need.)
 and the digital copy which I always love as an option. Digital copies allow you to upload to mobile devices (especially easy for itune users although it might restrict usage to apple devices), such as your phone, tables (great for keeping you or maybe your kids entertained on trips or when waiting for stuff), and of course, your laptops and computers.

for the other 2 movies, Lion King 2 and Lion King 1 1/2, there is a DVD & Blu-ray copy for each.

The set also includes all the bonus discs for all three movies, which of course has all the bonus features: deleted scenes, commentary, shorts, new songs, etc etc.

It's a great value and would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys Disney Animated Movies.

(if you don't need/want all the bells and whistles or the other movies, then another version might be better for you. the 2disc DVD/blu-ray also has the special features, just not the 3D or the digital copy)",1314748800,45,1811,4.450151057401813

2124254,4,B0002V7T5Q,"Lion King is, without a doubt, one of the finest films that Disney has ever produced.  It has a moving story with profound themes - the passage of power in a royal household, the loss of innocence, the enduring strength of love -  and a wonderful array of colorful characters.  Every time I watch that film, I am moved by Simba's difficult coming of age, his hard-won wisdom at accession to office, and his re-finding of a self that was all but lost.  It is truly beautiful with plenty of comic relief thrown in that adds to the story and never detracts from it.  OK, the slightly longer version here includes some songs that are longer and a few scenes that were not in the theatre version, all of which seem rather superfluous, but the story is still essentially perfect.  This is 5 stars, easy.

The two films that follow have many weaknesses.  The second is largely a repeat, only with inferior graphics, inferior songs, and less interesting characters.  It is a 2-star performance.  The third is marginally better, i.e. the story of Pumba and Timon told in retrospect alongside the original story, recapitulating it but adding detail.  It is not bad, 3 stars.  Alas, I thought the attempt to cash in on perfection as pretty crass.  That being said, my kids enjoyed both versions very much, similar to the way they enjoy TV.

I would recommend getting the first film in another format.  The follow-ons can be seen by rent, if you must.",1304640000,,1439,4.610236220472441
