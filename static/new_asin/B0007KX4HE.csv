2216120,3,B0007KX4HE,"First, the good points of the DVD: the French phrases are useful ones; they are introduced logically, repeated often, and the quizzes give kids the chance to practice and reinforce. Now the negative: the quality of the acting and the graphics is really cheesy - which is not the end of the world, especially for kids ... but what bothers me most is that the sound quality is awful. Even being able to speak French myself, I had a hard time hearing what was said in several places, just because it's blurred and the sound level is inconsistent. Also, in many places the learning happens only through written cues onscreen, which is okay for an adult, but not for the preschool age that the DVD is suitable for. My 4 1/2 yr old can use the remote enough to get through the quizzes himself, but I still have to stick around to read the text to him! So, unfortunately, a good concept, but poorly executed. I would still buy this DVD though; my son enjoys it, and it's a useful learning tool. Just don't expect too much.",1150934400,64,1015,4.433155080213904
2216121,5,B0007KX4HE,"I'm very surprised at the negative reviews. While this DVD is clearly not made from Walt Disney Studios, it does what it's supposed to do - introduce French words and phrases to children in an easy-to-follow way. The actors speak authentic French. What is taught is quite useful - introductions,counting, colors, playing, food, etc. The actors use these words and phrases within a simple storyline and they are again repeated during the review section. They are also repeated once more in the songs that are scattered throughout the DVD (the songs are pretty catchy by the way - more so than in other children's videos). So, if you are looking for pure entertainment,

this video is probably not for you but if you want a tool that can hold your child's attention and teach them French, then you should give this a try.",1146528000,73,819,4.7272727272727275
2216122,5,B0007KX4HE,"Thank you Language Tree

French for Kids has my kids off to a great start with French.

When I was a kid we didn't have fun interactive DVD's like this one to learn French...

Merci",1145923200,6,181,4.114285714285714
2216123,1,B0007KX4HE,What a mistake.  Worse than just lame.  Wish I took the time to read the critical reviews before purchasing.  Badly made with little thought and effort; a poor money for value investment.,1145059200,10,187,4.78125
2216124,5,B0007KX4HE,"As a native French speaker, I'd really like my daughter to speak French well.  French for Kids has proven to be a great tool.  The kid actors in the video speak excellent French and having children the same age speak the language was easier for my daughter to relate to.  There is a lot of repetition, which by the end of the video my daughter already remembered several phrases.  We now are using the mealtime phrases at home and get a real kick out of it.  My daughter loved the music and cute animated dog character, Pezi.  I would recommend this video to anyone.",1141776000,8,566,4.394230769230769
2216125,3,B0007KX4HE,"Good points: the French taught is authentic, useful and  relevant for a young child.  The French speakers have standard accents and speak slowly enough for a child learning the language but not so slowly that they distort the language.  But Language Tree could have done SO much more.  In the end there is actually very very little taught.

Not so good points: the little quizzes are silly and don't seem like the best way to reinforce what is taught, certainly not to a child.  I'd like to see more repetition (children saying the words over and over in different situations). I think anybody much older than 5 would be bored with this, and younger than that, most kids aren't good enough at the DVD remote control to be able to do the quizzes by themselves (or even understand the concepts).

My 3 year old quite enjoys this DVD (which is why I gave it 3 stars and not 1) but it requires that I sit there with her the whole time (you cannot bypass the lame and tiresome quizzes).

I don't mind that it's filmed in somebody's living room.  What I cannot understand is why the host (now I'm sure he's a nice guy... but...) is even in this DVD.  He is clearly uncomfortable in front of a camera, his French accent on the few words he speaks isn't good, and it looks like the doorbell rang while he was making his costume and he never got to finish it.

All that said, I will actually buy the Volume 2 DVD if it's available.  As per above, my daughter likes it....",1130889600,20,1462,4.354243542435424
2216126,5,B0007KX4HE,"This is a great film, I highly recommend it!

Our kids are learning French and this film is a great boost to their French vocabulary. They love to watch the film and I hear them talking to the video and trying to guess the answers in French.

This film is definitely helping them acquire basic works like numbers and colors.

Once the film is over, they also sing along some of the French songs, which always amazes me :)",1129766400,8,421,4.30379746835443
2216127,4,B0007KX4HE,I purchased this DVD for my 3 year old and soon realized that it was not for her. Within 15 minutes she lost interest. The actors spoke very fast and was often times unintelligible for a three year old to understand. I think that this would be great learning tool for an older child that could read the enclosed booklet at the same time. I am hoping that if I continue to play it that eventually she'll pick up small amounts of the language. At least then I can say I got my money's worth.,1110153600,10,489,4.157894736842105
2216128,5,B0007KX4HE,"My kids (3 and 5 years old) enjoy very much the film. They love guessing the answers for the games, and are already starting to sing the French songs.

I find this film a very good complement to the French songs we listen to. The words are simple and easy to catch on. And even my 3 year old shouts the colors along with the film! And the kids in the film have an energy that just keeps my kids interested.

It's just amazing how fast they can learn at that age.

Definitely a thumbs up!",1108944000,25,487,4.052083333333333
2216129,5,B0007KX4HE,This video has really helped my son a lot.  Hes in Montessori school and they are beginning to introduce French. To give him a leg up I purchased this DVD and its great to see him ahead of his class.  The things they teach are also in the songs and games so kids can really relate.  My son sings the catchy songs around the house and is using simple phrases at dinnertime.,1412899200,,372,4.138888888888889
2216130,2,B0007KX4HE,"This product was not very helpful in that most of the songs, or activities are not accompanied by the words, (in French or otherwise). This made the test your knowledge portion of the dvd difficult, as the actors speak quickly and it's hard to understand through their heavy accents. My children became discouraged after 20 minutes or so, due to not being able to follow along. I will shop for a different product to teach my children French.",1407369600,,442,4.67948717948718
2216131,3,B0007KX4HE,This video is not as clear as I would have liked it to be.  The audio is not clear as well. I had to rewind the dvd to hear what they actually said. I like the fact that it had songs that my daughter could remember. That is all,1387756800,,227,3.63265306122449
2216132,3,B0007KX4HE,"I know that this may seem silly, but I was searching for a French program - meaning a French interactive disc that I could use on my computer with my son to learn French.  Perhaps something with games, etc.

This DVD is great, but as I was shopping quickly I only skimmed the description and since I was searching for DVD-rom I thought it was for the computer.  I re-read after I received this and was surprised that it is still not very clear that it's a DVD.  It would be good for the title to say DVD.

As far as the DVD is concerned, it's fine.  However if you already have a lot of language DVDs, then it's the same thing....",1374624000,,630,4.122950819672131
2216133,1,B0007KX4HE,"Anything is better than nothing, so I can't tear it down completely, although I just reduced my 2 stars to 1 after watching it for the 4th time. The Interactive DVD portion is boring, doesn't always work w/the DVD remote (I think there is one wrong answer that frustrates my kid) and requires way too much parental intervention and kills the pacing.

Both this and the 2nd DVD could be fine if they ever revise them.  The production quality is better on the 2nd volume, but the subject matter covered is better in this episode.  This episode starts with the basics of greeting, but the 2nd volume inexplicably start to cover telling time in French with an analog clock, which my kid can't even do in English. So although it's 2 stars, it's still better than the 2nd volume in terms of subject matter.  There is an interactive function where there are true and false questions that your kid must maneuver with a DVD remote.  Sort of problematic in and of itself, but additionally there is an error on each volume where the correct choice doesn't work. ""Comment t'appelles tu"" has a problem in vol. 1 and Soupe a l'oignon is screwy in volume 2.  Confused my kid and frustrated him until I told him to press SKIP, that there was a mistake made on the DVD.

It's that kind of half-baked thing that plagues this video series, but that said, it still helps your kids as long as you stay in the room and correct and intervene.  The pronunciation of ""matin"" in Vol. 2 is so poor, that I had to tell my son the right way to say it. Even if you don't speak French and get hung up on pronunciation, you'll still notice problems.

But, that said, my kid watches it, asks to watch it.  So as long as I'm in the mood to play along, it still gets some of the job done.

I'm comparing this DVD to the following other similar offerings:
Professor Toto
Bonjour les Amis (vol 1-3)
Little Pim
and
Muzzy

It's my least favorite among all of those choices.",1370649600,3,1934,4.38655462184874

2216135,3,B0007KX4HE,"We borrowed this from the library prior to deciding to purchase based on some of the reviews about the audio.  Unfortunately, I have to agree that the audio is poor.  When the girl and her family are talking, there is music on in the background that makes it hard to hear the pronounciation.  If you are completely new to French, it is hard to distinguish the sounds.  The funny part is that the music goes away when the green shirted language tree guy comes on speaking in English so his voice is clear.  If the French speakers were able to speak without the background music they may have come through clearer.",1365638400,,612,4.4774774774774775
2216136,1,B0007KX4HE,"Can't hear/ understand much of the DVD, and really not a good place to introduce a beginner to the French language.",1353283200,4,115,4.523809523809524
2216137,3,B0007KX4HE,"I used and purchased this dvd for my son who is almost two years old. He is picking up words slowly but that's because of his attention span at this age. I would recommend this video for children five years and above for it feels like learning but it's done in a simple, fun and easy way that is easy to grasp. I wanted to get a early start on teaching my son French because for his dad that was his first language, I'm off to a great start. Using this dvd it is helping, I'm already seeing results.",1343433600,,499,4.05050505050505
2216138,5,B0007KX4HE,"This is a great introductory DVD that can help your children (and you) grasp the French language. The cast of very cute kids motivated my kids to want to learn to speak French.  There are a lot of useful lessons packed into this video so the more you play it, the more you can learn.  We also enjoyed the interactive games and songs that help us remember the words and phrases taught.

2216140,5,B0007KX4HE,"I really enjoyed this video, and more importantly so did my kids.  I put this on for my kids, 3 and 5, and they just love it.  While it seems a little fast at first, after the second or third time we watched it my kids were following along just fine, and now they can't stop singing the songs.  My kids really love pezi too! My favorite thing about these videos is that there are numerous volumes so my kids can keep learning.  I  also purchased the Spanish and German videos for my kids, which all follow the same format and keep my kids entertained.  The quality of the later videos are lot better.  Overall, I would recommend these videos, I think they give kids a nice introduction to foreign languages.",1281312000,,707,4.351145038167939
2216141,1,B0007KX4HE,"We actually checked this DVD out from the library, & I'm so glad that I was able to try it out before buying.  My children really didn't like the video, and the speakers spoke so fast that they quickly lost interest.  The production quality & sound quality were poor to say the least, which is my main concern.  I think there are definitely better DVD's out there if you are a parent, who may not know French, but want to learn with their children.  I really can't recommend this DVD as the quality was so poor.",1256083200,4,511,4.291666666666667
2216142,3,B0007KX4HE,"Agree with some reviews above. I like the dvd a lot. However, I don't understand why the host is here. (altouhg he could be a very nice guy...) The host, Andre, seems not comfortable with children dvd production, has heavy American accent. I prefer they only use the family in the production. And his costum really look unrelevent to the show and funny ( a green leaf shirt).

Another thing is that the actors speak a little bit too fast. Since I don't speak French, it's kind of hard for me to grasp what exactly it has been said.

Good points: The French is authenic. Content is relevent to kids (birthday party).",1254355200,3,615,4.482142857142857

I know some french and I still struggled to follow.  I would recommend the Bonjour Les Amis videos before this, or if you have the money, get Muzzy.  It's an amazing program; much more captivating for children than these other movies. (and you get french, spanish, german, english, and british english all in one set. :)",1228003200,16,497,4.625

2216145,4,B0007KX4HE,"While an entertaining video for my little ones, 3 and 2, to watch, I think the sound quality is off.  I have been speaking French since I was a kid, and this video is a little tough for me to understand.  There needs to be more repetition with the words and phrases, they move too quickly through the segments.  I love the songs though!  They are cute and my kids adore the dog, Pezi, flying through the air with the balloons.  The learning tree guy is very strange and awkward!  His costume really makes no sense, and I had no idea what he was supposed to be!  The best part of the whole movie is when they are singing the un deux trois song and the tree man is dancing while eating the cake.  The grandmere is just sitting there watching him with the weirdest look on her face.  Hilarious!  I think the film is effective if you watch it with your kids and recite the words and phrases yourself.  My kids say a few things, but they learn better when they hear me repeat the words.",1204675200,2,981,4.192513368983957
2216146,5,B0007KX4HE,"I purchased this video for my 2 year old daughter and I've been amazed at
the results. She is saying ""merci"" now when I hand her a toy. I'm thrilled that she is picking up a foreign language, even if she doesn't quite understand all the words in the video. The fact that she enjoys learning is in itself great. She sings and dances along with the songs in the video. I love to watch her laugh aloud while she watches the video. Her favorite segment is when the kids play the French version of Simon Says. She points to her body parts right along with them.

I was worried about the sound quality based on the reviews, but the DVD sounded just fine.",1186963200,2,648,4.225806451612903
2216147,3,B0007KX4HE,"This is ok for a supplemental resource as you teach your child french, but alone it has some drawbacks. WHile the authentic french speakers are appreciated, it would be nice if the words were said in a slower and more deliberate manner when they are very first introduced or at some point in the process. Also, Andre, the host who is dressed like a tree (this seems a bit odd, even if the DVD's are made by Language Tree), speaks in english and tries to say the few french words he says with a horrible american accent. He is a bit of a distraction for me- maybe more me than my child! I really like the interactive part, but as I said in the beginning, just know that you really need to teach each lesson ahead of time by introducing the words little by little on your own to your child throughout the day and then use the DVD one lesson at a time as reinforcement after that.",1176336000,2,877,4.226190476190476
2216148,3,B0007KX4HE,"Overall, this DVD was pretty good.  Here are the things I did and didn't like.  I gave 3 stars b/c the cons outweigh the pros.
