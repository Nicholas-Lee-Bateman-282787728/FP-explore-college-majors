They thanked me for the thought, and this film but this was not the movie they wanted.  Opps. A good intention anyway.

8017279,2,B0001WTVJI,"Cast of the mucho-mediocre direct-to-video NIGHT OF THE WILDING includes former CHIPs star Erik Estrada (he currently plugs Ozark real estate on an infomercial) and John Travolta's older brother, Joey who hasn't been seen on screen for many a year. The balance of the picture's roster reads like a ""Who's This?"" list...

Purportedly based on the true case of a woman jogger who was intimately attacked by a youth gang in NYC's Central Park, here three inner-city juvies go on trial for sexual assault. We begin with the promising appetizer of a tense court case, but are immediately served up an entree of mindless slasher movie fare, plus a fake-looking car crash. Also, the same bit players appear as jurors in BOTH trials, which occur a year apart. And that's the GOOD stuff!

Attorney for the accused Joseph (Estrada) is opposed by a prosecutor who's his ex-wife. The young defendants charged with acts of ""wilding,"" which include random violent destruction, start knocking off anyone that's in the way of an acquittal. High on the list of targets is their lawyer's ex.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.

THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THREE YOUNG BOYS WHO COMMIT A DOUBLE RAPE AND ASSAULT WITH INTENTION TO KILL. NOW, THEIR CASE IS BEING PLEAD BY AN UNDEFEATED ATTORNEY [ERIK ESTRADA, IN ONE OF HIS BETTER PERFORMANCES] WHO'S KNOWN FOR HELPING GUILTY CRIMINALS AVOID GOING TO JAIL. BUT, HIS EX-WIFE IS THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WHO'S ALSO UNDEFEATED IN THE COURTROOM. SO, WHO WILL WIN THE CASE? AND WILL THESE THREE BOYS GO TO JAIL FOR WHAT THEY DID? WELL, YOU'LL WANT TO FIND OUT WHEN YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE, WHICH HAS SOME DECENT ACTING AND A SUPRISINGLY DECENT STORYLINE.",1118620800,6,649,4.603448275862069
