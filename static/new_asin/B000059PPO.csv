1408741,3,B000059PPO,"I have mixed feelings, even though I am a declared Herzog's fan. It's not a [bad] movie, don't get me wrong. It's very well done, like all Herzog productions - pictures, music, atmosphere etc. - no dissappointments here. First I thought it was Kinski that was not here. Well, his absence is certainly challenging to both the director and a viewer, but on the second thought no, it sure is not Kinski that misses here. I am simply not sure if I like the moral concept of the movie. War, abuse, violence - I am against too, but it should have been sad less straight-forwardly than just ""war is bad, violence is bad, those guys are poor"". He doesnt say that of course, but you can feel it - and it makes the movie sound like a Dangler's confession, really, and I don't feel well in a priest's shoes. Then I thought it could be a good documentary, but somehow Herzog cannot keep a necessary distance, he is obviously engaged while reportage should keep a colder distance and not be so charged with emotions, which makes the movie lose out on artistic atmosphere. So? I think buy it only if you know what you are doing. There are better Herzogs out there to start with first. You can always come back later.",1037577600,4,1202,4.418918918918919
1408742,5,B000059PPO,"This is one of the most powerful films one will ever see, period.
It is one of Herzog's best and the fact that everything in it is true is all the more inspiring and sad. I have never seen anything like this. It is not a normal documentary because it is relies on the poetry of images, dialogue and music in ways most fictional films can only inspire to. This is not a film to throw on while you putz around the house but one to watch and embrace with open arms. It intrigues, fascinates and if you open your heart just a little, it just may change your view of the world and those in it. Herzog has said that he wants to give the world new images to dream and think about. And in this film, a true story, he finds images of war and death and beauty and transcedence in the most passionate sense. A must see.",1015545600,42,808,4.05625
1408743,5,B000059PPO,"As the documentary begins, we hear Werner Herzog's voice telling us that there are events in some people's lives that haunt them forever, but that if we pass these people on the street or in their car, we would never know it, for they appear normal. That in part is what this movie is about. It's also about how a dream might come to us and take hold of us, and how if we are determined to make the dream come true we can never know where it will lead, just as we can never fully understand why the dream came to us in the first place.
We first see Dieter in his house atop a hill outside of San Francisco (he has lived in America for 40 years; the film is in English, there are no subtitles).  He talks about how important doors are to him, that he can never take them for granted because when he was in the prison camp he was not able to open or close any doors. He talks about always having plenty of food in the house, even storing extra in the basement, because he never wants to go hungry again.
Then we are in Germany, in the small town where he grew up. He watched planes flying over his town as a boy during World War II.  One flew very close to his upstairs window and from that moment he knew he needed to fly. He says he didn't want to go to war, he only wanted to fly. Yet the airplanes he saw as a child, the ones that created the dream in him, were war planes. This is not a simple story.  Dieter came to America when he was 18 years old, with no money, speaking only a few words of English, and almost immediately joined the Air Force. But he never got near an airplane. Over time as he learned how things work, he figured out what he needed to do. He moved to California and went to college, living out of a VW van.  Then he joined the Navy where at last he learned to fly. He was sent to Vietnam and soon thereafter was shot down over Laos.
To give you some idea of the structure of the film, it is essentially the story of where Dieter's desire to fly led him, told more or less chronologically beginning in his childhood up to the present. We don't learn anything else about Dieter or his life. The story is completely focussed on this one aspect of his life.  And Werner Herzog mostly lets Dieter tell his own story. When he talks about his childhood,  he is in Germany, talking and showing us around the town. When he talks about his time in the prison camp, the filming takes place in an unnamed Asian country (the production notes at the end say it was indeed Laos). There is some reenactment, such as Dieter having his hands tied behind his back and walking through jungle. This is the sort of thing that could go very wrong in a movie, but in Werner Herzog's hands it works beautifully.  It's not clear whether the villagers taking part in the reenactments know what is going on, or what they think. It's not clear whether being there and reexperiencing these events is helping Dieter chase away his demons or making matters worse. All this adds to the dreamlike and mythic quality of the movie. This is a very big story. And what makes the movie so successful, is Dieter himself. He is a master storyteller. At home in San Francisco he is sad and haunted. But in the jungle he is filled with energy and there is a sense of urgency to his speaking, as if he realizes how much he needs to tell his story.  I could not take my eyes from the screen and could have listened to him talk for hours.
And talk he does. About the three week walk to the prison camp, about conditions in the camp, about their plans to escape. There is great attention to detail, such as showing how they got out of their handcuffs, and showing a map of the camp to describe how their plan was to work. As harrowing as the details of the camp were, even more difficult to hear was the long walk barefoot through the jungle after the escape.  Dieter sits cross-legged on the dock of the Mekong River, recounting this journey, quietly but forcefully telling his story. I promise that this will make your heart ache.
Don't look for any reflection on the events. Never does Werner Herzog ask Dieter whether he is sorry he pursued his dream with such single-minded determination. We are left to draw our own conclusions. Some of the timing of events is unclear. We're not sure how long he was in Vietnam before he got shot down, nor how long he was held prisoner, but it seems to be less than six months. We're told that he took early retirement from the Navy but we're not told when he retired or whether he continued to serve in Vietnam after he was rescued.  But these are not criticisms. This movie is made up of complex levels of dreams within dreams and these slight omissions add to that mood. Herzog has done a brilliant job of putting together an amazing story. This is one of the finest movies I've seen in a long, long time.",1012089600,115,4828,4.243743199129488

1408749,4,B000059PPO,"This movie is compelling for several reasons as it studies Dieter Dengler's past and present.  He is quite an exceptional person for having the terror of observing as the Allied forces blew away his village during the bombing of Germany partially destroying his building while he watched and loosing his father to the war.  It is the flight of these planes that convince a youngster to become a pilot. Later, he and his family had overcome hunger and terrible poverty that they search destroyed building for wallpaper so they can cook it and eat the glue.  With less than a dollar, he arrives in the U.S. determined to become a pilot.  He first serves in one branch of the U.S. military and eventually becomes a pilot in the Navy in the midst of the Vietnam War.

His job is to bomb targets to inhibit the advance of the Viet Cong but he is shot down over Laos and is captured.  He is walked from nearly one side of Laos to the other which bordered N. Vietnam and the trek through the jungle itself was near impossible for nearly a month.  He arrives at the prison camp and endures another six months near starvation and horrific torture.  It is he and another man, who plot an escape for the entire prisoner camp to the minutiae.  Soon, it is just he and his friend that survive.  Their trek to Cambodia is a living nightmare and he watches helpless as his friend die before him.  Eventually, Dieter is spotted by a military pilot and rescued.

This story is nothing short of amazing; his ability to cope in one seemingly hopeless situation after another while starving is nothing short of miraculous.  Werner Herzog has him revisit the region and he reenacts his journey with villagers carrying machine guns for realism.  It has a powerful effect on both the viewer and Dieter.  At times, it is as though you are back there with Dieter in the midst of the horror.  The viewer can not help but wonder how he is able to relive the traumatic past and at times you see the deep pain that remains.  It is no wonder that he is emotionally disconnected from so much of the world.  His PTSD was so severe that buddies would sneak him out of the hospital and put him in a cockpit surrounded by pillows since it was the only place he felt safe.  He continued to fly after he recuperated and after he retired from the military continued to work as a civilian pilot.

Ive watched this documentary twice and each time I marvel at Dieters ingenuity and survival instincts.  His story is so phenomenal it sounds as though it were fiction.  I find his challenges at times overwhelming and sympathize with him for enduring the ghosts that continue to haunt him.  He is a courageous man that appears to fail to fully recognize his capacity to survive no matter the seeming insurmountable barriers before him.",1412553600,,2792,4.528942115768463

1408751,5,B000059PPO,"One of the most remarkable stories you will ever see on film, and filmmaker Herzog is a masterful storyteller, deftly weaving interviews in numerous locations with reenactments to show not just the effects of events on his subject, but the sheer, raw drive to survive in the face of utterly inhuman actions and circumstances.

1408758,4,B000059PPO,"A great compliment to the movie ""Rescue Dawn"" (2007).  This documentary is about the only US/Vietnam-era POW to successfully escape (read Dengler's story in ""Escape From Laos"").  The childish title doesn't do justice to the story.  Werner Herzog did a great job on this documentary--going on-locations to film the scenes and using realistic recreation of events by hiring locals.  The story includes references to Eugene DeBruin, a fellow POW.  In ""Rescue Dawn,"" DeBruin was unjustly cast as a bad character.  In fact, DeBruin sacrificed his chance at freedom by staying behind to care for an ill fellow escapee.  This documentary places DeBruin in the correct characterization.  Herzog illustrated how incredibly difficult the terrain and weather was for Dengler's escape, and the consequences of capture and execution.  I especially appreciated the touching epilog about Dieter's Arlington burial--rich with the full US Navy military burial honors.  This is a fitting documentary about an amazing man.",1381363200,3,1003,5.496732026143791

Dieter's official debrief was the recommended reading for all the ""newby"" aircrew guys who wanted to know the story of the only American pilot who escaped POW captivity and returned to friendly hands.  Dieter's two fellow American prisoners are still unaccounted for, although the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command continues the search.  I knew Dieter only through correspondence with him after the event, and he puts his heart into telling his amazing story!

The master storyteller does not disappoint here.  To elaborate on almost any part of this incredible story could spoil it for someone who hasn't seen it. As is the case with all of his documentaries Herzog narrates the film. I find his voice to be riveting; able to express humanity and empathy even when referencing mans inhumanity to man.

1408776,4,B000059PPO,"Werner Herzog turned out an gripping documentary when he made Little Dieter Needs to Fly. This fine documentary tells the true story of Dieter Dengler who went through h*ll after being shot down in his plane while on a mission during the Vietnam War. While this isn't exactly a pretty story, the film moves along at a good pace. The cinematography is excellent and Herzog went to great lengths to recruit native Asian men (in Laos) who essentially act out some of the things his torturers did to him when he was their prisoner.

When the movie starts, we quickly learn that Dieter was only a small child when he watched helplessly as Allied planes nearly crashed into his bedroom window when they made air raids on Germany during World War II. While this certainly could have caused Dieter to avoid aviation, it had the opposite effect: Dieter wanted more than anything to be able to fly a plane. When he was eighteen, Dieter left Germany to immigrate to America; and he learned to fly. He was also drafted into the air force during the Vietnam War; and the majority of this film has Dieter telling us his story so we know what he experienced as a prisoner of war held by the Vietcong.

What happened to Dieter is so terrible it's a small miracle he survived. Actually, I take that back--it's a HUGE miracle that he survived. I don't want to spoil too much of it for you but I will say that his captors were so cruel I haven't seen anything like it except for the Nazi concentration caps during World War II. His stories about the exact nature of his torture, the prison camp where he was held and a planned escape are harrowing to say the least. There's another amazing story of him and a buddy almost going over a monstrous, crushing waterfall on a raft; they just managed to escape death that day, too.

I won't tell you how Dieter ultimately found freedom; it's very poignant and a stunning tale that I won't forget anytime soon.

My only disappointment is that, as others have noted, we know next to nothing else about Dieter Dengler. True, Dieter tells us that he learned to be a blacksmith and that he toiled hard hours as an apprentice; but we honestly learn little else about him except for a very quick view of his current home outside of San Francisco where he hoards tons of food to make sure that he never has to go hungry again. The film essentially remains a tale of Dieter's experiences as a prisoner; there is little said about his childhood and nothing at all is said about his current personal life except that he likes to open and close doors so that he doesn't feel trapped like he was when he was brutally tortured.

Overall, Little Dieter Needs to Fly hit me over the head like a ton of bricks; this story is all THAT shocking and horrific. It's a real testament to Dieter's strength that he lasted through everything that came his way. I certainly wouldn't have lasted through all that; I tip my hat to Dieter Dengler!",1253145600,,2942,4.481343283582089

German Boy is a wonderful book on how it was for a small German boy, little Dieter (Dieter Dengler), to grow up in post war Germany.

When I started watching this movie, I had no idea that the Little Dieter in the title was, in deed, the little boy in German Boy.

Hertzog's style is in all its full glory in this film. I like the jumps back and forth in time, and the way Hertzog takes Dieter back to the very places he was captive so that Dieter can say exactly how he felt at the time.

It was rather touching the way Dieter told one of the Laotian's that it was okay, comforting him, and trying to keep him from being afraid.

Such a caring man.

BTW, there was a feature film made about Dieter Dengler's experiences when he was shot down in his U.S. Navy AD-6 Skyraider, also produced by Hertzog, called ""Rescue Dawn"" which actually dramatically demonstrates all the things Dieter Dengler went through as a captive including his friend getting his head chopped off.

While I had not heard of Dengler before watching this film, I've read several first-hand prisoner-of-war accounts from the Vietnam War and found Herzog's documentary not only intriguing but revealing of the man who went through those horrible experiences.  That was a unique dimension that heightened my interest in the film and my appreciation of Herzog as a director.

This is the first of Herzog's films/documentaries that I had seen, and it whetted my appetite for more of his work.  I think it's much better than Rescue Dawn, starring Christian Bale although I enjoyed that one too.

1408784,5,B000059PPO,"Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see. Yes, we see the violence and the heroism, but as The Fog Of War brought us into the mind of one of last century's foremost warmongers, this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy, tortured, and ultimately triumphs. Except, in no way, shape, nor form, is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it. Nor is Little Dieter Needs To Fly's titular subject, Dieter Dengler, and immigrant German who survived the depredations of the Nazis (we find out, as example, that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only man not to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for that stand) post-World War Two Germany, and his own imprisonment at the hands of the Vietcong, when his Air Force jet was shot down over Laos on February 1st, 1966.... While the title of the film, and the idea of Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, stirred by the impression Allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town, as a child, make one believe that Dengler is the central subject of the film, this is not true. The subject is Dengler's survival, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and staid an aspect to interest Herzog. Nor is the fact that he won a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C., and the Navy Cross. That thing which pushed Dengler to survive so much, and remain such a relatively upbeat man (although there are glimpses of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and all of Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler's `distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully ripened Herzog Country, and the use of a Madagascan chant, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, show Herzog is, perhaps along with only Martin Scorsese, the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!",1221350400,,2442,4.527149321266968
1408785,4,B000059PPO,"Well, it's Herzog. Expect anything. On the surface, this film seems to tell a fairly straightforward story about a young pilot shot down over Laos during the Vietnam War and escaping the captors who have taken him prisoner as a POW. During the election campaigns of 2008, it's difficult not to watch this film without thinking of John McCain, who must have had similar experiences. Meanwhile, if you know anything about PTSD, you are wondering constantly if what you are witnessing is a man recovered from the trauma of his captivity (and his youth in post-war Germany) or a patchwork of adaptive behaviors that mask a deep and profound disorder. We do not learn (unless I missed it) that Dengler was married three times and then died only a few years later from ALS. He talks nonstop in almost machine-gun fashion, referring to himself in the third person, his life seeming to have turned a long time ago into an adventure story that he has told many times before.

I sense that Herzog is immersing us in the ambiguities of all this, while making no judgments of his own, as if this man's story is so outside the norm that nothing can really be said conclusively about it that would be in the least bit more illuminating than what he captures with the camera and then edits together. What potential material, for instance, was not recorded, and what was excluded from the final cut? and how many different movies could Herzog have made out of all his footage? These are questions that apply to any documentary, but they cry out to be asked of this one. The re-enactments in the jungle with men playing the role of his captors need some context that Herzog does not provide. As Dengler hugs and reassures one of the men as they sit together, you marvel at who these other men are and what the making of this film could have meant to them. Herzog reveals nothing.

The last scene, appropriately an aerial shot, is pure Herzog in its ambiguity. On one level it is clearly a boy's dream come true. On another it overwhelms with the implications that come with an adult's understanding of the immense cost of of war. Then there is simply the breathtaking panorama of what seems to be a mothballed landscape of grounded aircraft. The film is worth seeing for its extraordinary view of how a single human life can be shaped by one extremity after another. How many stars do you give that? I'm not sure.",1221264000,,2396,4.595794392523365

1408787,5,B000059PPO,"From a childhood in post-war Germany, Dieter Dengler saw a plane buzz his window.  He immediately knew his goal in life was to be a pilot.

At the age of 18, Dieter left Germany for America.  With nearly nothing, his pockets and stomach empty, he joined the US military with promises of becoming a pilot.  He soon learned that his dreams of flying would be postponed while he was assigned to odd jobs.  Without being deterred, Dieter got the education necessary to become a pilot, thereby fulfilling his dream.  Little did he know the freedom of flight that had brought about great joy would also serve as the catalyst for the harrowing nightmare of being shotdown during a mission in Vietnam, and eventually becoming a POW.

The heart of the story is the very detailed account of how he was downed, with the explosions and blinding lights, and his subsequent capture.  It's amazing the difficulties a POW has to endure, and until articulated firsthand, it's nearly impossible to truly empathize.  Dealing with psychological torment and various forms of torture like a bags of ants over his head, the vivid explanations and details of how Dieter survived - along with a few fellow prisoners - is not only nearly impossible to fathom, but spell-bindingly mermerizing.  The dysentery tale is particularly cringe-worthy.

During one brief stretch, some U.S. survival guide footage is displayed for almost comical purposes.  It's sad how out-dated and nearly worthless the tips were, and reinforced the old thought that military leaders learn how to fight the previous enemy just in time for a new, different enemy.  It's no surprise that Dieter and many others were captured.

With little emotion or transition, Dieter easily sways from demoralized captive to lethal wisp, managing to kill several guards during an escape attempt shootout.  How he survived is anyone's guess.  With a loss of contact from all but one other prisoner, mangled feet carrying his emaciated body through the jungle during torrential downpour of the monsoon season, and head to toe coverage in mud, blood, and leeches, it would be understandable, maybe even forgivable, if he had simply given up and allowed death to take him.  As Dieter mentions, however, it is ironic that in his most dire moments, his only friend and companion was a bear that wanted to eat him, and since that moment never came, death just didn't seem to want him.

In the end, one has to wonder if the various reenactments and the heartfelt story has done anything to assuage the demons eating at Dieter Dengler.  Countless years after he was shot down and tortured, he doesn't appear any worse for the wear.  There is, however, his vivid memory of the events, as well as his candid story-telling ability.  There is no doubt of post-Vietnam stress and nightmares that must haunt him and other former POWs on a daily basis.  It's fortunate that Dieter's story was made before his recent passing, and it's a superb lasting legacy for such a courageous hero.",1216166400,,3001,4.900990099009901

1408801,5,B000059PPO,"More than anything else, Werner Herzog is drawn to extremes of passion and intensity, situations where people are pushed to the breaking point.  In the unforgettable Fitzcarraldo, he showed us a protagonist so consumed by his vision he seemed capable of anything.  (Herzog demonstrated this same quality during the production of that masterpiece.)  Grizzly Man introduced us to the demented and delusional Timothy Treadwell, whose ""suicide by bear"" provided a cautionary tale about hubris and narcissism.  Although also a documentary, Little Dieter Needs To Fly is very different from, and superior to, Grizzly Man.  Indeed, the men are almost polar opposites.  Treadwell is annoying, insane, and ego-driven.  Dengler, by contrast, has achieved something almost inconceivable and yet retains a charming modesty, candor, and matter-of-fact view of himself and his life.

To be fair, LDNTF paints on a much larger canvas than GM.  From the ragged end of WWII in Germany, where Dieter first becomes fixated on flight, to the late 60s bombing of Vietnam, Dengler's life is caught up in the sweep of history.  He speaks without passion of stripping wallpaper from bombed buildings, boiling it, and eating the glue.  Like so many others, at 18 he took his dream to the U.S. and, after much determined hard work, became a citizen, a college graduate, and a Navy pilot.  Herzog secured superb documentary footage throughout, which is carefully pieced together with bridges of Dengler speaking.  The film flows seamlessly, music is used exceptionally well, and Herzog does not push an agenda - he is simply telling a man's story, or, more properly, letting him tell it.

To say Dengler led an astonishing life doesn't do it justice.  His plane was shot down over Laos, miraculously he survived the crash.  (On return he would later survive four more!)  He was quickly captured and routinely tortured, indeed, torturing him became a sort of party game.  Later he was taken to a prison camp where conditions were so deplorable that catching and eating a rat was considered a real luxury.  During monsoon season he and some other inmates managed to escape, he alone lived to talk about it.  He watched his only companion get decapitated.  Ultimately he was rescued.  This is the stuff of legend; this is the stuff of superheroes.  But Dieter Dengler recounts these mind-boggling events easily, candidly, openly.  It is this self-effacing quality that makes Dengler so profoundly interesting, and appealing.  Really, when all is said and done, Dengler was a kid that wanted to fly - the idiotic politics and hate that foot the bill for airplanes were irrelevant to him.  A stunning film about an unforgettable man.",1202601600,13,2701,5.095671981776765

1408803,5,B000059PPO,"Werner Herzogs's War documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly, is an interview with a provocative background of film imagery. The subject is the German-American pilot, Dieter Dengler, and his experience as a prisoner of war in the jungles of Vietnam that he explains was like that of being in a dream.

And German filmmaker, Werner Herzog, has crafted a film-retelling of Dieter's story that suggests the presence of Dieter's subconscious world of dreams.  The documentary looks naturalistic, in that parts of the documentary include authentic film footage from the Vietnam conflict and much of the interview is filmed in the actual jungle setting of Vietnam and Dieter's captivity is re-enacted with real Vietnamese people who play along as his tormentors.  But artistically, Herzog's film makes the natural world into an abstract and challenges our perceptions of reality.

The Vietnamese folk music is juxtaposed against images of villages being napalm-bombed. The singing voice, in the context of Dieter's experience that he called an ""abstract world"" becomes an angry, buzzing sound, as if Dieter's memory and narrative are unable to process his deepest nightmares.

Herzog's film images and sounds are linked organically to the story, but his techniques assert that reality exists below the surface of rational thought.  Film images of a hungry bear and a corpse-like dummy pilot become metaphors for death that function as instruments of film poetry. The hungry bear that pursued him, Dieter believed, represented death, which he says, intended to eat him. The U.S. NAVY's archival film footage of the dummy pilot being disassembled, in the context of the story about a pilot who is tortured physically and spiritually, also becomes an abstract of death, a plastic symbol, a corpse-like, hollow, cannibalized pilot.

And the buzzing sound of the Vietnamese folk music returns later when he speaks of his nightmare in which ""the entire navy"" is looking for him. The buzzing music is juxtaposed with the absurd image of a single canoe, filled with quickly rowing Vietnamese villagers--and he becomes a man tormented in nightmarish isolation.  When Dieter explained his rescue, he said the smell of gasoline awakened him to reality. The ethereal substance that produces vapor mirage and napalm death and that awakened him was emitting from the engine of a U.S. spotter plane.

The strange and otherworldly sound of the Asian folksong became the voice of Dieter's inner demons. And the theme of human endurance becomes ambiguous, as Dieter's survival, his triumph, is linked to the misery of nightmares.

At the end of the segment called ""Punishment,"" Dieter reflects on his experience and says, ""The only heroes are dead,"" and also states, ""Death did not want me."" Dieter said that his experience as an impoverished and suffering German boy in a bombed-out, post-world-war Germany prepared him for suffering, and Herzog opens the film with actual footage of the napalm bombing of Vietnamese villages and suggests that the Vietnamese guns, which swivel and shoot into the sky, are mute in comparison to Dieter's bombs. We wonder whether Dieter believes the torture he endured was deserved and is full of acceptance for his ""punishment"". Even years later, Dieter's past and present are linked. Night is still a haunting boundary against his daytime reality. His tattoo ""dream"" of white horses pursuing him is only realized in the Mott Davis Cemetery for aging, decommissioned fighter planes, primed with white paint.",1202256000,,3517,5.253119429590018

Herzog's films always have the sense of being impressionistic -- he throws the images up on the screen, and they may not always follow each other in a linear fashion, but they nearly always have a sustained, cumulative effect that, by the end of the film, is deeply emotional and troubling.
In this film, the good natured subject starts talking at the beginning and never stops -- Herzog has found someone perhaps even more voluble than he is -- and the audience is perfectly set up by his cheerful good naturedness and lucid observations, because by the end of the film we discover just how unimaginably damaged this person has been by life.  The unfolding final images of the film are completely striking in the usual Herzogian sense (if you've seen something like ""Lessons of Darkness"" you'll have some sense of what to expect), but the meaning is ambiguous: is this a kind of heaven for little boys that love to fly?
