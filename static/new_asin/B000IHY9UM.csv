2656069,4,B000IHY9UM,"Overall I found this DVD pretty fun for cardio, it kept my heart rate up and in a constant, steady sweat.  The ballet-sculpt segment was pretty good for (mostly lower body) muscle toning, esp. considering no dumbbells are needed.

I agree with the other reviewer that the moves aren't authentic dance but dance-based/-derived movements, which I can live with since it's a cardio workout first and dance second (yes, precision of form and movements are important, but moreso for sculpting and not so much for a cardio exercise).  The routines are pretty varied, but kept brief enough so that I remembered all the moves.

Not so much a con, but I found it funny that the jazz, latin & funk background music sounded pretty much the same with just a few nuances that are different.  Another nitpick is the backup performers aren't in sync with Denise's movements from time to time (you would think they'd at least take that out during editing!)

All in all a fun workout, but don't expect to get positive looks if trying to pull these off in a club.",1168473600,2,1045,4.6521739130434785
2656070,5,B000IHY9UM,"This workout DVD from Denise Austin is great! You have a 5 minute warm-up, three 10 minute dance routines, a 15 minute ballet sculpt segment, and a 5 minute cool down. You have the option of going through all the workouts, choosing them one at a time, or customizing your own workout in any order you like--which is a nice feature. The three dance workouts include latin, jazz & pop, and club.  The dance moves are really basic and great for beginners.",1168214400,4,452,4.512195121951219
2656071,5,B000IHY9UM,"I'm not always a fan of Denise Austin; - not because she's not a good instructor (because she's a pretty good instructor), but because she is way too over the top with extra cheesey enthusiasm and she can be too in your face.  Not this time however.  Sure she is still enthusiastic (I guess you need some personality), but this is better than usuall and it's a great and easy (yet effective) workout.

She also is an instructor that isn't always in sync with the beat of the music, which can be frustrating, but not so much this time.  It's a great dvd with four different types of cardio work.  You can do them in any order (the dvd lets you programm how you want to do it), and there is ballet toning, Latin, jazz and club funky aerobics.  It's nice to have a variation going.  In each segment, you start of simply and then slowly add on moves to make a longer combo.  Then there is a toning segment that is easy to follow and uses usual kind of moves like crunches, planks and plies etc.

I like this.  It's good for days when you want a bit of a lighter workout and if you are a beginner or intermediate.  If you are advanced you won't find this enough, but like me, it's good for the days where you can't be bothered with a tough routine.  I really enjoy it and if you are normally put off by Denise like I sometimes am, then don't worry, she is less overpowering here, but does an excellent job and you'll have fun with it I'm sure.",1166054400,166,1438,4.189090909090909

2656113,4,B000IHY9UM,"This DVD is decent. I'll admit, I've only done the three faster paced dance routines - Jazz, Latin, and Funk. I've not yet done the ballet. The routines are pretty good. Each one is ten minutes, but it's actually two five minute routines in one. I feel this keeps things fresh and makes the routine go by quicker. But, at the same time, while they're not super hard, it can feel like you barely just caught on before she's on to the next thing. She uses a lot of arm movements, so you really get a full body workout. But I feel she could push harder with the lower half. My biggest complaint is Denise Austin herself. Super sugary personality, more upbeat than I prefer. But overall, a decent workout.",1453161600,,701,4.4

2656150,5,B000IHY9UM,"I am not into kick boxing. I am not a man. I like the dance videos, but, it's hard to find a good dance video that's not too fast paced and hard to follow. Denise's video is perfect!  She has faultless cuing and even has a separate 5 min warm up before the dance routines and cool down section, PLUS, it comes with 4 different dance routines only 10 mins each! So you can do each one separate or all together or mix and match your favorites!  I love that the dances are only 10 mins each. Great for when I don't have time or am tired.

I have the 10 min trainer by Tony Horton and I can't really do it because unless you're pretty young it's difficult to perform many of those exercises for a baby boomer. I'm in my 50's.  I don't like getting down on the floor, too hard to get back up lol.  Denise's video is my version of the 10 min trainer that's perfect for me and no kickboxing which I hate! It's not so much the content and you have to make it so difficult but studies show it's the consistency that counts more to losing and keeping weight off and getting fit! Thanks Denise!

2656176,2,B000IHY9UM,If you can pick up moves quickly and don't need to watch the instructor then this is a good video.  The camera angles are bad for trying to learn the moves.

Love denise austin, she has an amazing attitude that's always genuine.  This is clearly an advanced workout, though obviously you can take your own breaks (which I did).  I got to about 40 minute and finished with my own cool-down.  I'm intermediate, and just the complexity of so many dance moves was both fun and daunting.  since it's called 'mix',lives up to it.

I liked the fact that the DVD was cut into segments and it allows you to piece together your workout allowing you to pick and choose which workout goes first second and so on. This is my first Denise Austin video and I was very unhappy with her over-zealous personality. It actually made me feel bad about myself....that is until I took a look at the content. The workouts themselves are pretty good and would work if she would take the time and actually instruct you on how to perform each move. I found myself having difficulty keeping up with the moves and then noticing how out of sync she was compared to the dancers in the back. The whole DVD seemed rushed and I was annoyed by her whisper quiet voice. Some other reviewers said this is one of her better DVDs? I think I'll stay away from the Denise Austin fan club. This will be put at the bottom of the stack of my exercise collection for when I want to mix it up, but won't be in heavy rotation.",1368662400,2,1031,4.26530612244898

I thought this would be a nice change except that I don't think it gives me a very good workout. It's okay to get the non-exerciser up and moving, but Denise's lack of helpful instruction concerns me if you aren't normally doing these moves. The dance moves are easy enough to keep up with, but the sculpting segment really ticks me off. For someone who is in pretty good shape and also does a decent amount of body-weight exercises (lunges, squats, etc) the moves seemed way too fast. I went through the motions but couldn't get the full effect because there wasn't enough time to get into the correct form/position. Same with the stretches - it doesn't stretch anything if you aren't holding any position. I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for a fun and effective workout...",1365206400,,965,4.551724137931035

This particular dvd has some interesting dance moves on it, but its definitely not professional choreography at all.

Each segment gets you moving so you will do cardio, and the moves actually repeat and build, so it is easy to pick up on after a few watches.  I would NOT buy this DVD to learn to dance, however; this is primarily an exercise video.

If you are unfamiliar with Denise Austin's style (perky and encouraging), check out one of her videos from the public library and see if you like her style.  This one is right in line with her style, so don't buy it if she annoys you.

My main problem with this video is the camera work.  Seriously, I don't like the cinematography on an exercise video.  Whoever was filming this was attempting to get ""artsy"" and tried several different angles and close/long shots.  This is while you are trying to do the video!  It was ridiculously hard to follow what was going on, and, at first before I became familiar with the moves, I had to stop exercising to determine what the next move was.  That is NOT supposed to happen on an exercise DVD.  Sure, you may have to stop to get the move right, but you shouldn't need to wait to get the camera angle to change so that you can actually see the move.

A short section teaching all the steps before the workouts would have helped me.

This one looked like it would be different and fun, but believe me it's not fun nor in any way challenging...it's just plain boring. The whole video was more or less a warm-up.
In all of her exercise videos it would be helpful if Ms. Denise would explain the benefits of each exercise move like Jane Fonda does.

2656289,4,B000IHY9UM,"This DVD is a fun way to get in a cardio workout, especially on days when it's hard to get motivated to do tougher programs.  It's not necessarily a difficult cardio program if you are at an intermediate level or above, but since the moves are different than some traditional aerobic programs, it's a good DVD to mix in with other videos during the week.  I am not a great dancer and usually have a hard time learning choreography, but this program was easy for me to follow.  I haven't tried the ballet toning segment yet, but the three cardio segments are fun to mix together for a thirty minute cardio workout.  It's a non-intimidating dance DVD that made me feel a little bit more comfortable about getting into dance.  I like Denise for her enthusiasm and positive attitude.  Some of the camera angles and cueing could have been better at times, but I think that's minor compared to the overall fun and effectiveness of the workout.  All in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed dancing to this program, and I like doing this in conjunction with toning programs and other cardio programs to get a nice variety.",1252195200,,1120,4.54228855721393

If you are looking for a real dance workout, then this is not the dvd for you, Denise doesn't dance that well so i often find my self looking at the people behind her for the moves, the moves themselves are more aerobic than dance, and i find them to be more ""upper body"" focused. So in general it has very simple, low impact routines but if you're just starting out they are effective. If you want a real dance workout go for something else.",1251417600,,594,4.219298245614035

It inludes warm up, cool down, and workouts in ballet, jazz, funk, and latin. It is fun and a good way to learn. Each workout changes constantly what muscles you are using so your muscles do not get bored. Sometimes I only have time for one. Today, I did 2 styles. Some of you might be up for doing all of them in one workout! Good for you! I don't have the time, but would like that.

The moves are easy, not terribly dance-y and didn't get my heart rate up enough to break a sweat. It's much more like a warm-up than a work-out, and I'm not a coordinated aerobics queen.

Her Hip Hop was soulless but perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the music. It's really much more like a rhythm machine playing background to a lounge act. For dance fun, I'd look to Donna Richardson, Kathy Smith, The Method, Crunch or the international series from Acacia.

All together, this is a fun workout that makes me-the relatively uncoordinated--feel like I am dancing, and pretty well too! Not that I am ready to challenge Justin Timberlake, but I am having fun. Denise is easy to follow, talks a whole lot (maybe a bit too much-says each step-""Single single double!""), the camera follows well, and the other folks look like they're having a blast.
A bonus for me is that each segment you can do seperately. I love doing other 30 minute workouts, and when I want to add a little extra, I can grab this Denise and have some fun.",1237248000,,825,4.5

Of course, it's more dance then aerobic, but if you have experience w/any past aerobic videos, you should be able to catch on w/these dance moves after a few tries.
It's a good idea to do the intros for each one, very informative and entertaining. I hate exercising, I'm not motivated easily and this puts the fun in exercising! AND, it's a great way to build cardio and lose weight.",1233187200,2,660,4.246031746031746

And she makes the dances fun on this DVD - she leads you through the steps of four main dance types which help raise your cardio rate and burn off some weight.  Each section has moves that she shows and builds upon and before you know it you are dancing (though I am not veery graceful at it.)

""Broadway"" style was OK. And the ""club"" moves? I have never seen anyone at a club dancing like that. If you want to look like a fool, by all means break out these moves at a club!
Denise Austin is by far the most annoying instructor I have ever seen. Too cheery, talks constantly, and keeps saying ""Arriba!"" and other ""motivating"" slogans. I don't like how all of the exercisers are 20-somethings with perfect bodies (the kind you can only get with the help of a surgeon). Why not show people of different ages, and different body types?

I agree that its meant for a light workout.  I think the title is misleading, FAT BURNING?  You need a little more action for fat burning.
I think dance moves are not too difficult if you are not big into dancing.  You'll get it after trying 3-4 times.  But it does not have the retention factor, very generic and its pretty dull and doesn't take you to 3-4 times, because it gets boring.

Please realize that this is my first workout dvd on any type of dance.  Maybe, because it takes 2-3 tries to get the moves, I find this a little boring.  I think I prefer more of the kickboxing and sculpting videos that I have on me.  A dance video would have to be really entertaining and very effective for me to fit into my regime.",1223596800,,871,4.125

Maybe ladies over 50 will find it interesting (and in our days 50years old look better than the 30s), but sorry girls ..... what to say? if you really want to sweat, choose something else. I bought Cindy Crawfords work out, is not a dancing workout, but you really feel your muscles, and you really sweating.... is hard but you see the difference... or maybe jane fonda 80's aerobics are more fan.....

2656335,4,B000IHY9UM,"Bubbly as ever, Denise Austin presents a low intensity workout in three dance segments:  Jazz, Latin and Club/Pop.  The Jazz segments definitely is the most imaginative of the three, the moves and choreography seemingly more thought out.  This first segment is also the most fun of the three.  The Latin segment seems like she was struggling to come up with enough basic moves to fill the time allotted.  I must say, though, it's amusing to see Austin quietly tossing out 'ariba's here and there.  The Club segment is the weakest of the three and is quite repetitive.  Each segment can be done independently of the others or they can be done sequentially.

If you are looking for a basic workout to keep you moving and occupied for 30 minutes this one is great.  If you want a hardcore aerobic workout this will not be for you.  As well, if you prefer your emphasis to be on dance rather than funked up aerobics, this DVD will disappoint.  Of the ensemble assisting her through each segment it is clear who the two most natural or trained dancers are, and Austin is not one of them.  This is evident in her lack of clear instruction of dance moves, rather than just keeping you moving, and on her need to pop, bounce and be all around bubbly throughout.  That said, Austin has tendency to command the routine as she is doing it and not a few steps ahead, as other trainers do.  If that type of instruction annoys you will be very frustrated with her style.

All in all it's a fun DVD that will keep you moving.  Just don't expect any more from it than that.",1214524800,2,1557,4.448763250883392
2656336,5,B000IHY9UM,I love this DVD; as usual Denise is an energetic teacher constantly cuing you on when and how to move.  Make sure to view the entire program before practicing since there are numerous dance routines.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1212364800,,229,4.7

This video has 3 different styles of dance.  The jazz portion is fine, but not my favorite - and that's only because I have so much more fun on the urban dance and latin segments.

2656342,4,B000IHY9UM,"I enjoy this DVD and when I'm not motivated to do something more difficult, I pop it in. It's a lot of fun, but I would say it's a medium level intensity workout, with minimal sculpting to anything but the legs. I love the ballet sculpt section for my legs, but you do about 4 pushups and that's really it for arms. I'd like to see more arms and abs in the sculpting section.

This workout is 50 minutes long if you do the entire thing. The DVD is nice because if you don't have time you can cut things out and just do a few of the dances or cut out the cool down.

Denise can be a bit confusing the first time through the DVD but I urge you to watch it again and you'll catch on. It's not a tough workout, and if you're in great shape you probably won't even sweat, but it's a nice workout for days you want or need a little bit less activity but still want to work out.",1201651200,2,871,3.9152542372881354

2656364,4,B000IHY9UM,"This is a really fun workout.  It goes by really fast.  I love the option to choose the segments you want to do.  The latin dance is my favorite.  The ballet is very challenging, a solid 15 minutes of total body toning.  I have no dance experience and after about 2x I figured out the video pretty much.  My only complaint is that they are not always on perfect cue,maybe they rushed on the taping a little.  Normaly her DVD's are pretty tight.  Love the DVD anyway.  Lots of times it is hard to find 30 minutes of cardio with toning on 1 dvd, even Yoga Booty Ballet only does 20 minutes of cardio before the toning sections.  This is a total body workout in 55 minutes, for that I really love the DVD.",1200528000,,702,4.1716417910447765

What I like, is the variety of workouts and the abilities to mix and match based on your needs. The fact that its dancing makes it that much more interesting. I've been working out for a few years now, but it is great for anyone at any level who wants to work out, from the novice to the person who has been doing it for a long time.

The only workout that is a little more difficult is the ballet workout, but it's still not bad.

She is encouraging and fun and although what I do takes less than 1/2 hour, I feel like I got a decent workout at the end of it.",1198454400,3,643,3.9689922480620154

The individual dance segments build easily, and she does enough repeats of each move that you get a flow.  Austin isn't the greatest caller of moves.  She sometimes says one thing and does another, so that even her trained dancers mess up.  And she's just too perky, smiles too much at the camera, tells me too much how fabulously I'm doing, which is actually ridiculous in any of these videos but it usually works better.

I didn't want to use garden variety old-fashioned aerobics videos, so 'dance' style cardio seemed like an awesome option. This video BLOWS. Denise could not be more annoying... I am a tolerant person, but I'd love to punch her! She talks in a weird sultry sex-kitten tone the entire time, and her encouraging remarks are absolutely ridiculous. It is just way too annoying. And she can't dance! Denise's rhythm is atrocious. In addition, there is no cuing whatsoever. How hard is it to give us a quick reminder of what step comes next? Or a count of how many times we are doing each segment? They also move very quickly through the dance moves... I'm not ultra-coordinated, so it was extremely frustrating. I did start to catch on after using this DVD for the 3rd time, and felt more comfortable with the moves, but the bottom line is I really thought the moves were stupid, and didn't have fun doing it. It just wasn't FUN. Most importantly, I didn't even come close to breaking a sweat. If it doesn't give me a workout, what's the point?",1188345600,9,1152,4.597087378640777

2656395,2,B000IHY9UM,"Denise Austin is not a dancer and it shows. She may be the instructor, but the talented dancers behind her are doing a better job of dance movement that is pleasing to the eye.

Better dance videos provide instruction in a ""mirror"" format so they are easier to follow.  For example, the instructor leads with his/her left foot, but cues you to use your right foot.  Denise does not do this.  She always leads with her right foot, which means that I have to lead with my left foot. It was awkward doing a dance video where I was taking off on my left foot all of the time.  Perhaps left-handers would like this video.  Most professional dance video let the audience lead with their right foot when learning new steps.

This is a mediocre addition to an industry collection of dance videos.  Denise's instruction is also poor in that she does not give adequate cues for what she is going to do next.  Even the dancers behind her sometimes had a difficult time following her lead.  Also, the camera work is sometimes lacking when Denise is teaching a step and the camera shot is from the waist up.

As far as the workout goes, it is a low impact, low-medium cardio routine.  Also be warned that Denise does some floor work near the end of the video.  I've got four dance videos now and this is my least favorite.",1184716800,15,1309,4.404166666666667

The cardio is fun on this workout as long as you don't watch Denise.  The cardio is great for a change of pace and for light days.  Adding in some jumping jacks between chapters and during the ""walk it out"" times definately helps to get your heart rate up.  The sculpting leaves some to be desired but has potential.  I have gotten much better results by doing that twice, and reversing the sides for the second time, so I can get an even workout on both sides.  She isn't very informative on form on this segment or on any in this one.  I have liked the fact that she puts stretch segments in her workouts, I just wish in this one that she would actually give time to do all the streches, not just a couple of them.  I just ignore the repition and hit the pause to hold in most cases.  She does give some different ways to stretch out which is nice. Her older workouts are better.",1182211200,2,922,4.169491525423729

However, I sort of just eat what I want when I want and gained several un-wanted pounds that need to go.  This is a great workout for anyone.

It works every area of your body and the BODY SCULPT (Ballet) part is not like taking ballet but it is very beneficial to all of us.  Now that one is probably the hardest of the 4 for me but I will evetually get it.  I have just ordered her Boot Camp DVD to help me also, especially when it is raining.  It says that she has kickboxing and other physical things in it to help with strength training and I feel like that one will help me with my drama practices also.  We have many physical dramas to where we are standing one moment and in the floor next and then back up and then down again and then push-ups and then kicks and so forth.  They are very good exercise as well.  However, with the un-wanted wait that I have gained it was very difficult for me to raise my legs and clap under them (for the dramas) and since I have added more  exercise (walking, Dance Mix) into my daily life and of course 128 oz. of water and no other forms of drink except a glass of milk I have made much progress.  I have began to loose my weight and I can now raise my leg and clap for the dramas.  This is great for me.  I would recommend you to try this DVD if you really enjoy dancing.  It is fun and a great workout!",1178755200,2,1820,4.016713091922005

I gave her the benefit of the doubt after buying the boot camp one and thought maybe she'd do better with this one since it's a different style...but it was just as horrible.  Her voice and how she uses it is aggravating, she's clumsy and doesn't instruct well, you have no idea what she's doing next.  I didn't make it through the whole thing, not because I couldn't phsyically, but mentally I just couldn't tolerate her anymore.  It wasn't energizing like a dance video should be.  Any time I dance I feel energized to keep dancing, but with this I just felt annoyed by her.

This DVD wasn't hard to do and it has variation which is nice and helps to keep your interest perked, especially for us 'older'ladies.  Kind of a pick and chose type of thing.

The jazz routine is pretty fun, but the Latin and 'club funk' are lame.  I do not recommend attempting these moves outside your living room.  The music is an afterthought:  synth tunes reminiscent of elevator music will not help you get into the routines.  The 'ballet' is just a generic sculpt routine, except the squats are referred to as plis.  Actually, there are several instances when Denise refers to first position as pli, which is rather amusing. It is pretty clear that she does not have a dance background.  Moreover, this is not even a very good workout.  I hardly broke a sweat, and I'm not in particularly stellar shape.  There a plenty of workouts that are more fun and more effective.",1174089600,3,863,4.5816993464052285

2656458,3,B000IHY9UM,I own one other Denise Austin DVD (Yoga & Pilates-Love It!). I agree with some of the other reviews; there is not much queueing and the camera angles are weird. I think they had to edit it that way because Denise or one of the other dancers were out of synch. Denise is all over the place in this workout. If you focus on the guy in the back or the woman to the left of Denise then the moves will make more sense to you. It got my heart rate up.

Most of the time, I don't want to get motivated to do anything. If you're like me, you will LOVE this workout. It is not difficult to follow. Denise Austin's dance moves are very well-explained and she is extremely understanding and compassionate. The dance moves are really fun. I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to ""dance,"" but they're more graceful moves than dance moves, which I really appreciate because I find that whole monotonous movement thing in exercise really....BORING. There is nothing monotonous or boring about these dance moves. She makes it really fun and exciting. The music pumps you up and makes you want to move. I'm actually excited to exercise which is a first for me. What I love about the dance programs is that they are short 10-minute bursts. Each 10 min. segment is a different theme--latin, club funk, jazz, ballet etc. I was also afraid that I wouldn't like certain genres, but I did!  Becuase they are short and sweet, it keeps things interesting for you.  Also, you can customize the order of the programs.

I would recommend this to anyone...it honestly does NOT matter what age you are. I'm a complete weakling when it comes to exercise and I found these exercises to be energizing and effective...and not difficult at all!

The only segment that is a little challenging is the ballet section because she has you doing push ups for a very short period of time. I can't do push ups. So, I just skip that part. :) But the rest of the ballet program is great.",1171584000,64,1659,4.613559322033899
2656461,5,B000IHY9UM,I really enjoy doing this dvd. It actually keeps you going and Denise Austin really makes you want to get up and dance.

I make this part of my daily routine and love the happy 'never give up' message Denise provides. I like to follow Denise and from time to time the back up dancers who all display the happy, energetic message Denise conveys. Denise and her dancers clearly demonstrate the routines and within a few days I was handling these exercises and dance moves well. Attitude is sooo important for motivating my exercise routine and I find Denise and these girls so friendly and inspirational. My favourite segment is the warm-up where I exercise with the three of your smiling faces. This is how I begin my working day!",1170979200,3,736,4.896
2656463,3,B000IHY9UM,"While I found this DVD to be a good workout, it was unfortunately mostly a rework of a lot of the dance moves she uses in previous workout tapes. I have a lot of her earlier videos, and she uses the same steps, but just in different categories. If this is your first Denise Austin DVD, then it is a really good low impact workout; there is minimal jumping which is good for people with bad backs or knees. However, if you have some of her other tapes, then this is not a good investment. The best part of the workout is the ballet sculpting set which features towards the end of the disc and contains new material.",1170720000,11,614,4.211864406779661

I've been doing this DVD for a couple weeks and haven't gotten sick of it yet. I purchased 4 DVD's and this is my favorite. The moves are fun and as you get more familiar/comfortable with the routine you can add your own style and flair.

Denise's miscuing didn't bother me at first (actually I didn't really notice), but I have the more I do the DVD. Even so, this is still my favorite DVD.

If you are looking for a workout that will get you dancing and sweating, this is the one for you. I especially like that the routines (10 min each) move quickly to keep your heart rate up. I hate when the steps are broken down too much and too slow - its not a workout then. This workout is great!!!",1170720000,28,819,4.1125

However, this is perfect for what I was looking for.  I found it difficult in the beginning, but the good thing about a DVD is that you can do it over and over.  To me it's great exercise that's fun and not boring.  I actually like her lightheartedness and carefree way that makes it more fun.  My favorite is the club funk segment, especially the second dance number.  I have a blast doing it.

I haven't really gotten into the ballet, dance sculpt.  That's the only one that really seems difficult because she doesn't go into it slowly and do it move by move so you can get discouraged.",1170460800,4,751,4.35251798561151

overall, the workout was fun and up beat. the camera moves around A LOT in the latin groove, jazz& pop and club funk...the camera is all sideways and not showing the leg movements but if you can get past all that and the cuing problems the ballet sculpt is a GREAT workout, especially the lunges.",1169337600,,674,4.392

Each dance segment is interesting in and of itself--and it moves quickly, which is nice. There's 2 combinations in each of the 3 main dance/cardio sessions (jazz, latin, funk). There's also a nice ballet workout that focuses on stretching and toning.

I'm a Denise Austin fan and own a number of her other workouts. She's very light and supportive (although in one of the dance segments she keeps telling the viewer to ""have fun!"" which, although a staple instructor line, can be annoying: Yes, I get the whole idea that I shouldn't be loathing every second of my workout, but on the other hand--it IS a workout, and I figure as long as I do the best I can and get a workout, THAT is the most important thing, not to ""have fun."")

This is a fun workout that I enjoy and am incorporating into my own routines.  I never thought I could do hip-hop style dancing, but Denise makes it easy to follow.  The latin and jazz combos are a blast!  If you are at a beginner to intermediate level and enjoy learning simple dance routines, you will enjoy this.",1169078400,7,582,4.495238095238095

Thus, I found this to be an okay set of three (or maybe it's four) 10-minute sessions, plus a warm-up and cool-down as well.  Kind of funny to me that one of the other reviewers said most of the dance sections were easy with the exception of the one on ballet.  I haven't looked at the ballet one yet, since that's really not my thing ... but I found the other sections to be pretty advanced for me ... they were going from one move and adding on others too quickly for me to be able to catch on and participate ... I'm sure that with more practice I will probably be able to figure out all the moves, but I'd say if you're a beginner (at exercising or dancing) that you may get a little frustrated by the quick pace.  I also wish the camera would have captured more of the footwork in some parts, as it helps me to be able to see that.  I didn't have any problems with Denise's ""form"" or the others - probably because I don't have form myself :-)  I think this is a good DVD, especially for the price, if you are: A) familiar with/okay with Denise and her perky voice and style; B)looking for some short sessions (10 minutes each not counting the warmup and cooldown)to give you some variety in your exercise options.",1169078400,,1352,4.22093023255814

I don't know WHAT Denise Austin is doing but it sure isn't dance. The ""Broadway"" section especially was a total joke. You can't see her feet, she doesn't explain correct body positioning and as a dancer....well, a dancer she ain't. She kept shouting at us to do ""Fosse"" arms but what she was doing was some strange aerobic arm-flailing.

The DVD did keep me moving and did raise my heart rate but I felt utterly embarrassed doing what she called ""dance""! She also talks NONSTOP in a perky, cheery voice that comes across as totally fake and it was very very unnerving to be constantly told to ""do it with attitude.""

I guess I just like my exercise clear and crisp and to the point with no additional unnecessary theatrics...and when I buy a DVD that promises I can ""dance"" I'd like it to at least in some way resemble real dancing.",1168992000,7,1024,4.407407407407407
2656473,3,B000IHY9UM,"I agree with most of what the other reviewers said about this video.

First of all, you have to like Denise Austin's quirky personality or you will find yourself reaching for the mute on your remote.  She is very over-the-top, but atleast that is consistant with the other videos I've seen of her.

Secondly, like one of the reviewers said, the movements were not well executed... and at many times, the backup exercisers will ""mess up"" a movement.  That in itself wasn't so distracting, they are human after all, but there is one lady in the video that may become a complete distraction and annoyance to you as she did to me.  She is to the left of Denise, with short chestnut hair, and she seems to be fighting for the camera with Denise, by outdoing her in the exercises lol...

I think what annoyed me the most is that the 'dance' segments were much too simplistic and then BAM out comes the ballet toning segment which goes way too fast. Denise is hardly encouraging with the ""Do your best!"" comments when I'm struggling to not hurt my knees with the lunge/plie transitions lol.

I give this video 3 stars because it was very good for getting my heart pumping, and the ballet workout seems decent enough, but I probably could have jumped from couch to couch in my livingroom and gotten the same workout.",1168473600,4,1308,4.540425531914893

Plus the camera man was so focused on looking at the girls hair and make up, that I  couldn't see their feet to see what they were doing.
