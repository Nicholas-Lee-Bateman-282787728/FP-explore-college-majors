2769100,5,B000NIVNSW,"Haven't seen season 5 yet since I don't have ""The N"" on my cable package and have to wait for all things Degrassi to hit DVD.  However, if it's even half as good as seasons 1 through 4, it's gonna be a 6+.  This has been, without a doubt as far as I'm concerned, THE BEST and most realistic television series on the air EVER!  It all started with ""Degrassi Jr. High"" in the mid 80's, turned into ""Degrassi High"" after that, and then took a 13 year hiatus between the time the character ""Spike"" had her baby and her daughter, Emma, became a 6th grader.  I sent my 13 year old niece all of the original & next generation DVD's and apparently she has become the most popular girl in school because not only does she have the ""coolist uncle"" around, but they  (the other kids) are actually learning from this show!  Real world, Real life, Real situations.",1178841600,11,851,4.320754716981132

2769121,5,B000NIVNSW,Degrassi is an awesome show I've always been a fan and always will be. I grew up with it :),1395705600,,91,3.6
2769122,5,B000NIVNSW,I didn't know that all the seasons of Degrassi were on Amazon prime whenever I purchased it but it totally makes it worth it! i would have purchased prime just for the unlimited Degrassi marathons i get now :),1392681600,,209,4.384615384615385
2769123,5,B000NIVNSW,Definitely was one of my favorite shows when I was younger. So glad that I'm able to watch it again!,1391299200,,100,4.05
2769124,5,B000NIVNSW,"The episodes are short (less than 30 minutes) so, by default, they don't go deeply into some of the topics.  However, they do cover relevant issues for teens nowadays:  bullying (by other students as well as by teachers), drug use and abuse, teen sex and pregnancy, gender identity and discrimination, to name just a few.  It's filmed in Canada, so there does not appear to be much in the way of censorship.  That said, they cover the topics without nudity, without profanity, but they do get the point across.  I watch it with my teen, and it has led to many conversations about how to handle these situations when they crop up (and you know they will!).  I highly recommend this series to anyone with late middle school or early high school kids.",1390867200,,748,4.586466165413534

2769140,5,B000NIVNSW,I remember watching Degrassi Jr High back in 1980? as a High School student and liking the show then being mad when it disappeared from TV.  I started watching Degrassi again totally by accident and this is among my all time favorite episodes along with Time Stands Still. This episode centers on the opening of a Kevin Smith movie and the relationship that comes out of that night between Paige and Alex along with the reaction of some classmates. I thought this episode was well done and Lauren Collins and the girl playing Alex did a great job.,1316217600,,547,4.581632653061225
2769141,5,B000NIVNSW,"I loved season 5, it was one of my favorite seasons. I just loved Manny, Spinner, the beginning of Palex, and sadly enough the end of Jimmy and Hazel. Its a good buy and reminds you of how good degrassi used to be before they start being all about shock value.",1305158400,,260,4.117647058823529
2769142,5,B000NIVNSW,"I have never really watched Degrassi when it first aired, until one day I watched it at a relatives house, and since then I fell in love with it. So I decided to catch up with all the things that's been going on and I'm getting to know all who is who by purchasing from Amazon and I'm just enjoying all my Degrassi dvds and I'm still purchasing them until I get them all.",1288915200,,371,4.027027027027027
2769143,5,B000NIVNSW,"In this season, a lot of more stuff happens. Emma deals with Anorexia, Paige has troubles with her sexuality with Alex. Spiner is allowed to come back to school and makes a new friend Darcy, Manning acting career is ruined and Peter does something bad to ruin her reputation, Jimmy tries to get back into basketball, Elie becomes the new drummer for downtown sasquatch and Later Elie gets closer to Jimmy, Mr. Simpson cheats on his wife Spike. Jay and Silent Bob make two more apperances
J.T gets Liberty pregant and gets a job to support them, Later J.T even overdoses on prescription medicene. Jay and Alex gets starring credit, so does newcomer Peter and Mrs. Hatzilakos. Alex, Elie, Marco, Paige, Hazel and Craig graduate at the end of the season and Ashley returns at the end of the season",1231459200,,794,4.678571428571429
2769144,5,B000NIVNSW,"In my opinion, this is the best (and most dramatic) season of Degrassi yet, filled with everything you can possibly think of that a teenager might experience during their high school years. (I was a senior in high school when this season originally premiered so I know what I'm talking about!)

Season 5 starts off with the introduction of newcomer Peter (the principals son by the way) whom Emma has a desperate crush on, only to later find out that he wants Manny, her best friend. Manny is desperate to pursue a career in acting, and, after getting some pretty harsh criticism from a casting agent, decides to go so far as to get plastic surgery, much to the dismay of her very strict father, who refuses to let her become an actress and throws her out of the house after calling her a slut. A very upset Manny then goes to a party that Peter invited her to, gets drunk, and allows Peter to film her taking her top off. Manny begs Peter to delete the footage, but when she calls him a freak and refuses to date him, he emails the video to everyone at school, angering not only Emma, who is horrified that Manny did such a thing with the guy she likes, but also Paige who is disgusted by Mannys behavior and immediately throws her off the squad.  A distraught Manny begs Emma for forgiveness, and ends up moving in with her. She also begins dating Craig again, who is on his way to becoming a serious musician.

Now onto the other characters.

Liberty reveals to JT that she is pregnant, and they both eventually agree to keep the baby, and plan on moving out together. In order to move out, JT picks up more shifts at the Pharmacy he works at, but when he realizes that he won't be able to support Liberty and the baby with the amount of money he's making, he begins dealing drugs and when Liberty finds out what's he's been up to, she breaks up with him. Around that time, Libertys parents urge her to give the baby up for adoption once its born, and she agrees. Devastated by the news and by the break-up, JT overdoses on painkillers and lands in the hospital.

Meanwhile a friendless Spinner, who is still dealing with his guilt over the shooting (from season 4) meets good girl Darcy, who is part of friendship club, and after they start dating, Spinner vows to become a born again virgin (yeah right!)

Paige, who is stressing over getting into the college of her dreams, and is still dealing with her breakup with Matt, begins experimenting with her sexuality and is soon dating bad girl Alex.

Jimmy is dealing with being crippled and is trying to find out who he is when he realizes that he's no longer the basketball star he once was.

Emma begins to develop feelings for Peter yet again, who feels the same way about her, but is desperate to keep her feelings a secret from a still-very-angry-at-Peter Manny. During a school play, Emma and Peter sneak off for a makeout session...only to find her stepfather (aka Snake) and the school principal (aka Peters mom) kissing. A devastated Emma tells her mom, who kicks Snake out of the house, thus leading to Emmas bout with Anorexia. During this time, Manny becomes angry with Emmas change in behavior, which angers Emma, who eventually confesses that she's been dating Peter. All of this leads to Emma having a serious panick attack, which lands her in the hospital.

....etc. I guess now you get the point when I say its a very dramatic =) and definitely a must see!",1226016000,9,3427,4.487961476725522
2769145,4,B000NIVNSW,"this is just one of those shows that is great to watch marathon-style on a rainy day.  It takes you back to highschool with all the catty stuff that goes on.  As a girl, there were times i totally got into it and other times i made fun of it, because as an adult i know how stupid some of the stuff kids say really is.  But its one of those things you have in the back of the closet and watch when no one else is around...kinda like guys and porn.",1199059200,,447,3.8369565217391304
2769146,5,B000NIVNSW,"I love the cheesy escapism of this Canadian teen soap, in which every episode is A Very Special Episode.  Watch Manny pursue acting, Emma struggle with anorexia, Liberty and J.T. deal with possible parenthood, Craig make it big in music, Spinner try to redeem himself, Jimmy struggle with his identity post-parapalegia, Paige explore a different aspect of her sexuality, and Marco come out to his Dad.  And more.  The stories seem a little better fleshed out this season, perhaps because of the back work done in season 4.  In addition, the writing seems snappier and funnier, but I could have just been tired from being up all night with the baby;)  Pure escapist fun.  A guilty pleasure for those of us far past our high school days.",1188172800,7,735,4.748031496062992
2769147,5,B000NIVNSW,"This is one of my favorite shows. I have every season that is out, and I can't wait for Season 6 to come out on dvd. It shows teens in real situations, that I can more that relate to.",1187136000,,183,3.717948717948718
2769148,5,B000NIVNSW,"This is another great dvd box set of Degrassi!  My daughter and I are still loving the characters on this show.  It is very interesting to watch the trials and tribulations that this group of teenagers go through.
Highly recommended!",1185753600,4,233,4.8
2769149,3,B000NIVNSW,"In this season, you get to see growth within a few of the characters and also new challenges they have to face. Plus the development of characters we rarely got much of through the early years like Alex and Liberty. Paige goes through break ups, exploring her sexuality with a close friend, and a short hook up with an old beau.  Liberty is not the perfect, nerdy kid anymore as she becomes pregnant by her boyfriend JT.  JT also battles the upcoming pressures of becoming a teen dad.  Manny wants to be famous, but has a Girls Gone Wild moment that is all over the school.  But her on again-off again boyfriend Craig Manning comes back into the picture as they finally have a relationship.  Spinner also goes from being a bad boy to connecting with the Jesus.  We're introduced to three new characters Peter, Derek, and Danny.

My favorite moments through this season was Manny's drunkeness, the Paige and Alex relationship, and the JT and Liberty baby drama.

As for the extra disk, I was a bit disappoint at what I got for my money.  I'm very accustomed to commentaries that wasn't featured in this season.  Also the blooper reel and deleted scenes was a little boring.  Yet, maybe, if they would had added the minisodes the fourth disk would had been a big upgrade and worth the watch.

Nevertheless, don't buy the disk just for the extras.  The season is fairly good and whether interesting.  So if you're a Degrassi DVD collector it should be along side with all them.

Season rate - 3.5/5.0",1185062400,2,1497,4.575187969924812
2769150,3,B000NIVNSW,"I live for and have an odd obsession with Degrassi. I love it to death, and have even seen some of the actors in person twice!

That being said, although the episodes are phenomenal as EVER, the plotlines are a tad calmer compared to previous seasons. And I was really dissappointed that there were absolutely NO commentaries, because they were definately my favorite part of the Season 3 and Season 4 DVD sets. I honestly believe that if the leads and writers of the ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" episodes had done a commentary, it could have probably helped a lot of viewers who have struggled with their body image and/or an eating disorder.

On the other hand, the bloopers were hysterical with a lot of funny moments from Cassie Steele. And the deleted scenes seemed like they may have included some alternate plot twists. But one thing that I found odd about one of the deleted scenes is that Manny supposedly borrowed that ""look at me"" silver sequinned mini skirt from Emma, to wear to Craig's wedding gig in ""Weddings, Parties, Anything.""

The interview with Cassie Steele wasn't too revealing, and seemed almost repetitive. And the auditions of the new full-season cast members almost make one wonder how horrible the other people who auditioned must have been, or perhaps which acting school whipped the new additions into shape before shooting comenced. 0.0

Overall, I was happy with this DVD set, because it's an addition to my collection, but I wasn't thrilled by it. I personally enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Degrassi-The-Next-Generation-Season-3/dp/B000CNGBVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Degrassi The Next Generation - Season 3</a>&nbsp;DVD set the most because it included humorous and serious commentaries, hilarious bloopers, deleted scenes, and Degrassi Karoke!!! =)

Hope this helped!",1184889600,,1850,5.454545454545454
