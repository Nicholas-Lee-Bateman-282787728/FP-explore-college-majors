1973969,5,B00015Y0EG,"Babylon 5 is a five mile long space station.  Located deep in neutral territory, it is designed to prevent intergalactic war by providing a place where peace can be worked out between the races.  Run by Earth, it was built with help from the Minbari after our war with them when we were almost wiped out.  Since it is also a trade station, it attracts allies of all kinds on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, it also attracts trouble.  There are raiders in the area, the Narn and Centauri have at best a fragile peace, and someone is always trying to smuggle something on board.  Even worse, an ancient enemy is rebuilding forces, and the effects of this will reach all the way back to Earth.
Babylon 5 is still unique in television.  It set out to tell a single story that had been mapped out beforehand.  As a result, it sucks you in and doesn't let you go until you've reached the end.  Season 1 is the most uneven, but the beginnings of the story are there, and it lays the background on the races and cultures we will be dealing with over the course of the show.  Season 2 brings a new captain and a storyline that is gaining speed,  season 3 brings surprises and increasing tension, and season 4 is full steam ahead as most of the plot lines are resolved (since season 5 was a last minute reprieve).
Of course, if you are looking at this page, odds are you are already a fan and looking for information on the sets.  The picture, presented in widescreen, is hit and miss, with some dust popping up occasionally.  It is clear and sharp most of the time, however.  Sound is presented in full surround and has never sounded better.  Each set contains two audio commentaries by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and a season intro by cast and crew.  They also have some behind the scenes documentaries and encyclopedia entries introducing you to the world of Babylon 5.  All the sets but season 1 have one audio commentary each by various cast members.  And season 4 has a great blooper reel.
Whether you buy the seasons bundled like this or individually, don't miss your chance to own this fantastic TV series.",1074038400,10,2113,4.489528795811518
8006982,3,B00015Y0EG,"I'm a fan of 'Babylon 5', but buying a set that contains the first 4 seasons, and
not the final 5th season seems odd indeed.

Unless at a given moment the price for this plus buying the 5th season separately is a better deal,
I'd urge you to buy the whole set, 5th season included.  Would you buy a terrific novel with
the last 50 pages missing?",1313193600,,345,4.134328358208955
8006983,5,B00015Y0EG,"An excellent and ongoing good vs. Evil Series that ""smacks the pretty"" off Star Trek and others.  This series is collectable and really a great gift with many hours of excellent viewing enjoyment",1249430400,,195,4.909090909090909
8006984,5,B00015Y0EG,"An excellent series, Babylon 5, brings to the screen the ongoing adventures and parallel stories of prominent people aboard a major station under Human control in neutral space.

The setting is the Babylon 5 space station orbiting Epsilon 3.  The year is 2258, ten years after the Earth-Minbari War, and representatives from the five major space-faring races, the Centauri, Humans, Minbari, Narns, and the Vorlons, as well as numerous minor races have all gathered at B5 in a last effort at maintaining galactic peace.  The complications, however, have only just begun...

Michael O'Hare, Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Jerry Doyle, Andrea Thompson (who is HOT!!!), Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

In a nutshell, the show's strong points have to be:

1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots that keep getting better and better!

2) The GREAT character development, and

3) The wonderful feeling of being ADDICTED to the show and wanting more!

In short, Babylon 5 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!",1180742400,,1440,5.194805194805195
8006985,5,B00015Y0EG,"Babylon 5 was one of the best television series ever in the medium. Taken for all in all, it was the best SF/F show ever on television. This was because it didn't dodge the big questions:

Who are we?

What do we want?

Where are we going?

It made those big questions the central focus of the series. It was good because it didn't always provide clear and succinct answers to them. Also, it made things very much like they are in the real world. Impure or evil motives might lead to actions with overall good outcomes, and good intentions may well pave the road to hell.

J. Michael Straczynski is the reason is stayed focus on the large themes. JMS created the series and wrote all the episodes of the third session, as well as all the 4th session. He specifically looked to create myths that addressed the big questions in life.

You can't address the big issues without acknowledging the reasons that most people stop thinking about them: the minutia of life often makes us focus on little things that often don't bear on the larger issues. JMS wrote the series in a way that the big questions came into line with the little issues of life.

This focus allowed for characters to grow and change over the course of the series. For example, Vir, a character that starts off as a basic comic-relief player, yet ends up as one of those who can speak with great wisdom. The third session was when this change in him became evident. Also, the characters are not all perfect examples of morality and heroism: they each have their strengths and faults. This makes things much more believable. Especially since much of the underlying stories of good vs. evil is rather fanciful. In order to make it all believable is requires that there be underlying things that make sense, so that the home viewer can grab a handle on the program in order to anchor the rest of the story.

The normal human issues of alcoholism, drug addition, religion, family problems, bad marriages, etc. are all explored in the course of the show. This very much adds to the believability aspects of the program.

Many other shows with similar takes on the world of character development have been ""St. Elsewhere"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"".  Even, dare I add it, various aspects of Star Trek, especially Deep Space Nine?  (I won't go into the B5 vs. DS9 arguments.)

The acting in the show is normally good, with especially good performances by Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar and Peter Jurasik as Londo Mollari.

The first season of the show is very rough, with about half the shows going from bad to poor.  That said, in second season things got much better. The third session of Babylon 5 is probably the best of the five sessions the program was on the air. With the fourth session very close in quality to the third. The fifth was weird... very well made, and at times very well written, but in the end the 5th season was about the same in quality as the second.  That would have been fine if it had come before season three and four.

One of the minor overall problems with the show is that, although clean and succinct answers are not always provided, they are sometimes forced in when they shouldn't have been. I am sure that this was not the intention all of the time, as the shows creative force was JMS.  It is just that it is expected in TV land that they be provided. Basically, I am sure they were sometimes added because TV executives probably insisted on them. Especially when the message sometimes is that ""there is no clear message"".  This can, at times makes the show feel a little clunky and schizophrenic.

I know that my criticism of this may sound almost as if I am contradicting myself. And that may be a minor problem with it in the show... maybe the show is contradicting itself in some ways.  But then, that's life.",1139011200,,3827,4.526850507982584
8006986,5,B00015Y0EG,"My partner told me about Babylon 5 a long time ago, when we first started dating, four years ago. He told me about B5 and I knew of it but when it first came out I was much younger than I am now. I couldn't find it on local tv or was to be in bed for church in the morning. Later I discovered it was on at midnight on Saturday turning to Sunday, so I never got to see it. Now that I am 29 and watched it when I was 28, I am so glad that I got to see it from beginning to end. We own them all. We bought them right after the other, cause we watch all our DVD's in order A to Z. I just had to see the next one. We watched them all in 3 months. $85 a set is much, but it was worth it. I lost interest in sci-fi when star trek came out with all these stupid things but this one just made me want to watch them more and more. Episode after episode and once we finished a DVD I bought the next or he did, I love this and recommend them to anyone and everyone. This isn't a HELP ME IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES EPISODE, it lasts till the next one is over and then there is another story for the next one. It was well written and the nay-sayers who don't like it, just never stay there for the whole thing, cause they like the HELP ME IN THE LAST 15 MIN EPISODE that all the other sci-fi's give them. This is and will always be the best sci-fi that I have ever seen. I won't tell you what happens. I just want you to experience it all for yourself. Well written, well acted, well detailed in other species, although, you'll have your favorties and you won't. BUT over all, it is the best that I have seen in a long time and it shall remain dear to me and when someone mentions sci-fi this is the ONE that shall always remain in my head. Star Trek could have come up with stuff like this, but it never did and lost me in DEEP SPACE NINE TO THE BABYLON 5.",1128470400,,1839,3.779220779220779
8006987,1,B00015Y0EG,"As far as I can tell, this is merely the first 4 seasons all together.  Go and price buying the seasons separately; you'll find it cheaper EVEN ON THIS SITE.  I can't detect any special features in this package that don't exist in the separate season DVDs that I bought as they came out.
Babylon 5 is very probably the best series ever.  It is the only series (so far) that was fully planned out, all 5 seasons, before it was filmed.  It is somewhat of a miracle that it managed to get made... so help convince nay-sayers that they're missing out!  Buy the DVDs... just not THIS one.",1082160000,10,583,4.3119266055045875
8006988,5,B00015Y0EG,"Yes, Babylon 5 is the best sci-fi show ever produced. No doubt in my mind. It simply is.

Season 1 starts slowly. Mainly because the show was not written by J. Michael Straczynski (series creator) but by outside help. Result: Lousy B-movie scripts. Only 5-6 episodes are truly good.

But then Seasons 2-5 arrive, and the series truly shines. This is the CORE of the Babylon 5 story. J.Michael Straczynski took the reins and wrote ~95% of the show. AND IT SHOWS. Seasons 2-5 start with battles, end with battles, and have plenty of drama in the middle. A new race called ""The Shadows"" starts pulling strings, manipulating the characters, and ultimately spinning off a war. And just when you think all is dark and dreary and depressing... all hell turns loose! The drama just builds and builds and builds.

And then we have... THE GRAND FINALE TO THE NOVEL FOR TV: Set 20 years in the future, this single episode will bring tears to your eyes, because it shows the death of the hero: President Sheridan. As series creator J.Michael Straczynski wrote:

""The sad truth is that we die. That is not a happy ending, not a sad ending, simply a fact. The question is what we accomplish during the days and months and years preceding; do we leave the world a better place or a worse place? If we have left the world around us a better place, as these characters did, then it's a happy ending. - - - - - Ultimately, for me, the end of B5 is neither a sad ending nor a happy ending; I'd say it was a graceful ending, a dignified ending, an ending that said individuals can effect profound change, if they are willing to put their own lives and happiness on the line; not happy, not sad, but a testament to the idea that you have used your time here well.""

""What interests me, what I wanted to do with making this show, was in large measure to examine the issues and emotions and events that precede a war... the effects of the war itself... and the aftermath of the war. The war is hardware; the people are at the center of the story."" Well said Mr. Straczynski, and thank you for creating this wonderful show. Like a classic novel, Babylon 5 reaches beyond mere entertainment. Thank you.",1079222400,,2177,4.459798994974874

Never before have I been enthralled by such a long lasting and complex story arc.  This series came at a time when fans of sci-fi desperately needed a new show.  It filled the bill and then some.  More gritty than Star Trek with an amazingly diverse cast of characters, this hi-tech drama sucked in into it's web and kept you wanting more.  The CG effects were groundbreaking for the time and still hold up well these years later.
