Mark's work, a beautiful collection of scores that were realized each week by different musicians at the Cantor Art Center, is ideally suited to DVD presentation. Two videos present a scrolling version of the score panels, and there's a 20-minute documentary of the work featuring insightful interviews. The centerpiece is a video presenting photos and one-minute audio samples from each performance.

I've heard Mark describe his music as ""uncompromising and unmarketable"", and there will be some who agree. Those who like a work that explores some of the foundational ideas of music as an art will enjoy this.",1295913600,,728,5.161016949152542
