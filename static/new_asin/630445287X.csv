881750,5,630445287X,"I've been watching movies a long, long time. I've seen many westerns in my time and like most of them. So imagine to my surprise when I found out that until I saw this film I had never seen an Audie Murphy film. Imagine my shock when I watched in amazement as this story unravel. A western, but a different kind of western. A psychological western. Audie is the bad guy. A man come to town to kill someone. Question is who. The town goes bonkers trying to find out his little secret. Paranoia runs rampant throughtout. Everyone is basically played off against each other until the secret is out who Audue is there to take out. Watching the townspeople go nuts was fantastic. Just a tad let down at the end, but seems typical for the late 50's film that it is. I'm not going to give it away. You see for yourself. Now that I've seen this film I want to see other films of Audie Murphy. Enjoy this one. You will not be disappointed if it is a good western you are looking for.",1141516800,7,974,4.213903743315508
881751,5,630445287X,"There are people who love to do ""lists"" on AOL with regard to movies and such, and you can usually tell something about their age and their overall exposure to artistic genres by what they list in terms of their notions of ""the best"". Most such lists don't don't usually reflect much other than abysmal ignorance of the subjects they address.

  Any list of supposed ""best westerns"" that doesn't include Audie Murphy's awesome ""No Name On the Bullet"" is about as hare brained as one that doesn't include ""The Ox Bow Incident"" , ""The Virginian"", ""The Gunfighter"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""Red River"", ""Dodge City"", ""The Searchers"", ""Shane"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Winchester 73"", or John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy on it.

  Fact is , the most decorated soldier...not just of World War Two...but in the entire history of the U.S. Armed Forces...could not only call artillery down on himself while he machine-gunned down an entire enemy rifle company with a .50 calbre machine gun mounted on the back of a disabled, burning tank destroyer (earning a Congressional Medal of Honor in the process)...he could also ACT. AND, if given good material and capable direction, he could do some FINE acting.

  ""No Name On the Bullet"" is vivid, engrossing proof of that contention. This is a western that is anything BUT ""run of the mill"". Put it up against ""High Noon"" and it has twice the tension and edginess, and Audie Murphy's ""John Gant"" would have Gary Cooper's ""Marshal Will Kane"" leaving town so fast he'd leave a windstorm in his wake.

  Murphy's Gant is a hired killer who rides into Lordsburg one day and sets the entire town on edge. Gant's reputation is considerable. He is said to be lightning fast with a six gun and deadly accurate. He is also known to have put many men into the ground, a lot of whom were considered good gun-hands themselves.
Gant's methodolgy is to goad his target into a shootout. In this manner the killing is waived as a ""self-defense"" claim...quite common and effective in the 19th century West.

  In Gant's case, nobody knows who he intends to kill until the event actually goes down. And here in Lordsburg everyone from bankers to miners to saloon-keepers to store-owners worries that it might be THEM...(""Everybody has enemies"")

  From the hour Gant hits town, stress and paranoia begin to take over. People all over town are convinced that THEY are the targets and some neighbor of theirs might be the one who hired this killer to ""do"" them. People turn against each other and the entire town becomes a powderkeg of volatility.

  And Gant enjoys every minute of it. He enjoys psychologically terrorizing these people. Playing them. He enjoys the effect his name has on them, how they ""kowtow"" to him and cringe when he walks by. Oh, he plays nicey-nice and ambivalent at all times. He is polite, well-spoken, obviously sophisticated, educated, and well-read (a friend commented to me once that, if t.v.'s ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" Paladin character were written to be a clean shaven, babyfaced psychopath, then this would be him).
Yet there is a smug little smirk he carries around with him, and a glinting look that comes into his eyes at times that say..""watch yourself around this boyo...he's not playing with a full deck of cards"". Or does he just lack true depth of feeling or conscience?

  One intriguing scene has a mob of townsmen accost Gant at the porch of the city hotel. They are going to try to frighten him off...tell him to get out of town before they all cut loose on him. He looks at them withn utter contempt and urges them to have at it. He tells them which ones he's going to kill right off and then tells the rest they can take their own chances before he drops.  The mob scatters quickly. They want none of what he is selling. The scene works because of the steely-eyed believability of Murphy's performance...AND because of the psychological awareness by the audience that this IS Audie Murphy on this porch...someone who in real life could street-slap ""Scarface"".

  Gant is a very complex character as played by Murphy. He is both likable and scary at the same time. And Murphy the actor works the nuances that swing him back and forth BETWEEN the likable and the scary in brilliant fashion. This is GOOD acting
here. Murphy delivers a cowboy ""boogeyman"" on par with Robert Mitchum's evil preacher in ""Night of the Hunter"", and, on the strength of this performance in ""No Name"", one would have to consider that Audie Murphy could have turned in a hair-raising Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" if Anthony Perkins had not gotten the role.

  Everyone else in this film does a great job. Filled with familiar character-actor faces throughout, the story moves along with nary a drag and just pulls you into its multi-faceded story line and holds you there right to the end.

  ""No Name On the Bullet"". Remember that title. If you're a fan of westerns,or good movies in general, you need to be aware of it and sit yourself down to watch it sometime. It's a ""Good'un"".",1119744000,16,5029,4.73593570608496
881752,5,630445287X,"Audie Murphy excels in this low-key suspenseful western. His portrayal of [...] John Gant is one of his finest roles: stoic, pragmatic and cooly emotionless, yet not without humor and even a soft side. Those who like Audie Murphy westerns will enjoy this movie.

The rest of the cast is great, and the suspense created by the characters not knowing which town citizen will be Murphy's victim is truly nail-biting. The over reactions and false conclusions of those who feel they will be the victim lead inevitably to tragic consequences.

At a compact hour and seventeen minute run time, this movie is a lot of fun and doesn't waste any time getting right to the action. A forgotten western gem that has finally debuted on DVD.",1105488000,9,726,4.753968253968254
881753,4,630445287X,"As others reviewers have noted, 1959's ""No Name on the Bullet"" is far from being a typical Audie Murphy western. Under Jack Arnold's expert direction, the focus here is on suspense and tension, rather than action. When gunman John Gant rides into town, most of the local citizens are justifiably nervous. Gant is a hired killer, and he seldom visits a town just to see the sights. Much of the film revolves around the questions--why is he here ? Who is he after ? Which of the town's citizens will die ? Since Gant isn't the talkative type, the suspense keeps building, not to mention the nervous paranoia of the townfolk.
As Gant, Murphy delivers a chilling performance. You never doubt that, behind that baby face and modest build, is a man not to be crossed ( by all accounts, in real life, as well as in movies ). He is not intimidated by anyone, not even a hostile crowd who thinks that, by sheer numbers, it can scare him away. As the town's doctor who tries to befriend Gant, Charles Drake delivers a strong performance as he comes to realize that he cannot distract the killer from his purpose.
Other fine supporting actors further add to the quality of the film--Whit Bissell, Karl Swenson, Warren Stevens and Virginia Grey. Apart from one climactic scene with Mr. Murphy, leading lady, Joan Evans ( not to be confused with the popular comedienne ), has little to do but make coffee for her ""man"", Charles Drake.
I found the ending to be memorable, and--for those of you who like action--there is gunplay at certain crucial parts of the movie.
The DVD has beautiful colour, is widescreen and mono sound. The only extra is the original trailer.
Audie Murphy made a lot of westerns in the 1950s and 60s. ""No Name on the Bullet"" is not the most action-packed, but it is certainly one of the most interesting, and features one of his best perfomances. If he is not yet represented in your western DVD collection, this is an excellent title to start with.",1087776000,75,1959,4.584045584045584
881754,5,630445287X,"Audie Murphy is actually one of the most believable western movie stars. His ability in armed combat prove this and this particular western movie is one of the best. I have watched and own many western movies, and this is one of my favorites.
Murphy plays a clean cut and possible hero in every western he plays in, but this role is one of his most unusual. I recommend it to any western film collector.",1086652800,10,403,4.386666666666667
881755,5,630445287X,"Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of World War II. After the war he got involved with movies -- predominantly westerns. Frankly, his films are highly variable in quality. Some are pretty bad B movies. But given a good script, good direction, and good supporting actors, Murphy turned in several surprisingly fine performances. No Name on the Bullet is a case in point. Murphy convincingly plays John Gant -- a cool, deceptively-likeable hired killer with a reputation for goading his intended victim into attempting to draw first so that Gant can always get off by claiming self defence. This movie is a study of the effect of Gant's arrival in a town on it's citizens. While Gant quietly drinks coffee in the hotel bar or plays chess with the local doctor, the town's leading citizens go to pieces because their secret guilts convince each of them that he is Gant's target. The finale of this tense psychological drama is surprising but not contrived. This is a very good western by any standard and probably Audie Murphy's best. I hope its availability on DVD will find it the wide audience which it richly deserves.",1086220800,43,1128,4.819587628865979
881756,5,630445287X,"Audie Murphy gives one of his best performances as John Gant, the hired assassin, whose arrival in town pricks a lot of guilty consciences. No one is absolutely certain who he came to kill, but that doesn't stop a few restless townspeople from getting nervous and cracking under the pressure as Gant plays it cool and bides his time. He seems unsurprised by the effect his presence has in town. As Gant eloquently puts it, he doesn't have to deliver a bullet to those types of men because ""they are already dead,"" suffocated by the weight of guilt caused by past sins. Gants kills only who he is paid to kill, and only time will tell who he has really come for.
But there's more to this cold-blooded avenger than meets the eye. Or so thinks Luke, the town's likeable physician, who is a paragon of civic and moral virtue. Juxtapposed against each other, the two seem to be exact opposites, but a sort of friendship develops as Luke tries desperately to get into Gant's head and somehow turn him around before he does what he came to do. No Name on the Bullet explores many interesting issues such as vengeance, justice, law and the burden of sin. Audie Murphy reveals his darker side as he plays the self-named ""avenging angel."" He even tries to compares himself to his new friend Luke because in his mind, he too is concerned with eliminating ""public health problems,"" namely those who are guilty but unpunished.
Just like Murphy himself, there's more to this film than meets the eye. And the plot takes a surprising turn at the end, too, so it's altogether unpredictable. As evidenced by another great performance in To Hell and Back, Audie Murphy was certainly a great soldier on screen and off. Although he was the most decorated soldier of World War II, like many other greats of his day (John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart) Murphy probably felt he was just doing his duty. There are those who think this may be just another Audie Murphy western, but this is not true at all. It's a stellar film that stands alone in its brilliant performances and handling of the fallen human condition.",1050537600,43,2083,4.617250673854447
881757,5,630445287X,"Everyone always talks about Audie Murphy's baby face and his slight build. But take a close look at his eyes. He was a cold-eyed individual, brought about largely by his 2 years in combat and subsequently suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. If he had been born during the Old West times, he would have been a killer. ""No Name on the Bullet"" personifies Murphy's personality had he lived during those times.
Murphy gives a splendid performance as John Gant, a hired killer whose presence in Lordsburg causes total chaos, even though he does nothing at first - just sitting around drinking coffee and playing chess with the local physician.
Murphy's facial expressions were great as he smugly looked around and watched the carnage his name and reputation created. The banker winds up killing himself (even though he wasn't Murphy's target), and another man in town tries to get drunk enough to have the courage to face Gant, who stares him down and sends him fleeing from the bar.
This was probably Murphy's finest performance outside of ""To Hell and Back,"" when he was not really acting but working on raw emotion, adrenaline and painful memories of the war.
Even when the town bands together and comes to make him leave, Gant remains cold as ice and backs them down. He knew they could kill him, but the question was ""How many could Gant kill before they killed him?"" None of them were willing to die to get rid of Gant.
Charles Drake also delivered a great performance as the physician opposite Murphy's character. While the entire town was in panic and chaos, wondering who Gant had come for, Drake calmly plays a game of chess with the gunman, trying to get inside his head and figure out what ""makes him tick.""
A suspenseful thriller with a minimum amount of violence, ""No Name on the Bullet"" comes highly recommended.",1012176000,21,1833,4.7492163009404385

881759,4,630445287X,"Audie Murphy portrays a young outlaw who kills for money in this psychological thriller, a genre of Westerns, that deals with the impact of people's pasts in a small western town. Chaos breaks out when the threat of  consequence for past immoralities causes townspeople to face their guilt.  Subtle, simple, Murphy depicts a cool, level-headed killer amused by the  effects his presence in town is having, yet occupied only with killing the  man he was sent to murder.  In this town, there is no name on the bullet,  and everyone thinks its headed for them.  Great flick.",940550400,9,571,4.824742268041237

So many other reviewers have done a terrific job of talking about the movie, so I won't repeat that here.  But this is a move that is well worth watching.

882234,4,630445287X,"The film. I don't know Audie Murphy films outside of ""Night Passage"" which co-stars James Stewart. I had read in Robert Nott's excellent ""Last of the Western Heroes"" that ""No Name on the Bullet"" is, perhaps, Murphy's best western. And it *is* quite good -- a suspenseful, tense drama with some psychological overtones and worth seeing. It's a very good, if rather somber, western.

Image quality: Good, steady, mostly clear. Colors look subdued, perhaps faded. I'm guessing the source for this scan was a 35mm film print that has not received much attention. The original camera negative needs to be scanned and the entire film be color timed. As it is, the DVD exhibits some occasional scratches and debris. It looks a bit dark -- even the daylight scenes though some are lighter than others. I love the main title sequence -- fabulous scenery.

Sound quality: Clear mono sound. Dialog is never lost in the mix.

Languages: English. English captions. Spanish and French subtitles.

Extras: A bare bones release -- contains one horizontally stretched out trailer and that's it.

Packaging: The original movie poster graphic is substantially better than what passes for a cover here but is serviceable. No liner notes.

Summary: A very good, though dark-themed, western. Worth the view.",1442620800,,1285,5.0663507109004735

882887,5,630445287X,"Sometimes a man just can't come in and grab a cup of coffee and go unnoticed. Not when your reputation's as big as big britches. In NO NAME ON THE BULLET, soft-spoken, baby-faced Audie Murphy delivers an understated performance, except that there's a palpable aura of menace hanging about him. Next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Hell-and-Back/dp/B0001FVDH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Hell and Back</a>, this is his best film.

When infamous killer-for-hire John Gant (Murphy) and his towering reputation ride into the western town of Lordsburg, it ignites a wave of fear and paranoia. As Gant cooly insinuates his presence into the sleepy community, more than a few citizens pause to examine their past deeds, each fearful that Gant's bullet is meant for him. Murphy plays Gant with laconic ease, low-keyed and impassive, although there's always that worrying glitter in his eyes. John Gant bides his time and plays chess against the town sawbones and occasionally waxes philosophical, content to observe the townspeople's rising anxieties. One gets the sense that he's amused by the reaction he engenders. He's pretty forthcoming about the contempt he feels for them.

NO NAME ON THE BULLET is an interesting departure from the typical oater. It opts for unrelenting psychological drama in lieu of the frequent shoot-'em-up, and it offers an atypical ending. It's a thoughtful and fascinating character study. For most of the film, Gant is a passive entity. But his presence alone serves as a catalyst to upheaval within the community. Lots of guilty consciences fester in Lordsburg, and several of these panicked parties decide to take matters into their own hands. One in particular grows so alarmed that he chooses to kill himself. Gant is notorious for his modus operandi of goading his victim into drawing first so that Gant can later claim self-defense. The town sheriff finds his hands tied as this professional assassin has as yet to break the law.

The only man in town that Gant seems to respect is Luke Canfield (Charles Drake), the righteous town physician who can throw a mean hammer. Gant and Canfield like each other - and Gant refers to Canfield as ""the only other honest man in town"" - but, given their opposing vocations, it's inevitable that they butt heads. A real-life highly decorated World War II hero, Audie Murphy is always best when playing characters close to his own personality and type. Gant is a stone-cold killer and this sparks enough commonality within Murphy that he effortlessly brings him to life. To see Murphy in this role is to get cheesed that he was cast in so many second string movies, because NO NAME ON THE BULLET hints at how good he could've been, never mind that he's routinely expressed his disinterest in acting. But just watch him as he, while seated with palms on the saloon table, quietly faces down a drunk about to make a play. Or later when he, all by his lonesome, intimidates a posse of armed men. He informs them: ""I use my gun for money and I don't like to work for nothing. But you trouble me again and I might have to break my rule."" The mob sheepishly disperses. Audie Murphy has always had that quiet authority. He convinces me that he really can back down desperate people by dint of mere presence and a few words. Abetted by a menacing reputation, of course.

Note that the DVD presents the film in Anomorphic Widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1) and includes the original theatrical trailer.",1322956800,3,3510,5.025773195876289

The film does tackle themes of revenge, law and justice. Murphy is a hired killer and everybody in the small town he enters knows he's a killer. And more than one person is afraid Murphy might be after him. There's little gunplay but the suspense in the film comes from the townspeople who are afraid some dark secrets might not only be exposed but will get them killed.
  Some of the finest scenes are between Murphy and the town's doctor, played by Charles Drake, as they are playing chess. The only minor flaw is some elements in the conclusion.

Directed by Jack Arnold

John Gant (Audie Murphy) rides into the town of Lordsburg and quietly checks into the hotel. He doesn't say much, nor does he need to - his mere presence does the talking. Gant is a killer, a hired assassin, a gunman with 23 dead men to his credit, but he is not a murderer or a criminal; all of his killings have been legal, a result of self-defense when the men he was after drew on him. When he comes to a town, someone dies as surely as if he were the angel of death - he even tells the town doctor in Lordsburg (Charles Drake) that he's in ""a similar line of work,"" and ends up playing chess with him.

Who has he come to ""see"" in Lordsburg? No one is sure, but as Sheriff Buck Hastings tells his deputy, it will be mighty interesting watching the leading citizens over the next few days. Sure enough, the town banker locks himself in his office with a gun, his business partner starts wearing a gun for the first time in his life, the man they cheated in their dealings is also armed; and one guilty cuckold (Warren Stevens) is positive his ex-rival has paid Gant. Less than 12 hours after that, there's no law left in Lordsburg, every dirty little secret in every man's past starts bubbling to the surface, and gun play has broken out in the streets between the men who think their respective rivals have brought Gant to town.

Yes! - that's legendary sci-fi director Jack Arnold at the helm in this always interesting western and the gift of a suspenseful ending.

882992,5,630445287X,"A cold, paid killer comes to town, and the town falls apart in
paranoia, wondering who his target is. An interesting political comment
on fear and mob mentality (especially the cold war kind), and a
surprisingly complex look at morality for a film from it's era.

There's also an unusual bond between hero and bad guy that feels ahead
of its time.

You can bet a different ending would be demanded today.

Audie Murphy as the killer isn't a great actor, but his baby-faced
ordinariness makes the character much more fascinating than an obvious
bit of ""tough guy"" casting like a Jack Palance would have.

Along with ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", this shows Jack Arnold as
one of the more interesting, thoughtful US filmmakers of the late
1950s.",1303344000,,745,4.796875

882995,4,630445287X,"This film is suspenseful and contains a psychological study, but the latter is lite. A gunman for hire rides into town. He is known to have killed over twenty men. His practice is to arrive, secure a hotel room, and view the town before he kills his victim. He was never arrested because he always goads his victims into drawing a gun first and then killing them in self defense. Many city inhabitants see the gunman take the hotel room and become agitated - and here is the psychology - because they had done wrong in the past or they have rivals at present, and they think that the gunman has come to kill them. Their reactions are interesting to view. Also interesting is the town doctor who tries to stop the people from killing one another because they fear that a rival hired the gunman, and trying to stop others from trying to kill the gunman before he kills them. The suspense arises from the questions: who did the gunman come to kill and did he stop in town only because his horse was limping?",1295049600,,1004,4.403225806451613

For those of you who think Clint Eastwood when you think Western or Cool or somebody you wouldn't want to end up looking down the barrel of their gun, I suggest you do a little research on Audie Murphy. This man was only 5'.5"", but I wouldn't bet a nickle on Eastwood's survival if they had a real life gun fight. What kind of man would single-handedly hold off hundreds of Germans while telling the rest of his unit to go back and take cover? Well, that was real life, and only one indecent of many. In this movie, you see a gunfighter with a dangerous reputation ride into town and shake everyone up by his mere presence. As you watch his acting, keep in mind that in real life, his father had deserted the family when he was ten, his mother had died young and the only food that kept his brothers and sisters alive was what he killed with his gun. The high point of any gunfight is the look in their eyes. Compare the understated menace in his eyes to Eastwood while you keep in mind that this man really killed somewhere around 300 men in real life, while they were shooting at him. Audie Murphy is one of our most decorated war heroes and in the real sense of the word. Go ahead, do a Wikipedia search on this man, then buy this movie and watch it. The next time you are having a bad day do it all again. Just maybe, the things you have to contend with aren't quite as bad as you thought. One more thing after you do this; whenever you watch any movie again with a hero in it that you think is brave or cool- The word Murphy will appear in your mind -Trust me!",1260057600,,1587,4.122580645161291

anyone might expect from any motion picture . This a very adult and literate western .It is more a measure of philosophy and morality than gunplay . It certainly does have its share of action as Gant's presence lights up the screen and the town . I will not tell you the story , but no one who sees this film will be cheated . And the character played by Audie Murphy is one you shall never forget .",1258502400,,964,3.923469387755102
883000,4,630445287X,"This is a pretty good little Western that I'd love to see remade. The title and premise are fantastic. Very simple, but ripe with promise. A known assassin-for-hire, John Gant (played by real life war hero Audie Murphy), arrives in town and checks into the hotel. Everyone has heard of him, but no one knows who he's there to kill. His method is also known: he provokes his target into a fight and then kills him in ""self-defense,"" so he gets away with it legally. Gant plays it cool for several days, allowing the more tightly-wound members of the town to self-destruct under their own hidden guilt. He befriends the town doctor named Luke (Gant reflects on the Biblical reference to the apostle/physician) before Luke learns who he is.

The build-up is handled pretty well. The seedier residents immediately begin to panic and conspire against each other and Gant. None of them are particularly memorable characters, but they ratchet up the tension and provide a few great scenes when they each face Gant. The most memorable is when a tall, skinny, wife-stealing gambler gets drunk and confronts the seated assassin. Gant calmly prods him, even placing his palms flat on the table. ""All right. If you think you can do it, go ahead and try. My hands are on the table. I couldn't possibly outdraw you. So go ahead and shoot.""

Another stand-out scene features Gant facing down a large posse determined to kill him or drive him out of town. ""There are many of you. Yes, you could kill me. If you're willing enough. But it's only fair to tell you that I'll kill you, Stricker. And you, Dutch Henry. The physician. His father. And there might even be time for you, storekeeper."" The scene has been played out many times since then, most memorably for me in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/B00005RHGL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>, and while I don't know if No Name on the Bullet was the first to use this scene, it's certainly one of the most potent uses. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warlock/dp/B0007PALQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warlock</a>&nbsp;had a similar scene, and is also from 1959, by chance.)

Save for Murphy (and maybe Edgar Stehli as Judge Benson), the performances are mostly adequate. They do the job, they're certainly not bad, but they're nothing special, either. I'd like to see some stronger character actors filling the supporting roles in a remake, and a more interesting actor playing Luke. (The most interesting parts with Luke are always Gant's reaction to him rather than Luke himself.) Murphy as Gant captivated me, however. I don't think all of that was because of his talent, however. While he certainly plays his role well, with a Death-like calm and serenity, I had recently devoured his Wikipedia entry and was in awe knowing that this baby-faced actor was one of the most decorated soldiers in history. It was hard to divorce the man from the part while watching him.

The dichotomy between the killer and the healer is perhaps a little too obvious, but it works here. Some of the dialogue from Luke is a bit on-the-nose, and I longed for a more interestingly written character, but Gant's dialogue is pretty good. He has some really good lines and only a few clunkers. (Anytime he makes medical jokes to Luke, like ""that's your prescription doc... fill it,"" I groaned.)

With a length of just 77 minutes, this is a decent Western with a few exceptional elements that are worth your time.",1255478400,,3530,5.089810017271157
883096,5,630445287X,This is not your typical Audie Murphy western and he does some of his best work in a less than heroic role.  If you just like good old western or if you are a Murphy fan you need to add this to your collection,1252713600,,209,3.75

883098,4,630445287X,"This is a very fine western movie with a good supporting cast. Audie Murphy portrays a gunfighter who is a hired killer that provokes his intended victims into making the first play so he can get away with murder by self-defense. After coming into town with such a reputation, several of the townspeople are terrified that Murphy has been hired by an enemy of theirs to kill them and that is where most of the plot of the movie takes place. It takes a half to two-thirds of the way into the movie to figure out who Murphy's intended victim is and then you are not completely sure until the last few minutes. This movie is well worth watching. The only reason I did not give it five stars is I would like to have seen a little more gunplay. I think Audie only fires his gun one time the whole movie.",1233964800,,798,4.256578947368421

883100,5,630445287X,"I agree with all those positive reviews given to this film. The story is a very good one and Audie Murphy is just right in the part. It is amazing what sometimes can come out with quite little of money. This is not a shoestring film, but there is no waste of money. I watched just Murphy's Gunsmoke, which is not a great film, but he is good in it, too. He is not just natural, but can act. If you like westerns, see this film.",1220227200,,427,3.9767441860465116
883101,5,630445287X,"Not your usual western.  Murphy is a paid gunslinger,'bad guy'. Come to rid the town of one of it's good people. As in the title no one knows ""who?"". Seems like just about everyone thinks he is the target. This causes a lot of inter-action with all the good people.  Audie Murphy just seat-back and watches everyone. Suprising ending, must see if you are an Audie Murphy fan, as I am, or just like a good Western Movie.",1219708800,,419,4.358974358974359
883102,5,630445287X,"Ended up the bullet did have a name, but I've already forgotten what it was, and I just saw the movie yesterday.  I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen.  I'll never forget Audie.
 When I was a teenager back in the 40's and 50's.  I had a huge crush on him from seeing To Hell and Back 6 or 8 times.  I'm sure I must have seen some others of his movies since my boyfriend at the time, my husband of 52 years now, loved and still loves Westerns, old and new, as we all did in those days seeing as how we had more westerns than any other genre'.  We had 5 drive-in theatres in our small town and 4 up-town theatres, and so it could be that I saw lots more of his movies. I'm getting them from Amazon and watching them now with my still ""boyfriend"". I think, however it could just be my old tired brain that doesn't let me remember.  Anyhow, watching To Hell and Back over and over, was enough at the time for me.  They don't get any better than Audie playing himself. I believe he mostly always played himself no matter what the movie.  Just cool, calm and collected.  I'm seeing them now.  He is still irresistible to me.  I don't think I saw this one.  I believe I would have remembered that very clever ending.  I thought at one point in the movie, ""that's gotta be a clue, but it wasn't the clue that I thought it would be"". (I hope I didn't give it away.)  I'm glad I never read the book, if there was one  It would have spoiled the movie for me.  Audie was just awesome in this movie.  Just as all you other reviewers said.  He was a ""cool hand AUDIE"".  (Remindful slightly of Gary Cooper, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, but he WAS AUDIE)I have missed him so much over the years after his unfortunate and untimely death. It's odd how that when you see someone over and over in a movie or on TV or just listening to the same music over and over the way I'm won't to do (Don Gibson) you form a kind of friendship or some kind of weird feeling that you're related.
 His small stature was outshone by his presence, seemingly nonchalantness, and his fearlessness.  I still say there should be an Audie Murphy Day every year on his birthday, or maybe the birthday of the day he climbed up on that burning tank and mowed down probably dozens of the enemy and saved how many of his men, or even on VE Day, since he played a huge part in that, but it's way overdue, and so I guess we'll never see one. Think about it:  We don't have any commemorative day for our country's most decorated war hero, but we have days for other peoples who never served our country.  As far as I know he never even got a stamp.  Elvis did.!! Oh I'm sorry, Elvis did serve.  Maybe if he'd given his life ""over there""??!!.  But it's all the more astounding that he didn't have to give his life. He was ""bigger"" than all of those Germans put together.  And he had a heart evidenced in his To Hell and Back book and movie. He loved his Mama and his siblings very much and took very good care of them.  When I met my love of my life, and then met his mama, and observed them together, I was talking about it with my mama one day and she said to me ""A man who loves his Mother and is good to her, is a wonderful man and will make a very good husband for some lucky girl.""  I believe it!!
This was an outstanding movie, and Audie made it so for me.  If the director could take the credit for Audie's acting in this movie, then he truly deserved the credit.  But to me, it was just the way Audie has always been.  Even when he was ""Over There"" killing the bad guys.
I wanted to go out to Hollywood and get him and bring him home with me, but my mama wouldn't let me.
He was always MISTER COOL.
However, in his biography, the author said he had his demons haunting him after his return from the war.  Well, that is totally understandable, but he surely didn't wear them on his sleeve.  WHAT A BIG MAN!",1214006400,,3874,4.092838196286472
883103,4,630445287X,"The more sinister the character, the better Audie Murphy's performance. Here, his character is more overtly evil (with Charles Drake taking on the boring goodnik role) as a known killer-for-hire who has just arrived in town setting off a paranoidal furor. And how Audie embodies cool! Dressed in black. Shaping his laidback Texas twang into something ominous. Confident. And dangerous.

He was generally dismissed as a non-actor. And Audie believed it too. So I don't know what it was he was doing in this movie, but I wish he did it more often. And I wish other actors could learn to do it, too.

This is a thoughtful Western with just enuf action to qualify as such and to keep the groundlings happy. Topping it off, there is the memorable ending. With a better director and better production values this might have been a great Western instead of just a very good one.",1186876800,,871,4.686274509803922
883104,5,630445287X,"People who think Audie Murphy didn't have any acting talent need to watch this movie.  It is so not your typical B-Western.  Murphy shines as a cold, calculated hired killer -- cast very much against type.  The supporting cast lends credibility to this psychological thriller, particularly Charles Drake as the town's doctor.

The plot is simple and well written.  This is not about a gunfighter, such as the classic ""The Gunfighter"" with Gregory Peck.  Gant is an infamous hired killer riding into a town and watching as people with well-hidden secrets begin to crumble.  Murphy's calm and matter-of-fact satisfaction with the calamity he causes is striking.  The surprise ending leaves the viewers with an obvious message...sometimes you have to become evil to fight evil.
