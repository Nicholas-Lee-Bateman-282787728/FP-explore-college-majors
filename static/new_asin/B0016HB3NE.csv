8262493,1,B0016HB3NE,"Smaltzy, simple, stilted, short.  I went into this thinking it was a real movie.  Instead it reminded me of a high school project, or at best, like a film they might show at a church social.",1357430400,,190,4.25
8262494,5,B0016HB3NE,"This is such a great short film.  Awesome story,  and touching performances.  I would recommend this for anyone.  It's refreshing to see some quality stories come out of hollywood",1341100800,2,179,5.068965517241379
8262495,5,B0016HB3NE,"This a 25 minute movie that should be made into a full length feature film by Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard or Tom Hanks.  Even Kevin Costner.  It would make The Bridges of Madison County look like a comedy.  It is a winner and beautifully shot.  The cinematogrephy is fantastic.  It was shot upin Idyllwild Calif.  A winner that has won at last count aprox 4 or 5 film festival awards.  What a shame if this never gets made into a full length feature.",1255392000,2,449,4.337349397590361
