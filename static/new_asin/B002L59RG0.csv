8372440,5,B002L59RG0,"Although I read the initial rather poor reviews on this and dismissed it, I recently read another review that changed my mind. While it wasn't raving, it was a rather positive review. I ordered it and was riveted to the story.

I will enjoy this program for years.",1355270400,4,472,4.564705882352941
