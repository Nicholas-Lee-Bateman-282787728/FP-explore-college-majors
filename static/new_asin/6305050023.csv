966000,5,6305050023,"Excellent Film , I thought Paul Newman played a very interesting part, This is when Reese Witherspoon made her Career, and Susan Sarandon she suits the indirect role",1354233600,,165,4.928571428571429
966001,5,6305050023,"Not alot of car chases, explosions, or jiggly bits,just a GREAT, SOLID bit of noir that will keep those with any sort of attention span entertained. Great acting from a cast of pros! We need more FILMS like this!",1322784000,,212,4.461538461538462
966002,3,6305050023,"There is a terrific cast here, and their acting is as good as usual.  The story is good enough to keep you interested, but not really any better than a typical episode of some old detective show like the Rockford Files or Hart to Hart.  It's not really about solving the crime from clues, but just Newman getting involved in murders and beat up, and I figured out who the real bad guy was right away.  But if you're a fan of Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, or James Garner, you'll get to see good acting by all of them.  And even if you're not, you'll get to see both Sarandon and Reese Witherspoon naked in the same movie.",1189209600,11,653,4.327868852459017
966003,3,6305050023,"But I love Paul Newman.  He can do no wrong.  This is not a bad movie, but it could use a little more suspense, less buffoon from Giancarlo.",1040083200,,140,3.9642857142857144
966004,5,6305050023,"I can't believe how much people focus on Paul Newman in this movie.  Gene Hackman is great.  70 year old actors are more capable than younger actors.  Susan Sarandon looks wonderful...  Stockard Channing has a great chemistry with Paul Newman.  This movie will take you away to a place where loyalty still means something and people care about each other. James Gardner plays his part well. I don't like to reveal too much with a mystery, the other supporting characters are good.  This is a gritty, true to life mystery.  Reese Witherspoon was very fortunate to have this as one of her first movies, anyone with any sense would have taken their clothes off to work with this cast!  She plays the spoiled daughter well. It compares to LA Confidential in my experience...",998092800,25,770,4.7368421052631575
966005,5,6305050023,"How anyone could have found fault in this superior ""gumshoe"" flick is beyond me! Newman, Hackman, Sarandon, Witherspoon, Schrieber, Channing, Esposito, and Garner (in the film's best role) are flawless.  ""Twilight"" is a brilliant exercise in mystery with homage to the passage of time of which we all must travel.
The cast of ""old school"" performers can really give up-and-comers like Damon, Hudson, and Paltrow serious acting lessons.",969753600,,435,5.397058823529412
966006,1,6305050023,Other than Reese Witherspoon's revealing scenes in the beginning of the movie the movie lacks any story that is worth watching!,963360000,2,127,5.095238095238095
966007,4,6305050023,Twilight is a very good who done it. This movie has a very strong cast with a storyline that keeps you guessing.  Paul Newman is his ususal tough guy self and puts in a good effort.  You also get a treat in the very  begening with Reese Witherspoon showing some skin right off the bat.,954288000,,285,4.1454545454545455

966108,5,6305050023,"I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot.

Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway.  Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton""s earlier, very good ""Late Show"", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton""s own aging?).",1452902400,3,722,4.861788617886178
966109,3,6305050023,"Man goes to Mexico to kidnap the daughter of a married couple friend. The girl has ran off with some low life. We watch the after of this and the before. Lots of people get shot with lots of blood all over them. Lots of female naked scenes--Witherspoon and Sarandon.

This movie had a very loose plot. You could kinda follow it. But not really. There were lots of holes. Just seemed like a typical Hackman movie with a lot of swearing, blood, and callus people.",1446336000,,461,4.3604651162790695

966115,5,6305050023,"This was a classic Hollywood movie, that didn't go crazy trying to be unique, yet delivered a very entertaining experience that made it stand out as a quality drama. The stars are all established talent, and their performances shine, especially in the measured, thoughtful dialogue that keeps the movie brooding along.",1384300800,3,318,5.254901960784314

7882996,5,6305050023,"A modern revisit to the noir detective stories of classic Hollywood, this is one of the most under-rated movies I've seen. Twilight was not a hit when it came out, does not come around on cable, and I've never heard anyone talk about it. It's true that the plot has few surprises and the pace is relaxed, but the writer/director filled the cast with the kind of superlative actors who can take a simple little scene and make it utterly fascinating. Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, and James Garner play people who are getting on in years and may not be as fast and as energetic as they used to be, but have lost not one scintilla of their wits and charisma. You'll enjoy simply spending time with these characters as they flirt, tease, and grouse at each other, and who are as fond of each other when they're enemies as they are when friends. Supporting roles include Stockard Channing, John Spencer, Margo Matindale, and before they were stars, Liev Schrieber and Reese Witherspoon. Watching Twilight is an experience in unpretentious class.",1526169600,,1053,4.759562841530054

7883000,5,6305050023,"Throw back to the black n white days of Bogey and Bacall. Only in color and the actors are fantastic. Nostalgic music. Big movie buff. First viewing. And as actors do the circuit for their movie release, I remember Diane Sawyer interviewing Sarandon about being naked in the pool. So glad to have finally watched it. Newman a long time fave, never disappoints. Must see.",1498089600,,370,4.707692307692308

7883003,5,6305050023,"I just do not remember this movie from when it was released. I wasn't going to movies that much in those days, or perhaps it is because it did not receive much acclaim; I do not know why this is a new find for me.
But I am glad I did. It is taunt, closely scripted, well directed and acted, and simply a great balance of script, acting, and directing.",1488585600,,351,4.0285714285714285
