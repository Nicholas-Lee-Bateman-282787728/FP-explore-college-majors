8347274,5,B001W8GVRK,"I first saw Grant Turner on a TV show, gosh, it must have been in the 1980s, called ""Comedy On The Road."" The show was done, that particular episode, at a place in Atlanta called ""The Punch Line."" I enjoyed Grant Turner so much that I contacted the broadcaster and ordered a VHS copy of the episode. There is no telling how many times I've told people about this guy, and even showed them his act in that video.

I never knew, though, why in his act he said that they had told him, ""Get up there, Ricky, and save our butts."" Now, I know.

Several months ago I went on an online search of what had come of Grant Turner, which is how I found out he is now a regular at the Alabama Theater in Myrtle Beach, with his act as Ricky Mokel. What a crack-up, he is! After having watched several clips of ""Ricky Mokel"" on Youtube I just had to buy the DVD. My wife and I have watched this a couple of times already and really enjoyed it.

Good, clean humor that you'll really enjoy!",1341446400,3,977,4.099476439790576
