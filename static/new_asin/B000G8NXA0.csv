2895020,4,B000G8NXA0,Can anyone tell me if Buddy Rich or Louie Bellson or Grand Funk Railroad is on this Box set,1152835200,,91,3.8421052631578947
2895021,4,B000G8NXA0,"I've been waiting for someone to acquire the rights to this for many years! There were actually 2 Playboy After Dark shows produced. The first aired in syndication in the late 1950's and used as its format the idea of you being invited to a swanky Chicago bachelor pad (in reality a Chicago tv studio) with your host being Hugh Hefner himself welcoming you to a typical evening's party at which you never knew who might turn up. People like Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Fitzgerald or even Lenny Bruce might be convinced to get up and ""do their thing"". This show had a definite jazz-flavor to it and its voyeuristic-feel might seem pretty cheesy at first glance until you realize just how many of the people seen here are no longer with us and to see them in a loose-format setting is something special.

The second Playboy After Dark aired in the late 1960's and had a much more rock and roll feel to it. This time the show originated from Los Angeles (since the magazine was now based there) but the ""party at Hef's"" format was largely the same and variety of talent just as fascinating. Although there's no indication of which shows are included here I've seen bootleg footage from the series and hope these sets include bands like The Grateful Dead, Deep Purple (pre-""Smoke on the Water""), The Byrds (Sweetheart of the Rodeo-era), as well as Linda Ronstadt (in her early-70's ""Hand Sown-Home Grown"" look, when she was GORGEOUS!)

And oh, yeah, there's Playmates too, but these aren't ""The Girls Next Door""!

These are definitley time-capsule performaces! I can only hope this is the first of several volumes.",1151193600,13,1604,4.701067615658363
2895022,5,B000G8NXA0,"I bought a copy for my husband who had been a fan of this show for years.  Years ago he had seen a bootleg copy of The Grateful Dead and for years has talked about the series as he remembered it.  So when I read a review I rushed out to get  a copy for my husband.  He was thrilled and overjoyed to be revisiting this retro network TV series.  We both watched the 1st 2 discs together and I couldn't believe the whole very cool atmosphere.  I especially like the variety, the entertainment, the stars!!!  Wow, Joe Cocker, Linda Ronstadt, Ike & Tina Turner...fabulous!  I'm a big fan of Sammy Davis Jr. now after watching this set.  We can't wait to look at Disc 3.  The booklet included is just a fun and interesting read.  What a blast from the past!  I can't wait for more from this series of TV shows.",1156809600,10,804,4.183006535947713
2895023,3,B000G8NXA0,"Problem with Hugh Hefner is that he's always been a pompous, self-deluded bore. In every interview he never tires of repeating the same lines that Playboy has been responsible for seismic sociological changes in the Western world. What he never admits is what everyone knows: that his fortune, empire and celebrity are solely based on providing visual aids to lonely masturbators. The ""man who reads Playboy"" is not a sophisticate in a penthouse with expensive brandy and the latest jazz album. He's in the john with a jar of Vaseline. Hefner's genius, if you can call it that, is that he put a glossy patina on the old stroke book, and gave some dignity to the nervous guy approaching the newsstand vendor with his dirty magazine. Playboy's ridiculous deception continued with its two television shows, Playboy's Penthouse in 1959-1960, and its reincarnation, Playboy After Dark from 1968-1970. Here the public relations scam was in full force. In the first show, Hefner, in a fancy tux, uses a sort of cinema verite' technique to include the viewer as the fourth wall of the set, a well-appointed high-rise apartment. It's a ""you-are-there"" technique and it's quite interesting (and revolutionary, even for today). Trying to appear as a rakish man-about-town, host Hefner comes off as highly comical and misplaced. In fact, ""Hef"" looks like the parking lot attendant who snuck into his uncle's pad and is helping himself to the booze and smokes. He's clearly uncomfortable in front of the cameras. What's more, Hefner's a funny looking guy, with a scrawny build and a big nose and beady eyes and he uses big words that confuse his Playmates. Two shows are included from the 1959-1960 tryout, including the pilot and a later show with the always annoying Sammy Davis Jr. Uninteresting guests like Rona Jaffee, the writer,  and Lenny Bruce, the overrated comic,  chew the fat with Hefner and prove dull, tedious celebrities weren't invented with Jay Leno and The Tonight Show. Some good musical interludes with Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and especially Cy Coleman (who wrote the great theme song) bring much-needed relief from the free-form gabbing. The 1959-1960 show did not syndicate well, and it wouldn't be until 1968 that Playboy went back on the boob tube. But what a difference those few years made!! Never did America change so much as it did in those few tumultuous years. It's like Dorothy going from black-and-white Kansas to the land of Oz. In bright, garish psychedelic tones, with an emphasis on loud rock instead of cool jazz, with scantily clad extras instead of formal wear debutantes, the new Playboy show was a real feast for the eyes. I don't think the glorious two-story set has ever been matched on television; it's very impressive. Hefner is much better on this show, more self-effacing and relaxed, and much more willing to let the guest stars do the entertaining. Four of these latter shows are included. It's interesting how the women were used in Playboy After Dark, as totally subservient to the guys in every way, and mostly as eye candy and background ""atmosphere."" In fact, you can say Playboy After Dark was the lasp gasp of male chauvinism on TV before the harridans of political correctness put an end to all the fun. The guys never had it so good, lounging around, smoking and boozing and laughing at their own jokes as they get plastered. The women, heavily made up, giggle and jiggle and make wide eyes to everything the guys do, even when Hefner and artist Leroy Neiman, for instance,  make ""intellectual"" conversation they can't comprehend. Like the first show, the musical guests are the saving grace, with Tina Turner, Linda Rondstadt, Joe Cocker and Canned Heat really belting out some great performances. Jerry Lewis also turns in a surprisingly good comic turn, mecifully breaking into Sammy Davis' overlong segment. (The Rat Pack were a pain in the neck, let's admit it.) Hefner friend Mort Sahl, the satirist, lays a big egg as he scribbles on a blackboard and attempts to inform the bimbos about the difference between Chinese communists and America's military. (A real party pooper, to be sure.) As far as entertainment value, these show really don't exceed the talk shows of today, which is to say they are only mildly entertaining. Let's face it, celebrities are mostly stupid and boring, uneducated dolts full of themselves who got lucky with a nice set of teeth or a round behind or a good press agent. What makes this expensive DVD package possibly worth owning is its great pop culture historical value. Playboy was ever-so-trendy, and these discs are incredible time capsules of a vanished time: the look, sound, attitude, idioms, turn-ons and turn-offs of the happening crowd. (The only ""extra"" in the DVD set is an interview with the now 80-year-old Hugh Hefner where the old windbag repeats his life story line-for-line from previous interviews and seems too confident of his exalted role in history. The anonymous interviewer is so captivated he seems on the verge of performing one of those unnatural sex acts the magazine is always encouraging.)",1156550400,24,5111,4.954545454545454
2895024,5,B000G8NXA0,"This was so much fun to watch.  The best parts aside from the music, is spotting all the future stars sitting around at the party.  I won't give away who they are, but I was able to spot at least 3 of them.  The mastering is great on this and Sammy Davis steals the show!",1155081600,14,271,3.890909090909091
2895025,5,B000G8NXA0,"I couldn't wait to watch these nostalgic shows and reminisce and this set is more than I expected. The great (one of a kind) performances and music are only part of the enjoyment; these shows are a virtual historical document of a special era.  The fashionable dress (young, beautiful, carefully quaffed women in cocktail dresses and guys in tuxedos and suits, cigarette smoke fills the air, and the booze freely flows).  The hip comics, some working at their peak and others in the development stages of their careers; the classic lounge acts doing their well rehearsed and perfectly timed routines.  And, then there are the stars, the biggest stars of the time from stage, TV, movies and music and the young stars of tomorrow; it's revealing to watch Cher before she evolved into ""Cher"" and fascinating to see the young, fragile and soulful Tina Turner.

I am especially impressed with the moments that capture, what have to be,  the one and only time many of these performers worked together; a young Linda Rondstadt and a mature Billy Eckstine sitting at the piano doing ""God Bless the Child"" - I can't imagine that magic duet was ever repeated anywhere else, for that matter the segment featuring Sammy Davis Jr., Anthony Newley and Jerry Lewis displaying true comic and musical genius is a captured treasure.

I viewed the entire set in one sitting and am eager to see what Playboy will offer next.  In a modern world of faux celebrity and studio enhanced recording artists, it's refreshing to be reminded of what qualifies as quality entertainment.  By the way, Hugh Hefner appears very much at ease as host of the eclectic blend of guests.",1154649600,25,1647,4.815602836879433
2895026,5,B000G8NXA0,"I've been waiting for a long time to see these shows.  I picked mine up yesterday at Tower and it's better than I remember.  If you are buying these 3 dvd's for the rock music you have missed the boat and the party!  The whole Penthouse and Playboy After Dark shows are one big party with beautiful women, men and some great entertainers and singers all mixing together.  This isn't any rock collection, this is a party with everyone mixing together.  I love the music, watching a bare footed Linda Rondstadt doing a song with Billy Eckstein is priceless.  I love the Sonny & Cher and I barely remember Ike & Tina Turner looking like that but man can they cook.  I've never been a big fan of Sammy Davis Jr. but I am now.  The same with Lenny Bruce.  What a riot!  If you are looking for a rock and roll collection, go find a KTEL video.  This is the stuff of legends and one of a kind and I for one am glad this is out and can't wait for the next shows to be out on dvd.  Were the skirts really that short then?",1154476800,15,1012,4.081218274111675

2895029,4,B000G8NXA0,"The P.A.D. clips I have seen of in the past have had excellent music segments with a crisp visual look, which indeed serves as a time machine segment; that recorded excellent material at a time, when more should have been recorded, but the mind set and technology just wasn't in place. I am pleased that this material has lasted, and indeed rescued. What I have seen in the past, musically on the show, has been great and I ONLY HOPE that the Good Stuff makes this edition! Example: Seeing Joe Cocker with his funky back-up band. Linda Ronstadt singing ""God Bless The Child"", (Lady Day style) with this prestigious jazz vocalist from the Biliie Holiday era. And it was a time when, Linda was young, glamerous, swinging, perky -I mean where else are you going to find material like that???? A good addition to any collector's library.",1154131200,4,833,4.673469387755102

2895031,5,B000G8NXA0,"I have waited for years for a great copy of this show. Although i was too young to remember this show when it originally aired. I discovered it in the 90s i started collecting classic rock videos and some of this stuff was on it and i loved it!

8208000,5,B000G8NXA0,Rare footage of the first Playboy show featuring stars of the day stopping by to perform. Really enjoyed seeing the jazz stars!,1384300800,,127,4.818181818181818
8208001,4,B000G8NXA0,"First, you should buy this DVD ONLY if you were a teen in the late 60s and can remember what Playboy stood for back then. I'm sure this DVD has the same relevance to anyone who didn't grow up in that era as the DVDs of the Honeymooner's TV Series does for the parent's of the Baby Boomer.

This DVD is really a time capsule that helps those who remember when today's faults of masculinity were overlooked and ignored. Those of you who are devoted fans of the AMC series MAD MEN should find Vol 2 (from the series shot in the late 60s) proves MAD MEN successfully captured the era that launched many young men toward styles in fashion, music and lifestyle that marked our generation for over forty years (1950 -1990)

Yes, the women are beautiful and air headed. Yes, Hef's guests were the best and the worst of the era. Yes, you might look at the extra's and be surprised to find a face that later became a movie legemd. Yes, you may be embarrassed by Hef's demeanor and posing but back then NO ONE spoke to men's libidos with more force and influence than Hugh Hefner.

My reason for buying this DVD collection was pure nostalgia. My father passed away and he 'allowed' me to watch this late night program over my mother's strenuous objections. I still fondly remember my Dad leaving the TV channel set on PAD and heading up to bed after throwing me a sly knowing glance.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see a slice of Americana that  should be called the first shot of the era's sexual revolution and the man that kept it's light burning bright. If you wonders how Hef wants to spend the rest of eternity in the after life then buy and watch this DVD.",1195603200,3,1666,4.344051446945338
8208002,5,B000G8NXA0,"I had heard of this set and finally purchased it. The overall production and style is almost impossible to describe. I am sure when I have enjoyed a DVD more in recent years. Some of the Dick Cavett comes close.

The first disc with shows from 1959/1960 maybe the best. It takes many viewings to really capture all that is going on. I encourage anyone to watch once just to pay attention to the people on the sides or background. Many are clearly working hard to try to look cool. Some are doing a great job, and a few got started early with the pre-show drinks, as Hefner noted in a bonus interview was real alcohol during the filming. A few shots are tough to catch every detail just for the heavy haze of smoke in the area. This is real footage without a hint of augmentation or editing.

The best moments early on is the 15+ minutes with Lenny Bruce. This maybe the best single documentation of his real work on film. When Nat King Cole shows up to sit in on the chat the wonderful fun continues.

We really are the fly on the wall to this environment and I spent many minutes in true amazement in being given the chance to witness these broadcasts. Watch the girl sitting at the piano in the first half of episode one. Is she acting or not, or simply drunk with the moment as we might have been too. The early moment when Hefner takes a phone call is priceless, and frankly doesn't feel scripted, though it must have been.

The pieces with Ella Fitzgerald and then Sammy Davis Jr. are almost impossible to put a value on.

There isn't a moment of inappropriate activity given it is Playboy, but that would have only cheapened the presentation. This is brilliant TV and DVD production at the absolute finest. Get it and enjoy.",1192665600,5,1730,4.376947040498442
8208003,4,B000G8NXA0,"Watched this Playboy after Dark at a friends house a few weeks ago, it is a hoot.  Really interesting how Hef got his start with the magazine and then progressed into entertainment.  When I was a little kid I remember watching this on the old black & white TV.  Vary tame show, but excellent entertainment, rent it or buy it, you will enjoy.  Nat King Cole is excellent, he is Natalie Cole's Dad.  The King lives, and not Elvis!",1191628800,2,428,4.367088607594937
8208004,5,B000G8NXA0,"Just got volume two (after loving volume one) and its even better than the first! The Grateful Dead and Deep Purple really take you back to that ""moment in time"". I also particularly like that they have stuff from ""Playboy's Penthouse""-- Tony Bennett, Joe Williams, and Count Basie are outstanding!

I know that there are tons of episodes out there, so please keep 'em coming, they're terriffic!",1179360000,2,395,4.895522388059701
8208005,5,B000G8NXA0,"Take a ride up the elevator and a trip back in time to party at the Rumpus Room with Hugh, the playmates, and hip guests including Lenny Bruce, Ella Fitzgerald, Linda Ronstadt, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joe Cocker, and LeRoy Neiman. The booze was flowin' and the cigarettes were smokin' during this late-night variety/talk show/dance party that was on the cutting edge at the time, and still seems fresh and a little subversive today. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore, folks... and that's a damn shame. Please keep 'em coming, Hef! (Definitely skip the insufferable interview ""bonus feature,"" though...)",1166140800,2,605,5.06
8208006,5,B000G8NXA0,One must watch this DVD on a Big Screen with Theater Surround Sound. You will feel as if you are right there in the cocktail party.  That is the true genius of Playboy's Penthouse and Playboy After Dark. The performance of Sammy Davis Jr. on the first disk is one of the best live performances of Sammy Davis you will ever see. One can hope that a full DVD set will be released in the future. Hugh Hefner worked hard and played hard too. These programs are a goldmine of music and comedy from an age when one had to have true talent to survive in showbiz,1163548800,4,554,4.177570093457944
