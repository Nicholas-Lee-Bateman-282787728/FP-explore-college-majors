8164699,5,B000LWHMT4,"Whether you're a beginner or advanced stepper, this is the best workout. It is all step and she explains and calls out the moves in a way that makes it easy for you to keep up. The routines (a little difficult at first if you're brand new to step) are effective enough to do with or w/o a step. This was the first step video I got when I started stepping about 8 yrs ago. When i moved, it got lost somehow but I love it so much I bought it again, even though it only comes in vhs form. I have other step dvd's but none as fun, effective, and about the business as this one. You want a step workout that is all step, you can use at any level of fitness for years to come, has a great bonus ab routine (and extremely effective one), that you don't need extra equipment to use, will help you lose weight while shaping and toning your lower body, then this is the best buy.",1371945600,,869,4.0

she has several workouts, she is the best.",1332374400,,157,4.233333333333333
8164701,5,B000LWHMT4,"First of all, let me say I am an intermediate to advanced stepper.  Second, I will say this is possibly the most intense step video I have ever done.  I've found that with other videos (e.g. Kathy Smith, Gin Miller, etc) my heart rate will get up, but I'm never working 100%.  With Cathe, however, I am definitely breathing hard the whole way through.  It's high energy and power moves almost from the get go (I haven't tried, but you could turn down the intensity by leaving out the power - i.e. just stepping up rather than hopping).

The moves are somewhat advanced in my opinion (""repeater"" is about the simplest move she does).  I did this workout about 4 times before I actually got them all down, and Cathe doesn't really demo them.  That said, the moves aren't so complex that I've had to put my VCR on slow motion to get them, and you can pick them up just by muddling through a few times.

There's a nice looking weight training segment at the end, which I haven't gotten around to doing yet (every time I get done with the step portion I'm so exerted, I just want to call it a day!)  But, there's workouts for arms, bust, and abs (they don't look any easier than the step workout!)

Cathe and her cast of fit-looking steppers definitely appear to be getting into it and having fun.  And if you have plenty of energy to spare and are up for a challenge, it is a real ride.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Cathe if you're looking to take ""power step"" to the next level.",1270166400,,1485,4.340579710144928
8164702,3,B000LWHMT4,I normally love Cathe's routines but I wasn't feeling this workout too much.  The step routine was a little fast for my liking but the toning routine was okay.,1213660800,,159,4.482758620689655
8164703,5,B000LWHMT4,"This workout has been out for a while but I didn't see a breakdown of it, so I'll add a review:

This workout is perfect if you have good cardio stamina but don't like complex step choregraphy. The choregraphy is intermediate level. No complex twirls in every direction, but not enough instruction for someone who's never done step before. The routines won't be outgrown too fast, yet they are ""do-able"" and not overwhelmingly hard. She calls out moves from her Basic Step video that she assumes you already know, like ""basic"" and ""corner to corner,"" that sort of thing.

Start simply, build combo 1, then take combo 1 from the top.
Start simply again, build combo 2, then take combo 2 from the top.
Finally, put 1 & 2 together, run through those a few times.

Then there's a brief cool down. You don't cool down all the way because you do the weight lifting next. If you don't want to do the weights, you'll need to cool down more on your own.

As she builds each combo, she's building from lower impact version to higher impact version. If you don't want to do high impact you can continue doing the low impact move. (For example choose between horseshoe turn and power horse. Power horse involves a jump.)

The set looks like Roman ruins. There are columns behind Cathe, as you can see on the cover, and off to the side it looks like columns are not completely dug out of the natural rock, so there's a rock formation to the side. Music is ""world beat"" style instrumental.

Cathe's cueing is perfect as usual. There's some ""whoo""ing, but I don't mind that.

A really fun workout!",1201824000,,1582,4.510489510489511
8164704,5,B000LWHMT4,THIS TAPE IS GREAT.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS TAPE IS TRUE TO THE WAY CATHE ALWAYS TRAIN.,1199664000,,86,4.375
