The setting is rural India, and many of the characters have skeletons in their past. SBAG is about the Biwi ( Mahie Gill), her husband Saheb ( Jimmy Shergil) and the gansgster ( Randeep Hooda). The  Saheb is royalty but all he has left is prestige and a empty purse, he lives lavishly but does not have the cash flow for his lifestyle. He also has a mistress ( Shreya Narayan) who competes with his wife for attention. An accident forces the old driver to be replaced with a younger driver, who is a seed of a rival gang. The younger driver is opportunistic and falls in love with the emotionally unstable Biwi.
One gets drawn in to this world right from the start, the messed up relationships, the hidden agendas are all intriguing. The first half was amazing but the second half (despite several loose ends) was also great. The final twist is simply superb reminiscent of a James Hadley Chase novel. The film worked for me because of the mystery, the story line and the dialogues.
All of the actors have played their part and this is one of the reasons that the movie succeeds. The music is good and I cannot understand the reason for its failure. SBAG is a different tale of deceit, intrigue and betrayal. The unpredictable ending and the journey culminating to it make this film a worthwhile watch.  I am waiting for the sequel in March 2013.

The script is taut, the performances are very good and the goings on very real. In today's times many good movies go unnoticed because of ineffective marketing, and for effective marketing, one needs money. One can not call this movie a suspense... thriller, but there is an element of surprise and unpredictability through most of it. One may perhaps call it a ""twist thriller"". I am no Mahie Gill fan and am pretty sure that histrionics was not the reason why she was cast in that role - it was affordability. The role demands that the actress should look sexy, vulnerable and vicious at various points in the movie and Mahie Gill does not look any of that, at all. Jimmy Shergill has done a good job. I wonder why he is not seen in A class movies, rubbing shoulders with the biggies? The girl who has played ""Mahua"", Jimmy's lover, is pretty suitable for the part and did a good job. Randeep Hooda is commendable. He does not have the looks nor the screen presence to get mainstream roles, so he will have to live with small budget movies. Commendable stuff. Could have been a top grosser had the budget been bigger.",1329436800,,1249,4.458515283842795
