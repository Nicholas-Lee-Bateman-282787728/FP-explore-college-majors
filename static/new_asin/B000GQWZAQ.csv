2615961,5,B000GQWZAQ,The Ageless Yoga Volume 2 video is easy to follow and it truly is for all ages. The instructions are clear and the numerous options allow for a workout at any length and level.,1315180800,,176,4.205882352941177
2615962,5,B000GQWZAQ,I am a senior and new to yoga.  Wanted a little stretching and moving to add to my regular exercise routine.  This is great - has a selection of longer and of shorter segments and describes each so you can select what you want that day depending on energy level and time.  The mood of the routine is very pleasant and relaxing.  I love it.,1279584000,3,339,4.1692307692307695
2615963,2,B000GQWZAQ,I am baffled over the rave reviews of this DVD set.  I purchased the set as I teach several different types of yoga classes and wanted to observe some techniques for teaching a chair/standing class.  This set is horrible.  The instructor's teaching technique is so poor I had a hard time watching the entire program.,1276041600,,316,4.709090909090909
2615964,5,B000GQWZAQ,"Being a somewhat sedentary Boomer, with various aches, pains and balance issues, I wanted something that would address these problems. When another user commented on help with migraines, from which I've suffered for 45+ years, I had to give this DVD a try.

Having dabbled in yoga over the decades there are only a few moves that, to me, are mindful of my previous yoga experience. Thus, I found the title a tad misleading. Regardless of what they're called, my body always benefits from the different movements, positions, and blend of stretches. I don't find any of the routines particularly difficult but a few are gently challenging. I try to devote time every morning and eve to one or more of the routines, and, even without the DVD, often do some of the moves during the day when I feel myself getting tense or stressed (with positive results).

The production value is nothing fancy. John's demeanor is pleasant and lighthearted. The casually-attired participants, who are very average people, make the DVD very relate-able. The relaxation and meditation segments are a must!",1271980800,5,1083,4.9779005524861875
2615965,5,B000GQWZAQ,"I bought this DVD 2 years ago and since then I have used it consistently 4-5 times a week. At the very same time, I purchased several other Beginning Yoga DVDs and I do not use these at all. Why does Ageless Yoga work for me while the other DVDs don't? Well... I must admit I'm not in athletic shape, and using the other DVDs involves holding postures that are weight bearing, and other movements that requires greater balance and flexiblility than I usually have on a given day. In contrast, the various routines in Ageless Yoga are gentle, short, can be done anytime and without any props, and they make my body feel good during and afterwards. The instructor has an earnest and caring style of explaning the movements, and he has a calming voice. Ageless Yoga has decent overall production quality (audio, video, editing) and the DVD menus work reliably. Another contrast from some the other DVDs I purchased is that there are no hotsy-totsy Yoga models to get you all excited (or depressed).",1224720000,12,995,4.659090909090909
2615966,5,B000GQWZAQ,"Wonderful DVD's. Six weeks ago I decided that the pain from my osteoarthritic hip and back had become too much to bear. I felt that my body needed authentic healing beyond pain killers or surgery. I had read that yoga is an excellent treatment for arthritis, but how could I do yoga as crippled as I was? John's approach has become my answer. His gentle, immediately engaging instruction takes the student clearly and concisely through techniques of breathing, meditation and movement that have the combined effect of gradually freeing the joints, reducing pain, increasing strength and lightening the spirit. Because of such noticeable improvement in my own condition, I am gaining confidence that I might be able to work toward actually healing a condition that is normally described as degenerative. I highly recommend John's program for anyone at all - and particularly for those who feel weak, confined or hopeless because of their age or disability. Whatever your limitations are, I'm confident that you will derive great benefit both physically and emotionally from these excellent DVD's.",1177545600,22,1095,5.2272727272727275

2615968,5,B000GQWZAQ,"John, I am grateful for your DVD's as my grandmother has been using them almost everyday since they have hit the market. Prior to your DVD's, she used your VHS tapes for many years. As a senior in her mid 80's, these excercises have been essential for her well being. My parents and I have also found your Yoga excercises to be quite helpful as well. It is rare to find a Yoga Approach which is suitable for 3 generations. Kudos to you and again thank you!",1157673600,17,456,4.252873563218391
2615969,5,B000GQWZAQ,I have found John Schlorholtz's Floor & Standing Yoga DVD's to be an excellent form of exercise and flexibility training. The way he has organized the DVD's--with many options for types and lengths of routines--makes if very easy to work the routines into a busy lifestyle. I don't know of any Yoga video that has quite the flexibility and options that this one has.,1155686400,18,366,4.734375
8133923,5,B000GQWZAQ,"Excellent, quick routines to get you moving in the morning and keep you moving all day long.  VERY pleased with this DVD!",1479081600,,121,4.5

8133925,4,B000GQWZAQ,"For all those seniors out there that need to get limber, stronger in a safe way, they should try this and he also has one using a chair.  Folks that might have a knee problem, etc. should look at his exercises.  Safe and easy and they work.....I recommend this!",1428105600,,261,4.3061224489795915
8133926,5,B000GQWZAQ,"Fantastic DVD for seniors. I love it and can do a little every day .
All senior levels catered for.",1423267200,,99,4.0
8133927,5,B000GQWZAQ,"I'm a 73 year old female and have studied Yoga for over 13 years from the same excellent Yoga instructor. I was looking for a Yoga DVD that I could work with when I couldn't go to my class. Mr. Schlorholtz's DVD and instructions are perfect for me. I like that I can choose between a gentle workout or a more challenging one, a short 35 minute class or a longer 80 minute class. His instructions are clear and simple, he encourages the viewer to mind how they feel in the poses and moves, and cautions against causing harm to oneself. Mr. Schlorholtz is an ideal Yoga instructor for all ages and for a variety of Yoga practices, and I wish to thank him for this.",1421625600,,662,4.261904761904762
8133928,4,B000GQWZAQ,"I now work from my home and needed something to get me back into yoga. This just what I wanted.
There's no silly music, no weird instructor, everything is geared for seniors or any beginner. There are different levels of yoga, for stress relief, stretching etc. The demostraters are not beautiful young women doing things I haven't done in years, if ever. This is just yoga for beginners. Plain and simple.",1396742400,3,406,4.732394366197183
8133929,5,B000GQWZAQ,"I've done a lot of yoga in my life, and I've been to many physical therapists off and on for various issues. John Schlorholtz combines the best that all of these have to offer. I work his routines every morning and they keep my creaking oldish body humming along. 26 minutes a day is all that's required!

He's the best!!",1370908800,,321,4.35
8133930,1,B000GQWZAQ,"Not at all what I was expecting. Look and feel like a very old dvd, the method and people are very old fashioned. Not for me",1363564800,2,124,3.8076923076923075
8133931,5,B000GQWZAQ,This is just what we need. Both my husband and I are seniors and this is so good for us. There are so many routines to choose from that are within our physical range. We received another yoga routine for Christmas and even though it was a beginner routine we could not do even a small part of it. Good product. Worth the money.,1359504000,,327,4.125
8133932,4,B000GQWZAQ,Easy to follow menu and the instruction given by the tutor i like the variety of the exercises  shown by the instructor.,1330214400,,120,4.454545454545454
