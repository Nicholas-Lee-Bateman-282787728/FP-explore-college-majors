8288614,3,B001CQ5PC4,"I bought this based on a blog claiming it was a bigfoot movie (it's not) and was pleasantly surprised.

4 friends go on a camping trip to help one of them get over a divorce. After some drinking and conversation, they run into 4 younger women and they hang out. The divorcee goes to relieve himself and comes across a guy missing his legs (seen at the start of the movie running from the beast.) From there, the group starts dropping to the beast that kind of looks like a Minotaur.

There a decent amount of blood, gore & attacks. The final death of the creature is a little lame. But the ending leaves us with the chance of another.

Overall the movie has decent acting, decent FX (the creature looks a little silly at times but it is far better watching this here than CGI), the movie moves at a good pace. Hopefully the director and production company did well enough to move on to bigger & better projects.",1477440000,,911,4.347058823529411

8288616,1,B001CQ5PC4,"I've been a fan of horror movies for 20 years now and during that time have seen many B-Grade horror films that, despite lower production values and below average acting, were enjoyable, Prey for the Beast sadly is not one of them.

The basic story follows a group of guys who are eager to head out on a camping trip to help their friend Budd get over his divorce with a cheating wife. While out in the woods they come across another group, four beautiful young ladies, who are away for a weekend of fun in the wild. After discovering a body in the wilderness they discover they aren't alone as a hulking beast picks them off one by one.

The creature costume and the gore effects aren't overly good, but being a b-grade horror on a small budget they fit the bill reasonably well. The real problem with Prey for the Beast is the acting and dialogue, not one of the actors manage to give the impression they are in a fight for their lives, nor any concern for their fallen friends and the dialogue comes across as this disjointed mess with very little relevance to the events that are happening around them.

Overall Prey for the Beast takes a tried and true horror formular and manages to make a complete and underwhelming mess of it, hard to recommend to even the biggest lover of b-grade blood and gore flicks.",1297555200,,1312,4.435684647302905
8288617,2,B001CQ5PC4,"Remember that story in ""Trilogy of Terror"" where Karen Black was chased around for 15 minutes by a spear-wielding 1 foot tall native jungle monster-man doll with sharp teeth? Well, if you liked that scene, then you may love this movie, which features an entire island full of hundreds of little buggers that seem to be close cousins to said jungle mo'fo'.

This low-budget period piece film tells the story of a group of people surviving a luxury liner shipwreck only to be stranded on an island full of the horrible aforementioned ""beast creatures""! Most of the running time consists of the survivors being gradually picked-off as they fend for their lives from an onslaught of tiny terror attacks! You will either find this film somewhat creepy or ridiculously hilarious depending on your outlook of such things!",1238889600,,814,4.9416058394160585
