1733274,4,B000069JFY,"How many people went through this in High School?  The need to be popular, the mean girl who everyone is scared of and in awe of at the same time, and adults involved who think that winning is everything.  This story is so real.  As a teacher, I would like to create a curriculum around itto help others learn how to think for themselves and how to develop self worth.  The casting was perfect.  Tori played a good heifer and Kellie has pathetic down pact.",1161734400,11,456,4.317647058823529
1733275,5,B000069JFY,"Kellie Martin plays unpopular high schooler Angela Delveccio, who longs to be part of the ""in"" crowd. She joins as many activities as she can, including The Larks, which is an afterschool service club. Many of the popular girls are Larks, including the nasty Stacy Lockwood (Tori Spelling) who delights in humiliating the lone goth chick at school.

One night, Stacy and Angela get into a fight and Anglea blurts out an embarassing litany of reasons why she's so obsessed with Stacy.  Unsurprisingly, Stacy is creeped out and mocks Angela, saying she's going to tell everyone at school about how weird Angela is. The idea of public humiliation pushes Angela over the edge and she stabs Stacy to death.  The last part of the movie deals with Angela trying to keep her crime a secret from the police while the poor goth chick gets blamed by students for Stacy's death.

I saw this on Lifetime a couple years ago and have been waiting for it to be released on DVD! Kellie really nails the character of the desperate, plain-jane Angela and Tori is perfect as the rich bitch Stacy.",1147392000,58,1076,4.677248677248677

1733277,5,B000069JFY,First saw this made for nbc-tv movie in 1994. Starred Kellie Martin as Angela and Tori Spelling as Stacy. This got great ratings when it initally aired. I was glued to my seat the entire 2 hours. Tori Spelling does an awesome job playing bitchy Stacy Lockwood and Kellie Martin does a great job playing unpopular Angela. If you're a fan of mid-90's tv movies than this is one you should pick up.,1136592000,35,395,4.424657534246576
1733278,4,B000069JFY,"The first time I saw that movie, which was a few years ago, the only thing that had remained printed in my mind was its shock value provided by the murder of Tori Spelling's character (don't worry, this isn't really a spoiler because she dies right at the beginning and the story is then told in flashback). But after watching it again, I can confidently say that this is the most honest and thought-provoking ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie I've seen in my life. This is greatly due to Kellie Martin's pitch-perfect performance as Angela Delvecchio, a Christian high school student who wants nothing more than be the best in everything and become friends with snotty Stacy Lockwood, the school's most popular girl. What the movie so brilliantly exposes is the fact that in today's North American society, you are nothing if you're not rich, beautiful and successful, and Angela's crime is simply the reflection of how peer pressure and society's high expectations can reduce someone's self-esteem to smithereens. A Friend To Die For makes you sort out your priorities in life and realize that there are more important values than perfection and wealthiness. The only thing that keeps me from giving this film 5 stars is the sometimes-poor way in which this film was directed and the ridiculously cheesy soundtrack.",1135209600,6,1313,5.027522935779817
1733279,4,B000069JFY,"...especially for teens. Kellie Martin is perfect as the role of a sweet, smart, hardworking Catholic girl who feels the need to become popular like the snooty, blonde,fakey girl played by, who else, Tori Spelling. Tori's acting isn't the greatest, in my opinion, but Kellie's is great as always. Kellie's character has such an inferiority complex that she goes to extreme lengths in an attempt to get the blonde to let her into her crowd. The end result is devastating. I think this film was based on a true story, but I am not sure. It has a good message.

P.S. I want to let Kellie Martin fans know that I heard on a Down's Syndrome website that Life Goes On, the show that made her a star, is going to be available on dvd this summer. I can't wait to buy it.",1133654400,5,762,4.328671328671328
1733373,4,B000069JFY,"Disappointed in the casting of the two main characters, as the actual victim had brunette hair and the real-life victimizer had blonde hair.  So that threw me a bit, and led me to believe that there were other facts changed as well. Because of that, I found myself checking the internet at every scene, just to verify other facts.  Other than that, it portrayed an intriguing story, and a senseless act of teen violence; important for society to be aware of.

The story also took the point of view of the victimizer, seeing the world through their eyes, so as to capture the essence of the pain that led to this act of violence; resentment and jealousy. The story also revealed that not only does the victim's family suffer, even the victimizer, and the family of the victimizer suffers.  The story is a reminder that compassion for them should not be forgotten.",1514073600,3,862,4.651315789473684

The movie was typical made-for-TV, Lifetime movie quality. Kellie Martin's acting was wooden and unconvincing. Tori Spelling was, as she is in every movie or TV shows she's in, Tori Spelling, rich girl popular simply because she is rich, not because she has any charisma or because she's a decent human being. If you like this type of movie, you will probably like this one. It's watchable. That's the best I can say about it.",1513814400,2,549,4.555555555555555

1733436,5,B000069JFY,"I've liked this movie ever since I caught it on Lifetime years ago and have been wanting to see it again lately.  It's just as great, and in some ways, just as cheesy as I remember.  The acting by Kellie Martin and Valerie Harper is particularly good.  Tori Spelling had some good moments, but I do think she overacts in some places.  What really annoys me is the acting by the people who play Stacy's parents.  Even though they only have a few lines, they don't show the absolute shock, horror and grief any parent would feel after seeing their child severely injured and watching her die.  In the scene where Stacy is taken away in the ambulance just after being stabbed, they just kind of stand in the street with slightly contorted looks on their faces.  They make the same faces in the next scene when they watch their daughter die at the hospital and during the trial scenes.  No tears, no screams, not much of anything.  Most people show more emotion when their pet dies.  But that annoyance aside, the story unfolds well and does a good job of showing the societal pressure Kellie's character Angela was under and that she seemed to simply snap under the weight of it all.  Some people may be a little dismayed that the movie paints Angela's character as the real victim or just as much of a victim as Stacy.  I think the thing to keep in mind is that this movie is really Angela's (Bernadette Protti's) story more than Stacy's (Kirsten Costas') and is basically told from her point of view.",1456963200,4,1499,4.490774907749078
1733437,5,B000069JFY,"Death of a Cheerleader remains one of the all time best, quintessential movies ever aired on the Lifetime network.

Valerie Harper's scenery-chewing, shrill rendition of a rigid Catholic mother (Mrs. Delvecchio) is enough to make you go out and stab somebody, and Crista Miller as Angela DelVecchio's dorky older sister further drives home the motive for the movie's young killer. Eugene Roche is terrific as the town priest, and Terry O'Quinn as Principal Ed Sachs delivers a performance reminiscent of his turn in ""The Stepfather."" Kathryn Pino (""Cold Case"") plays the school goth!

The costume design and art direction help tell the story. The rich girls of Stacy Lockwood's (Tori Spelling) clique dress in blues: breezy cotton, eyelet and denim are accessorized with oodles of pearls of and art deco rhinestone pins and brooches. Poor girl Angela DelVecchio's (Kellie Martin) family dresses and decorates their home in drab browns.

The film has the right balance of high school intrigue and FBI investigation. A cheerleading try out scene AND a lie detector test? Kellie Martin does it all in this.

Honestly one of the best movies ever shown on Lifetime, based on a true story written up in Rolling Stone magazine, and the network doesn't air it anymore, nor do they have it on Roku. Do yourself a favor and own a copy.",1454630400,3,1325,4.954954954954955
1733438,5,B000069JFY,"This is quite a good movie, it's based on a true murder of a cheerleader but how accurate it is to that who knows, this version certainly paints the victim as not a very nice person, and her murderer as, well the bigger victim. I've never been a fan of Tori Spelling, but even though she looks way too old to be a 15 year old student, and a lot older than her other schoolmates, she actually does a good job acting wise.  You're supposed to dislike her as sort of a mean girls type queen, who takes pleasure in humiliating and putting other classmates down and she does a very good job of that, you certainly don't like her character, if someone was going to get killed, well you're happy it's her and not someone else.

Kellie Martin (Life Goes On / ER), plays Angela, a sympathetic well behaved, takes her school work seriously student who has transferred from another school into a sort of cult like school environment that worships being better than everyone else. The school principal or whoever the main academic character was, constantly tells students that second best is not good enough at rallys, over the PA system and when interacting with them one on one.  Angela must be popular, she must succeed, which means getting into the writing club and cheerleading squad and the school's sorority like girls club is crucial to current and future happiness.  When she starts to fail at some of these goals, she decides tricking the queen of the social hierarchy into coming to a party with her will make them both best friends and put her back on track.  When this just creeps out the cheerleader she ditches her leaving Angela with the knowledge she will be the subject of relentless teasing and put downs as Angela has witnessed a goth chick enduring.  Angela decides to make sure that can never happen.

Kellie Martin also does a really good acting job which makes you feel sorry and sort of hope she gets away with murder.  It's not her fault but the movie sort of lacked some scenes that made the fact she's a regular nice caring person, to suddenly she's stabbing someone to death be plausible.  Unless you've watched you won't really know what I mean.  I'd actually rate this four and a half stars due to that but there is no half star option.

This is also a nice movie to recognise many stars who went onto successful TV shows or movie careers as younger actresses. Such as Christa Miller as Angela's sister, who of course a year later would become Kate on the Drew Carey Show and then go onto Scrubs, Cougar Town and other stuff.  Kathryn Morris (Cold Case), Jenna Leigh Green (Sabrina the Teenage Witch) are two other examples but you'll recognise plenty of faces.",1448841600,,2680,4.560416666666667

1733465,3,B000069JFY,"""Death of a Cheerleader"" recounts the true story of the murder of Kirsten Costas by Bernadette Protti, two students at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California, in 1984. Names of persons and places involved are changed in the movie.
  Orinda (Santa Mira) is an affluent, conservative suburb.  Expectations for success and achievement are inordinately high, as expressed in a student assembly by the high school principal.
  Stacy (Kirsten Costas), played by Tori Spelling, is a popular cheerleader and athlete and leader of the Larks social sorority. Angela (Bernadette Protti), played by Kellie Martin, comes from more normal economic means, is smart and likeable, but is obsessed with being liked by Stacy.
  Angela doesn't fit in easily with the hyper-inflated expectations of the affluent environment around her, whereas Stacy thrives in it. Angela wants to be like Stacy even though Stacy tends to be cruel toward those she sees as below her social status.
  Angela is accepted into the Larks sorority but is still rejected by Stacy. When Angela dupes Stacy into going with her to a party one night, she confesses her semi-worship of Stacy, who calls her ""pathetic"" and ""weird"". Angela flips out and stabs Stacy to death.
  It takes six months for the FBI to catch Angela, and then there is a highly publicized trial.
  What the viewer must decide is if this murder is the act of one sick girl or is caused by the distorted values of an affluent community. After all, affluence and its values are the exception, not the norm.",1426291200,2,1533,4.94140625

1733576,2,B000069JFY,"Stacy Lockwood, a cheerleader and the most popular girl at Santa Mira High School, is dead. She dies in hospital after a knife attack by another girl who fled in a car.

That's how ""Death of a Cheerleader"" (also known as ""A Friend to die for"") begins. Then there is a flashback, and we see Stacy and her friends 10 months earlier at the beginning of a new academic year at Santa Mira High School. ""It is excellence"", the high school principal tells the new students, ""second-best is simply not good enough.""

Stacy, the spoilt daughter of rich parents, is one of those who manage ""to be the best"". She is queen bee and openly nasty to anyone she does not like, especially to Monica, a highly unpopular girl who wears black and has her hair dyed.

Another girl who doesn't fit is Angela Delvecchio. Angela is pretty, nice and smart, but she comes from a rather poor family, cannot afford expensive stuff. Angela is nice, shy and insecure and desperately wants to belong. Her idol is ""Queen Bee"" Stacy Lockwood, the daughter of rich parents, a good athlete, cheerleader and the most popular girl at school. Angela is desperate to fit in and determined to be the best - she wants to become a cheerleader, to be on yearbook staff and so on. When she fails, ""her whole world falls apart"" (that is how a friend of the real Angela describes the girl's feelings in one of the articles about the ""cheerleader murder""). Angela adores Stacy and wants to be her friend. When Stacy rejects her and Angela is afraid to be humiliated in front of the whole school by the nasty girl, the good girl turns bad... When Angela is rebuffed by Stacy, she explodes in a rage and stabs Stacy to death.

It is not a bad film - Kellie Martin is marvellous as ""Angela Delvecchio"".

The acting is great and the message is important - it is a film against bullying and peer group pressure.

And yet I cannot like this film. I think it is far too one-sided - Angela is portrayed very well as a nice girl whose desperation drives her over the edge, but what about Stacy? Her role is flat and one-dimensional, she is portrayed as a bully without any redeeming qualities. This film would be great if the crew only had bothered to portray BOTH SIDES. But they didn't, and that's my problem - the film is one-sided, biased, unfair and manipulative.

Don't forget that we only know the killer's side of story, the victim is not alive to defend herself. Her portrayal in this film is very unfair indeed. Whatever she did, she did not deserve to die. Whatever provocation the killer had does not excuse what she did. A 15-year-old who has been murdered deserves sympathy.

The film was based on an article about the cheerleader murder, written by Randall Sullivan. Sullivan frankly admits that he identified with the killer and does not express any sympathy at all for the victim.

It is obvious that the author believed every word the killer said, but the victim's parents didn't. Neither do I. The killer lured the victim out of the house with a cover story, did not say her name and had a knife with her - this sounds very much like planned murder. The victim's parents said that no one would use a foot-and-a-half-long knife to cut tomatoes (the killer claimed that she found the knife only by chance; her older sister testified in court that she used it for slicing vegetables at lunch-time and might have left it in the car)and that Bernadette (the real Angela's name), casually dressed, never intended to take Kirsten (the real Stacy's name) to a party.

If you are interested in the real Angela and the real Stacy, you can find plenty of information via google. In fact, I was rather shocked to see how much you can find out about people who probably want to be left alone. I found the addresses of the killer's parents, the victim's parents, the victim's neighbour's, I found the victim's mother in a pedigree and now I know her maiden name and that she is the daughter of an immigrant from Norway...

Kirsten's and Bernadette's classmates finished high school in 1986 and celebrated their reunion in 2006 (there is a reunion homepage, the school's name is Miramonte). I am sure that many of their former classmates missed Kirsten. She is not forgotten as you can see on the page ""Find a grave"" where many people left flowers for her...

People leave notes like ""I miss you"" and ""To this day, I can't get into a pool without thinking of you"". It seems like Kirsten's friend still miss her, she cannot have been such an evil witch.

Kirsten Costas was only 15. Maybe she was a stupid bitch, but even if she had been the worst brat on earth - she didn't deserve to die. And she was entitled to dislike Bernadette and did not have any obligation to be her friend! Whatever she was like, she paid with her life and that price was far too high.

I was a ""Bernadette"" myself at school, I was green with jealousy, too, and detested all the ""Kirstens"" I knew! But I NEVER harmed anyone. I didn't because I'm sane and normal. The killing was not an act of self-defense, and I think the high school principal was perfectly right when he said the killer was ""a sick kid with serious problems"".

I found many comments that made me see red - I am horrified to see how readily people justify murder. Bloggers who do not even bother to spell the victim's name correctly - it was K-I-R-S-T-E-N, not Kristen or Krista - write things like ""The victim is as guilty as the killer"" and similar rubbish, and one even blames the victim's (!) parents and says they should have taught their daughter to treat others with kindness and respect! How do we know what Kirsten's parents taught their daughter? Maybe Bernadette's parents should have taught their daughter more self-esteem...

Bernadette had no right to kill Kirsten. And competitive world or not - society did not force Bernadette to kill her classmate. It was Bernadette's decision. She could have left Kirsten alone in the first place. She could have accepted the rejection. She could have left the knife at home. She could have slapped Kirsten instead of stabbing her. She could have called an ambulance after she stabbed her. She could have confessed MUCH earlier.

In the film, the killer is described as a ""confused and desperate child"". But the victim was a child as well - and I guess she was ""confused and desperate"", too, when she felt the knife penetrating her lungs and liver and when she was bleeding to death! I totally agree with the FBI man who (in the film) says ""Feel sorry for the girl she killed!""

Bernadette turned herself in - but she only did so after the FBI had figured out that she was the killer. Before her confession, she deceived everyone for six months - and allowed the blame to rest on others.

The worst scene in the film is the one showing the Delvecchio family having a celebration shortly before Christmas. They thoroughly enjoy themselves - with the exception of Angela, of course, who knows that the FBI figured out that she did it. Why doesn't the film show the Lockwoods' first Christmas without their daughter? I'm sure it was horrible - they must have missed her terribly... The film does not quote Berit Costas' words she said in court, so I will quote them: ""My heart is empty. I ache. I'm half a person."" Kirsten's parents were shattered with grief and they probably still are...

But the most moving comment I found was made by the Costas' neighbour's son who saw Kirsten die: ""I was there that night. I saw Kirsten's blood squirting all over my father as she struggled to breathe. She knew she was dying and the horror on her face as she bled out before us was something none of us will ever forget.""

Rest in peace, Kirsten. I'm on your side.",1297555200,31,7697,4.538961038961039

Kellie playing an insane, jealous, spoiled girl, and Tori playing an innocent & sweet victim. And cheerleaders! That's not the best part, because this would have been good no matter what the story revolved around- the versatile Kellie Martin makes any character her own, & does it believeably. That's not to say I didn't laugh at this movie, but that's just how I am. I can't take these TV-movie dramas seriously cause I'm concentrating on what I can find funny!

What is so sad here is that Kellie Martin's character is the one with the talent and drive. If she had not been pushed over the edge by the taunting of others and her childlike need for approval, life would have ultimately proven her to be the success.

Kellie Martin's performance is so on-target that at times it is agonizing (and embarrassing) to watch. The subtle changes of emotion on her face during the principal's ""be the best"" speech should have won her awards.

I don't think she's good at the dramatic bitch character. Regardless, if you can overlook the iffy acting on her part, the movie is very good. So many girls are teased mercilessly in high school, and just want to belong. Angela, the self-tortured student played by Kellie Martin (who does a much better job acting) decides that she will go to any lengths to be included in the popular crowd, resorting to murder. Despite this being a true story and probably a rare occurrence, the message is clear: kids need to be nicer to each other and just let people be who they are.

1733636,4,B000069JFY,"I remember reading Randall Sullivan's 1985 article which served as the basis for this 1994 TV drama.
  Interestingly, I was close to quite a few people who were threatened with knives during my pre-and early teen years, and the year before the real-life murder depicted in this story took place, survived a near-stabbing at the hands of two girls in my unsupervised science class, who thought it was a lark to play with the rusty knife the science teacher used to cut minerals, and aim it at the necks of unsuspecting classmates. While my would-be assailants were apprehended quickly, and did not return to that school after that year, this is a story about a teenage girl who was able to hide from authorities for six months after committing a fatal stabbing.
 Based on the 1984 murder of a beautiful, dark-haired, olive-skinned cheerleader named Kirsten Costas by a less-affluent blonde classmate named Bernadette Protti, the film stars Kellie Martin as Angela Del Vecchio, the youngest daughter of a pious, lower-middle-class family as its ""Bernadette"".
 A kind, sweet-tempered, introspective girl, who recently transfered from a Catholic school, Angela suffers from low self-esteem. Spurred by the school Principal's (Terry O'Quinn's) speech on ""being the best"", given an assembly at the beginning of the year, Angela sets her sights on joining the elite social service group, the Meadowlarks (or just Larks), becoming the school yearbook editor, becoming a cheerleader, and getting the Queen Bee student who embodies all that she desires to be to incorporate her into her social circle.
 Tori Spelling plays Stacy Lockwood, the Golden Girl, who unwittingly and unfortunately becomes the object of Angela's admiration and envy.
 In reality, the victim and perpetrator had very little contact with each other, which is one major innaccuracy of the film, although Stacy did slight her killer-to-be about her skiing attire.
 The incident where Stacy illicitly reads another girl's diary was also portrayed inaccurately. It was mentioned by an acquaintance of the victim in Sullivan's article. But presumably, that incident and many others in the film were staged that way to give insight, if not into the victim's  character, than definitely insight into the way she was perceived by the girl who would eventually take her life.
  Valerie Harper was great as Angela's kind, religious mother, who is supportive of her daughter, but perhaps not fully aware of how devastating the failure to reach certain goals, and the rejection of certain peer group members will really be for her.
 Marley Shelton plays Jamie, a friend of Angela's who joins in Stacy's mocking of the punk rocker girl (Kathryn Morris)--later a prime suspect in Stacy's slaying--only because she was afraid of Stacy. Margaret Langrick is Angela's other best friend, Jill.
 The film exaggerates the trendiness of the elite girls to a fault, depicting them wearing obscenely long strands of pearls, but does not exaggerate their clannishness and exclusivity.
 We see how Stacy makes more of an impression on the School Principal than Angela when both of the young office workers tell him they are going to try out for cheerleading, and we see how Stacy gets away with flouting certain school rules.
 Words of wisdom from her priest(Eugene Roche) and her sister Theresa(Christa Miller)  do little to console her as she fails to reach most of her goals.
 Angela does become a Lark, and a candystriper. I have observed how teens who work as candystripers are often resentful towards peer group members who don't have that responsibility, perceiving them as people who don't take life seriously enough whether it's true or not.
 Within a few year's time and with a little more maturity and hindsight, the real killer may have come to realize that the object of her fixation had no real obligation to pay her any attention or to justify her life to her if she didn't want to, and  she may ultimately have come to realize that a relationship with her wasn't really all that important.
 Among the things teens should be made to realize is that in most cases, their peer group members are no more responsible for the success of failure of their families' financial situation than anyone else their age, and to try to make that less of an issue. But Santa Mira (in real life, Orinda, California) is a competitive and goal-oriented community, where it is easy for anyone that age to lose sight of that fact.
  Shortly after the end of that school year, when Stacy wins a place on the cheerleading squad and Angela doesn't, and Angela's desperation for acceptance by the ""In Crowd"" reaches an all-time high, she places a call to Stacy's mother, identifying herself only as a member of the Larks, and inviting her to a dinner on behalf of the Larks when no such event is to take place, in order to have time alone with Stacy to try to befriend her. Angela illegally takes the family car out and picks up a reluctant Stacy from her family home.
 True to Bernadette Protti's actual testimony, Stacy is enraged when she learns there is no dinner for the Larks, and refuses to go to a party with Angela. They drive into a church parking lot where Stacy begins to smoke pot, and Stacy denounces Angela when she refuses to do the same.
 Stacy hurries over to a nearby residence to ask a couple for a ride home, explaining the precarious situation with her friend in the shadows.
 Angela tails the car as Stacy is driven home by someone else, and her mind process--in which she fears what Stacy will tell everyone the following day--is revealed to the audience.
 In hindsight, one would say it is better to be slighted for being weird for a brief time than to have the world call you a murderer for the rest of your life. Angela fatally stabs Stacy as she stands at the front door of a residence, and the heartbreak of the community is deeply felt.
 For nearly six months, the wrong girl is accused, although in reality there were two girls accused, and one did not return to that school the following year.
 But using descriptions from witnesses, and psychological profiling, FBI agents, led by James Avery, find the killer, and the community is forced to come to terms with some painful truths about itself in Bernadette's church, and in the trial that follows.
  The class with which the victim and perpetrator would have graduated just celebrated its 20th year reunion. Surely those marred by this tragedy have a different perspective on it now that many are undoubtably parents themselves, and while the victim could have been a nicer person, she might have at least had a chance to live and outgrow that phase of her life.
  The killer was released from prison on June 10, 1992 despite the  objections of the victim's parents (who left California), and can never return to Orinda as a condition of her release.
  About the only positive aspect of all this is that the real-life social service group to which both girls belonged became more inclusive, and at too great a cost, many of the young who were affected by this tragedy began to redefine their values.",1163980800,15,7111,4.854425144747726

Jeannette planned the murder over several days, lied to the police during interviews and even passed a lie detector (like the sociopath she is).  She only admitted to stabbing Kirsten numerous times in the stomach and back six months later when the police were closing in on her.

I don't remember anyone being so envious they would kill over it, but I do understand it was an emotional time for young girls. Fitting in, being popular was what everyone wanted. Only a small group were able to enjoy that. The rest of us, not so much. In this story, the young girl took things too far, took it too hard, and ended up taking a life. The movie is well done, the cast did a good job. The fact it is based on true events makes it an even more tragic story to watch. It is clearly a view more from the perspective of the girl who did the killing, rather than the one who was killed, but maybe that is important too. Trying to make some sense of why she did this. At the end of the day, I can sympathize with what she felt. She was a confused young girl. But more sympathy is directed at the one who had to lose her life. She didn't deserve it. Both of them were only teenagers, and given a little more time both would have matured beyond caring so much about high school social status.",1520553600,,1142,4.08
7965712,3,B000069JFY,"It's entertaining, but it does a disservice to the real-life victim and her family. The film is 100% from the perspective of the killer, not the victim. We don't have the victims account because she died. The movie serves up a double heap of victim blaming and bashing. By the time she's killed, it leaves you thinking she deserved it and you feel sorry for the killer. I can't imagine how this film made the victim's parents feel! In real life, the victim wasn't mean and nasty, but this version of reality makes sense when coming from the mind of a sociopath. There was little interaction between these girls in real life. The killer admired the victim, she seemed perfect, she was competition and possibly a crush. I would rather they had explored that aspect of it instead of this twisted version.
The film shows a tiny kitchen knife when in reality it was 18 inches long and there was never any party to go to, it was a setup. There is no doubt in my mind (when looking at the facts) that this was first-degree murder. The killer is cold and calculating and has dupped even the filmmakers into portraying her as the victim. It's still fascinating to watch, just keep in mind who's imagination this is coming from. BTW the real victim was a brunette and the killer was blond. Interesting that they chose to reverse it.

This is a basic cable movie that still gives you a great message to this day: the socio-economic chasms that make a bully like Stacy behave with entitlement and superiority, mocking her classmates freely with her equally entitled friends, and still be lauded by all the adults around her. Stacys parents never had any idea what their kid was like? This can only mean she hid her hideous personality really well from adults; thats one of the definitions of a sociopath. Of course, nobody deserves to get stabbed to death for being a mean self centered jerk who puts people in therapy for years. But in the indulgent society we live in, and now worse with internet bullsh*t, when you see this it makes you think, I better be sure my kid is never like a Stacy Lockwood.",1519689600,,876,4.550632911392405

Kellie plays Angela (based on Bernadette Protti).  An unassuming, plain, low-esteem, idealistic catholic fifteen year old who wants to strive for the best out of life (usually with a cost). Tori plays Stacy Lockwood (based on Kristen Costas). A popular, stereotypical cheerleader. The movie plays like another movie Heathers or any John Hughes movie. It has followers of Stacy, the dense football player jock boyfriend, and an outcast named Monica who Stacy takes delight in tormenting and taunting. Angela takes to heart in wanting to be the best so she lures Stacy to a fake dinner for their club and ultimately stabs her. The movie seems to sympathize with the killer and her plight of wanting popularity at any cost even at another human's life.
