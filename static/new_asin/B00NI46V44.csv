8678388,4,B00NI46V44,"This movie (despite it all being in Japanese) was pretty cool. I like the design of the Oni, and the characters were pretty cool too. However, I found the movie to be a tad boring in some parts, and it needs more appearances of the Ao Oni. Also, the plot twist and the end just doesn't work. Still a fun movie, based on an amazing game.",1436832000,,336,4.106060606060606
8678389,5,B00NI46V44,"anyone who's ever played Ao Oni before should definitely snag this movie, cause from what ive heard, its twice as great as the indie horror game itself, hmhmhmhm*reveals himself to be an ao oni & bares his fangs before charging*",1435622400,,228,4.725
