2677199,5,B000JLTRFE,"If anybody from Warner Home Video is reading this, have you thought about the implications of releasing a 13-season DVD series at the rate of two seasons per year? This puts Season 13 being released in August of 2010! All of us Dallas fans would like to get the whole collection while the world is still using the current DVD format! Who's to say what the fast-moving rate of technology will have moved us all on to by then. If you're a fan and feel the same way, I ask you second the sentiment and lend your vote by finding this review helpful.",1165968000,168,545,4.300970873786408

2677201,5,B000JLTRFE,"For a trendsetting show that ran 14 seasons, Season 6 is one of DALLAS' two or three best years out of its entire run.

Focusing on the opening of patriarch Jock Ewings' will and the resulting competition between the brothers, J.R. and Bobby, to control the family company, Season 6 (which many fans identify as Season 5) wastes almost not one line of dialogue all year on anything that isn't totally plot driven.

In a way (Who Shot JR? from 2 years earlier notwithstanding), Season 6 is almost the epi-center of the entire series, all the series' basic conflicts boiled down into one taut and amazingly focused year.",1162339200,2,618,4.712962962962963
2677202,5,B000JLTRFE,"I am excited to have another great season on the way, and I agree that they should speed up release because I love the later years and I want to see them now.  Anyway, 5 is a great year, some say the best, with the year long battle for Ewing Oil, JR and Sue Ellen remarrying and then hitting the rocks again, Bobby and Pam splitting, Ellie romancing Clayton and much more, it is definitely a strong contender for most important year of the series.  Starring all the same cast returning from the last year including Barbara Bel Geddes, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Susan Howard, Steve Kanaly, Ken Kercheval, Victoria Principal, and Charlene Tilton, as well as Also Starring Audrey Landers, Jared Martin, Priscilla Pointer, John Beck, and Howard Keel as Clayton Farlow, it's a very entertaining season that really holds up well even today.",1162080000,26,849,4.7687074829931975

2677224,5,B000JLTRFE,"Dallas is probably one of the all time greats.  Even with the passing, I think, of one of it's all time greats, Jim Davis (Jock) it went on with the all time great, good guy/bad guy, Larry Hagman.
The good guy Bobby and Pam leaving the program, it still went on for many sessions.
I'll continue to look at it time and time again",1486166400,,328,4.125

2677226,5,B000JLTRFE,"All Dallas Seasons 1-12 are worth watching. 13 and 14 though are pretty tough to watch. The Movie DVD set is also worth having for the prequel and JR Returns. War of the Ewings though is rough.

Season 6 for me is most notable for the underrated John Beck as Mark Graison debut. I always liked his character, and I hate to say it, I feel he and Pam had better chemistry than Bobby and Pam. I also felt  Priscilla Presley's Jenna Wade had better chemistry with Bobby ""Go Figure"".

I have watched these seasons 1-12 at least 20 times, not including when they ran it on the Soap Channel, I did not watch during the original run, but I do remember Who Shot JR vividly, the incredible media hype, I was only 8 years old so did not pay attention to the show when Mom was watching. Typically I just watch these sets beginning to end. I do own 13 and 14, but I usually bail out early into season 13... No way to sugar coat it, terrible TV, they just ran out of ideas. With Pam and Sue Ellen both Gone, the new blood was frankly boring.

I did like Sheri J. Wilson as April Stevens, once they Kill her off, other than JR and Bobby it's pretty sad.

I even watched every episode of the TNT series. While not perfect, it was exactly what I hoped for, though they could have focused more on original cast once it was clear new audience wasn't being created.

Just get everything if your a die hard Dallas fan, you'll get addicted to the show all over again.",1483401600,,1445,4.1985559566787005

2677292,4,B000JLTRFE,"I received my order quickly than expected and in good condition except 2 episodes did not play well at first.

 This season was heart breaking because of Pam and Bobby splitting up and the toll the fight for Ewing oil takes on their marriage and Miss Ellie. Also did not like the way Pam was so easily taken with Mark Graison (hated this character) so quickly it is like she did not value her marriage or really love Bobby when she almost sleeps with Mark and continues to go out with him. It seems to me that Bobby was more faithful in and to his marriage than Pam was. Bobby stayed true to Pam when Holly try to seduce him and he never strayed in their marriage except for that 1 time he almost did in Season 3 with Jenna Wade. It seemed like Pam was ready to give up on her marriage so quickly(did not like her this season at all) Also poor Sue Ellen  who was fooled and betrayed again by JR and driven back to the bottle and the tragedy of what happen to Mickey Trotter and the death of Rebecca Wentworth. This season so sad. We get to see again Katherine who reappears due her mother's death and her plot which she begins with JR to destroy Cliff and Pam and Bobby marriage. Katherine is not so sweet after all but a devious and calculating witch!!!!!!!!!!",1424044800,2,1261,4.245833333333334

2677306,4,B000JLTRFE,"This really isn't THE best season, like i have seen some say. Its better than Season 5, for sure. But in my opinion, season 5, 6, and 7 were somewhat boring, not totally boring, but they sometimes dragged. I think Seasons 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are some of the most exciting aside from the first 4 seasons. They 8-12 seasons were more soap opera-ish, which i think made them seem a bit faster and exciting. seasons 5-7 had barely any new main characters and just a lot of back and forth oil deals, Season 6 has a big storyline built around Jocks Will, of course J.R has to try and get a look at it before everyone else. These middle season(5-7) start of either slow or ok, Then drag along through the season and then get good the last 6 or 7 episodes.  This season still has a lot of key moments for fans of the show, or for people who want to watch this series. I think the Lucy abortion storyline was lame, it think they should have written it as, she gets another test and it turns out its Mitch's(her soon ex husband) Baby, and she decides to keep it, at least Her character would have an interesting storyline, and a baby. Some somewhat interesting things happen in this season, its nowhere near as exciting and suspenseful as season 9, the dream season.",1420588800,,1256,4.29957805907173

2677365,1,B000JLTRFE,"Don't buy this DVD. Five episodes (10, 11 and 12) are not on one side of a disk. Instead, there are two DVDs with the same episodes copied. So we had to purchase those three episodes separately from Amazon. Then, when we began watching Season 7, we were confused by the first episode. That's because the last two episodes from Season 6 were not only not included in this set, but aren't even listed on the table of contents in the season. So you are paying for a season that isn't a complete season. It hasn't happened in previous Dallas seasons distributed by Warner Bros. and I hope it doesn't happen again. Very disapppointing.",1399766400,,630,4.535087719298246
2677366,5,B000JLTRFE,"But when you come to DALLAS, you don't really come for the sunshine, do you? Of course not. You come for the powling (business and otherwise), betrayal, heartbreak and deliciously devious deals that J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) concocts. The rock that has been Pam (Victoria Principal) & Bobby (Patrick Duffy) may not be so indestructible after all. What can drive someone to the bottle? Can two distant cousins find love?

That is just a taste of what awaits the inquisitive visitor when they deign to come to Southfork. The writing is as sharp as ever, and the storylines are juicier, deadlier and more cutthroat than ever. Special mention goes to Barbara Bel Geddes and Victoria Principal for their superb acting skills.

2677372,4,B000JLTRFE,"Like I have said in previous reviews, I started watching Dallas in kindergarten (which was inappropriate).  At that time, I liked SueEllen and JR.  As an adult, I only like Lucy and and some of the younger cast, oh the irony.  Anyway, the writers seem to have a hard time coming up with storylines for Lucy which I find odd since she is YOUNG, beautiful and smart.  The show made women seem stupid and useless on the show.  Yes, Donna, was smart and intelligent on the show but she was BORING.

This season, JR and Bobby are fighting over Ewing Oil.  Even with 2-sided DVDs (that will not play in my laptop), there are like 6 discs for your viewing pleasure.  The business discussions are long and tedious and oftentimes complicated.  It is really not entertaining at all.  After SueEllen and JR get back together, SueEllen basically just sits around all dressed up and pretty.  Lucy is dating Ray's nephew after a kidnapping, rape, and abortion.

Ms. Ellie is a pivotal character; she and Pam and Marilee Stone seem to be the only smart women on the show.

As as adult, I didn't realize how old the characters were on the show.  Clayton, however, was viewed as too old for SueEllen.  I personally think SueEllen should have been matched with another guy.  As  an adult, I don't see JR and SueEllen as a good couple.

Bobby is the best male character this season; getting down in the dirt with JR while still looking hot doing it.",1386288000,,1430,4.51953125

2677458,4,B000JLTRFE,"**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**

In Season Six of ""Dallas"", the family gathers for the reading of Jock's will and the terms pit Bobby and J.R. against one another in competition for Ewing Oil as the brother who turns the biggest profit in 12 months wins controlling interest. This is the main plot line running throughout these 28 episodes that originally aired during the 1982-83 TV season, when ""Dallas"" dipped to #2 in the ratings after two years at the top.

The competition between the Ewing boys tears the family apart to the point that Miss Ellie goes as far as having Jock declared mentally incompetent to dispute the terms of the will. Pam moves out of Southfork and into a hotel with baby Christopher, and soon takes up with hunky and attentive Mark Grayson (John Beck). Conversely, Sue Ellen and J.R. become closer than ever and remarry. J.R. signs on as consultant for competitor Harwood Oil, at the request of inexperienced but devious and leggy heiress Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles). Holly soon regrets doing business with the snaky J.R. and tries to cause trouble by seducing him then reporting their ""affair"" to Sue Ellen. The escalating war for Ewing Oil also prompts J.R. to resort to illegal dealings with Cuba.

Donna heads up a new Texas Energy Commission, which puts her at odds with J.R. Meanwhile, Ray brings his irresponsible cousin Mickey to stay with them, in hopes the kid will shape up. Mickey eventually begins dating Lucy, who having been impregnated by her shutterbug stalker last season, undergoes an abortion with only Pam being in on the secret. Tragedy strikes near the end of the season and Mickey ends up in a coma after a car crash in which a drunken Sue Ellen was behind the wheel.

Miss Ellie gradually begins socializing as a widow and as the season progesses, she grows particularly close to Clayton Farlow (Howard Keel), to the consternation of J.R.

After Cliff's suicide attempt in last season's finale, mother Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer) declares all-out war on the Ewings, causing friction between her and Pam. Rebecca uses her considerable wealth to buy an oil company and appoint son Cliff president. Unfortunately, a series of events leads to Rebecca's death after a plane crash mid-season. Afton (Audrey Landers) plays the ""good girl"" this season, faithfully standing by Cliff after his suicide attempt and Rebecca's death. Half-sister Katherine (Morgan Brittany) butts heads with Cliff over her father's company, and secretly tries to widen the rift between Bobby and Pam, so she can have him for herself.

At season's end, Pam asks Bobby for a divorce, Sue Ellen is driven back to the bottle, and Southfork goes up in flames during a fight between J.R. and Ray, with John Ross and a drunk Sue Ellen asleep upstairs.

This season dragged a little, as the contest plotline between J.R. and Bobby was not that exciting. Things pick up mid-season around the time of the plane crash and get better from there.

The offices at Ewing Oil get a makeover and Bobby's secretary Phyllis (Deborah Tranelli) gets more screen time. While Sue Ellen's trendy mullet 'do didn't appeal to me, Pam looks absolutely ravishing this season, her hair slightly lightened to a flattering rusty brown. Patrick Duffy has beefed up some and Bobby's sporting a bulkier physique.

My favorite scene this season occurs when J.R. pimps out Sue Ellen to help seal a business deal and acquire a badly-needed oil refinery. J.R. purposely shows up late so the client can have some ""quality time"" with Sue Ellen. When he arrives with the excuse that ""one of my oil well's caught fire"", Sue Ellen snaps back ""Did the telephones burn TOO?"". Her delivery is sharp, cutting and priceless.

Visually, this is the best season yet as all the scenes look bright and crisp and new. The discs are again dual-sided and come in three plastic snapcases, just like the Season 5 set.

Not the best season, but still engrossing TV from the '80s when prime time soaps ruled the airwaves..",1301875200,,3995,4.860294117647059

Also, the ladies' outfits begin to become a tad bit more Dynasty-esque as well...check out the shoulder pads on Sue Ellen's wedding dress!  Season 6 is great fun!!",1279065600,,549,4.903225806451613
2677479,5,B000JLTRFE,"This is the last really enjoyable seaon of Dallas as far as I am concerned. The battle for Ewing Oil between the two brothers is the main plot throughout, with lots of sub plots involving somewhat minor characters and then the climactic car accident and fire at the ranch house to end things.
A Romeo and Juliet romance between Lucy Ewing and ranch hand Mickey Trotter adds some humor to this season. It also showed a little more depth to Charlene Tilton's acting skills than in her ""poor little rich girl"" persona.
All of the stories are tied together and end in several tragedies including drunk driving, blackmail and revenge attempts.
Better that the next season for sure.

The special features this time incudes a documentary about the infuence of Dallas on pop culture asserting that people as well as other tv shows imitated Dallas and that the show was a reflection of the 80's ""me generation"" of greed. The Ultimate Dallas website is mentioned, the ranchhouse as well as yet another abbreviated recycling of ""Who Shot JR?"" media crapola.  No comment obviously.",1269475200,,1069,4.836065573770492
2677480,5,B000JLTRFE,"I had watched this season years ago and now I am recently viewing it again. I have to say that I am amazed by the whole season. Every plot twist seems to work to perfection. The JR-Bobby fight for control of Ewing Oil takes center stage. JR, of course, is willing to do anything to win the company, including selling to an embargoed country, obtaining a controversial variance and creating dummy corporations. Bobby also shows somewhat of a dark side in the fight for Ewing Oil. He is willing to sacrifice his marriage and good-standing relationships to gain control of Ewing Oil. Even the subplots with Cliff and Lucy, who have both had their share of clunkers, work well. The mark of a great show is that when the closing credits appear, you cannot wait to see the next episode. With season 6, I don't think that there was one episode that did not leave me wanting more. Unfortunately, this is one of the last good overall seasons as the show really goes downhill after season 7. The later seasons have some good moments, but they are, for the most part, uneven.",1268524800,,1064,4.546875

2677482,5,B000JLTRFE,"I think the 6th season is the best one yet. There were devious dealings and lots of intriguing schemes by both JR and Bobby. Bobby seems to be evolving into a more JR-like character, coming up with some pretty dirty dealing himself.

2677485,5,B000JLTRFE,"Season Six of ""Dallas"" is a show at its peak.  Season Five faltered somewhat as the show tried to find its bearings after the death of Jim Davis (Jock) and a sober Sue Ellen was removed from most the main drama, speanding far too much time sitting around at a distant ranch.  But with Season Six, everything hits the fan;  I don't think I've had so much fun with the show as I did here.

So much happens in this season that it's impossible to encapsulate but there are many interesting stories that develop over the course of the episodes.  This season is mainly known as the one when JR and Bobby fougth for control of the Ewing empire in the wake of Jock's death.  This entails all kinds of scheming; for JR, that's natural, but Bobby starts to lose his own soul in his pursuit of power.  Characters whom I didn't think much of at first - Lois Chiles' Holly Harlow is a bit of a dud at first - become more important by the finale.

And then there are the final four episodes in which every storyline brilliantly comes together.  I am glad I didn't read many recaps beforehand because it would have given away what happens.  But wow - when things happen they happen BIG.  Plus, we get the added bonus of Sue Ellen going back to the bottle with the usual disastrous results.

This is definitely one season to watch again.  Bravo.",1229472000,3,1329,4.353658536585366
2677486,5,B000JLTRFE,"""Dallas"", in my opinion is the best television show of all time, and this season illustrates why it is so. The stories revolve around universal and timeless themes such as the love-hate relationships among family members; the internal and external battle over the use of power for good or evil; the struggle to restore trust to tattered relationships; coming to terms with the death of a loved-one; and the hurt, fear and healing subsequent to sexual abuse. ""Dallas"" was never better than it was this season, aside from season 10 (which I hope will soon be released) this was the last truly great season.  There has never been, and there never will be a show as thoroughly entertaining as ""Dallas"". Much of the success of this season can be attributed to the performances of the cast. Was there ever any other performer who possessed a character the way Larry Hagman did J.R.?  Was there ever a character you loved to hate as much as you did J.R. (and at times still found yourself rooting for him)? How Larry Hagman never won an Emmy is simply beyond comprehension. Linda Gray as Sue Ellen Ewing was nothing short of brilliant, and Barbara Bel Geddes (the only cast member to win an Emmy for her work on the show) repeatedly gave reserved, but incredibly powerful performances. Great stories and exceptional performances make ""Dallas"" as entertaining today as it was twenty-five years ago.",1215216000,9,1390,4.811715481171548
2677487,5,B000JLTRFE,The on-going tales of the guy (JR) you love to hate.  It's fun reliving the Dallas series.  The plots and counterplots are just as true today as they were 20-30 years ago.,1202428800,2,171,4.3125
2677488,4,B000JLTRFE,"The series it's great. The presentation and quality of this set are disappointing. And it's getting worst, this season only have portuguese subtitles. Anyhow DALLAS it's a must.",1198454400,,177,5.357142857142857
2677499,3,B000JLTRFE,"It's been great watching Dallas again after all these years, but just like back in the 70s/80s, the quality of the writing took a nosedive after Jim Davis' death altered the existing dynamic of the series.

With Jock Ewing gone and Bobby and J.R. fighting for control of Ewing Oil most scenes are as boring as sitting in an actual board meeting (read that as BORED meeting), though, of course, the business in the series is incredibly dumbed down for non-business viewers from anything that goes on in real life.

Even worse, Audrey Landers never could sing, and apparently it was in her contract that she could sing every few episodes she appeared in.  More dead air.

I believe in later seasons Dallas gets back on track somewhat, but never again will it match the quality of seasons 1-5.

The sets are also INCREDIBLY cheap looking (and were even back then), and the women's costumes and hairstyles haven't held up as well as they have on rival series Dynasty and Falcon Crest.  (The Mercedes and Porsche cars used on the series, however, are just as nice looking today as they were then, and better looking than a lot of the ""aerodynamic"" design cars manufactured today.)

Overall this is a season only the Dallas completist need bother with.  It's a chore to watch much of the time rather than a pleasure, and breaking up Bobby and Pam was a huge mistake that went on for years to follow.  It's also hard to watch Susan Howard as Donna Krebs knowing today she's affiliated with the NRA and the Republican party.  Lois Chiles as Holly Harwood, on the other hand, is a real treat -- especially in the scene where she pulls the gun on J.R. in bed.",1196553600,4,1649,4.559322033898305

2677501,5,B000JLTRFE,"One of the best seasons of Dallas. We get to see Pam and Cliff's mother die, the return of Katherine, the return of Sue Ellen the alcoholic and the season finale when South Fork burns. One of the most underestimated actresses is Audrey Landers. She does an excellent job playing Aston and proves to be a fine actress. Of course, what would Dallas be without J.R. doing his underhanded tricks. He is caught in the sack with his business partner Holly by Sue Ellen, which drives her back to the bottle and eventually into a horrible car accident. A sad note is the deteoriation of Bobby and Pam's marriage. A good note is the romance of Miss Ellie and Clayton Farlow. Highlights: Sue Ellen finding out that Dusty is not impotent and has remarried, Sue Ellen trying to go to bed with Clayton and Ray and Donna's relationship with Ray's family.

2677502,5,B000JLTRFE,"Dallas season 6(really season 5) is unbelievable.like some other seasons, the storylines and arcs in this season come fast and strong. I even liked this season more than season 3, which everyone seems to favor the most. But i think this is my favorite with the season before it maybe in 2nd place. The end of the previous season, everyone finds out Cliff Barnes attempted suicide partly because of being cheated by J.R.Miss Ellie tells him something to the effect of"" You are a cold and unfeeling man,J.R, and as soon as BObby gets back( from California with pam, investigating christophers birth),I will dismantle you as president of Ewing OIL"", and in this season opener, she does just that...Little does she know J.R, soon runs another oil business,Harwood Oil, via a pretty little thing named Holly Harwood, who at once becomes Jr's reluctant ally,and then rival. Holly plans her revenge,and has much to do with changing his and SueEllens life in a way that has reprecussions for the rest of the series. The previous seasons, you got glimpses that Pam and Bobbys marraige was headed for trouble. When Jocks will is read and announces the fight for Ewing oil, their marraige cannot survive the intense change in Bobby and the toll it takes. In some episodes Bobby is irritable and downright nasty!(around the time he and ray are following Walt Driscoll), and this is the first season Bobby resorts to J.R like tactics like blackmail, to get his way in the business world..also worth mentioning is the more prominent reintroduction ( she was introduced in a previous season as were many other characters)of Cliff and pams devious half sister Katherine Wentworth, and Prescilla Pointer as their mother, Rebecca respectively. Miss Ellie gets closer with Clayton....boring, and Cliff is an amazing actor,,,he really owns the scenes he is in and ended up as one of my favorite characters as the series progressed although i feel he was unlikeable in the early seasons.lastly, The Lucy/Mickey storyline just kills me. The writing and chemisty between is so soft, and feels so special, you almost forget you are watching two characters in a tv show...I don't want to give anything away, but they make him out to be the love of Lucys life, certainly much more of a connection than she ever had with Mitch. Their story arc culminates in a very important plot point ...Charlene Hilton(lucY) is another one that won me over this season, from the abortion storyline at the beginning of the season( she was really pregnant by the time they started shooting the season, which explains all the funny/clever ways they had her sitting down or standing behind something for the first few episodes), to the Mickey storyline, you could really see what a good actress she was, and her costar was very talented too. All the episodes are excellent, none are boring,like all dallas seasons, the last 4 or 5 episodes are especially juicy, and the season finale office confrontation between J.R and Pam is classic, I promise you will want to watch this season over and over.",1183420800,10,3051,4.880539499036609

2677531,5,B000JLTRFE,"Here comes another season of J.R.'s (Larry Hagman) double-dealing ways as he attempts, this time, to wrench control of Ewing Oil from his brother and his mother. The body count rises, literally and figuratively, as the dastardly anti-hero works his machinations for his ultimate ends.

New characters are introduced that play important parts in the developing story line while other characters find themselves more embroiled in the ongoing saga of the Ewing clan.

As far as the new are concerned, prominent among those are Holly Harwood (Lois Chiles) as a reluctant ally to J.R. She finds herself initially fascinated by the oil man but soon sees the real J.R. and eventually must decide where her allegiance lies.

Mark Grayson (John Beck) becomes the ""third wheel"" in a love triangle that causes a rift in the seemingly unbreakable marriage of Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pam (Victoria Principal).

Ray's cousin, Mickey (Timothy Patrick Murphy) becomes the love interest of Lucy but, unfortunately, meets tragedy at the hands of one of the victims of J.R.'s dirty deals.

As far as the ""old,"" Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) continues her ""abused wife"" ways as she remarries J.R., knowing full well his track rate for ""faithfulness.""

Ray (Steve Kanaly) and wife Donna (Susan Howard) have their own problems as she tries to balance marriage with an ever-rising political career.

Afton (Audrey Landers) must contend with her love for Cliff (Ken Kercheval) and his obsession with bringing down the Ewings and his love for Sue Ellen.

Lucy (Charlene Tilton) goes through divorce bangs and her burgeoning attraction to Mickey.

Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes) contends with her feelings for her late husband and her determination to bring an end to the family squabbles. In addition to those, she starts to find herself attracted to another man.

Besides the regulars, recurring characters get their moment to shine in this outstanding season as well. Punk Anderson (Morgan Woodard) stands out as a worthy successor to ""Jock"" as the one man that can really keep the Ewing boys in line. Besides that, he's one heckuva sharp dresser in his western-styled attire.

Pam's mom, Rebecca (Priscilla Pointer), makes her presence known as she works hard to support both her daughter and son.

Harv Smithfield (George O. Petrie) as the family lawyer must volley both sides of the fence as he must deal with his loyalty to the late Jock's wishes and his friendship with Miss Ellie.

Watching the episodes back to back, one can see how the producers spent a bundle on clothing and locations. Also, the sets were more lavish than in previous seasons, with upgrades at both the Ewing home and the offices.

Acting-wise, no one can top Hagman as the devilish J.R. His lack of an Emmy win is an unexplainable travesty in the history of television.",1174003200,7,2820,4.985074626865671

2677535,5,B000JLTRFE,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this was a very exciting season for Dallas.  It sets up quite a few connections and characters that are important in future seasons.  I can't wait to get Season 7.  Only wish that they were released faster than 2 a year.  There are 14 seasons, that means 7 years to get a complete set.

Although the English subtitles were convenient, I achieved similar result by turning on closed caption on my TV.  (I use the subtitles/cc when I'm watching at night and have the volumn turned down.)  My TV has a selection for English or Spanish.  Just a guess but maybe due to the technology of cc being available in the TV show and embedded in the video is why there is no English or Spanish subtitles on the video.  They should have said something obvious on the box to let people know.",1173312000,,808,4.405405405405405
2677536,5,B000JLTRFE,Dallas just keeps better and better.  I love how this show keeps inventing storylines that keep things interesting. The sets and the fashions keep getting nicer and richer looking- epitomizing the '80s! I can't wait to collect the rest of the series.  I grew up with this show and watching it now takes me back to when I was a kid watching it on Friday nights.  I highly recommend this DVD series!,1172707200,2,397,4.486111111111111
2677537,4,B000JLTRFE,"From memory this was the last great series of ""Dallas"" Season 7 started to slip down hill and get repetitious, Barbara Bel Geddes did a lot less and the storylines became more irrational. So fans should enjoy this series, which really was the top of the mountain . I do feel, however, that it is dfisappointing that after the first two box sets there have been no interviews with the actors  or (better still) commentaries. The early commentaries were a hoot, where have they gone? Or did the actors feel there was nothing else to say? I would love to hear what Steve Kanaly or Charlene Tilton had to say about Timothy Patrick Murphy, the highly promising young actor who played Mickey in this series, but tragically had his life and career cut short only five years later by dying of AIDS.",1172448000,4,790,4.563380281690141

2677549,1,B000JLTRFE,I can't understand why? launching five seasons with Spanish subtitles and suddenly release the sixth season with Portuguese subtitles only?? Completely unfair for loyal customers and fans!!!,1172102400,,190,6.074074074074074
2677550,1,B000JLTRFE,What is the rationale behind launching five seasons with Spanish subtitles and suddenly release the sixth season with Portuguese subtitles only?? Completely unfair for loyal customers and fans!!!,1172016000,4,195,6.0
2677551,5,B000JLTRFE,"To me this is the most memorable season in the Dallas saga. The fight for Ewing oil between Bobby and JR saw lots of schemings and machinations in order to gain control of the company. And don't forget how Sue Ellen made that terrible error of judgement in remarrying good old JR. The character that I loved most who made her appearance in season 6 was Holly Harwood, played by Lois Chiles. Again she made the miscalculation of getting involved in business with JR but the way she got him out of her life was so devious that old JR himself must be surprised! To me this is the Dallas I remember...the good old days when I was a 15 yr old in school. Simply the best season!",1171411200,2,672,4.2578125
2677552,1,B000JLTRFE,"Why, why, why there are not english subs?

Only Portugues!

My God, I spent my dollars for nothing.....",1171152000,2,103,4.666666666666667
2677553,5,B000JLTRFE,"This season has all the slime from the previous 5 seasons and then some! Cliff Barnes pulls thru his suicide attempt and regains oil bigshot status, J.R. gets held captive by the Cubans, Southfork is set ablaze, Sue Ellen starts drinking again, a major character gets killed off, Lucy beds down Ray Krebbs' cousin, Pam leaves Bobby and wants a divorce, some moustachioed dork keeps hitting on Pam, Miss Ellie and Clayton Farlow are on the brink of playing footsie, Sue Ellen attempts to seduce Clayton, Bobby & Pam's son Christopher seems to cry in every scene he's in, J.R & Sue Ellen remarry and lots of shady deals and sex as Bobby and J.R. duke it out to see who wins the presidency of Ewing Oil - thanks to daddy Jock's ridiculous will.

This season is a helluva lotta fun! Keep your eyes on Ken Kercheval as Cliff Barnes...he pulls off some great acting here! Even though Cliff was made out to be the ""loser"" on DALLAS, Kercheval proves what a winner he is in the acting department...very impressive.

There's only one special feature: a featurette a little over eleven minutes long that shows the impact DALLAS had on America (and other parts of the world).

What else do you need to know? Sue Ellen has a brand new hairdo, Pam's sister Katherine puts the moves on Bobby, oil baroness Holly Harwood (pant! pant!) puts the moves on both J.R. and Bobby, the annual Ewing barbecue takes place, Donna looks great in tight pants, John Ross actually has lines to speak, a seedy J.R. associate commits suicide, Afton's hair gets bigger, and Ray Krebbs becomes the show's bigger hero, a position formerly held by Bobby.

These snippets are just a tip of the iceberg of the fun you'll have watching this box set...it's hard to break away from it! If yer a DALLAS fan you know this show is fun...so buy it awready!",1170806400,5,1811,4.580246913580247
2677554,5,B000JLTRFE,"This is by far one of the best written and acted seasons of DALLAS -- superceded only by Season 7 (which I hope will be available soon). The twists, turns and plot surprises are a blast. Series regulars Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy and Victoria Principal prove why they were stars long before celebrities needed multiple plastic surgeries and PR agents to attain fame. And guest stars like Lois Chiles add spice. You can't miss with this season - whether watching for the first or fiftieth time.",1170806400,2,506,4.761363636363637
2677555,4,B000JLTRFE,"Dallas is one of my all time favorite TV shows.

Every time a season is released on DVD I purchase it.

Always nice to rewatch the episodes.

Season 6  a good season, not the best.  You can see EASY J. R. set ups a mile away.

But, as is normal now, the DVD packages do NOT have any cast interviews about the season.  I find this very disappointing.

And, I have mentioned this in my reviews of some of the previous released seasons of the show.  I like to watch extras like that.",1170547200,2,480,4.075268817204301

8152009,3,B000JLTRFE,Classic show but after watching so many seasons of this it got boring watching it again after all these years by today's standards. However from the 80s this show was great.,1517270400,,173,4.612903225806452
