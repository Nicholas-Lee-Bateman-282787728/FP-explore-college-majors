3176,5,0740316591,"This is must have DVD if you love fusion or jazz. The great Steve Gadd is grooving and such a refined musician. He makes the music special by his tatesful playing. The guys in the band are the Best in the business!! Amazing talent within this band consisting of: Michael Landau, Jimmy Johnson, Larry Goldings and Walt Fowler. The performance captured that night was a very special one. You must see this DVD if you love good musicians playing with excellent taste and spontaneity.",1475020800,4,480,4.726190476190476

3181,4,0740316591,"I liked this video. I had it on my ""wish list"" for quite a while and decided to get it. It is a family video and a christian themed video. I thought the actors were superb with Ruby Dee, Julie Harris among others. The story line of a man returning to his grandmother's house after she has suffered a stroke and he has suffered the suicide of his pregnant wife is sad but interesting as the viewer follows the characters to their respective ends. Without giving too much away, there is a sort of redemption for all characters, one way or another. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that the video kind of left the story unfinished (at least in my opinion). You get the feeling that the main character will eventually return for good to his roots but you really do not know that and I felt sort of left at ""loose ends.""
Other than that, I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it. It reminds me a little of the Hallmark Hall of Fame videos.",1307404800,7,961,4.228260869565218
