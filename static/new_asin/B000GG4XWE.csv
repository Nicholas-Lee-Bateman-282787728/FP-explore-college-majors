2609287,1,B000GG4XWE,"First of all...this is NOT the complete collection.  Secondly, the cartoons are butted together with hardly time for one to end before the next one begins.  And lastly, there is no booklet, no listing, no menu of any kind on the DVD itself.

Very shoddy package of some very fine cartoons and characters.  I hate to sound like an old-timer...but why do most people not care anymore about what they produce?  How could you sign you name or be part of a team that worked on this very mediocre (at best) packaging, and walk out of work with any sense of pride?

Dramatic, I know, but fight the urge to be any part of mediocrity.  Be proud to sign your name to anything you produce.  No one should be proud of being any part of this packaging.",1163289600,151,739,4.343065693430657
2609288,4,B000GG4XWE,"Okay, I just got my copy of ""Harveytoons"" the complete collection. These are the cartoons that I grew up with, loved them on Saturday Mornings on the ""New Casper Cartoon Show"" etc. It is great that they have put this out finally. But my question is this...why didn't they have a booklet so you could know what was on each disc? Everyone seems to be upset about this, and I can't blame them! It will take me some time to see if all my favorites are there! There is one bright spot though in all the set...run the 49th selection, and speed through the first Casper cartoon...right after that is an original 1950's-1960's ""Harveytoons"" opening, with the Big Red ""H"" and the fuqua color background with the Harvey Stars on both sides with the Jack-In-The Box! It is the only cartoon that has that opening on all four discs! I love the music from these cartoons and I smile whenever I hear it because it reminds me of more happier days as a child! Winston Sharples (God rest his soul) I still love your cartoon scores! Being a musician myself, many times I wish I were in that studio orchestra! But have fun with the set, and do what I did...I am writing down the name of the cartoons on each disc to refer to on paper so I'll know what to choose! Did anyone who has this set run across the the ""Modern Madcap"" cartoon, ""Miceniks?"" The one with ""Scat"" the cat trying to catch some mice who were beatniks making music in an Expresso Coffee shop? If so, please respond and let me know what disc and number! :) I think I would have liked it better with the orignal ""H-Harveytoons"" opening! The excitment of Herman & Katnip, Little Audrey, and if I remember correctly, there were variations of music with the ""Modern Madcap"" openings! Enjoy! You'll go back to being a child again...and for me, time isn't on my side as I get further away from that age! :)",1163116800,8,1846,4.400584795321637
2609289,1,B000GG4XWE,"Animation Historian and self-proclaimed Famous Studios fan Jerry Beck posted this on his excellent Cartoon Brew web site:

""Sony Wonder has just released a boxed set called Harveytoons: The Complete Collection. 'Harveytoons' was the generic name affixed to the 1950s Paramount/Famous Studio cartoons (featuring Casper, Baby Huey, Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, Buzzy, etc.) when they were originally syndicated to television back in the 1960s, after Harvey Comics acquired the TV and non-theatrical rights to the library. Classic Media owns the collection today and authorized this new set. I haven't had time to review the whole set, but what we have here are 52 episodes of THE HARVEYTOONS SHOW, a program I formatted for Harvey Entertainment and Fox Kids back in 1998. Unfortunately, this set does NOT constitute 'the complete collection' under any condition. For a variety of reasons we did not incorporate the entire Harveytoon library into the original series. Certain cartoons (particularly the Screen Songs) are edited. The fact that their were 78 episodes should tip you off right there. Here's the list of the original Fox Kids series. Sadly the contents of the DVD set doesn't even match up to this list (for example, episode 52 on the DVD is actually #53 of the series).

""Oh, how I wish someone from Classic Media had consulted with me. For one, I would have made sure to include certain cartoons (like the politically incorrect Chew Chew Baby) and it would have been fun to create some bonus materials. The good news is that the cartoons look nice and clean, the cult classic La Petite Parade is included (episode #40 on the DVD) and they've restored the original Jackson Beck vocal tracks to Buzzy The Crow.""",1161907200,267,1726,5.031468531468532
2609290,1,B000GG4XWE,"Right, well, The Bits is saying it will include all 312 cartoons. If they run between 6 and 8 minutes each that's an average of 7 mins per cartoon. 7x312 = 2184 minutes. Slice that by 8 (the number of sides this 4-disc set will have) and you get 273 mins per disc. Halve that to get your dual-layer total and it comes to just over 130 minutes per layer.

Since these were mostly limited animation cartoons, that starts to look a lot more likely. Though they might not have much room to breathe - and any bonus features are sure to be a no show - it is possible that this release will contain all 312 HarveyToons.

Time will tell, which is why I haven't rated this yet (hence just the one star), but considering how cartoons like this have been bundled before, I wouldn't be surprised if this was legitimate.",1161043200,8,807,4.302631578947368

He really enjoys them and laughs out loud at the antics of Casper, Wendy, Little Audrey, Baby Huey and others. If you want to re-visit your own childhood, you'll love this collection of Harveytoons.

I am not pleased with the little cartoon snippets that were used as filler for the show this collection is made of because I like all the toons and want to see the whole thing.

2609407,3,B000GG4XWE,"OK folks, here's the deal. I wrote this review before any of the individual sets came out and from what I've gathered they are the same as this release except separated by the character's cartoons. This set has some good and bad news, but for the price, I suggest you buy it if you want any Harveytoons or want to get the most for your money. The set consist of 4 double sided discs with 7 episodes on each side. Each episode is comprised of 3 cartoons and a 3 minute clip from one of more memorable moments of a Harveytoon.

The clips are a waste of space as well as the generic intros and endings. The time would have been better used for the missing cartoons on this set. The good news is the cartoons look pretty good with accurate color and minimal wear. The price I paid was $10.00(on sale) for 168 cartoons plus 56 clips, but I've seen this at Wal-Mart for $5.00.  That's an excellent deal and it's hard to knock at either of those prices!

The bad news is it's not complete and the cartoons are butted together so the intros of the actual cartoons aren't full length. The songs are bouncing ball songs are no where to be found and the menus are horrible as there are no titles of the cartoons on the menu or written anywhere on the package! I suggest downloading the table of contents for the Harveytoon website like I did. The frustrating thing is that instead of adding generic intros and the 56 three minute clips of cartoons already on the set, they could have fit the missing cartoons to make this set truly complete! At worst add another disc and charge a little more to do it right.

Harveytoons have never been my favorite cartoon franchise, but I was amazed how many of these shorts I remembered. I have always like monsters so a ghostly cartoon was hard for me to resist at a young age. I find these cartoons charming, but better suited for very young children.

2609426,3,B000GG4XWE,"Harvey Toons - The Complete Collection is most definitely a mixed bag.  The cartoons themselves, dating from the 50's and 60's, are a delightful bit of nostalgia and well worth the modest price of this collection.  Largely forgotten today, the Harvey Toons cartoons were largely based on characters from the Harvey Comics line -  Casper the Friendly Ghost, Baby Huey, Little Audrey, Herman and Katnip, Buzzy the Crow - but also included a line of ""Modern Madcaps"" which were not from any comic books but mostly amusing one-shot cartoons of the sort you frequently saw in theaters (back in the 50's and 60's anyway) just before the feature film began.  Together, the Harvey Toons are an interesting collection not only for the cartoons themselves as part of cartoon history but also for the insights they now offer on cultural attitudes of the time. It really was a different world back then.

All of that said, however, the packaging of the collection is frustratingly bad in just about every imagineable way. Nothing in the packaging or on the individual DVDs tells you which cartoons are on which discs. The order of the cartoons is almost random, being neither chronological nor by main characters. The indexing is pretty much useless as it is impossible to find - let alone select - an individual cartoon. The cartoons are compressed together in lumps with the opening Harvey Toons intro at the beginning of a lump and the credits at the end of a lump.  And despite what the title claims, this is not the ""complete"" collection. Quite a few of the original Harvey Toons are in fact missing from this collection.

Note:  It is well worth checking out Gord Wilson's March 11, 2011 review - ""Funday Funnies"" - here on Amazon as provides an invaluable listing of exactly which cartoons are to be found on each side of each disk, not to mention a good history of the Harvey Toons' run on TV. I strongly urge everyone to vote for his review to get it up to the top of the stack where everyone can see it and take advantage of the listings he has provided. They definitely make it easier to find what you're looking for.

Recommended for anyone who remembers the old Harvey Toon cartoons or anyone who wants to see some of the better done cartoons from the period. But only because there is not yet a properly done collection available as an alternative.",1323475200,7,2350,4.670702179176756

However, I think the dvd more than makes up for its shortcomings (which include no original titles, no cartoon names in the menus, and double sided disks) with quantitiy alone. I have never seen another set of thatrical cartoons that contains SO much for so little cash. We're talking over 50 half-hour episodes made up of about 3 cartoons (though admittedly, the clips that ending most episodes are pointless.) And no, the cartoons aren't great either. Kids should love them, but it can't be watched by most people like warner bros. or mgm cartoons. But if you are a fan of classic cartoons (why else would you be reading this?), good animation, great backrounds and music, and some genuinely funny gags will make it good entertainment. I think herman/Katnip and baby Hueys are your best bet, and some of those horribly cute and repetetive caspers should be avoided at all costs.

2609431,4,B000GG4XWE,"""Matty's Funday Funnies"" ran on Sunday (Funday) on ABC from 1959 to 1962. The show was immensely popular, featuring Casper the friendly ghost and other characters from Harvey Famous theatrical cartoons, which were shown by Paramount in theaters in the '50s. Casper was also syndicated in 1953 for TV in seven minute cartoons. ""Matty"" in the title of the 1959 series referred to the sponsor, Mattel Toys, and the cartoon hosts, Matty and Sisterbelle. The show's second incarnation, ""Matty's Funnies"" in 1962, featured Beany and Cecil&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Clampett-s-Beany-and-Cecil/dp/630560925X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Clampett's: Beany and Cecil</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Clampett-s-Beany-And-Cecil-Vol-2/dp/B002DSP1KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil, Vol. 2</a>.

It's difficult now to imagine how good cartoons were at this fledgeling time. The 1959 show ran against ""Rocky and His Friends"", which must rank as one of the all-time great shows. The 1960 season brought ""The Flintstones"", which ran until 1966. Bugs Bunny also appeared in repackaged Warner theatrical cartoons this year. Along with the Oscar-winning rabbit, ""King Leonardo and his Short Subjects"" made their dubut, and were later syndicated along with Rocky and Bullwinkle shows. 1961 saw ""The Alvin Show"", ""Top Cat"" and ""Beany and Cecil"" take the stage, followed in 1962 by Hanna-Barbera's other early triumph, ""The Jetsons"". Along with the ""first family of the future"", ""Supercar"" arrived from the UK, the vanguard of the futuristic Supermarionation shows that would include ""Fireball XL5"" and ""Thunderbirds"", announcing to US kids that the future is now.

I never liked the super-violent ""Tom and Jerry"" shows, and I think that H-B's greatest achievements came after that, when they moved into gentler slapstick, their ""buddy"" cartoons, and the radio-like dialogue that typified the early shows like ""Ruff and Reddy"", ""Huckleberry Hound"", and Yogi Bear"". Not to mention the modern, appealing character design, the witty writing, and the brilliant use of limited animation in order to do the impossible: produce a season of TV cartoons for the price of one theatrical animated short. Aside from Casper, the other Harveytoons here, like ""Herman and Katnip"" do range into T and J territory, although perhaps not quite as violent. The writing is not particularly witty, but the goal for a theatrical cartoon differed from the later intent for a series: loud, fast, lots of ethnic jokes and stereotypes (because that makes characters immediately recognizable). Following radio and early TV, it's all Vaudeville: anything for a laugh (that gets by the censor).

However, as a kid I didn't see it that way. I had a talking Mattel Casper plush pal that I took everywhere. My sister and I devoured Harvey comics. My favorite was Hot Stuff, the Little Devil, of which no cartoons were made. Her's was Wendy the Witch, who very briefly appears in this series. I still love reading old Harvey comics. Interestingly, the on-screen menus for this series begin with comic panels being colored in, emphasizing the connection between the cartoons and comics.

As other reviewers have noted, this set is compiled from the 52 shows Jerry Beck put together in 1998 for Fox Kids. Each show has three cartoons, sometimes based loosely around a theme like fishing or space travel, and a piece of a cartoon called a ""Toon Take"". Some of the later shows have four cartoons instead of a TT. These shows, on four double-sided discs in a hinged package, include cartoons of Casper, Baby Huey, Little Audrey, Herman and Katnip, Buzzy the Crow, one-offs, and my favorite, ""Modern Madcaps"". These were simple, modern-styled,'50s one-off theatrical cartoons. Some of the older cartoons here also have redone, modern-look titles.

This is not the complete run of Harveytoons, as there were 78, and this set is 20 shy. Nevertheless, it's a great deal for 19 hours of cartoons for anyone interested in animation history, or who just wants to watch some cartoons. Show one a day to your kids (mix with other favorite cartoons) and you don't need cable. Onscreen menus let you select a show by number.

If you are a geek like me and wanted the cartoons... what this appears to me is a Saturday Morning Cartoons show that just used the old harvey cartoons. The original credits are cut, and worse the cartoons are cut up.
There are no menus as well.

Harveytoon series is more rewarding and considering how old they are... I guess Sony Wonders salvaged what they could. The quality of the dvds themselves are outstandingly brilliant. Very impressed! What a nice surprise - worth having despite any shortcomings.
  The DVDs are organized like this: Each track is grouped in a 4 cartoon composite or Episode 1ABCD 2ABCD 3ABCD 4ABCD etc. 52 tracks equals a total of 208 cartoon shorts on 4 double-sided and color-coded discs. I wondered how can 312 cartoons fit onto 4 dvds nicely? They Can't. Something had to be sacrificed. The first four seasons, without a menu is what you get and no special features; however, a menu list is provided by a The Harveytoon Wikipedia Website outline and  correspond with the episode disc order, last on the main menu press SHOWS for individual episodes. This should make things easier. As the label on the back says ""19 Hours"" is far from a dissapointment for me. I hope Sony Wonders is not finnished. With any luck Seasons 5 and 6 will be released some time soon. Then it will be complete(so to speak). Removing the discs from the book is risky, be careful not to break them in half. Anyway the Harveytoons are Wonderful!",1239062400,4,1613,5.29296875
2609445,4,B000GG4XWE,"By far, the biggest drawback to this set is the lack of useful menus, along with the fact that there is no included list of the cartoon shorts found on each of the 8 blank sides of the discs included in the set. This information can be found on the web, but it is awkward to refer to with every viewing. I have created an easily downloadable file which, when printed and carefully trimmed, will fit neatly within this set. Add my small booklet, and this collection that many would rate as only 2 or 3 stars becomes 4.5 or 5! I took the time to format the page, so all you need to do is log in, download it and print it out. It is my gift to all who love classic animation.

Go to [...] to download the file, and add it to your set. If you are contemplating buying the set and its lack of content description is making you think twice, by all means go ahead and buy it, then print the menu out when you receive it. I believe you will find it to be an invaluable addition to an otherwise frustrating package.  You won't be disappointed.",1219881600,12,1034,4.1138613861386135
2609446,5,B000GG4XWE,"This DVD of Harvey Cartoons is fantastic!  It seems it contains all or at least many of the episodes of the Harvey cartoons that were shown on TV in the 60s.  Each episode was a 1/2 hour's worth of the marvelous cartoons made by Harvey in the 50s and early 60s, maybe even the 40s.  Each cartoon is clear as a bell and feature Casper the Ghost, Baby Huey, Little Audrey, Herman and Katnip and other cartoons, some of which I had never seen before, and I am a big Havery cartoon fan. It contains four discs, each of which contains cartoons on both sides of the disc. I think this DVD collection is a great bargain and I am very happy I purchased it.",1208563200,2,648,4.168
2609447,3,B000GG4XWE,"I grew up with Harveytoons.  I've just turned 50 myself and remember many a childhood day was spent with these good friends on my TV.  I've not seen 97% of them in color, as we had b&w television until 1972.  By then, they were gone or very hard to find, and I was in high school.

However, I am so glad to have many great memories come back, especially a couple of my all-time favorites, La Petite Parade (Episode 40 on Disc 4, Side 1) and Out Of This Whirl (Episode 1 on Disc 1, Side 1).  Revisiting with Casper, Little Audrey, Herman & Katnip, Buzzy, Baby Huey and some I forgotten were a big treat.

My one regret is no bonus features, editing down most of the the opening themes to these cartoons, no complete Screen Song cartoons (only pieces tagged on to a 3-cartoon show).  A major bonus feature could have been the complete Casper, Little Audrey and Herman & Katnip themes, even if just the audio portion, as these Harveytoon Shows are creations from 1998.  All the credits are at the end vs. being with each short created digitally for the packaging.  I find the theme used for this new packaging a bit annoying compared to the original music from the cartoons.
Depeinding on how many cartoons of each series, would have been better to have a Casper disc, an Audrey disc, a Herman & Katnip disc, etc.  The Screen Songs and other miscellaneous could have been the final disc.  When they created these Harveytoon shows, it appears each has a theme of some kind.  One of the shows has all Boy Scout related cartoons, one has a Space theme, one Christmas, one Thanksgiving, etc.  It would have been better to present the cartoons as originally presented in full in order of release, be it made for the theatre or made for TV.

I am grateful that for what is presented, the color, picture and sound quality is excellent.  Some other public domain copies of some of these cartoons are horrible.  This is the major saving grace.

If you want to see these cartoons again, this is the only way.  I only wish it was a little bit better.",1205020800,2,2036,4.42741935483871

2609449,3,B000GG4XWE,"I'd forgotten all about these cartoons until recently which I'd watched throughout my youth. As a fan of these shows, it was great to see them again.

Purely from a nostalgic standpoint, if you're looking to remember some long-forgotten cartoons this collection is for you.

However, it fails in comparison to other DVD collections. As many have stated it lacks any kind of track listing. If you're a completeist, you're going to find cartoons missing (as well as the closing credits to some of the cartoons).

I'm glad I found it just to have a set of Harveytoons, but if ever a more comprehensive and better packaged set of these cartoons comes out, this set should fall by the wayside.",1198713600,,688,4.716666666666667

There are only the first minute or so of the Screen Songs included, NONE have the follow the bouncing ball segments with the sing a long songs and that was the sole reason I bought this dvd. The cartoons are great and the dvd is worth the price but it is not what I was expecting and I would not have bought it if I had know that the Sceen Songs were essentially not on the dvd.

2609453,3,B000GG4XWE,"First off, I want to say I was very glad to get these classic Harvey toons.  They look great, color is great, toons are still great.  What's really really lousy is that you can't get to any specific cartoons from the menu.  Menu?  That's a joke, practically speaking there isn't a menu.  AND THIS IS MY MAJOR MAIN complaint.  Horrible useless menu that doesn't list any, none, zero titles.  There is no way to get to any individual cartoon because they're all hidden inside their repackaged versions of ""Episode 1"" Episode 2, etc.  Each of the DVD ""episodes"" is a repackaged DVD version of an episode and each ""episode"" lists no individual cartoon titles.  What does this mean?  Let's say you want to watch a particular Little Audrey cartoon, or for that matter, ANY Little Audrey cartoon.  Good luck, there's no way to find it, no listing, no titles, no nothing on the menu, no listing on the box itself, no identification of any cartoon title or where in the world in the multi-double-sided discs to find it.  Disastrous DVD packaging because of the no menu style DVDs you get.  Also a major complaint, is that the introduction music beginning for each cartoon, the theme music for each toon if you will, the Casper song, the Herman & Catnip song, etc. they're all cut off after about 5 seconds, you get no opening theme credits for each toon and no complete opening theme for each toon!!!  One of my fondest memories of these toons is the theme songs used at the beginning of each toon, they're all chopped off after about 5 seconds, forget reliving these wonderful theme moments, they've been edited out.  Also the Harvey Giant Jack in a box himself, the opening is a NEWLY created opening, NOT the original Harvey opening.  The credits that run at the end of each supposed ""episode"" are also newly created, not original credits that originally appeared in the complete opening theme of each toon, not at the end of the so-called episode.  IF THEY HAD ONLY LEFT WELL ENOUGH ALONE AND NOT RE-CREATED OPENINGS AND EDITED THEMES DOWN TO NOTHING AND RECREATED CLOSINGS AND MOST OF ALL IF THEY HAD INCLUDED A MENU WITH EACH TOON'S TITLE LISTED, this would have and could have been an excellent set.  As it is, I am now re-recording the entire set, toon by toon and giving each separate toon on my own created menu a title so that in the future I'll use my own created discs that will have title menus that I can go to any specific cartoon I want.  Classic Media, you really messed up on this one.  By the way, they did a very nice job on their Mr. Magoo DVD set that is currently available.  On their Mr. Magoo set there IS a menu the DOES include titles for each individual toon that allow instant access to specific toon.  So it goes to prove that Classic Media can do the job right IF they want to.  The key to success?  DO NOT TRY TO IMPROVE AN ALREADY PERFECT PRODUCT WITH YOUR RE-CREATED BITS AND YOUR CHOPPING AND SLICING AND DICING CLASSIC THEMES.  I am disappointed.  One good note, the cartoons themselves look excellent, bright colors, accurate coloring, no fading, the picture itself is great looking.",1182902400,12,3112,4.552158273381295
2609454,2,B000GG4XWE,"I always expect complete credits on any video I buy. This CD did not provide credits.

2609476,3,B000GG4XWE,"Although I consider myself quite the cartoon afficiando, I admit I knew very little about Harveytoons.  Like most people, I remember Casper, and had a passing familiarity with Baby Huey, but that's about it.  So I was delighted to find this set, as I had seen almost none of these 'toons before.

Harveytoons may not have had the polish of Disney, or the go-for-broke antics of the best Looney Tunes, but the shorts here are pretty well-done.  And parents can rejoice...there's nothing remotely offensive in these colorful, kid-friendly cartoons.

Now, the DVD's themselves are another story.  I don't like the fact that I can't select individual cartoons.  They are grouped by episodes, with each one having a theme.  Also, the ""Toon Take"" short that end each episodes appear to be edited versions of longer cartoons.  Somebody please tell me if I'm wrong about that, but I'm sure something is missing.  Likewise, there are no credits for the individual shorts, just a title card.

Children and parents who watch these with their kids probably won't care too much about my minor complaints.  And like I said, the cartoons themselves are quite entertaining.  I just want everyone to understand up front what they're getting.",1178409600,3,1224,5.0
2609477,4,B000GG4XWE,"I just saw this a week ago and didn't even know it existed! Took me about 3 minutes to order it on Amazon. As a cartoon aficionado I knew I had to have it.  I used to love these Harvey cartoon as a child and wanted to get it for my children.  Besides the excellent animation, I always loved the music. The music fits each cartoon like a glove much like the great Warner Bros toons.  With that said, the music intros to each episode have been chopped for time.  I actually know all of these by heart and it's a little dismaying.  I know I'm nit-picking here but some of you will understand!  We move on. All cartoons are presented in segments of 3 with a theme throughout i.e. three cartoons with a bullfighting flavor, three about jazz music, 3 about boy scouts etc.  That's ok.  The cartoons themselves display very good striking quality with excellent sound through my home system.  Menus aren't very good and practically unusable.  If you click on ""episodes"" you get to choose each ""volume"" of 3 and not the exact episode itself.  As some one else stated on this posting, there's no included booklet and hardly any menu, so title selection is darn near impossible.  With all that said, I love these old cartoons and that's what the main thing is right?  Especially for the price it can't be beat!  Love the Baby Huey's, the Casper's (A GHOST!!) and especially Herman and Katnip.  Man, these guys are cruel! I always believed that Itchy and Scratchy were more patterned after Herman and Katnip than Tom and Jerry.  You may not get a booklet or very good menus but you do get 4 double sided discs with a ton of high quality Harvey Toons!! I give it a 4 for the price and the actual cartoon viewing value.  Go buy it for your kids now!(and yourself!)",1177372800,5,1750,4.41875
2609478,3,B000GG4XWE,"Well, as most of you know from reading other reviews, this is nowhere near the complete HARVEYTOONS collection.  In fact, I'm a bit disappointed that Classic Media didn't take the same idea they had with the DICK TRACY cartoon series and include a miniature HARVEYTOONS comic book wrapped in the package, but okay.

Packaging errors aside, I have to admit being entertained throughout each half hour as most of my favorite titles are included here--cartoons like ""DIZZY DISHES"" (LITTLE AUDREY), ""LA PETITE PARADE"", ""DANTE DREAMER"", ""OF MICE AND MAGIC"" (HERMAN & KATNIP--no doubt the cartoon that inspired the title of Leonard Maltin's essential overview of the art of animation in America), ""THE SEAPREME COURT"" (LITTLE AUDREY), ""HERMAN THE CATOONIST"" (HERMAN & KATNIP), ""GHOST OF HONOR"" (CASPER--both of these interesting for their impressions of life inside a cartoon studio), ""WHICH IS WITCH"" (CASPER, WENDY), ""FRIGHT FROM WRONG"" (CASPER--who didn't really have to take mean pills, or so it turns out, to find his truly sadistic side), ""MOUSEUM"" (HERMAN & KATNIP), ""MICENICKS"" (episode 25, for that reviewer who wondered), ""CAT-CHOO"" (KATNIP & BUZZY--and all BUZZY cartoons as the original soundtracks and voices were neatly left intact) and so many others that i half-expected...

...And even some that I didn't expect, like a wild toon called ""TV FUDDLEHEAD"", about the ultimate couch potato, so entranced by the tube that every waking moment to him is one big info-mercial, or ""POP CORN AND POLITICS"" an interesting animated essay on how one imagines a kid sees the office of President of these United States.  Cartoons like this make me wish that the folks responsible for physically transferring all this to DVD had been allowed to compile the actual theatrical prints with commentaries by Jerry Beck, who consulted for the actual syndicated packages here, and enough background so that viewers of all generations understand social commentary that might show up on occasion and caricatures of entertainers, like Ed Sullivan actually voicing is own caricature in ""GHOST OF HONOR"".

Well after most studios were starting to find shortcuts to their animation product, Famous Studios, a major East Coast operation for Paramount, was still doing full animation and coming up with some great scripts.  Not enough of the really interesting of these kinds of stories are included here in their entireties, but perhaps Classic Media could be persuaded to actually take the full leap and give us fully restored theatrical impressions of these characters, even with the HARVEYTOONS Jack-in-the Box logo instead of the original Paramount/Famous banner.  Just having the cartoons uncut in a future set would be enough for me.

But having some of the best of these cartoons even in edited form brought back vivid memories of the shows on which they played, hosted by the likes of Sandy Becker and Soupy Sales.  We need more clear-headed history of the art of animation so fans can know what eventually inspired shows like ""REN & STIMPY"" and ""THE SIMPSONS"" and others that sometimes give back-handed complements to the golden age.",1174176000,12,3123,5.192842942345925
2609479,5,B000GG4XWE,"I was very pleased with this set. A great price,very good color and

sound, 53 shows, over 200 cartoons. These were hard to find. It's not

perfect, no listing of cartoons and some toontakes don't have the openings.

This is a bargain though, no matter what anyone says.",1171670400,5,270,4.583333333333333
2609480,5,B000GG4XWE,"Watching these classic cartoons in the 70's when I was little boy was the greatest thing since slice bread I remember them all. Casper, Spooky, Baby Huey are my favorites (sorry Bugs). My 5 year old daughter can't get enough.....and ether can I. :)",1170028800,2,248,4.659090909090909
2609481,5,B000GG4XWE,"I bought this so that my kids could enjoy some of the ""real"" cartoons that my wife and I grew up on. We both remember racing to the TV to see these toons and both my 8 year old and 2 year old seem to love them just as much. What a nostalgia point for us. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to show the children what cartoons used to be like before Nickolodeon and the Cartoon Network.",1168387200,4,395,4.012658227848101
2609482,4,B000GG4XWE,"This is a collection of set half-hour (well, 21 mnutes to leave time for commercials) Casper and Friends TV shows. As the other reviews say, no booklet, some cartoons no titles, and worst of all, each ""show"" ends with a ""Toon Take,"" which is a severely edited cartoon clearly whittled down to fit into the half hour format. That last is unforgivable. BUT.... after waiting for years for these cartoons on DVD and even VHS and only finding the same few public domain titles mixed in with a lot of junk, at last we can live the nostalgia, even if not in an ideal format. I had to get it ~ I'm not holding my breath for a more complete release anytime soon. Obviously the producers decided it was going to serve mainly as an electronic babysitter for a generation of new kids who don't know any better.",1166572800,6,799,4.405405405405405
2609483,1,B000GG4XWE,"A horrendous excuse for a collection. Many of the shorts are cut and incomplete. Some of them have no title given, they just start up right after the previous toon. As others have said, there's no episode title listing any where in the packaging. I would have rather paid more money for a truly complete collection. Unless Sony Media changes the way it's doing these types of collections, I'll never buy another. It's a waste of money for the true Harveytoon fan.",1164153600,16,463,4.658536585365853
2609484,4,B000GG4XWE,"This comprehensive package (19 1/2 hours worth of Harveytoons) is not for the faint of heart - but if you can wade through the inevitable hours of tedium in store, you will be rewarded with an occasional gem. No need to gild the lily - such ""Madcap"" monstrosities as ""Turtle Scoop"" are among the worst cartoons ever made by a major studio. But, let's give credit where credit's due. There are amusing rip-offs of ""One Froggy Night"" (""Finnegan's Flea"") and Gerald McBoing Boing (""Bouncing Benny"" - which makes clever use of animated cut-outs) as well as some inspired originals (""Dante Dreamer"", ""Possum Pearl"", ""Grateful Gus"").
""Cat Carson Rides Again"" seems to simulate the earthy palette of ""Anscochrome"", a now defunct color process, briefly in vogue for period westerns; ""Cape Kidnaveral"" brings a ""Schultzian"" kidspeak  and intellectual precocity to the screen, years before the first ""Peanuts"" special. Among other highlights: the elaborate underwater spectacle of ""Casper's Spree Under the Sea""; ""Mousetro Herman"" which features one of the great original jazz scores in toon history - and ""The Cat"" (""Cool Cat Blues"") a suave, if little remembered precursor of De-Patie/Freleng's ""Pink Panther.""
  ""Boo Moon"", ""Audrey the Rainmaker"", ""The Seapreme Court"" and ""Mice-Capades"" (a grim entry from Herman and Katnip) are good, solid toons, that in a more just world, would have achieved cult status by now - and though the Casper cartoons generally adhere to the same tired formula, ""Boo-Hoo Baby"" and ""To Boo or not to Boo"" still seem fresh, with good gags and the usual treacly sentiment under control. Also worthy of mention - ""True Boo"" a warm-hearted remake of the Fleischer classic ""Christmas Comes But Once a Year"".
Such entries as ""Jumping with Toy"" (Baby Huey), ""From Mad to Worse"" (Herman & Katnip) and ""Fishing Tackler"" & ""Dawg Gone"" (Little Audrey) show the precepts of modern design applied with freshness and imagination.  In fact, later offerings such as ""Spooking About Africa"" and ""Ghost of Honor"" (both from '57) are as sleek and stylish as anything produced by Warner Bros., MGM, or U.P.A from that period, (and better than several oscar-winners I could name!).  All this from a studio (Paramount), which from 1950-on, was said to be in serious decline.
I know this collection is not anywhere near complete, (and the original credits are missing) - still, the visual quality is mostly first-rate, and you can't really argue about the price.  No matter how you slice and dice it...it's a bargain!  What are you waiting for?",1163894400,4,2543,5.0985576923076925

8131778,4,B000GG4XWE,"HARVEY TOONS-THE COMPLETE COLLECTION: It may not be ""complete"" or as well loved as the Looney Toons or Hanna Barbera's golden age, but this 19 hour collection of hard to find Harvey Toons is still a colorful, clever dose of nostalgia. The endearing but somewhat tame Casper the Friendly Ghost fares best when he deviates from formula...as in Ghost of Honor, where he learns how cartoons are made, a nice switch from his alliances with cute kids and even cuter critters. You'll also feast on funnier, less famous stars such as overgrown quacked-up duck Baby Huey, eternal dreamer Little Audrey, and Herman and Katnip (the poor man's Tom and Jerry, and almost as violent). Katnip pulls double duty as jive talkin' Buzzy the Crow's hapless hypochondriac foe, and there's a healthy dose of screwy one-shots called Modern Madcaps which are occasionally better than the starring features themselves. This calvalcade of toon utopia is beautifully animated, with solid voice work from Mae Questel, Jackson Beck, Arnold Stang, Jack Mercer, and Sid Raymond, and even comes with a couple of classic Harvey comic book pages...there are certainly worse ways you could spend your next few Saturday mornings.

8131783,4,B000GG4XWE,"I'm told that one cartoon on here is one that I thought was a ""Fractured Fairy Tale"" from the ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" series. This was one called ""La Petite Parade"", about a storekeeper in a town which held daily parades, who was troubled with a pothole in front of his shop. Every morning when the parade passed by, the tail end vehicle was a garbage truck which would hit the pothole and dump a pile of garbage in front of his shop. So he visits various government offices to complain, hoping that someone will come by and fix the pothole. Unfortunately the storekeeper is a bit too descriptive of the parade, even imitating the marching band;

""(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze King
(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze Premiaire
(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze Foreign Ministaire (boom-boom)
(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze Army
(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze Navy
(Ba-dada-duh-DAH) Ze Department Sanitaire"" (which is of course the garbage truck)

The problem is that in each office, officials mistake the storekeeper's complaint with some kind of entertainment audition and applaud him. When somebody finally does understand, the result is that rather than patch the pothole, they add a man with a pushbroom to the parade to follow the garbage truck.",1452124800,,1192,5.139175257731959
