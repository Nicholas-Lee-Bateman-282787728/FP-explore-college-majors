These conferences present a panel of ""Experiencers"" who tell movingly and convincingly of their out-of-body experiences, as many different kinds of experience as there are people it would appear.  The first-published book by Dr. Raymond Moody introduced me to the subject and I went on from there.

This film is spooky for my taste, which for me removes the authenticity from the presentation.  For  a more immediate and acceptable intro to ""Life After Life"" I recommend International Association For Near-Death Studies (IANDS), which found its beginning at University of Connecticut and Duke in North Carolina.",1467417600,,720,5.217391304347826
