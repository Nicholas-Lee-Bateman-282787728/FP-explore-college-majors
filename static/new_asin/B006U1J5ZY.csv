Check the reviews once it's out before you buy if you don't have a multi region player. I'm trading in all my single discs for about $5 each to recoup the cost. If you want to buy single empty blu-ray cases, print out some custom artwork, and display them that way. Hopefully the discs will come in smaller cases to put on the shelf. Then I can put the outer box away or display it. The U.K. version is $5.45 per film. Not bad! I'm not going to keep waiting for individual releases which come out 3 at a time.

The collection wasn't supposed to come with Skyfall... But mine did! What a great thing!

Absolutely great condition as well. I inspected the disks and it honestly looks as though they're in brand new condition even though I bought used.

5017609,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I was only 5 years old when ""Dr. No"" hit the theaters, and saw none of the Connery films in the theater. However, I've seen virtually every Bond film beginning with ""Live and Let Die"" in the theater. I saw all the early films many times on broadcast TV, and have seen ALL the films at various times on cable in normal resolution, and in HD where available. I saw many of the films on VHS, and have viewed them all on DVD ... excepting the Craig films which were available on Blu ray and which I purchased in that format. In short, I have far more than an above average familiarity with all of these films in most of the ways a person could possibly have viewed them. There are more die hard Bond fans than me, but I haven't missed many opportunities to see these films, and have seen each one many times, my favorites probably dozens of times.

I've sampled several of the films in this set with an emphasis on the earlier films, and those that were highly criticized in what is (at this time) the top spotlight review. I'll have to say that these films look great. As I watch them, I'll keep this review updated film by film to provide details of my reaction to each. I'm watching these Blu rays on an LG 7600 55"" LCD ... a set which always delivers sharp images and stunningly beautiful colors to begin with.

The case holding all the Blu rays is beautifully designed. It is essentially a book of Blu rays with two discs presented per page.

There is some criticism that the discs are difficult to get out of the cover, with some Chicken Little talk that you probably can't do it without scratching the media. You'd have to be pretty ham-fisted for that to be even a remote possibility. You'll quickly learn the little trick that gets them out easily. First, hold the ""page"" elevated slightly ... don't leave it flat down on top of the book of discs. That gives the page itself some flexibility. Then use the finger hole provided to elevate the disc from the page, and roll it out of the sleeve.

Sadly, the United Artists intro screen with their distinctive musical fanfare (which was present in the Special Edition DVDs) has been replaced with the MGM Lion and its roar. Don't get me wrong, I've always liked the MGM Lion, but that UA fanfare was always a nice psychological symbol for me that a Bond film was starting. It doesn't seem the same, somehow.

*** Dr. No ***
Of course, I first watched ""Dr. No"". The colors were rendered superbly, however they are ""warm"" enough that non-tanned faces seem a bit red. A couple of short sections of dialogue seem rushed, and are hard to make out as a result. The very short section of ending music is badly distorted. Those are the only flaws I noticed. Overall the film looks and sounds great. The special feature on this disc is a short documentary about the company contracted for the restoration, with discussions of their process and philosophy. For ""Dr. No"", they were able to scan the original negatives as filmed. In particular, the scenes on Crab Key during the day before Bond and Honey are captured are absolutely stunning.

Direct Comparison: I have the Special Edition DVD of this film, and compared it directly to the Blu ray in this set. Much of the DVD looks like you are viewing it through a screen door. Do you really want to be watching Ursula Andress walking up to the beach through a screen door? (That's exactly what it looks like on the DVD). I thought not. It might not be so noticeable unless you had just watched the Blu ray, which is very sharp and clear. The DVD also has numerous defects (dirt and film damage) which show up as random white and black spots appearing in most frames. Virtually all of those are eliminated in the Blu ray.

*** Diamonds are Forever ***
From the other reviewers criticisms of some of these films, it seems that he disliked the restoration of ""Diamonds are Forever"" the most, so I tried it second. The other reviewer called it ""brown"". I don't see it. Some of the scenes are dark, and in those scenes dark colored suits tend to blend into the background. However, the colors are vibrant. Skin tones tend towards tanned. Browns appear where the color should be brown, such as wood paneling and desert backgrounds. I watched this film ""out of order"" to see if I agreed with his knocks on it, and I did not agree. If this is the ""worst"" rendering in the set, this set is great. The special features for this movie are interesting. There is an interview with Connery from shortly after filming. There are a few short features showing the filming of some of the action sequences. My favorite was the Deleted Scenes, including an extended version of the Honeymoon Suite opening with Connery and St. John. It ends with a bit of dialogue not kept for the film that made me chuckle aloud.

Direct Comparison: Once again, I sampled the Special Edition DVD right after viewing this Blu ray. The colors in the Blu ray are a close match to the colors in the DVD, except that they are more vibrant and pleasing to the eye. Skins tones are very similar. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are presented in both formats with very fair skin tones. Connery's skin tone is somewhat more red in the indoor scenes of the DVD, and more tan in the outdoor scenes. In the Blu ray, his skin tones are uniformly tan in both settings. As in ""Dr. No"", virtually constant film damage/dirt is present in the DVD presentation, and virtually none of those artifacts remain in the restoration used for this Blu ray.

There is absolutely nothing satisfactory about either of the DVDs of the above two films once you've see the Blu rays. You simply cannot go back to the muddied colors, damage/dirt flashes, or annoying grain (which in my complaint is not true film grain but film AGE).

*** Goldeneye ***

I skipped forward (again) to this film, because I read a lot of criticism of the picture. Specifically critical reviewers claim that excessive DNR (digital noise reduction) causes the Blu ray to be a terrible viewing experience. While it may not be the sharpest Blu ray I've ever seen, these criticisms are completely off base. Some dark interior shots and sky backgrounds look a little grainy, but that is the case in a lot of Blu rays I watch (DVDs too). Many outdoor backgrounds in this film are very blurred. However, that was a ""depth of field"" lens decision made by the cinematographer, not something in the Blu ray transfer. That artistic choice is, I believe, rare in Bond films. It may have confused some reviewers who expect all foregrounds and backgrounds to both show full detail.

There was nothing about this presentation of the film that made me cringe, and much that I was very pleased by.

Direct Comparison: As soon as I popped this movie out of my player, in went the Special Edition DVD. The picture in the Blu ray is MUCH more detailed. Colors are good in both. Since this is a more recent film, there wasn't nearly as much film damage evident in the DVD as for the two movies described above, yet there were occasional flashes from dirt and damage. ALL of that is cleaned up in the Blu ray. The sound in the DVD is a little muddy, especially if you listen to it after just having viewed the Blu ray. The sound in the Blu ray is crisp, and special effects sounds are convincing. The DVD has a lot of color streaking that I did not notice when watching the Blu ray. Edges in the DVD are more ragged than in the Blu ray, as you might expect. Additionally, the image in the DVD seems to sort of flicker in the details, and that flaw is not present in the Blu ray either.

So while it is possible that this is towards the bottom of the barrel as far as the Blu ray transfers in this set are concerned (and I'm not totally convinced this is true), it is a MAJOR step up from the DVD.

*** Goldfinger ***

This Blu ray doesn't look as spectacular as ""Dr. No"", but the there aren't nearly as many spectacular outdoor scenes. However, all the damage specs from previous releases have been cleaned up. The criticism that the colors from the gold painted body are muted are fair. Compared to the DVD, the colors in the Blu ray are not pushed as much, particularly in that scene. However, the body DOES look gold, it's just not as bright. One reference for this is the red wall behind the bed. It isn't as red either. Again, the sound on the Blu ray is better than the DVD. The United Artist fanfare is present on both this Blu ray and ""Golden Eye"", I had worried that only the MGM opening would be on the releases for this set. The bottom line is that ""Goldfinger"" isn't a spectacular Blu ray, but it IS a BIG improvement from the DVD. Strangely, I didn't notice the film damage as much when I only had the DVDs to watch. But viewing them after these Blu rays makes the DVDs almost unwatchable. The difference is that great.

*******************************************************

I highly recommend the ""Bond 50"" Blu ray set. If you are a big-time Bond fan ... this set is essential to your continued happy existence. LOL",1503446400,25,9005,4.470480827754108

5017714,1,B006U1J5ZY,"The package was delivered promptly.  The DVD set was in excellent new condition.  I love the packaging.  The retro-forties style albums for the discs are very nice.  However, the DVDs have some real problems.  I bought the Bond collection that was issued in 2008.  Those DVDs played well until this year.  Suddenly most of the discs either would not play at all, or stopped playing part way thru the movies.  The first time it happened, I replaced Goldfinger with a new DVD that I purchased separately.  It is the same vintage and had a blip in the middle of the movie where the picture broke-up for an instant.  So many discs in that 2008 set had problems that I ordered this set as a replacement.  These movies have the same problems.  Some play well, some stop working part way thru the movie.  The discs for the last three movies from Casino Royale on play just fine, as they were made after the 2008 set was manufactured.  It is the movies that have a lead-in preview talking about Sony's great new digital process that have problems.  We bought a new Sony DVD player to see if it would play the discs any better.  It helped a little, but the only help was skipping past the trouble spots with pauses in the action rather than degrading into pixels as our old Panasonic player was doing.  As a test we tried some of the discs from this set in our JVC TV with integral DVD player.  It would not play them at all.  With it they either stopped working after the opening MGM ad or had a terrible looking video image.  Note that we have several hundred DVDs of all quality and vintage and these Bond films are the only ones with this problem.  I plan to return these and see if I can find a low priced set just to have the album-style anniversary package.  Then I will try to find old individual DVDs issued before the super-duper Sony digital process was used.  That process produces unstable discs.  I recommend avoiding discs made with that process.",1442620800,10,1952,4.4491525423728815

The only surprising thing is it is missing one Bond film.  One where Sean Connery reprises his role as Bond with Kim Basinger in Never Say Never Again.  It has to do with the fact that a different movie studio other than MGM make that movie.  They somehow had the rights to that specific Bond story and made it outside the MGM circle.  So if you like that movie and want it, it won't be in this collection.

We returned the first set when the third movie we wanted to watch stopped and started so much as to be completely unwatchable. Replaced it with a brand new set.

5017776,3,B006U1J5ZY,"Wasn't going to review this set because so many others have; but, after reading all the brief,  5 star comments; had to voice my objections.
The films themselves are good - I much prefer the early ones.  However, the quirky presentation in two cardboard books is very bad.  It's extremely difficult to get the discs out and in; fingerprints and scratches on the playing surface are guaranteed and the discs are quickly ruined.  I just finished re-housing the discs into proper cases- mediaxpo has excellent ones in varying sizes.  After spending this amount, one shouldn't have to spend more on decent cases.  (I've recently experienced similar problems with the oddly packaged series sets of Star Trek and Star Trek TNG and Warner's 100 movie collection.)
My set included the 22 films mentioned by another reviewer and 'Skyfall"" from 2012.",1425600000,2,840,5.0071942446043165

It's really nice to be able to just pop in a Bond film and kick back with a drink and enjoy a few hours of 007.  There are reviews that complain the color is slightly off on Goldfinger's suit or that some dialogue was off by .003 seconds and that was a horrible sin against the Bond franchise.  Whatever.  I think it's a great set and getting to see all the Bond flicks that I grew up with makes me happy.  Isn't that what Bond is all about?,1421971200,,551,3.9279279279279278

5017870,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I remember the beginning of the 50 years of James Bond films. I was too young to see them then, but I can enjoy them at any time now. I could have bought either the Blu-Ray or DVD, but I am finding the load times of Blu-Ray to be too long. The sound on my home theater system is wonderful and the picture from the DVDs is beautiful on my high-definition television. The movies from the 1960s look almost as good as 2013's Skyfall.

The boxed set is very attractive and stores 2 disks per page. I almost threw the plastic sleeves away, but I would recommend keeping them. I find that I can remove the disk without touching the surface. Some graphics from the movies would have been nice on the disks, but I guess black with gold lettering is very classy.",1408665600,,753,4.265734265734266

5017906,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I can remember for the past few decades wanting to buy the Bond movies, but the prices were just too high for me - usually around $15 a disc. I was able to pick this up for around $80 used and it was one of the best purchases I made. The version I got came with all the movies up to and including Skyfall, and I was able to buy it for around $80 which works out for around $4 per disc - awesome!

I enjoyed most of the movies, but I'm not a big fan the way the last movies have gone (the new Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall). Let me explain: in the older movies there is a clear-cut villain, with a definite plot to do something evil; hardly any shades of grey - and that is what I have come to expect from a Bond movie - action scenes, a good hero, some beautiful women, maybe a nifty gadget or two, and an Evil Badguy with some far-fetched plot to take-over or destroy the world. You might find references to older Bond movies, but each movie stands on its own, and is easy to follow.

The last three in this set are more of a ""who-dunnit"", with hidden motives, that try to look more like today's action movie, and try to be more true-to life; it is a little hard for me to explain - but when I watched these movies I found them harder to follow. They still have nice action sequences, but some scenes I could do without, like Bond being smacked in the coconuts with a knot on the end of a rope. (And then miraculously walking down a beach a few scenes later with no apparent damage). And at the end of of these, like Quantum of Solace I wasn't sute it WAS the end - had anything really been accomplished?",1402444800,,1621,4.0625

Being cardboard you will inevitably bend or crease either the case or one of the books.
One thing that I dislike about the discs is that you cannot go directly to the PLAY screen.
That option should be available for any disc with another option for those that like to look at all of the other c-r-a-p that you normally have to wade through before you can watch your movie.
Scour Amazon for better pricing. I was unaware that they had released a 23 disk set and found, just after my purchase, that it was the same price as the 22 disc set that I got at the time.. I already had the Skyfall Blue-ray but would have liked to have an additional disc.
Today I see that the price for the 22 disc set is much less but you never know what might happen down the road so spend a few minutes extra to see what's out there.

5017922,1,B006U1J5ZY,"This review is for the product; it is NOT a critical review of the James Bond series of movies, which everyone on the planet should have seen at least once by now.

First, the box is heavyweight and contains 2 ""books"" which have sleeves into which the BDs tightly slide, one disc per double cardboard page.  As the discs are supposed to be much more scratch resistant than DVDs, I wasn't overly concerned about that risk.  However, its nearly impossible to get the damned discs out of the sleeves.  Each sleeve has a slit opening with a slightly larger crescent opening to retrieve the disc, however, the center hole of the BD is completely covered by the sleeve, leaving owners having to grasp the disc on both sides (thumb and forefinger opposed) to yank it free of the tight sleeve, leaving finger prints on the readable side of the BD, while bending (flexing) the disc each time it is removed.  I think most rational owners would object to this.  And it doesn't improve with age (except for the one sleeve which tore as I fought to get the disc out.

Second, the damned discs won't play.  Please forgive me for the following rant, but I'm so GD sick and tired of movie factories corrupting the discs we pay for with ""special security encoding"" so that no one can possibly in any way humanly possible steal their precious property (the movie); even the federal government threatens us every, single time we watch the movie WE PAID FOR, with the ""FBI WARNING.""  Every time!  And we can't even skip ahead (except on some Universal series like Murder, She Wrote, and Northern Exposure, as examples -- thank you Universal)!  Now, with high-tech BDs, we get high-tech security coding; its so goddamned effective, I can't even watch the discs I paid through the nose for!  All was well for the first couple of viewings, but then Goldfinger wouldn't play...just sit blankly on a black screen at 0/81.  Then For Your Eyes Only did the same thing, even though I watched it the previous night with no problem!  BTW, my equipment is a 2-year-old Samsung 3-D BD player matched to a Samsung Smart TV.  After spending about 2 hours on the Internet trying to track down the problem, the 'Net proclaimed the problem to be the security encoding on the disc, and the only glimmer of hope was the suggestion to unplug the BD player and let it ""reset"" itself.  It worked!  But why in hell should I have to maneuver my furniture out from the wall to access the electrical plug to reset the BD player to get it to work with the security coding on the disc whose content I've paid for the right to watch??!  When in hell is our government going to start protecting the working class citizens of this country from the greed of the Hollywood machine?  Why is their right to protection from pirating so much more important than my right to view the product for which I've paid?  Damn, I'm angry.  Absolutely enraged...!

So, that said (thanks for your patience while I got that off my chest), I can NOT recommend this expensive 22- or 23- disc set until the government steps in to protect us from the security coding of the studios.  Noteworthy, I have had absolutely NO trouble with nearly 2500 DVDs which have been played on this and other players, and virtually no trouble with other BDs.  No, I do not think there is a problem with the discs, other than the security encoding the studios are allowed to insert to protect themselves at the expense of the legitimate buyers of their product.

DISCLAIMER:  For all those who think Amazon movie reviews should be ""Siskel and Ebert-esque"", sorry.  As I said earlier, in a product review, I want to know the good and the bad about the product.  The movies are great, and the discs (when playable) are very good quality; however, even after the e-reset, they continue to ""fail to play"" whenever they feel like it, so they get a ONE-STAR rating.  And I caution movie lovers to be careful about going full-tilt buying BDs to replace your beloved DVDs until someone starts insisting that consumers have rights, too.

5017924,5,B006U1J5ZY,This was a birthday gift for my husband who is a Bond fan. He thought it was the best gift ever!,1396828800,,96,3.619047619047619
5017925,2,B006U1J5ZY,"Lets start with the good first.  The movies themselves are all excellent quality, great picture and sound on all I have watched so far.  I am about 3/4 of the way through the collection now.  No problems yet with the quality of the discs themselves or with the picture and sound as others have said.  If it was just the quality of the movies that influenced my rating, it would be a 5 star rating.  But there are 2 other issues that bring the rating down, one of them a major issue for me.

The biggest issue for me with this collection is the on disc software that controls the playback of the movies.  Unlike every other Blu-ray or dvd I own, this set will not let you stop the movie and then resume it later.  You cannot pause the movie for too long, if the player times out and powers off from inactivity you lose your place in the movie.  Every other disc I have, you can press stop once to stop the movie, but then press play and pick up where you left off, or press stop twice if you want to stop completely.  If you pause any other disc and the player powers down, you can start it back up and resume where left off.  But not with these.  If you press stop, it stops the disc entirely and you have to start at the beginning and watch all the legal crap and preview and then try to navigate to close to where you thought you were when  you stopped.  And the chapter menu is not well laid out well, nor is it informative.  The same if you pause and the player powers down, you lose your spot and have to start up fresh again and try to find your spot.  I hardly ever manage to sit long enough to watch a long movie in one sitting, so this glaring omission with the disc software kills the whole set for me.  It is a major pain to watch all the legal crap while the disc is booting up and then have to try to search the chapter selections for where I left off when all I should have to do is sit down, press play and watch the rest of the movie.

The second issue is the packaging.  For a collectors set, the packaging is very bad for discs.  It looks nice on the outside, and inside.  Good graphics, nice and shiny.  But 2 things wrong with it, first and foremost is the way the discs are held in the package.  The packaging is like a large hardback book with cardboard pages.  The cardboard pages are 3 layers of thin paperboard with a slot cut into the outer layer on each side.  the Discs are then just shoved between the cardboard.  To remove the disc's you have to put your finger under the disc and touch the data surface so you can pinch the disc to pull them out.  No excuse for that type of packaging.  The other gripe with the packaging is the size.  I want my discs to be all fairly uniform in size so they can all fit on the shelves together.  This however is huge and not suitable at all for shelving with other discs being in a board game size box of 11""x7""x2"".  It should be packaged in more reasonable disc holders with plastic trays that have a button in the middle to hold the disc.",1396742400,49,3006,4.095890410958904

Nothing to add to the James Bond series.  You either love them (my whole family does) or you don't. De gustibus
What is irksome is the stupid inaccessibility of the ""menu driven"" discs. ""This operation is prohibited at this time"" seems to be the recurring theme.  If you can't finish the movie for some reason, the next day you are forced to start from the beginning and FF to where you were.  Hello! This is the twenty-first century.

5017930,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I had read another review which was very helpful. They had listed all the movies this series had and one thing I understood was Skyfall was not included in this series so I went ahead and purchased it separately, which was not the case. It wasn't until Birthday boy opened it that we discovered that Skyfall WAS included even though the online info on this item even said there was a slot in the back of it to hold the DVD, which also lead me to believe I needed to purchase it separately. Anyways, the birthday boy was extremely happy with his gift and I ended up taking the extra Skyfall movie! We Like how all DVDs are neatly organized & protected in their own slot. We love us some James Bond!!!!

5017937,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This is the ONLY Hollywood franchise that is standing up the test of time.  The MAIN reason why it's still good, even with the reboot with Daniel Craig as James Bond is because the current producers of Bond are Barbara Broccoli and Michael J. Wilson.  The daughter and step-son of Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli.  They started producing the Bond films starting with Pierce Brosnan's first time up as James Bond in ""Goldeneye.""

5017945,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Let me just say at the outset that I'm not going to try to sell you on the idea of owning this collection. If you're a Bond fan, you don't need to be sold. If you're not, no amount of talking about about pristine transfers and extras will make you a fan. For fans, this is a wonderful addition to your collection, even if you already own some or all of the films on DVD or even Blu-ray. The box set is gorgeous and well-constructed. One quibble: the way they've got the sleeves constructed makes the discs a bit tricky to slide in and out, so beware of that. Otherwise, this set is really nice. Haven't had the time to watch any of the extras and have only had time to watch a couple of the films (You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever), but I was pleased with the quality of the transfers and the audio and fully expect the remainder of the collection to be top-notch as well.

Again, Bond fan? You'll want this for your collection. Not a Bond Fan? Buy it and give it as a gift for someone close to you who is!",1393027200,,1015,4.126262626262626

5017948,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I have been a fan of the Bond franchise since I was a kid and marathons of the films would be on SpikeTV, and I even have the Ian Fleming novels (that I have yet to read). I had been eyeing this collection for a couple years and finally purchased it when it went on sale for $100. I don't regret my purchase, but I was disappointed that at least the early films are not in a widescreen format. I'm not sure if this is how they were shot or if I'm just not able to figure out how to change the picture format on my television/DVD player. I'd still recommend it to anyone interested, though. The packaging is nice and the DVDs are no-frills.",1392422400,,639,4.12
5017949,3,B006U1J5ZY,"It is nice to have a complete (as of Feb. 2014 when I write this) collection of the ""official"" Bond movies in one box set. I was led to believe by the description and reviews that there was a slot for ""Skyfall"" but not the disc itself. But the disc was there when my wife opened up the box (plus the cardboard placeholder)! Was I just lucky? I dunno. But don't necessarily order a separate copy of Skyfall till you look inside. YMMV.

It would have been nice for 007 to have gotten a touch-up for his 50th anniversary in the movie business, but some of the films are a little dirty, worn or rough. It's a new package, not a new collection. If you've already got some or all of these on DVD, you're not getting anything new bu the box.

The box is smaller that I thought it would be. The illustration makes it look much thicker, but it's really only about an inch. Neither good thing nor bad thing, just a thing.",1392076800,,911,4.2

This documentary is known to have been ported over from the DVDs but what isn't known is that here we have a totally REMASTERED version. That's right. The whole piece was re-cut from scratch. All the film clips are from the new HD source and also the photos that illustrate the piece were rescanned. Only the interviews that were shot in standard definition were upscaled. I have never heard of any company doing such an endeavor with a DVD extra before and I'd like to say kudos to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for this. It shows how much they care for the franchise and for the fans. I can't wait to check all the other films to see if the same has been done.",1388793600,,809,4.510204081632653

That being said, the quality of these disks is a little off - of the five movies I've watched thus far, two started showing unrelated subtitles about halfway through the movie, and another had a flaw serious enough to make it lose about five minutes of the movie. The subtitle issue was handled easily enough (by restarting the chapter), but the flaw was not.
If these movies were full of detailed visual effects, I would be disappointed and would try to find higher quality versions. However, for the price I paid (less than $4 a movie), this is a great bargain.",1387497600,,663,4.627118644067797

5018009,5,B006U1J5ZY,"""Bond 50"" is an incredible collection!  All the films look and sound extraordinary on Blu-Ray.  The audio and video is top notch (except a few scenes here and there).  From the first film to the last - all the way through.  Excellent transfers, tons of bonus features, great stunts, acting, stories, memories, etc.",1384300800,,314,4.867924528301887

5018013,1,B006U1J5ZY,"We were so excited to watch all the James Bond 007 movies.  However, the very first one locked up on us as well as more.  It would stop playing and go back to the beginning.  We are very disappointed and will be returning the set.",1384041600,,230,4.066666666666666
5018014,4,B006U1J5ZY,"This Blu-ray collection of 22 James Bond movies allows the fans of 007 to view and compare the movies. After doing so, most fans would agree that Sean Connery IS James Bond. I think Connery best personifies Ian Fleming's 007.
Among the movies themselves, I rate Connery's movies as the best, with GOLDFINGER being the #1 Bond movie of the entire franchise. GOLDINGER established the Bond movie formula which was adhered to through most of the franchise until the remake of CASINO ROYALE. YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THUNDERBALL are right behind GOLDINGER as being among the best Bond movies.
ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is rated by many as one of the best Bond movies with it's only real minus being George Lazenby who, fortunately, didn't return after his one appearance as Bond.
Roger Moore's THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is the best of the Roger Moore 007 movies. I like Moore's portrayal of Bond and think much of the criticism directed at him is undeserved.
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is the better of Timothy Dalton's two Bond movies, although both of his movies were subpar compared to the rest of the franchise. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is also composer John Barry's last Bond movie (Barry has a cameo at the end of the movie). With Barry's absence, the music for the Bond movies went into a downward spiral. It's fitting that the theme for DIE ANOTHER DAY is sung by a group called Garbage. SKYFALL's theme won an Oscar---so Barry should have won Oscars for GOLDFINGER, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE---their themes are clearly superior to the SKYFALL theme.
Among Pierce Brosnan's movies, I rate TOMORROW NEVER DIES, a dart at media moguls like William Randolph Hearst, et al. as the best of his group.
CASINO ROYALE is Daniel Craig's best Bond movie, and it's one of the best in the franchise. Although SKYFALL (not included in this particular collection, but included in the later version) earned over $1 billion in box office receipts and received much critical acclaim, to me it's a Bond movie in name only. Director Sam Mendes said he's been a Bond movie fan since he was a boy and even had a model of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 (like me) introduced in GOLDFINGER. So in SKYFALL, he resurrected the DB5-----and blew it up. With fans like Mendes, who needs enemies.
Among the collection are the really bad Bond movies including A VIEW TO A KILL, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and DIE ANOTHER DAY.
The collection does not include the original CASINO ROYALE and Sean Connery's last Bond movie, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, both of which are not official Bond movies from Eon Productions.
The collection has stunning remastered video (especially GOLDFINGER) and many extra features, including very good commentaries by Roger Moore for his Bond movies. The one minus in the special features is the absence of Sean Connery's commentaries. Among the collection's negatives is the deletion of the informative pamphlets for each movie that are included with the Ultimate Edition dvd sets. Another negative is the collection's packaging----each Blu-ray disc is inserted into a page-like enclosure. To remove and return the disc to the enclosure, you have to put your fingers directly onto the disc's surface which is taboo among dvd dont's.
Although Bond fans can buy the movies individually to avoid the bad ones, by buying the entire collection, you can compare and rate all of them. Viewing the bad Bond movies gives the fans a greater appreciation of the good Bond movies.
Overall, the collection is highly recommended.",1384041600,4,3539,4.860927152317881
5018015,5,B006U1J5ZY,"So nice having all the Bond movies in one nice collection.  So many classics in one place and it is enjoyable to take time and Bond my way through a couple of weeks of nightly Bond movies.  It is fun to see the progression over the years and to watch so many beloved characters through the years, none so more than the original Q.  Worth the money to purchase and it gives a look into part of Bond history.",1383782400,,406,4.113924050632911
5018016,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I purchased this set a few months ago and have finally viewed them all starting in August with a Sony BD player. I don't understand what the many negative comments are referring too. The color was perfect on all of them, once I selected the correct A/V mode. On my 80-inch Sharp, ""Movie"" mode gave perfect color and sharpness reproduction on all the movies, from ""Dr. No,"" to the two Danial Craig versions. It also works on DVD and BD movies. The sound was absolutely awesome reproduced through my 7.2 sound system. Keep in mind that the old movies were recorded in stereo, not surround. (A/V modes vary from various manufacturers, so you've got to try them all for each media you're playing.)

Not a single movie exhibited coloration or other distortion, which is a result of the oldest being remastered frame-by-frame at 4K from the original film from the cameras. As to the complaint that later remasters were done at 2K, also, that's more than enough for BD 1080p. (Consider that the later films were not 40 to 50 years old masters and were better preserved, not needing the extensive corrections.)

Note: Remastering at 4K allowed more corrective digitizing, and also prepared the old films to be re-released in digital projector theaters or as 4K BD, which is the latest 4K flat-screen TVs. (Some new movies are also shot at 5K.)

The only complaint I can muster, and it's my opinion, is that all of the James Bond actors varied in talent, but that's for another heated discussion.",1383264000,,1487,4.7335907335907335
5018017,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This is the essential Bond collection, it has all the special features that any die hard Bond fan would ever desire.  The blu ray picture is pristine, and this collection is a must have.  The only criticism I would have is that some of these movies are full screen and some of them are widescreen.  I bought this at Best Buy for 150 dollars, I recommend it to any Bond fan.  The DVDs are great, but Blu Ray is where its at!  Also the collection now includes Skyfall in most boxes so it really is the complete set.  For the people that are having problems with the blu ray discs: return them, get new ones.  I have watched every single one of my movies with no problems, it must be a manufacturer error.  This problem does not exist with all of the sets.",1383177600,,753,4.216783216783217

The person is a hardcore James Bond fan and was very surprised and elated about the gift. The fact that all of the films are in chronological order and included is a plus. The packaging is beautiful and I like the book format that the dvds are placed in. It looks expensive and seems like something a true James Bond fan would enjoy.

5018034,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I love this box set.  It sits proudly on my shelf in horizontal face-out position right between the likes of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Chronicles of Narnia"" (alphabatized by ""Bond"")

Very classy of them to include a slot for Skyfall.  Even after I already bought Casino and Quantum I still thought that at $149 it was totaly worth owning every film (FINALY!) in one set, organized chronologically.

I've been watching these over and over again since I was a kid.  I've owned them both on VHS, first run DVDs, and the Lowry Remasterd ""Ultimates"".  These, while probably not considered perfect to most hardcore videophiles and Bond Enthusiasts, are definately a few steps above the ""Ultimates"".  Diamonds are Forever is my favorite transfer, and Dr. No.  All of them are way better than the VHS versions, most of which were formatted, cropped, and mutilated beyond recognition.  The 4K scan of Dr. No. is amazing.  How they make a 60's film look like it was made last year is beyond me.  In particular, costume and set details are astounding.  I found myself analysing artifacts on M's desk!  They were mastered by the same company that did the Indiana Jones films.  Essentially, these Blus are modifications of the Ultimates.  They have almost all the same extras with a few new tidbits.  The docs narrated by Patrick Macnee are always entertaining, and the presentation looks nice upscaled in HD (with nice borders around original SD frame).  What's cool is they are all on the same disc as the film so you can pop them up on the fly and drop back into the movie after.  My biggist dissapointment is a lack of a ""resume"" feature which almost every FOX blu-ray has.  The menus are upscaled, flashier, yet re-hashed versions of the old ""Ultimate"" discs. Sometimes they are a bit loud and obnoxious but are still classy, if not a bit old fasioned looking.  They are similar in style to the Universal blu-rays.  Menu on the side bar, montage of the film in the middle.  I honestly would have liked to have seen a bit more creativity in the menus, especialy since this was a 50th release.  It's nice they are all the same on every disc though.

The box sets are nice, but the pages with the photoshopped images seem to be wasted space.  Would be cool if they included factoids and liner notes about each film.  It's that similar, glossy cardboard packaging that the Alien set has.  I don't have complaints about these boxes (like I said, the cover looks really nice on my shelf).

It's worth getting these.  I love all of the Bond films in their own ways.  They each own a spot in cinema history.  Definately if you are a Blu Ray collector you should have this set.  It will look like the crown jewel sitting on the shelf.",1381795200,,2711,4.606694560669456

I would have given 5 stars, however I think they could have included a short synopsis of each film. Also, I am a Bond fan, not a fan of any production company. I therefor believe that a FULL collection should include 'Never Say Never' starring the original Bond, even though it is a rehash of a prior Bond pic. My collection also includes the original 50's American Bond as well as the spoof 'Casino Royal'. The way I see it, a Bond movie is a Bond movie.

5018060,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This is an interesting Bond collection. It is one of those ""must have"" items I would suppose. It is a handsome looking package and the films are filled with crackling entertainment.

This is an interesting and perhaps definitive Bond collection. You get the entire series to date from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. This is one of those ""must have"" collections. From Sean Connery to Daniel Craig and think about that one moment. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig all played James Bond on the screen in in 22 films over five decades. The diversity of the films, the actors, the directors, the technicians and all the other filmmakers is astounding. We all have our favorite films and our favorite actors portraying James Bond. It is really hard to express an opinion here other than to say that this sums it up for the first 50 years and I am glad that all the films are finally in one set. Amazing when you think about it.

It is interesting at the 50 year milestone to reflect on the films and actors that have portrayed James Bond. I think we like all the films to some extent and some more than others. Some of the films are very endearing to us and others less endearing. We have our favorites. We can be passionate about such things. For me I suppose Sean Connery is the one and only James Bond. I grew up in that era. I lived through those magical times. The Bonds that followed are his and the original filmmakers' legacy. There is the natural progression of the series that continues to this day. The films I like in particular are DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. For one reason or another I find these endearing and I enjoy watching them over and over again.

Of all the actors that have portrayed James Bond I believe that Sean Connery embodied everything that there was that made his James Bond an icon. Of the actors that followed, my favorite is George Lazenby. He makes one film that is arguably one of the best and for the first time he brought some depth to the character that was closer to Ian Fleming's literary creation and never explored in Connery's films. George Lazenby looks very good and acts very good during certain scenes and moments and then in a split second his acting appears awkward. He lacked consistency in that department. Yet, overall he visually appears very confident, self reliant and has a certain self assuredness about him. That is the George Lazenby I remember and he was James Bond.

Roger Moore brought his own interpretation to the role. I thought it was fine. In the Roger Moore films the greater participation of the team of M, Q, Moneypenny and Fredrick Gray (a regular addition to the cast in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) changed and augmented the dynamics of the films. Soviet General Gogol (also added as a regular character in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME ) was also added into the mix. For me it all culminated in A VIEW TO A KILL. It is an end of an era in some ways. Lois Maxwell had been in every film as Miss Moneypenny and her playful banter with Bond first seen with Sean Conney in DR. NO finally came to a cheerful finale with Roger Moore in A VIEW TO A KILL. More or less, we saw them age gracefully and nostalgically over that span of time.

I like Timothy Dalton's James Bond. The films returned to a much harder edged Bond. I liked Dalton's thinking man's no nonsense approach. I liked his approach of taking charge getting the job done as was reminiscent of Lazenby's approach. I prefer THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS of the two that Dalton made, but LICENCE TO KILL is a much better film than first realized and it requires a closer look. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL truly comprise the end of one era as we see many of the filmmakers on those two films end their involvement with the series.

For me, GoldenEye and all the subsequent films up to and including SKYFALL have a different feel and look about them. Of the Pirece Brosnan/Daniel Craig era Bond films I gravitate towards TOMORROW NEVER DIES and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of QUANTUM OF SOLACE.

When I think of the James Bond series certain things or people come to a nostalgic mind. The music of John Barry, the sets of Ken Adam, Maurice Binder's gun barrel opening and the indelible image of Sean Connery are endearing to me.",1379030400,,4677,4.514757969303424

The video quality is excellent, especially for films that were made starting in 1962.  The original film (not a copy) was scanned frame-by-frame in 4K resolution, then restored by hand and the painstaking effort shows.  I'm watching the movies using an Oppo BPD-103 Blu-ray player and a Panasonic TC-P55ST60 plasma screen.  There are various ""extras"" on each disc, that range from pretty basic to excellent.  The packaging is beautifully done and is as impressive as the quality of the movies.  They had the foresight to include a slot for Skyfall, which had not been completed when this collection was released.  I have also purchased Skyfall to complete the collection.

A few things about watching these films:  it is fun to watch the technological advancements from film to film; watching the Bond cars progress from a Sunbeam Alpine to the DB5 to today's cars brings back memories of all those neat vehicles; and seeing the gadgets Q provides can make you smile.  If you are a Bond enthusiast, this is for you.  If you want the perfect reproduction like you saw in the theater, you might want to find a copy of the original film and use a projector.  As long as your firmware is up to date, you should have no problems with any of these disks.  Enjoy all the pluses and minuses . . . but ENJOY these films!",1378598400,,894,4.192982456140351

The films do represent the film making styles of the times they were made in. So again, I'm not going to praise one over the other, as each is enjoyable in their own right.

The only problem that I have is with the audio on some of the movies. My tv and blu ray player are on the default settings and while ""You Only Live Twice"" sounds great, ""Thunderball"" is barely audible. Tweaking the settings didn't seem to help much. So quality control seemed to be lacking in that area.",1378080000,,729,4.27536231884058

Thankfully, there is an empty slot for Skyfall so you can have all of the movies in one spot, but why not just bundle it in there?",1375747200,,270,3.890909090909091

5018127,4,B006U1J5ZY,"OK so this isn't really a review I'm reluctant on pulling the trigger on this collection cause I was reading the lower starred reviews saying that some of the discs don't play in some blu ray players. I use my ps3 as my bluray player, I was just looking to see if anyone else knew if they played fine on there ps3. I'm a huge James Bond fan and I've been eyeballing this box set for awhile. So I'd really appreciate some clarification on this as soon as possible so I can jump on this discounted price. Thanks!",1375660800,,510,4.214285714285714

5018131,5,B006U1J5ZY,Love this collection. It is perfect. Just wish it came with sky fall now since the movie is out but it is not difficult to get it on its own and add it to the collection.,1375574400,,170,3.75
5018132,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I bought this set for myself a few months ago and have loved it! The only complaint that I have is that the audio for some of the movies is a bit wonky. There scenes where two people are talking and it will cut between the sound from a mic on that person to an area mic that seems to just be picking it up in the background. Other than that occasional issue, the video quality is great and I have been fully enjoying my second watch through of the entire set.

Video 10/10
Audio 8/10 (due to above stated issue)

You could buy all the individual DVDs for about this same price, so you may as well get them on Blu-Ray and enjoy the extras.",1375574400,,638,4.055555555555555

You watch a movie to see all of it and this situation was bad news. I had trouble with ""On Her Majesties Secret Service"" and ""You Only Live Twice"". Way too much money for movies you cannot watch to the end. Do not recommend them!",1375488000,,316,3.953125

Anyway, this is a great collection Bond movies except the sleeves that hold these blu-rays are very tight to deal with, to the point of maybe damaging the disc.
Otherwise, I started to watch them from the beginning and kind of quit with Halle Berry. Good thoughts!",1375315200,,443,4.414634146341464

I have exactly what I was looking for as a Christmas gift for my husband. I think it was a great purchase and don't regret it one bit.  I had gotten the DVD collection.  I guess what it all boils down to is what it is that you are looking for.  If you are looking for a ""collector's"" set, I think you may be kind of disappointed, only due to the box that it is in.

The Bond Girls are shown for each movie along with the year of each movie and some small still photos from them.  The discs are all uniform in appearance with the name of each movie on them.  Really nice quality.  I watched Dr. No last night and was very impressed with the quality.  I wasn't expecting much from a movie filmed in 1962.  However, it looked pretty good.  The sound was OK.... I bet they get better as the movies get later in the series.  I bought the Blu-ray version.  I am not sure how much it would cost to buy them all individually.  Plus, wondering if you bought the best quality version... This kit takes all the guess work out and you will receive them all in one nice package.  There is even a place for Skyfall to be added if you buy that disc.  It comes with a fake Skyfall cardboard disc.  The only issue I have is that the discs are a little hard to get out... Not a problem really though... All in all, this is a really great set.",1374537600,3,1077,4.215686274509804

5018198,5,B006U1J5ZY,They did a great job converting the older films to blu-ray and I liked the way the whole set was presented. The whole box set doesn't take up much room even though it contains 25 movies. I'm very pleased with the purchase.,1370822400,,222,4.309523809523809

The packaging is excellent. Two hard cover books in a case with one book containing the movies from 62-81, the other from 83-12 (Does not contain Skyfall but has a open space for it) and a bonus disk of materials.

I have only watched a few of the Blu-rays but the picture quality is excellent. I was shocked by how crystal clear the images are in Dr. No although the sound was not quite as good.

I picked this up on one of Amazon's Black Friday sales for 1/3 of the list price but even at the standard price it is a great deal!",1370649600,,644,4.17741935483871

Skyfall's already been released.  Despite getting a great price for 22 Bond movies, I felt jypped.

Also, the slots that the discs are in are very tight and can potentially scratch the discs.  why manufacturers package optic media this way escapes my comprehention.  just be careful sliding the discs in and out, and i'd recommend getting a few jewel cases to house the discs instead.",1370390400,,643,4.738738738738738

5018211,3,B006U1J5ZY,"The quality of the picture was very good; however, the sound was over-done. When setting the volumn for spoken dialogue, the sound was good until there was a car chase, plane takeoff, etc. Then the volumn went so loud that I had to use the control to lower the volumn. When the dialogue began again, I had to raise the volumn again. This process went on throught the whole movie. (All six DVD's so far).",1370131200,,403,4.386666666666667

After hitting the low price at 2013 christmas time, and then went out of stock, I realized that this was a must have. Worth every penny! The quality of all the films is good, but the older films show syncing issues from the conversion to blu-ray. Overall, they look great for how old they are.

Recommended for any bond fan or anyone looking to add great, action filled movies to their collection.",1369612800,,537,4.424242424242424

We were impressed with the picture quality (they did some updating, clean-up, etc.).  However, we were VERY disappointed in the sound quality.  We had to turn the TV volume way up to hear the dialogue, but then the action sound was almost deafening!  So, we had to keep turning the volume up and down because action scenes got way too loud.

After doing such a nice job on the picture quality, why didn't they use a good sound mixer/tech to adjust the sound balance better than this?  Disappointing.",1368662400,3,596,4.472222222222222

5018232,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Previously, I had only seen the Daniel Craig Bond movies, but I wanted to formally get into the series by starting from the very beginning ""Yes, I know it's not required to watch the films in order."" But for that reason, and for the reason that James Bond is one of pop culture's biggest icons and an indelible piece of film history, is why I picked up Bond 50.

Chances are, if you're deciding whether or not to pick this set up, you already know what to expect. 22 films, 1 spot reserved for Skyfall, and 1 bonus disc, all housed in fairly attractive Digibook cardboard casing. In addition to the films, you get over 120 hours of supplemntary features to enhance your movie pleasure and James Bond knowledge. Yes, some of the discs have restoration problems, and yes GoldenEye shows signs of heavy DNR, but for the most part all of these films are a significant upgrade to their DVD counterparts. For its asking price, if the asking price is still within the reasonable range of $150.00, it's a bargin.

In their review of Skyfall, Red Letter Media astutely pointed out that James Bond has been around for almost half of all movie-making history! That's an incredible feat of longevity. So if you're interested in James Bond, spy movies, or even film history, you owe it to yourself to see why the series has lasted half a century. I'm already looking forward to the next 50 years.",1368662400,,1383,4.57258064516129

I would love it if all the actors from the older movies would have been able to see themselves in HD.  For those who have I'm sure they're just as shocked... Truly magical.",1368489600,,332,4.140625

It is pretty funny watching the new Daniel Craig bonds and then watching the older ones side by side.  They seem so cheesy, but I love it!  The packaging is a little weird, but nothing worth taking a star away.  The box doesn't really fit in a normal shelf with my other blu rays, and the individual holders can be difficult to get the discs out.

These movies are stored in a book format (approximately 7""x11""), not in nice plastic Blu-ray/DVD cases that fit perfectly in your storage cabinet.

HOWEVER, there is a spot in this set for Skyfall. After searching every where online, I could not find a matching Skyfall disk.

The discs do not come in individual cases, they are in slots in a book that slides into the case. I am not a huge fan of that, but the book is rather nice. I also like that there is an empty slot to put the new Bond movie SkyFall in when it is released. However, I think there are some more Bond movies to come out, which obviously won't go into this set and will have to sit along side of it.",1366329600,,479,3.8484848484848486
5018275,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Well this one is a no brainer, it's Bond so of course it's awesome. Well ok it's awesome if you disregard Casino Royal which was just crap in my opinion. The movies look absolutely wonderful in HD, however in some of the movies which mind you I've only watched about four of the films so far. Some of the colors are too crisp and you do loose some of the luster that you had in the original movies. Like in Goldfinger the room as a whole is no longer lit up in essence of gold when he finds the gal covered in gold and there were other scenes where it just didn't seem like the gold gave off as much of a presence. I think that changes like this is just mainly do to the fact that the movies have been sharpened up and some of those fixes could have just been glare from light sets that was never suppose to be in the scene.",1366329600,,824,4.0

It is great to sit back and watch the series unfold over the last 50 years. I have personally seen all of the films at the movie theater and now can watch them any time I choose.

I would recommend this collection to many of my other friends who happen to be just as enthusiastic as I am.

5018286,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The biggest and best way to celebrate James Bond is here with the Bond 50 Blu-Ray box set, a must buy package that contains all 22 Bond films. With the 23rd James Bond film, Skyfall, just around the corner, there is no better time than now to invest in this fabulous box set.

Bond, James Bond is an icon, a Hollywood legend and a hero to many. Hes one of cinemas longest running franchises and deservedly so. Over five decades and now 23 films, the super spy has brought us adventure after adventure and rarely, if ever, does he let fans down. James Bond is one of cinemas most beloved and enduring characters and its about time he gets his own boxset.

From Dr. No right through to Quantum of Solace, every Bond film is included here, as are all of our favorite stunts, Bond girls, gadgets, cars, opening credit songs and more. The only thing missing is the 1967 Casino Royale parody and 1983s Never Say Never Again, as both were made without EON Productions involvement and due to rights issues, they couldn't be included.

Having all the Bond films housed in one boxset really makes for a great viewing experience and though some films stand out more so than others (Goldfinger being one of the best Bond films ever and Moonraker being a bit too silly), every film is an absolute blast to watch.

It would be redundant and rather pointless at this stage to review each of the 22 films in this box set. If you're reading this review, youve likely seen most of the Bond films, if not all. So, instead of doing into depth on each one, Ill just provide a brief overview of the box set, run down the audio, video and special features, and try to drill into your head why you NEED to buy Bond 50.

Housed in a slipcover box youll find two books that when opened, hold the discs (two per page). The discs are arranged in chronological order and the pages of the book have images from the films. Theres even an extra spot for Skyfall. Its an excellent piece of packaging and one that complements the classy style of the titular character himself.
When it comes to the video and audio, this box set is an absolute winner. Even the older films, like Dr. No and From Russia With Love, look gorgeous (despite some dust specks and whatnot). Crystal clear and free of compression issues, this is the way that the James Bond films were meant to be viewed. The films that have already seen a Blu-Ray release are identical to their previous versions and the ones that are appearing on Blu-Ray for the first time are very easy on the eyes.

Of all the films, Goldeneye is the only one with any real noticeable issues. Thats not to say that it doesnt look great, it does, its just not as sharp as the rest of the film. Of course, the newer films look better than the older ones but given the circumstances, each title looks nearly flawless.

Audio is equally as good. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtracks pack quite a punch. Now, a lot of the films were produced before the 5.1 era and in that case, they include the original mono and stereo mixes. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just something to note. Dialogue is crisp and clean on the newer releases and even on the older ones its solid, though there is a bit of crackle and pop here and there. Add in great atmospherics and a ton of depth and you have some really good audio tracks.

Now, if you already own the Bond films on Blu-Ray (13 were made available in the past with the other 9 now on store shelves), you will be double dipping here. The discs hold the same special features as the original releases did, save for a few extra bits here and there. That being said, there is a bonus disc included in the set that houses a handful of new special features.

You can check them out below, though nothing particularly stands out.

World of Bond: Title Sequences: All the title sequences in a row, amounts to a little over an hour.
World of Bond: Gadgets: A quick montage of some of Bonds best gadgets.
World of Bond: Villains: Another quick montages dedicated to the villains.
World of Bond: Bond Girls: A montage focusing on the Bond girls.
World of Bond: Locations: A quick look at some of the more exotic locations that the series has visited.
World of Bond: Bond in Motion: A very quick look at some of Bonds best vehicles.
Skyfall Videoblogs: About ten minutes of promo material for Skyfall
Designing 007: Fifty Years of Bond Style: For about four minutes we get a look at the series from a design point of view, everything from costumes to props is touched upon.
Being Bond (1080p, 3:08): For a couple minutes each of the Bond actors speak on their experience playing the character.
Unless you already own a handful of the Bond films Blu-Ray, you cant go wrong Bond 50. The new special features don't amount to much more than fluff but considering each film has its own features ported over from the original release, its easy to overlook the fact that the new features are useless. That minor hiccup aside, everything else about the set is fantastic. The films look and sound beautiful in HD, even the older titles, and they're all just so much fun to watch. Everything about the package is just so well done, right down to the packing and housing of the film.

If you're a James Bond fan who has yet to invest in the series on Blu-Ray, this is an excellent box set that will provide you hours and hours of enjoymen",1365811200,2,5372,4.438133874239351

The LaserDisc's were good transfers but the idiot that decided where the sides would break must have been high on something.
The BluRay  picture quality on transfers of Dr. No, From Russia With Love, and Goldfinger were incredible.
The audio on all discs does leave something to be desired.
The dynamic range is so wide that during quiet passages I had to turn my volume up past ""11"".
Then I had to quickly turn it back down again the very next scene to prevent blowing my speakers.
Digital sound is good when done right, but I wonder if the people doing the audio ever listen to the quality of their work.

I grew up watching James Bond since I was a kid. I have seen all the movies in just about every format that it came out in (TV,VHS,DVD) !! And I got to say. this Blu-Ray collection just blew me away!! to compare the old versions to this Blu-ray collection, it's like holding a candle to a spot light !! It's that dramatic !! I read some reviews on here before I bought it, and they were nitpicking about the quality of the picture, trust me, it looks fantastic !! I think my only beef is that the older films are in the Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1 (no bars) and the newer Bond films are in the Aspect Ratio: 2.39:1 or 2.40:1 (Bars) !! I'm not a big fan of the BARS!! I just feel that if you got all that space on a Blu-ray disc, use it, I don't care if you filmed it that way, give the customer a full picture !! (OK, I am done with my rant)!!

I saw every film in the theater upon it's release, owned the VHS collection, owned the DVD collection, and now this.  I have watched James Bond films 100's of time, but seeing these classics in blu-ray was a life altering experience. Seeing a young Sean Connery at his best in the sharpness and clarity of blu-ray was like seeing the film for the first time.  I saw things I never noticed before and am amazed at the crisp, precise details that have been hiding from my eyes all these years. I haven't gotten through the 120 hours of bonus materials, but trust me, I WILL.  From the off handed coolness of Sean Connery and George Lazenby, to the corny movies of Roger Moore, the bad hair films of Timothy Dalton, the over acting of Pierce Brosnan, to the much needed re-imagining of the character by Daniel Craig, there is everything you could want or need in the James Bond lore here.

5018347,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Bond 50 had the best Home movies from behind scenes ever for Connery & Moore Bonds
None for Dalton & Brosnan.

Had too little on Bond props, FX, Tech, modeling  alone

IE making Strombergs Atlantis model
Or Moonraker space station
or other villan bases like You Only Live Twice Volcano rocket base

More could have been done IE add 1 hour disc to Bond props, FX, modeling
& 1 hour to the Aston Martin, Lotus cars Bond drove.

Maybe Bond 60 might be better

Great disc to view the Theme music per movie by title was a real hoot.

Would have liked to see concept art for next Bond planned.

Or Bond geneology disc from Dr No to Next Bond movie
clips from scenes, FX, modelling.

Classic gift set for any Bond fan

Darn no martini came with it.

Or fine Balvenie Scotch whiskey.",1364169600,,775,4.3125
5018348,5,B006U1J5ZY,"First, let me say that I have seen every Bond movie as it was released in the theater.
This collection is a faithful reproduction of each movie as it was technically produced at that time. If it was produced in stereo, you get stereo. If it was produced in 5.1 surround, that's what you get. The video quality in the older movies is suprisingly excellent.
The packaging is rather ingenious and worthy of display anywhere in the home.
I am quite proud to own this collection.",1364169600,,474,4.523255813953488

5018350,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This collection nicely condensed my whole previous bond collection into a much smaller space. The movies look amazing, and special features are going to make me a trivia master. The package is produced off of MGM's copy rights, which means you are missing three Bond movies in this collection plus the newest Bond movie, which a space is provided for. The American version of Casino Royal, and Never Say Never Again are missing. The other Bond movie isn't worth mentioning, because of poor production quality and a plot that can't be followed.",1364169600,,543,4.913043478260869

the box is sturdy and great to look at while displayed on my shelf. the movies are, of course, exemplary as they should be. bond is timeless and so is this set. to have all available bond movies together in one set on blu is a wondrous thing. the pictures are great in hd and are a treasure to watch over and over. highly recommended.",1364083200,,622,3.905511811023622

Depending on how much you can sit and watch at one time this can be several weeks of entertainment, fun action/adventure humorus entertainment.  It's great to watch them in order and see how society and technology has progressed over the decades that Bond has spanned.  Even if you've seen them all before if you pay attention to the details such as; clothing, jewelry, hair styles, the way they talk, hotel suites, music, dancing, cars, resturants, cigarette smoking, etc and of course the Q gadgets.  It 's a fun way to enjoy the movies all over again.",1364083200,,631,4.7

5018371,5,B006U1J5ZY,"No point in reviewing the movies- Cause they're just great. Regarding the Blue Ray transfer I would rate it excellent. Realistic looking colors, sharp details, everything looks pretty darn good even before you consider their age- Dr No, was released in 1965. Most of them, but not all, are the new 1.77 aspect ratio to fit the currently produced 16:9 TV's, with maybe three or four movies being the common film standard of about 2.35 aspect ratio, which is the next best AR. I can't rate the 5.1 sound, but the sterio signals through my TV speakers seem OK to me. And how about $128 for the entire twenty two movie set of Blue Ray's? That averages about six dollars per BR disc. Every Bond fan has to like that.",1363910400,,711,4.476923076923077

I checked back periodically over the months on Amazon, but no new low price offer was seen. I bought it at a good price at Costco, but didn't use it. Then I was advised by Amazon of their new low price, so I returned the first purchase & bought this one. The price wasn't as low as Amazon had previously shown, but it was very welcome to me.

5018379,4,B006U1J5ZY,"For the A/V geeks picking apart the picture quality... give me a break!!  These movies have been beautifully enhanced and look awesome.

The only drawbacks are slightly odd packaging that makes removing the discs a little tricky (but bearable), and a pretty lackluster 'bonus' disc, which was just thrown in to round out what would've been an extra space in the box.  The segment they claim is a set of ""interviews with every actor to play Bond"" is a ton of random movie footage followed by like one line from each actor.  The whole thing is really barely longer than a trailer and is absolutely nothing insightful or interesting.  But really, there's plenty of bonus stuff and featurettes on the movie discs themselves which actually DOES pull the curtain back, so no harm, no foul I guess.

Great set!  I love it.",1363824000,,815,4.697183098591549

I never got a chance to see most of these movies in the theater, being 24 and all, but now I've had a chanced to see the remastered versions on blu-ray. I had heard most of these movies were remastered very well, a couple were not, I really didn't have anything to compare it to, so to me they all looked superb. I've seen movies on blu-ray that were bad upconverts and were quite grainy, these weren't even close. All 22 films together, plus the one slot for Skyfall (which I have as well) means I can watch all 6 reincarnations of 007 anytime in glorious HD!

5018462,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Of course I love the Bond movies, or I wouldn't have bought this set. For the price you can't buy them individually. At almost 10 dollars a movie for the older ones, that's almost $250.00 to buy each, value caught my eye. The biggest thing is the transfers which I think are incredibly done. These movies, especially the ones from the 60's, look ans sound better than ever. I would recommend this to everyone out there who is a fan of 007.",1363478400,,439,4.365853658536586
5018463,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I like having all of the BOND films in one place.  Then when wanting to view one of them it is just a single place to look for it.

The films are just fine",1363478400,,155,3.5294117647058822
5018464,5,B006U1J5ZY,This is a must have collection for any fan of the James Bond movies and was a steal at the price!,1363478400,,97,3.6666666666666665
5018465,5,B006U1J5ZY,I love all the Bond movies.  HD quality sold me on this one.  It was too good of a deal to pass up.,1363478400,,99,3.260869565217391
5018466,5,B006U1J5ZY,Haven't wanted them all but the quality is amazing. Definitely a worthwhile investment for any Bond fan. Only trouble is picking which one to watch next.,1363478400,,153,4.923076923076923
5018467,5,B006U1J5ZY,The ultimate Bond collection for a Bond fan. The conversion to Blu-Ray is good and the books for the movies are very detailed.,1363478400,,126,4.521739130434782
5018468,5,B006U1J5ZY,This is going to be a birthday gift. So I hope all the dvd's are good. I did the pre order and it idid tack soom time,1363478400,,117,3.3703703703703702
5018479,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Really great to see the Bond movies in HD, although takes some getting used to. I forgot how much the sound fluctuates in the older movies (quiet talking w/ LOUD action scenes). Liked that they thought enough to leave an open spot for Skyfall.

Overall, very satisfied with this set.",1363478400,,283,4.66
5018480,5,B006U1J5ZY,The older bond movies have never looked or sounded better. The collection is a must for any bond fan. Just the remastering of the Sean Connery movies make this box set worth while and the hours of bonus features are worth watching on there own.,1363478400,,244,4.444444444444445
5018481,5,B006U1J5ZY,"It's all the Bond movies in one package.  Very affordable. The packaging was actually a lot better than I expected it to be.  The box is sturdy and shiny, made to be shown off.",1363392000,,176,4.147058823529412
5018482,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Finally the complete set all in one, now all I have to do is sell all my small sets and single dvd bond series and my life will be complete.",1363392000,,140,3.7
5018483,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I have wanted this collection for some time.  It was available late last year for $99 but here on the West Coast all had been sold.  The most recent extended discount came at the right time.  I'm a happy collector now.  All are in dramatic color.  Oddly, some come with Spanish subtitles, others not.  ""From Russia With Love"" comes only with Mandarin subtitles.",1363392000,,361,4.650793650793651
5018484,5,B006U1J5ZY,"So different than the novels, but filled with action, fascinating technology, beautiful women and the incomparable Bonds.  This is a great set to own so you can relive the Bond action and charm over and over again.",1363392000,,214,4.783783783783784
5018485,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I tried to list the EON Bond Films in order of events (i.e. Bond receives his 00 status etc., etc). In no way is this perfect and by no means is it a ranking of best/worst film. There are obviously some problems such as ""Q"" and Moneypenny (I am theorizing that Moneypenny is a code-name and not her actual name). Thoughts, suggestions and criticism  are welcome.

5018488,5,B006U1J5ZY,I never realized how  good the the quality of the acting and production in the 007 series actually was. Also the blue ray process on my flat screen makes it better than the Theater.,1363392000,,181,4.323529411764706
5018489,5,B006U1J5ZY,"First I would like to say that this set is terrific and worth the money. Over the years I've owned many incarnations of the Bond movies. VHS, CED, Laserdisc, DVD, and finally Blu-ray. This set is the definitive collection. Not just in picture and sound, but also packaging. Great to have them all together in a really spectacular box with a space for the newest Skyfall. The thought of everything! I am so glad I purchased this set.",1363392000,,432,4.551282051282051

I do recommend this for any one who love BOND.",1363392000,,260,4.22
5018492,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I would have given 5 stars, my only complaint being the missing ""Never Say Never"".  I know that was not part of the package, and understand it is a different director, but for me it's needed to complete Bond!",1363305600,,208,4.333333333333333
5018493,5,B006U1J5ZY,Excellent service by Amazon. Excellent sale price for the entire 22 film collection of James Bond .-A great sale price for the James Bond film Never Say Never Again should be found by Amazon to complete the collection  sterle point,1363305600,,231,4.775

5018504,5,B006U1J5ZY,"All the movies are here, presented in a beautiful hard page booklet that displays nicely. The quality of picture is fantastic from these refurbished films and the sound is spectacular. You come to expect that with blu rays, but it's nice to see the integrity of the film remain in tact.
Last, I'm not really into bonus features, but it is astonishing how much extra material there are on these discs, not to mention the one dedicated entirely to extras.
Overall, best and largest presentation of a collection I've seen. And if you're even considering getting these on regular DVD to save some money, you are a cheap skate.",1363219200,,622,4.715596330275229
5018505,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I'm having trouble with almost every disc.  I have discovered that I need to wipe each disc with a soft cloth before playing it for the first time.  I don't know if it's the packaging or what.
The movies are great!!  I'm so glad that I got this collection (especially now that I know I have to wipe the discs prior to playing them).",1363219200,,332,4.15625
5018506,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I have been a Bond fan since Jr High. This is such a treat to have all the films together. The packaging is well done and classy. The quality of the movies seems good to me, although I'm not a technical person with regard to that area. Nice to have a slot for Skyfall as well in the set. Amazon's price was great on sale, as well. Here's to another 50 years of 007!",1363219200,,365,3.945945945945946
5018507,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I have only one complaint about this set and that is, they didn't put any captions on the older  movies.  That is not acceptable for a set that is this expensive.  The sound is up and down and you can't hear the dialogue.",1363219200,,221,4.093023255813954
5018508,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Very good compilation and very cheap, 23 bond films in one set, just perfect and obviosly you had to buy skyfall...",1363219200,,115,4.523809523809524
5018519,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Really enjoy these films, love the package very elegant. have it display in the open so is visible. I like that it has a reserve space for Skyfall movie.",1363219200,,153,4.310344827586207
5018520,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I have no problem with the movies to date. I have watched the first three of the series and the image looks good. It is the sound editing that irks me. The dialogue and sound effects are miss matched. If you have the volume loud enough to hear and understand the dialogue, then the sound effects and music are deafening.
It would help if the discs came with English subtitles but, at least the first three movies did not.
Which brings me to the subtitles.
I like to watch movies with the subtitles on, that way, if I miss something in the dialogue, I can pick it up from the subtitles or close captioning. But there are no English subtitles in this series, at least the first three.
The first two movies have subtitles in Spanish. OK. The third has subtitles in Mandarin, but not in Spanish.
Who was the dumb, mentally challenged idiot who designed this.
As it is, the subtitles are useful only for someone who speaks Spanish and Mandarin, but no English!
To recap, if you don't speak English or Spanish, but speak Mandarin, you can watch the third movie, Goldfinger, but not the first two. If, on the other hand, you speak Spanish, but not Mandarin, you can watch Dr. No and From Russia With Love, but not Goldfinger.
How idiotic is this?",1363132800,5,1239,4.462555066079295
5018521,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This is an excellent choice for anyone who loves Bond!!  I like the idea of an open sleeve for Skyfall, but if there are more Bonds, they will not go in this cover.
The movies are clear, sound is excellent.",1363132800,,206,4.15

5018527,5,B006U1J5ZY,Many thanks a great tribute to the genre. Let's hope it continues for another 50 years! Each actor puts his own stamp on the character - but I don't particularly like Roger Moore's interpretation.,1362700800,,196,4.794117647058823
5018528,5,B006U1J5ZY,This set is like having a part of history and they even left an empty sleeve for skyfall! My children are amazed each time they see one that they didn't even know of!,1362700800,,166,4.0606060606060606

5018532,5,B006U1J5ZY,I have always enjoyed the bond films as kind of a guilty pleasure knowing that some are great and some are crap but still enjoying them all the same. As a history major and buff it was really cool to watch all the films in order and see how the world and technologically changed over the years. The Blu Rays are fantastic especially the old movies compared to the DVD versions with color and contrast digitally tuned to try to match the original negative so you do not get overly dark and bright scenes. Almost all the artifacts that were present on the older films in VHS and DVD form were also digitally removed so you get a very clean looking picture. A little peeved it did not come with Skyfall but I did get a great price on Black Friday for $100 and it was worth it.,1362528000,,773,4.22972972972973

5018536,5,B006U1J5ZY,I bought this set for my father who is a huge James Bond fan. He loved it. The older movies look great in Blue ray and they come in a nice box set. Must have for any James Bond fan. Even comes with an extra slot for Skyfall.,1362441600,,224,3.6875
5018537,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This collection is fantastic!  The packaging is beautiful. and the movies are organized in a great way (by year of course)  There's even an empty slot for the newly-released Skyfall.

5018538,4,B006U1J5ZY,"The product was exactly what my husband wanted for his birthday and he is super excited that I got this for him he wasn't expecting it- well kindof not.  I ordered the item and waited in my in-box to remove the order information so it would be a surprise for him.  I even made sure I picked up the package from the front door so he wouldn't have any clue about what I ordered for him.  The only NEGATIVE was nothing to do with the product but with Amazon's promotional department.  Why?  Well two days before my husband's birthday we get an email saying ""You bought ""Bond 50"" you may like the following....."".  He did see that one and was happy about the gift but felt bad that the surprise was gone.  I was super annoyed and disappointed.... Thanks Amazon for screwing the surprise up..  I guess next time I will have to make a fake email up to receive all the junk emails from Amazon if I really want it to be a surprise.",1362355200,2,923,4.234285714285714
5018539,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The Blu-Ray picture quality is great and I love all of the extras.  The packaging is very nice.  I love how there are 2 books that slide into the main sleeve.  All of the disks are arranged chronologically.  There is even an extra disk space for Skyfall (for when you purchase it separately).  Classy and complete.  This was the one blu-ray purchase that I was most excited about this year.  A definite buy, especially at a $130.  Most box sets should be this complete and well-executed.  The Harry Potter and Die Hard franchises should take note and learn a thing or two from this box set.",1362182400,,590,4.490566037735849

5018544,4,B006U1J5ZY,"If you have the Bond collection on DVD, then you may not need this collection. The package is great and has a spot for Skyfall. The films look great but there is not very much that is new here. For Bond's fanatical fans, it's like the Star Wars franchise, you'll buy any editions that come out. If your not fanatical, you might just want to purchase your particular favorites and avoid the ones your not crazy about.",1361923200,,416,4.415584415584416
5018545,5,B006U1J5ZY,"If you are a Bond fan, this is the Blu-ray set you've been waiting for!

I'm not usually one to care about boxes/packaging, but case is pretty nice and I appreciate the compact packaging (versus having individual cases for each of the 22 movies on your shelf). Movies are presented in chronological order and next to each is an image of the year it was released and the Bond girl. I also appreciate the empty space in the back earmarked specifically for Skyfall (yay, another case I don't need to keep).

My one and only tiny gripe is that on the back of the box where it lists the names of the movies, it lists ""Skyfall (Coming 2013)"".

Each page comes with a photo or photos of the 2 movies that are on the right-page sleeve. A photo of the corresponding Bond girl is next to each movie.

It is quite well made and worth the money, especially considering the extremely high resolution you get when you buy a blu-ray disc instead of a conventional dvd (I was watching one of the movies and in a close-up shot you could actually see a few stray hairs on Pierce Brosnan's face that were probably missed when he was shaved - THAT is how clear the image is).

It also impressed me that it has a place for Skyfall, which we recently purchased. I have noticed some complaints about some of the earlier movies, but you can't expect them to be up to today's Blu-ray quality. They are remastered and I am not going to nit pick a film that is thirty years old. We are luck enough to be able to still have a good version of some of these earlier works, much less perfect ones.

I have had no issues with this set at all. My friends are really jealous that we have them all in one brilliant set. This is something any Bond fan should consider buying. I would highly recommend buying this while you still can. It may not be available in a few more months and the used price will be double the new price.",1361404800,,812,4.132911392405063

Great quality weather you buy the DVD or blu-ray. A great collection with a spare slot for Skyfall gives you a relief when you put the final part of the 50 year old series where it belongs. Great collection, worth owning and watching over and over again. Recomended for any James Bond fan who is looking to see those few movies he/she missed or just relive the moments again.",1361318400,,504,4.315789473684211
5018575,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Don't get the impression that all the Bond films are included in this boxed set. They *did* leave a space for Skyfall, which hadn't been released in time for inclusion. There is a cardboard disc of Skyfall, but it's not a real disk. Luckily, I had already purchased the Skyfall blu-ray disc, and I was able to side it into its place in the boxed set. No need for me to sprout superlatives of the Bond films. But I will say that the blu-ray discs give these films an added dimension with superb colors and resolution. When it comes to Bond there has always been one preference for me - Sean Connery. But I have to admit that Daniel Craig is the best Bond since, well, Bond. It's impossible to measure a 1960's era film with a 2012 film, but Daniel Craig seems to have a deeper respect for the character than anyone since Connery. For me the other actors only adequately held the Bond tradition until Craig came along. Unlike them, however, Craig doesn't just ""play"" Bond; he really IS Bond. Skyfall seems to tie it all together, with the exit and entrance of familiar characters. Sean Connery and Daniel Craig are THE standard, and everything in between were just filler, but sometimes filler will do... in blu-ray.",1361318400,4,1214,4.5479452054794525

5018591,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I just got this set with SKYFALL and I'm very happy with it.  I immediately put SKYFALL in it's holdter as soon I could.  I believe Ian Flemming would be proud to see his most beloved creation honored in this way after 50 long years of cinematic history and staying power.  It will really be a coup if ADELE gets the OSCAR for best song for SKYFALL.  That honor would, i believe, be a first for the BOND SERIES....  The bonus disc with the interviews of all the BONDS is worth atleast $50 on it's own....  I bought this boxed set for a college 5 page essay, I certainly have enough Material for it now.... That bonus disc will really give me enough material for the essay and maybe more than one.  The $129.99 is an AWESOME PRICE for such a collection of internationally beloved movies....  Bond is a guy every boy and man want to be.  Ian Flemming'd be proud to know his super spy is so honored in this way.....",1361145600,,912,4.255813953488372

All the films have been remastered and cleaned frame by frame! They look BRAND NEW! Watching the old Connery films and Moore films made me feel like I was watching them for the first time! And with the reserved space for Skyfall my Bond collection is now complete in glorious HD. A beautiful, masterful set. A must for all Bond fans!!!",1361145600,,480,4.285714285714286
5018593,5,B006U1J5ZY,"All of these movies look great, the only one I have a problem with is Goldeneye (one of my favorites) which seems to not have been treated as well and exhibits more post-processing than the rest. But besides that I am very pleased with this collection and I'm usually very nit-picky when it comes to audio and video quality...

I say this set is a must buy, but only if you can get it within an acceptable price range. For a while the prices on amazon.com where sky-rocketing (getting up to around $300), that is why I  ordered mine through Amazon.co.uk (the UK site) for about $120 shipped. Only thing was it took almost a month to get here, but definitely worth it. So if you're thinking about getting this set, don't pay more than $100 to $120 for it - if the price is too high on amazon.com then go check amazon.co.uk or wait until it goes back down because it always does.

There are only two differences between the US and UK versions:
1. Quantum of Solace is Region B coded so it will not work on most North American blu-ray players. This didn't really bother me seeing as how, in my opinion, this is the worst Bond movie.
(All other discs are Region Free meaning they will play on any player worldwide.)

and... 2. (Important to collectors) The paper that the set comes wrapped in has the ratings printed on the front (like any other movie in the UK) which kind of worried me before I ordered it. Once all plastic and paper has been removed THIS SET IS PHYSICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE AMERICAN SET, which is great since I hate having unnecessary ratings printed on my imported movies.

I hope this helps.",1361145600,,1608,4.418918918918919
5018594,5,B006U1J5ZY,"50 years and this franchise is still going strong. Amazing! The box set itself is quite good and the bonus book of posters is super sweet (not sure if that's still available, but it was when I got it). I am a fan of all that great merchandising stuff. These discs are divided into two boxes and contains some nice pull-outs that tell us what movies are in each box. The downside is, it does not list what special features are on ANY of those discs, so if you're searching for something specific, you have to put the discs in just to search for that special feature. That's a pretty major blunder there.

But, the real weak point in this box set is the ""bonus disc."" If you're a fan of this kind of stuff like me, then this review will make sense to you, but if you really just want the movies on Blu-Ray, then read no further. This box is outstanding for that alone. It even has a slot for you to place Skyfall in...kinda cool. This is why I still give it 5 stars.

So, that bonus disc. It's pretty weak. But you have probably read that in several reviews already. The features are not very long and are really just a tease more than something of real substance. Remember when you got these movies in those awesome DVD box sets and the bonus discs were crazy good. Brand new docs directed by John Cork...amazing stuff, most of which has been transferred over to this collection. But for this exclusive bonus disc, there's a featurette that has ALL the bonds called ""Being Bond."" OK, so you have all the actors who have ever played Bond in this franchise interviewed and it's not even 8 minutes long. WHAT!? And I'm OK that some of the interview footage of the actors isn't even new...some are from many years ago. Seriously, that should have been an amazing retrospective look back to all those who brought this character to life. I still scratch my head and wonder why studios release this sort of poor stuff. Don't you think a legendary character like this deserves better? I sure do. And yet, they edit all the opening movie title sequences together in one long stringout that lasts longer than an hour! Are you seeing my point here. I'd much rather watch an hour of the actors talk about ""being Bond"" than sitting through all the openings.

But whatever, studios are constantly doing lame things like this but at the same time package them in one sweet box set. The good certainly outweighs the bad here. Hopefully Skyfall's bonus features will pick up the slack where this one failed.

That said...a bangin' box set. Get it!!",1361145600,,2530,4.46969696969697

I remember my father coming home sitting down and watching the bond movies with me when i was 6. Opening this box set brought back memories.

The set itself is The complete bond set. That's about all I can say.

If you are a Bond fan and have a BluRay player you have to own this set.  If you already own the previous ""Ultimate Bond Collection"" in DVD (I do) and have a decent receiver that upscales well from 1080i to 1080p (mine is an Onkyo 5009) you would be hard put to it to see a difference in the picture.  The sound is a different matter.  The BluRay has more detail and more ""surround"" effect.  It's worth it!

I did not like having to pry the discs out of their slots in this set.  Looks great!  Takes up little room!!  But it seems easy to damage them.

The album has nice pictures, but there is a dearth of written information when compared with the DVD ""Ultimate Collection"".

I haven't looked for special features yet on the BluRays, but the DVDs have an extra disc for each movie.

5018641,5,B006U1J5ZY,50 years of Bond is an awesome addition to any collection. I highly recommend it to any movie buff and Bond fan.,1359849600,,112,4.136363636363637

If you don't have any Bond films on BD yet, this collection is worth the price.

The box also includes an empty space for the Skyfall BD, which is NOT included.",1359849600,2,382,4.352112676056338

5018645,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I am not a videophile but I am pretty picky about image quality.  I think the collection is well done on Blu-ray.  My only beef is the packaging which puts the disks between cardboard in such a manner as to make it impossible to maintain the discs in pristine condition.  Understand this is done to  minimize size/weight of packaging but I would have paid a bit more for individual disc ""traditional"" plastic packaging.  If you are a Bond fan, you will enjoy this collection.",1359849600,,475,4.607142857142857

5018651,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The Bond 50 Blu-ray collection is without a doubt, the best collection of Bond ever available to the home video consumer. Having received this for Christmas 2012, having been a Bond fan for most of my life, having worked my way through watching all the Blu-ray discs, and collected most previous versions of Bond on Home video, I can honestly say that this collection is definitive, and wonderful. There's not much else to say about it. The EON productions of Bond have been around for 50 years.

The movies have been reviewed ad nauseum, and your personal preferences as to which actor makes the best Bond aside, (the wife is partial to Daniel Craig and his sky-blue eyes) this collection will thrill you, entertain you, and satisfy your cravings for the spy who loves you. Video and audio quality are superb, and having a slot in the box for the Blu-ray of Skyfall is just icing on the cake. After waiting so long to have all 22 movies on Blu-ray, I can say with authority, that I am finally in Bond heaven.

If you are a fan of Bond, and you purchase this set, you will not be disappointed.",1359590400,3,1093,4.4874371859296485

5018654,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I've always loved the Bond films. Now the Complete Blu-Ray Set of virtually all the Bonds. Packaged good for holding 22 discs. This set I believe can sell itself to any Bond fan. You won't get all the new individual movie case covers pictures for the discs that are out now individually but those discs are exactly the same and it's amazing to fit all the films in this condensed package for taking up much less space. It even has a blank spot in the case for the new Bond Skyfall DVD which comes out in approximately 2 weeks. Inside the case you do get various pictures that are not in the individual DVD cases.  Please note that for those who do not know: A Bond rival film titled NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not included in this set because it was not an Albert Broccolli Bond film. It was actually a rival Bond Film and some other source books and fans say it was a remake of Thunderball. The film came out in 1983 at the same time as Octopussy did, so Connery and Moore were both out in the movies at the very same time. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN  was a Kevin McClory production, a Talia Shire Film, and at the time I think Warner Brothers released it. Anyway since it's not included in this set-and it's Connery as Bond, people have been wanting it and unfortunately it's currently out of print and mostly out of stock for people trying to get it to complete their Bond sets. When you look on Amazon here or even sellers from eBay sources the ones being sold are for unbelievable prices.  I'am sure it will be re-released in the near future and the price will come down to normal. One dissapointment I do have I would like the Bond DISC-MAKERS to know about:  Every Bond film on Blu-Ray is perfect picture wise-with the best menus and best extras I have ever seen. For most of the movies the sound is great too, but I have noticed this before this set came out: I did an audio comparison of THUNDERBALL: The 2006 MGM Ultimate Edition first remastered Lowery film restored Thunderball standard DVD audio version versus the audio playback of the first remastered Lowery film restored BLU-RAY DISC that was in the Metal BLU-RAY Case also from 2006-those first releases. I notice that the voices on the BLU-RAY VERSION are much lower where the sound effects blow you out of your chair especially during that opening pre-credit fight sequence. You have to turn it up quite a bit at the beginning of THUNDERBALL BLU-RAY to hear what Bond and the girl are talking about and when Bond's first fist hit comes with the music it's so loud  you jump to turn it down. When you play the STANDARD Thunderball it is the same film remastered by Lowery but the sound is perfectly balanced where this does not happen. It sounds better actually because it's balanced and you don't have to make any adjustments. The talking aspects are much more distinct and full throughout the entire standard disc and I even hear more background sounds on this Standard Disc versus the BLU RAY Thunderball. I'am going by the first Lowery remastered released Thunderball set Ultimate Edition 2006 MGM 2-disc set which has the louder & more distinct talking vocals which was sold separately or found in Volume 2 out of the 4 James Bond Ultimate Edition Sets. In these volume sets the cases were slimlined cases, the cover art was designed black-boarded with Connery holding a speargun and the single sold 2-disc Ultimate Edition set had the same covers but all were not slimlined cases. I don't know if the new 2013 standard is the same or not, but you will notice the audio difference on the Black-bordered 2006 Lowery Standard Edition 2-disc set. I have not noticed any other Bond film with this audio problem. All other BLU-RAY versions are perfect or near exact audio wise to their standard Lowery DVD remastered counterparts. This new 2013 BLU-RAY entire set still has the overloud audio on the sound effects versus the lower talking audios on the current 2013 Thunderball-Blu-Ray in this new set. So I hope the BOND DISC-MAKERS READ THIS TO FIX FUTURE PRINTS OF THUNDERBALL AUDIO BLU-RAY. Check it out if you don't believe me. It's not an equipment setting- and it does not matter if your playing your audio 5.1 or 7.1 or no matter how you try to adjust your sound on your equipment-- it's the way the disc audio is balanced , remixed and encoded on the BLU-RAY.  Still I give this set 5 stars for what you actually get is great: well packaged, complete, great menus, great picture quality, and all in one box.",1359504000,2,4478,4.5427509293680295

5018752,4,B006U1J5ZY,"This is a great collection of films for lovers of James Bond.  Having them all on Blu-Ray is wonderful.  I was lucky enough to purchase the collection when it was specially priced at $99.  It is now $299 for the same item.  I would definitely would have to think a bit harder about shelling out $300 vs $100 for the same item.  But if you really love Bond this is a great opportunity to get them all together in one collection.  The packaging is really great.  It is in two separate books and the DVDs each have a sort of envelope in the book that makes them easy to take out and easy to put away.  It is unique to most DVD sets I have purchased.  It makes it much easier to just put them neatly away when you have watched them.  And they have a blank spot in the second book for Skyfall.  Which is kind of ingenious because it kind of encourages you to go ahead and pre-order it so you will have the entire collection (which I did, especially after seeing the movie in the theater).  Like another reviewer said... if you are even thinking about ordering this, you know what you are getting more or less - but the quality is terrific and it is a perfect collection for the 50th year!",1358208000,,1183,4.185840707964601

5018755,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I loved this collection. It came relatively quickly, even though I purchased near the holidays.

If you can acquire this set at a good price, it is very well worth it if you have not built up your Bond collection already.  Being a fan of Bond movies does not hurt either.  Recommended",1357344000,,332,3.984848484848485
5018906,5,B006U1J5ZY,"All of the oldest Bond films that I have watched out of this so far (I am about to start in on the Roger Moore years) have been restored beautifully from the original film negatives in a way that brings a new experience to any Bond fan with an HDTV.

The packaging is nice, but surprisingly space efficient considering how many discs it contains (unlike some collector's sets that may need an entire shelf of their own).

The special features are one of the most interesting aspects of this package. Each movie (that I have watched so far) has a number of specials regarding that particular movie (or the Bond series as a whole) that actually aired around the time the movie originally came out, along with some other special features from more recent years. This is something that I am not used to seeing in Blu-ray and DVD releases of older movies, and is much appreciated.

The art on the discs themselves and the menus on each movie all have the same template, which makes it feel much more like a collector's set than if they had just taken individual releases and thrown them together in the same box. I can only hope that the release of Skyfall follows the same template since they left a space for it. The disc menus are also simple and quick, without a bunch of annoying gimmicks; just your typical ""clicky"" noise when you select an item.

Overall, this is definitely a quality product and the current definitive set of Bond films. I am glad that I had not previously purchased any of them on Blu-ray and have not regretted this purchase for even a second. It will be a part of my movie collection for quite some time - at least until the next big physical media format comes along with a more updated Bond collection.",1357344000,,1727,4.490445859872612

The only complaint I would propose is the fact that the cardboard holding the discs will see some wear and tear with frequent viewings of each film. The discs are not that easy to get out and get back in. Other than that very minor issue, I took the set for what it is: a journey through the amazing history of one of the greatest characters to ever be portrayed on the silver screen.",1357257600,,557,4.1192660550458715

There is also a empty space for when skyfall comes out to include it with the collection!

The handling of the disks is not easy, mainly taking it out of the holder.",1356739200,,104,4.25
5019021,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Good collection.  Not a huge Bond fan but needed something for the Blu-ray and the $100 Black Friday week Lightning Deal was too good to pass up.

Case feels like it belong on a bookshelf.  Movies look great.

For full price it is probably lacking a few extra goodies.",1356739200,,268,4.408163265306122

5019037,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I have always loved the Bond movies for many reasons, as any enthusiast will tell you. Being like him is every man's goal and being with him is every woman's. (Or so it seems in the movies) This set is an excellent way to purchase all of the movies from throughout the last half-century, and also takes up far less space than owning all of them individually. Definitely worth buying!",1356739200,,383,4.485714285714286
5019038,4,B006U1J5ZY,"The video quality is excellent. The scenes are beautiful and makes me wish more movies would return to this style of videography.  The sound is another issue.....loud soft loud soft, I constantly had to adjust the volume to hear it or keep from being blown out of my chair by it.",1356652800,,279,4.470588235294118

I was expecting more from a collectors version (a booklet at least), but overall, it is a nice and great item to have.",1356652800,,306,4.116666666666666
5019042,5,B006U1J5ZY,I had read some reviews that the quality of the blue-ray on the older movies wasn't that good. I thought it was great. I love that all the movies are in one set. They are arranged very nicely in the case. There are so many bonus features that tell some of what went on while filming these movies. I have been a bond fan for a long time and love this set.,1356652800,,354,3.9305555555555554
5019063,4,B006U1J5ZY,Great set... it will make you laugh at what we thought were the best car chases and gizmos of that time. Great entertainment!  The later Bond movies are still worth the time to enjoy! The first 4 movies reminds you of Sean Connery's best role!,1356652800,,243,4.4
5019064,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I bought this item based on the fact that Amazon indicates there is french subtitles on the movies. Unfortunately, most of the movies didn't. I am very very disapointed.",1356652800,,169,4.862068965517241
5019065,4,B006U1J5ZY,This is a perfect gift for a Bond movie lover. Comes with two book style inserts that have pictures from the film as well as the disc.

5019066,5,B006U1J5ZY,If you are one of the many Bond fans you need to have this.  The complete collection on blu-ray.  Just watched a few of the earlier films and it was amazing.

5019084,5,B006U1J5ZY,I purchased this for my husband who is a big Bond fan. It comes beautifully presented in a book format. It covers most movies. The only issue I had (and this is not a disk problem) but I had trouble finding a blu ray player to play them in Australia.,1356566400,,250,4.02
5019085,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Husband was pleasantly surprised to receive this on Christmas, since Bond is one of his favorite characters to watch. Would definitely recommend to someone who was looking for this type of collection.",1356566400,,200,5.28125
5019086,4,B006U1J5ZY,"The person who I gave this gift to LOVED IT!!! We are big James Bond fans and the is definitely a collectors item. The only negative critique I have is that the Bond cover package didn't hold very well. The glue wasn't strong enough to bind the edges of the cover, we had to use crazy glue.",1356566400,,290,4.105263157894737
5019087,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Must have for ANY Bond fan. Beautiful case, interesting bonus disk and an extra slot for Skyfall.

Simple review for a wonderful product.",1356566400,,137,4.956521739130435
5019088,5,B006U1J5ZY,This was the best gift idea for Christmas.  My husband is a Bond fanatic and to find the whole collection was the best thing i could find.  It has all the movies that i couldn't find and some that he already had so it was perfect.,1356566400,,230,3.9782608695652173

5019090,5,B006U1J5ZY,I bought the Bond 50 for my husband and he loves it! The movies are in order in the case which has two book- like holders for all the movies. Each movie has the Bond girl from the movie next to the disc. This is great for us because it doesn't take up a bunch of space on the shelf. If you are looking for just the movies this is a great easy way to have them all together in one package.,1356566400,,388,3.7439024390243905

5019102,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I won't bother to review the Bond movies as a category; I think they are great but by this point everyone should be familiar with them.

In general, the quality of the movies in HD seems to be quite good and the price for a collection of 22 films of this quality can't be beat. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with was the bonus material, which seems a bit thin for a film series of this caliber (hence the four-star rating). I was hoping for some more in-depth interviews or ""behind the scenes"" types of footage. While some of this material is offered, most of the bonus disk is taken up with intro sequences, songs, and short bits.

Still, a great value for anyone who doesn't own the films already or who wants to upgrade to Bluray.",1356566400,,751,4.319148936170213
5019103,5,B006U1J5ZY,All I was expecting. This a must have for any Bond fan. Why is there a minimum number of words?,1356566400,,95,3.8

5019105,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I actually bought this as a Christmas present for a very dear friend. He hadn't seen all of the Bond films -, but had enjoyed ""Skyfall."" So I thought this might make an appropriate way for me to thank him for the many favours he had done me over the years.  He was pleased to receive it and intends to view this mammoth collection of films in their proper chronological order.

So this is one Christmas gift that will continue to be enjoyed long after New Year's Day. Also, there is a special place in this box to add ""Skyfall "" when it's released.  And if that isn't good packaging , I don't know what is.",1356566400,,606,4.206896551724138
5019106,5,B006U1J5ZY,All of the bond movies in one organized place.  The movies look great redone in blu ray quality. Would highly recommend,1356566400,,119,4.666666666666667
5019107,4,B006U1J5ZY,Amazing package . . . with one flaw.  The sound in one of the CD's is flawed.  I would highly recommend this collection.,1356566400,,120,4.173913043478261
5019108,4,B006U1J5ZY,"If your are really a Bond fan you will consider to have it on your shelf, even may be there are a few movie duplications in your collection. That's the inevitable thing for fans like us. Nothing much you can do about it. One thing you can do though, get it when the price is right for you.",1356566400,,289,4.0
5019109,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I owned most of the Bond movies in a series of Special Edition Box Sets issued in the early 2000's.  I decided to upgrade to Blu-Ray when this set became available for a good price.  Includes all the bonus material in my old sets plus some new stuff.  Only minor complaint is the Quantum of Solace disk doesn't have the same menu style as the rest of the disks, so it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the set.",1356566400,,416,4.048780487804878
5019110,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Very beautiful and nice presentation ;it is like a book.ilustrated by
great pictures.
the bonus cd is interesting and great",1356566400,,123,5.2
5019111,4,B006U1J5ZY,"The movies you know well, so let's talk about the packaging. It's an attractive way to present them, but the only way to get the discs out is to grab the edge of the disc between forefinger and thumb - that's not ideal. So far I have gotten a smudge on every disc as I've gotten it out. Fortunately, Bluray discs are armoured, so it's easy to wipe them clean.

If, however, you watch movies while eating pizza, you might find this packaging quite inconvenient.",1356566400,,460,4.411764705882353
5019122,5,B006U1J5ZY,Superb video quality. I was worried I wouldn't enjoy the older films but they were fantastic. Sean Connery was soooo sexy!,1356480000,,122,4.857142857142857

5019124,4,B006U1J5ZY,Good set and great value for money as I picked the set for $99 during one of Amazon's Gold box deals. The hardbook itself could have been better as it is currently just a holder for the discs (with a photo from each film been the only contribution). Would have been nice if it contained more text related to each film. Anyway happy with my purchase.,1356480000,,349,4.303030303030303
5019125,5,B006U1J5ZY,"My wife has been a bond fan since we saw the first one together.  Haven't missed one since.  I got her this for Christmas and she thinks it was one of the best presents I've given her yet.  The remastered quality is sharp, clear, and enhanced.  The sound is tremendous.  Can't seem to get her to cook any more as now every night is a ""Bond Night"".",1356480000,,347,4.119402985074627

5019129,5,B006U1J5ZY,Few heros touch the long lasting appeal of James Bond who continues to reincarnate despite films and Bonds which should hve killed him.,1356480000,,135,4.913043478260869
5019130,5,B006U1J5ZY,Love the fact that it has the last slot for Skyfall!  This gift was very well appreciated. Great pricing too!,1356480000,,109,4.45
5019131,5,B006U1J5ZY,Pretty good movies. I bought this as a gift and I was amazed by the quality of the discs. Very nice packaging.,1356480000,,110,4.045454545454546
5019132,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great set, but I don't like the design-these tight pockets tend to tear. And I know it's unreasonable, but I wish they could have included the single Warner Brothers Bond film, Never Say Never Again. Other than that, this is first class.",1356480000,,267,4.469387755102041
5019133,5,B006U1J5ZY,James Bond all the way.  Packaging is super.  fit's nicely with my dvd collection.  that is about all I can say,1356480000,,111,4.190476190476191

5019135,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Not much for reviews, but a huge Bond fan. Over the years I have purchased all the Bond collections 3 or 4 times. VHS, DVD twice and now the Blu's.  The picture is clearer, and with less artifacts than my Bond Ultimate Edition DVD's, although less so with some of the older titles.  I really like the packaging, and it presents well on my shelf. The fore-thought of leaving a blank space for Skyfall is also greatly appreciated.  I managed to get mine on sale for less than a hundred dollars, so excellent value, less than $5 a title. This helped convince me that the upgrade from the ultimate editions was worth it (my ultimate edition dvd's were $75 each for 4 boxes = $300).  If you are a new fan of Bond or just starting your collection this is an excellent start. If you have the ultimate editions its hit or miss on the upgrade aspect, although I would consider the packaging and improvement in picture quality a worthwhile investment if you aren't replacing all the movies. Overall an excellent presentation and a good value.",1356480000,,1032,4.532258064516129

5019149,5,B006U1J5ZY,I have watched two of the 22 movies. Both were of high quality.  Casino Royale is a very good movie - one of the best Bonds.  Moonraker is not a very good movie (one of the worst Bonds0 but the quality of the blu-ray was high.,1356480000,,226,3.891304347826087

Sleek looking collection in two booklets with pictures. Best part..the remastered older films.  We have watched a few already as he only had his birthday four days ago.
Like the idea of the fake DVD in the last page for when Skyfall is released. Highly recommend.",1356480000,,440,4.407407407407407

The older movies still look old but you can't expect a perfect transfer and the movies to suddenly look like a new film that was filmed with better equipment. However, the restoration looks fantastic. The case is perfect. I love the layout with the year and Bond girl next to each movie. I got this for a killer deal, but I would consider paying full price for it too. It's a great set!",1356480000,,452,4.329411764705882
5019183,5,B006U1J5ZY,"For the price, this was a steal. It was great to go back and see all of the old bond films in chronological order. It gives you a real flavor for the progression of the character. My kids got a real kick out of them too",1356480000,,219,3.782608695652174
5019184,1,B006U1J5ZY,"The item was promoted as discounted and I bought it for around 100$. Evan this price is too much. Case is good, but this 2 ""books"" is very simple. Only pictures and paper pockets for BlueRay discs. No print materials, no texts, nothing else.",1356480000,7,241,4.5

These movies now sell for $299.  The lower price was the Amazon deal of the day the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  I am a HUGE Bond fan and have always wanted an all-inclusive box set and now I have it.  The set is nothing short of gorgeous and very fitting for a 50th Anniversary set.  It is true that the discs are somewhat diffucult to remove, but this should not detract from the value and enjoyment of the set.  I think the trick is to lift the edge with your thumb and then push on the center of the disc with your index finger.  Haven't had time to watch any of the movies yet(I have seen them all before).  I am glad MGM got a deal with FOX for video distribution through 2016 so they could release this just in time for Bond's golden anniversary.  I am very much looking forward to watching each and every movie.",1356480000,,966,4.145161290322581

5019189,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I got this for $100 when Amazon.com was doing a sale, and that's about as cheap as it's gonna get, folks. I calculated it - that's around $4.60 per blue ray disc/movie.  If you can't get it for that price, I highly suggest you go to a certain warehouse that starts with the capital C and get it for about $150 if it's still there.  The problem is, you won't have the gorgeous books these come in.

SO GLAD I got this for my husband for Christmas 2012!!!",1356480000,,453,4.125

5019199,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This maybe one of the greatest boxsets of all time. I cannot state enough how much I love the packaging!  Each movie is placed in a nifty page within 2 hard back cover books. It has all of the ""official Bond"" films and the book even has a spot for Skyfall when it's released on bluray.  The movies all looked fantastic and sounded great as well. This is for the ultimate fan, it's pricey yes but well worth it if you have the means ...and a girlfriend who's not looking at your receipts!

The presentation of the product is quite lovely - classic colors, all Bonds present on the cover, high quality, two books of Blu-rays/DVDs inside dividing the years.

The graphics and sound quality are fantastic, even with the older movies. They obviously did a really good job cleaning up the old film removing artifacts/graininess, improving the sound, etc. Some of the less-good transfers from old film to Blu-ray still have issues with certain scenes being grainy, sound will be a little staticy, even volume will change. I haven't watched all 22 films yet, but the ones I have watched have none of these problems.",1356220800,,634,4.660714285714286

5019206,5,B006U1J5ZY,"For the price that I purchased it (around 140 dollars) the Blu-ray set was a bargain, at around 6 bucks a disc.  The movies themselves are hit or miss, however; some of them may be too campy or cheesy for some audiences to really enjoy, and the action scenes for the earlier movies will be incredibly underwhelming for those that are accustomed to today's movie standards.  With that said however, there is plenty to enjoy from these movies; beautiful women, handsome secret agents, and breathtaking landscapes, all captured in ""High-Definition""(sortof).  The extras are somewhat interesting, but nothing to write home about.  The discs are a bit of a hassle to take out of the sleeves if you don't like to scratch, bend, or damage the sleeves (for reference, I don't even like to put fingerprints on glossy surfaces, so these sleeves bothered me slightly).  Anyway, to get to the heart of the matter: Do you like Bond?  Buy this if you have the budget.  Don't really like Bond?  Probably would be best to just buy the individual discs that you enjoy watching.",1356220800,,1060,4.785714285714286
5019207,5,B006U1J5ZY,Christmas gift to husband. Just what he wanted. Wonderful. Also ordered Skyfall to complete the collection. Donated the videos of Bond to the Library.,1356220800,,150,5.291666666666667
5019208,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I grew up watching these films on video borrowed from our local library. Inspite of all the re-runs and marathons on satellite TV, I hadn't seen most of these in years. I'll have to say that in retrospect, these films have stood the test of time. Aside from one really horrible CGI scene in ""Die Another Day"" (and that equally horrible theme song), I'd rate this the best collection of films ever.

The one drawback to this set is that all the discs have the same menu and there are no previews until you get to ""Quantum of Solace"", which appears to be the standard Blu-ray issue. Not sure why they didn't redo it for this collection (well I am not suprised from a finance standpoint, but from a design standpoint, I don't get it at all), but I found it broke the branding of the rest of the set. The extras are kind of plain. I was expecting more out of the Bond actor interviews but the segment flew by in about 5 minutes. In any case, I'd certainly recommend this set to anyone who doesn't already own more than two of the previous films, but if you do, there's not much else to draw you in to buy unless you're just trying to complete your collection.",1356220800,,1155,4.298165137614679

5019217,5,B006U1J5ZY,"If you are a fan of James Bond, this is a great collection to own.  These include all ""official"" movies made by Eon Productions up through Quantum of Solace.  While Skyfall is not included, there is a space for the disc to be housed when it comes out on DVD.  The whole set is like a coffee table book, which I love.  Each movie has a Bond girl from the movie by the disc slot.  The special features on making the movies are great as well (if you are into that sort of thing, which I am).

Overall I love the set.  I only have two issues:
1) On the DVD menu, to start the movie you must select ""Initiate Mission"".  It's cute, but when I first popped a disc in, took me a few minutes to figure out which option started the movie.  Just a ""play"" option would have been fine.
2) the slots the discs are held in aren't very
good and have no padding. As the whole thing is made of cardboard, you have to be careful taking out the discs to ensure they do not scratch.",1355961600,,961,4.015789473684211

It's interesting to me to watch the evolution of the world's greatest secret agent both in style, mannerisms and gadgets.  All your 007's are here for your viewing pleasure (seems everyone has a favorite) from 60's chic Sean Connery to 70's mainstay Roger Moore and of course Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and the incomparable Daniel Craig. Please do not discount George Lazenby's sole effort in the series!

I greatly enjoy watching my favorite films and seeing details I've never seen before. Also, there is a little golden nugget in this box set. A slot has been reserved for Skyfall because it was released in 2012. This makes the box set totally complete unless you count the film ""Never say Never Again"" [...] as part of the Bond collection. Never say Never was released after Sean said he would never act in a Bond film again. Well, he did, but in keeping his integrity they did not make it one of the bond films. If you want this film, you will have to order it separate.

5019228,4,B006U1J5ZY,"As a set to honor Bond for 50 years its not bad. Some of the film transfers look better than others, but the bonus disc is a joke. I think it was under an hour of new material. Seeing that Sony, MGM and Fox worked together on this we could have had additional extras like the 50's TV version of Casino Royal included, or even the two unofficial Bond films. The 67 Casino Royal and 84's Never Say Never Again.

The extras for the Brosnan films is pretty slight, most of the extras from the first issue of Die Another Day are not included.",1355702400,,537,4.163461538461538

5019240,4,B006U1J5ZY,We all know these movies to this is not at all about the movies. Some of the blu rays have commercials (the newer ones it seems) that you are forced to watch. This is absurd. I have the old special edition DVDs and there were no preview ads at all. This infuriates me. Now for the real reason this set is not a 5 star. The audio track is only DTS-Master Audio 5.1. I have a 7.1 system and this is what blu ray was made for. I understand the older movies being 5.1 but not Casino Royal or QoS. Those should really be 7.1. The picture quality on the movies is excellent to the point where you see how cheesy the old movies are for the actions and stunts. Its very laughable but I do not care. I love these movies.

5019243,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I recently purchased two James Bond blu-ray DVDs, From Russia with Love and Diamonds Are Forever. Having owned them and the rest of the series from over a decade ago I was looking forward to the HD quality and the extras that are added to each film. The quality on both films is superb and the Inside From Russia with Love documentary as well as the Harry Saltzman Showman documentary have both been reformatted for the 16x9 screen. However, I have a major complaint when it comes to the Inside Diamonds Are Forever documentary. Here MGM has cut corners and has left the original 4x3 version on the new blu-rays. To compensate one must change the ratio format on their TV in order to enjoy the video or if you don't know how to make that adjustment then you are left to watching a 16x9 video play out on a 4x3 format on a 16x9 TV. In other words it is like watching something through the wrong end of a telescope. Even if you do make the physical adjustment on your TV the ratio is not correct and you will have oblong heads and faces. Sadly, about a 3rd of the James Bond documentaries were not reformatted and/or reedited to the 16x9 ratio. They are You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Octopussy, A View to a Kill and The Living Daylights.  I'm not too sure about The Man with the Golden Gun and Moonraker but people are paying for inferior quality in the extras department.  Since it is too late to do anything about it for this release, MGM might fix the problem in another 10 years when they introduce the 60 years of OO7 on DVD or whatever the format will be in 2022. In the meantime, buyer beware.",1355356800,2,1666,4.353697749196141
5019244,5,B006U1J5ZY,"If you have seen Skyfall, then you must sit through the last 20 or so films previously released. I bought Bond 50 in anticipation of Skyfall, and Skyfall truly made me appreciate how the series was going back to its original roots of being true to Ian Fleming's vision.

The picture quality is superb, especially on some of the older films and it really is a treat to see Sean Connery eradicating evil on Blu-Ray.

The presentation is awesome with a beautiful box set and the Blu-Ray discs neatly packed inside.

The bonus features are icing on the cake, but let's be honest, everybody who buys this, wants the films preserved on blu-ray. So from that perspective, Bond aficionado get exactly what they bargained for!",1355356800,,717,4.72

5019247,3,B006U1J5ZY,"Where to begin?

The ""complete"" collection lacks ""Never Say Never Again"" and the original ""Casino Royale"" for reasons discussed at length in other reviews.

""Dr. No"" had inconsistent audio.  Volume had to be doubled after a point to maintain the sound level, and portions had an echoing quality which may or may not be attributable to the original film.

The packaging, while pretty, is flimsy and ill-designed in a way that makes the discs difficult to remove without damaging the packaging and/or discs.

Three of the discs have been nonstarters (""Diamonds are Forever,"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" and ""View to a Kill"").  No amount of coaxing would prompt them to work.

While we have checked all discs to ensure they at least start (two requiring multiple attempts to get them to play--""Moonraker"" and ""Goldeneye""), we have only viewed the first six (chronologically) in their entirety, so there may or may not be more issues on other discs.

The pricing is irrationally high in relation to the quality of the product, especially considering the films that are defective or are simply not included.

Otherwise, this is a serviceable, if unimpressive, set so far.

Where this set does seem to shine is in the abundance of nice extra content to choose from.",1355356800,,1255,4.9052132701421804

5019251,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Well, here it is. Took a double dip but well worth it. The Ultimate Bond collection was damn good and had plenty of extras to boot. A step up from the M-G-M special editions with a bump up to DTS.

But we're not here to talk about past efforts, we're here for the Blu-rays. This is about as good as it's going to get. They did restore from the original negatives but I'm not sure if it was for the previous set or this. There is a difference as the the movies are very clear and the detail is really sharp. Just sampled Dr. No, Thunderball and You Only Live Twice. The color seems more true and not as red as the DVDs. The DTS is also much deeper on the later movies too.

Most of the extras seem to have ported over with a few more per disc. However, if you like extras do not trade in you old set, there are some missing from this new set. The discs are house in nice book style covers, in a slip case, that fit better on my shelf than the behemoth DVD set.

If you've read my other reviews you know I always have some gripe to toss out. Some are just personal preferences but, this one is pretty significant. Besides the bump up in video and audio an extra bonus disc has been added. All listings mention the content and it sounds pretty good. Far from it. Everything is between 1 and 4 minutes except for the the Skyfall blogs, which clocked in just over 10 minutes.  The only significant feature is Designing 007 - 50 Years of Bond Style, coming in just over 4 minutes. It's about an exhibition at the Barbican of Bond designs from the beginning. it includes storyboards, set design, set models, all the costumes, all the props, very tiny comments from Ken Adam and Peter Lamont. I would have rather seen more of this than the title sequences, all in a row, that took over an hour.

DVD Beaver broke down the time on the bonus disc and it comes in at a whopping 92 minutes (that's sarcasm). Dr. No was longer than that! To waste a blu-ray with this meager content is really uncalled for. These could have been spread out to the other discs.

Honestly I really despair when I think about how much effort was put into this whole set and what could have been mined for the bonus disc.

Still do highly recommend this set. Like I said, don't get rid of your Ultimate Bond, it has extras you might want to see. Also it's fetching up to $500 these days as it is Out Of Print.

Also, sorry Amazon,  got this at Best Buy Black friday week for $129.",1355270400,,2445,4.185106382978724

5019258,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I love the 007 films, especially the early ones with Sean Connery. That is why I am so taken aback with the price of this paticular item.

Why so pricey? $295? It isn't even Blu - Ray! I could understand this kind of price tag on a Blu - Ray set, but not a DVD set. Especially a set with ABSOLUTELY NO EXTRAS. Even the nortoriously overpriced SMALLVILLE DVD Set had a boatload of extras. BTW, both of these sets can be found on Ebay, Target, and just about anywhere else for a far more reasonable price, starting as low as $125.

But I digress. I am here to review the Bond 50 DVD Set. My advice to any serious Bond collector, or just the casual viewer is to get the DVD set, if you can find it. Some movies, due to age, low technical standards, (Such as the case with the Smallville Set- wich WB says it will never release on Blu - Ray due to that fact)
and other factors, will never lend themselves to a Blu - Ray Upgrade. Such is the case with most of the really great classic Bond films.  They look absolutely brilliant on DVD, yet would probably look absolutely horrid on Blu - Ray.

Fortunately, some movie companies are beginning to understand this, and are rethinking thier release stratagies. Yes, newer films look absolutely stunning on Blu - Ray. However, some older movies look just as stunning on DVD, and quite often, even better. So, my advice is twofold: Get the DVD version of this set, and find a much cheaper place to get it. You won't be sorry.",1355270400,,1464,4.293478260869565
5019259,4,B006U1J5ZY,"A very nice set for Bond fans but the packaging and presentation could be a little better. For a 50th anniversary edition it's not great.

The films look great on Blu-Ray though!!",1355270400,,179,4.59375
5019260,5,B006U1J5ZY,"From the start, MGM has generally done an excellent job with their releases of the James Bond franchise.  From the original ""Special Edition"" releases back in 1999 and 2000, to the two disc ""Ultimate Editions"" released around 2006, to the first wave of Blurays, the subsequent releases all reflect an improvement in image quality, and bonus content.

The comprehensive Bond 50 Bluray set, clearly isn't for everyone, and poses some questions to those who may already have some of the Blurays.  Being a Bond fan for over forty years, I own the first 22 Bond films, some as many as three times (SE, Ultimate, and Bluray).  Even so, I knew that at some point, I would eventually get the Bond 50 Bluray set.  It was just a matter of waiting for a favorable price, and that fateful day came when the set dropped to $99.99 as Amazon's Deal of the Day.  I say ""fateful"", because since that day, the availability of the set at Amazon has been rather spotty, and the price has soared to over $300.

While I haven't viewed all the films on Bluray, the image quality of the ones I have seen is generally impressive, particularly for many of those new to Bluray.  You Only Live Twice, and The Living Daylights look impeccable, with Goldeneye not far behind.  On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever, Octopussy, and A View To A Kill, all look quite good.  The image quality of The Spy Who Loved Me, seems to improve as the film progresses.  The Man With The Golden Gun, and Tomorrow Never Dies, both seem a bit drab in comparison to the rest.

The Bond Blurays do take a while to load, and the menu is a variation of the same familiar format from the Ultimate Editions.  I haven't done a complete inventory for each movie, but not all of the bonus materials from the Ultimate Editions have migrated to the Blurays, although when possible it appears that the bonus materials have been upgraded to HD.  So while the Bond 50 set wraps up my collection of MGM's Bond releases for the moment, it seems I'll still have to retain my Ultimate Edition bonus discs.

The 23rd ""Bonus Disc"" is a big disappointment, featuring a number of compilations pieces, such as one with all 22 title sequences strung together, but with very little actual new content save for a few short featurettes, and publicity pieces for Skyfall.  For the celebratory package that this release was intended to be, it's a very lackluster effort.

The films are housed in a 11"" long rectangular box, which contains two booklets with thick cardboard pages.  Each booklet is designed to house 12 discs, with a space reserved for the latest Bond entry Skyfall (2012).  Adorned with photos, the presentation is certainly attractive, but removing and inserting the discs into the designated ""pockets"", isn't very convenient, and will probably result in some damage over time.  The slick black cover very easily collects fingerprint smudges.  While not the greatest design, it's not enough to deduct any stars from what is nearly the ultimate Bond collection available at this time.

The release of this set was coordinated with the theatrical release of Skyfall, and the Christmas holidays.  The approach seems to have worked well in promoting sales, as the set often seems to be in short supply, and the price has been fluctuating widely.  It may be some time, before things settle down and reason prevails in that regard.",1355270400,,3382,4.741880341880342

5019268,5,B006U1J5ZY,"It's quite a feat to have any property be around for 50 years, especially one that's been riddled with financial woes like Bond has. Nevertheless, this set contains some of my favorite action movies and is something any action, spy, or Bond fond would be happy to own. I won't take up any space reviewing the individual movies that come in the set (as that would take up way too much space) but the actual set itself.

Within the set, the movies are housed in two separate booklets, labeled 1962-1981 and 1983-2012. The 22-disc set is built out of a glossy cardboard, and each disc is housed in a sleeve that contains artwork and images from the film it belongs to. It's a treat to flip through the pages and see each movies represented. There's even an empty slot at the back of the second booklet to house Skyfall when it comes out. The set isn't totally complete, as it doesn't include the movies from the Eon production line, including the original Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again.

The movies themselves look terrific with the Bluray treatment. As you can imagine, images and sounds are much clearer and it's been a lot of fun to go back and rewatch the movies in high definition. Each movie has various special features, culminating in literally hundreds of hours of extras.

As I said, this set will be sure to please action, spy, or Bond fans. The price tag can be a little daunting, but I've seen Amazon's promotional prices range anywhere from $100 to $200. Trust me, you won't be disappointed with your purchase.",1355097600,,1531,4.6007326007326

About the only complaint I can think that some people might have is due to the packaging, if you like having all your movies neatly arranged this isn't going to work as well due to its size being more than twice as deep as a standard DVD case and about 60% of the height.

There are much more in-depth reviews of picture quality which you can read here, but I will say a word about the packaging.  I'm not sure it's the most efficient way to package (two 'books' inside a larger case), but there probably isn't an easy way to package 23 discs that would make everyone happy.

5019276,3,B006U1J5ZY,"The films are great! The James Bond series is the hallmark of the spy film genre! I'm replacing my standard definition DVD Bond film collection with this one on Blu-Ray. I DON'T like the way the DVDs are packaged. There are two book binders...divided into the films made from 1962 through 1981 and from 1983 through 2012 (Skyfall, which will be released 1Q 2013). The DVDs are stored, two each, in an envelope type configuration.  I would MUCH prefer, at a minimum, jewel cases, because they protect the DVD better and are easier to remove and replace the DVD. And they will fit on my shelf better too! The book binders are wide and won't fit on my narrow DVD shelf properly. If you love the James Bond films, as I do, and you have the proper shelf space and don't mind pinching the edge of the DVD to remove it from an envelope-like storage medium, then definitely make the investment and buy this collection.

The set is nice but I don't feel they really did that great of a lob on the transfer and because of the packaging there is no way to get the disc out with out touching it. I've had a couple freeze up and had to clean them to get them to play. They were actually kind of stuck to the packaging slot they store in. Maybe to keep them from slidding around during shipping???  The packaging does suck but is very nice looking. Storing it with your other videos presents another issue if you like to be organized. Very awkward design.  Pretty sure Q didn't design this set.
 Hope I don't have any other problems with the rest that I haven't watched.  This product deserved to be presented in a more fitting fashion for 50 years of bond. I had a couple of the single discs and these are the exact same as those.  They did nothing to make them any better (and they could have used some improvement).  In all I had all 22 movies in the latest dvd upgrade and these really are not that much of an improvement but they are better.  The special features??? really don't feature anything new.
Unless you just gotta have it in blueray then buy it but wait for the price to go back down after the holidays.  Personally I could have lived with the latest digital upgraded dvd set and been wiser for it and $177.00 richer.  but I'm a bond nut what can I say.",1354752000,3,1492,4.236749116607774

Lets put George and Timothy off to the side in a different color, because I guess they don't count?

And the interior shots - they colorize black and white shots, sometimes poorly, and colorize already color shots incorrectly.  Bianchi's nightgown is blue - but they make it pink! D'abo's dress from the press conference is blue - but they make it red!

They reverse some shots of Roger Moore (his mole is on the wrong side) and it is all the more jarring because they make it in a collage with other pictures that aren't flipped - so it looks like Roger has multiple moles.

Graphics and package designs are elegant and sophisticated. The only thing I regret is that after such a notable effort of putting this collection together and going through a large list of details, how come the menu design of Quantum does not match the rest of the collection? It was only one title and because of that I cant say that the collection is flawless.
I hope the producers release a version of the Skyfall blu-ray specially packed to fit the content of this collection, so the slot designed for it will be used. Savings could be done in packaging too.",1354492800,,824,4.574324324324325

5019297,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The blu-ray box edition of the Bond films can't be beat.  Anyone who even likes, let alone loves the Bond films, are in for a treat, especially if one has a nice home theatre system...wide screen, surrond speakers and a top notch blu-ray player.  As for the films themselves, there isn't a loser in the bunch.  While some are obviously better than others, they all have some wonderful qualities, be it story, actors, sound, theme music, scenery...or all of the above.  No sense giving run down of plots, but I DO have my favorite Bonds and titles after viewing the entire collection!!!
My favorite Bond is....are you ready for this?  Yes, ROGER MOORE.  He brings something that no onther actor does to the character.  Sure, he's a bit tongue-in-cheek and times, but that's what makes his portrayal so wonderful.  His best is FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Worse MOONRAKER
Second favorite Bond is Sean...He's the orginal, if you don't count the TV version...and excelent as Bond.  His best; GOLDFINGER; FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. His worse: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.
Third best: Pierce Brosnan.  More like Sean, but a glimmer of Roger and just the right age.  His best: GOLDENEYE; WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH.  Worse: DIE ANOTHER DAY
Fourth: George Lasenby.  Granted he didn't make more than one Bond (a pity), but he was very good in ON HIS MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE.
fifth/sixth: Tied for the bottom of the barrel as Bond.  Both Daniel Craig and Timmothy Dalton are much too dark as Bond. Much too serious. No fun with them.  I know most people like the 'serious' Bond, but not I.  Best of Dalton; LIVING DAYLIGHTS. Best of CRAIG..None!!!  Even in SKYFALL he fails as Bond.  Too bad.  If either Brosnan or Moore were in the Craig/Dalton films I'd rate CASINO ROYALE as the best.
Having said all that, it's still a treat to have all the Bond films and I will indeed add SKYFALL to my collection when available.  Happy viewing!!!",1354406400,,1921,4.674626865671642

The left side page features the actor playing Bond in the movies with the villains.
The right side page holds two Blu-Ray discs with the ""Bond Girl"".

No reason to tell you about the movies.  You know about them unless you have spent the last 50 years on Mars.

The restorations produced a clear picture.  Doctor No has a special feature on how this was done.
They show some pre/post clips illustrating the differences.
The set has almost no information about the movies and special features.  Title and some names are what is available.
No movie length or what special features on the discs is given.

I was worried as I also love all the behind the scene stuff included with my DVD collection and was worried about this set not having quite as much in depth documentaries and such so I was leary about purchasing the set.  Then I found it on sale here the week of Black Friday for $130 and thought, eh...I'll take a chance.

Not only are all of the original documentaries/special features included but new content as well!!  Plus, these movies look great on Blu-Ray!  If you are someone who has the DVD collection from the early 2000's and would like to bring your Bond movies up to date with Blu-Ray this is a great way to do so and not lose any ""Q Branch goodies"" along the way if you like that content as well.

Plus I think it's cool they anticipated Skyfall and left a spot for that movie to be added into this 50 year collection.  Not to mention...I loved Skyfall, my new favorite Bond movie.

I had bought these titles on VHS, then again on their Laser Disc release, then again on their initial DVD release and then again certain titles on BD. I could not afford to buy all 22 on Blu-ray until now. We are watching each of them in order again and enjoying them even more in High Definition. The quality is superb and the sound is worth spending extra for a good theater surround sound system.

The only thing this collection does not do is give you the high definition versions of the 2 remaining James Bond movies filmed. The original film version of Casino Royale (1967) and Never Say Never Again (1983) with Sean Connery reprising his iconic role as the Secret Agent. By the way, I do have these two in Blu-ray to make my collection complete (And I did not pay $400 for the latter one as quoted on the net. Look around you may find it for $12.99 like I did.

Films look great in Blu-Ray and you cannot beat the price here on Amazon.  Shipping was FAST and I was watching the films I've loved over and over within a two days.

The spot left open for Skyfall is very cool, just for the fact that they anticipated there were people like myself that would want to put that disc in with the rest.

This is a great-looking set in a sturdy outer-box with two ""book""-style inner cases to house the discs. I'm not too thrilled with having to slide the discs out and back in every time I watch one, but luckily with proper care they won't get damaged. I would still rather have seen them placed on a more traditional hub-type holder though. Overall, the aesthetics of the set outweigh the questionable disc-holding design. It takes up much less space than having all the films in individual cases, and the front of the box is very stylish in my opinion.

I've only owned the Connery films that were previously available on Blu-ray, but the HD picture quality was outstanding on those. I'm still floored by how good films like Dr. No and Goldfinger can look in high definition on a big tv, so I'm looking forward to finally seeing all the Bond films on Blu-ray.

5019326,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I just recently bought the James Bond complete 22 collection on Blu-Ray and I am very glad I did. I had had my eye on this collection for a few weeks/months... The price was $170 and I was not willing at the time to pull the trigger and buy it. When I saw that the Amazon price dropped to $129.99 for the entire set, I could no longer resist and went ahead and purchased it... Then I checked back a few days later and could not believe the price had skyrocketed to $349.99!!!! That is insane! I definitely do not recommend paying that much for the set. It's unfortunate that the Amazon price is so high, maybe due to high demand now that the Christmas season is here. I love Amazon but I think you are better off being patient and waiting for the price to drop once again. I'm really glad I got the whole set at such a low price!

Regarding the set, the one comment I want to make is regarding the packaging... There are many reviews complaining about the packaging and how difficult it is to remove the discs from the packaging... These negative reviews almost caused me to not purchase the collection but now that I have it I can honestly say that in my opinions these reviewers are making a big deal over nothing. Yes the packaging could be more user friendly but as long as you are careful removing the disc there is absolutely no problem whatsoever. I do not feel like the packaging nor the discs will be damaged in any way through constant use. I actually love the packaging. Can't believe so many people are whining about the packaging. This is an awesome collection. If you can get it for a good price like I did, I highly recommend it. All the Bond movies (except ""never say never again"") in incredible quality!!! I'm very happy with my purchase.",1353974400,2,1755,4.36697247706422
5019327,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I just received the Bond 50 film collection and all I can say is Wow. I love how they packaged the blu-rays into two different books... it looks great on my shelf. As for the movies, I can't wait to sit down and have a marathon watching them all. This is probably my favorite looking collection I have, out of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. just as a packaging standpoint. Definitely recommend this to any serious Bond fan.",1353974400,,427,4.35
5019328,4,B006U1J5ZY,The book style is beefy and has a good feel to it.  I was hoping Skyfall would be included but there is a space available for it.  The only improvement would have been to included some trivia or history notes inserted between the disk pages.,1353974400,,241,4.333333333333333
5019329,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Clearly the films hold up on their own merits, except for the final Moore films. The blu-ray detail is great in many of the films especially Goldfinger and Live and Let Die. Amazing set but the packaging is very poor. It's difficult to get some of the discs out. Also, why they weren't able to restructure the menu of Quantum of Solace so it matches the rest of the set is beyond me.",1353974400,,383,4.260273972602739

I have now watched every Bond movie in order and then watched Skyfall in the theater. This thing even has a saved slot for Skyfall when it comes out!! One of the coolest things Ive ever bought on Amazon.,1353888000,,372,4.109589041095891
5019332,4,B006U1J5ZY,It is a nice set for the money but missing Never Say Never Again which regardless was still a James Bond Movie even though MGM may not have had their fingers in the till for it. Granted not the best James Bond Movie but should still have been included.,1353888000,,252,4.163265306122449
5019333,5,B006U1J5ZY,"There's really not much to say...if you're a Bond fan who doesn't own all the films, this is definitely the way to go.  Twenty-two pristine Blu-rays containing every Eon-produced Bond film.  The only one not included, of course, is Skyfall...but there is a space reserved for it in the packaging!  The quality of the films is astounding.  Even the 50-year-old Dr. No has an unprecedented level of detail now!  The discs are housed in two large books, in secure pockets etched into the thick pages, which includes film artwork.  Overall, a nice, sturdy and beautiful way to present this collection.  I've seen the price of this set vary wildly...ranging from the list price of three hundred to a less then half of that.  Find it at the right price and it's a no-brainer if you love James Bond!",1353888000,,792,4.688405797101449

If the boxset will have the booklet of the introduction of the whole bond series and how this character is formed, it will make the wholeset more complete. In addition, some posters can be bundled as well, in particular not the James Bond but also Bond's girl.",1353888000,,396,4.28

I had the dvd collection and all the extras on those ones are here plus the new ones, i especially recommend the Declassified Mi6 extras on all the discs.

A must-have for any major Bond fanatic.",1353801600,,371,4.3478260869565215

5019338,5,B006U1J5ZY,This was one of amazons deals of the day yesterday. The sale price was $99 and now it's $349 for the bluray. You can't beat that for 22 great movies,1353801600,,148,3.966666666666667
5019339,4,B006U1J5ZY,"i have to admit, this is a great set and must have for any collector...  the box set gives you 22 films with one bonus track and on empty sleeve for skyfall. The set includes 2 sets of books, each containing film releases from 1962-1981 ( book 1)  and the second book is from 1983-2012.

The bad side:  well there is 2  ->  first,  it doesnt include never say never again with Sean Connery and  2nd,  its very difficult taking out the disc without somehow not scratching it.  The blu-rays are really snugged into the sleeve where you have to kinda of pull it out and it causes some minor scratches. I give it a 4 star becuase of this reason. But don't worry,,,blu-rays are very durable compared to dvds and cds so minor scrathces won't affect play.....Overall its a must have and im happy with it and i only paid 130.00 plus tax so i got a good deal on it.",1353715200,,856,4.228395061728395

5019343,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This James Bond Blu Ray collection is a fantastic box set that will appeal to both the casual and serious Bond fan. There are so many great films in this collection, many of which are quite expensive if bought separately ($25-$30 each for a fair amount of the titles.) What makes this collection special is the Blu Ray transfer. The films have been restored to their full potential, and the results are stunning. MGM did a wonderful job ensuring that these movies were presented with the finest video transfer. I've never seen movies pre-2000 look so good on Blu Ray- not even the expensive Star Wars set looks like this. From Dr. No forward, every film presentation in this collection is top notch.

As you probably have seen, many people have voiced problems getting their discs out in their reviews. Yes, the discs are stored in cardboard sleeves, and are pretty snug. However, you don't have to rip the paper or get fingerprints on these discs. To get the films out, put your index finger in the center of the disc, and gently pull the disc to the outer, exposed edge of the cardboard. Keep your index finger in the center, and with your other index finger, lift the disc up with your fingernail. You'll then be able to pull the disc out fine, with no fingerprints, scratches, or any damage to the cardboard. Would another form of packaging with easier disc access have been preferred? Of course. But the present packaging should not bring down a star from this rating. Getting the discs out is not a problem, it's just inconvenient. Practice a little, and you'll get the hang out of it.

I cannot recommend this collection enough. It will be a worthy addition to your film library, and will provide top quality for years of enjoyment. It doesn't get better than this.",1353628800,17,1772,4.640127388535032
5019344,5,B006U1J5ZY,"At $130 for 22 amazingly entertaining tales of Bond (Each has it's own disc), this is a steal. As a long-time 007 fan, this collection was a must-have. The resolution is absolutely crisp at 1080p showing Blu-Ray's true power of resurrecting that amazing experience, as if it were just filmed yesterday. The sound is just as amazing, almost allowing you to hear every henchmen's step as they attempt (And ultimately fail) to assassinate 007. With a soundtrack is so extraordinary, it will no doubt make veteran Bond fans feel nostalgic at the first note. Whether you prefer the classic Sean Connery or the newest Daniel Craig, the Bond 50 collection will allow future generations to experience Bond like never before.. So feel free to sit back, relax, and enjoy these timeless classics with a vodka martini (Shaken, not stirred).",1353542400,5,828,4.9640287769784175

5019348,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Great product and fast shipping!  I ordered late Sat. night around 11:30pm and it was on my doorstep by noon on Tuesday.  I love all the James Bond movies and my wife and I are enjoying watching all of them in order.  The set is really nicely packaged, although I worry about what condition the disks will end up in with any use because they are kept in page sleeves instead of hard cases and they may scratch if they are taken out with any regularity.  Fortunately, there are 22 disks (soon to be 23 as they have made a slot that is reserved for Skyfall when it comes out on Blu-Ray), so it will take a while to get through all of them which will reduce how often they are taken out.  This is a great set for any 007 fan, and I'm surprised to find it under $200 for Blu-Ray (the DVD version is $100 more....)  The set does not include the Casino Royale spoofs, or Never Say Never Again because they aren't part of the EON ""canon.""  So I guess I'll have to get them separately someday to complete the collection.....I'm more of a James Bond fan and I don't really care who the production company is.

However, I was a bit disappointed to see just 8 hours after I ordered it for $149 that the price had dropped another $20 to $129.  I wish there was some kind of 24 hour price assurance for purchases on Amazon.  I guess I'll just shop around before I order from Amazon.",1353456000,4,1369,4.190839694656488

Quality of the remastering is excellent, especially for the old films, which look sharper and clearer than it's ever looked.

My one gripe is that the hardback books which actually house the discs make the discs a little hard to remove, and I can see that the paper may tear if you're too rough with it.",1353196800,,502,4.329787234042553

5019355,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I grew up listening to my father rave about James Bond and can remember watching a few Bond movies during my childhood. Live and Let Die, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Moonraker ring a bell. However, it wasn't until I saw the Pierce Brosnan Bonds that I started paying more attention. By the time the Daniel Craig Bonds came out a few years ago, I was hooked. After having just seen Skyfall in theaters a few days ago, I could barely contain my excitement when I stumbled upon this box set.

All Bonds from the EON ""Canon"" so far? On Blu-ray, and at a great price? Sign me up.

I'm writing this after just watching Dr. No, the video quality is amazing. The sound quality is fantastic, and the sheer volume of bonus features on Dr. No alone is incredible. A theatrical trailer from 1962, as well as radio ads? Yes please.

I can see what some are saying about the packaging for this box set, but I didn't have a problem getting the disc out. I anticipate that this set will be cracked open again and again for quite some time.

One of the most well-known and renowned franchises the world over has never looked better.  Any self-respecting Bond fan will run to pick this up. Considering you've got the Star Wars set going for around $100, and Indiana Jones for about $50 on Blu-ray, to get 22 James Bond movies for the price listed is an absolute STEAL.

What a way to welcome the Bond franchise to another 50 years, and a keepsake to enjoy for generations!",1353110400,4,1462,4.396296296296296

5019362,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I'm working my way through the set (I'm on ""Diamonds are Forever"" at present), and I couldn't be more pleased. The packaging (two hard cover ""books"" with two Blu-Ray discs per ""page"") works well and is very handsome and well-made. There's even an empty slot for the upcoming Blu-Ray of ""Skyfall"", which is a nice touch!

I won't review the films here (buyers of this set almost certainly have seen them all by now and have formed their own judgments) but the Blu-Ray transfers are gorgeous and well worth the step-up from the DVD set. On a big-screen HDTV with a good sound system, even the older films like ""Dr. No"" look and sound absolutely great.

This is an expensive set, but it's well worth the investment for any hard-core Bond fan. The four-star award is provisional for two reasons: one, I may run into a bad disc or something later on in the set, and two, the durability of the packaging may degrade over time.

The approx. running time is 70 minutes (B&W)...This VCR Tape I own has an exclusive intro by author Lee Pfeiffer (""The Incredible World of 007"") explaining the history of the novel, t.v. special and 1967 film version. It is American Made and NOT BRITISH!! It also has ORIGINAL TV ADS for the feature film starring Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress and David Niven. It also (VCR Tape) has Rare photos and collectibles pertaining to the 'Casino Royale' legend. IF you thought the FIRST ACTOR to play James Bond was Sean Connery then you would be WRONG! EIGHT YEARS BEFORE 007 hit the big screens in ""DR.NO"", actor BARRY NELSON brought BOND to life in a LIVE TV version of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel ""Casino Royale"". The show, which AIRED in 1954, has only been seen on television one other time. Anyway, I thought all you Bond Fans (for those who didn't already know this info I just typed) might want to know this. Did some WWW/Internet research on the FIRST BOND GIRL (Linda Christian) and WOW!! Very Interesting background about her and her Family!!!

The supplemental materials are fascinating, and the whole package is a joy--except for the disc packaging. The slipcase idea is fine, but you have to have a background in obstetrics to remove the discs without damage. Of course, perhaps that is intentional, as the viewer should have the enjoyment of an element of danger and adventure just like JB. Got this one on Amazon while it was still a steal, but even if the price is going up, buy it.",1352246400,,568,4.514563106796117
5019373,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Update 11/16: Hi again... guess what? I just received my box set two days ago!!! I was about to purchase the thing at $178, left it in my shopping cart for the day and when I decided it was time to throw away some money, I found the price had dropped to 148.99! Such a lucky strike I decided to leave it in the cart!

This item is really a beauty, the box and disc books feel durable and are classy. Even my wife who isn't really into the 007 mood was surprised about the quality and design. I agree with some people who said it is difficult to take the discs out of the cases, but you just need to be careful not to scratch them when pulling out. Others would prefer to buy cheap disc cases and keep them safe there, well that's valid too. So far I only had time to watch the credits songs feature from the bonus disc, but will find some time to go through the rest this weekend.

In a nutshell, I am really pleased with what I have seen so far from this very-in-advance Christmas present to myself. I also purchased the movie posters hardcover book and the 50th anniversary double CD, can't wait to have them in my hands.

Enjoy!
--------------

Wow! I've been following this item for a while and have missed a lot of opportunities to purchase it, which I deeply regret... I use to rent Bond movies for my so called 007 Marathon just before a new release of the franchise, but I want to switch the rented DVDs for my own 50th Anniversary Blu-ray collection. Bond films are really enjoyable, I always have fun with 007 and company no matter how many times I watch them. Plus, you learn history as the movies take you through the years and a variety of political conflicts and so considered threats to the empires and society (that's my cover with my wife, she just can't understand why I like it so much).

However, I do not know if I will ever own one of these box sets, the price just seems to keep going up as the days go by. About two weeks ago I am pretty sure I saw it listed around $150.00 (no hard cover books included, though). Last week it was nearly $179.00. Today I am almost crying after confirming the price went up to $225.00 (and still no books!). What can I say, I really want it but don't want to throw over $200.00 and then realize some days after that the price fell again. I may end up ordering from eBay, got a better price there.

In the meantime I will enjoy watching Skyfall at the IMAX theater tomorrow.

I must say, the blu ray remasters are like watching brand new movies.  The sound and visual improvements make them all seem new. I have never enjoyed the movies as much, including when I saw them in a theater!  The set would make an exceptional gift for a Bond fan.",1352073600,2,434,4.192771084337349

However, there is a film missing!  ""Never Say Never Again"", the 1983 remake of ""Thunderball"" which reprised Sean Connery in the role of James Bond.

5019379,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Well, I'm a Bond fan close enough to a fanatic, 'cause I couldn't wait to find out if the 8 previously unavailable on BR movies will be released individually later on and bought this ... this ... piece of .... well, box. The only good thing about it are precisely those 8 movies. I already had purchased the other ones including ""Never Say Never Again"" which ""is not included since it is not part of the ""series,"" being produced independently"" as Russell Kurtz comments. Otherwise it is a complete waste. You can't pull out a BR disc without stamping it with your fingerprints (I even found one on 2 of the discs - probably from the guy packing them probably in Malaysia) or damaging the packing. I don't know who was the idiot that came out with the ""brilliant"" idea for this stupid box, but it is ... so ... I don't know how to say it. I even looked up but there's no word (impractical can be one) that can sum the impossibility for me to put it (the box) along with the my other BR movies on the shelf. Not up or down or sideways. What I did was to buy empty BR cases, take out the movies from the box, put them in the cases, scan the covers from my DVD copies, work them on Photoshop and print them BR size. Now I have all the 23 Bond movies on my movies shelves. If some time in the future those 8 movies are released separately, I'll buy them, I'll put back the other movies in the box and sell it, get rid of it. The only BR that has no original cover is the one with the bonus material but, I can live without it. Maybe I'll make my own. As for the empty space for the next Bond movie, ""Skyfall"", I hope it will be released in a normal case, not some 3 pound box with some weird pentagon shape.
Besides the 8 previously unavailable on BR movies, the bonus material BR disc is only other thing worth buying the box if you are a Bond fan.",1351987200,,1844,4.110803324099723

Once I saw this package was announced I kept monitoring it until the price went down to $150.  Since I always wanted to watch all the Agent 007 movies, I decided this was a good buy for my.  I just got the product (still need to watch all the movies) but here is what quick review of the product (not the movies):

Here is what I like:
  - Elegant packaging
  - Movies are organized in chronological order
  - Only the necessary amount of disks (only one bonus disk)
  - Pictures of the movies within the packaging
  - Older movies were re-mastered

Here is what I don't like:
  - Getting the disks out of the built-in sleeves inside the packaging might be difficult.
  - I think the packaging is a little bit bulky, it could have been smaller.

In overall, I'm very happy with this box-set.  It is perfect for anyone wanting to watch all the movies or for any Bond fan not caring that much about extras.",1351641600,,1044,4.300518134715026

5019386,1,B006U1J5ZY,"These guys, i believe its MGM is the responsible party, are criminals. How many times have they double dipped these movies? There was i think three DVD versions, ON blu ray They released three box sets with 9 of the movies and then stopped, i assume due to their financial difficulties, although why you would stop producing one of the things you KNOW is going to sell seems a questionable decision. Anyway when they finally get solvent again they Dont finish the previous sets and try and make us buy the 9 we already bought on blu ray again? Im done with them. I already have the 9, there are 7 more available through walmart or because they were the newer daniel craig ones. I bet you they will eventually release these all individually after they have ripped all the hard core fans for a year or two. Dont give them more money.",1351641600,18,831,4.437908496732026
5019387,5,B006U1J5ZY,"NB: As is their wont, Amazon have bundled the reviews for the Blu-ray and DVD boxed sets together. This review refers to the Blu-ray edition. Please bear in mind that the DVD version only includes the one-disc versions of the films, losing nearly all the extras apart from the audio commentaries.

With the release of Skyfall imminent, EON and MGM/UA have finally got around to releasing the remaining Bond films that weren't on Blu-ray (with the exception of non-EON entries Never Say Never Again and the 1967 Casino Royale), releasing them in a lavish boxed set that's surprisingly sturdily constructed but offers virtually nothing new for those who have already faithfully collected the Ultimate Edition DVDs. The plentiful extras have been carried over pretty much wholesale from those two-disc releases, with one exception - Casino Royale is a strange hybrid of the two-disc special edition and first single-disc release, containing most of the special edition's extras but losing Martin Campbell's picture-in-picture commentary, two featurettes (The Art of the Freerun, Catching a Plane - From Storyboard to Screen), the revised documentary Bond Girls Are Forever, storyboard sequence and filmmaker profile featurettes (Martin Campbell, Chris Corbauld, Phil Mheux, Gary Powell, Alexander Witt and David Arnold). The version of Die Another Day only features the extras from the Ultimate Edition, with the much better extras from the original DVD release, including the 76-minute making of documentary, still AWOL.

The picture quality is for the most part very good, though it's not always as convincing as you feel it should be, with the suspicion that some scenes have been scrubbed up a little too brightly compared to the way they looked on the big screen. GoldenEye thankfully corrects the overcropping of the Ultimate Edition DVD release that was particularly noticeable when cutting off letters and numbers on video displays and is now in the proper framing but it has some noticeable DNR work done on it, though it's not as dramatic as some reports claim. More worrying is that the UK set doesn't offer the original mono soundtracks on the early Bond films that were previously released on Blu-ray, such as Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball, instead offering remixed stereo tracks that often favour the sound effects a little too much. The new to BD titles do contain the original mixes, but if you want them on the earlier films you'll have to buy the US set - which will cause a problem for those without multi-region Blu-ray capability since the set is a mixture of Region A-locked titles (Dr No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Licence to Kill, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) and Region-free ones (You Only Live Twice, OHMSS - thankfully the uncut version - Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies).

As for the exclusive extras disc - well, it's a huge disappointment. Rather than include any new extras from Quantum of Solace such as the deleted ""The name's Bond. James Bond"" ending or any of the slew of other promos or documentaries about the series it's just a brief selection of soundbites, very brief featurettes, a few video diaries for Skyfall and a collection of title sequences from the films. There's no booklet either, but at least the book-style packaging for the films is especially strong, has a space reserved for Skyfall and is designed for repeated use - which plenty of these films will be getting",1351555200,3,3688,5.022875816993464
5019388,5,B006U1J5ZY,"If you're a Bond fan, Bond 50 is worth every penny. The movies look and sound fabulous, with only a few exceptions that are forgivable given the set's overall quality. These movies remain cheesy as hell, but still delightful. And with 22 films in the set it's a great bargain on sale. Highly recommended!",1351555200,,304,4.648148148148148

5019390,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I can't really complain about the films' quality since the 22 films were made in a span of 50 years and obviously movie making have improved a hundredfold since the first film, so to me it is just normal to have different quality in each one of them. I'm just happy that I was able to purchase and own this complete 22 Bond Film Collection which no other movie was able equal in terms of number of sequels and length of time. My only complaint is in the packaging to which I agree with many reviewers who experienced difficulties in removing the discs from the carton sleeves. Normally, we remove a disc from the plastic case using our thumb pressing the center knob together with the index finger holding the edge of the disc. But here in the Bond 50 sleeves, there is no center knob to hold the disc, and the thumb can't even fit into the disc's center hole as only half of the hole is accessible. No gap of space between the disc and the carton surface was provided for the thumb to obtain leverage in holding the disc. In short, it's quite a mess just removing the disc from the sleeves.",1351555200,7,1091,4.326829268292683

5019396,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Being a big Bond fan, I was certainly looking forward to this set, and for the most part I am not disappointed. One thing though,I thought the Bonus disc would have a bit more content, and the piece with the actors who played James Bond is just a clip series with nothing new added.  One thing I do want to note, that I'm sure most people are asking is, is everything included from previous releases - for the most part, the answer is yes.  I had a originally owned most of the Special Edition DVD releases, with the exception of Live and Let Die, Man with the Golden Gun, Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, View to a Kill, License to Kill, and World is Not Enough.  The rest, including a Blu-Ray of Quantum of Solace I had. First thing I did when I got the 50 year set was to compare to what I already had.  I'm happy to say everything seems to have been brought over, plus the stuff when the the Ultimate Editions were released is also added (like commentaries from Roger Moore).  Now I can't comment for the movies I mentioned that I did not have, but it looks complete, with a couple exceptions. I noticed that the Die Another Day disc on the 50 year set does not have the Madonna music video, nor the Behind the Scenes featurette of that music video.  Also, the Casino Royale disc does not have the Bond Girls are Forever Documentary that former Bond girl, herself, Maryam D'Abo did back in 2006, that was on the 2 disc Special Edition release back then.  Also, if it matters, the Quantum of Solace disc on the 50 year set is the exact same as the previous Blu Ray realease, where as the rest have all had their Menus formatted to look the same, no big deal though. Glad most of it has been retained, but it should be noted, outside of the bonus disc, nothing new has been added, but the picture and sound quality, especially of the early movies, is greatly improved.",1351382400,9,1866,4.299145299145299

5019400,4,B006U1J5ZY,"As a devoted James Bond aficianado it was a foregone conclusion that I would order the Bond 50 bluray boxed set containing all 23 Bond films. I was able to purchase the set via Amazon at a reduced price of $150.00 with the condensed hardcover book of 50 years of James Bond Posters included. Parenthetically, I would like to emphasize that I subsequently ordered the full sized edition of the 50 years of Bond posters and that book is a revelation! The edition is spectacular, with much more content and the presentation is marvelous; a coffee table book in a slipcover with multiple versions of Bond theatrical posters from all of the Connery landmark films, including great posters from Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, etc. that bring back many happy childhood memories. If you have the original version of James Bond Posters issued in the mid to late 90's there is no comparison with the 2012 edition. However, returning to the Bond 50 bluray boxed set, overall, the presentation has to be regarded aa a disappointment. The individual discs are not properly protected and are placed in a sleeve, almost like a travel version of the earlier Special Edition boxes. Moreover, a commemorative edition of fifty years of Bond films should have had an accompanying hardcover book issued by Eon Productions with recollections from Sean Connery, Roger Moore { although I am cognizant of the fact that Moore has just issued his own ""Bond On Bond"" book with photos, reminiscences of his participation in the movies, etc. ] Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, George Lazenby and Daniel Craig, as well as archival photos, rather than this spartan presentation. The special features disc is rather pedestrian, with a montage of the opening credits sequences and some preview features regarding ""Skyfall"". The opening in the second box for the bluray disc of the current Bond film in 2013 is somewhat ludicrous, in view of the fact that there will undoubtedly be a deluxe bluray edition of ""Skyfall"" with a Making Of Disc containing interviews with Craig, Mendes, Broccoli, Bardem, Fiennes, Dench and members of the production staff. Unless the manufacturers anticipate that fans will pruchase two sets of Skyfall; one to collect and one for insertion into the slipcover box, this idea was ill advised. Having made these observations, if you want a complete set of all Bond films in optimum form with ""state of the art"" remastering, this set is for you.",1351209600,2,2482,4.954436450839329

5019415,4,B006U1J5ZY,"This review is by a fifty-something male who has watched all the Bond shows previously. Some salient points I'd make are:
1. I bought the DVD collection for about $100, so the cost per movie seemed acceptable.
2. Show quality was good.
3. Nice to have them all together, even the Roger Moore ones.
4. Interesting to watch through the series how the Bond character evolves from the suave, rump-spanking chauvinistic character of the sixties (Connery) to the damaged-goods sensitivity of the ""new millenium"" Bond (Craig).
5. The singular irritating thing that the producers of the DVD did was to make the audience endure a short commercial touting the Bond series, as well as the FBI warning. You can't bail out early. How f_______ irksome! Why advertise what we have already bought?
6. I'd still recommend the purchase despite the forced commercial.",1350777600,8,848,4.97887323943662

Goldfinger - The gold is gone. Why screw with the color? The scene where she's painted gold has lost its golden touch and has been moved towards a more natural color. Yes, she's gold, but the original scene had a golden tint all around

Thunderball - Some color changes and slight damage, DNR, fake grain

You Only Live Twice - Original colors are lost and it's largely brown.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Contrast boosted way too much. Also, original colors are lost and it's largely brown. Audio issues on both the mono (Muffled in spots) and remix.

Diamonds Are forever - Changes in color and lack of detail. Original colors are lost--it's lost its ""glimmer"" and is largely brown now. Desaturated. Also, the scene where a cigarette is put out in Bond's chest isn't supposed to show the ashtray until he stands up, as seen in the original theatrical prints--the scene is supposed to be much darker

Live and Let Die - Okay blu-ray
The Man with the Golden Gun - Okay blu-ray, colors off
The Spy Who Loved Me - Excellent blu-ray
Moonraker -  slightly squeezed and window-boxed main title sequence, okay otherwise

For Your Eyes Only - Fine blu-ray

Octopussy - Excessive edge enhancement

A View to a Kill - Image is misframed/cropped. Also, during an earthquake scene, the image/camera was supposed to shake. Lowry stabilized the image so that it doesn't shake anymore--poor attention to what they were doing. Too much DNR.

The Living Daylights - Excellent blu-ray.
Licence to Kill - Decent blu-ray

Goldeneye - Extreme use of DNR takes away the film grain, and therefore the detail contained within the grain. MGM used an old, outdated master from a few years ago. Think of how bad the original release of Patton looked... the line ""You were expecting someone else?"" missing from trailer

Tomorrow Never Dies - Excellent blu-ray
The World is Not Enough - Excellent blu-ray
Die Another Day - Excellent blu-ray

Casino Royale - Excellent blu-ray, but it's the North American edited version, not the uncut version

Quantum of Solace - Excellent blu-ray",1350432000,"1,123",2452,4.886473429951691

Plus there is a slot in the book for the new Bond Blu-Ray, SkyFall, when it comes out in 2013.  I recommend it to any Bond fan.",1350172800,,275,3.689655172413793
5019420,3,B006U1J5ZY,"Purchased this item and I don't regret it but I must say that, although the blu-ray quality is excellent, the mid-range of these films after Thunderball and up to the Timothy Dalton films stink to high heaven.  The insane propositions of films like ""You Only Live Twice"", ""Diamonds are Forever"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" and others almost too numerous to mention, strain credulity and bastardize Fleming's excellent novels. They were never really that great until the Dalton and Brosnan films came out and the acting left a lot to be desired - kudos however to Honor Blackman but Lady Diana Rigg acted as if she was in a zombie movie, probably her reaction to the script.  Casino Royale with Craig was very good also. Even 'From Russia With Love' left a lot to be desired with the nonsense about SPECTRE instead of the well crafted story regarding SMERSH. Maybe the writers were afraid of alienating the Soviets.  One of my favorite novels was the last one, ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" with old 'Pistols Scaramanga' turned into a crazy thing about solar energy and a mad dwarf with a guy who played Dracula as he was an English butler, turning a ball point pen and lighter into a pistol. Please. I don't know how people with the stature of Connery and Moore, both knighted, ever stood still for such crazy writing.  The fact that these films made a lot of money does not indicate they were well written, in good taste, or with any plausibility. T & A ruled the day but it doesn't make up for the story disasters. I'm thankful they didn't make such a mockery of LeCarre'-Smiley's People, Russia House, etc.",1350086400,2,1612,4.606271777003484
5019421,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I bought this set even though I already have 20 of the 22 titles because I was
impressed with the booklet packaging of all 22 movies.  I was severly
disappointed to find out their was No reviews or explanations of the movies
whatsoever.  I could not remember all the plot lines and have difficulity
in finding out which title is which movie.  I find two or three sentence
descriptions extremely helpful in deciding which movie is which.  I would
hope they would cocme out with a booklet that would have this information
and would fit in the box set case and be sold seperately. I know they will
eventually come out with a collector's ediiton with this booklet included.
How about giving us early purchaser a chance to get this booklet for our
sets.",1350086400,,748,4.559701492537314
5019422,4,B006U1J5ZY,"It's quite a treat to have all the Bond films to date in HD, in one package.  They were even nice enough to include an empty slot for the 2013 Blu-ray release of ""Skyfall"" (although a coupon for a free or discounted copy would have been icing on the cake).  I bought all the MGM Special Edition DVD's back in the late 90's/early 2000's, and was impressed with the video quality even then.  Well, most of these simply blow those releases away.  Dr. No is 50 years old and looks like it could have been shot last year.  If you've got a good home theater setup and like Bond, there's no question you must have this set.

However, as others have mentioned, the packaging leaves much to be desired.  It certainly LOOKS nice at first: Two hardcover DVD books in a sturdy hardcover shell.  Then you open it up, and see that there is simply NO way to remove a disc without either tearing the package or getting your fingerprints on the playing side of the disc.  I was further disappointed to find NO supplemental physical materials, such as an informative booklet filled with glossy photos.  Even the aforementioned DVD releases had nice booklets detailing each film's production.  This actualy extends to an overall gripe I have with Blu-rays: Do companies really think that movie lovers who care about movies enough to invest hundreds or even thousands of dollars on home theater equipment are really not interested in knowing more about the movies we love, and possessing some physical media related to them?

For those who may not have bought the DVD releases but do indeed enjoy learning more about the movies, you'll be happy to know that almost all the discs have extensive bonus material relating to the individual films, and the Bond legacy as a whole.  The Connery, Lazenby, Moore, and Dalton films each have nice 30 to 40-minute documentaries on the films themselves.  Many, many other featurettes cover 007's girls, gadgets, guns, music, exotic locations, etc.  For those with the time to explore them, it's a real treasure trove.

If you can overlook the packaging deficits, it's a fantastic opportunity to own the very best quality copies of these films.  I pre-ordered and got the set for $150, so I definitely think it was worth the money.",1349913600,4,2248,4.723076923076923
5019423,4,B006U1J5ZY,"This is a great collection at a really good price. However, shop around as I bought my copy at Costco for $150.00. No sense in a film by film review as most who are interested already know the films. For those who have not seen them all, I will sum up by saying of the 22 films you are getting 13 movies I would rate as ""very good to classic"", 5 films  I would rate as ""good"" and 4 films  I would rate as ""average."" I think many will find the Dalton Bonds hold up surprising well. Younger viewers raised on non stop action may find the Connery classics to be a little slow moving. Those raised on the Connery films will really enjoy how good they look.

The transfers overall are wonderful. I don't think the films have ever looked better on home video. The extras are plentiful but lacking when it comes to original material. I think the packaging is real nice. I would have liked a booklet on production info or at least some info on what extras are on what disc. I also would have liked the plastic snap disc holders, but to me these are minor issues. The overall value is outstanding when you consider you are getting 22 movies on blu ray for around $6.50 to $8.50 per disc. That is very cheap compared to the Star Wars or Indiana Jones box sets, when compared on a per disc basis. Give MGM credit for not ripping Bond fans off with this set. If you enjoy James Bond this is a great set that will give you hours on enjoyment.",1349913600,,1429,4.189090909090909
5019424,5,B006U1J5ZY,"So for us who have bought the available Blu-ray Bond films previously, this is a stretch to buy all 22 again, just for the 8 or 9 that are new to Blu-ray. A few reviews state that these are only available in the set and that is not the case. Diamonds are Forever, Octopussy and Goldeneye are available separately as a WalMart 'exclusive"". You Only Live Twice is a Best Buy exclusive. I assume the others are exclusively scattered around the city and I just have to find them. Can anyone help? Post here is you find where the other exclusives are located. BTW, the price is great, just $9.99 for the WalMart exclusives.",1349827200,2,618,4.4298245614035086

5019426,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I don't know when the price for this Bond set will change, but it's currently at 178.99, which means its around $8.14 per movie.  That's a great price for Blu-Ray.  If you know someone that is a big time James Bond fan, this would make an excellent gift.  I am currently watching the Man with the Golden Gun on Epix in HD and it looks great.  I have the regular DVDs, so the question comes, do you want the Bond movies in HD.  Personally, I think it is worth it.  With the size of TVs and the quality, a regular DVD upscales to only 480p.  There is some noticeable degradation on a 55 inch TV when I watch a regular DVD.  Now we all know that Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace came out after Blu-Ray technology, so they look spectacular.  But so far, from what I can tell from the older films in HD, the sound and picture looks great.  Now the other DVDs I have, have some amazing extras, but I have gotten to a point in my life that Extras aren't that important.  I like the movies, I would like to see them in HD.  This continues to be a great franchise and for the upcoming Holidays for your father, brother, uncle, mother, or whoever you know in your life that grew up with James Bond, this would make a great purchase.  Oh and by the way, the regular DVD Bond set (21 movies) is going from $250-$780 for the 42 disc set on this very site(obviously someone has lost their ever loving mind with that price), so, who knows, this collection might increase in value.",1349740800,,1467,4.21505376344086

5019430,1,B006U1J5ZY,"The packaging for this release is predictably terrible.  It's a storage nightmare and the disks are somewhat difficult to remove from the sleeves.  Add to that the fact that Amazon simply dropped this $150+ set into an envelope for shipping, and it's a bad experience.",1349568000,28,268,4.933333333333334
5019431,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I love the Bond Franchise, but I hate what they have done with this set. Yes all of them are on Blu Ray, and they all look fantastic. I drooled when I saw Dr. No when I popped in the disc. It's the way Fox packaged it that gets me annoyed. They're in these two big paper booklets, it gives you no information unlike the little pamphlets they gave you in the DVD Collection, and its impossible to take a disc out without ripping the ends off the page. The next thing is the special features. If you are a Bond fan there is nothing new on here. They just threw together a six minute montage of all the Actors who played Bond, they have the World of Bond which is just clips from the movie, and they have the video blogs from Skyfall that you can watch online. All the special features from the DVD are already on here. I also was supposed to receive a book of poster variants, but I never got it. I paid 150 for something that I could have gotten for 100. Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund, so  to them thank you and I will return to shop here. (See what I did there =]) In any case, (I did it again!), if you just wantt to own all of them on Blu Ray and don't give a damn about the Special Features go right ahead and buy it. The transfers are beautiful like I said before.",1349568000,4,1281,3.9844357976653697
5019432,5,B006U1J5ZY,"A few years ago these movies were cleaned up and all the dirt and scratches were removed for the Ultimate Edition DVD's. They looked very good and much better than any VHS, laser disc or even previous DVD releases, it was quite an achievement. Now they come to us in Blu Ray and look and sound even more amazing and literally stunning to watch. Also it is very nice to have all the James Bond movies finally released in one package for a low price ($170 dollars for 22 Blu Ray discs IS a low price).

I know some people are bitter because they bought the other Blu Ray bond releases with 3 movies in a collection just to now have them all released in 1 set and I can understand their frustrations but many of us knew Fox would do this and I chose to wait. It also makes sense they did it now since Skyfall is coming out next month and in celebrating the 50 year anniversary of James Bond. I also know people have complained about the packaging, I for one like it. I have heard how the discs can be scratched, well I own the same type of packaging for the Alien Anthology on Blu Ray and Star Wars the Complete Saga and I have not scratched a single disc.

In the end people who are James Bond fans and want these movies in High Def are going to buy this set and not find excuses like packaging or lack of digital copies (which a very few percentage of people use anyway)to keep them from watching these movies. The picture and sound quality is better than any other previous release and having them all together in 1 set is just awesome. If you are a James Bond fan and own a Blu Ray player you should buy this set and not listen to people who just nit pick or like to troll.",1349568000,7,1674,4.131901840490798
5019433,3,B006U1J5ZY,"Ya gotta love the pricing of this set of Bond movies: New: $170.00; Used from $198.94. Yeah, right, like I'm really going to buy a used set for more than a new one!

Actually, I'm not going to buy either. For one thing, I don't have Blu-ray equipment, just one of those pesky DVD players. And from what I've read of customer comments, there are no bonus features on the DVD version, only on the Blu-ray. Now is this called trying to force us to move to Blu-ray? Sure seems like it.

Anyway, I have the full four-volume set of Bond movies that came out several years ago, five films per volume, two discs per film, with little booklets for each film. True, this set doesn't include the most recent movies, starring Daniel Craig. On the other hand, I'm one of those old-school Bond fans who don't like Craig to begin with, so the lack of his films in the set doesn't bother me at all. (On the other hand, being a Bond fan, I do own the Craig movies. I just don't watch them!)

My only objection to the four-volume set is the scattering of the films throughout the set. If you want only the Sean Connery Bonds, you have to buy all four volumes. If you want only the Roger Moore Bonds, ditto. I suppose it's called ""marketing,"" but I find it annoying if, say, I want to have a Sean Connery ""festival"" I have to go back and forth from one volume to another. But I can cope with that.

The packaging is great and there are TONS of extras just on the ""Thunderball"" disc.  I assume all the other discs are the same.  Firing up ""You Only Live Twice"" tonight.

I don't think much thought went into the design of that container. Since I already have some of these films on Blu-ray and don't necessarily like them all, I will wait until they are separately available at a good price and buy the ones I want.",1349481600,10,470,4.650602409638554
5019436,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The Blu-ray set arrived about a week ago and I have watched one disk each day since. No point in my re-telling the stories, please read other reviews for that. Rather, I want to address the quality and features of this specific set.

The quality of the images (watched on an LG 47"" Led tv via a Sony 3D/Blu-ray player and Sony sound bar) is absolutely fabulous! Each film has been meticulously converted from the ORIGINAL NEGATIVES to digital resulting in exceptional clarity with brilliant color. WOW! Great job!

So far I've watched all of the disks starring Sean Connery as Bond (Never Say Never Again is not included in the set as it was produced by another company). I first saw these films when they were originally released at the famous old grand theatres in downtown Chicago, and have watched them many times since on tv, VHS, and DVD. Short of viewing these films on a big theatre screen, this Blu-ray set is the next best thing - or possibly better - as I can watch in my jammies and the set includes hours and hours of bonus features.

One fun thing I notice about the early movies is how current and stylish everything looks. As is said ""everything old becomes new again"", since Mad Men has become so popular, mid-century modern decor is now considered chic as is the clothing of the 60's and 70's. Except for the cars and Bond's swim trunks, the films look as if they could have been filmed today!

I like the album-style packaging and have no problem removing or returning disks to their slots. Plastic clamshells would have been an improvement, though they probably would have raised the cost of the set. I appreciate that a slot is reserved for Skyfall, due for November theatre release.

Each of the disks I've watched contain plenty of extras, some way more than others. All contain at least one or two optional commentary versions. So far they all appear to have been produced in the 80's or 90's. One disk contains a documentary on the process of converting the original negatives to Blu-ray format, each film taking hours and hours to convert.  The results are stunning and the results even amazed the technicians. The sharpness and crispness at times made it seem almost like I was watching Dr. No and From Russia With Love in 3D. (Feel free to disagree, but that's how I saw them!)

The bonus features include an incredible amount of additional content such as premier openings, deleted scenes, screen tests, documentaries on filming, special effects, martial arts training, casting, props, location scouting, as well as brief bios of Ian Fleming, Sean Connery and other cast members, original commercials and tv specials about the films (60's and 70's vintage so of poor quality), toys, collectibles and other Bond merchandise promoting the movies. Whew! I said it was hours and hours! One day I watched over six hours straight and still hadn't seen everything on the disk.

The complete set includes 22 Blu-ray disks, one disk of bonus material (besides what is on each movie disk),  stored in two albums that fit it into a slick slipcase and the 70 page hardcover book, ""James Bond 50 Years of Movie Posters"".

I was glad I pre-ordered this set months go. Amazon lowered the price after shipping my set so they refunded the $30 difference, plus as an Amazon Prime member, shipping was free. I initially hesitated pre-ordering the set when originally offered at almost $200.00. But after seeing the quality and all the features the set contains I now think it is definitely worth it, after all it's less than $10 per disk. Once these sets are gone, it may probably be years or decades, before a new set is issued (or maybe never if everything actually goes to owning by downloading the file or watching via instant streaming!)

As the Bond culture lives on, all items Bond go up in price on the secondary market. Every time a new film is released new Bond fans are created. I recently introduced my 14 year old granddaughter to Sean Connery as James Bond in Dr. No and she loved it so much she took home eight of the extra Flemming novels I had!

The 14 Flemming Bond books have also been reissued for the anniversary, priced individually, not as a set. The last time a set was issued was in 2002 and I was fortunate to obtain a complete set via Amazon's secondary market some months ago for about $150.00.

If you are a Bond fan I think you will love this set as much as I do. Every fan has their favorite Bond movie, villian, woman and favorite Bond. Not every film is great, not every Bond actor acclaimed. But there surely is much great (and timeless) entertainment here for Bond to be alive and kicking for over 50 years!

The packaging was great and I had no issues the discs are presented beautifully in hard back books and I was generally happy with all that came with...  I've watched a few of the films at this point and while they all look and sound better than ever; it seems the menu screens and interface is identical to the 2006 dvd box sets and the blu-rays that I already had.(though I haven't checked the special features yet)  This doesn't bother me though because I thought these menus were pretty awesome and probably didn't need fixing anyway.  Casino Royale which was not present in the old special edition has also been updated to have the same menu design, features and interface as the old special edition as well so it seems it was a very conscious choice to stick with the old...  The only annoying thing to me and this really is just annoying because it comes off as extremely lazy and kind of ruins the uniformity of it all is that Quantum of Solace was not updated in this way AT ALL...  With the exception of the label on the disc; Quantum is literally a direct copy from the original blu-ray release complete with dated movie previews from 2008 (Australia, Valkerie, etc.) making it the only film to even have advertisements for other movies on the disc as well as having a different menu from all the other films which is the same menu from the original blu-ray...  I say again it is a DIRECT copy of the blu-ray you may already have in every way...  That is a small complaint though and QOS still plays as good as ever, I just found it to be very lazy.....

I actually watched some of the behinds the scenes stuff and the special on the process used to redo the video.  All very cool.  The video cleanup done on Dr. NO is amazing, it really is like watching a much more modern movie set in the 60's.  The sound occasionally get a bit too quiet but I blame that on the original sound recording of the time.  But in general it was a superb experience.  I then went and started with Moonraker.  WOW!  Looked amazing.  JAWS looks damn cool.  Can't wait to watch more. The book with the poster art was very neat too.  The case the set comes in is very nice.",1349222400,2,680,4.007462686567164

This is a wonderful transfer to Blu-ray for this great series. There is no doubt that this Blu-ray package represents the very best picture for these movies since their original theatrical release. I have owned this James Bond series on every medium released. VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and now this Blu-ray release. There is no comparison. This has stunningly exceptional video quality. The sound is also excellent. There are only a couple of the films where the sound mix levels were a little uneven (dialogue volume versus background music) but these are just a few instances and therefore quite negligible. Particularly at this price, I highly recommend the purchase of this Blu-ray set. I have just one complaint which is why my rating is a ""4"" and not a ""5"". The book that the Blu-ray discs are housed in, does not have the conventional center clasp that securely holds the Blu-ray disc in place. Instead, the discs are housed in a slot that you have to slide them in and out of. This is quite poor because of the risk of damaging the discs. I think that springing for the additional expense of proper disc holders within the book would have been worth it, even if it meant charging a little bit more for the product.",1349136000,4,1432,5.308370044052864
5019444,4,B006U1J5ZY,"I purchased this set and was alarmed to find two View to a Kill, one in the place of where Octopussy was supposed to be. Also, found it $20 cheaper at Costco. Always shop around before you make the committment. As for quality, some are definite blu ray but others I don't notice it.",1349136000,2,282,4.2407407407407405
5019445,5,B006U1J5ZY,"If you're even half a Bond fan you will love this set. The value alone is incredible. $150  22 blu rays = $6.81 per movie. This is especially economical if you have yet to buy any of the Bonds on blu ray thus far. I myself had already bought quite a few of the blu rays previously available before buying this but I still have no regrets about buying it. 9 of the movies in this set were previously unavailable on blu ray until now. The only thing I could even cite as a negative is that there are no cases for any of the movies. I would have preferred individual movie cases each with cover art and all that stuff but that would have made the set not only extremely large and unwieldy but more expensive. As it is, the set is put together very elegantly and efficiently. It's surprisingly small and compact. Inside the box are two book-like cases of movies, one for each half of the series' history. The discs are housed in cardboard slots along each ""page"" of the case with the opposite page presenting iconic images from the specific movies on each disc. And each disc is loaded with bonus documentaries. All in all, a pretty awesome little package.",1349049600,3,1152,4.383177570093458

5019447,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Finally, all 22 films are here celebrating five decades of James Bond right up to the theatrical release of SKYFALL. This is an interesting and perhaps definitive Bond collection at this point in time. You get the entire series to date from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. This is one of those ""must have"" collections. From Sean Connery to Daniel Craig and think about that one moment. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig all played James Bond on the screen in 22 films over five decades. The diversity of the films, the actors, the directors, the technicians and all the other filmmakers is astounding. We all have our favorite films and our favorite actors portraying James Bond. It is really hard to express an opinion here other than to say that this sums it up for the first 50 years and I am glad that all the films are finally in one set. Amazing when you think about it.

It is interesting at the 50 year milestone to reflect on the films and actors that have portrayed James Bond. I think we like all the films to some extent and some more than others. Some of the films are very endearing to us and others less endearing. We have our favorites. We can be passionate about such things. For me I suppose Sean Connery is the one and only James Bond. I grew up in that era. I lived through those magical times. The Bonds that followed are his and the original filmmakers' legacy. There is the natural progression of the series that continues to this day. The films I like in particular are DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. For one reason or another I find these endearing and I enjoy watching them over and over again.

Of all the actors that have portrayed James Bond I believe that Sean Connery embodied everything that there was that made his James Bond an icon. Of the actors that followed, my favorite is George Lazenby. He makes one film that is arguably one of the best and for the first time he brought some depth to the character that was closer to Ian Fleming's literary creation and never explored in Connery's films. George Lazenby looks very good and acts very good during certain scenes and moments and then in a split second his acting appears awkward. He lacked consistency in that department. Yet, overall he visually appears very confident, self reliant and has a certain self assuredness about him. That is the George Lazenby I remember and he was James Bond.

Roger Moore brought his own interpretation to the role. I thought it was fine. In the Roger Moore films the greater participation of the team of M, Q, Moneypenny and Fredrick Gray (a regular addition to the cast in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) changed and augmented the dynamics of the films. Soviet General Gogol (also added as a regular character in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME ) was also added into the mix. For me it all culminated in A VIEW TO A KILL. It is an end of an era in some ways. Lois Maxwell had been in every film as Miss Moneypenny and her playful banter with Bond first seen with Sean Conney in DR. NO finally came to a cheerful finale with Roger Moore in A VIEW TO A KILL. More or less, we saw them age gracefully and nostalgically over that span of time.

I like Timothy Dalton's James Bond. The films returned to a much harder edged Bond. I liked Dalton's thinking man's no nonsense approach. I liked his approach of taking charge getting the job done as was reminiscent of Lazenby's approach. I prefer THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS of the two that Dalton made, but LICENCE TO KILL is a much better film than first realized and it requires a closer look. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL truly comprise the end of one era as we see many of the filmmakers on those two films end their involvement with the series.

For me, GoldenEye and all the subsequent films up to and including SKYFALL have a different feel and look about them. Of the Pirece Brosnan/Daniel Craig era Bond films I gravitate towards TOMORROW NEVER DIES and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of QUANTUM OF SOLACE. I am interested to see what SKYFALL brings.

When I think of the James Bond series certain things or people come to a nostalgic mind. The music of John Barry, the sets of Ken Adam, Maurice Binder's gun barrel opening and the indelible image of Sean Connery are endearing to me.",1348963200,17,4674,4.505896226415095
5019448,5,B006U1J5ZY,"you would have thought that a series as popular as this would have been already available. such was not the case till this anniversary set. i will not dwell on the movies or their blu-ray quality. what disappointed me most is the packaging. yes, the books have a elegant look and feel to them. but, the discs are wedged into a two per page slip case that just begs to be ripped when trying to remove a disc. i would have preferred slim cases (like matix anthology) making this set much more durable. and the new movie....how will that be offered?",1348963200,2,546,4.415841584158416
5019449,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Let me start off by saying I became a James Bond fan late in life (only a couple of years ago), and the film that opened my eyes to that world was Casino Royale (2006). I was at a friends house at the time, so he decided to put it on because he got this new home theater system and wanted to show off this 'awesome chase scene,' which turned out to be the free run through Madagascar (actually filmed in the Bahamas, I later learned) and it blew my mind. I ended up watching the entire movie- at least a dozen more times since then. The Chris Cornell opening theme and casino-themed sequence have to be the best intro in the series. Daniel Craig is amazing. So I may be biased because this one popped the cherry, but it's my favorite one to date. I had no idea what James Bond was about prior to that, except some spy series which I never really paid much attention to. Post-Casino Royale, I had to find out what the rest of the series was about. I started getting my hands on some of the older films, and eventually was able to see them all. I will not review them individually, since that's what IMDB is around for, but will highlight some personal favorites:

After Daniel Craig, I have to give it up to Sean Connery. Smooth. Debonaire. Just a man's man who sets the precedent. I liked Dr. No, but feel it wasn't as great of an introduction to the series as it could have been. From Russia with Love was where I started getting into it with Mr. Connery. We're set off on a great adventure through Istanbul, with some great villains, and one of the more realistic fight scenes captured on film. And then came Goldfinger. ""GOLDFINGERRRRRR...he's the man..."" Oddjob. Gert Frobe. I will never forget the proper temperature to serve a bottle of Dom at. And who can forget Shirley Bassey blaring over the horns to that classic theme? A close second to ""You Know My Name""

""My name is Pussy Galore.""
""I must be dreaming""
Love it.

So shortly after came the Roger Moore era. Some hits and misses here, but sadly, mostly the latter of the two. He wasn't all bad, but it was a shame to see Bond go South and end up being a cheesy shell of what Connery set the bar to be. Sheriff JW Pepper? Jaws? WTF? You're how old now and Duran Duran is doing your theme song? You should have quit along with disco.

I will admit that I haven't paid much attention to the Dalton/Brosnan films, but plan to dissect them now that this set has arrived. And what a set it is. Beautiful packaging and layout, and a Bond girl keeps each disc company :) The number one complaint seems to be trying to get the discs out of their respective compartments. With a little care it can be done, and it's a minor inconvenience if really one at all.

At $150, this is a hell of a collection. I can't wait to start another marathon now that it's finally here, and am eagerly awaiting the release of Skyfall in November. It's the first Bond film I'll get to see in a theater!",1348876800,7,2935,4.281081081081081
5019450,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Half price is realistically what it should go for anyhow. Yes it is a bit cumbersome to get the discs out, I can manage but some folks certainly will have issues with that. I like the book style packaging nonetheless, and they look classy too. The book of Bond posters is a nice touch, but I would've really liked a detailed timeline book like the Planet of The Apes collection came with. As far as the movies, I'll only comment on the one I've really been waiting for in blu ray, Golden Eye. Beautiful, crisp, detailed presentation well beyond what the DVD offered, and the sound is astounding too. It's been a long wait but I'm reasonably satisfied with the overall package, it would've been nice to have a slot to put my Never Say Never disc in though seeing they couldn't included that disc.",1348876800,,795,4.489655172413793

5019452,4,B006U1J5ZY,"(10-3 UPDATE / expansion starting at paragraph 6)

I haven't watched Bond movies since the mid-90s, and the last recent one I watched was ""The World Is Not Enough."" (1999) By the time deluxe boxed DVD sets of the films came out, I was pretty much maxed out on DVD collecting, and rather disillusioned with the limitations of the fragile medium, and the 007 franchise was in a slump anyway. When I got news of this release, I wish listed it, and here we are, only a few weeks after his pop cultural ""offspring,"" Indiana Jones, hit Blu-Ray. Keep in mind this is from the PoV of one who hasn't watched a single Bond DVD, and therefore skipping straight to Blu-Ray.

Oct 5, 1962 -- Ian Fleming's 007 spy novels had been best sellers for a decade; Kennedy and Khruschev were about to play nuclear tightrope over Cuba; and ""Dr. No"" debuted, and a film franchise, iconic characters and images, and a variety of Bond traditions were born.

The set includes all 22 ""official"" Bond films in nicely designed and colorful packaging -- although I'm still uncomfortable with the studios using tight paper packaging yet again....'twill be investigating. And, yes, how cute, there is a slot for the newest Bond movie, ""Skyfall,"" too. The Blu-Rays come in two books, for pre- and post-""Never Say Never Again"" Bond movies. I mention ""Never Say,"" because it is not included, despite starring Sean Connery, for four reasonable reasons: A) it's a re-make (of ""Thunderball""); B) it's not from the same production co.; C) it's not very good anyway; and D) if you must, then you can probably get it very cheaply by itself. (Then again, I just checked the prices.....uh-oh).
There is also no 1967 ""Casino Royale."" Since it is a parody; complaining about its absence is analogous to moaning about the ""Star Wars"" set not having ""Spaceballs"" in it.

Here at Amazon, the set comes with a book about 007 posters.....at least the ""Exclusive Excerpted Edition."" But hey, don't worry, the Blu-Rays have plenty more poster images on them.

The presentation quality is shockingly stunning, looks fabulous. Cute menu screens with character shots and backlit chicks on wobbly discs waving pistols around-- how very title sequency.

The commentaries are, I suspect, carried over from the DVD releases. For the older films, they are loose compilations of observations and reflections of a variety of people involved in the production: designers, editors, composers, ad campaign designers, and many of the actors. Each film has at least one commentary, and a few even have three. When a commentary goes quiet or into an undesirable topic or monologue, it's good to be able to switch over to another commentary for a little while. Some of the 60s' films' commentaries go into ""now let's hear what Bond sounds like in ""x"" language"" for about five minutes or so at a time; again, good to switch and keep the info. flowing. During slow spots, you can also play with the other extras, arranged along the following pattern:

Top Level Access ( a rare category): In the case of the ""Dr No"" disk, it's a 12-minute look at the Lowry Digital's efforts and processes of restoring and cleaning the prints of older Bond movies to give it the immaculate presentation that it has on these Blu-Rays.

A) Declassified MI6 Vault: Little vignettes about topics across all the Bond movies -- here on ""Dr. No,"" it's a look at the UK, US, and a few world premieres of all of the pre-Craig 007 movies, and another that looks at ""Guns.""

Lots of behind-the-scenes stuff (which is under category A or C or both) varies wildly, including material from the time of the making of the film in question: featurettes, different angles, on set, on location, effects, storyboards, press conferences, interviews from the time, deleted scenes. Many '60s films have Ford / car co. promo films ranging from mildly informative to weirdly whimsical. (""Child's Guide to Blowing Up a Motor Car,"" from ""Thunderball"" comes to mind.) There are a few screen tests, including those for the Bond That Never Was, Josh Brolin, for ""Octopussy."" That film's extras also include the ultimate reminder of the series' Cold War origins and milieu with location footage of the Berlin Wall.

B) 007 Mission Control (on half the films): Movie-specific looks at 007, Women, Allies, Villains, Mission Combat Manual, Q Branch, and Exotic Locations
The 007 Mission Control sets are on half of the films. The problem is, all they are are just random snippets straight from the films.....isn't that what chapter selection is for?
More of the films have the ""Exotic Locations"" feature, which, unlike the other ""Mission Control"" features, actually has some substance. They are nice 3-min. tour guides (narrated by Maud Adams, no less) of the various places where the Bond movies were filmed.

C) Mission Dossier: Various BTS doc.s: for Dr. No, a strange scratchy vintage 1963 featurette narrated by a funny little man with an enormous nose; an 18min. look at director Terence Young; and a main doc called ""Inside Dr No""
Starting in 1981, you have music videos. (Except for DAD's Madonna song in 2002)

D) Ministry of Propaganda: Trailers, TV spots, radio ads (Goldfinger had over a dozen!), n' such; starting w/""Moonraker,"" some of the films have only theatrical trailer(s) here.

E) Image Database: Photos of the Filmmakers, Portraits of the Cast, BTS photos fm. Jamaica and Pinewood, and some of Ian Fleming fm both places, a small set of pics of the strange ""Lost Scene"" (Ursula vs. crabs), and ""Around the World w/007,"" a collection of posters and the like.

There are tons of image galleries for each movie. (And somewhat fewer for the 21st century Bonds, but still plenty.) Most of them are tiny sets, more average about 2 min.s to sit through, and once in a while there are epic sets of photos that run up to 8 minutes. My favorite category here is ""007 Around the World"" (as in, posters) and ""Merchandising,"" although, alas, these aren't included with every movie.

This categorization essentially stops with the post-Brosnan movies, w/somewhat fewer extras for the newer movies as a result.

And these are all just the minor-sounding extras! I'm saving the various main documentaries (on each film, or on major players) and the bonus disc for later.
While the extras may not be consistent nor complete, they are still pretty comprehensive.
For obvious reasons, it's going to take me a while to go through the whole set, but I suspect this initial run-through gives a great idea of what to expect. Except for the iffy packaging (I use disposable gloves for removing and replacing each disk), I suspect that this set is near perfect, one of the best of the decade so far.",1348704000,4,6673,4.855760773966579

Little difficult to remove the disks, but it's not like I'm going to remove them every day.  The positive side is that the disks are very secure and will not slide around inside the case.  They even give you a space for the upcoming, ""Skyfall"".  The included book ""50 Years of James bond Posters"" was a pleasant surprise to me since I didn't remember reading about that in the description.  Absolutely love this set.

UPDATE 13 October 2012: I started watching some of the Bond movies, and when I reached chapter 22 of ""You Only Live Twice"" the screen froze.  After playing with it for a few minutes, I discovered that chapters 22-28 were damaged.  The disk looked fine, but these chapters simply would not play on any of my blu-ray players.  After that, I decided to watch all of the bond movies to see if I had other bad disks as well, but all of the other disks were good.  So, I called Amazon, and they promptly sent a new set asking me to return my set after the new set arrives.  By the way, I still love this set.

5019458,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Like many Bond aficionados, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of the Bond 50 set since it was originally announced.  While I already owned all the movies (first on VHS, then on DVD), the value of the all the included bonus features in addition to the films that had yet to be released on BD was to enticing to ignore.

The packaging is roughly what you would expect from an uber-expensive DVD collection: the discs are laid out in two large books that contain a host of artwork and photography from the various films.  Pleasantly (and logically) the films are all presented in chronological order.  Collectors and fans of Bond films will recognize that this is a change from the past, when the films were rarely bundled in any sort of logical order.  The second book even contains a slot for Skyfall so when that film is eventually released on BD, the Bond 50 set won't be instantly outdated.  The case and books are both sturdy and should sit on a shelf well, though the pockets the discs are stored in may present difficulties.  Some people may prefer to buy a set of blank clamshells to store the discs in so as not to risk scuffing them up when sliding them out of the pockets.

Included are all the old bonus features and specials that we've seen on the DVD and earlier BD releases.  Fans upgrading from the old DVD sets will be pleased that each film has been condensed into a single disc so no more pesky disc swapping to catch the various featurettes that were included with the DVD releases.  Also included is a new bonus disc that boasts a collection of new features that haven't been released on disc yet.  This includes material from the upcoming Bond film Skyfall and is certainly worth a peak.

The asking price for Bond 50 is high, though even at the MSRP of $299.99 there is a lot of value here.  Casual fans of the series will probably remain better suited to simply pick up (or rent) the older films though serious fans of Bond will certainly appreciate having this collection on their shelves.",1348704000,7,2021,4.519230769230769
5019459,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Just got it from Amazon. Beautiful packaging with two books containing 12 blu rays each (every book has 11 movies; one book has a blu ray with a lots of extras and one book has space for the upcoming new Bond movie, Skyfall where Bond drinks beer instead of martinis...huh?) and an extra book with illustrations of all the posters. I have blu rays and DVD copies of some of the movies.

I will not review here the movies since people who buy these movies already know what to expect. You really need to get these disks. For James Bond fanatics this is THE collection. Just finished Moonraker, one of my favorites. Really great music and I like the battle in space towards the end of the movie. Let's not forget that this is 1979 and the shuttle scenes are close to real life. Knowing that the first real shuttle was launched in 1981 and that the movie started couple of years before 1979, we can appreciate the vision of the director.

Checked some of the disks. No scratches, no fingerprints (except mine when the blu ray was out). Anybody who got the Alien collection should be familiar with this kind of packaging. And the book with the posters looks great.

Five stars all the way for the presentation and the price. Twenty two movies packed with action, great actors, oustanding scripts and direction, and great music for $150! Cannot beat this.",1348617600,4,1350,4.570247933884297

The discs fit very snugg to prevent them falling out, but that makes them a little difficult to remove to view.",1348617600,5,369,4.432835820895522
5019461,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Based on my experience with this box set so far I wanted to address some of the general concerns I've seen on other reviews and comments:

- Received the ""Limited Edition"" with the posters book as expected. (The ""Exclusive Excerpted Edition"" as promised by Amazon to early customers)
- Although I pre-ordered when the price was higher, I was charged $149.99 thanks to Amazon's ""Pre-order Price Guarantee""
- All Blu-ray discs are on pristine condition, no finger prints and/or scratches of any kind (I checked all 23, one by one)
- Received all movies, No duplicates or missing discs.
- The posters book is not inside the Blu-ray book case but they are packaged together on the same shrink wrap and have a golden sticker that says ""Limited Edition""
- All discs up until ""The Living Daylights"" include the PG version of the movie. From ""Licence to Kill"" onwards they are all PG-13 versions, no uncut or unrated versions included.
- No Digital Copy or Ultra Violet code is included with this set. (No way to play these movies on iPad, iPhone or Portable device)

Packaging:
The Blu-ray books are spectacular and make for a great presentation and a really high-end feel for this box set. I can see why people complain about getting the discs out, It's certainly difficult the first few times, but once you get the hang of it, you can get them out with less hassle.

Blu-ray restoration quality:
This is for hard-core videophiles, most fans won't even notice (or care) about the Blu-ray restoration. Bottom line is, these movies look and sound way better than they ever have before.
But for those concerned about DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) and EE (Edge Enhancements) I have now watched several of the movies on this set, specially those that haven't been previously available on Blu-ray and I have to report that although picture quality is greatly enhanced, they do suffer from mild DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) and sometimes heavy Edge Enhancements. The DNR is very mild and not as bothersome as on some other Blu-ray restorations from MGM (Thanks FOX!), but the overuse of Edge Enhancement really shows on some scenes, where the edges of certain objects/characters seem fuzzy against the background. Again, nothing to be concerned about and totally in line with earlier 007 Blu ray releases like ""Dr. No"" or ""From Russia with Love"", just nitpicking.

Summary:
Overall a great box set and highly recommended for any 007 fan (Hard-core or n00b). It's one of the better box sets I've seen recently, not just on the movie content (and quality) which is undeniably great, but also on the packaging and presentation.",1348617600,11,2612,4.8629213483146065
5019462,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I purchased the first Blu Ray collections (I & III) when they became available in 2008. I bought Volume I (Dr No, Die Another Day and Live and Let Die). I also purchased Volume III (Moonraker, Goldfinger and The World Is Not Enough). At the time my local Best Buy did not have Volume II (For Your Eyes Only, Thunderball and From Russia With Love), and I had already purchased Casino Royale (2006), and shortly there after bought Quantum of Solace.
I must say that the movies I have purchased are stunning. It's hard to believe Lowry Digital can take a 50 year old movie and make it look like brand new. I have a 10.5' Gray Wolf Screen and a 1080p DLP projector and Bond never looked so good. But these are all from my 2008 purchases.  It seems that someone at MGM/Danjaq/UA or whoever decided to bundle all 22 films in a package but not offer them separately.  That means if I want to complete my collection I will have to buy the entire set again. I would like to have the collection packaging but I paid $80 each for their first 2 sets, and $25 for the singles, so at this point I would just like to have the remaining 7 films and I'll shut up and go away.
I've done this with Star Wars too many times (and several other titles) to mention and I'm really getting tired of it.",1348617600,4,1277,4.229508196721311
5019463,5,B006U1J5ZY,"OK, there has been mass confusion, so I thought it best to post this as part of the review.  I had pre-ordered the BD set with the Limited Edition hardcover book ""James Bond 50 Years Of Movie Posters"".  However, while my order page still shows that I have ordered the set with the book, when I click on the item link in my order, it actually takes me to an item description page which is missing the book.  That is, it is not linking to the page describing what I had actually ordered.  Not a good sign.

Yesterday I received the BD set but NO BOOK.  After going a few rounds with Amazon customer service over email, I had them call me.  Once on the phone (with a representative name Will), we were able to find the proper solution (such a solution is impossible through any other means because of Amazon's having changed the item description retroactively for the pre-ordered item, a practice I find highly unusual and suspect, especially since I received no email notification of any changes to my order).

In any case, as many others have pointed out, the hardcover book is available for sale individually on Amazon.  While on the phone with Will, I pointed this out to him.  What happened next makes up for the Amazon snafu.  Will asked me to place the item into my cart, and upon examining the item himself, he was satisfied that it was the book that I was supposed to receive.  So he asked me to place the order for the book, which I did, and while on the phone with him, he zeroed all the charges for the order, and changed the delivery method to next-day shipping.  In other words, Amazon is sending me the book at no extra charge (total order: $0.00).

Now, I have no clue whether this book is EXACTLY the same that was supposed to be included with the pre-order, but according to most descriptions, including the one on the original item page on Amazon, it appears that it is the same book.

So if you have pre-ordered the set with the book but did not receive the book, this is the way to obtain it from Amazon free of additional charges.

What I've watched of the BDs so far, this set is well worth the $6.20 or so per movie.",1348617600,6,2137,4.345088161209068
5019464,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I knew this set would be good. I hoped it would be great. It was more than that. First and foremost: The re-mastering of these movies is breathtaking. It looks as if the films from the 60's & 70's were shot yesterday. ABSOLUTELY PRISTINE. It was like watching them again for the first time.

Now the extra features on these discs... mind blowing. Apart from the bonus disc, each of the 22 films have special features that include amazing extras. I watched From Russia With Love last night and literally sat for another hour or two going through all the additional features. From the original trailers (and I mean ALL of them - TV commercials included) to the production stills (gorgeous) to the ""Making of"". The 'Making Of' was particularly interesting as I am a big fan of the original novels, and it was interesting to see how they adapted the book to the screen and how they casted the roles.

The two most amazing extras were: 1) A conversation had between Ian Fleming and the legendary Raymond Chandler (whom I also love) on the character of James Bond and the process by which Fleming sat down to write his books. This discussion should be in the Library of Congress. 2) A running commentary throughout the film with pieces of archived interviews with the director, Terence Young and some of the primary characters. When I first saw that it had a directors commentary I said to myself ""How? Terence Young passed away in 1994."" ... They did it. It was amazing.

Congratulations to the makers of this set. They should be very proud. The 13 year old kid in me, who in 1984, read Dr. No for the first time... is eternally grateful to have this living document of one of the great characters in literature and film of the past 50 years. Thank you.

If you are a serious Bond fan, this is something you simply must purchase. And at this price, it works out to be almost $6 a disc. Incredible.",1348617600,38,1892,4.50728862973761
5019465,4,B006U1J5ZY,"This is the best Bond collection ever put out.  It is a noticeable improvement in picture quality over my older DVD box sets that I purchased in 1999.  I highly recommend purchasing if you are a fan of the 007 movies.  You can't beat the $149.99 price for 22 movies!  If you own all the DVD's like I do, I still think upgrading to Blu-Ray is worth it considering the low cost and exceptional quality.

While I think the packaging is very elegant and nicely designed, I find the slots to remove the Blu-Rays a major fault.  It shouldn't be such a delicate process to remove a disk from its packaging.  I am afraid that down the road the cardboard slots will tear.  I do like that there is a slot for Skyfall.  I just hope that the Skyfall Blu-Ray disk art matches the rest of the collection.  *** Update 2/13, the Skyfall Blu-Ray disk does not match the other disks in this set nor does the menu.  ***

The Special Features Bonus Disk is big let down.  There is nothing worth watching on it.  I was hoping for some new documentaries.  One thing I noticed on this disk is they have all the opening sequence credits, but not Skyfall.  Obviously Skyfall is not released yet, but it kind of makes the disk already out of date since Skyfall is incorporated into this box set.  Had the Skyfall opening been included, it would have been a huge treat for die hard Bond fans.  With all that being said; rest assured all of the best special features are on the individual movie disks.  They are the same special features from the earlier DVD releases.",1348531200,12,1540,4.3780918727915195
5019466,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Wow, just wow. Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE James Bond fan. To me, he is the epitome of the action hero. I watched my first James Bond film (Goldeneye) when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I still remember watching that movie and being absolutely obsessed with it for a good year or so. Since that first movie, I began my mission to watch every single James Bond movie in existence. Even the unofficial ones. Jump forward about 8 years or so, and I bought the entire James Bond collection on DVD and I watched every single film in the order that they were released in. Some I was watching for the 3rd or 4th time, others I was watching for the very first time. I was so happy. There I was, a sophomore in high school, watching all the James Bond movie. Then, 6 years later, I heard of this Blu-ray set...
YES!!!
Instead of being sad that I was going to have to double-dip, I was happy. I was finally going to be able to enjoy James Bond in glorious HD. I sold my DVD's and my Blu-Ray copies of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace to my brother, and I pre-ordered this magnificent set. Boy, was it worth it. The packaging is gorgeous, and very classy. I have yet to see all 22 movies (believe me, not for lack of trying), so I will only be reviewing the ones that I have watched so far. I will update this review as I keep viewing the movies. But so far:

Dr. No: HOLY CRAP!!! Amazing. The restoration is top-notch, the audio is fantastic. It seriously felt like I was watching a movie based in 62 instead of a movie filmed in 62. This is my second favorite Sean Connery movie, falling only behind From Russia with Love. It really is a fantastic film. Expertly paced, and unimaginably cool. Sean Connery really just embodies Bond.  A great way to start off my favorite film series in the world

From Russia with Love: My absolute favorite classic Bond film. This is a tense and well-paced thriller. Rosa Klebb is damn frightening, and we are exposed to SPECTRE for the first time. Once again, the remastering is amazing. The clarity is astounding. The fight between Grant and Bond is fantastic, one of the best in the series. Also Q makes his official appearance! Yay!

Goldfinger: In my opinion, this is the Bond movie that set the stereotypes for all other Bond movies. It is the first movie in the series where there is a theme specifically made for the movie accompanying the opening credits, it is the first movie where the iconic Aston Martin DB5 comes out, it is the first movie where Q makes a meaningful appearance. Goldfinger is an excellent movie. It's well-crafted, and Connery WAS Bond at this point. From Russia with Love is my favorite Bond movie, but Goldfinger is probably the most iconic. The trend of superb transfer follows through with this one.

Thunderball: Perhaps one of the better known Bond films, and with good reason. Riding into his 4th movie, Connery continues to throw it out of the park. I was a little apprehensive to watch this movie, as I remembered that there are a few underwater scenes. I was afraid that the quality was going to be less the spectacular. To my surprise, other than a slightly soft quality, the underwater scenes still look amazing. Great transfer, great movie.

You Only Live Twice: Connery's 5th Bond film. At this point, Connery was starting to show his age. While for the most part, he still looks capable of being Bond there are a few scenes where he looks a little aged. Perhaps a little ridiculous at times, what with the whole trying to make Bond look Japanese, but still a solid Bond film. The hardest thing about seeing an old Bond film in HD is seeing how dated the special effects look. The helicopter fight is a great example of this.

OHMSS: Probably one of the most underrated Bond films. Lazenby had a very good turn as Bond, and I would've been very happy had he continued on with the role. This is of course the film where Bond gets married and becomes a widower. The clarity is astounding in this transfer. I was very surprised.

Goldeneye: My favorite Brosnan movie. Great transfer, but sometimes it can look a bit soft around the edges. Strange how Dr. No manages to look as good as Goldeneye, considering the more than 30 years that separate both movies. Still amazing to watch in HD, and a great movie over all. Definitely one of the high points in the series.

Casino Royale: Damn, it was good to see such a different take on Bond. He's still suave and still smooth, be he is more dangerous. This is my favorite Craig film (so far.) Because this was filmed in 06 it is no surprise that it looks amazing. The amount of detail on-screen is astounding at times. Daniel Craig started off his interpretation of Bond in amazing fashion. The only reason I am able to review this is because I confirmed that this is basically a re-issue of the special edition Blu-ray released a few years ago.

Quantum of Solace: A little underwhelming, but still good. I always knew that it was going to be extremely hard to follow up Casino Royale, which is why I am willing to be a little forgiving with this movie. It's not a bad movie at all, it just isn't as good as Casino Royale or some of the other Bond films. Once again, I confirmed that this is simply a re-issue of the Blu-ray released a few years ago. It looks fantastic.

For future reference, I will give a list of the Bond actors in order from favorite to least favorite. It's always fun to argue with fellow Bond fans as to the order of the list.
Sean Connery is the absolute best.
Daniel Craig is doing a bang up job as my favorite spy. So he comes in second for now.
George Lazenby is not given nearly enough credit for his turn as Bond in OHMSS.
Pierce Brosnan is the man that introduced me to Bond, so he's kind of tied with Lazenby. But points off for Die Another Day. Too campy for my taste.
Timothy Dalton was good in The Living Daylights, but License to Kill was basically Miami Vice: Bond edition.
Roger Moore... I don't dislike him. I am just not crazy about his turn as Bond. Moonraker was my second Bond film, so it holds a soft spot in my head. Other than that, his films are a little too crazy for me.

Keep a look out for updates in the coming days!",1348531200,12,6202,4.374131944444445
5019467,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This review is about the standard DVD set, not the Blu-Ray.  I've always loved the Bond films, but have never made getting them on DVD a priority.  Now that my kids are older and of an age to watch them, I found out this set was coming out and eagerly awaited it -- how awesome is that, ALL of the Bond films in one box set, for a great price!  (Do the math; if you bought all 22 films individually, averaging $25 per movie, that would set you back a whopping $550 - compare that to the $100 sale price for this set.)

HERE'S WHAT YOU GET:
A large box about 11 inches by 7 inches by 1.5 inches.  Inside the box are two beautiful ""hardcover books"" (book one is 1962-1981, book two is 1983-2012).  Inside each book are six heavy pages.  Each page holds two discs that slide into a half-moon slot that secures the disc to the page, and beside each is a photo of the ""Bond Girl"" from that particular movie.  It's not ideal packaging for discs if you intend to get them out and watch them frequently, but if you are like me and just want them on DVD with the intention of watching them occasionally, it's fine.  Besides, empty DVD cases are a penny a dozen online these days if you want to change packaging.

BOOK ONE:
1. Dr No
2. From Russia With Love
3. Goldfinger
4. Thunderball
5. You Only Live Twice
6. On Her Majesty's Secret Service
7. Diamonds Are Forever
8. Live and Let Die
9. The Man With the Golden Gun
10. The Spy Who Loved Me
11. Moonraker
12. For Your Eyes Only

BOOK TWO:
13. Octopussy
14. A View to a Kill
15. The Living Daylights
16. Licence to Kill
17. Goldeneye
18. Tomorrow Never Dies
19. The World is Not Enough
20. Die Another Day
21. Casino Royale
22. Quantum of Solace

WHAT YOU DON'T GET:
1. Any non-Eon (non-canon) Bond films.  So, if you're looking for the Barry Nelson ""Casino Royale"" or the David Niven/Woody Allen ""Casino Royale"" or the Sean Connery ""Never Say Never Again,"" sorry, they're not here.  They're not part of the Eon Productions ""canon"" of Bond films, so they're left out in the cold, and, IMHO, good riddance to them.  (I'm pro-Eon, can you tell?)
2. Extras.  I haven't checked each disc out individually, but nothing in the marketing or the packaging indicates there are any extras in the standard DVD set.  This is a set of no-frills, feature-only discs as far as I can tell.  But I just wanted these films, not a bunch of extras, and that's what I got.  See what I mean about this being the perfect set ""for certain people""?  (I'm told that the Blu-Ray set has a bonus Blu-Ray disc of extras, if that's your thing.  That's the new trend in DVD releases; the extras go on the Blu-Ray version, the standard release gets the shaft.)

Finally, one weird (kinda stupid) thing about the set.  It includes ""a disc holder for Skyfall coming on DVD in 2013.""  In case you didn't know, Bond #23 (""Skyfall"") hits theaters in December 2012.  Obviously, they expect you to buy it on DVD in 2013.  So, in preparation for that, on the last page of Book Two instead of there being half-moon slots for two discs, there's only one empty half-moon slot that says ""This space reserved for SKYFALL.""

Um... if I buy Skyfall, isn't it gonna come in it's own DVD case?  What are we expected to do, put the Skyfall disc in the book and... throw away the case it came in?  (Please don't; please recycle!)

If you don't want any extras, and you don't plan on getting these discs out of their sleeves with any regularity, it's an awesome set for an awesome price if you don't have these on DVD already!",1348531200,165,3517,4.325190839694656
5019468,4,B006U1J5ZY,"My set arrived today (yippie!)...

I won't go into detail on the movies themselves (7 are classics, 8 others are watchable, the rest are garbage, and YMMV), but into the set and its packaging itself.

The booklet format is divided up into 2 books:  1962-1981 (Dr No-For Your Eyes Only) and 1983-2012 (Octopussy - Skyfall Bonus).  Each book contains a terrific graphic design layout, with the discs embedded within.  The discs are not easy to remove from the sleeves, but Blu-Ray's coating makes scratches a lesser problem than you'd think.  Still, it's disconcerting that you have to poke and prod in there to grab and drag out the disc, and why I dropped a point off.  But I will say this - those of us who bought the 3-pak Blu-Ray sets might find this book packaging a big improvement despite it all...  and in that 3-pak, one of the discs was loose and had jostled all around.  But there were no scratches on that disc, reaffirming the higher quality Blu-Ray has all around...

Blu-Ray video quality is what you'll expect - clean, sharp visuals with a fair amount of noise removal but leaving some grain intact - too much noise removal also removes sharpness and detail.  Colors are vibrant, with no bleed that I can find.  It does not get much better than this, for the Blu-Ray format, for Bond.

Sound tends to be crisp and clear for the movies as well.  Not much - if anything - to say for discernible hiss.  The 5.1 mixes aren't always the greatest, but these films deliver where it counts the most - fine handling of the audio restoration process speaks for itself.  No pun intended.

I'm not seeing much difference between the movies in this package compared to what was released in the past... it's just all the movies finally available.

And it's bizarre to see FOX HOME VIDEO logo appear when popping in a disc for a MGM franchise film series!

Bond fans finally get ALL the Bond films on the best home video format, and at $149 it's a steal.",1348531200,7,1954,4.531428571428571
5019469,4,B006U1J5ZY,"The set it great - some of the old transfers are a bit soft, but again, must have.
There seems to be a common issue of DUPLICATE DISKS in the first batch.
I received 2 octopussy and View To A Kill was missing. Others have reported the same (2 Russa with love. 2 TWINE, but no Goldeneye.
Advice: Check your set thoroughly upon receipt!",1348531200,25,334,4.234375
5019470,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Finally, all 22 films are here celebrating five decades of James Bond right up to the theatrical release of SKYFALL. This is an interesting and perhaps definitive Bond collection at this point in time. You get the entire series to date from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. This is one of those ""must have"" collections. From Sean Connery to Daniel Craig and think about that one moment. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig all played James Bond on the screen in 22 films over five decades. The diversity of the films, the actors, the directors, the technicians and all the other filmmakers is astounding. We all have our favorite films and our favorite actors portraying James Bond. It is really hard to express an opinion here other than to say that this sums it up for the first 50 years and I am glad that all the films are finally in one set. Amazing when you think about it.

It is interesting at the 50 year milestone to reflect on the films and actors that have portrayed James Bond. I think we like all the films to some extent and some more than others. Some of the films are very endearing to us and others less endearing. We have our favorites. We can be passionate about such things. For me I suppose Sean Connery is the one and only James Bond. I grew up in that era. I lived through those magical times. The Bonds that followed are his and the original filmmakers' legacy. There is the natural progression of the series that continues to this day. The films I like in particular are DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. For one reason or another I find these endearing and I enjoy watching them over and over again.

Of all the actors that have portrayed James Bond I believe that Sean Connery embodied everything that there was that made his James Bond an icon. Of the actors that followed, my favorite is George Lazenby. He makes one film that is arguably one of the best and for the first time he brought some depth to the character that was closer to Ian Fleming's literary creation and never explored in Connery's films. George Lazenby looks very good and acts very good during certain scenes and moments and then in a split second his acting appears awkward. He lacked consistency in that department. Yet, overall he visually appears very confident, self reliant and has a certain self assuredness about him. That is the George Lazenby I remember and he was James Bond.

Roger Moore brought his own interpretation to the role. I thought it was fine. In the Roger Moore films the greater participation of the team of M, Q, Moneypenny and Fredrick Gray (a regular addition to the cast in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) changed and augmented the dynamics of the films. Soviet General Gogol (also added as a regular character in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME ) was also added into the mix. For me it all culminated in A VIEW TO A KILL. It is an end of an era in some ways. Lois Maxwell had been in every film as Miss Moneypenny and her playful banter with Bond first seen with Sean Conney in DR. NO finally came to a cheerful finale with Roger Moore in A VIEW TO A KILL. More or less, we saw them age gracefully and nostalgically over that span of time.

I like Timothy Dalton's James Bond. The films returned to a much harder edged Bond. I liked Dalton's thinking man's no nonsense approach. I liked his approach of taking charge getting the job done as was reminiscent of Lazenby's approach. I prefer THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS of the two that Dalton made, but LICENCE TO KILL is a much better film than first realized and it requires a closer look. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL truly comprise the end of one era as we see many of the filmmakers on those two films end their involvement with the series.

For me, GoldenEye and all the subsequent films up to and including SKYFALL have a different feel and look about them. Of the Pirece Brosnan/Daniel Craig era Bond films I gravitate towards TOMORROW NEVER DIES and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of QUANTUM OF SOLACE. I am interested to see what SKYFALL brings.

When I think of the James Bond series certain things or people come to a nostalgic mind. The music of John Barry, the sets of Ken Adam, Maurice Binder's gun barrel opening and the indelible image of Sean Connery are endearing to me.",1348531200,27,4674,4.505896226415095
5019471,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Received, today. Pre-purchased on Amazon.

There is no point in reviewing the films. You either like them or you don't. You know what they are. The films, together, have 120 hours of special features, so there is enough here to take a couple of weeks of essentially non-stop viewing (with sleep, of course). Most has been released before. There is a bonus disc of new content. As others have said, the non-franchise films are not included and there is no reason to have expected them.

I like the packaging. The discs are divided in two hard-back books, with stills from the films on the opposing pages. There are two discs per page, one disc per film, with a picture of a relevant ""Bond Girl"" next to the release date beside each disc. The two books are slip-cased. It is a classy looking and sturdy package.

I have no trouble removing them from the pages, and have yet to have to touch the surface. None of the ones I received had any fingerprints on them, so I have no idea what the other reviewer is speaking of.",1348531200,402,1017,4.456989247311828

Received Bond 50 and I knew when I took the box from the UPS driver that it was heavier than yesterday's package. It does indeed include the book. These have 007 with a gun and Blu-Ray disc on each. There are no scratches or fingerprints on anything and each disc actually says Blu-Ray. I seriously think what I had yesterday was either a bootlegged copy with cheap DVD discs or a warehouse ""picker"" just sent me the regular DVD edition except it appeared that each DVD ""cover"" or whatever you call it, was bland and only had the title on it and all the DVDs had prints and scratches on them.

Now I get to watch them and will update how well they play on my 47"" 3D LG TV.

9/25/2012
I pre-ordered on September 12 WITH hardcover book. I have the original link that now re-directs to the no book page. That's alright as I will include the original link in my return request.

UNFORTUNATELY, there is no book in the package. Surely there are many people with this problem.

The packaging is as shown, mostly. The flimsy case (on the left) holds the 2 DVD cases that come in it and it is is just a flimsy piece held together with the actual box containing the DVDs1. Most will discard this. You can see how the DVD's fit tightly but there is a small finger hold to slide your finger to get under it to slide the DVD out. This would not be an issue with true Blu-Ray discs. With these, they all had fingerprints and scratches on them and there were scratches on the inside of each of the 2 DVD holders.

Pretty lousy packing; not taking precautions to put the discs in carefully.

How can this possibly be used if it was just released today?

Sending back without playing even 1.

Should they send me a completely new package including book, I will update this review.

They have acknowledged my return and apologized. The CS rep who replied advised that they would investigate what happened and a new one sent immediately.",1348531200,9,2201,4.431761786600497
5019473,5,B006U1J5ZY,"My only beef with this set is the book. I paid the full 180 for this with the book instead if the 150 discounted price that didn't have e book with it. The book is only 70 pages and abridged. The full book is less than 30 bucks and I could have had both if I'd just canceled my order and got the cheaper set and book seperately.

Other than that I have no complaints. The case is sturdy and, with a little practice I can get the discs out of the sleeves unharmed. I like having the slot for Skyfall but don't know if I want to really use it when the film comes out. The movies look excellant in HD. I've already watched all the ones previously available so I am starting with You Only Live Twice and the video quality and sound are first rate.

If you have all the previous Bond Blu-rays sell them to get this set (except for Casino Royale 2disc Blu as it has some features not found here). This is well worth the purchase and a welcome addition to my collection.",1348531200,4,963,4.08994708994709
5019474,1,B006U1J5ZY,"This is a major fail on the part of Fox Home Video. I was all hyped to purchase this set until I saw some unboxing videos of this set and it represents a major fail on the part of FHV because this is the same cheap and shoddy packaging that they used for the Star Wars Complete Saga set. It's too easy for these disks to become scratched and damaged and FHV did nothing to ensure that the quality of these disks would not get damaged.

I gave this review one star because of the cheap packaging. Nice try, Fox Home Video, but we expect quality packaging, not the cheap packaging that's present in this collection.",1348531200,69,613,4.2844827586206895
5019475,5,B006U1J5ZY,"It is a nice set, just much smaller than I thought it would be. The books are very solid and everything is very well made. The pictures in the book are semi-glossy, but not really. You do need to almost actually touch the info side of the Blu-ray disc to get it out of it's holder, I don't really care for that.

Yes, Goldeneye is very heavily DNR'd in some scenes. Mostly it looks decent, however the entire presentation that I skipped through seemed to have a little more DNR than it should have. I'll keep watching, but through each and every chapter that I searched though, there was DNR present. Over-all Goldeneye looks about as good as when I streamed it in HD off of Amazon Instant Watch earlier this year. But the sound is much better! It actually seems like some of the landscape scenes are a little too sharp. Really though, this is probably the best it has ever looked.

Ok, as far as the menu's go, all the original Bonds from Dr. No through Casino Royale have the menu's that the old Blu-ray individual releases had. Quantum of Solice does have the different menu, which was the same as the original Blu-ray individual release.

Over-all this is the best, most complete BOND set ever made. A very nice edition to my box set collection.",1348531200,6,1249,4.469298245614035

5019480,5,B006U1J5ZY,"Well, we are back on the ""better, better, and best"" technology merry-go-round with this latest deluxe release of all 22 official Bond films.  (And yes, as much as I like ""Never Say Never Again"", it's not an official-sanctioned and produced Bond release.  I remember when this film came out in 1983 and I recall seeing interviews that some dude named Kevin McClory was upset that he was not cashing in on the 007 franchise and that he was a co-writer with Ian Fleming for ""Thunderball"".  So, some court granted him the rights to remake ""Thunderball"" under the clever guise of ""Never Say Never Again"" and of course, the big magnet to get butts in the movie theater seats was to bring back Sean Connery as Bond.  And of course, that star status trick worked, as I recall that the theater was packed!)

But, I digress....a few years ago, I purchased the 4 Bond DVD box sets in a Christmas fire sale at Best Buy and I thought to myself, ""Cool!  I have all of the Bond movies on DVD - now I can get rid of my scratchy, old VHS tapes!""  I watched all of the DVDs (in 007 release order, of course!) and I enjoyed all of the extra commentary and cast interviews and I thought that it would never get better than this.

Then, a couple of years ago, came the arrival of Blu-Ray technology and I thought that I was not going to give in and purchase any DVDS on Blu-Ray, especially since the Blu-Ray players at that time were ridiculously expensive.  Then, I saw MGM/UA started releasing ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", and ""Goldfinger"" on Blu-Ray and I almost gave in and purchased ""Goldfinger"".  But, then I started getting suspicious about the intent of MGM/UA's release tactics.  I was going to hold out to see if they released anymore of the films and they rolled out ""Thunderball"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Secret Service"", ""Live And Let Die"" and a few others from the Bond franchise.  BUT, when MGM/UA did not release ""For Your Eyes Only"", ""Octopussy"", and ""A View To A Kill"" from Roger Moore's Bond heyday, then I became especially suspicious and I started putting it all together that 2012 would be the 50th anniversary of Bond films when ""Dr. No"" was released in 1962, so I held out to see if anything major would be released from the studios and I'm delighted that I did!

I did have the opportunity to see ""Goldfinger"" in Blu-Ray from a friend of mine who regrettably purchased the multi-film packs and I will have to admit that the visual and audible effects were stunning!  Watching Goldfinger's all-out assault on Fort Knox was a tremendously enjoyable viewing experience and it was like I had never watched this film before!  Make no mistake about it - I didn't want to plop down $184 for these films, but it's like $8 a Bond film in Blu-Ray no less!  I pre-ordered my Bond set last week from Amazon and I don't regret the purchase one bit.  September 25th could not come soon enough for me and I'll admit that I never purchased any Daniel Craig's Bond DVDs, although I did see the two films in the theater.  (To the fans who are wondering why there is only one empty slot in the forthcoming Blu-Ray set, it's simple: If ""Skyfall"" does not have an awesome box office take and goes the way of ""Quantum of Solace"" a very low-grossing Bond film, then there may not be anymore James Bond movies!)  These films not only have to continue being edgy and impactful, but they have to profitable in order to get any further studio endorsements and budgets.

One last thing to consider in this purchase.....I did purchase this set from Amazon and I'm excited to watch the films in Blu-Ray, but if MGM/UA tries to get cute about it a year or two from now and try to call it something like, ""Never-Before-Seen, ""Super-De-Duper"", ""Extremely Deep Blu-Ray"" Bond films, then I'm afraid, I'll have to cut Mr. Bond's tightrope from a helicopter and let him fall back to Earth because this is one Bond fan who is tired of the movie studio's extortion plots and capers to get more money from us devoted 007 fans!

To date, this is the ultimate Bond set for the ultimate Bond fan, and I am one of those Bond fans.  I grew up watching Bond movies frequently with my dad, and I have caught several Bond marathons in the past on TNT & what have you, and years ago after the release of the 4 DVD collector's sets, my dad actually got them for me, knowing how much I loved Bond, and I have since had many 1-2 week straight Bond movie marathons.  Classics never die, and for me, Bond movies will always hold a special place in my collection.

Now that we're on the brink of this stellar Blu-Ray collection, I am determined to trade up my current Bond sets and get this for my collection.

5019501,5,B006U1J5ZY,"*** A 'PREAMBLE' ON THE FORTHCOMING ""BOND 50"" BLU RAY BOX SET ***

For those who pre-purchase - there are a few details worth noting about this 22-film/23-disc BLU RAY box set as a 'preamble' to its eventual release in late September 2012...

Excluding the two Daniel Craig outings (""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum Of Solace"" which are also in the box) - as of February 2012 there are only 11 of the previous 20 James Bond movies presently on Blu Ray - they are ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"", ""Thunderball"", ""Live And Let Die"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", ""For Your Eyes Only"", ""Moonraker"", ""License To Kill"", ""Die Another Day"" and ""The World Is Not Enough"". [Note: 9 have been officially released in the UK - it appears that ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" and ""Licence To Kill"" are 'EURO' issues - covering in German writing and with no card wraps].

PRINT QUALITY:
The 11 that are out there are 1-disc Blu Ray versions matching exactly the 2DVD ""Ultimate Edition"" issues from 2006. They boast a genuinely beautiful print (a full Lowry Digital Frame-By-Frame Restoration) and each is packed with great extras from the time. Overall - you get hundreds of hours of Bond memories. I've reviewed ""Goldfinger"" and have also raved about ""Live And Let Die"" as examples of how good reissued Blu Ray can be when its done properly. I own the others and although I haven't reviewed them - I've watched them all - and I cannot stress this enough - they're gorgeous in terms of print quality.

So when this Blu Ray box does come out it will make the remaining 9 available for the first time on that format. And given what went before they will be nothing short of spectacular to look at and contain some of the best titles in the franchise - ""You Only Live Twice"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Octopussy"", ""A View To A Kill"", ""The Living Daylights"", ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".

EXTRAS/PACKAGING:
At this point (February 2012) - there is no indications of 'new' bonus material - and if 20th Century Fox had any - you'd imagine they'd advertise it big time and in advance. So we should presume there 'isn't anything new' on this forthcoming box. But - and it's important to note this - the bonus material of the original 2DVD sets that is out there on the 11 already released - and will be on the 9 newly transferred to this box - is 'HUGE'. I mean there's hour and after hour of it - and the vast majority of that bonus material is genuinely informative and entertaining. The picture of the box looks nice, but of course without access to the actual item - we can't assess whether its been done on the cheap-and-naff - or not. Hopefully not (decent booklet please).

It's probably not the smartest move on my part to review a box set that hasn't come out yet (and 8 months in advance) - but at a retail price of a little over four pounds sterling/five dollars US per disc - ""Bond 50"" with its 22 films is still a mouth-watering prospect. And fan-gripes aside - it will surely feature heavily in people's pre-purchase Christmas shopping baskets for 2012. I'm personally hoping that each of the missing titles are reissued individually in the same matching card wraps as the initial releases - so I can match up the spines.

To sum up this preamble - in terms of sheer value for money - ""Bond 50"" is already lining itself up to be a BLU RAY 'Reissue Of The Year' - even before it's released and ""Skyfall"" (Bond 23) gets here in October. There's a lot of hype around this release and for once it may very well be justified...

PS: July 2012 update:
It's now officially announced that there will be 'new' material available in this box set - a whole disc of it to be exact (Disc 23). See Amazon's updated description and photos above.",1330214400,232,3801,4.522561863173217

If you want the complete set, you'll need to buy this one separately. Make sure you don't get the flawed version with the missing footage as detailed in separate reviews of this film.",1327017600,55,346,4.476190476190476

For my part, I just have for sale the only 2 Bond movie that I own. So it will be a great addition to my Blu-Ray collection. I think, that they are classic to consider to view at least one in a life time.",1327017600,6,300,3.703125
5019507,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The Blu Ray editions are basically the Ultimate Editions done in spectacular fashion.  These wonderful movies have never looked better. There is a short bonus disc ON BEING BOND -- Connery is old stuff (the angry old fart refuses to do anything for the role that gave him a career). This collection brings to blu ray the 9 films that were held up from release in this format when MGM filed for bankruptcy: YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, OCTOPUSSY. A VIEW TO A KILL, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, GOLDENEYE & TOMORROW NEVER DIES. They ALL look GREAT in blu ray.  The most successful series of feature films in the history of the movies.  Five decades, six different actors and over several billions tickets sold at over $5 billion dollars.  The dream of Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman has stood the test of time. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig ... NOBODY DOES IT BETTER and this collection brings the greatest hero of the silver screen in the best possible format -- like you have never seen them before.",1326758400,,1137,4.7272727272727275
5019508,5,B006U1J5ZY,"This review is about the item and its value.  To put it simply, if you are going to buy the entire series of James Bond movies and you have a Blu-ray player, this is the bargain to buy.  I have been picking the movies up individually from Amazon for between $9.49 to $9.99 each.  A great deal.  However, if I had known about this offer, I would have gone for the entire collection.  22 movies for $200.00 comes to about $9.10 each!

Each of the individual movies I have seen so far makes the Blu-Ray upgrade well worth it.  The video quality of each is un-surpassed.  Details, only guessed at, are impressive.  The audio of each is, also, incredible.  Each has the DTS HD Master 5.1 plus the original Mono or Dolby Surround soundtrack (there is a depth to Shirley Bassey's ""Moonraker"" openning that I found almost...moving).

I have about a dozen of the individually released movies.  If you can't wait, maybe Amazon will have the others for the price mentioned above.  If you CAN wait, this set is the best deal and well worth it.",1326758400,103,1031,4.478494623655914
5019509,1,B006U1J5ZY,"Tired of these studios ripping us off. If we buy the rights to watch a movie we should have the right to watch it on our 55"" OLED on down to our iphone. It would cost another $200 to download these titles.",1326499200,27,205,3.9047619047619047
5019510,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I am one who refused to buy any James Bond films on Blu-Ray because they were just releasing these stingy little 3-fer box sets and yet you still couldn't get all the James Bond films on Blu-Ray yet.  So, buying only about ten of the only available 007 James Bond discs would definitely prove to be disappointing knowing that a complete box set is inevitable.  Since Dr. No came out exactly 50 years ago so, of course, they are going to release a special 50 year celebration box set of all the James Bond films on to Blu-Ray.

I have over 200 Blu-Ray films and so I'm pleased with myself that I refrained from buying any James Bond Blu-Ray discs because I saw this coming that a major box set was yet to come.  I've been burned before by buying pieces to a collection one by one, and then a complete collection comes out at a majorly lower price later. Well, not this time!

So, bring it on, 007.  To me, it's all or nothing! I await the day to have it all!",1326412800,11,957,4.202185792349726
5019511,5,B006U1J5ZY,"When the boxed set of 3 movies went on sale recently at a major electronics retailer, I should have suspected at that time something was up.  The sets were selling for 19.99 each!  I just could not pass that up so I purchased the first two sets but could not find the third.  And since I have both of Daniel Craig's Bond movies, I don't think I'm willing to spend for this set, I'll just build my Bond collection individually.  So is it safe to say that all Bond titles will be available individually?  I hope so.",1326412800,7,513,4.247422680412371
5019512,5,B006U1J5ZY,"The original David Niven CASINO ROYALE was a spoof, but he WAS James Bond (Sir James Bond).  So comedy or no comedy, that film was a James Bond film. Although a spoof, it kept to the original plot as much as most James Bond films.  That blu-ray will be out on February 7, and if you collect James Bond films you must have it!",1326412800,4,325,4.0625
5019513,4,B006U1J5ZY,"Can someone please tell me why one of my favorite Bond films, ""You Only Live Twice"" is not available by itself on BD? If this is a complete collection, then a BD version must have been created, yet it's not for sale individually. What gives?",1326412800,7,241,4.377777777777778
5019514,5,B006U1J5ZY,"I don't understand why everyone is so bothered by the concept of a complete collection or not. First of all the collection is called Bond 50... It is meant to be a complete collection of the last 50 years of bond. As for any movies that come out after, well if your a big James Bond fan like me then you'll want them to keep on making new films! Right!? Yet I still want the previous great films that made me a fan to begin with! Here is the first 50 years and to hopefully 50 more!!
Besides all that, if we're really going to be as critical as can be... This will be my 4th collection. The first being VHS, then 2 DVD sets and now blu-ray. 10 years from now there will most than likely be a new collection released when blu-ray is topped and then it will have Skyfall and whatever new movies come out. This has been the same continuous situation, new movies, new forms of owning the movies and so new collections! Seriously, everyone should just keep on complaining, would it be better if they just didn't release the movies at all!? Just buy the set like you know you will and be happy!!",1326326400,30,1089,4.215311004784689
5019515,4,B006U1J5ZY,"For those being critical, first MGM was looking at bankruptcy, and that's why the whole Bond series wasn't released yet.  I have all the films available on BD, including Never Say Never Again.  The comments regarding that one and the Peter Sellers Casino Royale movie are ludicrous since 1.  Casino Royale was a spoof movie, and 2.  Never Say Never Again wasn't produced by MGM, but by 20th Century Fox, so MGM of course wouldn't be placing either of those movies in an official box set.

While I have the half+ that are out, at the pre-order price of this box set, I wouldn't be spending much more on it than on buying the remaining, especially if those remaining ones won't be available at under $19.99.  I'd rather not wait till the individual ones start coming out, then wait more till the price drops to $10.",1326326400,62,813,4.534246575342466
5019516,3,B006U1J5ZY,I love the movies and love that they are all finally on blu-ray but they should have done this from the start.  What am I supposed to do with the first three volumes of movies they released earlier????????,1326326400,14,205,4.394736842105263
5019517,1,B006U1J5ZY,"Normally, I wait when it comes to sets this big because they always seem to release one or two, but not all before totally redesigning the packaging and re-releasing a larger set.  However on Bond, they had the 3 packs, which I avoided, but then they started releasing them individually (about half of the series) or so, so I figured it would be a two phase thing.  Of course, no, this time they roaylly screwed me as I have all the ones already available and have been waiting patiently for the second half to be released with favorites like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy... Now this, a complete set with most likely new artwork that will eventually be released individually, but of course, with the newer artwork.  F them, I'm NOT buying.  I already have every Bond film on DVD and they look good enough.",1326326400,38,844,4.532894736842105
5019518,3,B006U1J5ZY,"I'm a longtime Bond fan but these collections can get a bit costly (sure Star Wars and LOTR fans can relate....).
I remember when the entire Bond film series was sold in two collections on VHS to coincide with the release of Goldeneye. Of course, said collection almost instantly becomes incomplete the moment the latest film is released, so then the consumer must rebuy a new collection that includes the new film. How many copies of Dr. No does someone need to own?  Of course, Never Say Never Again is NEVER included...",1326240000,3,522,4.673913043478261

All the discs store away in a nice case.  Some negatives though. Discs can be tricky to get out. And the biggest thing I was disappointed about, NO EXTRAS. That's a HUGE disappointment. No behind the scenes features, no deleted scenes. Nothing. They really blew a great opportunity to give fans a solid must have collection. Why not interview all the Bonds about what it was like working on the film? It would've been great to see a feature on the Bond girls and Villians. I received this DVD set as a gift,and I'm mostly happy with it, but had I known there was no extras,I would've purchased the special editions which have plenty of extras on them.",1522886400,,824,4.316129032258065
