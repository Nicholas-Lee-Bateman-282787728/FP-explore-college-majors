6853857,5,B00Q3E1W6I,The DVD covered what I wanted to know about the Nikon D750 plus a lot more.  After anyone watches this video they should have a better understanding about the camera and also in taking better pictures in general.

6853859,4,B00Q3E1W6I,Awesome video and teaching aid,1424304000,,30,5.2
6853860,5,B00Q3E1W6I,"Loved the thorough lesson on photography for beginners.  The video gave a thorough and well explained 101 lesson on everything about how cameras work, like aperture, shutter speed, etc.  By the time you finish watching this video, you know what every button does on this camera and he adds special tips on focusing and how to create more pleasing portraits.  It's obvious Michael the Maven knows the Nikon D750 really well and he helps you in any possible scenario you'd like to shoot. Highly recommended!",1418774400,11,505,4.91764705882353

8690210,4,B00Q3E1W6I,"Video has been helpful. At times some of the instructions are not as clear as I would expect, but being able to replay them and trying them with the camera has allowed me to work through them until I can figure out how he was able to access some of the settings.  A good product overall!",1483747200,,287,4.125
8690211,4,B00Q3E1W6I,"This is great because the tone of voice is not monotonous, and the menu descriptions are sufficient. One good addition that should replace the ""introductions and fillers"" would perhaps be a chapter called ""Common tasks"".
For example, ""How to spot meter and lock"", ""How to quickly take a good outdoors portrait"" etc. Sometimes we need those ""quick recipes"", which also help in understanding the role of the independent ingredients after we' ve cooked something.
Waiting for the D810 course.",1480550400,,489,5.2025316455696204
