885977,5,6304441045,"Thought this DVD was good. I'm an animation enthusiast/hobbyist at heart, so my world is one of pure aspiration ;)It is very inspirational as it shows a lot of the ""lesser known"" artists from around the world, many of them doing these productions all on there own.  Worth having in your DVD library!",1254787200,2,299,4.6415094339622645
885978,3,6304441045,"The moment I saw this, I had to have it, thinking it was the DVD'd VHS video a friend showed me about 10 years ago.  It turned out to be different, but the two animations that I really wanted (The Cat Came Back and The Big Snit) are here.

Two of three stars are for those two alone.  The Cat Came Back is hilarious, and the laugh out loud ""What the...????"" element during the railroad part (I won't spoil what it is) adds a tinge of random out-there silliness.

The Big Snit is best appreciated for it's truly bizarre, quiet comedy.  As the Amazon review says, it's like a Far Side cartoon brought to life.  Weird, quirky, and at the very end, even poignant.

As for the rest, they get the final star as a group, because none of them are really that funny, but do have some artistic merit.  Yes, they are mildly interesting, but that's about it.  ""Get a Job"" is a nice throwback to classic Disney and pre-Disney animation.  But again, it didn't make me laugh, only smile once or twice.  ""Black Fly"" was simply stupid.  I don't feel compelled to watch any of them again, unlike the first two I mention, which you can watch again and again.",1179878400,,1139,4.320754716981132
885979,5,6304441045,"If your looking for awesome CG effects, recognizable voice actors, and safe entertainment for all, then this DVD is not for you...but if your looking for something edgy, nostalgic perhaps, and above all, original, executive-free story writing, then look no further.",1135296000,2,265,5.487804878048781
885980,5,6304441045,"This disk has eight wonderful little tales from the Canadian Film Board.  Many styles of animation are used and there is some good music (The Cat Came Back, Blackfly, Get a Job).  The stories included are as follows:
The Cat Came Back - An elderly man finds a cut kitten with a destructive nature.  He spends the film trying to get rid of the cat.  Great song.
The Big Snit - A bizarre husband and wife begin to feud with one another but even global nuclear war cannot stop their love from shining through.
The Lump - A very short man becomes popular when he grows a lump on top of his head that looks like a handsome head.  Then he learns that popularity is not all it's cracked up to be.
Getting Started - A pianist spends the afternoon procrastinating practicing a piece.
Juke Bar - Live action and claymation tell of a diner owner's unique solution to a roach infestation.
Get A Job - Two stories on one as the main story is mirrored on a soap opera.  The trials of job hunting.
Blackfly - A wonderful animation of Wade Hemsworth's song about working on the Little Abitibi in Ontario and the local pest.
Special Delivery - A really bizarre sequence of events that happen when a husband refuses to clean the snow and ice from his front steps.
While these stories were not originally intended for little children there is no sex or nudity in these films.  The little violence that does exist is similar to a Warner Brothers Looney Tune.
I saw no indication of the poor print quality mentioned by an earlier reviewer.",1078358400,4,1518,4.438848920863309
885981,5,6304441045,"This is a wonderful collection.
I can't think of a finer compilation for someone interested in exploring the diverse uses of animation (defintely non-Disney, thank God) and adult always in theme and occassionally frontal nudity (a couple very brief seconds in ""Special Delivery"") and this is most assuredly not porn (soft or hard.) But what happens in some of these classics may be bit too harsh for children or outside their understanding. Parents or guardians should decide for themselves.
(1) I consider ""Special Delivery"" a masterpiece. A murder ( that is not at all murder) that is a very incisive take on hypocrisy and immorality (or is that amorality.) A sterling example of how a ""cartoon"" can do a lot more than get an hysterical laugh out of you. It's black-humor, will probaby give most anyone a knowing smile, chuckle or roar.
(2)""Getting Started"" is one of Richard Condie's first films and another masterpiecce. Condie seems incapable of not making a masterpiece. His take on everyday delusions of grandeur and reality is a charmer with his wonderful off-center sense of humor. Beautifully animated and executed. Once you adjust to Condie's humor and style, you'll be coming back for more. This is original individualist creation at its best.
(3) ""The Big Snit"" is another Condie masterpiece of a much higher order. Here Condie makes a statement on the unthinkable that is hilarious until literally the end. This isn't one of the best animated films, it belongs in the company of the greatest films ever made. Condie is an absurdist in the W.C. Fields tradition. The couple in this at first seem unreal, but their bizarre eccentricities make them somehow, more realistic, believable and, even, lovable, while maintaining a giddy swipe at ""normalcy.
(4)""Get A Job"" is an exceedingly entertaining and probably successful effort using rock 'n roll to show how to do what the title and classic song demand. With plenty of bright, almost Looney-Toonish animation, it is just plain fun to watch and delievers it's message without bludgeoning. Would that all public service messages were this kewl and knowing. A classic.
(5) ""The Cat Came Back"" is a film I had heard about for years, and I was afraid it wouldn't live up to its praise. It more than lived up to the kudos it has justly received. It is about a guy, who makes the mistake of taking in a cat on his doorstep and comes to,uh, regret it. He keeps tossing out the cat. The cat returns and as only a cat can demolishes the guys house and life. Never has there been such sunny black humor. This is as funny as the best Loony Tunes and better than the average. Pure gold with an ending that makes it a gem. Masterpiece every moment of the way.
(6) ""Juke Bar"" combines live action with animation as cockroaches live it up in a newly delivered old-style juke box to a greasy spoon hot dog joint. The fancifully conceived and animated roaches turn the juke box into a bar. And then the partying begins. A colorful delight. But all parties must end and this one has a first-rate double surprise ending. Actually, not surprising if you've ever battled the little SOBs. Great character animation. A classic.
(7) ""Blackfly"" is an animation based on a song written by the Canadian who wrote and sings about his experiences as a lumberjack. Another classic. After 6 and 7, you may feel like scratching.
(8) ""The Lump"" is a cautionary fable on wanting everything to look perfect and how insisting on perfection that is cosmetic show can lead to disaster, i.e. seeing only the beauty and not the reality, which is spun to look beautiful. Another masterpiece to make one contemplate a very real blind-spot in all of us. More relevant than ever in today's unbelievably corrupt new regime of politicians
If you are a mature (in all ways) adult, this is a good one for taking a peek at ""alternative"" animation and its riches--artstic and content.",1037232000,39,3895,4.789004457652303
885982,1,6304441045,"The animations on this disk can be had on the ""super jewelcase"" version of this disk.  The video transfer on this particular disk is awful.  Buy the DVD with the guy in the red spiral on the cover, the animations are the same, but the video transfer is far superior.",1022544000,10,266,4.3
885983,4,6304441045,"I don't know why this DVD is getting hard to find all of a sudden. My copy arrived today, but it looks like you can no longer order it.
 First off, this DVD isn't really for American kids. With that in mind, please read the following review. Anyway, this is a more entertaining selection of National Film Board of Canada animated shorts than the Leonard Maltin Animation Favorites DVD. The Maltin selections were good too but too arty for the average viewer (I nearly fell asleep throughout ""Pas de Deux"" on that video).
In ""Animation Greats!"" we see a variety of crowd pleasers, beginning with the surprising ""Special Delivery"" and ending with ""Blackfly"", an animated adaptation of a Canadian folk song. True, there is still ""The Lump"" after that one, but ""The Lump"" is just so STUPID and boring. An overlong pixilation/collage short with unappealing characters.
The thing about this DVD is that unlike a lot of short film collections, the ratio of actual GOOD shorts is higher. The best ones are ""Special Delivery"", Richard Condie's ""Getting started"" (which is also on the Maltin DVD but the sound is better on this print), ""The big snit"" (also by Condie, an amazing display of Condie's unique humour), the rarely-seen, albeit excellent musical comedy ""Get a Job"" starring Bob Dog...and of course, ""The Cat Came Back"" which seems to be in nearly every single compilation of NFB shorts (It's on the Maltin DVD as well as on any number of past, present and future compilations).
The only shorts I had no love for were ""The Lump"" and ""Juke Bar"", a pre-""Joe's Apartment"" cockroach-infested stop-motion escapade. It just wasn't funny enough. Overall I recommend getting this if you plan on watching the cartoons with friends, and the Leonard Maltin DVD if you want some beautiful visuals.
This would've got 5 stars from me if they replaced ""The Lump"" with McLaren's ""Neighbours"" and ""Juke Bar"" with ""What on Earth"".",999820800,13,1912,4.883076923076923
885984,5,6304441045,"Many of these animation shorts are among the best from the past 25 years.  The video transfer is very good, but they all have an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  Worth getting just for The Cat Came Back.",961804800,6,195,4.243243243243243

7872458,2,6304441045,"The art of creative animation has vastly outstripped the best efforts of the single individual working (almost) alone.
It is quite unfair to compare work of this calibre with the wonders produced by the major studios like Pixar, Studio Ghibli, Aardman, or Dreamworks.
I'm afraid I have come to expect miracles, and these pieces look dated to me. I'm sorry to say that what was once magical seems earthbound and obvious and it is only the rare genius who is able to rise above the technical limits that operate at this scale.

Arrived fast, in perfect condition.

Very affordable.

This DVD contained several different animators 1 of which was why I purchased the disc.
The Big Snit and The Cat Came Back have been my favorite for years, but I was unable to find it.

I bought the disc knowing that I might only like those 2 shorts, but the others were very good as well.

Glad I finally got it on DVD.  I would recommend it if you like creative animation, especially the two that I formentioned.

Cons:

None.",1289347200,,490,4.426966292134831
