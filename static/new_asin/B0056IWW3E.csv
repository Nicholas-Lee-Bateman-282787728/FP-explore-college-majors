8459677,4,B0056IWW3E,"An educating documentary that follows author and explorer Piers Gibbon, as he heads into the rainforests of Papua New Guinea to meet tribesmen who have tasted the flesh of humans. He'll question them about the methods the used and the reasons they did what the did, He will pull back the veil of taboo and give us a glimpse into the lives of these tribes people. All of this culminates with Piers sitting down and having a meal with the cannibals.

I found this extremely entertaining and educational, and is what I have come to expect from documentaries from National Geographic.

I should mention, that while it doesn't bother me, some people may wish to know, the documentary does contain ""Tribal nudity"", however that should be expected from a documentary like this. It also shows the killing of a pig, but again, considering the topic, this should be expected.",1384041600,,865,4.798657718120805
