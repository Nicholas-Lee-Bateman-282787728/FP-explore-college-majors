1362422,4,B00004W5XP,"The eighteenth season of Dr. Who is the best of all Dr. Who in my personal  opinion. What more could you want, Tom Baker and Lalla Ward perfect  chemistry as the Doctor and Romana and K9 played by John Leeson.  I have  watched State of Decay(E-space story2) so many times I have it memorized.  I first watched it when I was 8 or ten or something(when it was actually  broadcast.  Then in High school I recorded it on a low-quality VCR.  It is  still enchanting to watch.  And now I have the other two stories after a  ten year agonizing wait.  Warrior's Gate is also good and very surreal.  These are what Sci-fi stories should be.  Shows like State of Decay and  Warrior's Gate are more than just rocketships and ray guns.  Seemingly  'fantasy' elements have a science to them as well.  Tom Baker has always  tried to be involved in the scripts and it shows in all of his work.  These  are his more serious shows but they continue to have the light humor of Tom  Baker's Doctor injected into them. A good balance.  You want to be really  serious try Peter Davison, a bit too much so for my taste though.  Tom  Baker is many things in the E-Space Trilogy, not just silly like in  previous seasons. But there is that as well if you like that.",965433600,17,1241,4.3056768558951966
1362463,5,B00004W5XP,"This is a great classic collection of the 4th (and most iconic) Doctor. Here's some feedback:
1. Adric is introduced in Full Circle, the first of the 3 E-Space stories.
2. State of Decay is a great vampire story painting some rich Timelord history.
3. All 3 stories include Romana as a companion.
4. All 3 stories include K-9 as a companion.
5. Warrior's Gate sees the departure of Romana and K-9 as companions.
6. These stories are getting close to the end of the 4th Doctor's tenure.
7. Tom Baker is great as the Doctor, but you can feel he's tiring. Tom Baker is wearing his maroon color schemed outfit in these stories.",1500422400,,623,4.473684210526316

1362467,5,B00004W5XP,"I originally gave this product 3 out of 5 stars. and I said this 'While this trilogy does give some great moments, it also has some bad moments too. I like full circle a lot actually.  I think it's a great story and I love the creation of E-space.  with warriors gate, I definitely like most of it.  however, I admit, except for a couple parts, I really did not like state of decay.  I actually didn't even like looking at it when I watched it, bc it just felt ugly to watch.  of course that's my preference and I know others would disagree with me, but I can't help it.  in fact, the episode from new who called 'vampires in venice', that gets a lot of hate bc it didn't have real vampires in it.  however, I prefer watching that a lot more than state of decay.  this is still worth viewing, bc u might think differently than me.'

Well, I've rewatched it, and I went from liking full circle a lot to LOVING IT.  literally, it's a great perfect story in my opinion.
state of decay was the one where I had the most change upon re-watching.  as u can see, I didn't really like this one.  it was just ugly to look at sometimes, to me.  however, once I re-watched it, it was very good.  I give it 4/5 stars now.
warrior's gate was still very good to me and it had a lot of awesomeness to it.  overall, this trilogy is actually very good, and the creation of E-Space is one of the best ideas of the fourth doctor era.

yet if I had to rate them and give them a grade, it would be this.
full circle: 5 out of 5 stars.
state of decay: 4 out of 5 stars
warriors gate: 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1494720000,3,1580,4.016025641025641

1362646,4,B00004W5XP,"The modern incarnation of ""Doctor Who"" is known for having elaborate seasonal story arcs, slowly building to something epic and grand. But the old series had its fair share of story arcs as well, where multiple serials were tied together in some kind of quest.

One good example is the ""E-Space Trilogy,"" which brings together the Fourth Doctor serials ""Full Circle,"" ""State of Decay"" and ""Warrior's Gate."" These are fairly solid adventures in a parallel dimension no less strange than ours, with everything from slavers to the Creatures From The Black Lagoon to space vampires -- and the biggest problem is that the Doctor ends up losing the competent and warm-hearted Romana in favor of a useless, treacherous little brat.

""Full Circle"": The TARDIS is dragged onto a completely unfamiliar planet, despite its equipment declaring that this is definitely Gallifrey. The Doctor (Tom Baker) and Romana (Laila Ward) quickly figure out that they have somehow entered E-space, a small universe existing alongside ours. Unfortunately, they don't know how to get back.

And of course, they immediately become embroiled in local affairs. The Alzarians, the people of this planet, dwell near a vast colony ship, and whenever Mistfall comes upon the planet, they all hide from the toxic gases and giant spiders... except the real problem is the amphibious Marsh-men, not the mist. The Doctor begins investigating this oddly perfectionist, unquestioning society, slowly discovering a secret that not even they are entirely aware of -- but since Romana has been bitten by a giant terrifying spider, she is being mind-controlled into helping the Marsh-men.

""State of Decay"" brings the Doctor, Romana, K-9 and the stowaway Adric (Matthew Waterhouse) to a planet with a sort of generic medieval society, where technology and science are deemed heretical. Not to religion, mind, but to the three terrifying lords of the planet -- Zargo, Camilla and Aukon -- who regularly cause young people to vanish from surrounding towns. As the Doctor tries to figure out what caused this ""state of decay,"" he finds that the answer is both simpler and weirder than you'd expect: vampires!

In ""Warrior's Gate,"" the TARDIS appears in a strange black expanse, where E-space and normal space intersect. The only other creatures there are a slave ship whose crew immediately kidnap Romana so she can be their new slave navigator, and the Doctor finds a stone gateway in the nothingness. Unfortunately, K-9 is malfunctioning due to the null space, and mysterious teleporting cat-people are appearing and vanishing throughout the ship and the gateway. Will the Doctor and his friends ever make it back?

The stories of ""The E-Space Trilogy"" technically didn't need to be set in a different universe -- the adventures in this strange unknown place aren't much weirder than the Doctor's regular adventures. But the unfamiliar setting does provide a certain sense of mystery and suspense, since very little of what the Doctor encounters is familiar to him. Sure, there are a lot of humans rattling around E-Space, and one of the villains is from our universe... but the planets he comes to and the strange problems of null space are entirely new.

And in the midst of trying to extricate themselves from E-space, the Doctor keeps stumbling across injustices that need to be righted, and civilizations threatened by mysterious alien forces -- we've got slave ships, a crumbling castle with vampires, and a vast swamp outside an oddly geological spaceship. And though some of the Doctor's quirky humor is here (he tries to figure out if he can stick a riverfruit in his pocket), the tone tends to be rather serious overall.

""Warrior's Gate"" is perhaps the weakest of the three, being rather repetitive at times (with Romana being kidnapped multiple times). But it's also slightly bittersweet, as this marks Romana's departure from the series -- and it's suitably built up to, with her becoming more rebellious and less eager to go back to Gallifrey. She's lived life as the Doctor does, and is unwilling to be anything else now.

The biggest problem with this trilogy? Adric. This character is one of the most insufferable characters in TV history. In every single episode of these three serials, he spends his time either being useless (usually whining or trumpeting his math skills) or a vile little coward who shrugs off the forthcoming murder of Romana because (paraphrased) ""Hey, at least I'LL be okay!""

The lost-in-another-universe arc stays around just long enough to be interesting, without ever overstaying its welcome -- and the one-off adventures of ""Doctor Who: The E-Space Trilogy"" are entertaining, serious sci-fi, marred only by the dreadful new companion Adric.",1433203200,,4741,5.121604139715394

The second story in the trilogy is a gothic horror story involving vampires, nuff said ;) The third story to end the trilogy is definetly the most surreal.

1362688,4,B00004W5XP,"After a somewhat dull opening story in the Leisure, and the truly bad Meglos, this series of three stories serves as a high point for John Nathan Turner's first Season as showrunner. The arch features the departure of Romana and K-9, and most importantly the Introduction of Adric as companion.

The first story, Full Circle has the TARDIS trapped in another universe in E-space. They land on a strange planet where the focus of life is on ""avoiding mistfall"" and constantly repairing a ship so that they one day might launch it. It's a cool concept and despite the fact that the ending has some jaw droppingly stupid logic, it was the best story of the season yet.

State of Decay has the Doctor and Romana landing on another planet in E-space where Vampires have taken over and ruled for a thousand years plunging the native civilization into ignorance. The piece is scary and atmospheric, it gives some nice back story on the Time Lords, and is an enjoyable story despite a few plot contrivances at the end and a somewhat redundant search for a message from Rassilon.

Warrior's Gate's the crown jewel and really makes the whole journey through E-space worthwhile as  we reach a remarkable place that's on the border of E-space and N-space with a mysterious race and some of the most fascinating concepts of the Fourth Doctor's run. There are some amazing shots and twists along the way making this one of the best stories of the Baker era.

Second, the '80s style special effects and music were a bit nostalgic for me. The plots of all three stories were quite interesting. Adric's character was a bit inconsistent at times, but I still enjoyed him. Romana, alas, did get damselled a lot, but she made up for it with strength of character.

1362754,5,B00004W5XP,"An excellent trilogy from the early 80s renaissance of Doctor Who. These three stories have a loose thematic arc involving shipwrecks, cargo cults, the implications of colonialism, imperialism and the arc of history, wedded to the same far-out science fiction concepts and witty humor that always made the show such a treat.

FULL CIRCLE - The TARDIS becomes stranded in a pocket universe, and lands on a planet where evolution is in overdrive. Another stranded ship, full of humanoids, live in fear of the native Marshmen...but neither colonists nor natives are quite what they seem. An under-rated story full of intriguing notions, and the first appearance of controversial companion Adric. Guest starring George Baker (I, Claudius)

STATE OF DECAY - The Doctor and Romana, now accompanied by a stowaway Adric, find themselves on a quasi-Medieval planet where an impoverished population is kept in ignorance and fear by a trio of ageless despots who quite literally suck the lifeblood out of their subjects. But behind their cruelty lies an ancient menace from the legends of the Doctor's own people. A very atmospheric story with great costumes and production design.

WARRIOR'S GATE - The masterpiece of the trilogy finds the TARDIS stranded in a white void between the two universes, where a slave-ship full of time-sensitive aliens is also adrift. With evocative sets and music and surreal imagery that evokes Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, this is a timey-wimey tale of empires lost and won, masters becoming slaves, and everyone finding a way out of the cycle of history with the help of Romana and K9, who leave the series with this story. Plus, a great big explosion at the end. Who could ask for more?",1384387200,27,1713,5.024647887323944

1362779,5,B00004W5XP,"And just like the Alzarains, the Doctor goes full circle a lot to. This trilogy starts with the dullest of the three stories in Full Circle. The plot in the story is rather well conceived but there is relatively no movement.
  Things get better with State of Decay, a story penned several years back by Terrance Dicks but was put on hold because its slated season 15 appearance would have been at the same time as the debut of Dracula. So after a couple of seasons, it was slated into season 18. This story is noticeable not only for its good plot, but it is probably Lalla Ward's best story as Romana. As a side note, this story has a good book off of it called Blood Harvest, also written by the Terrance Dicks as a part of the seventh Doctor line.
  Warrior's Gate is one of Doctor Who's best true sci-fi stories, with other time travelling creatures and slave traders. The story comes off as a bit strange but the plot gets better on repeat veiwing. Romana gets more to do than the Doctor in this story and her exit seems to be the perfect scenario for a spin-off series.
  Overall I would give Full Circle a C+, State of Decay an A, and Warrior's Gate a B+ or A-. The set has good extras highlighted by a goofy look at Lalla's Wardrobe featuring past and current costume designers from the show and Lalla herself. Overall I would give this set eight and one half stars out of ten.",1301184000,3,1385,4.3076923076923075
1362780,2,B00004W5XP,"The extras are very informative, and the reduced price is good, since you're getting three stories in the box set.  It's worth getting if only to see for yourself why so many people detest the character of Adric.  Adric, who pushes his father-figure into the marsh, then stands there and lets him flail around for a while before trying (unsuccessfully) to pull him out.  Adric, who lies, steals, and sides with whoever seems to be in position to help him more.  Adric, who wants to join the teen gang,  but reminds them he's elite, and has a math excellence badge to prove it.  Adric the unloved, clumsy kid in the clown suit.

Full Circle was written by a fanboy -- a gifted 17-year-old, but a fanboy, nonetheless. Hence, we get Adric, the angst-filled misunderstood teen.  If only JNT had taken the high road and killed off Adric at the end, in place of Varsh -- then Adric would be fondly remembered as a kid with such potential... Or perhaps they could have left Adric to pilot the starliner, since he's obviously the smartest one on the ship.  But no -- JNT inflicts Adric upon Tom Baker and Lalla Ward for the rest of the season, then makes Peter Davison inherit the mess.

Full Circle has some great elements -- but the cheesy incidental music, ridiculous yellow Peter Pan costumes, and plethora of guest stars aren't among them.  The Doctor and Romana are able to immediately identify and fix the problem -- but since their screen time is drastically shortened to accommodate all the sub-plots (Adric and his issues, Logan's rise to leadership, the stagnant civilization of the Alzarian sheeple), the end seems rather forced.

This story would have been better served with Logan as the main guest star, focusing on his rise to leadership. Adric should have been simply one of the tragic friends of Logan's daughter, contrasting the bravery and decision-making ability of the youngsters in sharp contrast with the paralysis of the Deciders and Alzarian adults.

Oh well.  It's part of the JNT era.  Hence, much color, much disco music, and way too much ensemble cast.",1295913600,2,2074,4.754189944134078

Tolkien observed about creating a good story, ""it grows like a seed in the dark out of the leaf-mould of the mind"" (Carpenter 1977:131).

This follows the footsteps of John Nathan-Turner. As destructive as a maddened Dalek, JNT nixed the score and moved to Disco-Doctor music that sappily sucked the juice out of the narrative. Rather than let the Doctor evolve organically out of creative compost and forceful acting, producers can suddenly run amuck in the desire to make their ""mark."" This trilogy reveals the recipe book for the unsavory fare foisted on fans during the 1980s and 90s. Only when Russell T. Davies rescued Doctor Who, in 2005, did we return to the heroic space epic rife with U.K. flavoured galactic eccentricity.

He left just in time, replete with only two special JNT question-marks donning his unfortunate lapels. The only story that Bidmead didn't totally ruin is Terrance's vampiric ""State of Decay.""

JNT replaced the trickster Baker with a compliant young actor (poor Davison), and then dressed him up in a cricket-player slash ice-cream salesman outfit, replete with a fake-eccentric piece of celery on his lapel, along with question-marks.

1362824,4,B00004W5XP,"I am strictly a Nu Who fan. So, take this opinion with a grain of salt...

Contrary to other reviewers, I like ""Full Circle"" the most of the 3 serials. The concept of E-Space is a cool one; the visit to Adric's planet breathes life into a miniature universe teeming with people unaware of our own. I don't mind Adric as much as others do. His persistent idiocy definitely grates, but Matthew Waterhouse seems confident around the likes of Tom Baker and it's hard not to admire his serene self-importance. Moreover, Adric represented a first step toward Peter Davison's tenure, during which the Doctor travels with numerous companions and it becomes more like an ensemble show.

""State of Decay"" and ""Warrior's Gate"" didn't impress me much, despite the presence of Lalla Ward (who made ""City of Death"" so endearing). Tom Baker looks haggard and bored, and barely glances at his co-stars whilst talking to them. Lalla Ward's barely-concealed distaste toward Baker comes through loud and clear, though it works in the story's context. As much as I like Romana, it was wise of her to quit when she did; having two goofy, inscrutable aliens on the TARDIS set is redundant.

If I were to rate the other two serials, I would put Warrior's Gate's story over State of Decay's, which is a total bore and doesn't do anything with the E-Space setting. It's not a good sign when you enjoy the commentary track more than the actual epsiode.",1273190400,,1426,4.741935483870968
1362825,5,B00004W5XP,"What else needs to be said?  It's absolutely classic and if you're a Dr. Who fan, it's a must-have that ranks just behind the Key To Time series.  We pick up Adric (Matthew Waterhouse) and unfortunately lose Romana and K9 who stay behind in E-Space.

As far as the stories themselves go, Warrior's Gate is by far the best and one of the top Dr. Who stories of the Tom Baker era.  The other two are good but not among the best plots, IMHO.

In Full Circle, the Tardis is sucked into E-Space (Exo-Space), an alternate universe, through a Charged Vacuum Emboitment (CVE) whatever that is! :)  We learn where the CVE's came from in Logopolis, Tom's final story.  E-Space is a universe without a lot of stars and the Tardis lands on Alzarius where they find a crashed ship with a population of people who are actively engaged in repairing the ship.  Adric is one of the young people on board and someone with advanced mathematical abilities.  We later find out that the ship has been there for generations and the ""crew"" are afraid to attempt a takeoff because the original pilots are long since dead.  The leaders keep secret the fact that the ship is ready to go and have everyone constantly repairing it.  A major aspect of the plot is the relationship of the crew to the indigenous creatures on the planet.  But you have to watch it.  At any rate the Doctor solves the mysteries and helps them finally take off.  Adric stows away on the Tardis.  This is another excellent Tom Baker story.

But the Tardis is stuck in E-Space with no apparent way to get back to N-Space!

In State of Decay, the Tardis lands on a world near a small village.  The villagers fear the rulers who live in a nearby castle.  It turns out that the castle is actually an ancient space ship from Earth and the rulers are actually the original officers of the ship, kept alive because they were turned into vampires by a giant vampire.  This giant is a creature from the lore of ancient Gallifrey.  The Time Lords had once battled the race of vampires and drove the leader into E-Space.  The Doctor defeats the vampire, freeing the villagers.  The Doctor, Romana, and now Adric, leave the planet.  Personally, I never like stories about blood thirsty vampires so this one is not my favorite.  Nevertheless, like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" it's part of the storyline and leads into the next story, Warrior's Gate.

In Warrior's Gate the Tardis becomes stuck in a rift between the two universes.  It turns out that there is another vessel also stuck in the rift and this vessel contains a load of slave Tharils, a race to time sensitive, leonine people.  Tharils are used to navigate through the timelines and are considered a valuable commodity.  In order to keep the Tharils contained on the ship, its hull had to be made from a dwarf star alloy which means the ship had incredibly high mass.  In the center of the rift is a structure, a building, and the Doctor realizes it contains a gateway to N-Space.  But since the slaver ship is so massive, it starts contracting the space around the gate, precipitating a crisis.  The Doctor discovers that the Tharils were once a dominant and tyrannical race who have now been reduced to slavery.  One Tharil named Biroc helps the Doctor learn the truth about the Tharils and how to pass through the gate back into N-Space.  Meanwhile the slave ship, in desperation to escape the rift and its imminent collapse, turns the ship's engines on the gateway hoping to use the back blast to open it.  But instead the back blast destroys the ship allowing the enslaved Tharils to escape.  Romana elects to stay behind in order to help the Tharils and the Doctor gives her K9 to help her in the effort.  Just before passing through the gateway the Doctor calls out ""You were the best Romana"".  With absolutely no offense to Mary Tamm, the first Romana, Lalla Ward was certainly a terrific Romana.  Of course, two months later Baker and Ward were married but unfortunately the marriage didn't last.

All the while inside the TARDIS they have inadvertanly travled through a CVE into E-Space.  Finding themselves on a strange planet that while the TARDIS screen shows Gallifry has a jungle in its place.  They soon find a small settlement of people living and working around a vast starship.  Along the way they meet a very talneted young man who goes by the name of Adric.  Soon enough strange mists begin to come in from the marshes and the people have to make thier way to the starliner to avoid dying from the mists.  Oddly enough marsh creatures begin to come from the depths and make for land.  Can the Doctor figure out what the marsh creatures have to do with the settlement and the starliner?  Or will the Doctor and Romana become trapped in E-Space forever?

On the very fringe of the TARDIS scanners they find one planet.  Soon enough they land only to discover a medival like society in which the peasents are lorded over by a king and queen alongside thier chamberlian.  But not all seems to be as it is.  The very castel resembles a spaceship.  They peasents know nothing of the outside world or anything else beyond the village.  Bats haunt the land as if waiting for something to return.  The Doctor dreads that an old galliferian legend may have some truth to it.  Worse still young Adric has stowed away on the TARDIS and stumbled into the clutches of the lords of the castle.  Can the Doctor and Romana figure out what is happening or shall he become something far, far worse happen to them?
  The final epsiodes entitled ""Warriors' Gate"" find The Doctor, Romana and Adric at the very end of E-Space.  Stragner still they encounter a strange lion like man who claims they need his help before he hijacks the TARDIS and sends them to where he is.  Thier they find a ship manned by a mad Captain and his crew some are tired of trying to leave others want to jetison the cargo.  Others just want to go home.  The captain won't let that happen.

1362852,5,B00004W5XP,"...these three episodes are some of my favorites from the Tom Baker era. They were shown here in the US just as my personal enthusiasm for the show was reaching its peak and cemented my loyalty to the show for all time. They're very well written episodes and classics of the classic series.

Episode One, Full Circle, finds the Doctor, Romana and K9 in E-Space, or exo-space, outside of the normal space-time continuum of N-Space, or normal space. It introduces a new companion, Adric, who ultimately stows away aboard the TARDIS and joins the team. It's an episode that is somewhat circular in its presentation of the evolution of a species, and how the truth of origin can be lost over the course of generations. It also shows the Doctor in a sort of surrogate father role to a Marshmen youth, with some excellent one-liners from Tom Baker and poor K9's head used in a myriad of unsightly ways. The Marshmen costumes are ghastly, but the story is nicely done.

Episode Two, State of Decay, brings the element of horror to the show for the first time, introducing a vampire-like being, long thought defeated by the Time Lords, but who escaped into E-Space to avoid total annihilation, whose human servants lord over a sort of medieval, serf-like colony. There's an inkling as well, of a genuine affection between the Doctor and Romana that's really quite sweet. Then there's blood, bats, planet/life-sucking creatures of immense power, and a directive from Rassilon and the ancients of Gallifrey. What more could you ask for?

Episode Three, Warriors' Gate, is the final episode in this trilogy, and is a sort of avant-garde offering, with abstract, visceral imagery that is very dream-like and disturbing at times, as it shifts from past to present in the story of the Tharils, walkers between the universes, and heralds the departure of Romana.

Again, these three episodes are very well written stories with a depth that waned, unfortunately, as the era of John Nathan-Turner progressed, but which show Tom Baker at his best as the fourth incarnation of our favorite Time Lord. They are a must have for any Whovian's DVD library.",1241481600,,2133,4.867768595041323
1362853,5,B00004W5XP,"These Classic Who stories from the Tom Baker years stand up well on their own,

(I'd give each story 3 1/2 - 4 stars - the main weakness for me being the character of Adric - although I'd take the character of Adric over the character of Peri, of the Peter Davidson and Colin Baker eras, any day),

but what makes this set really shine are the extras. Elsewhere on the web you can find folks enjoying or dissing various aspects of these extras, but I enjoyed them all (having watched the region 2 releases.)

My one main disappointment with this set is the absence of Tom Baker in the Commentaries or interviews.

1362854,4,B00004W5XP,"This is certainly a wild adventure. The Doctor and Romana are on their way back to Gallifrey when they encounter some kind of anomaly that sucks the TARDIS into another realm, E-Space. Now they find themselves trapped with seemingly no way out. Trying to escape this other universe, the Doctor and Romana have many exciting adventures involving a group of stranded space colonists and deadly marsh men in ""Full Circle"", a group of intergalactic vampires who threaten not only this universe, but both universes in ""State of Decay"", and finally you have a slave ship run by a group of ruthless humans who have found a way to inslave an inter-dimensional species in ""Warriors' Gate"". And in their travels, they encounter a young new companion named Adric who is native to E-Space. It's great fun! The only sad thing is that at the end of ""Warriors' Gate"" we see the departure of two beloved companions, Romana and K9. Goodbye lovely Romana. And goodbye you faithful tin dog whose ""a dead-shot with a nose laser"".

""Full Circle"" gets five stars from me while ""State of Decay"" and ""Warriors' Gate"" gets four. In all, ""The E-Space Trilogy"" is truely epic and is highly recommended!",1233792000,,1175,4.816831683168317
1362855,5,B00004W5XP,"The knew they would come round to releasing the e-space trilogy.  It was a good quality set of stories and well produced(though JNT was inferior post Tom Baker's departer).  My childhood memories are built on these three more than the others though most of the second half of TB and Romana, MT, LW were my Doctor Who EXP as a child of the 70s/80's in my pre and early teens.  If you want good quality tales, celebrity quality acting, and a good main cast topped off with keen special effects(for the time) as well as and etheric and subtle muzak(Paddy Kingsland radiophonics) and atmospheric lighting/sets, then this is your verse, E-space.  I do not yet know what features the DVD set have but I am reviewing the show because I watched it countless times(State of Decay) on my VHS recording I made in highschool and I am accurate in the point of the DVD, the story, because can be!",1233619200,,882,4.528301886792453

Warriors Gate(4.5 stars) is very very good and Full Circle(4 stars) is entertaining. All three together make an excellent trilogy.

The Doctor and Romana get pulled into in E-Space along with K-9. they have difficulty getting out! Things just are not the same in E-Space!

This VHS set was selling for over $100 a few years ago and was almost impossible to find new, because it has been out of print for a long time. BBC made a wise choice in bringing this one time rarity to DVD. Again a must see!",1232928000,,656,4.32520325203252
1362857,5,B00004W5XP,"""One good solid hope's worth a cart-load of certainties..."" well, any fan worth their salt will certainly want this set...

The on-again-off-again blocks of tight continuity and multi-episode story arcs of the new Doctor Who series has already primed fans for the return of this string of CLASSIC Doctor Who stories and some of the best of Tom Baker's final season as the 4th incarnation of the Timelord. This set comes not only at a peak of the show's popularity, but during the restyling of the shows look (and sound). Producer John-Nathan Turner, retooled, the theme and graphic for the 80's, even the Doctor's threads, JNT introduced his appropriately somber plum gear. This set contains the finest examples of all of those changes, end for the Timelady Romana and K9, also the beginning of the end for the 4th Doctor.

""Full Circle"" is the first of this arc featuring not only an introduction E-Space, a smaller universe with a universe, but the Doctor's questionable next companion, Adric. Adric is a sortof smarter-version of the 2nd Doctor's Highlander companion Jamie, crossed with Dickens' ""Artful Dodger.""  Will Sci-fi writers never learn, the arrogant oversmart teenager is never appealing on screen, just as poor ole' Weasley Crusher. ""Full Circle"" for it's faults contains some great moments for Baker to chew-up the scenery, and some superb costuming, the Marshmen ala' creatures of the Black Lagoon. ""Full Circle"" is a tale of a culture apparently stuck in endless preparations for a ""return home"" with several dark secrets which further delay their journey. Determined to get ""back to the basics"" and have the Doctor solving problems without any quick fixes, the producers planned to remove K9 from the series. Already, opening the season with him exploding in saltwater, the assault on K9 continues having him spend much of this 4 parter with his head off.

The next story ""State of Decay"" is the best of the three...finally VAMPIRES in the Doctor Who Universe (or in this case an E-Space universe)...The Doctor tells in hoarse whispers how ""every known planet has legends of vampires"" and reads ancient tales of the early Timelords and the war with the Great Vampire and his minions, he reveals how after the bodies were tallied, he remained unaccounted for. Before Steven Moffat's episodes aired, State of Decay was surely the creepiest of the long running series. An ancient rocket, it's fuel tanks filled, not with fuel, but BLOOD!! Hoo, hoo! Genius! An the superb attention to atmosphere in ""the village,"" even Romana's wardrobe to the Hammeresques  trio of kingly vampires...Genius, I say again.

Finally, the escape from E-Space in ""Warrior's Gate."" Featuring a strange and interesting use of a virtual environment, while fairly common now was less successful in past attempts when the series worked ""set-less.""  Here I feel it works well achieving the ""nowhere"" effects (much like the 2nd Doctor's visit to the Land of Fiction), although much of this episode is overcomplicated and artsy. The cat-people make-up, of the Thrails and the neat Gundan robot warriors all add the high-concept effort of this unique story. In some early moments two of the crew of the Slaver ship indulge an homage to ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" even including the coin. The story follows a cat-like race that while once cruel masters themselves, are currently in need of liberating, the Doctor's prime hobby.  As always more great dialog, gems like the Doctor's, ""We'll burn that bridge when we come to it."" and from Romana, ""Astral Jung!""  The final farewell to Romana and K9 is brief and less moving than many departures in the show's history, although the Doctor assures us that she will be more than just alright...she'll be SUPERB.

The E-Space Trilogy is a really good set of DVDs to own at a pretty good price.

E-SPACE DRINKING GAMES...Drink whenever:

...the TARDIS Monitor shows an exterior shot of someplace they're not.

...you see a technacothaka or any other quirky turn of phrase like the ""Three Who Rule,""  ""the Wasting"" or even ""Mistfall.""

...K9 is broken, abused or otherwise written out of the story.

...the Doctor misquotes Shakesphere...like 'He who outlives this day and comes safe home shall stand a tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of E-Space!""

...the Doctor says, ""SWARMED"" ...what? ""Swarmed.""

...Adric seemingly or actually betrays Romana to gangs or vampires.

...a character melodramatically utters the title, example. ""...we've come Full Circle!""

...we see an establishing shot that is a model or a matte...like the STARLINER, The Tower, the Warriors Gate or the long shots of the SlaveShip.

...the Doctor shows off his (architectural) expertise and misses the mark like in the Tower of the Lords in ""State of Decay"" he says the decor is rococo when actually it's late Saxon/early Romanesque...oh snap!",1232582400,20,4876,5.062421972534332
1362858,4,B00004W5XP,"although not as epoch as ""Decay"" or ""Gate"" this beginning of the E-space triology is well told and thought out.  The big kids in the gang is a bit terran and the Doctor Who ""Jack and Jill"" syndrom of the late seventies(more on the early eighties) gets a bit old, as in Ardic and Nyssa or Seth and Teika or Valsh, Adric and his reluctant(Adric loathing) girl friend Kiera and contemptable gang of goofs. whatever David Fisher splats ink on it's my paper, my tape, my DVD plastic(if it ever is released) but thier all the same to me.  A childhood old country fairy tale from a little old lady from Linigrad(or whatnot). Aside from the compainion sub-plot of smaller scale than an inter-universal trip would warrent, the main story is somewhat intelligent and very compassionate(some would say libral but that is a dirogitive statement).  Their is much science here and one such science is the science of procrastination and ignorant irony of a forgetful crew of the Starliner and how it crashed(not shot on camera is a prologue of the REAL crew-true Taradonians- including an interesting captain).  James Bree(stern ""War Games"" Security Head with a voice that would cut your ears off it's so sharp!) takes most of the story to an interesting conclusion and becomes the acting decider after the original passed on via Adric's meddling.(not giving away the plot, subplot only! not much there in the way of interest anyway)-Decider Draith is also played by a great actor though, but two guest stars in the same room is not a good idea.(Tom and Lalla DVD comentary together???)",1181606400,,1571,4.807407407407408
1362859,4,B00004W5XP,"Three videos in one review? Well, let me give it a shot!
Full Circle: In Adric's debut story, the Doctor and Romana go through a CVE (Charged Vacuum Emboitment), en route to Gallifrey, and land on the planet Alzarius. The planet is experiencing Mistfall, a bubbling of the mists that bring out the Marshmen.
Adric is caught between sides. On one hand, he feels stifled by the conventions of society, but the Outlers, led by his brother Varsh, see him as part of the establishment. Naturally, there is only one place for him, as the viewer will see at the end.
The paralysis of the Alzarian ""Type D Oligarchy"" is painfully aware, as the Deciders have enforced a policy of deliberate ignorance on its citizens, and are guilty of ""willful procrastination."" As Login says: ""A little patience goes a long way."" The Doctor replies: ""Too much patience goes nowhere."" The strongest supporting character is George Baker who plays the decisive Decider Login, the most respected member of the community, who in the end gets something done. Second place goes to June Page as Keara, Login's Outler daughter, who would have been an ideal companion, but Nyssa came along in Keeper Of Traken.
This is a story with a mystery that is gradually revealed bit by bit, and it works effectively to that effect. Clues include Decider Nefred's pained reaction on seeing the system files, Draith's dying words: ""Tell Dexeter we've come full circle,"" and the pain shared by the Marsh child, being dissected by Dexeter, and Romana, who has an alien protein injected in her from a spider bite.
The Doctor's carelessness of leaving the Starliner door open leads to the Marsh child's entering the Starliner, subsequent capture, and death. Surprising for his character. And the rising of the Marshmen from the swamp is effectively realized. And those marsh spiders are creepy-looking!
State Of Decay: Still in Exo-space, The TARDIS lands on a planet, ""a typical medieval scene,"" dominated by a ""protective castle with village dwellings huddled like ducklings around their mother."" Reading, science, and knowledge are capital crimes, but that doesn't stop a secret rebel movement.
It turns out that the castle is actually an Earth ship that got [pulled] into E-Space a millennium ago. And who are the ""Three Who Rule, apart from being King Zargo, Queen Camilla, and Councillor Aukon? A cloud of bats, courtesy of effective stock footage, and fuel tanks filled with blood gives the Doctor ""a suspicion, but it's too horrible to think about.""
The Doctor has a good line when Romana asks him how he knew there was another planet in E-Space: ""Knowing's easy. Everyone does that ad nauseum. I just hope.""
 Debit: the Great One is only seen as a large claw groping the surface. And the Wasting is never explained. Still, a steady story in the trilogy.
Warrior's Gate: The TARDIS lands at Zero Point, the intersection between N- and E-Space, which is white nothingness (q.v. The Mind Robber). They run into a privateer named Rorvik, who has a ship carrying time-sensitive slaves, Tharils, ""leonine mesomorphs"" as described by Romana.
There is a wonderful surrealness of the Doctor walking through the black and white photos and drawings that is the link to the Tharil past. And the concept of a rapidly contracting dimension leading up to a mathematical disappearance is a novel concept. Episode 3's cliffhanger is effective, as the past quickly becomes the present, and the Doctor, surrounded by Tharils at the banquet table in one instant, suddenly finds himself surrounded by Rorvik and his crew.
There is snappy dialogue throughout. Lane: ""There's a hole that you can climb through. Matter of fact, I just did."" Or the Doctor: ""We'll burn that bridge when we come to it."" When Rorvik orders Romana hooked up, Packard, wondering of her abilities, says: ""If she isn't time sensitive, she'll burnt to a frazzle."" Lane: ""That's how you tell."" And Aldo and Royce are cariacatured union employees, lazy and apathetic, who don't care about bonuses being lost since they're on the ""all out contract."" And Biroc's defense to their enslavement of and later, by humans: ""The weak enslave themselves."" He also says that ""the universe is our garden.""
Errors are K-9's ears disappearing and reappearing in the first two episodes, and the Gundan Robot's axe falling on the Doctor's back without any injury to him.
This is the first of John Nathan-Turner's transitional trilogies. Adric is introduced, and the Second Romana and K9 Mark II are phased out. There would be a succeeding trilogy, also transitional, which would affect the Doctor personally.",1014508800,8,4600,4.989583333333333
1362860,5,B00004W5XP,"It was a great idea to release these three stories together, and it's a shame that the same wasn't done with the ""Turlough's Treachery Trilogy"" (Mawdryn Undead, Terminus & Enlightenment). ""E-Space"" introduces Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), whose presence makes a welcome change from the traditional inane female companion...though the actor isn't very good.
Great stories in general, and well paced. Of special note, for me at least, is the third story ""Warriors' Gate"", a spookily surreal escapade through non-ordinary reality that almost defies description. Another good thing about this one is that the series FINALLY loses K9...although we do find after a while that Adric isn't really all that much better. Romana's leaving scene is almost romantic in its surprise and haste, with the Doctor, aghast, ordering her to stay aboard and finally wishing her good luck with an enthusiastic, if wistful, thumbs up.",1006214400,5,909,5.363636363636363

7924918,5,B00004W5XP,"This is a boxed set of 3 discs in standard size cases, Mono sound, Audio Navigation, English subtitles, DVD 9 (dual layer).
PAL video format, Region 2.
As usual each disc includes worthwhile extras.

This is an amazing trilogy of stories by different authors, very much the best ever for any era of Doctor Who.
Each production is very inspired and unique.
Extremely well done.

Full Circle is a great adventure, one in which the Doctor is part of an articulate ensemble rather than the main focus.
Its concept was imagined by an insightful teenage writer, Andrew Smith which caused quite a stir at the time.
There is much interaction and dialogue here, not so many special effects. It reminds me of The Invasion Of Time but minus the long walking scenes.
This story was also the introduction for Adric, the teenage boy character whose relevance varied during his brief time.
He was, I believe, an effort to ensure the popularity of the series with younger people.
He seemed quite a hindrance or an annoying liability at times, especially in later stories beyond this trilogy but it is debatable.
The Marshmen humanoids look a bit like cabbage heads with wetsuits on and they sound a little like pigs. Odd.
I like the concept of an ancient race striving for something so long, the return to their home planet even though they had never been there.
Seems like an allegory for a number of things.

State Of Decay is an interesting Doctor Who twist on the traditional vampire concept, something of an homage to Bram Stoker's Dracula by the prolific Terrance Dicks.
I think it's innovative and enjoyable, with very Earth-like influences regarding vampire legends.
It does make sense to tie in with outer space vampires.
There are many frightening and suspenseful scenes, especially the legions of bats!
It's a bit subtle without blood and gore but the vampires die a pleasantly gruesome death.
The giant master vampire dies a little too easily I feel.
Should have been more of a challenge.

Warriors' Gate is obviously THE pinnacle of the fourth Doctor Who era!
It is an epiphany of inspiration and the quintessential definition for this era and Doctor Who himself.
It is as if the Time Lords intervened to guide the fourth Doctor to his destiny, his reason for being.
The weight of the narrative is so tremendous some of the characters are inconsequential, their attempt at comic relief is an annoyance. There is nothing they can say or do to make themselves relevant.
Their greed and persistence will never change The Truth, the reality of all things.
Immensely intelligent and challenging.
Brilliantly stimulating, this story will never age.
It is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction/fantasy, unparalleled by any other of this era.
It is evidence of the genius of Steve Gallagher, author and Paul Joyce, director.
This is so much more than something to watch, it truly is an experience, enlightening and comforting.
It flows like a stream of consciousness.
It is in a way a segue for a new era, a goodbye to familiar things especially Romana and K-9.
It is painful to watch them walk away from the Tardis and the Doctor. It is obvious things will never be the same.
It is for me, personally, The End of Doctor Who.
An immensely difficult goodbye.
Far from dying they find a new way of life, as would the fourth Doctor in the very near future.
I sort of wish he could have stayed with her and K-9 instead of mundanely falling to his death in the story Logopolis but the writers of course had other plans.
It would have been so sweet to see them all walking along a beach in E-Space.
I have much sympathy for poor K-9. He was battered and mistreated so much here while still trying to serve his purpose.
He was above all else loyal and useful.
A superb robot dog.
I simply can't give enough compliments for this production.
It is a bit limited by the outdated bluescreen technology of its time but story is what matters.
The time/continuum effects are exemplary, very convincing.
The visuals are so artistic and expressive they remind me of Jean Cocteau's film of Beauty and The Beast.
What a gift for the wonderful Mr. Tom Baker and all others involved.
What a gift for all enthusiasts.
Warriors' Gate is easily the # 1 production for any Tom Baker Doctor Who list.
It validates the entire series.
Historical.

A stunningly beautiful allegory for Time and Life itself.",1501632000,,4372,4.732283464566929
