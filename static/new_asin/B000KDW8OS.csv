8155721,4,B000KDW8OS,"In 1938 Argentina as WWII looms on the horizon, a family is torn apart by divided loyalties. A patriarch's (Lee J. Cobb) two daughters (Harriet MacGibbon, Kathryn Givney) have married a Frenchman (Charles Boyer) and a German (Paul Lukas) respectively. After the patriarch's death, the divided families move to Europe where they find themselves on opposite sides as Hitler marches through Europe. Dismissed when first released, the film's reputation is slowly turning around and getting recognized (especially in Europe) as a major work in the Vincente Minnelli canon. And some egregious casting decisions aside, it deserves the re-evaluation. It's really quite a good film, a sprawling epic examining how one family is destroyed by circumstances bigger than themselves. A 45 year old Glenn Ford is way too old to play the young playboy (the 51 year old Cobb plays Ford's grandfather!) in the role that made the young Rudolph Valentino a Star in 1921. But Minnelli's stylish direction, the compelling storyline more than compensate for the miscasting. There's a great score by Andre Previn, probably his best. With the Swedish actress Ingrid Thulin (her voice is dubbed by Angela Lansbury) looking every inch a Movie Star, Paul Henreid, Yvette Mimieux, Karl Boehm and George Dolenz.

8155723,2,B000KDW8OS,"This edition of MGM's THE 4 HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE was one of their ""Great Books on Video"" series. Stored in an oversized clamshell case, the gold-labeled tape is recorded in HiFi stereo from a clean source print. In its reduced from widescreen form, this pan and scan version often has two people conversing but we only see one of them.

Despite an enormous moment in history as backdrop, director Vincente Minnelli limits the scope to a handful of rooms. A few outdoor scenes of the City of Light that include actors may be them in front of hazy projections. An overloud, cloying music track meant to tug at one's heart has an opposite effect, it distracts the viewer.

We begin with an Argentine street festival that is backlot all the way. Cut to a family celebration which quickly turns tragic, then zip, boom! we and most of the family are in Paris (or a ROOM in Paree) shortly before it's invaded. Perhaps the original novel's size necessitated such episodic jumps.

Lee J. Cobb has too-little time as a cantankerous Argentine grandpa who drops dead after learning at the aforementioned party that one grandson is a Nzi. Glenn Ford can't muster enough charisma for the romantic lead. His love interest, Ingrid Thulin has flown-in dialogue voiced by Angela Lansbury. Yvette Mimieux's lines are re-recorded and sometimes out-of-synch.

Paul Henreid's role is difficult: a French Resistance leader arrested more than once who's eventually battered into the grave. Makeup and Henreid's performance are most convincing. Use of voiceover specialist Paul Frees would've been more effective if two of his familiar accents didn't overlap. First he's a Frenchman driving Ford to Normandy, then immediately after and in-between, Frees supplies the voice of a British officer.

No sympathy here for the adulterous lead characters, so their love story and 2.5 hours of footage are wasted on me. As a fan of so many of Minnelli's movies, my reasonable expectations for this epic were surprisngly and decidedly dashed. ""Horsemen"" is a misfire, the sort that gives classic movies a black eye. Thumbs down!

The philisophical differences brought about by WWII and nazism impacted wealthy and poor families alike and in the end, this family had to make moral judgements about itself, eventhough the family was destroyed in the end. Great drama, great personal message.",1165190400,,320,5.173076923076923
