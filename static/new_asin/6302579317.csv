Perfectly in tune brass, complete with Wagner Tuba quartet and the incomparable Bud Herseth and Dale Clevenger, sublime strings, ethereal woodwinds. It doesn't get any better than this. We may never hear something so spectacular again. Available only VHS",1355184000,,434,5.126760563380282
7827816,5,6302579317,"This is an excellent filming of a performance of his symphony no. 7 as conducted by Leonard Bernstein and performed by the Vienna Philharmonic (Wiener Philharmoniker). All 5 movements.  I own most of this series on VHS.  If you are a fan of Mahler and of Bernstein as I am, I think you will really enjoy this. I'm not sure if this has been put out on DVD, but the filming of the orchestra is very musical.",1199491200,,405,4.246753246753247
