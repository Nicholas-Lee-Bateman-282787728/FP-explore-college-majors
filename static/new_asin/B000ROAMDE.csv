 I have not seen the other featured movie",1397088000,,226,4.380952380952381
8201925,5,B000ROAMDE,"WHEN TIME EXPIRES is an underrated gem of a movie.  A tight, coherent intelligent script and competent understated acting by the entire cast.  Mark Hammil is surprisingly good with his character, even though it's a supporting role.  Just goes to show that an actor can only do as good a job as the script allows, and this script allows a lot of good subtle acting to happen.

A man arrives in a small modern western town to put a quarter into a parking meter (which has to happen two days later at precisely 8:01 AM) to change a series of events that will affect the history of Earth and save the planet from a nuclear holocaust.  Others are sent from the future to stop him in an attempt to cover up a huge snafu of future bureaucratic bungling that will end future careers for a series of inept but powerful bureaucrats.  Who will be successful when the moment of the critical time on the parking meter expires?

An unusual soft-spoken Sci-Fi effort where story and character are the forte rather than any heavy special effects showcase (although there are a few competently done EFX for a brief shootout).  (And this coming from someone who likes big EFX-heavy Sci-Fi films, also.)

It's obviously a (relatively) low budget film, but makes the most of it with an superb script, crisp acting, well-paced direction and editing, and a logical well set-up ending that shows that even a low budget film can be good if the studio butts out of interfering and allows a group of obviously talented people to simply make a good movie.

Too bad it's not available on DVD as a solo release.  Another dumb decision on the part of the film's distributors.  When will they learn?  (Probably never.)

Skip the other dumb thoughtless movie and buy this for WHEN TIME EXPIRES alone.  I did.  It's worth it.

8201926,4,B000ROAMDE,"After months of searching for a movie I remembered nothing else than it was SF and had something to do with a parking meter, I finally found the title, ""When Time Expires"", on IMDb. The search for the movie itself was equally awkward and as a last resort I found it at Amazon.com.
The movie was very satisfying and certainly deserves more than the IMDb-rating of 4.7. In my opinion this is a feel-good-movie.",1300406400,,408,4.527027027027027
8201927,3,B000ROAMDE,"The only reason I would purchase a movie that had no appeal to me, I had never heard of, or had not been reccomended to me by a friend is because of who was in it. Therefore my love for Joe Flanigan prompted me to make this purchase.

I was not dissappointed. He was on screen a great deal, he was great in the part (he made me a believer), and his part was pertinent to the plot. He was also as cute as ever. He was Joe Flanigan.

The story was well paced but the main character was an idiot. Not to give away the plot but some of the stupid things she did set her up for whatever came her way...and she called herself a lawyer?

Bottomline: I got what I wanted, a long look at Joe Flanigan and an interesting story. Now the companion movie in the package was only worth a fast-forward look see and a head scratching wonder as to why they put both of these films together. Maybe Joe could pull the other along, but that movie had already expired before it had seen the light of day.",1214352000,14,983,4.056701030927835
