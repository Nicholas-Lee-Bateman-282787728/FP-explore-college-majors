I've seen two pictures for this item. One has blue sky and the girls posing poolside - that's the (folded) poster. The other is a black and white underwater shot - that's the cover to the thick photobook. The actual item you get is a brown cardboard box, with the photobook, poster, DVD, and rubber coaster inside.

Here's what you get:

1) Photobook - 8.5"" x 10 and 5/8"" X 1 inch thick. A lot of nice photos, most taking up the entire page or more. An Amazon.co.jp reviewer says it's 290 pages, which seems about right.

2) DVD - 22:02 (that's zero hours, twenty two minutes, and two seconds). It starts with the girls at a scenic stop out in the desert. I think Tiffany says the name of the place in English, otherwise all the dialogue on the DVD is in Korean with no subtitles. The rest of the DVD has them going into the hotel, hanging out at the pool, doing photoshoots in the hotel room and at the end taking photos with spiderman and other characters completely out in public with crowds of people who apparently didn't know who they were. Really made me wish I was visiting Vegas at the time with CD's in hand to get autographed.

3) Folded poster approx 21"" x 25""

4) Rubber coaster designed like a casino chip with all the girls names on it

5) Brown cardboard box

I pre-ordered this from a Korean Ebay seller for $55 with shipping and I feel that was too much - there's no music. I would have muchpreferred a 3rd Japan Tour or fourth Japan album but they seem to be taking a break. They haven't even put out any Japanese singles this year (unlike the previous two years). Instead they are taking vacations in places like Vegas, which they deserve, so there.
