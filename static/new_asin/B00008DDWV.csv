1835621,5,B00008DDWV,"What took 'em so long?
Season 1 through 3.5 were the best of the Warrior Princess. You also grew with the characters especially Gabrielle. A definate must for Xena fans or even folks who didn't catch on til midway of the series. THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN!!...",1045612800,,260,4.4375
1835622,5,B00008DDWV,"It is about time this extremely popular show was produced on DVD.  I almost broke down and bought the VHS, but am very happy I waited for the DVD.  Season One arrived shortly before Christmas and my entire family (who weren't huge fans) know all the episodes by heart.  I am expecting Season Two any day along with the final episode.  The quality of the DVDs I purchased (on the xenahercules.com site) are excellent.  It also included an additional disk with bios, screensavers, etc and the computer game ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" or ""Death In Chains"".  Season One of Hercules, Legendary Journeys is now available as well.",1045440000,7,624,4.731481481481482
1835623,5,B00008DDWV,"It's been over seven years since Xena's debut episode aired, and a year and half after the series finale, we are finaly getting a DVD box set of Season One. These DVDs being released by Anchor Bay are suppose to have some special features that are not on the Davis-Panzer versions (which suck in picture quality). I hope that Anchor Bay really does try and upgrade the video and audio to look good on DVD. I was really starting to get depressed seeing shows like ""Felicity"" and ""Sports Night"" getting DVD releases, while we Xena fans were left begging forever, only to be ripped off by Davis-Panzer. PLEASE Anchor Bay, give us something nice.",1044576000,12,642,4.640350877192983
1835624,5,B00008DDWV,"FINALLY XENA HAS COME BACK TO D...VD. Its about time that the best action show of the ninties comes to dvd. i've been waiting for years to get this and now it is here. I only hope that Hercules gets released as well. If you like action, comedy, and scantily clad, leather wearing, sword weeling, chakram throwing action, this is definitely for you.",1044576000,,348,4.5396825396825395
1835625,5,B00008DDWV,"The 1st Season of Xena was addictive, mindblowing and, like all beginnings, had some kinks to be worked out. The casting of Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor was phenomenal from day one; Lawless (as most of you probably know) plays a profound, regretful, blue eyed, powerful former warlord who, thanks to help from Hercules, sets out to thoughtfully atone for her past reign of terror.

""Nothing you can do can erase the shame you've brought onto your kinsmen,"" Xena's mother exclaims. ""Probably not,"" Xena admits sadly, eyes dropping, ""but I'm going to spend the right of my life trying."" And does she ever! In one of her first attempts at being ""good"", the warrior princess lays eyes on Gabrielle, a spirited and selfless village girl who, after seeing Xena's heroics, wants to ""join up with Xena"" and ""wants to be a warrior like her"" As all fans know, Gabrielle is instrumental in reforming Xena by sharing her unconditional love & showing her how much good there is to be done. Xena, of course, has a renewed purpose & reason to live while gladly ready to die for Gab. Like most 1st seasons, the characters are a little shaky, the acting is new & unsual, & the plots are somewhat undefined & experimental & therefore not as soul pinching, action packed and heartpounding as the seasons that so bravely followed. Also, while X & G's relationship grew dramatically over the years, it was only ""friendly"" at this stage of the game. At least they wised up in the 2nd season.
Still, it holds a special place in the hearts of all Xena fans as the noble beginning of a timeless legend of pursuing the things that matter: love, sacrifice, the greater good, nobility, triumpth, loss, life.

There are 24 great episodes but HIGHLIGHTS include:
""Sins Of The Past"" -pilot episode
Xena journeys homeward determined to atone for the sins of her past, but her efforts to begin a new life are challenged by the vengeful warlord Draco. A betrothed village girl, Gabrielle, takes to the warrior princess immediately.

""Dreamworker""
Xena must enter the magical realm of the Dreamscape to rescue Gabrielle after she is kidnapped by an unlikely god.

""Altared States""
Xena & Gab intervene to save young boy from being sacrificed to a ""one God"" by his own father
""The Greater Good""
When Xena is hit with a poisoned dart, Gab must disguise herself as the warrior princess in a plan to save Salmoneous and a town from an evil warlord
""Callisto""
Xena  must battle the fierce woman warrior Callisto, who is bent on revenge for the burning death of her family by evil Xena years ago. One of my top ten faves of all times...
""Is There A Doctor In The House?""
Xena attempts to end the Mitoan-Thessalian War while trying to use her medical knowledge to save the lives of numerous casualties, including the critically wounded Gabrielle",1025222400,61,2806,4.730061349693251
1835775,5,B00008DDWV,I love this show and Hercules too. Two things would make amozazon prime better. 1 Make all the seasons avelable to stream of these two tv shows. 2the ado and the video do not line no matter what setting Iuse. This happens on every videoh,1488326400,,237,4.288888888888889

1835950,1,B00008DDWV,"We live in a kind of Orwell`s 1984 revisited. People are being anesthetized to accept the abnormal as normal; the impossible as possible. This series was shot in New Zealand but with American money; however is supposedly to have taken place in Ancient Greece. I said in ANCIENT GREECE, where blacks were SLAVES, when they were seen at all. But here, with the help of hypocritical America, they are princes, kings, and what have you. Even poor Xena is forced to have a black boyfriend. And to top it all, even HELEN of Troy is black. Tokenism has gotten out of hand.",1454716800,3,565,4.549019607843137

1835952,4,B00008DDWV,"Xena rules. Lets get that straight. Lucy Lawless is hot, and the show is awesome. Always was.  As for the DVDs themselves? While it is great to have them, Universal could have done a better job with the actual product. I suppose the fact that it is on DVD means technically the episodes are digitally remastered, but that's the extent. The quality is what have been on your TV back when they aired originally. So its average quality. Universal didn't do much with the picture if anything. Obviously Xena wasn't considered worth putting much money into. But it is Xena and they are available at least. Maybe someday Xena will get a better treatment, but enjoy these for now.",1449792000,,673,4.65546218487395

There are a lot of scenes where stories are told and memories are relived but for the most part the season is very good. They add in a couple of comedy scenes and I have to get used to combining action and drama with action and comedy which too me does not mix.

1836125,5,B00008DDWV,Used to watch this on TV and forgot about it until I saw it on Amazon at a great price. Ordered this and season 2 together and they are great. Highly entertaining in an almost sensual way but without any sexual exploitation. Highly entertaining for the whole family and also educational to the younger set as to what is right and wrong in the world and about taking responsibilities for others who are less fortunate when they are being mistreated and/or exploited and treating any one who deserves it with great respect. Good quality at a great price. Thanks Amazon!,1411084800,,567,4.68
1836126,4,B00008DDWV,"As someone who loves the show and was looking for a decent collection at a decent price, this was just what I needed. For under $15 dollars this is a solid set of season one. No, the quality isn't crystal clear, but that's really more of a deal with the filming than with the DVDs. The video quality seems to be as good as you're going to find. And while I'm not one to typically use subtitles, it's great that they're included here for those who do. The package itself is decent. It's one solid case with all the DVDs inside. While it's nothing flashy, the discs are easy to remove and the case does a fine job of protecting them. My biggest complaint would be that the case is solid black. The inside of the cover has a list of the episodes, but because of the solid black case it's completely unseen and therefor completely useless. Which is a shame because I would love to be able to just glance at it and see which disc I want when I open the case. I own seasons 2-5 as well and they all have clear cases that allow the episode list to be seen. So I'm not sure whether it was a change in packaging for the newer seasons or whether I just got the unlucky and got the crappy case. Either way it was/is annoying enough for me to knock a star off my rating.",1410566400,,1258,4.117886178861789

All the DVDs are slightly grainy with a few scenes that are downright granular. But it is all watchable and fun. Fast-play works (aka time compression) as does fast-FWD which I use on the episodes I consider dull or on some fight scenes. The aspect is 4:3 (aka 1.33:1).",1404432000,,397,4.1688311688311686

Her devoted friend, Gabriella (Renee O'Connor), rides by her side. She is a compassionate girl who hopes to be a warrior one day like Xena. In this set, Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) is a guest star.

1836183,3,B00008DDWV,"The previous incarnation of the Xena DVD series had loads of extras, interviews, behind the scenes and commentary.  The packaging was awesome. I had enjoyed the previous DVDs through a friend and finally wanted to get my own.

This release is NOT awesome.

It is a bare bones DVD that shows no signs of digital restoration and has zero extras.  As a huge Xena fan I was sorely disappointed in this release.  I know there have been some issues with the rights to the DVDs, according to what creator Robert Tapert said at a 2007 Xena convention. It seems that whomever has the rights now doesn't care about the series and has no understanding of the massive Xena fan base that has been hoping for years for someone to lovingly restore Xena and re-release a box set. This provides the same content that you can get from viewing Xena on Amazon Prime or Netflix.

I will not be purchasing any of the subsequent seasons of this release. I will be bidding on the original box set or buy it used here. It may cost more but it is worth it for the extras.",1374969600,,1045,4.38860103626943

1836243,5,B00008DDWV,"In a time when women on television and cinema were either portrayed as greedy divas (e.g: Dynasty, Dallas, Bold and Beautiful), or as romantic devices for action movie heroes, came a character that redefined viewers perception of women on television.

She was Xena, a character who appeared on Hercules's first season and eventually got such a good reception that her quest for redemption became a six season success.

Personally I think it was a good thing that the show was syndicated and was not the sole property of a main tv channel (ABC, FOX, NBC or CBS) because with the way that the show mixed both comedy and drama - or either veered in one of those directions for a few episodes - I don't think the mainstream channels would have known how to promote this show, which is what happened to Twin Peaks and Human Target who lasted no more than a few seasons unfortunately. Worse, they would have turned it into a more conventional tv show.

Back to Xena, the first season of this dvd is presented in Dolby 5.1, which is a great way to better experience the surroundings of Xena's adventures around Greece, though this sound quality has not been kept in the newer releases made by Universal, which has neither 5.1 sound system nor the special features of the first dvd release. As for the special features in the first DVD release, we have a series of screensavers and xena chronicles with which we can play a quiz asking questions about the adventures in Xena's first season. Personally, those special features are not bad. But it would have been nice to have had some of the promotional spots used for the release of Xena, commentaries from the creators, casting videos of the actors, bloopers on the show, and even the hercules episodes that introduced the Xena character. But anyway, this doesn't changed my satisfaction for this first season, which introduced to us the main characters of this show (xena, gabrielle, Ares, Callisto, Joxer, Autolycus, Salmoneus, the amazons) and their wonderful personalities, in an episodic structure that involved one adventure for each episode, along with some recurring one whose stories either continued or came to an inevitable conclusion.

As for the video quality, the show was apparently shot on 16 mm for the first few seasons and on this season, the image quality of the first eleven episodes are not at the top of the quality game. Though this improves after the first seventeen episodes and for the following seasons, the images have a bit of grain that may annoy some people. Of course the cgi effects on this season may look dated to the recent innovations on Spartacus, Lost and the last Xena seasons, but with the time constraints and their focus on their storytelling instead of their visual effects, Xena's story was a real treat for viewers all around the world and continues to exist even a decade after its final season.

The soundtrack by Joseph LoDuca was a pleasure to listen to and added the right emotions to the story and the characters' actions; while the stunts and the New Zealand landscapes used for the show made Xena's quest an epic event for viewers to experience.

Finally, of the episodes that I watched, my least favourite was the thirteenth episode since this episode was more of a best-of (something that I am not always fond of) that summarised the most important incidents of the first twelve episodes, along with excerpts from Kubrick's Spartacus (quite an irony considering Lucy Lawless's recent show on Spartacus). But my favourites were the following episodes: Episode 6 (Ares's first episode), episode 10 (the Amazons first episode), episode 15 (Xena pretending to be a princess who looks just like her), episode 17 (Bruce Campbell as Autolycus), episode 20 (for its great twists), episode 22 (Callisto's first episode), and episode 24 (where Xena and Gabrielle are in the stands healing people instead of fighting at the front of the war).

See you next season.",1328400000,5,3952,4.85459940652819

1836245,5,B00008DDWV,"There are few shows that combine fast action, superior writing, as well as acting!

That this collection; is getting harder to come by....You just cannot pass this series up!",1317772800,,525,4.898876404494382
1836246,5,B00008DDWV,"This review is about the show. Not about the dvd itself. I do wish Amazon could have a two rating system. One that represents tv shows/movies opinion, and one that represents dvd quality issues. I see some low ratings which is a shame, since many of these are based on the dvd quality and not the show itself.

The Review:

I agree with some commenters that in season one of Xena, it doesn't know what it is yet. In season two it has a firm foothold on to what this show is and will become.  What we all know now, an iconic cult classic!

I do like season one very much however.  I love the rawness of it. In some ways, it not knowing what it is yet is endearing to me, especially knowing what's to come down the road. I get a sense that the budget isn't very large, and yet the show still manages to pull off a fabulous first season.

Xena incorporated many different things. It has drama, action, comedy, mythology, sexiness, and love. It's filled with fx that were at the time amazing, and are still decent to this day despite my perception being influenced by 300, Shrek, LOTR, and others. The clever tongue-in-cheek and wink, wink moments will leave you stitches. I love the way the writers put their own spin on mythological events! And yes there is some silliness, but it's the good fun-time kind! For those of you out there who have never seen Xena, you may be very surprised at the amount of depth this show actually had. There were times it could bring you to tears. I loved escaping into this show for an hour every week when it aired. So much the better now with dvds.

Lucy Lawless encompasses the role of Xena, an amazing empowered female warrior, and makes it truly her own. Her delivery of lines and facial expressions are simply outstanding. Renee O'Connor is cute and funny as Xena's sidekick Gabrielle. These two ladies begin a friendship in season one that is sweet and will become a very powerful entity on this show as the series continues. The action is awesome. The beautiful New Zealand scenery will take your breath away, as will the amazing music on the show. And lest I forget, there are some very good stories in season one.

I like all the episodes. But some key episodes, IMHO are:

Sins Of The Past - Not only did it introduce us to Xena and Gabrielle, but to  Xena's mother, Cyrene and the villain Draco, both of whom will recur for a few episodes throughout the series. It also gives us some insight into Xena's past. Very emotional as Xena reunites with her mother. Xena and Gabrielle become friends and hit the road together!

The Reckoning - The introduction of Ares played by the late great charismatic Kevin Smith. An important character that will appear in 31  episodes. He temps Xena back toward her dark side. A startling confrontation between Xena and Gabrielle takes place, and Gabrielle gets her first glimpse at a much darker Xena.

Hooves and Harlots - Well writtened. Filled with lots of action, humor and scantily clad Amazons that kick ass. The introduction of the Amazons and Centaurs is important as they become significant in the lives of Xena and Gabrielle throughout the series. Gabrielle is given her trademark staff and learns how to fight in this episode.

Callisto - That one name seems to say it all, doesn't it? Xena's arch enemy will cause so much drama in the lives of both Xena and Gabrielle throughout the series. Played brilliantly by Hudson Leick. This villain is one badass bitch worthy of being Xena's opponent! Also of note, the introduction of Joxer played superbly by Ted Raimi.

Honorable mentions to: 'Prometheus' - a crossover with Hercules characters, Hercules and Iolaus that was just plain fun to me. 'Dreamworker' - which has some great dialogue and we get to see Gabrielle outwit her opponents. 'A Royale Couple of Thieves' - I'll just say Bruce Campbell. That in itself says it all!

All-in-all a very satisfying first season which sets the stage for so many amazing things to happen as the series progresses.",1309824000,3,3990,4.598591549295775
1836247,5,B00008DDWV,I like this season one of Xena very much.  I like all the stories in this set.  And I like the way Xena and Gabrielle got to start their close friendship.  It's a very good season.,1307318400,,180,3.9444444444444446

Although there are no extras, you don't even notice the lack with a season as good as this one. Each episode is worth watching! Since I already read several reviews beforehand I was prepared for what the product what have and it didn't disappoint.

Top Marks!!!",1301961600,,352,4.67741935483871
1836249,2,B00008DDWV,"I didn't watch this show when it was originally on TV, so my comments are based upon some five episodes I've viewed from the DVD.  The question that came to mind as I watched was:  who were the regular viewers of Xena and what brought them back week after week?  It seemed to me that Xena was directed toward two groups:

(1)  Young women and girls who saw Xena as an ideal, because she fought and defeated men (usually several men at once) physically.  In this she was similar to Wonder Woman, although the latter was almost always subservient to a man, whereas Xena is strictly on her own, using incredible flips and flying dropkicks.

(2)  Men with lascivious thoughts elicited by Xena's rather spectacular physique, those bare thighs, that skimpy brass and leather costume Lucy Lawless wore.  It certainly was not her acting range.

All in all, Xena is not a particularly entertaining show, if one is not a drooler--I'm past that stage in life.  The plots are overly simple.  The acting requires little from the actors, except practice with a broadsword.  The mythology is a confusing mishmash.  The settings are OK.  And I doubt that I will be watching further episodes.  Why see more of the same?",1301356800,3,1202,4.679425837320574

Just today i got this in the mail. I really cant complain about the fact that are no special features because the first dvd did have quite alot and I never really saw them. This set is much smaller than before and is the size of a normal dvd case. Ive read reviews where people complain about resolution on this dvd but people must understand that this season was filmed on 16mm which means it will be grainy, with that said however, it is much less grainy and better in picture then from the other dvd. Also, this DVD has SUBTITLES!!!!!!! Something never seen before on a xena dvd. So, is this a great DVD? Yes. But, if you already own the other dvd, i see know point in buying this. Unless your like me, a die hard fan, you need to have both. So i have the orginal dvds (1-6) and now i have the new dvd(1) and when season 2 comes out in March(?) ill buy that as well. So all in all, if you don't have season 1, or if u do and just want this like me, buy it. Also, if u never heard of xena in your life and somehow stumbled upon this, BUY IT! i garrentee you will love this show!",1294704000,5,9071,4.774029280712922

Set in ancient Greece but filmed in beautiful New Zealand, it is both a visual and an intellectual feast. In addition to an award-winning musical score, it features actor Lucy Lawless, who plays Xena to perfection. The character of Xena is a fine role model for women who wish to get in touch with their inner strength without losing their femininity. Cleverly written, humorous at times, always creative, Xena: Warrior Princess is one of those shows which produces loyal fans whose dedication endures years after the show ceases production.",1293321600,3,629,5.176470588235294

This is an OUTSTANDING show and the DVD's have worked perfectly. I'm buying the entire series. The setting of the show in ancient Greece is very interesting.

Still the show what is the important thing looks good, not great just good.

1836285,5,B00008DDWV,"This is a review based on what I can see when I did a side by side video comparison. As for the show 5/5 :D
Thought I might just share this so that users may know about the differences.

The two DVD compared are the new release DVD by Universal Pictures and the out of print Anchor Bay release. These two DVDs were tested using a full HD TV (like it's really going to matter anyway).

Video Quality:

Well, to be honest, I can't really see any major difference. Okay, there's a bit of differences. The universal release is much brighter than the anchor bay release; they also added some blur effects. For some scenes, the blurriness and brightness seems to make it lot better and it looks appropriate; however, most of the time, the anchor bay release seemed much more defined and real. As for the graininess, it's pretty much the same.

DVD Menu:

When it comes to DVD menus, the anchor bay release is a lot better. The universal release showed only the logo and went straight to the menu. Conversely, the anchor bay release had this intro before revealing the menu. The menu of the universal release was just a still picture of Xena, similar to the one on the cover. The anchor bay one has motion pictures in the background and cool effects. One of the best things about the universal menu is the ability to play all, aside from that, nothing really fancy at all.

Special Feature:

The winner for this category can be debated. For me, the universal release wins. Yes, the universal pictures has no behind the scenes or any video or audio commentary, neither did the anchor bay. The anchor provided pictures and a CD that had character bios and a screensaver. But the best thing about the universal pictures release is subtitles. Yep, that's right, Xena finally has subtitles!

Packaging:

Anchor Bay wins this category. I really love the cool book style the anchor bay release has. The universal pictures is just a standard DVD case; although, the pictures on it are good. The disks of the anchor bay release has pictures on it, but the universal release only had a few printings and showed more metal. This category can also be debated. Some people, like me, likes the whole fancy aesthetic book style kind of thing and some people like simplicity and portability.

I can't really compare the audio, because as one plays, I completely forget about the other. I think that's everything. Have fun shopping.",1287100800,16,2408,4.631455399061033

1836289,4,B00008DDWV,"Do you want the good news or bad news first?
Okay,the good news:If you have already bought the Xena catalogue from Anchor Bay studios you will be pleased to know you have the most definitive Xena you can have. The bad news?:There are NO,I repeat NO,extra features whatsoever in this entire set! Not even a measly commentary. This is Xena lite to be sure. And the quality of the shows ""look"" will be addressed a little farther on in the technical section of this review(don't miss that!).
Created from the fertile minds of Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert this series was a spin off from the already running and successful Hercules series. Xena started in the /95-/96 TV season while Hercules was already running as of January/95 and the character Xena was intro'd through three Hercules eps,Warrior Princess,The Gauntlet and Unchained Heart. Personally I was already a Hercules fan and watched both concurrently until I lost interest in Hercules story arc when Iolaus was killed off,his ""likeness"" brought back then killed off,and finally Iolaus himself brought back for good,in a series of totally unbelievable scenarios. This is when Xena took over for me and I stayed with this ground breaking series from then on. Why/how groundbreaking you ask? Firstly,like Hercules,the producers brought to the table an uncommon and unique mix of martial arts/action/drama/comedy that had never been seen before on television or since. Secondly they used the backdrop of ancient Greece to play in and I will have you note the unprecedented amount of movies that have since been made from 2001 onwards when Xena finally left the airwaves. Think 300,Troy,Rome,the more recent remake of Clash of the Titans,Alexander,etc,etc. I believe Raimi and Tapert created a virtual two man modern renaissance of this genre through Hercules and especially Xena;to which no one has given them proper credit.
Everything about Xena from beginning to end was great from the acting,to the ep plots and something just as important which gets overlooked too much,the stunt work. I defy anyone in the business to find a more capable group of stunt men and women than those in New Zealand.
The first season of Xena introduces us to most of the characters that would become familiar to its fans throughout its six year run. We see Draco played most viciously and directly by Jay D'Gaia,Meleager the Mighty played wonderfully by Tim Tomerson,the psycho-killer of Callisto played to the hilt by beautiful Hudson Leick,the always confident/self assured God of War played beautifully by the late Kevin Smith,Autolycus,the King of Thieves(lifted literally hook,line and sinker from Shakespeare's ""The Winter Tale"")played with great aplomb by Bruce Campbell(long associate of Tapert and Raimi),Salmoneus the ""king"" of salesmen played slickly by Robert Trebor,and my personal favourite Joxer,played with a great sense of whimsy and comedy by Sam Raimi's brother Ted;definitely Ted's best and longest lasting role.
I have never seen a TV show that could be so action packed,even violent,one minute then have you in tears the next. The bond that develops between a repentive(for her past mistakes)Xena(Lucy Lawless)and her naive but slowly maturing bard companion Gabrielle(Rene O'Connor) is indeed special to behold. The lesbian community would of course later run with this concept but this season more often than not runs counter to their claims and is often overlooked proof contrary to their arguments,as we are several times introduced to both Xena and Gabrielle's male lovers both present and past. It's unfortunate also that Lawless would fuel the lesbian angle herself,I think just to gain more viewers than anything else. After all ratings are what counts in the TV biz.
Alright let's look at the ""look"" of the eps in this set. I do not have the Anchor bay set of Xena's to compare to but I do have the first season of Hercules. Hercules looks great on the Anchor Bay set but Xena through most of the first season here looks like it was shot on 16mm film rather than 35mm(that is only a guess as I do not know the specific filming particulars).Although generally good in contrast,sound and colour they can be quite grainy;going from good to poor in a matter of a few scenes. Moreover there are film clips from the trio of Hercules/Xena eps,clips from the 50s film Spartacus starring Kirk Douglas and even a clip from a Steve Reeves Hercules movie inserted into several eps and ALL to a one are beautifully crisp and clear! This tells me it isn't the transfer that is the problem here it is the actual film stock used. However things DO improve. Almost 3/4 the way through the season beginning with the ep ""Altared States"" the film stock improves greatly and begins to look like the 35mm it should. From here on some eps look mostly like 35mm while some even look like a combination of 35mm and 16mm. If this is the case I can only speculate that Raimi and Tapert had a severely limited budget from Universal to work with(with two shows running concurrently)and as a result had to resort to the cheaper film stock to create the spin off(Xena)until the ratings were able to justify the faith they had in it.
This five single disc set of Xena is packed tightly in a standard size DVD case and each disc comes embossed on top with a chakram. Nice to look at,if nothing else.
All in all I think I will recommend this set. I almost thought of rating this set much lower both for the appalling lack of extras(none) and the graininess of the film present in most of the eps. However the film issue is explainable and the lack of extras DO make this set more affordable to those of us(like me)who couldn't afford the original set through Anchor Bay. There are no pretensions here from Universal as what you see in these 24 first seasons eps are definitely what one gets;a bare bones issue. However you can bet I(along with many others I'm sure)will be scrutinizing season two VERY closely and hope the film stock will be a non issue from then on.",1274659200,3,5998,4.875612144955926

-- Lucy Lawless answering ""Who is Xena?""

I give my highest recommendation for this entire remarkable television series.

By season three, this show would create what I think is the best episodic television ever produced.  The first season contains numerous rough edges and incomplete thoughts, but it is still astonishing work.  During season one, the actors, producers and writers were finding their way and the audience can see the learning process they went through on their way to making history.

There are few new features in this version of season 1 over the original Season 1 box set.  All 24 uncut episodes of the first season are included in the 17 hours and 39 minutes of content.

The set is on five DVDs packed into a single DVD sized PVC case.  Full screen 4:3 aspect video (as edited), shot on 16mm film, so the look is somewhat short of today's high definition standards.

Audio track is English only and there are no commentaries, featurettes or interviews.  There are English subtitles (finally), but no other languages.  The menu allows entire disk or individual episodes to be viewed.  There are chapter breaks (not included on the menus) aligned with the Act breaks for the teaser, and Acts 1,3, and 4; but strangely not for Act 2.

I rewatched the entire season when I got this set.  Something I haven't done in almost ten years.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the series has held up.  Many of the Xena storylines have become near clichs in the intervening decade as Buffy, Dark Angel, Alias and similar series have mined the same plots and themes.  But Xena and Gabrielle still resonate and still have the power to make me feel the pain and triumph of their existence.

1836322,5,B00008DDWV,"I give 5 stars for the tv shows themselves.  Xena is one of the greatest tv shows of all time.

I have compared the new DVD set to the original release and see absolutely no change in the picture quality.  It still looks grainy and full of artifacts.  I was hoping that the new release would be remastered better but it isn't.  If you have the original release of the DVD, I see no reason to buy this new set.  If you do not own it, what are you waiting for?  Xena rules!",1272153600,16,471,4.0
1836323,5,B00008DDWV,"The reason people are complaining about the surround sound (2.1 or whatever I wouldn't know the difference), the grainy video quality picture, lack of extra features; etc is because (and this is the plain & simple truth) THIS DVD RELEASE was especially targeted towards us deaf & hard of hearing fans of the show. It is evident when you see the ONE THING UNIQUE to these discs that wasn't present in the (out-of-print no longer produced by the manufacturer)Anchor Bay release of Xena Warrior Princess Season 1. And what was the UNIQUE THING? What is it about these new DVDs of Xena Warrior Princess season 1 that STANDS OUT from the other previous release?? The English Subtitles!!!!! I'm in the Elysian Fields!!!! Finally, I can throw away all the stupid (really thick) hardcopy scripts I printed out on Whoosh! Online. No longer do I need to read the papers while watching the show (simultaneously) to understand what the characters are saying. Whew!!! This DVD RELEASE is what I have been waiting for since 2007!!!!!!! I really, really hope.... And I mean HOPE (sorry Gabrielle, bad choice of words; I hope I didn't offend ooops there it goes again; I mean I didn't mean to remind you of your evil daughter) that there might be another all-new release of the SECOND SEASON of Xena Warrior Princess (with English Subtitles of course!!!) Because the previous Anchor Bay release didn't include the closed-captioined either.

Ok, ok, ok, Gabrielle, to make up for my critical mistake, I'll now sing the song ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" (your favorite!) or recite the one you sung in ""Fins, Femmes & Gems"" (Lovely Lass), make sure the phrase ""irritating little blond"" gets eliminated from the Xenaverse dictionary (or transfer it to Callisto instead regardless of the fact she has already been purified by the waters of heaven in ""Fallen Angel""), write another poem for you (even better than the one Xena gave you in ""Many Happy Returns!""), polish your precious sais weapons now (so you'll be ready for your new journey to Egypt in search for the girl who needs a chakram), and kick Xena in the butt for not reading your beautiful scrolls back in ""The Ides Of March!!"" Most importantly of all, I'll try to follow in your footsteps: study the stars, speak to philosophers, and try to acquire the gift of prophecy (I'll especially need to be able to predict in the future whether or not Universal Studios will RELEASE ALL of the discs from ALL SEASONS in the next few years).

P.S. Gabby, and I promise I won't tell anyone you have six toes!!! Don't worry, we all have some sort of ""birth defect"" in us. Nobody's perfect! **Smile**

Note To Universal Studios: Please, please, please, be sure to include Xena's oh so very soft (too soft) whisper of ""oh sweetheart"" (english subtitles) when they finally had their very emotional teary (sniff, sniff) reunion back in ""A Family Affair"" if you can.....)

P.S.S. And yes, I totally agree with Brunhilda (the beautiful valkyrie), Xena & Gabby are soulmates who are together for all eternity; forever in any realm & reincarnation!!!",1271980800,6,3066,4.82319391634981
1836324,4,B00008DDWV,"I looked for some reviews before picking up Universal's re-release of Xena: Warrior Princess - Season One, and unfortunately couldn't find any, so I purchased the set even though I didn't know what to expect.

-- Packaging / Discs --

Xena: Warrior Princess - Season One is packaged in one of those standard sized cases capable of holding multiple discs. The previous release by Anchor Bay (AB) was one of those brick sized digi-packs where you had to unfold the entire thing to get to all the discs. The reverse side of the cover lists all the episdoes (by disc) and includes breif summaries. There is not mention of first air date for the episodes. The discs themselves are all single sided, double layered discs. The only artwork on the discs is the red outline of the chakram (the round throwing blade used by Xena) and the ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" logo.

-- Video Quality --

First of all, I'm watching the episodes on a 32"" Vizio 720p HDTV. It's being played on a progressive scan DVD player at 480p.

I no longer have access to the AB release of Xena: Warrior Princess - Season One, and thus can't compare the video quality of that set to this new one. Based on my memory of last watching the AB release (which was quite a few years ago) I can say that the episodes on the Universal release don't look any worse. In some cases that look better.

The picture has grain, that's going to be unavoidable considering Xena: Warrior Princess - Season One was shot on 16mm film stock. It wasn't until halfway through the second season that the producers switched to 35mm film stock. I haven't noticed any of the compression artifacts or other problems that plauged the AB release of this season. It's unfortunate that Universal couldn't have made this a 6 disc release, because I imagine that without the additional compression needed to fit 5 episodes per disc the video quality could be a little better. Regardless of that oversight, I'm more than pleased with the video quality of this release.

-- Soundtrack --

Xena: Warrior Princess - Season One is presented in a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. That's just a fancy way of saying it's the orginal broadcast audio. Some people have complained because Universal choose to include the orginal audio rather than the upmixed 5.1 soundtrack that was created for the AB release. Most home theater systems are capable of upmixing 2.0 audio into 5.1 audio anyways.

-- Subtitles / Captioning --

Universal has included english subtitles for all 24 episodes. This was a feature that wasn't included on the AB release.

-- Extras --

Other than a handfull of trailers on the first disc, there are no special features included on this set. The AB release was also light on extras (it included a CD-ROM with some extra content for your computer). Universal owns the rights to the Xena: Warrior Princess tv series, but all of the special features included on the AB releases were produced and are owned by Davis/Panzer and the only way Universal can included these featues on their DVD's is if they license the right to them. Considering that this re-release of Xena: Season One is pretty much a budget release, I don't see Universal spending that kind of cash.

-- Conclusion --

Until a proper comparrison of the video quality of the AB release to the Universal release is done, I don't think it's fair for me to reccommend that people who have purchased the AB set, go out and replace it with this release. I will say that if you don't have the AB sets, or are one of the many hearing impaired Xena fans who held off on purchasing the previous sets because of the lack of subtitles/captioning then you really can't go wrong with this release.",1271721600,70,3685,4.657935285053929

1836335,4,B00008DDWV,"Having never been much of fan of the Hercules series I was a hit and miss viewer of Xena: Warrior Princess when it first aired. Like Hercules, Xena featured many campy elements and over-the-top fighting, but along the way this series began to distinguish itself from its more campy older brother.  Sure, Xena had its campy elements from the first episode all the way to the last, but there were also moments a great drama and the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle was far stronger, more intimate, which was also set it apart.  Not just because it featured two women instead of two men, but because the gender could allow a more interesting relationship to form.

Part of what made Xena: Warrior Princess so good was the great recurring cast the cropped up nearly every season.  Season one introduced us to Ares, played by the late Kevin Smith; Joxer ""the Mighty,"" played by the always funny Ted Raimi; and probably one of the best recurring characters of the series, Callisto.  The episode, ""Callisto,"" ranks as one of my favorites from season 1.  Played in all her crazy villainous best by Hudson Leick, Callisto is probably one of the more interesting villains Xena crosses paths with.  In part because she blames Xena for what she's become but also because she's a constant reminder of Xena's bloody past.

The first few episodes are not that great.  The campy nature of the action is a bit much and I think the writers were struggling with how they wanted to present the character of Gabrielle.  For me, the episode ""The Royal Couple of Thieves,"" a fun episode featuring the always great Bruce Campbell, was a turning point for the series that led to even better episodes like ""Prodigal,"" where the writers finally figured out what to do with Gabrielle; and ""Callisto,"" easily one of the best episodes of season one.

1836338,4,B00008DDWV,"Back in the early '90's I was a big fan of the 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' series. When I learned a spin-off series titled 'Xena: Warrior Princess' was to be released in '94 I was certain it was going to be a big failure. Looking back via hindsight I can only guess that my reasoning for such a prediction was probably something like the extreme possibility of over saturating the audience with too much of a good thing. Now all I can say is boy was I wrong!  They knew exactly what they were doing, taking everything that worked from Hercules, including cast and characters, and added a very heavy dose of darkness that was a perfect counter-balance to the lovable good guy, harm no one if possible attitude portrayed by Kevin Sorbo (i.e.: Hercules).

If there was ever a person born for the express purpose of playing a particular role it has to be Lucy Lawless in the starring role of Xena. Her physical appearance, beautiful and expressive face, high energy and uncanny ability to be believable as a heroine one moment and the most evil  villianess the next is truly remarkable. The addition of Renee O'Connor as side-kick Gabrielle was also a gem of a find. Cute, adorable and chatty, she's the perfect compliment to the more sullen and introspective Warrior Princess.

This is a wonderful beginning to six amazing and unforgettable seasons of television viewing. There have been many memorable television shows through the years, but none that have even come close to creating and sustaining a world so mythic, believable and entertaining. That's the legacy of 'Xena: Warrior Princess'.

Postscript: I know what you're thinking. After such praise why only -4 Stars-? Why, because it got even better in forthcoming seasons! I had to leave some margin to allow for improvement didn't I?",1227052800,,1797,4.840390879478828
1836339,4,B00008DDWV,"I watched Xena every week usually with my mother. This first season set was a gift from my daughters for Mother's Day and it was just what I wanted. I had forgotten that Callisto appeared so early in the series. I am happy to have this set to share with my kids and my youngest daughter wants to be a cross between Wonder Woman and Xena when she grows up!

I really enjoy the character development in the early episodes and Ares is sooo much better looking here than he was in the first season of Hercules. The ultimate 'Bad Boy' tempting Xena.

The only thing I would have appreciated is captioning as I have a minor hearing impairment and some words are difficult for me to catch.",1204934400,2,682,4.3203125
1836360,5,B00008DDWV,"This series had everything in it: Comedy, drama, inspiration, musicals, etc... I also believe this was a series that helped create certain television shows and movies. Watch (Here She Comes... Miss Amphipolis 1997) and tell me that's not similar to (Miss. Congeniality 2000). Remember that Xena was being played in a different time period (Historical Times) and Miss. Congeniality is being played in the present, yet they are still similar. The show not only had a few good laughs with the help of Joxer (Ted Rami)but also allows viewer the feeling of Catharsis. Seeing Xena battle her past demons and realizing she wouldn't be the hero she is without her past is PRICELESS. Also watching the growth of  Xena (Lucy Lawless) and Gabrielle's (Renee O Conner) friendship is something very special. They become family and travel to the exotic lands of Asia and to the beautiful landscape of Egypt etc...

The DVDS are worth it I own all 6 seasons and the commentaries are GREAT. I especially love watching Hudson Leick's (Callisto)commentary she's intelligent, funny, and beautiful.

P.S. My one note would be buy the director's cut of The Final Episode (A Friend In Need) because it's much better. Plus you get great extras including commentary by Lucy, Renee, and Rob and you also get behind the scene footage including a little B-Day cake for Lucy. The commentary is great I just finished watching it again for my 100th time because I find Lucy and Renee hysterical.

I will always have faith that a Xena Movie will be made, although Gabrielle lost faith in her Hope; I will always have faith that Xena will eventually become a movie; plus I'm only 19 so I still have plenty of years left to wait lol.

Well Thank you Lucy, Renee, Rob, Hudson, Ted, Bruce, Kevin and all the other people that made Xena possible. You filled many homes with joy, laughter, and inspiration; it truly is one of televisions greatest moments!",1200787200,2,1918,4.817629179331307
1836361,5,B00008DDWV,My husband was a huge Xena fan when it was on tv and he was very pleased with this gift.  He can't wait to get the rest of the seasons as well.,1193443200,,143,3.46875
1836362,2,B00008DDWV,"XENA is the very definition of a cult show.  Its main claim to fame is that it was the first television series to feature as its lead a truly heroic female.  It would very shortly be superceded by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, not just because it also because it featured a strong female lead, but because on every level it surpassed XENA in quality of writing, acting, and narrative.  Unlike XENA, which was reviled by TV critics from the moment it debuted to the second it ended, BUFFY was lavished with love by critics from its beginning until its end.  And even today BUFFY is used by a host of mainstream critics as a benchmark for quality television.  And unlike XENA, which has not expanded its North American fan base since the end of the series, BUFFY has more fans today than when it ended.

Nonetheless, the historical importance of XENA cannot be exaggerated.  With the exception of Dana Scully on THE X-FILES (who appeared two years before XENA), Xena and her companion Gabrielle were the first truly heroic women on television possibility since Mrs. Emma Peel on THE AVENGERS in the sixties.  True, there were other superficially heroic women, but most were undercut by other factors.  On WONDER WOMAN, the hero was undercut by her constant deference to Maj. Trevor and her determination to make him look good.  Angie Dickinson's Pepper Anderson on POLICE WOMAN was hurt by her persistent dressing up as a hooker or stripper on multiple episodes.  In 1991 Susan Faludi correctly wrote in her landmark book BACKLASH that television was populated almost exclusively by regressive female characters and cited network resistance to CAGNEY AND LACY and a preference by the studios by ""nesting"" female characters who were constantly regretting taking on careers instead of staying at home with the children on shows like thirtysomething.  Dana Scully was an astonishing repudiation of this tradition.  And Xena took this to a completely different level.  Xena was the first heroic female figure in the grand tradition.  She was the first female hero who could outfight heroic men, overwhelm opposing armies in one-on-many action, and who more or less make sex and gender irrelevant.

Nonetheless, XENA's influence on subsequent has been far more difficult to gauge than one might expect.  The main reason for this has been the appearance of BUFFY in XENA's second season.  It is pretty clear that XENA exerted no influence on BUFFY.  Though on TV XENA appeared in 1995 and BUFFY in 1997, Buffy had already appeared in movie form in 1992.  And there is no question that virtually every female hero after Buffy was influenced far more by the Sunnydale vampire slayer rather than Xena.  Most of the reason for this lies in the fact that XENA is made in the in the style of Hong Kong martial arts films.  BUFFY utilized some wirework, but XENA was dominated by it.  Also, all fights on BUFFY were presented from a point of view where you could see every facet of it, many of the key moments in a XENA fight were shot in extreme close up so that you couldn't really see the stunts that were supposed to be taking place.  In short, even though BUFFY was about a vampire slayer, everything else was done in a fairly realistic style, whereas there was virtually nothing realistic about XENA.  This was underscored by a huge range of aspects of the show that flew in the face of realism.  Much of this concerns the incredible disjunct between everything that is known about ancient history and XENA's use of history.  There are dozens of historical ""howlers"" that will horrify any student of ancient history.  Among several score examples I will cite only one, where Gabrielle attends a bard's competition in Athens.  She befriends another bard who turns out later to be Homer.  For his part of the competition he tells the story of Spartacus, who led a slave revolt against the Roman Empire.  Euripides also appears in this episode.  Let's see.  Current scholarship does not believe that there was an historical Homer, but that it is a collection of orally transmitted poems from the 9th and 8th centuries BC.  Euripides lived in the 5th century BC.  And Spartacus was a slave in the Balkans in the 2nd century BC.  Fans of the show frequently feel that the use of history on the show is unimportant, but for people with a respect for history the footloose way of dealing with history can be as alienating as Xena's twenty-foot in the air forward somersaults or her rather more absurd throws of her chakram.

Still, as XENA went on the abuse of history decreased (for an extended period of time following the introduction of Caesar in Season two they kept almost all the historical characters to a specific period of the Roman Empire), the overall writing improved dramatically, the two lead characters became more complex and fully developed, and the story as a whole became more complex.  I believe Season One is an almost unmitigated failure, but the show definitely improved.

Much of the future improvement was hinted at even in Season One.  In the first few episodes both Xena and Gabrielle are very poorly sketched characters.  Xena is merely a kicker of the tails of her enemies, Gabrielle her naive but enthusiastic follower.  But by the end of the season, especially in the excellent two-parter ""The Greater Good"" and ""Callisto,"" the show presented viewers with two very excellent episodes.  Though Hudson Leick was a very marginal actress, her Callisto nonetheless seemed to bring the best out in Lucy Lawless.  I want to emphasize that while I think most of the episodes of Season One to be inferior, it is not because of either Lucy Lawless or Renee O'Connor.  Instead, it was the fault of the writers in giving them inferior material to work with.  They were given almost no good material in Season One, but Season Two would see more and more excellent episode (though the season as a whole is also a failure).  But by Season Three the show would have seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of the writing.

By the end of Season One both Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor have, even with the inferior scripts, as likable characters that viewers come to care about.  The two become perhaps the most successful female ""buddies"" in the history of TV.  Much has been made about latent lesbian themes on the show, and no doubt in later seasons the writers did much to encourage this, but this is clearly secondary to the great friendship the two forge.

Is Season One of XENA great television?  No.  In fact, it is pretty bad, but it is important to keep in mind that it would get better.  Is it important television?  Yes, because XENA, along with THE X-FILES in 1993 and BUFFY in 1997 signaled the emergence of the female hero on television.  In large part we have such female characters on TV as Aeryn Sun, Max Guevera, Sydney Bristow, Kate Austen, River Tam, and Veronica Mars to the paths blazed by Dana Scully, Xena, and Buffy Summers.",1184457600,7,6948,4.758563074352548
1836363,5,B00008DDWV,"Episodes were almost all the same. walk through the woods, someone needs help, fight a petty wannabe warlord. However, Xena had great costumes, wonderful cinematography, interesting characters. Sometimes episodes were silly and corny, but sometimes they were serious and touching. Xena has the right touch of humor, action and drama. I love it! Sometimes the seasons are ""buy 1 get 1 free"". wait and get a deal.

It's suprising that by today's standards that some feminist hail Xena as a legitimate female action figure, who represents the courage and strength that women possess. Back in the 1990's I think women saw her as a big boobed bimbo. However today we can look back and see someone both beautiful and strong. She certainly isn't a bimbo by todays standards.",1175385600,,767,4.9921875

If people are in trouble and can't defend themselves, they can rest peacefully knowing that Xena will unselfishly risk her own life to protect and defend them.  She keeps us safe from all the evil we can't even imagine.  Most of the episodes have a good story with a happy ending.  Seasons 1 and 2 were the most realistic and believable.

1836397,5,B00008DDWV,"After finishing watching Xena for the first time in years, I found myself enjoying it a bit more than when it first came out.

The best things about Xena: 1) is her character.  2) Yes, I'll admit it, being a guy, two beautiful women stars help too :).

Back to her character: She has a well-thought out, well-developed fullness.  She is rich, vibrant and dark.  She is far better than her counterpart, Hercules. She is a woman version of Batman, well, zans the cape and cowel.  She has personality, strength of character, she is quick thinking, above all, she is HUMAN.  She has problems, and she has human puzzles, obstacles to deal with.  When she can't use brute strength (though she uses it 80% of the time), she uses her WITS and her ability to be flexible to overcome her challenges.  (unlike Hercules, the brute strength man)

She has lots of redeeming features which I can't write down all in one review to make her a person well worthy to cheer for.

Xena's action is well done, and far more realistic than Hercules.  The serious overtone of the battles and Xena's atmosphere in general sinks in quite well.  The best action takes place when they set up fortifications and defense of towns and people, that shows her skills and strategies.  Heck, even Gabrielle shows her stuff.  It's got different quirks, and even puts the Heroes in different situations: like, when Gabrielle freezes in combat...I think that's realistic and WOW....shows the humanness of it all.  Or how even Xena or Gabrielle doesn't always have a solution to solve the problem in combat, or out of it.  Xena often thinks of ways on the fly.

Most of the plots and storylines were fine, and always entertaining.  I even liked the one where Gabrielle attends Bard school.  Though, I find HER very annoying, the episode was fun.

my favorite side characters had been and still are: Autolycus, the ""King of Thieves"", Salmoneus the merchant and Joxer ""the Mighty""  The chemistry between Autolycus works far better with Xena than Hercules.
they make the show's stars well worth watching...and even makes me want to buy the rest of the series so I can watch for those characters specifically.

Now, to the minor problems:
I didn't know the Gods were so weak and helpless.  Hera seemed much more deadly to me. She usually has better plots, guards to deal with such pesky heroes...:).

As for other Gods...
I don't recall the episode title, but when Death comes to the King's castle to ""claim"" him, he manages to capture her in a weak mechanical trap?

Hades, who is also a God, who can bring people to life and such, appeals Xena for help?  What???!  And, when Death is freed, she doesn't kill the old King who she came for in the first place? Did I miss something here?

Or, when Hades has his Helmet of Invisibility stolen...what, he can't stop a mortal?  Hmm. I guess I should brush up on my Greek mythology, but that just doesn't seem too all awe-inspiring to me.  I understand the Greek Gods were supposedly like humans in most aspects, but they were also very all powerful.  The only aspects in which they were humans, were their emotions, and pettiness.

Also, the Titans in the episode: The Titans.  I thought they had more power than just ""being big"".  Oh well, maybe that's just me.

But, on a lesser note, I couldn't STAND Gabrielle or Callisto.  Callisto is an overdone-over-cliched ""I hate the Heroine"" character, which needed to be fleshed out over seventeen episodes, WHY?  As if Xena doesn't have enough guilt to dwell over?

That said,
Xena is a far superior show than Hercules.",1159401600,3,3567,4.673633440514469
1836398,5,B00008DDWV,"Ok, so I'm a bigger Hercules fan than I am of Xena, but I love how these two shows collide sometimes.  So I saved up a boatload of money and bought them both at once after all seasons were released.  Season 1 of Xena has a few memorable moments.  For one thing, Kevin Smith portrays Ares for the first time.  I wasn't too thrilled with that monsterous incarnation of the war god in Hercules because I'd already gotten used to Smith's portrayal of the character.  And what a fantastic job on his part.  I also enjoyed the first appearance of Callisto.  She's creepy, but you can't help but feel sorry for her.  I also enjoyed the Herc and Xena crossover episode included this season as well.  It was an ok season, but I enjoyed later seasons a great deal more because Ares and Callisto had more important roles to play.  Not a bad first run, nonetheless.",1155340800,2,853,4.410256410256411

I started watching it with my mom when it started, and I was hooked from the beginning. Even I bought this set for $80 bucks and now its only $40 lol, it was still worth it.

The show does have the cheesy moments but it works for this show. I don't know if anyone else noticed, but Ive noticed only after I watched the DVD set a million times that there are funny disclaimers in the credits.

True Xena fans know of the infamous Gabrielle scrolls, well I have spent weeks, because I have no life lol, writing my own ""scrolls"" for this season:

SINS OF THE PAST- Feeling guilty of her evil past, Xena is giving up her fighting ways to return to her home town, Amphipolis. On her way home she encounters a army led by the warlord, Draco, attacking a village. Of course a battle ensues, and this is where Xena meets the talkative bard, Gabrielle, who wants to leave her peaceful, boring town, Poteidaia, and ride with Xena, but Xena rides alone. Before returning to Amphipolis, Xena uses her seductive skills to persuade Draco to leave Poteidaia alone. Draco always wanted Xena to ride with him, so he makes an offer, angry she refuses, Draco decides to attack Amphipolis because there is ""no rest for the wicked"". At Xena's return home, unbeknownst to her that Gabrielle is following her, it's not a warm welcome. No one wants her there, not even her own mother, Cyrene, because of her past. Learning of Draco's attack, Xena beats him in a final battle. Instead of killing him, she makes a deal for him never to return to Amphipolis, he accepts. Now with Gabrielle at her side, and forgiven by Cyrene, and the village, Xena heads back on the road to fight for the greater good.

CHARIOTS OF WAR- Defending a village from an army, Xena is wounded by an arrow. Now staying with the family, who's son she saved, which includes, the father, 2 sons and little girl who hasn't spoken since the death of her mother, Xena rests and builds her strength. The warlord, Cycnus, wants blood after finding out the woman warrior was Xena, because the death of his son. His younger son, Sphaerus, wants peace and doesn't have the killer instinct. After meeting Gabrielle, Sphaerus truly shows his good side in the end, standing up against his father's orders. Xena defeats Cycnus and the village is now safe. The little girl finally speaks, not wanting to lose Xena, but Xena must carry on.

DREAMWORKER- ""Wisdom before weapons"" is the lesson Xena teaches when Gabrielle wants to learn how to defend herself. Xena and Gabrielle come into a town that's deserted, of women, and everyone has their eyes on little innocent Gabrielle, including the followers' of Morphius (God of Dreams). Gabrielle is taken to be chosen to be the bride of Morphius. She has to survive 3 tests, they only want one thing from these tests, for Gabrielle to lose her blood innocence, and if she does, she will be sacrificed. Xena visits an ex-mystic to help her save Gabrielle. Xena has to fight her own dreamscape of her past, she fights her way through and of course saves the day, and Gabrielle keeps her innocence.

CRADLE OF HOPE- King Gregor was fated by an old crone that a servant's son will one day take the throne. The King's advisor, Nemos, only has one thing on his mind, to kill the child, no matter the King's orders. The baby was sent down a river, by a servant, to save his life, and falls into the hands of Xena and Gabrielle. They soon encounter Pandora, the grand-daughter of the infamous Pandora, and now keeper of the cursed box. Nemos has the whole town looking for the baby and gets a little taste of the warrior princess, but she doesn't hold them back from stealing Pandora's box. Little do they know, without Pandora there to watch over and keep the box locked, it will open on it's own at midnight, and all hope will escape. Knowing that King Gregor wasn't a bad man, Xena figures out the prophecy and informs him that the child wil take the throne as his heir, not his conquerer. Xena then defeats Nemos, Pandora finally has a home and peace at last. Gabrielle accidentally knocks the box over and it opens, only it's empty. Mankinds' hope will always be safe.

DISCLAIMER- No babies were harmed.

THE PATH NOT TAKEN- Xena has to travel to a place she never though she would, the town of Trachus, known for cut throats and assassins. She is hired to save a princess, who was abducted by Mezentius, an arm's dealer. Playing her part as the old evil Xena, she runs into her old love, Marcus, making it harder to stop a war between 2 nations, which will begin if the princess isn't returned. Getting on the good side of Mezentius, Xena figures out a way to get the princess out, but it stopped by Marcus. Xena defeats Mezentius, Marcus turns good, but not before he is killed by an arrow, protecting the princess. Nations are safe, Xena and Gabrielle go on their way.

THE RECKONING- After defending helpless villagers against a mysterious hooded man, who disappears, 3 of the villagers die, and one if left badly injured. Other villagers show up too late and blame Xena for the deaths. Now on trial for the murders, the villagers want her blood. The hooded man, turns out to be Ares (God of War) framed Xena, in order to persuade her into returning and being his warrior queen again. With Ares talking to her and villagers beating her, Xena snaps and starts beating the villagers. In the heat of the moment, Gabrielle shows up and gets back-handed in the face by her beloved friend, thus bringing Xena back to her rightful state of mind. Ares makes a deal with Xena to bring back anyone she wants if she is found guilty, Xena accepts. No matter what happened, Gabrielle comes back and defends Xena, trying to prove her innocence. Being found guilty, Xena manipulates the deal and calls upon the 3 dead villagers, thus proving her innocence. Gabrielle gets back at Xena by punching her in the arm, making them both feel better.

THE TITANS- After tangling Argo's reigns and Xena taking off, Gabrielle overhears something in a cave. Gabrielle correctly reads a Dorian chant, and much to her surprise awakens 3 titans from being encased in stone, making Gabrielle the great liberator, virgin goddess. Gabrielle using the titans to do good for the town, abuses her power. After the titans find out they are working for a mortal, they vow to kill anyone until they get Gabrielle, they need her to read another chant that will awaken hundreds of ""sleeping"" titans. After being hurt by Xena treating her like a child, Gabrielle sneaks into the cave to find the chant that will turn the titans back to stone, but is captured by the titans. Using her fine ability to talk, Gabrielle stalls and reads the chant, to awaken the titans, wrong. Battling Hyperiun, the Sun Titan, Xena reads off the chant to Gabrielle, and Gabrielle manages to turn them back to stone. Though Gabrielle makes mistakes, Xena can always forgive her.

PROMETHEUS- Learning Prometheus has been chained by the Gods, Xena visits an oracle and learns in order to free Prometheus, she must go to the Cave of Hephaestus and retrieve a sword. Without Prometheus, mankind loses the gifts he gave them, the gift of fire, and the ablilty to heal, one scratch can now kill you. After retrieving the Sword of Hephaestus, Xena is confronted by Hercules, and Gabrielle meets Iolaus. With Xena and Hercules arguing who gets to free Prometheus, Iolaus and Gabrielle are confused, until they learn whoever breaks the chains with the sword, the will turn to ash, it's a suicide mission. Iolaus was wounded in a fight, and while Xena and Hercules are figuring out how to free Prometheus, Gabrielle takes care of him. Xena and Hercules work together and are able to free Prometheus, and the gifts of mankind are returned. Xena and Hercules, Gabrielle and Iolaus say their good-byes, and carry on their seperate ways.

DISCLAIMER- Iolaus was harmed, however, the Green Egg Men went on to live long and prosperous lives.

DEATH IN CHAINS- ""Another wasted death"", Xena declares after she kills Toxeus, a leader of a group of raiders. Little does she know, Toxeus just gets up and walks away. Hades (God of the Underworld), pays Xena a visit, asking her to save his sister, Celesta, if her flame dies out, no one will die and enternal suffering will follow, for she is Death. Death is being held by King Sisyphus, he was called to die, but captures Death instead. Gabrielle meets someone in which she has a lot in common, a good man named Talus. Gabrielle and Talus follow Xena into the castle, and they are followed by Toxeus and his men. In the end, Talus and Xena convince King Sisyphus to free Death, but not before Toxeus and his men try to stop Xena from freeing Death, but Xena succeeds and Death is free. Death puts an end to the ""evil that was Toxeus"", but instead of taking King Sisyphus, as originally planned, someone else needed her, Talus. Gabrielle and Talus share a painful good-bye, and Talus is relieved by Death.

DISCLAIMER- No Jumbo-Sized Cocktail Rats were harmed.

HOOVES & HARLETS- Xena and Gabrielle are welcoming into the land of the Amazons, after Gabrielle risks her life to save the Amazon Princess, Terreis, where Gabrielle recieves Terreis' Ride of Caste before she died, which makes Gabrielle the new Amazon Princess. A Centaur and son of Tyldus, Phantes is accused of the murder and is sent to execution at noon the next day, which will result in an all out war between the Amazons and Centaurs. Xena knows Phantes is innocent and a warlord named Krykus is responsible. Before the war begins, Xena fights the Amazon Queen, Melosa, in the Royal Challenge, as Gabrielles champion, and succeeds. Phantes is released and the Amazons and Centaurs work together and defeat Krykus. An uneast peace is formed between the Amazons and Centaurs, and Gabrielle finally learned how to defend herself.

DISCLAIMER- No males, Centaurs, or Amazons were harmed.

THE BLACK WOLF- After learning an old friend, Flora, had joined the Black Wolf pack, and was thrown into Xerxes' dungeon, who is a murderous tyrant, Xena goes undercover and convinces Xerxes that she will give him the Black Wolf. Now in the dungeon, Xena works out how to get Flora out of there, but Flora won't leave without the whole wolf pack. The first escape attempt fails and no one trusts Xena anymore.

Orion's overbearing father tells the advisors about Gabrielle sneaking into the competition, and she is kicked out.

The thing is, Xena isn't interested in the treasure, only she knows about the Trojan Key, which leads to ambrosia (food of the Gods, if eaten, a mortal becomes a God). They figure out the clues and find the treasure. Therasites ends up finding the Trojan Key and figures it out, kidnaps Gabrielle and goes on this way to the ambrosia. Therasites kills Petricles, Xena kills Therasites, and before Petricles passes over, he hands Xena a pouch and inside is their wedding bracelet, she though he had gotten rid of, and apologizes for the way he had treated her.

This whole riot began when Atyminius, a vicious murderer who specialized in killing brides before their wedding by cutting them into peices, stole Hades' Helmet of Invisibility and confined Hades with Harpies as guards. While visiting with Hades, Xena and Marcuse find out when Atyminius goes back to the mortal land, the helmet will make him mortal again, and can once again be killed, Hades also gives Marcus his life back for 48 hours so he can help Xena.

Upon returning home, Gabrielle learns that the warlord, Damon, has been looting her town every couple of months. The peaceful town of Poteidaia has hired a warrior, Meleager the Mighty, who has quite a reputation, to defend their town from Damon. With Gabrielle's sister, Lila, mad at her for leaving, and jealous of the closeness of her and Xena, Gabrielle helps Meleager out with strategies, the only problem is, Meleager is more interested in getting drunk. When the big day comes to fight against Damon, Meleager and the money from the town is gone. The town is ready to give up, but learning many things from traveling with Xena, Gabrielle steps up. At the last minute, Meleager returns with better weapons, which he used to money for, and defeats Damon and his men. With Meleager's vow to stay sober and making amends with Lila, Gabrielle returns to Xena, where she truly belongs.

Xena figures out that Maell, jealous of Icus, has been drugging his father with Henbane in nut bread, to convince his father, that his voice was god's, which Gabrielle eats and is drugged and hearing voices. Icus realizes that he should be sacrificed if it was the will of god. After defeating Maell, Xena makes it to the altar just in time, but before she strikes, a loud vouce tells the father to stop the sacrifice. Xena tells Gabrielle that her voice in the ""loud talking thing"" was very impressive, only Gabrielle never reached it...

DISCLAIMER- No unrelenting or severely punishing Deities were harmed.

TIES THAT BIND- After Xena helps out an older warrior from guards, when he was trying to free slave girls, he reveals to Xena he is her father, Atrius, but Xena isn't buying into it. Slowly accepting that Atrius is her father, he joins Xena and Gabrielle in returning the girls back to their town, Locia. When Gabrielle sees him murder a surrenderer, she doesn't trust him. On the way back to Locia, Atrius has a talk with Gabrielle, and she realizes she must leave Xena, so Xena can be with her father. When they reach Locia, the towns people capture because of what he did to them in the past. Learning that Kirilus' army was about to attack, Xena rides away to stop them. Xena defeats Kirilus and the army is now hers. Upon returning to Locia, Xena sees her father badly beaten and decides to destroy the village. With Xena's mind clouded with hatred, Gabrielle stands up to her with no avail and ends up striking Xena in the back with a pitch fork. Realizing her father is okay, Xena comes to her sense, but Atrius tries talking her into killing the villagers. A confused Xena stands looking at her father, as he turns into Ares. Ares disguised himself as Xena's father to make it easier for her to rejoin him. Xena denies him once again and rides away with Gabrielle.

THE GREATER GOOD- Xena was asked to defend a town and Lord Seltzer from the warlord, Talmadeous. Lord Seltzer turns out to be none other than Salmoneus, which this time he invents carbonated water. While fighting Talmadeous' men, Xena was struck in the neck by a poisonous dart, from a mysterious person. Talmadeous is after Salmoneus because he had sold Talgamite metal, which dissolves if it gets wet, and Talmadeous lost a battle. Getting weaker by the poison, Xena has Gabrielle dress up like her to convince Talmadeous she's fine, but it only works for awhile. Gabrielle worried about Xena and confused why Xena isn't thinking of herself at a time like this, is told by Xena it's all part of the greater good, and has Gabrielle promise to bring Xena's body back to Amphipolis so she can be buried next to her brother. When Gabrielle returns from a tent attack against Talmadeous, she finds out Xena has in fact died. Filled with anger and Sadness, she decides to focus on the greater good, and protect the town. Salmoneus goes to Talmadeous and gives him Xena's body and himself, in exchange for the safety of the villagers. Gabrielle stands up to Talmadeous, but is captured.

CALLISTO- While Xena is sitting down for a drink, she is met by Malus, when he finds out her name, he attacks, wanting to kill her for murdering his whole village, including his 6 year old son. Confused what is going on, Xena and Gabrielle head toward Corrinthe. Defending a village from a warrior woman, Callisto, who matches Xena's skill and knows her every move. Callisto was the one who had shot Xena with the dart, which made it easier for Callisto to destroy Xena's reputation by raiding villages in Xena's name. After taking Xena's chakram, Callisto takes off, but not before mentioning Cirrha, the town Xena had destroyed once before, killing Callisto's family. This makes Xena more determined to stop her. After being rejected by Xena, Joxer, a clumsy, idiotic, warrior-wannabe, goes to Callisto to offer his services, in which Callisto orders him to kidnap the ""irritating blonde"" Gabrielle, but Gabrielle beats him down everytime. Knowing Callisto's plan to murder the oracle at the Delphi and put the blame on Xena, Xena manages to capture her. Malus full of hatred and wanting Callisto's blood, form a lynch mob and starts a fire in her holding cell. Xena saving her, Callisto escapes and kidnaps Gabrielle. Joxer unable to kill Gabrielle is also tied up. Gabrielle hung in the air, to fall to her death when the fire burns through the rope holding her, Xena makes a balance bar with ladders to save her, all the while fighting Callisto at the same time. Xena saves Gabrielle and also saves Callisto from what she wants most, her own death and Callisto and her men are incarcerated.

DEATH MASK- Gabrielle wants to learn how to catch arrowns like Xena, feeling it with her body, she manages to stop one from hitting Xena, still unsure how she did it.

With the war finally over, the healing Gabrielle tells Xena about her ""dream"" about being in the Elysian Feilds.

DISCLAIMER- Being that war is hell, lots of people were harmed, but since television is a dramatic medium of make believe, all casualties removed their prothestic make-up and went home unscathed.

Well I hope you enjoyed my scrolls, lol, all in all this is a good season, and I don't get what others are complaining about, the grain isn't that bad at all, and I have no problems with the audio, buy better equipment I guess. My favorite episodes include: Fistful of Dinars, Callisto, and Is There a Doctor in the House. Awesome season fianle, I actually cried.

The non-existent subtitles do suck I agree, but it's a must have Xena collection.

One other thing I don't understand is all the people that didn't like the show and reviewed about it, why spend all that time watching it then?? der.",1147219200,8,28517,4.705811623246493
1836403,5,B00008DDWV,"Xena was always my favorite, don't get me wrong, Hercules is great too but Xena is better. I'm on the third season of Hercules and already the first season of Xena has a noticabley better budget than Hercules. Perk of being married to the producer? maybe....

This season is probably the best of Xena because it's alittle bit more light-hearted (except that one Calisto part with Gabrielle). Xena is pretty cool, lol, those stunts she can pull off....

Sam Raimi definitely ups the cheesiness but that's fine with me. At least the acting isn't sooo bad, although it does have it's moments...",1142467200,3,591,4.784313725490196

I watched it off and on till about season 5. every friday night on WB.  I got back into it a few years ago when they showed it daily on oxygen.  Anyways, i bought the season 1 about a year and a half ago and watch it often.  It brings back good memories.  Xena may not be completely accurate, but its action packed, witty and just plain entertaining.  I could watch these episodes over and over again and I am still entertained.

1836405,5,B00008DDWV,I picked up the first season box set and I think its great.  I read the online reviews after I picked it up and wanted to see what the problem w/ the DVD was when I read about the poor quality.  So I went to the Death In Chains episode and it was fine.  The pic was a little bit grainy but thats because of the cameras they were using first and part of second season.  If you watch the bonus disc it tells you they were going for a grittier look so they used 16mm instead of 35mm camera's.  None of it was dark like it said in someone's review.  The picture was just as good as it was when it first aired in 1995.  Its a great show and the DVD's are worth picking up.  My only complaint is that they are a little pricey compared to a lot of other shows these days.,1136505600,3,764,3.8525641025641026

My memories of season one were gone but what a surprise to watch the old times again! The sound, the stunts, the adventure, the thrills, everything made my purchase all worthwile. For some, the Xena series may be odd and somewhat distorted from ancient Greek legends, but looking aside from that, the show itself is a fun and entertaining addition to other adventure shows and movies.",1131926400,4,685,4.444444444444445

1836454,5,B00008DDWV,"If you are a fan of fantasy, or of ""Buffy:  The Vampire Slayer,"" then this is one television series that does the genre justice.  ""Xena:  Season One"" was simply amazing!  I watched the whole series from the very beginning when it was on the air, and I fell in love with it.

Xena was introduced to the North American public in 1995, and starred the beautiful and very talented Lucy Lawless as Xena, and Renee O'Connor as lovely, spirited Gabrielle.  The entire series was shot in the gorgeous New Zealand countryside (Think ""Lord of the Rings"").  In the first season Xena is determined to attone for the wrongs she committed in the past as a lethal warrior and leader of her own army.  She is an extraordinary woman with ""The strength of 10 men,"" military knowledge, a vast repitoire of fighting skills and even some experience as a healer.  Along the way she meets Gabrielle, a courageous, outspoken young woman from a small village who manages to convince Xena to take her along on her journeys.  Xena and Gabrielle travel throughout ""Greece"" and encounter some nasty warlords, the God of War, the Amazons, the King of Thieves, a beautiful and vengeful female warrior, and others while developing a strong friendship that will stand the test of time.

The stories are immensely entertaining and memorable.  Xena's transformation into a warrior who fights for goodness, and Gabrielle's transformation into a warrior are wonderful to watch mainly because of the superb perfomances of Lawless and O'Connor.  But, what is great about these two heroines is that they are still only human, regardless of their skills and talents (Xena in particular).  They get hurt, they lose loved ones, they fall in love, they laugh and cry.  Each episode has action, but they also contain a good story as well, and some of the best character development you will see in a long time.

The whole Xena series brought dignity and respect back into the suffering action genre.  The vibrant performances from the two female leads, as well as from several other characters who will become regulars throughout the series, coupled with excellent writing and music, good action choreography, and the amazing New Zealand backdrop have made this a huge success.  The only complaint I have about this boxed set is the sub-par picture quality.  It is not terrible, but it could have been better.  Other than that, this is an A+ action/fantasy series that is worth every penny!",1113523200,10,2445,4.859903381642512

If you don't recognize the above, you've been in a distant land since at least 1995, and this review isn't really for you.  But you should buy this collection immediately, because you're in for an entirely novel treat.
Xena: Warrior Princess is a spin-off series from ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"", which followed 5 ""Action Pack"" (don't ask) Hercules movies.  The Hercules and Xena stories are revisionist tales of antiquity.  Most of the names are right (""Hercules"" instead of ""Herakles"", and the Roman ""Cupid"" instead of Greek ""Eros"" are notable exceptions), but anachronisms abound.  We first see Xena sitting on her horse, complete with stirrups (1000 years before their invention) and saddle horn (2000 years early).  Xena's sword is bronze, but steel implements abound in an era when Indian Wootz steel was a commodity valued above gold.  The wet countryside of New Zealand doubles for the dry Mediterranean clime of Greece.  And barbarian warriors look suspiciously like Maori.  Obviously the emphasis is on entertainment rather than historical accuracy.  It's a good thing, too, because the entertainment value is outstanding.
The premise of the series is that Xena was a teenager living in the Greek village of Amphipolis when it was attacked.  She rallied her neighbors to mount a successful defense.  Then she took the surrounding towns to have a defensive perimeter.  One thing led to another, and Xena was a warlord terrorizing the countryside.  But, true to her original intent, she spared defenseless women and children.  When her underlings thought that made her soft she broke from them, and began an epic quest for redemption.  Soon after this she met Gabrielle, a young villager whose community is raided.  With ambitions exceeding her small town's reach Gabrielle decides to follow Xena on her travels.
Xena is a mythic hero.  Lacking the godly strength of Hercules, she nevertheless matches him in battle by virtue of superhuman agility.  Plus, as she says, ""I have many skills"" -- including tactics, strategy, eastern martial arts, horsemanship, medicine, and singing.  Xena is at the top of her form when we first see her.  In sharp contrast to this we watch Gabrielle as she transforms from quick-witted but unsophisticated villager to wannabe bard to reluctant warrior.
Lucy Lawless got an early entry into the Hercules/Xena universe; she played Lysia in ""Hercules and the Amazon Women"", the very first of the movies that preceded the ""Hercules"" series.  In fact this earlier role was a strike against her when trying out for the part of Xena in the ""Hercules"" series.  But hair dye, boots with lifts, and skin bronzer transformed Lucy Lawless (5' 10 1/2"", light brown hair, pale skin) to Xena (6' tall, brown-black hair, olive complexion).  Add in a passable American accent, and this native New Zealander carried off the role of an Americanized Greek mythic hero with aplomb.  When you see Xena riding at the gallop or trading blows with a foe that's really Lucy Lawless; when Xena is tumbling through the air it's a stunt performer.
Renee O'Connor also got an early start; she played an earlier version of Deianeira, Hercules' wife, in ""Hercules and the Lost Kingdom"", the second Hercules movie, before landing the role of Gabrielle.  In the first season of X:WP O'Connor is listed as ""also starring"", after the title; only Lawless gets ""starring"" billing.
Various continuing characters from ""Hercules"" appear in Season One of X:WP:
- Kevin Smith as Ares, God of War
- Kevin Sorbo as Hercules
- Michael Hurst as Iolaus (Hercules' sidekick); also as Charon
- Robert Trebor as Salmoneus, mercurial merchant
- Bruce Campbell as Autolycus, King of Thieves
- Erik Thomson as Hades, God of the Underworld
Season One of Xena introduced a number of new faces that would become familiar:
- Danielle Cormack as Ephiny, Amazon warrior
- Paul Norell as Falafel, food stand vendor
- Karl Urban, who would appear again in seasons 2+ as Julius Caesar
- Hudson Leick as Callisto, nemesis extraordinaire
- Ted Raimi as Joxer, bumbling would-be warrior
More notable one-shot guest stars from Season One included:
- Kate Hodge as Celesta, Goddess of Death
- Galyn G""rg as Helen of Troy
- Tim Thomerson as Meleager the Mighty
- Peter McCauley as Talmodeus
Season One of X:WP was shot on 16mm film to keep production costs down, so the DVD video transfer is no better than you'd expect.  The audio is quite a bit better, including outstanding music by Joseph LoDuca.  The Xena theme, in particular, is a wonderful mix of bouzouki, french horns, and strings to mix traditional Greek sounds with the stirring European classical melodies we've come to associate with inspirational themes.
The 7-disc Season One collection is remarkable mostly for what it DOESN'T have.  There are NO extras in the Season One DVDs AT ALL.  Each of the 24 episodes is 44 minutes 15 seconds or less.  There are no DVD or CC captions.  There are no extra chapter stops; each episode has 5 or 6 chapters.  The 7th disc is a CD-ROM, with rather unremarkable content.  There are no printed guides in the set.
6 DVDs, with 4 episodes each; 24 total episodes
1 CD-ROM:
- Screensaver
- Cast & Director bios
- ""Scrolls"" - episode cast lists, guest stars (""mortals"" and ""gods""), search through the scrolls text
- Season One trivia game
Xena: Warrior Princess is a fun, butt-kicking action series.  It's a shame that the DVD collection of Season One is both low on extra content and high on price.",1077753600,135,5703,4.914405010438413
1836498,5,B00008DDWV,"Hi everyone the Xena season 3 on DVD was realeased on 10th Feb.
The 3rd season is the most memorable and best crafted, including: the season opener, The Furies, wherein Xena's recurring foil, the god Ares, has her driven insane; Been There, Done That.
The video details are crisp and the colors vivid. All things considered, this is probably as good of a transfer as Xena will ever get, sharper and easier on the eyes than most action TV programs, and, for that matter, looking better than it originally appeared during on television.
The sound is on Dolby 5.1. Season three also has more than nine hours of new material. Each of the 22 episodes has an Interview segment with comments from writers, producers, actors and sometimes all three. Several standout programs -- including The Furies, The Debt, One Against An Army and The Bitter Suite -- also have full-blown voice-over commentary following throughout the episode. There is also a  documentary which  includes a short tribute to the late Kevin Smith, who played Ares.
There's more than enough in this set to please everyone who cares about the show .

I thought the show was far more superior to Hercules as a spin off show. The difference with Xena is that this show delivers all the right punches at the right time. Xena (and Hercules) both represented a new departure in television as well. So, if you enjoy camp, adventure or just want to escape from reality for awhile this is fun show and Xena shows always end up on a happy note.

1836550,3,B00008DDWV,"I enjoy Hercules and Xena very much BUT, there are a few things that really bugged the heck out of me on Xena's Season One.
First off, like previous reviews have stated, about half way through two of the episodes, the voices start to get out of hand and don't match the lip movements.  If there are things I cannot stand it's bad dubbing.  I don't think Anchor Bay should have any excuse for this ""mishap"".
Another thing, is the picture can get grainy in some parts, especially in some of the earlier episodes.  But, in part, I do blame the type of film they were using during part of this season.
Lastly, there are no captions or subtitles.  I was sitting here thinking ""What the heck!  This is the ONLY thing I own on VHS or DVD that does not have captions!""  I'm grateful Anchor Bay released this, but my word, what were they thinking! I know several people who would have a fit over this one reason.
These are the type of things that are NOT easily ignorable. I've got every reason to get my money back from Best Buy until Anchor Bay releases newer editions with at least the voice problem fixed.  Like I said, I'm grateful, but let's get it together, OK?
I can only hope that that Xena's Season Two will be improved and that Hercules' Season One is really worth my money.",1062201600,3,1276,4.336134453781512
1836551,4,B00008DDWV,"I bought this DVD set thinking that I'd have problems with the image quality - but there was none at all!  It was all crisp and clear, with good colors. If you have a decent DVD player, you shouldn't have a problem.
Season One of Xena: The Warrior Princess is action-packed, and introduces a lot of the favorite characters that recur in later seasons... Xena and Gabrielle, of course, but also Ares, Joxer the Mighty, Callisto, and let's not forget the Amazons.
The only problem I have with this set is that some of the episodes seem to be out of order. Unless you're a hardcore fan, however, you probably won't notice, and I still am just glad to have it on DVD.
I'm giving this four stars because it's not quite perfect. Also, you might want to wait until they release the new Season One DVDs that will include commentary on three episodes (there's already commentary on the upcoming Season Two).",1061510400,8,898,4.54320987654321

Many hardcore...and deaf, xena fans just like myself were disappointed, really disappointed, and season 2 shows no different. For you deaf people out there, do NOT get it! Unless you like just watching the action and not understanding or being able to see Xena's wisdom in caption, or subtitle, just like the hearing people can.",1061424000,9,667,4.387096774193548
1836553,5,B00008DDWV,"At last, Xena is on digital heaven! Fans of the Warrior Princess had to stick to VHS for too long. It was embarrassing to see shows like Dawson's Creek and Felicity get DVD treatment while we still had those horrible tapes.
Season 1 of Xena was not perfect, everybody knows that. The show had a hard time separating itself from Hercules, and still had a lot of work to be done. Yes, it was cheesy, and yes, sometimes it became silly, but I think that was one of its best features. The good thing about Xena is that it had something for everybody. You could just enjoy the action, or the pretty ladies in provocative outfits, or the ""Three Stooges""-like humor, or the incredible friendship between the two leading characters, or even the philosophy behind them. Hell, you could just watch it as a plain sword&sorcery show and you' would be happy. It's hard to say, since Xena meant something different for everybody. For me, it was one of the most intelligent and well-done TV series I've ever seen in my entire life. Of these first episodes, I have to say that my favorites are ""Dreamworker"" (the first one I ever saw), ""The Royal Couple of Thieves"" (with the EXCELLENT Bruce Campbell as a Autolycus, one of the best characters) and ""Callisto"", which introduced one the most popular TV villains of all time.
Now, for the edition, A lot of people have complained to the picture quality of this set (especially when you compare it to the excellent DVD package of Hercules released this year), and I think I have the reason. You have to remember that XWP was a show that took its time to win over an audience. Since it was a series on a trial period, they didn't spend too much money on it, so they filmed the first two seasons (and two episodes of the third) in 16mm. I don't know if you've ever seen it, but 16mm is very cheap and doesn't transfer that nicely to digital media (see also ""Army of Darkness""). Hercules, on the other hand, was always filmed in 35mm, that's movie-like quality. I guarantee that Xena would look MUCH better by Season 3. Anyway, I don't see what the fuzz is all about because it still looks much better than my cable ever did.
My only complaint is the lack of extras. A few audio commentaries would've been nice, and the show deserved it, as well as some subtitles. I mean, it's not even closed-captioned, and that was a big mistake. Personally, I hate it when they go cheap and put all the special features in a CD-ROM. At least, however, the set is not terribly overpriced, like the Star Trek: The Next Generation sets.
I've let it all go because I finally have Xena on DVD. For that alone I say thanks, and I know that it will be a hit. Now I only have to wait for the rest of the Season sets and I will be a happy man.",1059264000,6,2749,4.38160469667319
1836554,3,B00008DDWV,"The seven piece picture gatefold is done quite nice, each with a picture from a highlight of the episode on each disc. The entire set is housed in a slip case with a picture of Xena that showcases her look of danger and excitement and is a nice touch in introducing the earlier stories of Xena's adventures. The menus are quite interactive. Each episode selection has a moving picture from the episode itself to help guide to viewer. The background shows fire in motion, and any menu done in motion is definately better than the static ones. The original Xena theme, with all the lyrics plays in the background, is a nice touch. Each episode is broken up in chapters, again with thumbnails to help the viewer. The picture quality, as many fans have pointed out, can be quite horrid, especially for the first three quarters of the season's episodes. The amount of grain present in the video is so great that it literally seems like you are watching the show through a veil. As a result, the Mpeg-2 compression can not handle this level of grain and the picture quality suffers; every minute detail in the picture becomes 'blocky'. Motion artifacts are even worst, it's like watching a scene disolving into another. I watched the dvds on my flat screen HDTV, which has a feature that doubles the level of detail, but it also doubles the amount of video noise, grain and motion artifacts. On the plus side, effort was put into improving the brightness and color of the video and I can tell you that it really helped when it came to dark interior scenes or bright outdoor ones. The dark scenes were improved with low-light details and outdoor scenes produced the lush, saturated look of New Zealand's greenery. Hope is not totally lost though, as I found that by the time you get to episode 19, 'Altared States', the level of video noise and digital artifacts had decreased substantially; it was only noticable during scenes that involved lots of movement. Things improved further in episode 20, 'Tie's That Bind'. I can honestly say that, except for the small amount of video noise associated with most tv produced shows, there was virtually no grain and digital artifacting of any kind. With these improvements, they lead me to think of one of three conclusions: 1)The original video masters were not taken care of properly (a very common problem for most shows produced before the DVD era) and this is especially true for Season 1 of many shows; or 2)There was not enough space on the dvd for the video to be encoded at a 'healthy' rate (for example, Warner decided to encode six episodes of 'Friends' on a dual layered dvd, which contains only about 150 minutes of video, allowing a high bit-rate for the best presentation, versus Xena, containing four episodes of 300 minutes of video on each dual layered disc, of which it probably had problems of video noise and grain already inherent in the video masters); or 3)Who ever supervised the video transfers (it was neither Rob Tapert or Sam Rami, they were not involved in this set in any way) just didn't do a good job. Either way, with episode 19 showing a good potential of things to come, perhaps the video quality will improve by the time Season 2 is released. Most people know that this set Anchor Bay released is the duplicate of what Davis-Panzer Merchandising Corp. released last year on their own web site. Whether Anchor Bay improved the video and the audio of this set is unsure, and we will know when Season 2 is released. The audio on the other hand is great, for a tv show. Remixed in 5.1, the sound is a lot more expansive than when it was shown on cable. Strange thing is that a couple of episodes are mixed in full 448kbps, whereas most others are mixed in 384kbps. Extras are minimal, a cd-rom is included to provide the viewer with some actor and director bios, a trivia, a screensaver and the Xena Chronicles, which catagorizes each character on Season 1. A small photo gallery in included on Disc 1. As mentioned before, there was no involvement from anybody that was directly related to the show when this box set was produced, as the rights were sold to Davis-Panzer Merchandising Corp. However, Anchor Bay has stated that they will try to get Rob and Sam, and as well as lead actresses Lucy and Renee to participate on commentaries on future seasons. [On a perculiar note, for some reason, my set came with a 7th dvd (in additional to the cd-rom) that contained the 60 minute documentary 'What You Didn't Know About Xena - a featurette from the directors of Season 1', and I can tell you, it's quite informative, if nostalgic].
On a side note, I viewed my original 'Xena Trilogy' dvd from Univeral and the video quality was excellent, with not a slightest hint of dirt, noise or artifacts in sight. The three episode arc was encoded at a higher bit rate though (191 minutes on a dual layered disc), which explains the great presentation, but it does not explain why the newer, later Season 1 of Xena could look so much inferior to its original successor. Perhaps Univeral retained the superior video masters and 'lent' Davis-Panzer the less the stellar ones? Let's hope that Season 2 will look much better and beginning with Season 3, Anchor Bay will ensures that the show will be presented in Anamorphic Widescreen.",1058659200,6,5291,4.6598930481283425
1836555,3,B00008DDWV,"I agree with the other reviewers.  It is great to be able to enjoy Xena's First Season and Lucy Lawless in all her glory! The first season finds the series still looking for an overall look and a direction, and you will have to wait for Season Three and Further Seasons for truly mythological storytelling and pathos.
My only complaint is ,of course, the total lack of special features of this Anchor Bay DVD edition.  IT lacks alternate comment sound tracks, or documentaries, etc.  One MAJOR miss is that NONE of the episodes are close-captioned (this is strange because when they were originally broadcast, they were...!).  Maybe Anchor Bay will correct this in future Xena seasons'DVD releases.  The lack of extras and the lack of close-captioning is the only two reasons why I adjudicated 3 out of 5 stars to this DVD.
I did not experience any noticeable graininess or blurring when playing my DVD's on my Sony DVD player and viewing it on my Sony 32"" TV (not a new one, I might add).  I have not tried watching the DVD's on my computer, but it has been my experience that DVDs do not play back with the same quality on DVD-enabled computers.

1836626,2,B00008DDWV,"I'm a big fan of Xena and i only have to say one negative thing about this DVD and that would be that they did not include subtitles. Almost every popular tv series on DVD has subtitles and why would they not, they must be cheapies. Subtitles do a lot of help if the sound is bad or if there are deaf people out there that want to watch it too and they are stuck with not buying their favorite tv series on DVD. Plus, i think they could sell more copies for including subtitles. Hopefully, in the near future subtitles will be included in their other Season sets or this will be a big disappointment not only for me but many other people out there.",1058140800,4,648,4.150793650793651

1836628,3,B00008DDWV,"I was thrilled to receive my Xena Season 1 DVDs, but have also found the poor picture quality really irritating.  I'm also using a brand-new, high-end progressive scan DVD player, but with an older, ""interlace"" TV.  I realize progressive scan is basically meaningless in this context; I guess that makes all the difference.  The darker scenes are so grainy as to be unwatchable -- as in, I literally can't make out the actors' faces -- but even the bright, outdoor scenes look like they were filmed with a coating of vaseline over the lens.  I also noticed the lack of audio-video synchronization in ""The Titans.""  Of course, I'm chalking it all up to the general sense of cheesy fun that pervades this series, particularly the early seasons.  Overall, I'm still glad I bought the DVDs.",1055894400,6,786,4.785185185185185

That was truly irritating! I think this started about half way through - I watch the face expression of our heroes and they mouth the word, but the word does not come until a split second later....very distracting.

1836630,2,B00008DDWV,"Yes, it is true that season 1 was shot using 16mm film, and this film is of lesser resolution than 35mm and thus very grainy. It is also true that if one compresses such a source, one will get compression artifacts that will make the picture look even worse. However, the job of the DVD authors is to provide OPTIMAL compression, so the picture is as close to the original as possible. And if the DVD is to be digitally mastered, the picture quality has to be improved upon (not deteriorated!) to make it look as best as possible. There are ways to do this with any film source, if enough time is given. I have seen things restored from such poor quality that it was hard to believe. And besides, the time it took to get this DVD set out eliminates lack of time as an excuse.
Otherwise the DVD is not bad. The sound is adequate, and the packaging is nice. However, the picture quality is what is important. I only hope that this set will get a re-release so that the fans of this exellent show will not have to settle for this. I recommend that all complaints be taken to Sam Raimi directly.
Xena Not Dead!",1054857600,8,1106,4.271428571428571
1836631,4,B00008DDWV,"Anytime a series or movie shot on 16mm film--as Xena was in its first season--is released on DVD, complaints about the picture not being up to DVD standards of picture quality always seem to come up.
The problem is that DVD resolution is far greater than that of VHS or broadcast TV, and a series like Xena, shot on 16mm film in its low-budgeted first season, will show the limitations of its source material when transfered to DVD in a way broadcast TV and VHS never did.  16mm film has only about 1/3 of the resolution of 35mm film, which is the film format of choice for most shows shot for the American market.
Also, DVD compression depends on a good deal on much of the image remaining the same from one frame to another.  16mm film grain, by contrast, changes with every frame, which causes more changes in the image from frame to frame than with 35mm film--this is almost certainly why 16mm film grain can be worsened sometimes in the DVD encoding process, where the compression necessary for DVD, in effect converts the grain to DVD artifacting.  This is a complaint that's often been made regarding the DVD versions of 16mm movies, such as the first EVIL DEAD film.  Despite thier lower resolution, for this reason, VHS and Laserdisc were probably better mediums for transfers of 16mm material (because they used no compression).
However, as the past VHS releases of Xena in the US were never of very high quality (they tended to degrade quickly and have lots of glitches), and cost a lot more than these DVDs, and since DVD is the current format of choice, for durability, sound quality, and size, I suspect picture quality will always continue to be an issue with anything sourced from 16mm film.
If you love the series, you will probably be able to overlook this.  Consider too, that when Xena was first airing in 1995, most people were not watching it on the HUGE monitors that many people have today.  Xena was made to look good at broadcast resolution, on TV screens of 25 inches or less.
In any event, to save money, all of season one of Xena was shot in 16mm, and much of season two, but both contain many great episodes.  I'd say don't let excessive concerns about the picture quality being inferior to some other TV series (which, technically, it is) let you fail to enjoy this groundbreaking and innovative series.",1054252800,2,2334,4.609638554216867

I don't know what the quality of the sets on the Xena website is like but they can't be worse than this. I only hope that Anchor Bay gets it right the next time, and improves for Season 2, as well as the upcoming Hercules season. A terrible disappointment overall, don't listen to other reviews saying the video quality is great, you will be disappointed.",1053043200,2,617,4.237288135593221

The grain on the transfer is at times atrocious; like looking at a movie through your front porch screen door.  There are also no subtitles or closed captioning - funny, since at least the broadcasts were closed captioned.  I have friends who use this feature a lot for hearing issues and missed or difficult to understand dialogue - with a DVD release, you'd think they'd include at least ONE of these options.  And finally, the extra computer DVD with photos, trivia, mythology, etc. was really nice, but would have been a lot better if the disk had been usable in a regular DVD player.  I really enjoy having the episodes on DVD, but with a little more effort this would have been a far better release that what was published.",1052870400,3,843,4.624161073825503
1836704,3,B00008DDWV,"Back when a U.S. DVD release of Xena was still just an uncertain rumor, I got tired of waiting and bought a region-free player and ordered the series from a British website. I was extremely jealous, therefore, when I saw this set in the store until reading these reviews about the poor picture quality. For those who attribute the video problems to the cameras used in the first season, I don't think this is the explanation, as the quality is just fine on the R2 discs with no grainyness whatsoever. The contrast is also exceptional, compared side by side with my satellite, the picture is at least 3 times brighter uniformly. Unfortunately, the R2 version also is not closed-captioned, and is a bit pricier (each box only includes half a season and is only slightly less than this set of the whole season) with no extras, but I really just care about the show itself. It is a pity that Anchor dropped the ball, as Xena was a huge success with many fans and they deserve better.",1052784000,2,979,4.536723163841808
1836705,3,B00008DDWV,I have to agree with the dirty video comments. It's as if your looking through a screen door in some places. I cant say I've ever experienced this before in any video. Hopefully someone can come up with an explanation for this.,1052524800,4,227,4.428571428571429
1836706,2,B00008DDWV,"You'll cry your eyes out. No, not tears of joy, silly! It's the result of a 24-episode visit from the incredibly blinding ""Grain Monster"" of planet ""Anchor Bay Entertainment Butchered This Set"". If you were worried about not getting enough grain in your diet, folks, worry no longer. Yes, grain, grain, and more grain permeates every disc of this set like some kind of terrible, grainy plague. Remember the movie ""A Christmas Story"" when everyone told the kid, ""You'll shoot your eyes out""? Well, same deal here -- except in this case you'll WANT to shoot your eyes out after having received even only 3 seconds of this visually painful jolt to the old optic center of the brain. The audio is great, the content we all know and love is there, the packaging -- superb, but without good picture, who really cares, right? Buy it if you're a die-hard fan, otherwise, beware!",1052352000,4,870,4.69281045751634
1836707,2,B00008DDWV,"What some other reviews are calling ""film grain"" in this set is actually MPEG artifacting. The encoding on this set is so bad that you can't even SEE the film grain. On any large screen area of continuous color (skin, sky, etc.), you can see clear pixel patterns that don't shift as the camera or action shifts, especially on a larger TV. This DVD simply has the worst video encoding that I've ever seen. I watched the B5 Season 1 DVD set right before this, and had something to compare to. In contrast, that set had excellent encoding--good enough that you can see the the film grain and film scratches, and can tell the difference between scenes that are wide shots and those that were digitally zoomed (most of the effects shots). Moving to this DVD set was a real shock to the eyes, and this complete lack in video quality gives me the feeling that whoever was in charge just DID NOT CARE. I'm currently renting this set and would never buy it because of the poor encoding.
In conclusion: I would give the source material 4 stars, but the video encoding is so poor that the box set only gets 2 (buy it if you're desperate for Xena and are OK with sub-VHS quality).",1052352000,5,1168,4.412037037037037
1836708,5,B00008DDWV,"Seeing all the negative reviews of the Davis-Panzer produced DVDs, I was expecting a ""low end"" product from Anchor Bay - who are virtually just reissuing under their name.  I was pleasantly surprised with what I received.  Although the picture is slightly grainy in areas, it is certainly much better than many DVD compilations out there (example - the Sanford and Son series has awful video quality)and the sound is quite good.  I have not encountered any of the video break-up some people complained about and only a slight hesitation on layer switching from one disc.  This may be dependant on the quality of your DVD player, as many low end machines do hesitate on layer switching, no matter what the DVD quality.  As stated in many reviews, the initial season was filmed on low quality film and the video should pick up mid-way through the second season when the film production switched to higher values.
  All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and eagerly look forward to season 2 in September.",1052352000,2,1011,4.775862068965517

If you're new to the whole Xena thing, then this is a great place to start and it's priced reasonably. Great bonus materials too (although I was very disappointed that there were no closed captions). I don't think I've ever known of a show that captured the attention of so many different types of people. I mean, when I was at a Herc/Xena convention I sat next to a Hell's Angel...how cool is that?

1836710,5,B00008DDWV,"Too sum it up in so many words. It took forever to put this set of DVDs out. I have been a huge fan of Xena since the show began. But the drawbacks on the dvds are,the episodes are grainy and dark. But the added bonus,5.1 surround sound on every episode. Some boxsets don't give yoou that. If you were to buy this,you cant go wrong. Just cant wait for Season 2.  TROY",1052179200,,367,4.027397260273973

Comes in a folding 7-part sleeve so there are no individial DVD cases in the set - just one long foldout. Current sets are issued with a silver season one collectible coin with a mailer that's included for a free coin holder (you pay $... P/H). Nice pictures on the foldout sleeves - packaging is very nice. DVD 1 contains a still gallery although I haven't yet checked the others in the set.
I have to question the video quality on this set - it appears to be a bit grainy and it most noticable during very dark/black scenes. I have never noticed this with other DVD's played on my Toshiba DVD player, though you may want to consult with other owners regarding picture quality (DVD player and TV type does make a difference). I tried it on two DVD players and two TV sets and the picture quality is simply grainy, more so than the season 5 video set I own.
  Sound quality is acceptible although disc 1 sounds a bit ""dull"" so far. Digital surround sound (not the ""fake"" 3D surround sound) mode seems to sound the crispest. There is no 5.1, no DTS 5.1, so the standard 2.0 Dolby Digital is offered as with all region 1 DVD's. (My home theatre system is new to me so I only hope that I have read the information correctly from my system display.)
  Still, this beats rewinding/forwarding through VHS tapes. For the price it's worth the format alone. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars to this set... Enjoy Xena!

1836712,3,B00008DDWV,"When I learned that Xena was finally being issued on DVD, I was very excited. When I saw the specs on it, I couldn't wait. I am also a big fan of Xena, and have been since the first year. The show was beautifully done. Humor and life flows through this show, and I never fail to be entertained by the episodes.
I rely on closed captioning to ""hear"" what goes on screen. Since Xena was captioned, I assumed that it would be subtitled or at least subtitled. Imagine my BIG DISAPPOINTMENT when I got home with it to find out its not.
Shame on Anchor Bay Entertainment for being too cheap to ""do it right"" and fail to caption Xena. I returned my copy of Xena and will take great pains never to buy another ABE title. I am also writing them to express my displeasure. This is not the first title they have messed up.
This effort gets 3 stars, because the material is so good... but the release of it just [flops]- this was a promising effort that really didn't measure up. My advice is not to buy it until ABE fixes their blunder.",1052006400,4,1025,4.208121827411167
1836713,5,B00008DDWV,"I agree with what the hearing impaired customers said about the lack of CC on Xena DVDs. I have also been waiting ages for the DVD of XWP with subtitles/CC.
I am very angry that they haven't managed to put subtitles in these DVDs, where my DVD player can play any region DVDs with or without CC. It's not fair at all!
Even the depressing news that in the UK (my country) we do have Xena VHS videos, but not CC and is still very angry about it, where I had to tape all my episodes from satellite TV with CC on them, apart from one episode - The Way is missing from my CC Xena:WP episode lists. GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!
We should start a campaign to persuade the manufacturers to subtitle Xena DVDs for die-hard Xenites who are deaf/hard of hearing, especially for those who live in another country like Europe, Japan, Australia etc.
Looks like I won't buy them until they are CC/subtitled. Damn.",1052006400,,885,4.402439024390244
1836754,4,B00008DDWV,"I am a huge fan of Xena and was very disappointed that this DVD series haven't been encoded with Closed Captioning nor offered English subtitles. The majority of new media releases contain these features and the television even aired it with Closed Captioning as well as the finale DVD, so why would they exclude that in the season series? The pictures are great, but since I'm hard of hearing I need the story line to go with the pictures in order to fully experience Xena/Gabrielle, their adventures and spiritual growth. I will be holding off from buying any future Xena Season DVDs until someone produces them with CC or Subtitle features.",1051833600,2,643,4.801801801801802
1836755,3,B00008DDWV,"Each episode of Xena: Warrior Princess is presented in its original 4:3 broadcast aspect ratio, and the source material is shockingly grainy. Every once in a while (mostly during bright outdoor shots) the film grain rears its ugly head in a major way. Maybe it's an aesthetic decision, or just poor film stock, but regardless its annoying. Aside from the grain, the source material is in good shape with little real defects or other anomalies. Colors are fairly well-saturated if not particularly impressive, but black levels fluctuate too much for a show that is still relatively recent, with indoor scenes looking good but much of the outdoor sequences suffering from a washed-out look. Detail is thus only is fair and shadow delineation wanting. There are no examples of compression artifacting to speak of, but this is still not a set of transfers worthy of a warrior princess. The show is great but the video on this dvd that was remastered by Anchor bay is why I gave this set 3 stars",1051833600,2,990,4.795321637426901
1836756,4,B00008DDWV,At long last Xena is finally on DVD in a box set here in the U.S.! I for one have been waiting for this dvd set for years. Europe have had them out for a long while and I believe are already on season 5 boxed sets (although I've heard the episodes on season one are out of order in Europe).  I finally was able to find a copy two days after it came out and was very anxious to get home and watch it.  I think over all it's a good set but I was suprised by the picture quality.  I have read on here that the picture is great and has been remastered but on mine the picture is very grainy looking.  I was let down by this since shows like Farscape and Doctor Who look so great on dvd.  Xena didn't look much better than my Star Trek the Next Generation set.  Other than that I don't have any complaints at all and will still buy all the other seasons of Xena and Hercules when they come out.,1051833600,4,889,3.883977900552486

The sound and video are great when I watch the episodes through my regular television set, putting the disc in my DVD player.
But I'm a big fan of watching DVDs on my laptop. It has a high definition plasma screen, and I guess I've just been spoiled by the Fellowship of the Ring. But the Xena DVDs end up looking distractingly pixelated when I watch them on my laptop.
But that's the only drawback I've found. It's been two years since Xena went off the air, and each season just gets better. So lets get the rest of these Xena seasons out on DVD!",1051660800,,699,4.109489051094891

Why would they not Caption the DVD version when they Captioned the VHS version.  I've been waiting for the DVD forever and unfortunately it's not captioned.  I noticed that the first Season of Hercules coming out in June will be Captioned.

Well worth the wait, but it could be a while before you have the complete set!  Do US viewers not have multi-region players?  If so, you can get every episode on DVD right now.",1047772800,3,356,3.7333333333333334
1836760,5,B00008DDWV,"The 1st Season of Xena was addictive, mindblowing and, like all beginnings, had some kinks to be worked out. The casting of Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor was phenomenal from day one; Lawless (as most of you probably know) plays a profound, regretful, blue eyed, powerful former warlord who, thanks to help from Hercules, sets out to thoughtfully atone for her past reign of terror.
""Nothing you can do can erase the shame you've brought onto your kinsmen,"" Xena's mother exclaims with sorrow. ""Probably not,"" Xena admits sadly, eyes dropping, ""but I'm going to spend the right of my life trying."" And does she ever! In one of her first attempts at being ""good"", the warrior princess lays eyes on Gabrielle, a spirited and selfless village girl who, after seeing Xena's heroics, wants to ""join up with"" up her and ""wants to be a warrior like her."" As all fans know, Gabrielle is instrumental in reforming Xena by sharing her unconditional love & showing her how much good there is to be done. Xena, in return, has a renewed purpose & reason to live while gladly ready to die for Gabrielle. Like most 1st seasons, the characters are a little shaky, the acting is new & unsual, & the plots are somewhat undefined & experimental & therefore not as soul pinching, action packed and heartpounding as the seasons that so bravely followed. Also, while X & G's relationship grew dramatically over the years, it was only ""friendly"" at this stage of the game. At least they wised up a tiny bit in the 2nd season.
Still, it holds a special place in the hearts of all Xena fans as the noble beginning of a timeless legend of pursuing the things that matter: love, sacrifice, the greater good, nobility, triumpth, loss, life.
There are 24 great episodes but HIGHLIGHTS include:
""Sins Of The Past"" -pilot episode
Xena journeys homeward determined to atone for the sins of her past, but her efforts to begin a new life are challenged by the vengeful warlord Draco. A betrothed village girl, Gabrielle, takes to the warrior princess immediately.
""Dreamworker""
Xena must enter the magical realm of the Dreamscape to rescue Gabrielle after she is kidnapped by an unlikely god.
""Altared States""
Xena & Gab intervene to save young boy from being sacrificed to a ""one God"" by his own father
""The Greater Good""
When Xena is hit with a poisoned dart, Gab must disguise herself as the warrior princess in a plan to save Salmoneous and a town from an evil warlord
""Callisto""
Xena must battle the fierce woman warrior Callisto, who is bent on revenge for the burning death of her family by evil Xena years ago. One of my top ten faves of all times...
""Is There A Doctor In The House?""
Xena attempts to end the Mitoan-Thessalian War while trying to use her medical knowledge to save the lives of numerous casualties, including the critically wounded Gabrielle",1046822400,11,2833,4.725252525252525
1836761,5,B00008DDWV,"Well here we are with the first season of ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" coming to DVD via Anchor Bay instead of through the official Davis-Panzer site.  This is a good thing.  Because from reviews I've read of the Davis-Panzer versions, the video and audio quality is abysmal on them.  Davis-Panzer also produced the Highlander Series as well and of course released some of those seasons on DVD (and VHS) through their site as well with equally dismal video/audio.
Well rest easy folks.  Anchor Bay is fast becoming one of the best DVD Production companies out there.  I have recently purchased two Anchor Bay DVD sets and they are suppurb, both in packaging and in presentation.  One being the newly remastered ""The Complete Musketeers"" and Davis-Panzer's ""Highlander - The Series: Season One""  Both products are excellent.  ""The Complete Musketeers"" was finally given the treatment it deserved with all new correct anamorphic transfers and new documentaries.  ""Highlander - The Series"" DVD set was also great.  The newly remixed 5.1 surround is very strong and has wide soundstage.  The music envelopes you with the surround speakers and the main action is very strong in the front channels.  Picture quality is about good as you would expect from a early-'90s TV show.  It is a good clean transfer most of the time with a small amount of grain in the the darker scenes, but those shots usually don't last long.  I fully intend to buy the subsequent seasons with Season 2 coming in July.
But here we are with the start of the Xena and Hercules sets from Anchor Bay.  Xena coming in late-April, and Hercules coming in mid-June.  From seeing the quality of the Highlander set, I have no doubt that Anchor Bay will give Xena and Hercules the royal treatment they deserve.  The sound should be awesome and the video should be probably better than the Highlander set being slightly newer series.
I must admit that I was never a faithful fan to any of these Davis-Panzer shows, but from the episodes I did see of them, I always thought that they had excellent production values with good writing and character development.  So I'm excited to begin collecting the Davis-Panzer shows.  Besides, they fit my genre interests.
So fear not Xena/Hercules fans, these sets should be very good.  Anchor Bay is great.  Should have some interesting extra features as well.",1046649600,,2352,4.8740554156171285
