8259064,1,B0015LPS2I,"I bought this movie thinking it would be a delightful reunion of some of the Soprano's cast.  Ummm...no.  The only one on screen for an even portion of the movie is Johnny Saks.  The rest are just sitting around a table telling a story and aren't involved that much.
Now for the movie.  It was stupid & NOT the slight bit funny.  I'm kicking myself for buying this even though it was $2.99.  Save an hour & a half of your life - don't bother!!",1362614400,,443,4.152941176470589
8259065,4,B0015LPS2I,"Just listening to the songs, you've got to know this isn't ""The Godfather."" It's good for some laughs as long as you don't take it seriously. The acting is OK, but as with most of Larry Blamire's movies, it's the writing that really stands out.
This was a popular film festival entry and, while it might not win many awards, it has won a legion of fans.",1282694400,,353,4.2835820895522385
8259066,3,B0015LPS2I,"I was kind of tempted to give this four stars, but I think it just misses the mark. Don't get me wrong; this is a solid comedy with a great premise. It's just that the execution falls a tad short of really good, but still is enjoyable and entertaining.

A lounge singer desperate for success somehow hooks up with a mob boss in hiding who's just opened a new nightclub/lounge and who wants the singer (Johnny Slade) to be his main act. The reason? Slade has to sing songs with coded messages written by the mob boss for select audience members (the mob boss' soldiers) to go out and deliver hits to specific individuals. Very clever. The mob boss writes the lyrics; Johnny writes the music.

There's a framing device, which also works well, of a bunch of mob soldiers sitting around a restaurant table debating who the best singer is. Of course Sinatra comes in numero uno, but there's a lot of debate about number 2, and that's where the story of Johnny Slade kicks in.

There's some truly funny stuff here and it's great to see so many actors from the hit cable TV show The Sopranos in attendance here. This is a fun movie, definitely worth watching. I would definitely give it three and a half stars. It's not stupid at all; it's neato.",1226102400,6,1239,4.4493392070484585
8259067,4,B0015LPS2I,"Originally entitled ""Johnny Slade's Greatest Hits"" (I think a better and less generic title) this comedy is a blast to watch.
John Fiore (Law and Order, The Sopranos), as Johnny Slade, plays a comedic role very well, especially in scenes with Vincent Curatola as Mr. Samantha, the mafia boss in hiding. Samantha's only recourse for getting orders out for mob hits are through his strange lyrics for songs voiced by Slade, hired just for this purpose. Of course, Slade knows nothing of the real reason behind his sudden success and hefty paycheck. He just thinks he's finally hit it big after a long series of unsuccessful ventures into other genres of music. (Amusingly and efficiently portrayed by a series of hilarious album covers shown in the opening titles.)

The story is told via the reminiscences of a dinner table full of what we presume to be wiseguys, portrayed by a host of actors from ""The Sopranos.""

Director/writer Larry Blamire's talent for unique and playful dialogue, skewed characters and unimpeded pacing makes for a fun time. This film is especially interesting to watch when contrasted with or added to Blamire's previous works. (""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" ""Trail of the Screaming Forehead"") At present, only ""Meet the Mobsters"" and ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" are available to the public but his other films now in post-production (""Dark and Stormy Night"", ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"") will hopefully be released in a timely manner. Keep an eye out for these at various film festivals.

If you're a Blamire fan, a Fiore fan, or a Sopranos fan this is a worthwhile addition to your DVD library",1215907200,8,1629,4.95970695970696
8259068,4,B0015LPS2I,I recently purchased this movie and I thought it was hilarious! I found it entertaining and enjoyable. If you want to curl up with a fun comedy and be entertained by the guys from the Sopranos... then I definitely recommend it.,1213142400,3,227,4.560975609756097
