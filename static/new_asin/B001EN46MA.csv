8298939,2,B001EN46MA,"BIKINI BLOODBATH CARWASH is a title that lets you know immediately what you're in for. I mean, how could anyone possibly be expecting high art? That said, I must admit that I was expecting far less male break-dancing or shirtless fat men putting on lipstick! Alas, there are far better bikini car washes exhibited on YOUTUBE. Still, the girls are blazing hot, funny, and are all stage-trained actresses. Well, ok, I lied about that last bit. Let's face it, this is just an excuse to show naked women running around. How about that crrrazeee chef guy though? Wow, he's an abomination! There is gore, but none that makes any real impression, unless you long to see male nipples sawn off. Debbie Rochon plays a pretty good ""drill-sergeant"" role as the girls' boss. Anyway, BBC has too little skin to be soft core, and too little story to be an actual movie...",1365120000,,856,4.675496688741722
8298940,1,B001EN46MA,"Sigh. I think me and my group of friends could have done a better job at acting then this. It seemed like some of the actors (and I use that term loosely) weren't at all interested in being in this film. They were as they say in basketball ""going through the motion""

Natalie Laspina is beautiful, but this ilm was ugly. The killer was lame, the special effects are what you would expect from a lower than low budget film. The random dancing at the carwash with the guys was embarrassing and utterly pointless. I found myself throughout the movie saying ""Instead of this, I would have done this.."" Basically changing the movie and when I become the writer and editor as a viewer thats when a movie is bad.

I ask myself why would anyone want to be in a film like this? Maybe it looks better on paper, but the acting, special effects just ruined it, with time and some....ok alot of alterations this film could have been a decent B movie.",1300752000,2,937,4.379310344827586
8298941,1,B001EN46MA,There was not a single person in this crappy film that resembled any asspect of an actor the killer was so lame it was just a bad movie,1278720000,3,135,3.857142857142857
8298942,5,B001EN46MA,"Bikini Bloodbath Carwash is the sequel to 2007's slasher-comedy Bikini Bloodbath. While I liked that movie, I thought there was room for improvement. The humor was there, but it just wasn't consistent. Also, there wasn't near enough of Debbie Rochon, my favorite actress. However, in this sequel, the makers of the movie pull out the stops and deliver a near b-movie masterpiece.

'Carwash' is non-stop funny. From beginning to end, I was laughing. It definately ranks up there with The Janitor and Blood Feast 2 as being one of the funniest slasher-comedies I've seen. Oh, and Debbie Rochon doesn't have a glorified cameo in this one like in the first Bikini Bloodbath. She's the star. And she has the funniest lines. Her dialogue is profane and politically incorrect. She plays a lesbian who lusts after all the hot babes in this movie.

As you can probably tell, I love Bikini Bloodbath Carwash and am looking forward to Bikini Bloodbath Christmas, which I hope will pay homage to movies like Black Christmas and Silent Night, Deadly Night, only with a lot of laughs.",1250899200,10,1070,4.873626373626373
8298943,3,B001EN46MA,"First off do not go into this movie thinking its gonna be a film to discuss at you local coffee shop when you and your peers meet up for some lattes.  Secondly take this movie for what it is...Low Budget, Low Brow, Half Naked Women, and mass amounts of poorly made fake blood.  Now Invite your friends over...no not the film snob ones or the ones that wear The Nightmare Before Christmas Hoodies that love Donnie Darko... The ones that think chugging beer is a good way to spend an evening with friends.

In my opinion this movie succeeds where all those damn scary movie,epic movies etc fail.  This never takes itself serious, doesnt try to be something its not, and feels like a movie made by fans for fans.

The movie is made up of the Chef from the original Zombified and out for revenge after he is awoken.  throw in about 40 minutes of lowest of low budget death scenes, penis references galore, and jokes straight out of a junor high cafeteria and add in a rushed ending and you have this movie in a nutshell.  add in a 7 minute blooper reel and a 3 cast interviews and you have the special feature list.

The Highlight for this movie was the terrible acting...damn near every scene the actors were trying thier best to keep a straight face which shows they had fun making this nonsense.  So if this type of stuff entertains you as much as it did me do yourself a favor and check it out.  If not im sure theres some high budget remake out there for the rest of yall.",1242259200,4,1473,4.304347826086956
