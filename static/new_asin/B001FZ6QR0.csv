8303125,5,B001FZ6QR0,"Presented here are two British TV. Films from the early career of Daniel Craig.

""The Trench"" is a riveting and claustrophobic tale of life and death in the trenches of World War I. And again Mr. Daniel Craig brings something wonderful to the table as a hardened Sergeant who knows that he must keep his boys busy to keep them sane. It is a pleasure to watch him particularly in the ""Jam"" scene. The range of emotion he shows at the beginning of the scene when the boys can't see him as he eats from a jar of homemade jam sent by his wife is stunning and real, near tears he shoves the jam in his mouth as if to stuff down his impossible sorrow. Watch as this brilliant actor moves on to offer some jam to his superior officer. This is brilliant work by an actor who even in 1999 and early on in his career had a grasp of what it is to be a multi faceted human being and the talent to project that onto the screen. Daniel Craig is one of the best there is in world cinema.

The film is well worth seeing for these reasons and many more. At times very graphic and violent and still deeply touching and sad beyond the deepest wounds of war and the human heart.

With the second film here in this package we get a real treat in the form of ""Kiss And Tell"". To be honest I was not expecting much from the description of the film. Boy was I wrong. Here is a tightly wound mystery that kept me on the edge of my couch trying desperately not to reach for the remote to fast-forward out of the more chilling scenes. The suspense was that compelling. Mr. Craig shines in the role of a cop who is still in love with his colleague played by Rosie Rowell. (Miss Rowell also gives a compelling tight performance here.) He and the entire cast just give so much spark and excitement to this cat and mouse tale of murder in suburban England. I really was engrossed by this film, a wonderful surprise and a great addition to anyone's library that might be a fan of great acting, good stories, or Mr. Craig.

  Both Films are Must See in my book.",1258502400,6,2028,4.173913043478261
