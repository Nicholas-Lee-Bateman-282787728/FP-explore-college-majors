2906855,5,B000TLTCO0,"The Restless Gun only aired for two seasons (1957-1959), and was caught up in the glut of Western television programming that occurred in the 1950s. But it is wonderful news that Timeless Media has released episodes of this series on DVD because this is another example of a great show that has not received its due.

The series starred and was co-produced by John Payne, who was transitioning his career from motion pictures to television after a long film career capped by his performance as the defense attorney in the classic Christmas film, ""Miracle On 34th Street."" Payne played Vint Bonner, a former gunfighter who has retired from the trade and wanders the West. Bonner is more reticent than most heroes to use his gun, and has sensitivity and compassion that is expected from Western heroes, but more fully realized here than in most Westerns.

The series had all the hallmarks of great television - great lead character, great performances, great writing, and great casting. David Dortort, who would go on to produce Bonanza, worked with Payne to include the best supporting actors in The Restless Gun. Perennial Western actors like Jack Elam, Denver Pyle, James Coburn, Claude Akins, Royal Dano, plus some of the actors that would appear on Bonanza, including Dan Blocker,  Michael Landon, and Ray Teal.

Payne's Vint Bonner is a thoughtful, decent fellow who is easy to root for, and The Restless Gun merits this DVD release, and a full series release sometime in the near future.",1199059200,35,1492,4.932270916334661
2906856,5,B000TLTCO0,"I was much too young to remember this program because it aired from 1957 to 1959. However, just because I don't remember it certainly doesn't mean that I don't enjoy this type of television - and much better than some of the junk aired today!. The 3 disc DVD set features 24 out of the 78 aired episodes. It stars handsome John Payne as the amiable Vint Bonner, former Civil War soldier and hired gunslinger who wanders from town to town in the old west. It is fast paced with good writing, making this program one of the more enjoyable series of it's time. Some of the film quality isn't up to today's standards but considering the film stock is 50 years old, it's kind of to be expected. I can't imagine that anyone in 1957 would have thought that people of 2007 would be watching this so naturally, the film stock isn't as well preserved as, say, a major motion picture. Thanks for making this available and please consider releasing the other 54 episodes.",1197331200,30,959,4.485714285714286
2906857,5,B000TLTCO0,"I'm surprised and quite pleased that this often forgotten 1957-59 western has found it's way to a DVD release by Timeless Media Group.  Rugged John Payne stars as Vint Bonner in the ""Restless Gun.""  Bonner travels the southwest trying to live down his reputation as one of the fastest guns in the post-Civil War era.  Bonner tries to avoid trouble, but it most often finds him.  The set starts out with the 30-minute pilot episode first aired on ""Schlitz Playhouse of Stars.""  Payne is surrounded by one terrific set of supporting players in the pilot -- William Hopper (""Perry Mason""), Michael Landon (""Bonanza""), and Andrew Duggan (""Lancer"").  Many TV western icons guest star in the remaining 23-episode set, including Morgan Woodward (""Wyatt Earp""), Dan Blocker (""Bonanza""), Claude Akins, Jack Elam (""The Dakotas""), Ben Johnson, Robert Fuller (""Laramie""), James Coburn, Royal Dano, Edgar Buchanan, and Denver Pyle.  The prints drawn from the Universal/NBC archives are not pristine (some streaks, very dark evening shots, specks) but quite watchable.  As someone who has collected 16mm prints of numerous westerns over the years, I would grade the overall picture in the set an 8, on a 1-10 scale; the audio is first-rate.  Snap this set up along with other TMG/NBC releases of ""The Tall Man"" (Clu Gulager, Barry Sullivan), ""Laredo"" (Neville Brand), ""Riverboat"" (Burt Reynolds) and ""Cimarron City"" (George Montgomery).

2906878,5,B000TLTCO0,For some reason i failed to watch this series in my youth but after my brother said it was his favourite tv western and was a great fan of John Payne i decided to buy it. I am glad that i did as i thought it was up there with some of my favourites. I'm sure anyone who is into the old westerns will really enjoy the series. Highly recommended.,1351555200,,343,3.914285714285714
2906879,5,B000TLTCO0,"This show was what had what could be called a ""Cult"" following when I was in College.  I believe that this show came on Television at either 11:30 or Noon and the television room in the dorm was packed with people watching this show every day.  This show and ""The Untouchables"" were the most watched television shows while in college.  Glad to have some of the shows to watch again.",1344988800,,382,4.428571428571429

We have until now completed the first disc and part way through the second, we have enjoyed each episode so far with very good storyline, acting with John Payne playing his role so well, and no doubt the quality of the picture and sound, no surprise there as this is what we receive each time with Amazon and Timeless Media Group. For those that like Westerns this is a good quality product.",1344297600,,464,4.470588235294118

2906882,5,B000TLTCO0,"I am still watching the episodes of Restless Gun, but so far, so good. John Payne was an underrated actor. He's no John Wayne, but maybe he didn't want to be. And to me, being unique is always refreshing and good.",1297209600,,213,4.219512195121951
2906883,4,B000TLTCO0,"I PURCHASED THIS 2 DVD SET AS I LIKE JOHN PAYNE AS AN AN ACTOR HE WAS GOOD IN MUSICALS BUT A LOT BETTER IN WESTERNS AND DRAMAS, IT IS VERY GOOD  AND THE PRINTS ARE GOOD  AND THEY RUN FOR 25 MINS EACH ,BUT I WOULD RATHER THEM MADE IT ALL INTO ONE MOVIE, THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD  AND IN B/W BUT FOR JOHN PAYNE THEY WAS NOT  ALL THAT GOOD IN WAY OF ACTING AND STORIES , AS THEY WAS A LITTLE SLOW  WITH THEM  BUT FOR THE PRICE THEY ARE A GOOD SET AND A GOOD BUY FOR THE PRICE, MOST OF ALL FOR SUCH A GOOD ACTOR HE WAS. THEY ARE WORTH BUYING IF YOU LIKE JOHN PAYNE AND WESTERNS .
TO ME JOHN PAYNE WAS A REALLY GOOD STAR AT THE TIME  AND ALWAYS WORTH HAVING TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN .  FAR BETTER THAN WHAT WE WILL EVER SEE TODAY . BUT I DO GIVE THIS SET 4 STAR ,  THERE ARE NO EXRAS IN THIS SET , BUT THEY ARE IN A NICE EMBOSSED TIN TO MAKE UP FOR IT . THERE IS NOT THE ACTION AS EXPECTED IN THIS SET  AND DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ITS TITLE, RESTLESS GUN",1293321600,,947,3.466666666666667
2906884,5,B000TLTCO0,"I am very happy to possess 24 episodes of ""The Restless Gun"", John Payne gives a very relaxed performance -
and I say that in a positive sense.
Although lacking any extras on this 3 DVD set, I am used to that now. I do not recall this series from my youth,
perhaps it did not reach the west coast of Australia, but I am enjoying it now,
The Restless Gun has no problem displaying blood following a shooting, I do not recall seeing that in other
programs of the period, it helps to show there are consequences in being shot, in one episode John Payne uses
a graze by a bullet from his gun as a form of shock treatment.
Having witnessed shock treatment 20 century style in operating theatres I prefer John Paynes method.
Entertaining, please release more of the 77 episodes.",1289692800,2,772,4.368055555555555

2906886,5,B000TLTCO0,"All of the review thus far pretty well describe the episodes; the quality and quantity of this show. I agree with most, it was an excellent western TV series, and I too hope TMG releases the entire series. One thing needs to be mentioned that I have yet to see in any reviews. The excellent quality of Timeless Media Groups' packaging. Too bad CBS did not take the time to do such a good job with Have Gun Will Travel Season 4, as TMG did with this set. Timeless Media Group put these episodes in a really nice box set, with each disc having its own box, just like they did with the Branded series. It may not matter to some, but CBS, charges an arm and a leg for its show and then puts them in a crummy plastic sleeve that will break eventually.  They need to take notice of the quality of TMGs' sets. These sets look nice, and protect the disc much better. Now let's just hope for the rest of this show!
A little late, but at last TMG released the entire series....I will buy it w/out reading a single review....I know it has to be good!",1280534400,2,1039,4.169154228855722
2906887,5,B000TLTCO0,"John Payne plays the reformed gunslinger Vint Bonner in the Restless Gun series.  Reformed...,almost.  For a man who has given up gun-fighting he sure gets himself into a lot of them. Not that he goes looking for trouble, but it seems to find him, and follow him around along with his reputation for having a very fast gun.

Each episode opens with a brief image of Bonner riding his horse Scar and smiling as a voice over introduces him, then the Episode begins. But Vint Bonner does not do a lot of smiling in this series.  Though he's what you might call a ruggedly handsome man He has a rather perpetually sad look to his eyes and face, as if he'd spent a lot of time with a lot of burdens on his mind. He has no family , so he put a name to his horse, Scar, and when people ask him..., he says that his horse is his next-of-kin.

 Bonner travels from town to town doing various jobs, typically as a ranch hand or a herdsman or other typical cowboy work. His reputation is wide spread, so most people pause when they hear his name , wondering if he's dangerous and treat him with suspicion. A lot of town sheriffs seem to know him, this seems to be due to his having ridden with a number of posse's and helping them capture dangerous outlaws. The stories are mixed. For example, in one episode called Cheyenne Express he finds himself acting as a reluctant friend to a nervous shabby sad-faced two-bit outlaw who shot his gang leader in the back. Thinking he would be seen as a hero now, this meek little outlaw instead finds himself the target of everyone's hatered and revile for shooting a man in the back. Bonner reluctantly protects the outlaw from bullies and others who wouldn't mind seeing him share his gang leader's fate. It's an uncomfortable episode that deals with a fine line between being an outlaw and being accepted in a community. It ends tragically, as it probably should, but it leaves a lot of questions in mind.  It's unusual to see such a thought provoking episode in a typical western series, but many of the episodes of The Restless Gun are like that. I recommend it.  I found John Payne to be a very engaging actor and the supporting actors and actresses give powerful performances.

 There are some light hearted episodes too. For example, in one episode Bonner has to meet with a local Indian tribe to try to get them to give up some renegade braves who committed crimes, at that time we see a young beautiful Indian girl ,possibly in her teenage years, gazing at him. She secretly falls in love with Bonner and unknown to him, follows him home. And from that point onward the episode is a hilarious series of attempts by Bonner to gently but firmly shake her loose and get her to go home.  Little does he know that this is the Chief's daughter and he soon finds himself enmeshed in some Indian traditions he'd rather avoid.  Definitely worth viewing, you should buy this compilation of episodes, I think you will greatly enjoy it. The quality of the video was good, but not great.  It was clear enough and sharp enough to view comfortably and the audio was good, though at one or two spots it became slightly muddled, it was very brief and 99% of the video and audio had no problem.

 I just watched the dvd with only 8 episodes and loved everyone! This show was brillantly written and should of been in the top of the class! With all the other reviews that have been posted since 2007, one thing is for sure... WE LOVE THIS PROGRAM! Now do it justice and release all 77 episodes and remastered!

2906899,5,B000TLTCO0,"I've been hard on Timeless Media for Laramie and M Squad. But in the whole, I'm glad they are out there releasing these old westerns. If you own one set, this is the best of the bunch with Wells Fargo a close second. This has great prints and better than the usual western stories. Probably one of the first westerns to bridge the gap from children's (Lone Ranger) to Adult (Have Gun, Will Travel). But you have to be on guard for every set coming out. Is it going to be great or trash? How about this Timeless?  Premier Series (Great prints) and Classic Series (fair to poor sourced prints).",1247097600,4,592,4.381818181818182

It has the same episodes as the first DVD of the 3 DVD box set. If you already own the box set, don't bother to buy this. If you would like just to own one volume, then go for it. It won't disappoint. Amazon refunded my money when I returned it - I just wish that they had listed the episodes to begin with. This series had an original 78 episode run - there are about 45 episodes that are not available on DVD.",1242691200,10,533,4.028301886792453
2906901,4,B000TLTCO0,"I was thrilled that Timeless Media video released more 8 episodes of the Restless Gun HOWEVER, who ever chose the episodes thought it was a good idea to include 2 that were already released in the 2007 twenty four episode box set - how stupid is that? One would think that, out of the original 78 episodes of this series (with 54 OTHER unreleased episodes to choose from), that there would be 8 DIFFERENT episodes in this set --- but NOOOOOOO. The 2 that are the reruns are: The Outlander and The Way Back. The NEW episodes are: Ride with the Devil, Lady by Law, The New Sheriff, The Whip, Dragon for a Day and Tomboy.
Still worth the price and it's in a nice tin box.",1236988800,13,668,4.267716535433071
2906902,4,B000TLTCO0,"I almost passed on this item thinking it was a re-release of some of the episodes put out by Timeless on their box set in November 2007.

For those unaware, Timeless have a licence to issue some older NBC material which the parent company would not consider releasing. The deal does not cover prints which Timeless have to source for themselves, usually 16mm. Do not,therefore,expect the crystal clear quality & restoration evident on similar releases from the larger studios.

As mentioned a box set of 24 episodes appeared in late 2007. It seems six more prints have now been obtained & they all appear here,together with two episodes from the previous set.

'The Restless Gun' stars John Payne as Vint Bonner,a slightly weary & wandering ex-gunfighter. His reputation often precedes him & he has to reluctantly call on his old gunfighter skills from time to time. Payne is excellent in the lead & fans of the genre should be entertained.

Unusually this set comes in a tin with an embossed picture on the lid. Inside are two standard Amray cases with the eight episodes.

Picture quality is perfectly watchable and on a par with the previous release. If you have that set you will know what to expect, if not this makes an interesting introduction to the series.",1236297600,12,1265,4.784403669724771
2906903,5,B000TLTCO0,"Terrific acting and strong, intelligent scripts. ""Restless Gun"" fans should get ""Tall Man.""

2906904,5,B000TLTCO0,"I recently purchased an eight episode DVD of the Restless Gun and will buy the 20+ episode package from Amazon.

I am in my early 50's and fondly remember many of the classic shows of the fifties and sixties, and one of them is The Restless Gun. John Payne was ideally cast as Vint Bonner in a show that makes many of today's
programs pale in comparison.

It is great to see that so many of the classic television programs
of the past, comedy, drama and western are being released on DVD for not only current but future generations to enjoy.

If you tire of the news, politics and much of the fare on the tube
these days, pop in a few episodes of The Restless Gun starring John
Payne in your DVD player, you will not be disappointed.",1226016000,3,733,4.258992805755396
2906905,5,B000TLTCO0,"Timeless Media Group presents ""THE RESTLESS GUN"" (1957-1958) (600 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --  The Six Shooter was a 1953-54 radio series created by Frank Burt in which legendary actor James Stewart played the role of the cowboy traveler Britt Ponset --- James Stewart's Britt Ponset was a man with a reputation for having a fast gun but nonetheless a thinking man who didn't reach for his gun first and ask questions later.

 The Six Shooter was to become The Restless Gun on television in 1957-58 --- Action film star, John Payne took over from James Stewart, taking the name Britt Ponset with him into three appearances on TV's Schlitz Playhouse of Stars before moving onto a regular TV series, entitled The Restless Gun and with a name changed to Vint Bonner --- Just like Stewart, Payne ""narrated"" proceedings in a series of stories which were often adapted from episodes aired on radio.

John Payne also produced the TV series (along with David Dortort, who would go on to produce Bonanza) which ran for two seasons and 77 episodes - these were very polished, well budgeted 30 minute B&W western adventures which also featured an interesting array of guest stars: Ben Johnson, James Coburn, J. Carrol Naish, Edgar Buchanan, Jack Elam, William Hopper, Andrew Duggan plus eventual regulars on Bonanza: Dan Blocker & Michael Landon.

Payne was a thoroughgoing professional in every kind of film be it musical or dramatic --- That was much in evidence in The Restless Gun --- It ran on NBC opposite another western show with an actor looking to make the transition to television --- That would be Rory Calhoun in The Texan.

2906906,4,B000TLTCO0,I am half way through the series and I am amazed at the quality of acting and the stories presented for viewing. My only complaint is that on occasions the quality of the picture is reduced slightly obviously from the transfer to DVD and the age of the series. But still a great watch and I highly recommend it for viewing by all ages.,1207008000,7,335,4.25
2906907,5,B000TLTCO0,"The 77 half-hour episodes (all in B&W) of the television western ""The Restless Gun"" ran from 1957-1959 on NBC.  John Payne (best known as the Santa believing attorney in ""Miracle on 34th Street"") played the title character whose series name was Vint Bonner.  There was also a half hour pilot where Payne's character had a different name (Britt Ponset).  23 of these episodes (including the pilot) are on the new DVD release.

""The Restless Gun"" was a big deal back in those days.  It had its own Dell 4-color comic book and was part of Topps 1958 set of T.V. Western trading cards.  This was the first series for ""Bonanza"" producer David Dotort.  Payne was the show's executive producer.

What distinguished Vint Bonner from the legion of televised loners (Johnny Yuma, Cheyenne, Sugarfoot, Bronco Lane, etc.) who were roaming the range back then was that he was clearly a professional gunfighter (like Paladin) and not just somebody trying to find themselves.  He didn't have Paladin's style or fondness for the good life, rather he seemed pretty world weary and disillusioned.

Bonner carried around a special kit that would extend the effective range of his colt.  This involved a detailed assembly sequence in which a barrel extension and a rifle stock were attached to the handgun.  The idea of a modified novelty gun soon inspired imitators, ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""The Rifleman"" in the western genre.  But it was the U.N.C.L.E. gun a few years later that was the most like what was featured on ""The Restless Gun"".  The original has been largely forgotten except among toy collectors as a replica was released along with the show's other merchandising programs.
