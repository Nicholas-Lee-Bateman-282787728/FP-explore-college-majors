8472571,3,B005H0OEN2,"I bought this for where it was shot [War Eagle/Eureka Springs, AR area]. The scenery was great.
It has an amazing cast for an obscure low budget film & the acting is wonderful.
I can even say that the language out of one boy's mouth was meant to add realism--teen boys talk worse around their friends. [*don't let small kids hear this stuff]
But when the story finally dragged me through the first hour, I thought I would get to see some 'payoff'. Instead, it ends and you get to read on the empty screen what happened to everyone.
I may keep it for the location shots, or I may re-sell it . . . But I won't watch it again for any entertainment value.",1367625600,,651,4.216
8472572,5,B005H0OEN2,"This movie is absolutely incredible! Luke Grimes and Daniel Mcabe performed wonderfully in this film. The film presents a prime example of friendship. Like ""Wheels"" I also have cerebral palsy. Samuel was my favorite character he was a people person. Enoch was great as well a must see film!!!",1354924800,2,292,4.979591836734694
