He already has great storytelling ability and can show so much in characters-even when they are just showing emotions and not speaking them.  I was especially impressed with the acting talent that chose to give this film a chance: Lin Shaye (Snakes on a Plane, There's Something About Mary), Elaine Hendrix (The Parent Trap, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion), and the wonderful character actor Michael Cavanaugh.  Keep an eye out for this up and coming writer/director!",1206662400,,794,4.866666666666666
8164567,5,B000LW7P5K,"Here is a terrific example of what can be done on a small budget. Down the PCH was chillingly honest and very disturbing. All of the characters played perfectly off each other and the writing was nothing short of top notch. With the drop in quality of many independent movies due to film producers and writers trying to give a more Hollywood flavor, it is refreshing to see that there are some indie filmmakers who are still willing to stand by their principles and produce real, raw, gritty films that reflect true life, not tinseltown ideals of life. For those not familiar with this gem, a teen and his friends are spiraling into a culture of drug dealing and drug taking to distance themselves from what they see is a life of capitalist ideals and parents who care more about their next big purchase than raising their children. Older brother who has been around the block and part of a cell block is released from prison and is appalled that his little brother is dealing with his teen years following in the footsteps he left behind when he went off to prison. Big bro hates the fact that lil bro is is getting into a scary world of thugs and drugs but feels powerless to stop him, plus, he has to build a new life for himself since he has just hit freedom after 2 years  locked up. Add to the mix a state assembly politician dad and a mom working at a teen suicide prevention hotline who is torn between what is right for her family and the image that their delinquent sons present to the voting public and you have the recipe for a very compelling drama. Older bro finally realizes that he is going to have to be the glue to put his family back together and his bond to lil bro is extremely touching and very real. If you see 1 independent film this year, Down the PCH should be the one. 5 stars+",1205020800,2,1804,4.337278106508876
8164568,4,B000LW7P5K,"Often independent films, especially those about drug dealers, etc., are histrionic and a little in your face and that's kind of what I expected.  Instead this movie is a very deliberate, sensitive film that reveals itself slowly.  The acting was also, for the most part, wonderful.  Michael Cavanaugh as the father was really exceptional, very subtle and real.  All the kids were good, especially Aaron Himelstein.  Guillermo Diaz was charming and chilling and played it wonderfully subtly, I am very interested in following his career.  Cy Carter was loathsome and very compelling.  Even Vincent Grashaw was very good for a good looking leading man type.  (And he is very good looking.)  I understand that this was his first real movie and it will be very interesting to see how he develops.  He has a great start here and it will be a surprise if his career doesn't explode, now.

The real revelation, however is Elaine Hendrix.  My God, that woman can act.  It was also quite interesting watching Lin Shaye's and Michael Cavanaugh's scenes together.  He was very real and understated and they played off each other extremley well.

This was the director's first full length movie and, besides a few minor jumps in logic, it is an exceedingly good effort.  I eagerly await his next effort.",1174953600,4,1291,4.880184331797235
