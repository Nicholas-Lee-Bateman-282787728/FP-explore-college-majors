1035727,5,6305466882,"This is the best Pokemon Tape of summer vacation. I'm a huge Pokemon fan. The episodes I saw were cool and funny. The funniest part is when Pikachu jumps on Team Rocket's helicopter and shocks away, while Team Rocket inside  yells ""IT CAN SHOCK US! IT CAN SHOCK US!"" Really funny. In  ""Abra and the Psychic Showdown"", we meet Sabrina for the first  time, who's gone rampant. Ash loses big time against her Kadabra, gets  shrunk down to minature size in her toybox but escapes. My favorite episode  so far, but what's up with the evil doll that resembles young Sabrina? In  my opinion, I think that the animators were going a little too far with the  evil doll(you'll see what I mean when you watch). Still, I recommend this  tape to any Pokemon fan.",940723200,3,749,4.496296296296296

7890021,5,6305466882,"Growing up in Topeka, Kansas when Pokemon was leaked into America was pretty awesome, seeing as it was launched in Topeka. When my brother and I were small, we had a modest little collection of these Pokemon videos. This was one of them, and this was the one out of the 10 or so that was mine, specifically.

I liked the supernatural atmosphere of The Ghost Of Maiden's Peak; Brock (Ash's friend) and James (of Team Rocket) are possessed by the supposed ghost of a woman that had died, presumably 2,000 years prior, waiting for her doomed lover to return from the war. Turns out, a Pokemon is behind the ghost's appearances. After that, there's Bye-Bye Butterfree; En route to Saffron City, Ash and his friends discover that the Butterfree mating season is taking place. Ash sets his loose to find a mate of it's own, but you can bet that Team Rocket isn't very far away. Will they make off with the Butterfree, and halt the mating season? The final episode on this video (which I have to point out, is my favourite episode in the entire series over) is Abra And The Psychic Showdown; Ash and friends arrive in Saffron City, in the hopes of challenging gym leader Sabrina, the mistress of psychic Pokemon. Early in the episode, the three are captured by Team Rocket, in another one of their faulty attempts to capture Pikachu. The are rescued by a mysterious little girl, and teleported to Sabrina's gym. Failing to heed the warning of a passerby who advises them not to go in, Ash challenges Sabrina and her Abra (who evolves into Kadabra mid-battle), and falls flat. She traps the three, who are soon-after rescued by the same passerby who advised against the battle in the first place. He advises them to go to Lavender Town and capture a ghost Pokemon, as to have a better chance of defeating Sabrina, upon returning.

The tape is very good, and all three episodes featured are fairly gripping. However, I wouldn't recommend it to very small children, or anybody that is easily scared. If that isn't a problem, it is definitely worth the purchase.",1399939200,,2051,4.647382920110193

When I bought this, I was happy that not only my questions were finally answered, but that it had things that I never thought would be on pokemon. Especially ""Bye bye butterfree""... I actually cried.",1333238400,,344,4.655737704918033

The disk itself doesn't have any scratches that I can see and plays nicely.

Bonus: It has the full length Pokerap!",1312329600,,380,4.352112676056338
7890025,4,6305466882,"The three episodes on this Pokemon tape are as follows:

""The Ghost of Maiden's Peak""-- Ash, Misty, Brock and of course Team Rocket end up at a seaside town called Maiden's Peak, just in time for the Summer's End Festival.
As it turns out, Brock is feeling rather down because this means he won't get to see any more beach girls for another year (sheesh, what a creep)...
Little does he know what's in store for him.  Upon arriving in town, Brock and James both notice a mysterious, beautiful girl standing on the pier.  However, just after they see her, they get distracted, and then they notice that the girl has disappeared a few seconds later.
Later on, during the festival, a mysterious old woman informs them that a beautiful woman will lead them to a cruel fate, but she doesn't give any specifics.
Then, as if things weren't strange enough already, our heroes (and Team Rocket) see a painting on display featuring the beautiful girl from the beach.  It then turns out that the girl turned to stone thousands of years ago, and that her figure still stands on the pier.
Brock and James go to visit the rock, and are both entranced by it, especially Brock.
In fact, he is so fascinated with the rock that he ends up staying there all evening, and though he tells Ash and Misty he'll come to the Pokemon Center by curfew, he never shows up.
Meanwhile, Jessie and Meowth decide to swipe the painting, but James is still more or less focused on the mystery girl.
During the night, the girl appears as a ghost... and creepy wackiness ensues.

In ""Bye Bye Butterfree"", it's Butterfree mating season, and Ash decides to let his Butterfree go.  However, when Butterfree finds the Butterfree of his dreams, he is rejected, and then as if to make matters worse, Team Rocket steals the entire Butterfree flock.  Ultimately, things turn out well, but unfortunately Ash has to release Butterfree into the wild.
I consider this to be the saddest episode in Pokemon history, tying with Pokemon Advanced's ""A Poached Ego"".  Of course it's a good episode, like just about every other, but it's really sad.

In ""Abra and the Psychic Showdown"", Ash and company are lost in the forest, and after meeting a mysterious little girl, they arrive in Saffron City.  They are then promptly caught by yet ANOTHER Team Rocket hoax, but are surprisingly rescued by the little girl, who seems to have supernatural abilities.
Ash then goes to battle the city's Gym Leader, Sabrina, despite the warnings of a mysterious man who says he would do well to stay away.
Upon arriving, Ash finds the mysterious little girl once again, not to mention Sabrina, who is extremely creepy, rather like her Pokemon Abra, who proceeds to evolve during the match and thoroughly defeat Pikachu.
Having been asked by the little girl to ""play with her"" if they lose the match, our heroes suddenly find themselves in a mysterious house... and upon realising that the house is in fact a dollhouse, they realise that the little girl meant it quite literally.  However, they are narrowly rescued by the mysterious man, who also seems to have telekinesis.  He tells them to leave Saffron City and never return.  However, Ash can't get into the Pokemon League without the Marsh Badge, and seeing how determined he is, the mysterious man advises him to go to Lavender Town and capture a Ghost Pokmon.  Later on, he says to himself that perhaps they're the ones who can rescue Sabrina.

In conclusion, this tape is of course good, and I'd recommend it if you're a Pokemon fan.",1128729600,,3522,4.694805194805195
