The story itself, of why do children have to suffer and die, is one worthy of discussion.  I think the movie would have more impact if the actors had been better able to express stronger emotions.  We know the kids are suffering and dying, but we don't feel their pain because it is not adequately expressed.  Still, for anyone who's child is dying or have a sibling or close friend who is dying, this movie would be a way of helping them open up about it.

When I was young, a friend of my brother was killed by a falling cemetery monument.  It was falling toward his little sister, and this nine-year-old boy sprang to deflect it from her, saving her life.  It helps one to cope with such a tragedy if one believes that God has a certain task for everyone to accomplish in this life, and once that task is finished, He takes them home to the perfection of Heaven.  For this little boy, the reason he was born was to, when the time came, save his sister from death because her task was not yet finished.  Now, he is with God where spiritual life is far superior to even the most joyful times of mankind.

Because this movie doesn't focus in on any particular reason for a child dying, such as that given above, it leaves the justification open for various explainations.  Therefore, parents should be prepared to explain their philosophy on why innocent children have to die young.",1207699200,2,1643,4.513513513513513
