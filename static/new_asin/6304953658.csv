7879990,2,6304953658,"This is a  tv movie that is not all that creative and the acting was poor.  Two kids learn that there is a small city in a jar.  Strange how they were able to snoop around a construction site, and unbelievable that they were able to locate a cave that is completely covered that none of the construction people knew about, yetl the kids knew to dig this specific location.  The kids were shrunk in and out of the city by the only person operating the supposed city even though we never saw the city because they were all in just one building (supposedly the rest of the city residents were in cryogenic state).  There was nothing to learn in this movie.  All that was happening was that there was a group of not-so-smart aliens in search of the this bottled up city to destroy it.  Not much explanation on why they had to destroy this city and why the engineer hid the city for thousands of years.  The kids are given a set number of hours to save the city from getting taken by these aliens or the city will burst into a large city that would destroy the existing city that the kids live in.  Pretty much throughout the movie, all we see is that the aliens were posing as humans and chasing the kids for the jar of the shrunken city.  Quite boring even with comedic moments that might be funny to a few kids.",1522108800,,1309,4.241935483870968

7879992,3,6304953658,"Good story but incidents are too unrealistic, the bottle is lost in the police. too easy entering the coffee plant, letting people check your home without knowing them, police believe the fake professor and the museum stories with no proof, police (oods in disguise) run in the public park but people don't care!!! I mean do these things happen? But deep down it gotta good story!",1514851200,,380,4.7727272727272725
7879993,2,6304953658,"A very slow moving, sci-fi/fantasy tale that involves two 13 year olds being chased all around Philadelphia trying to save two civilizations from the threat of extinction by a third.  Poorly acted, ponderous, and unimaginative.",1511740800,,227,5.485714285714286

7879998,5,6304953658,"I haven't seen THE SHRUNKEN CITY in a while but it's about these two kids named George and Lori. They discover this very tiny city stuck in a glass bottle and must save it from the bad guys, I think. Anyways, this is a great movie and the plot is very good. Also, the kid who plays George is cute, too! The acting is great and the movie is not corny. A must-see.",991526400,,362,3.9726027397260273
