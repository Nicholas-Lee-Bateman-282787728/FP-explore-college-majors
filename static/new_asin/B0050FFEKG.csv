8451144,5,B0050FFEKG,"It is a pitty, that this DVD is in the NTSC format only and european DVD players and TV's don't support this DVD. PAL would be bettter to be possible to see this DVD not only by PC's. I think it isn't so great problem to convert and distribute this DVD in the PAL format as well.
