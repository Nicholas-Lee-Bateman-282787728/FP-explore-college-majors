8677334,5,B000K4X5T4,My daughter is 12 and is in love with this particular series of Batman cartoons.  Unfortunately they don't air until after her bedtime.  So she requested a certain episode.  That was all she wanted for her birthday. So I got her the 1st and 2nd season episodes.  She loves it!!  I also plan to get all other episodes.,1237766400,,317,4.396551724137931
