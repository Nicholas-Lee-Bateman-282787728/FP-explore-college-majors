8266712,5,B0017ONPV4,"There is some things that they missed that would have been better.  I was there and the flight deck was a mess but they missed all the stuff that went on below decks.  I had to carry 28 bodies out of one compartment by myself because the rest on my team could not do it and I will not say anything bad about them, some can do it and others can not.

8266713,5,B0017ONPV4,I myself almost caused a fire when i was in the navy working on A-7E aircraft weapons. This fire was terrifying and made me shake while i watched it. Knowing i very well could have caused an exact same situation as the Forrestal fire. Navy rules are written in blood.... Corey,1409961600,,276,4.431372549019608

8266716,5,B0017ONPV4,I love this video because the man Gerald Farrier was my hometown.  I did my student teaching with his widow and learned so much from her.  It shows how he sacrificed his life to help the other men on the ship,1308009600,,208,4.048780487804878
