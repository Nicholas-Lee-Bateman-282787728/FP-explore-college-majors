8424570,5,B004D0B3AE,This DVD brought back beautiful memories I shared with my beloved father in 1960.  I was too young to vote but I wanted to vote for Kennedy.  The DVD was really clear and made you think you were back in 1960.,1477612800,,208,4.048780487804878

Debates were better than this years!

8424572,5,B004D0B3AE,"I was there, I watched, two great debaters, but one who used statistics with fervor and in an animated fashion. Kennedy's later personal life has certainly diminished his overall popularity, but as a political speaker, in my opinion, he had no equals. Kent Oram",1411689600,2,261,4.954545454545454
8424573,4,B004D0B3AE,"I was a child back when I watched these debates.  I sat and watched the B&W TV flicker and jump, but I watched.  I get that feeling when i watch this film.  Although a little boring at first, listen and digest what is being said.  This was totally new territory being entered by having these two fellows stand beside each other and exchange comments, as if a mental chess game is being played.  Neither were owned by any conglomerate, and neither had to meet with any of the Bush family for an endorsment, and instructions on what to think say or do.  Both were as independent as they could be, determined to get to the presidency.  Little was known back then as the Cuba problem, Castro, missiles, civil rights, so forth.  At least if it were known, it was not discussed openly.
this film take you back if you were there when it all took place, or it can be a great comparison to these lemmings we are presented with today, to seek a most prestigious position with far less power than we are led to believe.  Senator Kennedy accepted the facial make-up offered to him, Nioxon did not.  Kennedy took nothing off V.P. Nixon, and stood tall, and honorably before him making much more logical sense.  His hair, language, posture, presidential appearance is right here in this film, and you can relive it all in this DVD from celluloid offering.
Kennedy was really something to me as a child then and now as an old man.  He motivated me to do better as I was growing up.  Although I was a lousy student, dumb as a roofing nail, uninterested in school.  but, JFK gave me a model of a man to pattern myself after.
I could barely stand up before my class and say my name on the first day of school, let alone stand before the nation, think on my feet and make a showing of myself so I could get votes.  It is not an easy challenge to think on your feet in public as these two were doing in the first televised presidential debates.  JFK as a senator, before this country's dive into macabre political scheming.  Neither of them had to meet any of the Bush family to seek their endorsement and approval as they do today.
It is all here in this little package, at times boring, at times memory teasing, but always interesting especially knowing now what happened to JFK after Nixon would leave Dallas on that very morning, Novermber 22, 1963.
I encourage each of you to get a copy of this, watch it, remember what we were and compare what we have become.
In JFK's memory, this film is where the nation was introduced to JFK.  Tricky Dick did not fair so well later on either and was ousted from office.  Primitive, basic questions and answered, challenges, and confrontations, verbal chess games on national TV, and both were good, but JFK performed better, more proud and eloquent, with more grasp of the issues.  Judge for yourself, and relive the days when JFK hadno idea he would be targeted for trying to do something good for this country, its citizens, and its furture generations.  The hidden cowards gunned him down, and his own government covered it up.
This is great piece to have if not just for posterity.  The first televised presidential debate. Share and compare, and you'll see why my generation wanted JFK in there to battle for us.  No one trusted Dick Nixon and later we would find out why.  A wily, deceptive man who lied as much as LBJ, with each breath.  Many of us would still be enjoying our sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters +great--, today, unlike today's politicians getting jobs living good sheltered lives because of who they are, avoiding war, being maimed, killed, coming home broken or in a box, who seem more than willing to send our children into war, while theirs attend colleges, and the good life.  Be introduced to JFK in this film, sit back and watch where it all started.  Then watch the circus' of today and compare.  Which clown could outwit, outsmart, outmaneuver JFK today?  Here it is!  History classes everywhere should be required to watch these debates.  Why aren't they?  History preserved here on DVD.  Thank you.  (when it pertains to JFk, sorry I get windy.)",1350950400,3,4117,4.548913043478261
