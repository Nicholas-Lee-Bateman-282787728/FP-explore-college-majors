3564064,5,B001F2W55U,Loved this!!  It was so much fun to watch something different for a change from the regular programming during the holidays.  Love british humor!!,1358640000,,146,5.041666666666667
3564065,5,B001F2W55U,Funny and not offensive like today's crap produced by Hollywood. British people have the best sense of humour !! No wonder we are going to hell in a handbasket.,1356393600,,160,4.551724137931035
3564066,5,B001F2W55U,"I always enjoy Brit Coms, but the Christmas Brit Com are great as-is this one.  Another great one is Keeping up Appearances Christmas.",1335225600,2,134,4.826086956521739
3564067,1,B001F2W55U,"This so called comedy is absolutely awful. The acting is bad, the so called comedy is overdone by pedantically over emphasizing the lines the actors, directors or writers thought were funny. Essentially, not worth the postage! War and Peace has more laughs than these travesties",1320019200,,278,5.2
3564068,4,B001F2W55U,"Familiar Britcom faces from the 70's and 80's abound in this collection of holiday-themed episodes from the vaults of London Weekend Television and Yorkshire Television.

Highlights include Molly Sugden playing mostly to type as an office executive (MY HUSBAND AND I) and an estranged mother (THAT'S MY BOY); Arthur Lowe is a loveable and cranky Irish priest in BLESS ME FATHER; Peter Bowles, Richard Wilson and James Bolam raise temperatures in the hospital comedy ONLY WHEN I LAUGH; Usually serious John Thaw excels as a playboy dad, newly saddled with teenaged children (HOME TO ROOST) and Sid James' rioutous suburban holiday in ALL THIS AND CHRISTMAS TOO.

Many hidden gems lurk within this 2 DVD collection (which clocks in at just under TEN hours): The quip-filled cockney romance of WATCHING; A daydreaming young man's search for romance (and parental approval) in BILLY LIAR; Prim, proper and pear-shaped marital infidelity on holiday (DUTY FREE); Workplace hi-jinx as only the Brits can pull it off in THE RAG TRADE; and a group of madcap lady pensioners run riot in YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG TWICE.

Sure, there are a few clinkers in this set (surely there was a better episode of PLEASE, SIR! out there?), but the gold nuggets FAR outweigh the coal.

The video source material is surprisingly good for programmes shot (mostly) on 70's/80's videotape, with clear strong audio (but no subtitles).

Overall, VERY highly recommended for the British TV comedy fan, especially if you're looking for something other than the same-old, same-old Britcom material found on PBS or BBC America.",1261958400,41,1586,5.108108108108108
3564069,5,B001F2W55U,"I watched this on Christmas day, and it brought back so many memories of being in England and watching these old comedies.  Great stuff if you English and love the old classics I recommend it.",1230422400,20,192,4.485714285714286
3564070,1,B001F2W55U,This DVD was a big disappointment. We expected the comedies like Are You Being Served and Keeping Up Apperances. Instead we got very very old shows that were not that funny.,1229904000,7,173,4.612903225806452
