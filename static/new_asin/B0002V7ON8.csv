2120977,4,B0002V7ON8,"I didn't want to like this movie.  I'm usually resistant to any film whose director grinds an ax so relentlessly as Oliver Stone has been known to, and never so obviously as with this film.  But I recently ran across the NY Times list of 1000 best films, and ""Born On the Fourth of July"" is listed there.  While  any such list is naturally debatable, it caused me to want to see more of those on the list that I hadn't seen, and a satellite channel was running this film at a convenient time.  I must say, the excellence of Stone's craftsmanship, and of Tom Cruise's performance, wore down my resistance to his message, although it took almost half of this lengthy biopic to get past my defenses.

What we have here is the true story of a man whose birthday coincides with that of his country, a young man who was properly raised to love all things American.  His patriotism led him to volunteer for the Marine Corps and the Vietnam war in the late 1960s, where everything he had ever believed was challenged in the strongest possible terms.  The watershed events that finally moved him from traditional all-out American patriot to an American who loves his country but distrusts the government and opposes war, however, were events that mostly followed that famously horrifying war, and said events were often as horrifying in their own way as the things he experienced in Vietnam.

This truly is an excellent film, no doubt about it.  Stone, a Vietnam vet himself, frames his story expertly, brings out superb performances from all of his players, and included Mr. Kovic (on whose autobiographical book this film is based) at every stage of the production.  The pacing of the tale is smooth and understandable for its nearly 2-1/2 hour length, and the viewer never has a serious problem wondering where Cruise's character is coming from emotionally or intellectually.

""Born On the Fourth of July"" has proven to be the capstone of Oliver Stone's career, and was the performance that took Tom Cruise from teen idol to respected actor.  No wonder, as Cruise at times does more in this film with a look than he had been able to accomplish with pages of dialogue earlier in his career.

As with almost any 'Nam film, the gore of battle and over-the-top filthy language of its scarred survivors mean that viewing it is more of a cathartic experience than a pleasant one, but beyond that my only nitpick is that one scene has some vets listening to Don McLean's ""American Pie"" in 1968, three years before the song was recorded.  With that minor caveat, the film has given me a lot to think about.  While I don't agree with Stone's politics, there is no question that he, Kovic, and others have arrived at their perspective honestly and forcefully, and this film serves as a fine record of a time in our country's history when we fought a second civil war of sorts.  Men like Stone and Kovic are the living casualties of that time, and they deserve our respect.",1107043200,91,2956,4.642994241842611
2120978,5,B0002V7ON8,i agree with everyone who gives this movie 5 stars-- its brilliant moving & everyThIng a great film drama should be-- AS WELL AS being true and well written & heart felt in spades  !!! cruise threw himself so whole heartedly into this role and with such brilliant effect-- i believe it was this film that built the foundation for cruise`s career to reach the pinnacle of the  game that it has---- i don't think anyone has ever made more money in film than he has--- but this movie offered him a rare opportunity--that can make a career---the convergence of all the elements that make  miracles happen-- passionate script heartfelt and true-- and a director in mr stone who totally empathized w kovic`s memoir of a war that mangled a nation and a man but brought out true heroism and a real change of character  ultimately---if we as a nation haven't seemed to have learned from the kind of revelations contained in this celluloid-- we as individuals can find solace and inspiration from it-- and in time perhaps a great shift will occur--as each soul finds the truth and beauty worth living for instead of dying for---and we fight the good fight----but until then we can thank the oliver stones and ron kovics and tom cruises and all their minions who care enough to commit themselves to create something like this !,1103500800,,1316,4.6594827586206895
2120979,5,B0002V7ON8,"""The Church blessed the war. Communism, the insidous evil.

They-they told us to go. Thou shall not kill women & children. Thou shall not kill women & children, ma. Thou shall not kill women & children. Isn't this what you taught us?"" - Ron Kovic melts down in front of his parents in ""Born On The Fourth Of July""

Oliver Stone's powerful film, based on the true story of Vietnam Vet., Ron Kovic, still packs a punch after fourteen years since its Christmas 1989 release and has the best performance that Tom Cruise has given in his entire career. Sadly, the film didn't sweep the Oscars like ""Platoon"" did, and, no, Cruise didn't win that year for Best Actor (that honor went to Morgan Freeman for ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Say it with me people, ""What the *u*k!?!).

""Born"" starts out in the late 50's as we meet a young, impressionable Ron Kovic who plays war with his pals in the backyard and has a sweetie named Donna. The film sets up the major characters & Kovic's family and then jumps to his Senior Year in High School, in the early sixties.

A visit from the local Marine Recruiter at his high school easily convinces Kovic and some of his buddies to join the Marine Corp., fully aware that they may be the first to head into battle, and the nightmare that would be Vietnam.

The film segues to the year 1967 & Kovic's first tragedy trying to come to grips with accidently killing a fellow soldier in the heat of battle & then his commanding officer telling him to, basically, forget what happened. In 1969, his personal hell begins as he is shot twice, one in the heel of his foot and with a second shot to his upper chest, severly damaging his spinal column, Kovic is paralyzed for life from the waist down.

With such a severe injury, Ron Kovic is sent home, but just as he has found that war is hell, the road home has its nightmarish twists & turns. Coming to grips with all that has transpired & with the ever changing world around him, Ron Kovic quickly learns its a long road home.

This is easily one of Oliver Stone's best films side-by-side with ""Platoon"". While ""Platoon"" gives us the sweaty, gory, backstabbing, hellish nightmare that was the Vietnam War, ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" gives us the other side of the nightmare, the war at home, in its all its unflinching darkside glory.

Stone's direction is top-notch. ""Born on the Fourth of July"" is shot with red, white, & blue hues (red for the battle sequences, blue for the tragic scenes and white for the dream sequences). The film doesn't capture the essence of the 60's & 70's, it embraces it (the scenes of Massapequa in the 60's is all Americana while the Massapequa of the 70's seems lost, trying to forget or demonstrate against the war. The town's innocence is truly lost). The Vietnam action sequences are filmed documentary guerrilla style.

The cast is absolutely outstanding. Tom Cruise is at the top of his game in this film. Rumor has it, this film destroyed his marriage to Mimi Rogers. Cruise spent a lot of time in the wheelchair, getting all the movements right & preparing for the role, so when filming began everything came second nature to him. Also, keep an out for small roles from Billy Baldwin, Stephen Baldwin, Holly-Marie Combs (T.V.'s ""Charmed""), Vivica A. Fox (she's the hooker in the hospital ward at night), Michael Wincott (""Alien Ressurection"" & ""The Crow""), John McGinnley (""Scrubs"" & ""Platoon"") & Wayne Knight (Newman from ""Seinfeld"" & ""Jurassic Park"").

As for this third DVD release for ""Born On The Fourth Of July"", I really wish it was a special edition, but, its not. This version combines the previous two (before this release, you had a choice between the 30 dollar Dolby Digital version, or the 30 dollar DTS version) with Dolby Digital & DTS audio with a commentary track by Oliver Stone. The only special feature is a NBC backstory segment that delves into the network's archives retrieving interviews with Stone, Cruise, & Kovic from the film's press junket in 1989. Its a half-assed affair with, of all people, Bryant Gumble hosting.

With ""Born"" ending with Ron Kovic speaking at the National Democratic Convention in 1976 & the film itself being released 13 months before the first Gulf War, it would be interesting to catch up with Kovic & to see his views on the war in Iraq, stem cell research, & how he feels the country is doing. Sadly, ""Universal"" doesn't share these ideas and the DVD presentation sucks. The picture definitely needs to be remastered. The audio is decent with 5.1 surround.

""Born On The Fourth Of July"" is like the colors of the American Flag.

They don't run.

For Truth, Justice, & The American Way.

God Bless Our Troops & American Veterans.

Above All, God Bless America.",1100131200,5,4724,4.632775119617225
2120980,5,B0002V7ON8,"Oliver Stone is one of the most interesting directors of all time and this movie is definitely in his best top 5.  Tom Cruise's portrayl of Ron Kovic is chilling to say the least.  Anyone who is a fan of ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" or Stone's ""Platoon,"" will really enjoy this film.  When I think of Vietnam themed movies, this one is on the top of my list.  The movie I think it resembles most is ""Coming Home,"" with Jon Voight, but I enjoyed this movie a lot more.  It's not amazing that this controversial movie became so liked when it was first released at the box office.  If you want to see one of the best directors and Tom Cruise's best work, this movie is for you.  It didn't make the AFI 100 greatest movies probably because of ""Platoon's"" entry.  Oliver Stone deserved his best director academy award for this terrific movie.  I think this is definitely one of the top 5 greatest films of the 1980's.",1099785600,4,920,4.396449704142012
2120981,5,B0002V7ON8,"Oliver Stone captures the feel and look of the era, and Tom Cruise nails his role as Ron Kovic.  This film will hit upon every emotion you have...it is a brilliant film.  Wish there were more extras on the DVD though.",1098230400,4,217,4.2682926829268295
2120982,5,B0002V7ON8,"Oliver Stone gives Cruise his best role as Ron Kovic in ""Born on the Fourth of July.""  Cruise forgoes his easy way out with a smile and shows (as he has in several other films) he really has acting chops.

It is impossible not to be moved by Cruise's inhabiting the life of Ron Kovic and to feel the pain, the displacement and abandonment Kovic - and thousands of other soldiers - must have felt.  That Kovic was a patriot, a hero actually born on the 4th of July makes his outspoken acts of anti-war activism resonate all the more.

Those - like me - who have accused this actor of not being to act his way out of the proverbial paper bag should take a look at Mr. Cruise here.  Watching his Kovic from idealistic young man, to disenchanted hero, to miserable self-pitying to inspiration and a voice the voice of realism for a generation realist will be nothing less than wowed.  At each step, Cruise puts Kovic first and foremost and makes believable every emotion.  There is more than self-pity when, knowing how he's going to spend the balance of his life he cries ""who will love me?""  It will break your heart and fill you with rage all at once.

The supporting cast, under Stone's direction bring alive a harrowing story - a true story.

The extras on this special wide screen version are not worth shouting about - but are worth noting.  As is standard with many DVD's these days the director gives an informative narration during the film which is worth listening to, but (in my opinion) inteferes with the film (unless you watch it twice in a row).

Worthwhile and recommended.",1098144000,23,1586,4.487804878048781

2121103,4,B0002V7ON8,"I do not appreciate anti-American Oliver Stone flicks in general.  I don't appreciate relentless Leftwingery trying to trash this country or refuse to ever even acknowledge that this country's relentless fight against Communism on multiple fronts, finally achieved peacefully (BY RONALD REAGAN) was one of the greatest accomplishments of humanity.  I don't appreciate their failure to acknowledge the sacrifice of our Vietnam vets DID ultimately save the world from Communist threats which were of the utmost necessity.  What I'm trying to say is I'm opposed to this type of movie in every possible way.  However, Hollywood IS stridently Leftist and takes special joy in destroying American patriotism -- so this movie should have rewarded Tom Cruise for successfully achieving that end at the Oscars.

Even though I despise the message and many of the messengers involved in this project, Tom Cruise's tour de force acting job was a sight to behold.  He goes from young, perfect GQ solider to transforming into the angry, paralyzed author of this tale in a way that has so much character and depth that you are brought along a journey rather than feeling too emotionally manipulated.  It's akin to the equally relentlessly Leftwing work of Sean Penn that is so fascinating to watch that whether or not you agree with THEIR interpretation you still feel amazed and rewarded for having watched the performance.  The Hollywood Oscars are a joke.  Women win in their late 30's early 40's by getting the ""I Want to Sleep With Her"" vote (Halle Berry, Kim Bassinger etc) and then disappear when they dare to look 40.  Men who are too attractive get NO men's votes and split the women's vote so they never win.  Good looking males win after they lose their looks for a great career, in their 60's etc. and get to work until they need Depends.  It's the most sexist, ageist industry on the planet.

I recall Cruise having been nominated for this role but he was at the height of his career, too many jealous male actors couldn't hand a man in his prime the prize.  When you watch Cruise go from pin up boy to aged, bald parapalegic with such spunk and truth that you never feel sorry for him but do feel you're getting an important view into another man's soul you'll be amazed Hollywood -- land of Communist, sexist, ageist pigs-- refused to give him his prize.  Don't worry, Mr Cruise.  As soon as you reach elder statesman level you'll get your award for this movie and a handful of others as a sort of Lifetime Achievement award.  I recommend this movie to people of any background: people who like Cruise and those who don't, people who hate Oliver Stone and those who love him, and pretty much anybody except young kids.

It's a bit of slog though, so it's not for a light, fluffy pick me up.  It is NOT escapist fun.  The movie has the bells and whistles of watching someone age that often grabs prizes but it does so in a way that Cruise is somehow able to pull off as few actors can -- he maintains a vigor and watchable fire that you pull for him and enjoy him more than someone who gives up and tries to make you feel sorry for their character.  Cruise might be crazy, might be the highest profile member of a strange and vicious cult (Scientology), might be an annoying pretty boy (especially back then, which I enjoyed but others might not), might be directed by an anti-American bigot with no respect for American achievement, but I feel enriched for having seen this movie.

Someday, if the Left would be as willing to listen to the other side we'd all get along fine again, but until that day just know that those on the Right do give people a chance.  If Oliver Stone really understood our country we'd all be better off but at the end of the day, it's Tom Cruise who singlehandedly made this movie.  Only a few actors reach these heights and it is worth watching when you're in the mood for a substantial tour de force.  Not for afternoon fluff, but when you're ready for an experience.",1428105600,,3996,4.610169491525424

*** *** ***

BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (1989) is a film regarding the reaction of the American public to the U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam. In a nutshell, the film concerns the changing attitudes of Tom Cruise, who is initially a patriotic 18 year old, and who after receiving a crippling war injury, remains patriotic, then enters a period of existential anxiety regarding his place in the world, and then eventually becomes a focused and dynamic antiwar activist.

The film includes several scenes that are absolutely stunning:

(1) BRONX HOSPITAL. The scene in the Bronx VA hospital portrays the squalor of a poorly funded hospital, where the orderlies prefer to spend their time playing cards instead of tending to the injured war veterans, where rats meander about the floor, where hookers provide services to the crippled veterans, and where the medical doctors appear to be about 25 years old. It is interesting to point out the issue of young and inexperienced doctors also materializes in the film, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, where Helen Hunt complains about doctors being only ""nine years old.""

(2) MOTHER'S MELT DOWN. Another great scene occurs in Tom Cruise's home in Massapequa (a real town) on Long Island, where Tom Cruise is undergoing a change in attitude regarding America's position in Vietnam. Tom Cruise is in the progress of realizing that America's leaders had tricked the American public into buying into the Vietnam War, and Tom Cruise angrily curses the war, using the Lord's name in vain. Earlier scenes in the movie had established that Tom's mother (Caroline Kava) has a shallow version of Christian ethics, and is vehement in forbidding Playboy magazine, and in forbidding the use of the Lord's name in vain. The film discloses that Caroline Kava's self esteem and self image is built entirely on this shallow version of Christian ethics. And when Tom Cruise, paralyzed from the waist down, curses the war and curses American leadership for tricking the American public, and uses the Lord's name in vain, what happens is that Caroline Kava's sand castle of self esteem crumbles away, and she has a melt down, and she drives her son out of the house (permanently). In my opinion, it is likely that this scene is the best-available portrayal of the polarization of the American public, during the Vietnam war era, regarding American citizens who are pro-war and anti-war. Truly, the scene where Tom Cruise argues with his mother, is one of the finest scenes ever committed to film.

(3) VISIT TO VENUS, GEORGIA. During Tom Cruise's term in Vietnam, as shown in the film, he shoots at the enemy who was using a village of thatched houses for cover. In shooting at the enemy, Tom Cruise and other Marines kill a number of civilians, resulting in the death of woman, children, and babies. A recurring image in this film is the sound of a crying Vietnamese infant. This image of the slaughtered civilians, and the crying baby, in their thatched hut, haunts Tom Cruise. Also, the film shows Tom Cruise's unintentional shooting of one of his subordinates, a 19 year old Marine from Venus, Georgia. (Please note that, according to journalist Patrick Buchanan, Southeast Missourian, Cape Girardeau, MO, Feb. 28, 1990, there does not exist any town called Venus, in the State of Georgia.).

At any rate, the fact that he had killed his fellow Marine weighs heavily on Tom Cruise's mind, and he visits the Marine's grave in Venus, GA, and then he takes at taxi to visit the family of the Marine. Several dogs meander about the front yard in front of the home of the dead Marine. The father of the dead Marine greets Tom Cruise. The father obese and about 60 years old, and rather deteriorated in appearance. His English is not the greatest. The man is basically, redneck trailer trash. Tom Cruise is invited inside, and we see the mother of the Marine. The mother is skinny and in her 60s, and she is not pretty, and she has very skinny lips, and she has a large mole that is situated off center on her chin. The mother also speaks English indistinctly, in the manner of trailer trash. The scene inside the home of the dead Marine is one of the greatest scenes, every committed to film. The movie camera lovingly caresses the war memorabilia and photographs, from earlier generations of this Georgia family, that is, from WWI and WWII. Also in the home, is the dead Marine's widow. The young widow says, ""I cannot forgive you, but maybe the Lord will."" The scene is stunningly acted, and as it develops, the viewer wonders if Tom Cruise will reveal that he is the one who killed his fellow Marine. Actually, I was surprised at the fact that Tom Cruise spills all, and actually reveals that he is the one who killed the 19 year old. The skinny mother (Caroline Kava) understands, and comments on the pain that must have been felt by Tom Cruise.

OTHER COMMENTS. Raymond Barry plays the stoic father of Tom Cruise. Caroline Kava plays the mother of Tom Cruise. Her self esteem is based on a shallow version of Christian ethics. Caroline Kava appears in other movies, e.g., Presumed Guilty (1991), Year of the Dragon (1985), Snow Falling on Cedars (1999), Nobody's Child (1986), Final (2001), and Little Nikita (1988). Kyra Sedgwick plays the high school sweetheart of Tom Cruise. In real life, Kyra Sedgwick is married to Kevin Bacon, and she has appeared in about 40 movies. The siblings of Tom Cruise were selected because they have the same type of ethnic appearance (the shape of their mouths are the same). The fact that they look the same, at least in this way, makes the movie more interesting and more convincing. It is my guess, that this appearance is found in persons from Sicily.

Willem Dafoe plays another Vietnam veteran who, like Tom Cruise, received a crippling injury in Vietnam, and is confined to a wheelchair. Willem Dafoe only appears in the part of the film taking place in Mexico. Cordelia Gonzalez plays a hooker at a Mexican brothel. Everything is revealed, and viewers of this film might enjoy the excellent morphology of Cordelia Gonzalez. Cordelia Gonzalez also appeared in the movie MAMBO KINGS, the movie THE CALLER, and in various television dramas, e.g., LAW AND ORDER, KOJAK, and THE EQUALIZER.

Regarding the crowd scenes at the Republican convention, and at the antiwar demonstrations, no expense was spared by the movie studio in making these scenes as realistic as possible. I have seen student demonstrations, and tear gas bombs shot by the police in the years 1969 and 1970, in Berkeley, California. Thus, I have been a first hand witness to a real antiwar demonstration. The opening scenes in this movie portray typical adolescent life during the early 1960s, including a scene showing kids at a drug store looking over the latest issue of MAD MAGAZINE. Baby boomers will be delighted by the scenes that reproduce culture from the early 1960s. A similar excellent portrayal of ordinary American life in the era of the late 1950s or early 1960s, is found in BACK TO THE FUTURE, especially, in the scenes at the malt shop and at the gas station.

Wow...what a surprise!  i won't recount the story as so many others have done that here.  I just want to add my five star vote to the others.  Oliver Stone has such a capacity for looking at the deepest, most raw emotions and showing them just as they are.  Whether it's seeing Ron strapped to a bed in the military hospital, being abused by his caretakers, or watching him have sex with a Mexican whore, or confessing to the parents of the man that he killed....time after time I marvelled at how unflinching this film was. I can't think of any other film that has done this over and over with such honesty and intensity.

Ron Kovic's story is amazing and Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise both gave their all to do justice to it in this film.  The DVD has a bonus of Bryan Gumbell interviewing the three of them and it is wonderful to see the common commitment that they had to doing this right.

This is an important film, not just because of it's anti-war message, which is certainly as important now as it was when it was made, but because it is the story of personal transformation.  Ron Kovic went through bloody hell and came back and triumphed over his wounds.  This is a tale for every human being.  I recommend it highly.

He had flashbacks to some of the most awful parts of the war, and developed a pretty severe drinking problem. Eventually he got good and sick of the small town in Mexico to which he had escaped from reality, where a good many disabled veterans had professional ladies to teach them how to make the most of their limited physical condition. Finally, he and another paraplegic he met there returned to the US and became involved in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

2121136,5,B0002V7ON8,"""Born on the Fourth of July"" is the story of Ron Kovic, with a focus on his childhood, Vietnam service, and postwar life. Tom Cruise provides one of the most outstanding performances of his career playing Kovic, with an abundance of energy and passion. The movie delves into a side of war that is often out of sight, which is the path to rehabilitation following serious injury. Having been an instrument of war, who served without question, Kovic's transition from loyal servant to objector is well conveyed by a strong film narrative. It is his adjustment to living with physical restriction, and sharing his experiences with others that makes this a highly compelling film.

2121137,5,B0002V7ON8,"How powerful is one voice? Born on the Forth of July is a great film that is proving itself to be a classic. This film was directed by Oliver Stone and is arguably his best. This film is based on the autobiographical book titled Born on the Forth of July written by Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic. Tom Cruise plays Kovic, in a performance that earned him his first Academy Award nomination. Oliver Stone (himself a Vietnam veteran) co-wrote the screenplay with Kovic, and also produced and directed the film. There are countless films that have been made about war. This very well could be the best of them all. Born on the Forth of July  is the story of Vietnam Marine soldier that goes to Vietnam to fight for his county and comes home paralyzed. It is said that Kovic was inspired by President John F. Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"" speech. When Kovic comes home he has a different war to fight. The one within himself. Kovic eventually becomes an influential activist in the anti-war movement and was a speaker at the 1976 Democratic National Convention.  Ron Kovic presented Tom Cruise with his Bronze Star medal on the final day of filming Born on the Fourth of July explaining to the actor that he was giving him the award as a gift for his ""courageous portrayal of the true horrors of war."" Time Magazine reported that Oliver Stone said, ""He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there."" This is a real film that will test you in many ways. Ultimately the viewer will walk away wiser and more contemplative about the nature of war and government. Born on the Forth of July explains the different levels of patriotism and anti-patriotism and makes a strong argument for both sides. This is a historical motion picture everyone should watch at some point in their life. If this was shown in history classes the world would be a much different place. This is film making with a purpose. Watch. Think. Live.",1311033600,3,2062,4.555256064690027
2121138,4,B0002V7ON8,"Like other skeptics of this film, when I first picked it off the shelf, I was extremely skeptical of the film.  The cover looked pretty uninteresting, giving off the vibe of Coming Home or some other cheesy feel good hippy film with a hearty dose of sixties-seventies optimism.  It was directed by Oliver Stone, a man who is certainly not known for even handed portrayals of political subjects. And Tom Cruise, the pretty boy from the kitschy and lame beyond lame Top Gun, playing the lead?  How can this be any good of a film?

Well, I'm entirely certain that I was completely wrong, very wrong.  This is a great movie, and the somewhat cheesy cover art and packaging of the film misleads you into what could be one of the most painful war movies that deal with the aftereffects of war, easily on the same line as the Deer Hunter.  No, it's not as scary as being confined to replaying Russian Roulette over and over again, but it's most certainly an emotionally distressing, and Tom Cruise does a fantastic job getting all of the suffering and misery across.  I've always thought Tom Cruise is a better actor than people give him credit for, and despite how annoying he can off camera (not to mention his spotty filmography) he still can certainly put a good performance if he chooses the right ones.  With all of this in line, this is one war film that deserves more praise than it gets, especially among audiences and film enthusiasts.

Now, the film is not perfect (most films aren't, but that's another kettle of fish), and I know, like many Oliver Stone films, it's slanted towards the left; Vietnam the way Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic saw it (both very anti-war).  However, I feel that there certainly are many valid and interesting viewpoints made during the film, Also, Stone's genuine passion for the subject through experience makes it more worthwhile.  Most importantly though, it easily transcends these flaws with great acting, superb directing, great editing, a direct and raw approach to many of the displays of war (instead of extremely diminishing it with some stupid metaphor or symbol) and a spare-no-punches, gut instinct, intensity almost through the whole movie.  Best of all however, is it never loses touch with being a human.  For all the political points of view, Born on the Fourth of July, at heart, is still a humanistic study of one man's internal and external struggle with war, and it never loses it's characterization or real human struggles through any of it's views.

Anyway, this is a great film, near the same level as Oliver Stone's Platoon (still haven't seen Heaven and Earth).  While some of the content in this film is definitely fiction, it shouldn't stop you from seeing this great film.  Tom Cruise has never been better, and Oliver Stone spares no punches and goes right for the gut (and very much succeeds).  It all adds up for a very exhausting, but ultimately uplifting and rewarding film.  Very highly recommended.",1300060800,3,2964,4.767123287671233

This movie made me ashamed I did not stay gun ho or re-enlist and to go back to fight for the friends I lost but thanked God I go out in one piece.

2121149,3,B0002V7ON8,"In 1989 Oliver Stone came out with ""Born on the Fourth of July"", the true story of Ron Kovic, a gung-ho Marine who is paralyzed in combat in Vietnam. The film is realistic and compelling. Stone is a master and Tom Cruise as Kovic gives one of his best-ever performances, proving him to be a bona fide acting talent. The film depicts the heartbreaking American experience in Vietnam, and the character arc of Kovic is as complete as any ever captured. He returns home, desperate to believe that his sacrifice was in a noble cause, but this is chipped away by the well-known elements of '60s radicalism. The ""generation gap"" between longhaired youths and crew cut, religious parents is profound. Kovic sinks into the depravity of drugs and alcohol, but battles back to become a ""hero"" of the anti-war Left. He wheels into the 1972 Republican National Convention, where he tries to tell the clean-cut, well-heeled patriots that they are wrong and he is right. The idea is that they are all warmongers who have not fought, while he is a pacifist because he has. While there is truth to the premise, in choosing to tell this story, Stone establishes Hollywood as the home of solidly liberal ideas. In 1972, Nixon won 49 states over the ant-war McGovern. The idea that all those Americans, subject daily to reports from Peter Arnett and Dan Rather, the bias of Walter Cronkite, and the hate of the New York Times and the Washington Post, chose Nixon because they were bloodthirsty imperialists is just malarkey. Furthermore, Nixon had made 18-year olds eligible to vote. The concept that all of American youth protested in the streets is a myth. The anti-war movement was propped by TV that made pockets of outrage look like a widespread movement. The Silent Majority spoke out in '72. Big time.
Stone's depiction is fair in and of itself, but he takes advantage of the power of his medium in creating a mindset that such horrors as Kovic experienced are just part of the ""Vietnam experience."" Kovic's life mirrors soldiers going back to the Roman Legion and beyond. The Left has taken Vietnam as one of those core issues and stuck to it, just as they found themselves wedded to Alger Hiss, Bill Clinton and now the losing side of the War on Terrorism. McCarthy was going after genuine Communists, and genuine Communists were trying to enslave South Vietnam. It took some fighting to stop them. Nixon and Kissinger had the best plan available to them at the time, and the public recognized it. Watergate killed them and the Democrats used it to abandon our allies. Millions died because of them. Democrats will have you believe that we ""created"" the ""killing fields."" They have to say things like that, to cling to this nebulous theory, somehow unable to blame the rabid haters and murderers of Communist history, apparently because they are wedded to McCarthyism. Their movies are their best tool in perpetuating their lies. Not on my watch.",1233878400,9,2936,4.792899408284024

Though Born on the Fourth of July has its share of powerful and/or effective moments, nearly all of them occur in the film's first half; overlong, and with a tendency to ramble, this is a flawed film.",1229904000,,218,4.45
2121151,2,B0002V7ON8,"Everybody and their brother thinks this is a war film classic. I don't. I grew up in Massapequa, knew Ron Kovic (slightly), hung out at Arthur's Bar, got my hair cut at Sparky The Barber's, I played in Sally's Woods as a kid, and watched God knows how many holiday parades down Broadway. Growing up, they occurred on every major holiday except The Feast of The Assumption.

Massapequa's the kind of place you love and hate at the same time. It's a fly in the amber. The schools are excellent. Businesses like All-American and Krisch's Ice Cream Parlor have been there since 1955 and remain surprisingly unchanged. The town's underlying values remain intact, mostly because the kids that grew up there in the Fifties inherited their parents' houses and have passed them on to their kids now. On the Fourth of July the smoke from ""illegal"" fireworks is so dense that spy satellites can't penetrate it (this is a documented fact). There's been a spate of new construction, if you can consider a spate to have lasted 25 years, but beyond that, it's still home as I remember it.

So the ersatz Massapequa (a town in Vermont that they dressed up) in this film was a little disconcerting to me: ""Lemke Hardware wasn't even on the same street as Krisch's, and Krisch's is Krisch's, not Boyer's!""

Hollywood.

And this wasn't even the original film. The original BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY by Brian DePalma starred Al Pacino and was made, or partly made, in 1978. The Internet Movie Database tells me that the ""financing fell through"" but I can recall the Pequa Theater marquee showing ""Love Story"" during some filming. They were actually going to use Massapequa to represent Massapequa in that version.

Actually, the sets don't bother me half as much as Tom Cruise. Pacino would have made this movie a TRUE classic. Cruise is real good at playing the teenaged Ronnie Kovic, but he utterly blows the role once Ronnie Gets His Gun. Cruise spends most of the movie overacting shamelessly, like yelling ""Penis, penis, penis!"" in a badly-acted ""drunk"" scene, and turning the heart-rending bitter anger of Ron Kovic's searingly sad book into something like pablum for the ease of audience digestion. We needed grit and despair in this movie. We got Tom Cruise, and not the Tom Cruise of A FEW GOOD MEN or THE LAST SAMURAI, we got the Tom Cruise of Jumping On Oprah's Couch Tom Cruise.

War is hell. It should be presented as such. And so should it's hellish consequences. Like the Massapequa it presents the Ron Kovic of this film is not the real deal.",1219449600,6,2539,4.69438202247191
2121152,4,B0002V7ON8,"I'm no fan of Oliver Stone (see my 1 star review for Platoon) or his politics, and even though this film's ultimate ""message"" is overtly political (Vietnam was a worthless cause, based on lies) and somewhat mendacious in pushing that left-wing agenda (it was the Republicans' fault), I still rate it highly based solely on its portrayal of Ron Kovic's personal story. This movie depicts with heartbreaking realism the experience of an All-American boy who comes home from the Vietnam War paralyzed from the waist down. Surely it can't be considered political to tell that story, can it? That would be the specious and self-interested argument of your typical neocon warmonger, who would like to keep the cameras away from Walter Reed, where the 19 and 20 year old victims of their phony war learn to cope with life without arms or legs or recognizably human faces. I think it's a good thing for the flag-waving public to understand the consequences of their jingoism and see what soldiers have to sacrifice. This movie makes that lesson quite clear. It can be raw and explicit, but so is getting your spinal cord snapped in two. Tom Cruise gives a fantastic performance here, the supporting cast is first rate, and the extraordinary attention to visual detail combine to create a moving and powerful film. My one complaint is that it doesn't really explain Kovic's conversion from super-patriot to anti-war activist, and represents him as a singularly inarticulate spokesman, at that. It seems to present his argument as amounting to nothing more than ""I'm mad"" and ""The government lied!"". Perhaps the real life Kovic had a more cogent position, but I didn't get that from the movie.

The most powerful nation on earth, having free speech and a free press, duped into a totally unnecesary and even counterproductive war?  A Congress fooled by a dissembling and deceitful administration, with few dissenters.

Well, it happened again in 2003, and watching this movie, one of my favorites, is even more heartbreaking now  than it was when I first saw it years ago.  It's a period piece starting in the '50s, beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly capturing the spirit of three decades that I know well from personal experience.  It's the story of Ron Kovic, who volunteered for duty in Vietnam, was severely wounded, and returned to find that not only had the war been unnecessary, but he and his fellow veterans were not all that welcome, especially when they started exercising their rights to protest the continuation of the war.

This is Stone's best movie by far.  The joys of family life, the horrors of war, the pain of catastrophic injury, the trauma of alienation, the exhilaration of redemption... all are depicted movingly and accurately.  In this movie, Stone is uncharacteristically as understated as John Williams' wonderful score.  There are scenes, such as when Cruise's character, based on a real story, returns to his old neighborhood on Long Island to find his parents,family, and neighbors uneasily prepared for him, that always bring tears to my eyes.  But that is just one of many such scenes.

Stone also is dead-on in his depiction of the attitude of the American public toward returning Vietnam veterans and the veterans' despair and bitterness.  Alas, I fear that we have not seen yet the development of those same feelings as we have yet to see very many returning Iraq War veterans in this war, which never made any sense, but we will.

It's amazing to watch this movie again now and to see all the parallels with Vietnam, beginning with the killing of innocent civilians, confusion in the fighting, deaths of minority and working class kids, etc.

Like I said, it is heartbreaking to see this happen again, but this movie ought to be re-released or be shown in schools. Of course, being realistic, it has so much profanity and explicit references to sex that it will never be seen by those who ought to see it--impressionable kids who are brainwashed by government propaganda.

A side note:  George W. Bush was probably at the 1972 GOP Convention that is depicted in the last part of this movie, so he was probably there when Ron Kovic and other Vietnam Veterans against the War were spit upon and gassed by police.  Why John Kerry and his campaign did not bother to mention this--and a number of other things having to do with unnecessary wars--in the 2004 campaign is beyond me.

Kovic served twice in Vietnam (I wished nobody had gone...) and was paralized after being shot twice. Coming back to the US, he is treated worse than a pig in a farm in a hospital for Viet vets. At the beginning, he is a strong supporter of the cause of war (I don't recall this being told in the book), and uses the ""Love It or Leave It"" BS that I've heard some other place (I mean, is there anything more American than speak freely? Isn't that Democracy?) Soon, though, he realizes how that war is a big lie, and starts joining demonstrations against the war.

As in Platoon, we see waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. There are some very tough scenes that would make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill innocent women and children. Then, Kovic shoots, by mistake, an American soldier, blinded by the sun, and, also, by the brutality and ferocity or war.

Cruise is absolutely gorgeous in this movie, and Oliver Stone won an Oscar for best director. In my opinion, this movie is better than Platoon, because we get to see the life of a soldier before he becomes a soldier. Then we see him fighting, and afterwards, when he is a Vet. So we have the whole picture, and that makes more sense to me than Platoon (even though Platoon is an excellent movie). Tom Berenger and Dafoe have both short appearences here. And that is nice!

This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully.

Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch. A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us. Everybody should ask themselves: war ... is it worth it? What for ... ?",1151020800,7,3272,4.3927392739273925
2121159,5,B0002V7ON8,"There have been many similar movies around this theme (Coming home still remains by far as the unbeatable film about his delicate issue) but what it confers this gripping and awful story that touch of grandness is the merciless, intense and real approach so typical of Oliver Stone.

There are three remarkable aspects that basically, consolidate and reaffirm this movie as the best artistic achievement of Stone; the crudeness and incisiveness of this bitter script; the best performance given by Tom Cruise in his career and the unforgettable devastating images along the film, as that mesmerizing and metaphorical fight on the desert of Cruise and Dafoe.

To my mind I must insist, this is the majuscule achievement in Oliver Stone's career.",1146614400,5,744,5.140495867768595
2121160,5,B0002V7ON8,"Oliver Stone was at the top of his game when this film was made in 1989 starring Tom Cruise.  It follows the true story of Ron Kovic's life from 1950s idyllic childhood to Vietnam Veteran war protestor. Beginning during a fourth of July parade in 1956 we cut to the JFK inaugural address (oops, five years later and young Ron hasn't aged).  His mother says she had a dream that Ron was speaking before a large crowd saying important things.  This dream turns out to be prophetic and the ending is always moving.

Cruise gives a great portrayal as Ron who's paralyzed by wounds and transforms into a spokesmen for Vietnam Vets.

  Vietnam is long over, but the effects go on.  Those of veterans and those of lessons learned and not learned.  Will our country ever learn that war is wrong?",1134864000,4,787,4.524822695035461
2121161,3,B0002V7ON8,"To say that Cruise and Stone are seasoned is an understatement, so I expected this to be a classic that I had been missing for the last 15 years. Well, not really.

This film was really exhausting for me. I thought it was too long, and I started to lose interest about 90 minutes in. It actually took two sittings for me to be able to finish it. The performance that Cruise offers is outstanding, but the not-so-subtle political narrative really struck me as routine and very predictable for Hollywood.

The film skips a large portion toward the end in which Cruise emerges as a notable public speaker, but it isn't explained how or why. The film concludes, framing his story as a triumph of character not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump. I wish I had enjoyed it more.

Top Gun and The Color of Money remain my choice Cruise films from the 80's.",1119398400,4,846,4.48051948051948
2121162,5,B0002V7ON8,"Good movies entertain. They make you laugh and cry. Great movies leave a mark on you. You think about the movie, what it means, and you talk about it for days. It changes your perception of things on many levels. This is one those movies. I am still in awe of the movie that I have watched maybe 6 times. Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise have brought a brilliant story about the war to life.

First of, this is not exactly a war movie, but it revolves around a war. It shows the effects of the war to the people who were in it and the general public who have no idea what exactly is going on. This is a story of Ron Kovic, an all-American kid from Long Island. He is full of passion for his country and he believes in serving his country, not caring whether he dies in the process. He eagerly enrolls in the Marine Corp and before he knows it, he is sent to Vietnam fighting in the front line. Some things happen there that leaves a huge impact on Ron and also he was paralyzed from a battle with the communists. He finds himself in a hospital and they have to amputate his legs. He then returns home to find that not everyone sees eye to eye on the war situation in Vietnam, many look at him with embarassment and repulse. In an instant, he had gone from hero to zero.

What really grabbed me about this movie was the story. It doesn't show the war in detail, but more what the war does to it's soldiers and the people involved. It's amazing how they show things from an individual's point of view. It shows the terrible effects of war that you just cannot watch on CNN. Through this movie, it opened my eyes that wars do not just leave towns/cities in destruction or leave people killed...it also effects the people who survived. The trauma and the pain they go through. It's hard to just pick up where you left. And yeah, everyone will be there when things are going well, but who'll be left when things go awry? When you lose your legs and need nursing?

I have to say, kudos to Cruise for giving an Oscar-worthy performance. I honestly felt he deserved the statuette for this role. It's hard to imagine anyone else pulling of the part as perfectly as he did. From humble and innocent beginnings, to a torn and desperate man left scarred for life. You can feel the emotion he's going through all the way. It's not hard to imagine yourself doing the same if you were in his shoes. This role defined Tom Cruise as an actor, and he has definitely earned a place in my book as one of the best actors around. The movie also has a slew of talented actors but most appear in brief sequences but due to Cruise's brilliant performance, it doesn't really matter.

Oliver Stone is one of the great directors of our time (other than Alexander) so his direction of this movie is no surprise, it's practically flawless. He does it so well, each scene is classic and invokes emotion that movies rarely create. And the score of the movie by John Williams is also fantastic. The music that appears in the parade earlier on in the movie, when the war veterans are marching by with broken legs and arms...kinda like a preview of things to come, brilliant!

This movie will be remembered for a long time and it really makes you sad that wars are still going on around the world. You wish that those people could watch movies like this and realize that it destroys something more than nations or buildings, it destroys the very essence of life. To quote from Ron Kovic, ""People say that if you don't love America, then get the hell out. Well, I love America"". If you haven't watched this movie, you are missing something important in American cinema.",1113696000,6,3628,4.368888888888889
2121163,4,B0002V7ON8,"When you see a war veteran campaigning against the very war in which he was willing to die once, you begin to have second thoughts about the intent behind the war. Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US's offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war, the question will haunt USA forever -was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences, but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.

Oliver Stone's Born on Fourth of July - based on the true story of Ron Kovic - takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon, injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital, his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence, not for the first time though.

Over next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece, the character of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance) goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will ""love him now"", that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology, that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans, that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army, the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam, the reality that he would not be able to father a child, the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war - it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus `ended' the patriotic fervor of a driven person, but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.

Born on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic, but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran's. At the end, there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain, trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not - the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK's historical urge - Ask not what your country can do for you, See what you can do for your country - only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty - the human spirit. The pangs of this reality hurt, just does as their own reality.",1108944000,8,2736,4.523232323232323

For a century films have confused the conscience of our times by celebrating the people who have pretended to do things more than the people who have actually done them. This may be a great film and Tom Cruise may prove once again that he is good at his job but he pulls us into an ethical quagmire while doing so.
