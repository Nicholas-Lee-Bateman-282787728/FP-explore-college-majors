Dolphina is of course gorgeous but who knew she was so funny as well?  As a fairly conservative person, I hesitated at buying this (felt a little silly...), but I was glad I did. I don't know that it is much of a physical workout but I did not buy it for that reason. It gave me a needed attitude adjustment so it was well worth the price.

I have been seeing Dita von Teese all over the news and am so excited that here is a DVD that teaches all her moves. Amazon wrote me the reminder email to send a review and I am so glad they did. I saw the other reviews about this dvd and I have to set the record straight: this is an AMAZING CARDIO WORKOUT!! I can't imagine that the people that said that it wasn't a workout even did the dvd! I begin to get warm during the first few sections: struts, grinds, bumps - feeling sculpting and a bit of a burn when we go into plie during some of the bumps. Then it goes into full cardio with shimmies & kicks & the routine. I can't imagine anyone not getting their heart rate going in these sections!! She teaches four different kinds of shimmies - and though I haven't mastered the milkshake yet, it is fun to try! During the kicks section, she teaches Rockette- style kicks that make me out of breath!! As for the reviews that wanted bellydance...Dolphina says Burlesque originated from bellydance, but no where does this say it is a bellydance dvd...so what are they talking about?? In my opinion...this is a great dvd, providing a terrific workout, fun new moves I have never seen anywhere else and I feel that my attitude has changed when I finish...I am happy and light-hearted.",1202688000,25,1449,4.37037037037037

And she's so inspirational! Not only is she drop-dead gorgeous and have an incredible body, she's obviously having fun while dancing. I felt more toned after doing it only once! I had a goddess party and invited five friends over to do it with me. Out of all the striptease dvd's, this was our favorite. We got the best workout and had the most fun.

Dolphina has plenty of other DVDs, if you want a BELLYDANCE DVD, buy one of her others. This is a burlesque DVD. Now with that said, I wasn't very fond of it. The music wasn't really catchy or interesting enough to make me want to get up and dance. Not only that but I feel like an idiot trying these moves myself. I much prefer her bellydance DVDs. I can't really see doing any of these moves in front of another human being. Unless you're a 1920s pin-up girl, the moves look ridiculous when you do them. They aren't sexy, and Dolphina looks more like she's focused on executing perfect moves than engaging an audience. .",1202256000,8,717,4.4393939393939394
2992374,1,B000WVPXC2,"This was a complete waste of money. I'm not sure I would call her a belly dancer based on this dvd. She doesn't look like she knows what she's doing. Her performance is a joke. If you want to see a real performance... look for any videos by Darshan. I think she's a great performer and her moves will hypnotize you.

You don't actually learn much of anything from this DVD either - I was pretty disappointed. I felt like an idiot doing some of the stuff too. The instructor isn't very good at cueing although she is at least pleasant.

2992377,3,B000WVPXC2,"Ok, this is not the most exciting workout in the world. If you're looking for intense cardio then you should choose another dvd. However, if you are looking for something fun to do in your days off between more intense workouts then give this dvd a shot. Like another reviewer said, the dvds pace is slow but it is a lot of fun and you will probably feel a bit silly at times (the boa segment could go, in my opinion).",1326412800,,418,4.172839506172839

2992379,4,B000WVPXC2,"I bought this hoping to give my workouts a change and it has been that.  Makes the working out fun and gives very good instruction with the moves.

2992380,3,B000WVPXC2,"It's not a bad DVD, if you're looking for something to get you out of your TV-hypnosis, but I wouldn't dare take this seriously as a workout. It's cutesy and has moments that work you pretty well, but overall it's just an ego boost.",1286323200,,232,4.295454545454546
2992381,3,B000WVPXC2,"I was really excited when I received The Goddess Workout DVD in the mail. I have only recently developed an interest in burlesque, and I find the instructional DVDs too advanced to keep up with. Wanting something that would count and exercise and still teach me some moves, I thought this would be the perfect solution. I was pretty disappointed. The workout is mediocre at best. I am overweight and very new to exercising, and I was only slightly winded during the kicks (which are definitely the most intense part). I did the entire thing (40 minutes) and definitely didn't feel like I had just exercised for 40 minutes. I cracked some smiles, but I didn't break a sweat. My days are pretty busy, so that was a huge negative for me. I really feel like I wasted time on this.

Pros:
Learned a few burlesque moves
Dolphina was hilarious
Definitely increased my sass for the day
Would be VERY fun in a group. I can just imagine having a girl's night in and putting this on. So much fun.

Cons:
Awful music
Not a good workout
The performance in the end was just a tease, I wanted to learn that stuff!
The cool-down came after her performance, not that I needed one.

All in all, I will keep this around for days when I'm not feeling up to a full blown workout. It did get me moving, but I just wanted more from it.",1285632000,2,1312,4.346938775510204
2992382,1,B000WVPXC2,Luckily I borrowed this Dvd from the Library. Its dull and it doesnt bring up your heart rate. I believe this dvd is just to show you the basics of Burlesque. It is definitely not a workout. Do not waste your money on it.,1281571200,2,221,4.045454545454546
2992383,3,B000WVPXC2,"I bought this dvd because I thought it would be a cool work out video.  It was cool, but it is not a work out at all.  It's more of an instructinal video, but only teaches some parts of burlesque- certain moves.  Dolphina is funny and makes the video entertaining, BUT if you're looking for an exercise video, don't get this one!",1277596800,,329,4.274193548387097
2992384,4,B000WVPXC2,"I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase this DVD because it seemed so typical and classical burlesque like, but after looking at the website I decided to purchase it anyway and I am glad that I did. I was surprisingly impressed by the format and quality. The moves are very basic but easily explained, with cute names to remember them by. The moves are easy to follow and will help add spice to any routines you may want to create on your own.

I come from more of a Rock N Roll and Neo dance background so I found this DVD to be very founded on classic and basic burlesque but if you are a beginner looking for a place to start or just wanting to dabble a bit I would recommend it! If you want more of a less classic and cheeky approach, check out Princess Farhanna and Jo Weldon's videos...but if you want to learn as much as you can...I'd say snag all three!

Yes, her end routine does show moves not covered in the DVD but in her defense I believe she was just showing what you can do once you have mastered the basic moves.

However this DVD is not a serious work out, you will burn some calories yes, and being active and moving is always a plus but if you want a more intense workout where you drip sweat stick to the gym weights and machines!",1270339200,,1252,4.122950819672131
2992385,4,B000WVPXC2,Dolphina is silly but this is a fun workout. I really didn't think about using any of these moves in a burlesque routine until I did the workout. It gives my husband a good laugh to watch me dancing around to this video.,1254873600,3,220,4.1395348837209305
2992386,3,B000WVPXC2,"I tried this DVD for the first time today, and thought it was alright.  Let me just go over the pros and cons...

Pros:
-I love dance-oriented exercise, so this was fun for me.  She teaches a lot of basic burlesque moves, and it didn't feel like I was working out.  As another reviewer stated, you aren't watching the clock while doing this.
-It's easy to follow.  For those of you who don't have a background in dance, you should still be able to follow along with all the moves.  She does a good job explaining everything.

Cons:
-It's not a great cardio workout.  I felt my heart rate elevate a little during the Shimmies and Kicks sections, but other than that, it was mostly a workout for your hips and abs, a little bit of arms at times.  It may give a better workout for someone just starting to exercise, but I'm already in fairly good shape.  Therefore, this will be a DVD I use on the days I don't feel like working out, but know that I should, because it's definitely better than nothing.
-Dolphina is very cheesy, in my opinion.  I found I had to kind of tune out her comments and just focus on the moves otherwise it would have annoyed me quite a bit.
-The cool down.  First of all, after doing the Routine where she puts all the moves together, it then cuts to her bonus performance.  This is not a part in which you're supposed to follow the moves, it's just her showing off.  Why they put this at the end of the workout instead of just keeping it in the special features, I don't know.  So, you have to wait for about three minutes of doing nothing before you get to the cool down.  What's annoying about the actual cool down is she uses huge feather fans.  A boa is pretty readily available to people, but giant feather fans?  Not so much.  It just would have been nice if she'd made it so the viewer could do exactly what she was doing.

So if you're in the market for a fun dance exercise DVD, and you're a beginner with exercise, this will be good, as long as Dolphina's cheesiness doesn't bug you.",1241395200,2,2018,4.260526315789473
2992387,4,B000WVPXC2,"I'm torn on this DVD. You have to know what you're getting your self into. It's good for a core workout, as it works your midsection and hips. I don't think it should be considered a cardio workout though. It is easy to follow, which is nice. This DVD could definitely be used by beginners (as I am one). I would use this in conjunction with your regular work out.
The music. VERY slow and bland. Dolphia can be annoying with her pronunciations and performance. I gave it 4/5 for the fact that I would use this again. Just to work the core muscles and midsection.",1241049600,,563,4.320754716981132
2992388,4,B000WVPXC2,"This is a fun workout! There are parts where you aren't moving enough to get your heartrate up, but other times you are shaking your stuff so hard your heart starts pounding. Dolphina does a good job of encouraging you to let your inner sexy come out, and while you won't be a burlesque expert when your done you will learn some moves that will have you feeling sexy. Her cute comments like calling your arms and hand ""diamond recepticles"" will have you smiling. Maybe this isn't the dvd for you if you are in good physical condition looking for an intense cardio workout, but if you are like me and are trying to get rid of the extra pounds while having fun, and maybe need to feel a little sexy once in a while then you will enjoy this DVD. I found it made me feel more sexy than the other striptease dance dvd's I've tried.",1233705600,2,826,4.267515923566879
2992389,5,B000WVPXC2,"Did this workout last night for the first time. It was so much fun, way more than I anticipated. Dolphina cracked me up with her over-the-top ""sex kitten"" comments and attitude - in a good way - not one that made me cringe. To be honest, her comments, such as ""be a brat!"" ""say NO! I will NOT do that!"" ""I want diamonds!"" etc., actually helped me perform the moves with attitude, walk the walk, and *not* feel silly. I was grinning ear to ear the whole time. I also loved the music!

The best part is that I never got bored, watched the clock, or wanted to stop, which is always my biggest problem. I was actually sad when it was over (40ish minutes, I think?) The worst part is that it's not really much of a workout. It will get your heart mildly elevated, but it's not going to take the place of step class or lunges. That being said, getting up, moving around, feeling saucy and having fun is way, way better for one than sitting on the couch or surfing the net, which is what I usually end up doing because I'm fighting working out. I will definitely be doing this one again.

Oh, almost forgot. I tried this workout in the back room of my house, while my boyfriend and one of his colleagues were working on their laptops in the living room. Apparently, the ""shadows"" of me working out were being projected out of the room and onto the hallway wall, which I didn't realize was visible from the living room couch. When I was finished, I walked out into the living room and both guys looked up with big grins. My boyfriend said, ""I don't know what was going on in there, but YES!"" :)",1233187200,,1586,4.248344370860927
2992390,4,B000WVPXC2,"I was a little worried about getting this dvd after soom of the reviews but I am glad that I did. While my lower back & knees are a little too tender right now to make it through the whole thing, I do what I can. I can't wait until I'm healthy enough to do it from start to finish because this is such a fun workout. Dolphina's moves & tongue-in-cheek commentary keep you smiling while you work out. This isn't a hard-core workout, but it's one that targets your tummy, hips, & thighs.",1231545600,2,485,4.170212765957447
2992391,5,B000WVPXC2,"I read the reviews and saw it was mixed for this product. I didn't order it thinking it would be like a big workout, but I just wanted to add some fun to my cardio. It is really a fun DVD. You do get some kinda workout, but I add it to my cardio and think it helps a little. I just wanted to learn how to do some of the moves and I think it is great. I want to get my girlfriends together so we can all learn the moves. It is a great tease dance. If you are looking to just add some fun then this is a great DVD. It isn't made for a heavy workout, but rather just a twist in a light workout.",1225584000,,591,3.5891472868217056
2992392,5,B000WVPXC2,"Dolphina Belly Dance is a great series for women who want to get a good and fun cardio work out.  Dolphina's focus and goal is to help all women enjoy themselves for who they are and what their bodies have to offer.  While the work out is focusing on your physical appearance, hips, buns, thighs, and abs, Dolphina adds a special introspective view to strengthen the mind and spirit as well.  This particular video also adds a little spicey flare that you may find useful in your life.  I highly recommend Dolphina to any woman looking for a fun, exciting way to refresh their daily routine.",1225584000,,591,4.547169811320755
2992393,2,B000WVPXC2,"I probably should have read the reviews on this DVD before purchasing it. I do a lot of dancing and have a collection of work outs on DVD. This is one I wish I could return. I didn't break a sweat unfortunately. The actual performance the instructor gives is pretty bad. It's like she wasn't even listening to the music or going to a beat of any kind. It was cute, but definitely not sexy. This DVD would probably be more appropriate for someone who doesn't know how to dance at all.",1216598400,,483,4.260869565217392

2992395,2,B000WVPXC2,"On the positive side, Dolphina is fun, upbeat, and playful.

On the negative side...

The DVD is sleep-inducing. The pace is very slow, she speaks slowly and softly, and the jazzy ""burlesque"" music in the background makes elevator music sound like heavy metal.

There's no actual ""workout"" here, either. The DVD is divided into topics, like  ""struts,"" ""bumps,"" ""grinds, ""kicks,"" ""shimmies,"" etc., and she demonstrates each in an equally slow, methodical way. The only chapter that might get your heart rate up is the kicks, but that's just a few minutes. Dolphina also covers the topic ""Boa,"" and the cool-down utilizes big feather fans. (Likely you don't have those handy or could pick them up at your local Sports Authority.)

There's a segment called ""Routine"" that puts most of the moves together, but again, it's very low-impact and slow-paced, so unless you're grievously out of shape, don't expect your heart rate to budge.

It was all fun stuff and easy to do, but the one part I found grating was the segment called ""Performance,"" where she indulges herself with an overly-long burlesque routine that uses a lot of moves not shown in the instructional segments. (Even if it did, the camera cuts make it almost impossible to follow or imitate.) Nice for the hubby, but I could do very well without it.

All in all, it was surprisingly dull, pedestrian, and a bit self-indulgent. I really wanted to like it, which made my disappointment that much greater.",1209686400,19,1462,4.894736842105263
2992396,2,B000WVPXC2,"I just got this on DVD today and watched some of it.  It is okay, but Dolphina is irritating!  Her little attitude sermons make me want to rip every hair out of her head.  She reminds me of some airheaded, rich, snot nosed brat at certain points in the DVD.  I'll have to try to workout to this DVD and see if it's worth my time.  Personally, I like The S Factor series with Sheila Kelley and Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip series much better. If you want a sensual moves and a workout that works, go with the S Factor.  I've gotten the most developed core and thighs by using that workout and my flexibility has increased as well.",1207958400,2,630,4.208333333333333

They aren't sexy, and Dolphina looks more like she's focused on executing perfect moves than engaging an audience. .",1202256000,8,717,4.4393939393939394

3226878,3,B000WVPXC2,"I was really excited when I received The Goddess Workout DVD in the mail. I have only recently developed an interest in burlesque, and I find the instructional DVDs too advanced to keep up with. Wanting something that would count and exercise and still teach me some moves, I thought this would be the perfect solution. I was pretty disappointed. The workout is mediocre at best. I am overweight and very new to exercising, and I was only slightly winded during the kicks (which are definitely the most intense part). I did the entire thing (40 minutes) and definitely didn't feel like I had just exercised for 40 minutes. I cracked some smiles, but I didn't break a sweat. My days are pretty busy, so that was a huge negative for me. I really feel like I wasted time on this.

Pros:
Learned a few burlesque moves
Dolphina was hilarious
Definitely increased my sass for the day
Would be VERY fun in a group. I can just imagine having a girl's night in and putting this on. So much fun.

Cons:
Awful music
Not a good workout
The performance in the end was just a tease, I wanted to learn that stuff!
The cool-down came after her performance, not that I needed one.

All in all, I will keep this around for days when I'm not feeling up to a full blown workout. It did get me moving, but I just wanted more from it.",1285632000,2,1312,4.346938775510204
3226879,1,B000WVPXC2,Luckily I borrowed this Dvd from the Library. Its dull and it doesnt bring up your heart rate. I believe this dvd is just to show you the basics of Burlesque. It is definitely not a workout. Do not waste your money on it.,1281571200,2,221,4.045454545454546
3226880,3,B000WVPXC2,"I bought this dvd because I thought it would be a cool work out video.  It was cool, but it is not a work out at all.  It's more of an instructinal video, but only teaches some parts of burlesque- certain moves.  Dolphina is funny and makes the video entertaining, BUT if you're looking for an exercise video, don't get this one!",1277596800,,329,4.274193548387097
3226881,4,B000WVPXC2,"I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase this DVD because it seemed so typical and classical burlesque like, but after looking at the website I decided to purchase it anyway and I am glad that I did. I was surprisingly impressed by the format and quality. The moves are very basic but easily explained, with cute names to remember them by. The moves are easy to follow and will help add spice to any routines you may want to create on your own.

I come from more of a Rock N Roll and Neo dance background so I found this DVD to be very founded on classic and basic burlesque but if you are a beginner looking for a place to start or just wanting to dabble a bit I would recommend it! If you want more of a less classic and cheeky approach, check out Princess Farhanna and Jo Weldon's videos...but if you want to learn as much as you can...I'd say snag all three!

Yes, her end routine does show moves not covered in the DVD but in her defense I believe she was just showing what you can do once you have mastered the basic moves.

However this DVD is not a serious work out, you will burn some calories yes, and being active and moving is always a plus but if you want a more intense workout where you drip sweat stick to the gym weights and machines!",1270339200,,1252,4.122950819672131
3226882,4,B000WVPXC2,Dolphina is silly but this is a fun workout. I really didn't think about using any of these moves in a burlesque routine until I did the workout. It gives my husband a good laugh to watch me dancing around to this video.,1254873600,3,220,4.1395348837209305
3226883,3,B000WVPXC2,"I tried this DVD for the first time today, and thought it was alright.  Let me just go over the pros and cons...

Pros:
-I love dance-oriented exercise, so this was fun for me.  She teaches a lot of basic burlesque moves, and it didn't feel like I was working out.  As another reviewer stated, you aren't watching the clock while doing this.
-It's easy to follow.  For those of you who don't have a background in dance, you should still be able to follow along with all the moves.  She does a good job explaining everything.

Cons:
-It's not a great cardio workout.  I felt my heart rate elevate a little during the Shimmies and Kicks sections, but other than that, it was mostly a workout for your hips and abs, a little bit of arms at times.  It may give a better workout for someone just starting to exercise, but I'm already in fairly good shape.  Therefore, this will be a DVD I use on the days I don't feel like working out, but know that I should, because it's definitely better than nothing.
-Dolphina is very cheesy, in my opinion.  I found I had to kind of tune out her comments and just focus on the moves otherwise it would have annoyed me quite a bit.
-The cool down.  First of all, after doing the Routine where she puts all the moves together, it then cuts to her bonus performance.  This is not a part in which you're supposed to follow the moves, it's just her showing off.  Why they put this at the end of the workout instead of just keeping it in the special features, I don't know.  So, you have to wait for about three minutes of doing nothing before you get to the cool down.  What's annoying about the actual cool down is she uses huge feather fans.  A boa is pretty readily available to people, but giant feather fans?  Not so much.  It just would have been nice if she'd made it so the viewer could do exactly what she was doing.

So if you're in the market for a fun dance exercise DVD, and you're a beginner with exercise, this will be good, as long as Dolphina's cheesiness doesn't bug you.",1241395200,2,2018,4.260526315789473
3226884,4,B000WVPXC2,"I'm torn on this DVD. You have to know what you're getting your self into. It's good for a core workout, as it works your midsection and hips. I don't think it should be considered a cardio workout though. It is easy to follow, which is nice. This DVD could definitely be used by beginners (as I am one). I would use this in conjunction with your regular work out.
The music. VERY slow and bland. Dolphia can be annoying with her pronunciations and performance. I gave it 4/5 for the fact that I would use this again. Just to work the core muscles and midsection.",1241049600,,563,4.320754716981132
3226885,4,B000WVPXC2,"This is a fun workout! There are parts where you aren't moving enough to get your heartrate up, but other times you are shaking your stuff so hard your heart starts pounding. Dolphina does a good job of encouraging you to let your inner sexy come out, and while you won't be a burlesque expert when your done you will learn some moves that will have you feeling sexy. Her cute comments like calling your arms and hand ""diamond recepticles"" will have you smiling. Maybe this isn't the dvd for you if you are in good physical condition looking for an intense cardio workout, but if you are like me and are trying to get rid of the extra pounds while having fun, and maybe need to feel a little sexy once in a while then you will enjoy this DVD. I found it made me feel more sexy than the other striptease dance dvd's I've tried.",1233705600,2,826,4.267515923566879
3226886,5,B000WVPXC2,"Did this workout last night for the first time. It was so much fun, way more than I anticipated. Dolphina cracked me up with her over-the-top ""sex kitten"" comments and attitude - in a good way - not one that made me cringe. To be honest, her comments, such as ""be a brat!"" ""say NO! I will NOT do that!"" ""I want diamonds!"" etc., actually helped me perform the moves with attitude, walk the walk, and *not* feel silly. I was grinning ear to ear the whole time. I also loved the music!

The best part is that I never got bored, watched the clock, or wanted to stop, which is always my biggest problem. I was actually sad when it was over (40ish minutes, I think?) The worst part is that it's not really much of a workout. It will get your heart mildly elevated, but it's not going to take the place of step class or lunges. That being said, getting up, moving around, feeling saucy and having fun is way, way better for one than sitting on the couch or surfing the net, which is what I usually end up doing because I'm fighting working out. I will definitely be doing this one again.

Oh, almost forgot. I tried this workout in the back room of my house, while my boyfriend and one of his colleagues were working on their laptops in the living room. Apparently, the ""shadows"" of me working out were being projected out of the room and onto the hallway wall, which I didn't realize was visible from the living room couch. When I was finished, I walked out into the living room and both guys looked up with big grins. My boyfriend said, ""I don't know what was going on in there, but YES!"" :)",1233187200,,1586,4.248344370860927

I can't wait until I'm healthy enough to do it from start to finish because this is such a fun workout. Dolphina's moves & tongue-in-cheek commentary keep you smiling while you work out. This isn't a hard-core workout, but it's one that targets your tummy, hips, & thighs.",1231545600,2,485,4.170212765957447

I want to get my girlfriends together so we can all learn the moves. It is a great tease dance. If you are looking to just add some fun then this is a great DVD.

Dolphina's focus and goal is to help all women enjoy themselves for who they are and what their bodies have to offer.  While the work out is focusing on your physical appearance, hips, buns, thighs, and abs, Dolphina adds a special introspective view to strengthen the mind and spirit as well.  This particular video also adds a little spicey flare that you may find useful in your life.

3226892,2,B000WVPXC2,"On the positive side, Dolphina is fun, upbeat, and playful.

On the negative side...

The DVD is sleep-inducing. The pace is very slow, she speaks slowly and softly, and the jazzy ""burlesque"" music in the background makes elevator music sound like heavy metal.

There's no actual ""workout"" here, either. The DVD is divided into topics, like  ""struts,"" ""bumps,"" ""grinds, ""kicks,"" ""shimmies,"" etc., and she demonstrates each in an equally slow, methodical way. The only chapter that might get your heart rate up is the kicks, but that's just a few minutes. Dolphina also covers the topic ""Boa,"" and the cool-down utilizes big feather fans. (Likely you don't have those handy or could pick them up at your local Sports Authority.)

There's a segment called ""Routine"" that puts most of the moves together, but again, it's very low-impact and slow-paced, so unless you're grievously out of shape, don't expect your heart rate to budge.

It was all fun stuff and easy to do, but the one part I found grating was the segment called ""Performance,"" where she indulges herself with an overly-long burlesque routine that uses a lot of moves not shown in the instructional segments. (Even if it did, the camera cuts make it almost impossible to follow or imitate.) Nice for the hubby, but I could do very well without it.

All in all, it was surprisingly dull, pedestrian, and a bit self-indulgent. I really wanted to like it, which made my disappointment that much greater.",1209686400,19,1462,4.894736842105263
3226893,2,B000WVPXC2,"I just got this on DVD today and watched some of it.  It is okay, but Dolphina is irritating!  Her little attitude sermons make me want to rip every hair out of her head.  She reminds me of some airheaded, rich, snot nosed brat at certain points in the DVD.  I'll have to try to workout to this DVD and see if it's worth my time.  Personally, I like The S Factor series with Sheila Kelley and Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip series much better. If you want a sensual moves and a workout that works, go with the S Factor.  I've gotten the most developed core and thighs by using that workout and my flexibility has increased as well.",1207958400,2,630,4.208333333333333

I saw the other reviews about this dvd and I have to set the record straight: this is an AMAZING CARDIO WORKOUT!! I can't imagine that the people that said that it wasn't a workout even did the dvd! I begin to get warm during the first few sections: struts, grinds, bumps - feeling sculpting and a bit of a burn when we go into plie during some of the bumps. Then it goes into full cardio with shimmies & kicks & the routine. I can't imagine anyone not getting their heart rate going in these sections!! She teaches four different kinds of shimmies - and though I haven't mastered the milkshake yet, it is fun to try! During the kicks section, she teaches Rockette- style kicks that make me out of breath!!  In my opinion...this is a great dvd, providing a terrific workout, fun new moves I have never seen anywhere else and I feel that my attitude has changed when I finish...I am happy and light-hearted.",1480982400,2,1074,4.365

This DVD is worth the 7 dollars if you enjoy different dance techniques or instruction. I however would not pay more than that for it. Also try Carmen Electras DVDs because she does lots of reps and focuses on teaching streching and proper form plus she is gorgeous and doesnt take herself too seriously.

Dolphina is a true California Barbie doll and while she is not the world' greatest dancer, she is a fun instructor to watch and dance with.  She's very cute and makes little jokes, although sometimes you feel cheesy doing some of the moves (I only did about 2 of the dozen butt-smacks in the routine).  I gave her points off for calling this a ""cardio workout""--it is not, you will not likely break a sweat unless you are seriously out of shape or you are standing next to a woodstove like me.  There really is only about 40 minutes of dancing and throwing in a second routine or more combinations would've been nice.  Don't expect to come away with a choreography at the end, she mostly teaches you basic moves and gives stylistic points (I liked the bonus lingerie 101 section).
