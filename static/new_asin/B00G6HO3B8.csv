6061587,5,B00G6HO3B8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. The write-up made it sound pretty lame, but it had pretty much everything I look for in a film:
1. Hot babes - the three main characters were all very easy on the eyes
2. Action - quite a bit of it, and it didn't all look as badly staged as most action films do
3. A plot or some semblance thereof - OK Shakespeare it's not, but the quirky characters do odd things that offer a few surprises
4. Believability -  OK, not terribly believable, but 1 and 2 above go a long way toward quelling my disbelief

The acting was solid throughout, the characters were consistent and, as I mentioned, quirky, which I enjoy. The cinematography was solid, bordering on the artsy at times but not  getting carried away with it, like the crap that Hollywood types worship.",1404432000,7,797,4.408163265306122
6061588,3,B00G6HO3B8,"It had a lot of action and foreseeable twists. But, the plot is full of ditsy moments. I did enjoy it though.",1400198400,,109,4.0

6061590,3,B00G6HO3B8,"CB for short was a quirky with a dash of cheese story that centers on three roommates with one (Sammi, Diora Baird) being a much need source of revenue to help the lesbian couple (Kris, Carly Pope and Tara, Samaire Armstro) make ends meet.
One night the carefree Tara and the silly and crazy Sammi went looking for a rave and stumbled upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong that left everyone dead and a bag full of money for the taking.
Without giving to much away the three girls plus Sammi's boyfriend (Karl, Brian Smith) are having trust/secret issues with one another and is at the center of the story with the other exception being Kris and her smarts, steady nerve and other talents. The sub plot involves Karl's loan shark (Kostas, John Rhys-Davies) and his infusion into the money/story.
The production values are quite good for a movie in this budget range that includes cinematography, some acting, choreographed fight scene, lighting, makeup, blood work, costumes and image quality.
The story is told through titled chapters that tell part of the story then go back and retell and complete the chapter (this was irritating to me the way this story was presented) and bind the two segments together. It is filled with many twists and turns that are pretty transparent and at time overly redundant and played out.
Kris is the only character with brains in the story and the rest were just a bunch of half-wits that I had little compassion for and like the twists and turns were overplayed and became irritating.
The story is fun at times and quirky the cast do a decent job with their acting, but the clumsy/dumb Karl and over abundance of half-witted cast members didn't add any much needed comic relief to the story for me. The director and or writer didn't seemed to be able to pull off the comedic side to this story as well as it needed to be. The attractive young cast are easy on the eyes and add a little extra to the story as does seeing many character actors I've enjoyed over the years lending a hand on this lower budgeted movie.
The movie has a decent amount of violence including shootings, fights and some torture as well as a good amount of blood. There is mention of drug use and sale the of hash and a night of dringing. The language at times is like boys huddled around a porn mag with an abundance of the Fword flying fast and furious. There is one scene that shows the nude full back of of two of the young ladies.
This movie was worth the time to watch and with some rework could be a real treat to see again.
The movie squeaks in at just under 3 stars, but I'll give it 3 for what it does get right.",1399161600,,2638,4.4300411522633745
6061591,5,B00G6HO3B8,"Good action, lots of goofy comedy and one liners.  The story was more developed than I expected.  Fans of Tarantino or similar works would probably enjoy this one.  It is not a hard line serious film, so don't look for ""deep, underlying social significance"", because that is not what it is meant to be about!",1398384000,6,308,4.5636363636363635
6061592,3,B00G6HO3B8,"Three women share an apartment. Kris (Carly Pope) prepares taxes and is the brains in the group. She is also less impulsive than her roommates. She has secret past. Her girlfriend is Tara (Samaire Armstrong). She is almost child like in her reasoning abilities. Sammi (Diora Baird) is the third wheel. She has a boyfriend Karl (Brian Smith) but unknown to Kris, she sometimes comes on to Tara.

The film introduces the quirky characters in a way to make you think this is a comedy or dark comedy. When Sammi and Tara find a bag of money, this sets the wheels in motion. The film has Tarantino style flashbacks. Some of the flashbacks were meaningful and added to the film while others appeared for the sake of having a flashback.

I liked the plot. The flashbacks were okay. The characters were good. The dialog needed some tweaking. It also needed a few more good scenes. Unfortunately the good scenes were in the flashbacks and we already knew the final outcome. The drug deal gone bad had no set up and didn't tie into the plot outside of the money. They could have used the drug dealing painter from the first scene as part of that group.

This is Nicholas Kalikow first attempt at writer and director.  Not bad for a first attempt. People who like this type of film I would recommend ""Violet and Daisy.""

6061611,2,B00G6HO3B8,"Concrete Blondes, 2012 film

It begins with a couple explaining their income tax deduction! Can they pay with goods instead of cash? The tax preparer leaves for home by bus. She meets her roommates. [Are they too weird and unbelievable?] The next morning she finds a man in her kitchen. Then a deal is made, she goes to a restaurant. Was she cheated? [No, she got what she expected.] She pays her landlord in cash. [But she doesnt get a receipt!] Later her friends return with a big bag of loonies (Canadian dollars). There is a gun in the bag. What do they do next? They hide it in a rented garage. Later they show what happened when they get that money. Will that money bring happiness?

They can exchange Canadian money with a $3,000 limit. [Actually, anything over that limit has to be reported to the Federal Government.] We learn more about the two women. They go to a club. One girls boyfriend talks about that deal. Intruders invade their apartment! But that gun stops them. A mop will clean up the blood1 Carl learns about the money. There is a sensational scene. Carl uses bolt cutters to break into that garage. But its gone! Somebody stole it first! Sammi and Tara worry about their friends past. Chris took the money, she explains how. They must pack and leave since people know where they live.

We learn how Carl hurt his hand, and how those two men went to the apartment. Then he sees the girls carrying a large bundle into a station wagon. He follows them to watch them burying that bundle. The girls try to disguise their appearances, share the money, and split. There is a disagreement over this. Carl asks for all the money, he has a videotape of their activities. They go to the meeting. But there are intruders! Can the boss sort it out? Or take a simplifying action? There are shots fired! Bodies fall. The boss finds Carl. The girls fight back with George. The boss wants to leave with the money. Tara leaves Chris, who goes to Mexico with the money. She is questioned by a policeman. Is everything OK now? There is a big surprise at the end.

This is a confused story with few redeeming features. But you may disagree. The limited scenes show its low budget production, but I object to the story. It reminds me of a classic movie like The Asphalt Jungle with a modified ending. I don't recommend it, but it has some interesting features in its story. One lesson is to avoid people like those shown in this movie.",1459900800,,2437,4.481981981981982

6061626,5,B00G6HO3B8,"I was in a John Rhys-Davies mood, and found ""Concrete Blondes"" by searching Amazon Prime Video for his name.  When this one came up, I thought, ""What the heck is a great actor like John Rhys-Davies doing in a jiggle flick named 'Concrete Blondes'?""

The answer:  He was showing his abilities as a great actor and obviously having a fun time doing it!  To my surprise, John Rhys-Davies plays a major supporting role in the story.

This dark comedy is very reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction.""  It has implausibly dumb characters, drug dealers, huge piles of money, and messy shootings to deal with.  We don't get John Travolta dancing, but we do get an innovative presentation of the story, first from one character's point of view, and then rewind to show the rest of the story from another's point of view.  Brilliantly conceived and nicely executed.  The ending is bittersweet, but probably the best I would have hoped for.

Production values are excellent; good lighting, Foley work, editing, and all the rest.  That big ol' arch leads me to think the setting is supposed to be Saint Louis, but the film was made in British Columbia.  (Vancouver, maybe?)  In any case, it's set in some major urban center, somewhere that they speak English, trade in hashish, and have a large, upscale Greek restaurant.  Were it not for the arch, I would have thought New York City; not that it really matters.",1442707200,3,1390,4.7375

Why would three U.S. gals with three million in hot Canadian cash want to run to Mexico with it? Why not just go to Canada? It was never even a consideration throughout the entire movie.
