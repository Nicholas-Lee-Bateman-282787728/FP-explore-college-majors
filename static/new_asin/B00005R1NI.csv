7951424,5,B00005R1NI,"Whether for private home use or for public teaching, ECHOES OF THE WHITE HOUSE is a sterling reincarnation of over 200 years of the history of the structure and inhabitants of the Presidential Mansion as told in the actual words of former Presidents, First Ladies,Servants and Visitors.

A-List actors such as Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest,Blythe Danner and more recreate the people and events that built and rebuilt the historic structure. Did you know that The White House was rebuilt/renovated four times? Andrew Jackson actually opened it to the public 24 hours a day! Truman saw the house nearly collapse when a ""big and grand"" servant walked across the sagging floor boards of The Oval Office! Coolidge built a solarium ushering in the first ""private space"" for the First Family.

Tony Award winning composer Michael Starobin has created  wonderful and gentle Americana melodies performed on guitar, piano and orchestra to underscore this 60 minute PBS video. Highly recommended for all ages.",1184630400,27,996,5.2125
