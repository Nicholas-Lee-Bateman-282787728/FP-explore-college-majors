The movie's ok, but it's not fair!!  Ranma should be the one proposing!  It's interesting, though, and i would reccomend it for Ryoga and Akane fans.",988416000,,322,4.8
1885681,4,B00009NH86,"Actually, I really like this video.  The second episode is hillarious, and is one of my favorites from ANY series.  Like the title says, however, it would be much better if there was more than two episodes to this tape.  Viz is supposed to be correcting this starting with season 6, making each video they release thereafter 3 episodes each.",982540800,,341,4.65
1885694,1,B00009NH86,"Don't buy this dvd, because this is not an original version. The only legal way to buy the live action is about to CDJapan or YesAsia. The original version are available on DVD and Blu-ray with extras, but they have no english subtitles.",1344124800,13,237,4.534883720930233
1885695,4,B00009NH86,"This is Ranma 1/2 without the extra fiance's we've come to love and adore.  There is no Shampoo, no Ukyo or Ryoga etc.  If you know the first few books you can see where they were going with this, people, places and events are changed around a bit because the characters who were part of the original story aren't involved.  Such as Kuno is responsible for Akane's hair being cut instead of Ryoga.  Also the characters personalities have been somewhat altered and don't react the way they would in the Manga or the Anime.

Considering this was a made for TV movie and not a higher budget live action film remake there is very little C.G. which would have been near impossible if they included all of our beloved and cursed crew.  However, even with their absence it is still worth seeing and I still enjoyed it for what it was.  If this had been bigger budget with a movie going audience in mind I don't doubt it would have been closer to Takahashi's original work, as it is though it is still cute.",1336867200,12,999,4.396739130434782
1885696,2,B00009NH86,"It's all about the storyboard crews that made Ranma 1/2 into what it was. They deserve a hand of applause for their work.

The whole story basically revolved around Ranma desiring to be the person he wants to be and not turn into or have a dark-side to blow up in his face to torment and hinder him and the relationships of those close to him. Not to mention having to deal with secrets and being under public eyes, in the end there was no direction for the future to imagine the possibilities. He's left feeling he must live quietly forever unresolved without the means to a balanced hemisphere or working lasting relationship to his environment.

But to some it all up, the end was just plain crap. Pure and simple, no opinionating or guessing to it, this is where logic steps in. Those with their opinions are entitled to them but get it straight, most do not like the very ending.

Some statements have to be said though, if a series or any series has lasted past 3-4 seasons a closing scene should been heavily thought out that peacefully puts the series to a permanent end. That should be the main idea for a long running series that made a huge profit, sort of as tribute to those base watchers who consecutively enjoyed watching that or any show for long periods, not a ego or a quota requirement that needs to be filled before any ending which is likely what happened here. As normal things go, ""No series"" ever comes right back.

A good ending should sometimes have help in creating when a desirable one can't be found. Ranma was left unsatisfied and incomplete in his life, his relationship went nowhere, he didn't break the curse, from a storyline perspective that would have been easy to resolve in a funny manner but it didn't happen. It takes imagination sure, we all have imagination but that ending was the worst for one for a story, any person worth two cents or more could have done far better on the storyboard plot to the whole ending without jeopardizing the dreaded sense of incompletion.

It's not a matter of opinion here; it's a matter of common sense. The ending is the easiest to conceive when making a story, stretching out the same old story year after year by the same storyboard writers is the hard part. Almost ant person can give a story a good ending, the cost of drawing then producing to get a cartoon out on set time is the real issue. But when a storyboard group can't see their show being cut off the air they won't give an adequate and appropriate ending especially on short notice. It's speculation, but writers are that way, cartoonists keep their jobs, but the storyboard people get moved or placed somewhere else if they are not dumped from theirs. But who knows what happened or why they made that particular ending with him and Ranma's mother.

In the end all we want is for just want a sense of finality to complete the show and scenes we watched and they came up short. That's it folks there is no more. If someone says there is more continuation to season 7 past episode 25 and that there is even a season 8 coming up, they are lying through their teeth unless they actually show you pictures from actual clips or sample movie clips.",1103932800,,3183,4.488773747841106
1885697,4,B00009NH86,"This Dvd takes place during the 20th volume(22nd japanese) were Ranma meets his mother. I have heard that at the end Ranma and Akane are going to school as they wave and say good bye, well that is the real manga ending, but they skipped a good 15 volumes!!  Kitty productions was actually making the anime as the manga came out and when they came to the whole Ranma mother saga they decided to end it there.  The Manga continued on with Ranma's mother later on and it got in alot better fights as well.  Including two returns of Pantyhouse Turo.  Also what to be considered the greatest oppent Ranma ever had: Herb of the Dusk Dynsty. The Manga ending was one of the best Anime/Manga endings to a series of all time, and any Ranma fan should read it.",1081814400,,750,4.335714285714285
1885698,3,B00009NH86,"When I saw the last episode, I was like, ""What?  That's it???""  I started getting depressed.  That was such a let down.  So, I've been spending nine years watching Ranma all for this?  I honestly was outraged.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Ranma, but they can't do this to us!  That was mean!  I just hope the manga turns out differently, at least has an ending.  Feh!",1065830400,3,374,4.228571428571429
1885699,5,B00009NH86,"Now first of all, I am the biggest Ranma 1/2 fan out there.  I have the first five season and OVAs, and the three movies.  I don't like you guys saying bad things about this dvd, even though I haven't seen the dvd.  So I don't know if it's all that good or bad, but I've read about it many times. Let's pray, and maybe when Rumiko Takahashi finishes the manga, they might actually make all the other stories animated and hopefully, a much more proper ending.  Also maybe introduce other characters, like Akari.",1063497600,,510,4.3936170212765955
1885700,3,B00009NH86,"Yes, after years, the final episodes of Ranma 1/2 are available here in the US. That doesn't mean this is where the author intended the series to end. These 4 episodes only bring you up to the point where Ranma meets his mother. This happens before the OAVs.",1063065600,,258,4.395833333333333
1885701,2,B00009NH86,"Being a die hard Ranma 1/2 fan i was excited to here that the last series was out. I was hoping that Ranma forever:some day some would be the best ending of an anime i've seen so far but sadly it was not. i mean not all the episodes where bad like ""a ninja's dog is black and white"",which was very good. Having Ryoga the everlost boy find a ninja dog in troble and saving the dogs life. They become best friends so the dog wants to help ryoga, so he delivers ryoga secret love letter to akane. The other episodes like ""the tendo dragon legend"" we get to see dr.tofu actuall fight,minus when kasume is near hem and when that happens bad thing happen. Also ""boy meets mom part 1,2"" you really get to see ranma life a child that no one really knows about. Also you see some love between ranma and akane, well not that much. The thing that i disliked the most was how they ended the long famous ranma series. It seemed like they made it up in one day and was very disappointing . The magna of Ranma go on and have a much better ending and was a lot better then the tv series. If you want to see or read a better ending of Ranma read the magna , i highly recommend vol 22 .",1062028800,3,1168,4.017167381974249

7991981,5,B00009NH86,"The movie itself is absolute fun for any fan of Rumiko Takahashi's work, and the DVD quality is fair for what it is. The subtitles are good but somewhat lag on my copy, but my experience with Japanese dramas is that the English subs are usually full of spelling and grammar errors, or completely nonsensical. These are easy to read and make sense, despite a few small grammar issues. They might be an issue for some people, but compared to other dramas I've bought in the past, they are well done. I definitely think the movie itself is worth purchasing if you're a fan of Ranma 1/2 or just enjoy Japanese dramas as a whole. It's funny, sweet and sentimental, but also has a lot of fun action! It's not exactly the same as the manga or anime, but it does a good job of translating that world into a real-life setting. I highly recommend giving it a try!",1456876800,,853,4.371069182389937

7991984,4,B00009NH86,This version of Ranma 1/2 was an interesting and entertaining video. It had its similarities with its source but also differences. I loved seeing the interactions between the characters and would love to see a sequel if it were ever made. The one down side was the costume they use  for panda Genma. It was obviously a costume. But for the budget of this film it was okay.,1408320000,,372,4.470588235294118
7991985,5,B00009NH86,"Although it makes some strange choices in what to keep and what to discard from the original manga and anime, and then adds a new plotline to create a stand-alone story, this live action adaptation was a lot of fun, with appealing performances and nice special effects that preserved the feeling of the original. The important characters survive the transition to live action unscathed, and the portrayal of Ranma-chan is particularly funny. It might be a good way to introduce new fans to Ranma 1/2 in particular, and Rumiko Takahashi in general.",1368316800,2,547,4.956521739130435
7991986,5,B00009NH86,I have always loved the Ranma 1/2 anime and I could not believe that there was a live action movie.  Fast paced fun!,1357776000,,116,4.043478260869565
7991987,5,B00009NH86,"First, I love Ramna 1/2, the TV series and the games are really good, but then you get the movie and see how well it works live action!!!

I wasn't too sure about this movie when I saw it for sale, so I took a gamble and got it and really loved it! Usually anime to movie adaptations are, but this is a rare gem! The thing that made it work was really the actors. These actors really seem like they have watched the series and really studied their characters. I really believed what I saw coming from them. Also, the accuracy is pretty much dead on. The only difference was that Ranma's secret wasn't really a secret to Dr. Tofu, yet Tatewake Kuno is STILL just completely blind to the fact even though Ranma transformed right in front of him. Going back to accuracy, Ranma has done this many times in the TV show, so it is expected.

One thing I really appreciated that few people might catch is that Ranma male and Ranme female did look pretty similar and with Ranma female still trying to act like a boy made it really believable! Genma was exactly the same, anytime he was in trouble, he would turn into a panda and hold up signs to show what he is trying to say. I don't know how, but they pulled it off! Yes, Genma and Soun still play Shogi! Nabiki still finds ways to make quick money and Kasumi is just like she is in the cartoon. The Tendo training room was just like the cartoon, even Akane's room had the little pig on there that said Akane on it. It is really a live adaptation of the cartoon! The action, romance, and comedy is all perfectly balanced! This movie delivers in a way that many live action presentations cannot. One cool special effect feature and probably my favorite special effect in the whole movie was towards the end when Ranma used the powerful Shichihokoda. Unlike Lui Kang's anticlimactic fireball technique in the Mortal Kombat movie, this one was really cool!

The characters: (all played their parts better than in the TV series)
Ranma male (performs all the crazy tricks he performs in the TV series)
Ranma female (is actually a little shorter than Ranma male and yes, has a bigger cup size than Akane, this is important because throughout the whole series, Ranma makes fun of Akane for this)
Genma Saotome (plays Genma flawlessly)
Akane Tendo (see how she feels about Dr. Tofu, what happened, why her hair is short)
Nabiki Tendo (still the amazing blackmail artist, but in this case, I like her better than the anime version)
Kasumi Tendo (still the sweetest girl that is always nice to anyone, even when in danger)
Soun Tendo (actually does something other than play Shogi the whole time with Genma)
Tatewake Kuno (still can't figure out that Ranma IS the pigtailed girl)
Gosunkugi (just like in the game and the TV series, always taking pictures, seems to become Kuno's righthand person)
Dr. Tofu (played perfectly and shows his set of martial arts)
Vice Principal (good thing they did not go with the ALOHA principal like in the TV show)
Happousai (the master is just mentioned, but you never see him)

Characters that did not appear (Ones that I remember from the games and the TV show):
Mousse, Ryoga Hibiki, Shampoo, Cologne, Lin-lin, Lun-lun, Ukkyo, King, Kodachi Kuno, and Pantyhose

The plot:
Starts off similar to the TV series, but the main plot was definitely not what I expected. Since it is such a twist, I really don't want to ruin it because what I saw was probably one of the funniest plots I have ever seen in a movie and I had never expected such a plot.

Other things about the movie and DVD:
This may be an unlicensed import because there is a small transparent water mark in the top right corner which doesn't interfere with the movie and a small 1/2 (Ranma 1/2) logo on the bottom right. I don't know, I had something like this on Singh Is Kinng, so I am not sure about the legality of this disc. The packaging is similar to other Japanese movies I imported from Japan. There are no special features, the menu is static, there is I think a commercial to the film in the middle of the movie. The audio is Japanese only, English+Chinese+Japanese subtitles. The movie doesn't fade out at the end, it just returns to the main menu after the last bit of credit is shown as Ranma and Akane walk home with the camera far away. The film seems to be all there, but like others have said, this may not be legal.

Important to parents and those who must have fan service:
Ranma is NEVER naked and you never see her chest like how she likes to show in the cartoon, this is child friendly! If this movie were rated, I would probably call it PG because there is no bad language, no nudity, no suggestive themes, and violence really isn't bad.

Bottom-line, if you like Ranma 1/2 in anyway at all, or just want a good action-romance-comedy movie, then definitely grab this!! I can only hope that there is another movie featuring this same cast in the making! :)",1357084800,6,4909,4.477094972067039
7991988,4,B00009NH86,"Is a cute and funny adaptation of the anime series Ranma.
The writers collected the interesting themes from the first and second seasons of the anime TV show into one movie adaptation. These include the Nanichiwan springs, Ranma's bethrothal, among others.
Like the anime series is has a lot of humor and funny scenes on it, and the genderbender factor of Ranma. Also the main villains here are interested in an evil genderbender scheme.

The actors playing Ranma(female self), Soun and Tatewaki resemble their original counterparts and act them very well, along with the rest of the cast. This is just a fun and funny movie, apparently was a mini series in Japan, as the DVD includes mention of the sponsors there. Oddly as the final scene ends abruptly and the DVD quickly jumps back to the main menu screen. DVD includes English subtitles.

This is only aimed for fans of the anime and manga series that would like to their beloved Ranma in live action. If you are you won't be dissapointed. It does have the themes and plots and little funny details from the anime series.",1353801600,2,1076,4.718085106382978
