This WILL NOT give you a good overview of the war;  this WILL NOT give you a good biographical sketch of the major players; this WILL NOT give you an idea of broader themes and causes of the war. The historian in me weeps (and the Civil War isn't even my area of focus/concern!#

Still, I gave this 3 stars and here's how I defend that rating:  a)It covers the major battles: Manassas, Anietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Spotylvania and Appomattox.  b) The speaker is clear and direct - anyone will be able to follow along #but it will be too basic for those who know anything about the war).

I wouldn't buy this as a gift for anyone.  They'd hate you.  Forever.  Instead, I use this in my survey course while giving a lecture on the war - showing one or two battles as I go progress during the lecture.  Having said that, there's no way this should be used in a full semester course of the Civil War.  I would probably use this in a high school course, but again, only to punctuate certain parts of the lecture - you'll need to do full set up before showing parts of this.",1268092800,15,1202,4.316964285714286
8145947,3,B000IJ79SO,"I sent this DVD to my father for Father's Day, because he has a great interest in the civil war, and has studied it for many years.
When I asked him how he liked it, he tried to be polite, but had to admit that while interesting, the accuracy was poor.  While describing one battle, scenes were shown of a completely different location.  He has visited these sites, and knows one from the other.",1182643200,19,395,4.324324324324325
