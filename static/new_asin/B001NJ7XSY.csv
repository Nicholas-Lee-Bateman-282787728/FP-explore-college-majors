8327183,5,B001NJ7XSY,The secular education that now tends to make godless Marxists out of America's youth needs to be refocused to that which began under the guidance of our founding fathers.,1510704000,,170,4.896551724137931
8327184,3,B001NJ7XSY,"The product was fine. A little boring. I had to watch this for a class, and this was the cheapest I could find it.",1510704000,,114,3.7916666666666665
8327185,5,B001NJ7XSY,"If you want to know what the founders of our country really thought, watch this. This is based on an impressive collection of original documents, and not just someone's opinion. Every parent in America should watch this!",1397779200,,220,4.972972972972973
8327186,4,B001NJ7XSY,"This was for a class and it met expectations; covered biblical and secular history in education.
Talks about past leaders.",1384646400,,122,5.15
8327187,4,B001NJ7XSY,"The history contained in this DVD presentation is compelling. It helps the uninitiated get a better perspective of why the US became a great nation.  It also shows the primary reasons for our decline over the past half century.  This DVD is about an hour long and I enjoyed every bit of it.
I noticed another review about so called religious propaganda, but something to consider is this: it isn't propaganda if it is the truth.
I highly recommend that you watch this DVD.",1383004800,4,472,4.607142857142857
8327188,5,B001NJ7XSY,"I learned so much by watching this video.  This is great.  I think this is a must see for middle school, high school, and college level students.",1377907200,,145,4.333333333333333
8327189,5,B001NJ7XSY,"One of the best videos put out by WallBuilders. As a history teacher, I especially love the extensive use of primary sources that David uses to support his video. He includes many of those primary sources for viewers to see and check out for themselves for further validity. No educator, and certainly no Christian educator should miss viewing this film.",1337558400,,354,4.916666666666667
8327190,5,B001NJ7XSY,"David Barton does an outstanding job documenting how this country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. This presentation is a cogent reminder of how far adrift our government schools have journeyed. Sadly, our government schools have become the bastion of multiculturalism, secular humanism, and the playground for national teachers unions. These same unions constantly plead for more money
(ostensibly for students) when, in fact, they line their pockets while negotiating richer (and unaffordable) pensions for members. Our government schools used to be a source of pride and accomplishment. Now, they are a source of embarrassment and a testamonial to the heavy hand of the union monopoly.",1287619200,4,698,5.6571428571428575
8327191,1,B001NJ7XSY,"I ordered two DVD's by this author and was disappointed by both.  I found them to be well informed and delivered, but one sided.  Had I known that they would be religious propaganda, I would have thought twice before purchasing them.  A balanced delivery of history is not easy.  Still this was clearly a view supported by and meant for the religious right.  I will use this in my studies to inform this perspective on history.  So, it's not a total waste.  Still, I had hoped for more from such an all encompassing title and weighty online summary.  Warning to all interested in a more balanced approach to history and thinking.",1250985600,7,629,4.603603603603603
