7694353,4,B01CVS1QB0,"Ollie (Chris Dinh) is a robber who can't tell a joke. His girlfriend Blair (Katie Savoy) is level headed and laughs when she is scared in addition to supplying us with ""third reel"" cleavage. Through a comedy of circumstances involving a robbery gone bad, our couple teams up with Connor (Chris Riedell), Blair's brother, who insists he has leadership skills. His assistant is the equally inept Riley (Tim Chiou) who has cased a house for two weeks before they decide to rob it.

This just so happens to have been the house in an earlier scene that had locked rooms and a serial killer, Jack Taggard (Walter Michael Bost). They get trapped inside and run through the formula. The banter makes the film light and watchable. There are enough slasher elements in the production to classify it as horror in addition to comedy/thriller.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Could be a keeper.",1464480000,5,883,4.764705882352941

7694355,1,B01CVS1QB0,"This movie starts at 'fail' and goes downhill from there.

Exhibit #1: The young house-robbing couple consists two 30-somethings masquerading as house painters sitting in a brand, new van talking about retiring from the crime business, traveling the world, and then living a normal life with a house, kids, etc.  The wife (or girlfriend/fiance) looks like a model about to walk down the runway/catwalk to display the latest in Tyvex house painting-wear.

Exhibit #2: The couple chit-chats while robbing the house and cracking the safe -as if they're in a bar conversing with a cosmo in hand for the lady, and a martini for the guy.

I lasted a total of 5-minutes before signing out.

Not sure why anyone would give this vomit a 4-star rating, other than perhaps the producers and actors.  Avert you eyes from this silly production.",1533686400,,831,4.9

7694360,4,B01CVS1QB0,"Overview: Two robbers plan on one final score to settle a debt, but find the house they pick has a horrible secret within its walls.

Plot: 3/5
Spoiler Free! The plot of this movie isn't its strongest point, but the other areas are more than enough to make up for it. Other, more high budget movies have done home invasion horror (The Collector, The Collection, The Purge), but few have done it this well. A couple of thieves plan to pull off one final robbery to pay off debts and find themselves trapped in a house of horrors. On the surface, it sounds 'meh', but the other areas of the film are what make it worth the watch.

Visuals: 3/5
With the exception of one or two scenes, this movie isn't particularly gory or violent, however many horror fans will know that what you don't see can be more effective than what you do. Hearing the sounds of horrible things happening to someone can be more visceral that seeing the act itself, and this director uses this constraint to the max.

Sound: 4/5
The sound in this movie is expertly utilized to evoke a sickening feeling of 'what is that?'. Unfamiliar sounds are placed to throw us off, only to make the reveal of their source more disturbing. Likewise, the humor implemented is some of the sharpest in recent memory. Multiple times I genuinely laughed out loud! Herein lies what this movie does best. Too many horror comedy movies try to blend the two subjects, while CTS keeps them separate. When moments are comedic, you feel ""safe"" to laugh because you know the story has taken time for you to do so. When moments are tense, you know it's okay to get into the fearful mood because it's ""horror time"".

Pacing: 4/5
No part of this movie is boring, and I was hooked the entire way through. Constantly changing locales until entrapment in the house coupled with razor smart humor and a handful of very dark moments sprinkled in were enough to get me to stay watching. The movie was just the right length, and I felt perfectly happy with the ride I took from beginning to end.

Fear Factor: 3/5
While not terrifying, a 3 out of 5 for a horror comedy is saying something! Far too often, this genre falls into ""comedy with elements seen in horror thrown in"". Not CTS! This movie separates its horror moments and its comedic moments to be a fantastic blend of both.

Final Score: 4 out of 5

Verdict: Definitely an 'oil and water' layered movie of alternating comedy and horror, this movie is a definite watch from me! Bigger movies with larger budgets haven't gotten the mix of the two genres as right as Crush the Skull did.",1533254400,,2576,4.503211991434689
7694361,2,B01CVS1QB0,"There's a little bit of whodunnit going on here figuring out if the girl is involved or a victim.  The rest of this movie is junk.  I'd like to meet a few of the 228 people that rated this highly, give or take.

The punchlines are surprisingly original and poke at systemic issues in a lighthearted way, and I loved every second of it.

7694367,3,B01CVS1QB0,"Black comedy, pretty funny, though they overused punch lines too many times. The girl is drop dead gorgeous and her guy's a weenie loser whose only job is burglarizing homes. How a girl this hot would take up with him is a combination of movie fiction and women's low self esteem. They blow a job because the rich guy who owns the house has been suspecting his wife of cheating and catches her in the act, with them hiding in the closet next to the paramour. Then they're forced to join a heist her even stupider, more inept brother has hastily cooked up with a total idiot partner. They enter a house through the open sky light because they couldn't pick the lock or break a window, 2 red flags most pros would catch, but not these idiots, LOL. It turns out to be a serial killer's lair and house of horrors, complete with palladium reinforced windows and an array of metal doors that he can control from a main room in which he also watches them on camera. This lets him separate and box them in at will, like mice in a maze. They have the typical imbecile cop show up and do nothing, as usual, and I won't ruin the ending. It's amusing but not a serious flick in any way, almost like a spoof on the terrific, very tense ""Don't Breathe"" or ""The Collector"". Watch those if you really wanna be scared and see crooks get karma.",1531612800,,1326,4.308

I think horror needs a shot to the vein and a good horredy is even harder to come by.  Shaun of the dead was fun, but this film seemed to take itself more serious in the moments that counted.

7694430,4,B01CVS1QB0,"Amazon is plagued with terrible horror movies. Anytime I see one that has 4-5 stars with just ONE review, I always skip right over it. I'm guessing it is not very hard to film a movie and have it stream on Amazon, which is why there are thousands upon thousands of really bad horror movies. This is one of those very rare exceptions. I went into this movie thinking it would be a rip-off of Don't Breathe, then I realized this movie came out first. I initially put it on as background noise while doing work around the house, but not long after it started it, I couldn't ignore it. It is a very original idea and it was executed very well. And the actors do a good job of making their characters stand out, like the girl who laughs when she is scared, unlike those thousands upon thousands of other horror films where the actors seem to have learned how to act from ""b-level horror movie actors for dummies"".

The plot is pretty thin, the actors are better than high school stage, but not by much, and the cinematography is passable if you don't look too hard at it. The main characters are not built up very well, but they are somewhat believable.

Let's just say that nothing goes according to their plans. After a complete fuster-cluck forces them to team up w/ Blair's moronic brother, Connor (Chris Riedell) and his equally dense partner, Riley (Tim Chiou), the four ""super criminals"" set out on their caper. It all appears to be straightforward enough: simply enter a residence where no one is home, take the money and get out. However, upon entering, it becomes clear that something is terribly wrong. First, they realize they are trapped inside of a huge ""home"" that's more like a re-enforced prison / fortress. Second, it is discovered that the owner of said ""home"" is a serial killing maniac!

The title didn't make a lot of sense to me until the very end of the movie, but when they dropped the titular line it was a more satisfying conclusion than I have seen in many films. Wrapped it up with a bow.

In parts, it almost comes off like a typical slasher film, but the comedy dialogue and set ups give it a feel more like 'Abbott and Costello meet Saw'.  Even some of the grislier bits are given comedic treatments that work pretty well.

The story is predictable in spots (hey, it's a slasher film...), but the comedy helps break up some of the usual tropes.  The acting is pretty solid across the board, as are production values, set design, and sound.  I think the best part is the ensemble interaction; each character has their own quirks, but put them all together and it gets pretty stupid.  In a good way.

Crush The Skull is one of those rare hidden gems you stumble upon every once in a while, that completely restores your faith in lower budget Horror (though, to be fair, this film doesn't feel low budget at all--they worked very well with whatever they had), and makes you remember why you got a Prime account in the first place. I've been watching these things since preschool, but the film still managed to make me jump three times. Not an easy thing to do, believe me.

7694573,4,B01CVS1QB0,"When we went to Comic Con in Chicago we went to a couple of panels on Asians (or the lack of) in films, so this one really stood out to me since two of the main characters are Asian. And the other thing that stood out was that the main female was very intelligent, even though the guys refused to listen to her. Blair (Katie Savoy), said they should leave during the first heist, but her boyfriend didnt, which caused them trouble. Then in the house, she wanted them to all stay together and go upstairs to call for help, and of course that didn't happen. And there were a couple of other things she called out, but the others ignored her.

I enjoyed the game of cat and mouse that the killer played with them in the house, and the various ways people got killed/maimed were pretty good. There was some humor thrown in to keep from suspense overload, which is always appreciated.

They don't really touch on why the guy is killing people, but in a way that makes it even more scary. Some people are just psycho. Sometimes the acting seemed a little over the top, but they could have been trying to add a bit more comedy this way. If you're looking for something not too heavy on gore, and with a killer toying with his victims, I would say this is one to watch.",1475452800,2,1261,4.2719665271966525

8754286,1,B01CVS1QB0,"What could have been a successful serious horror flick plays out as a poorly-balanced horror-comedy.

A team of thieves break into what they realize (too late) is a house of sadistic torture, and they spend the rest of the film trying to escape.  There's your whole premise in a nutshell.

If the filmmakers had only pursued this premise seriously, ""Crush the Skull"" could have been a real horror thriller, given the fairly high level of acting, directing and cinematography.

Unfortunately, they chose to make the characters quirky and wisecracking, injecting way too much weak and misplaced humor that interferes with rather than compliments the urgency of the horror story.

A horror-comedy has to have a good balance of comedy and horror (as in ""Evil Dead II,"" for example), or else the comedy derails the horror, and you spend valuable time trying to get the horror back on the tracks.

That's exactly what happens in ""Crush the Skull""...They spend a few minutes building up legitimate suspense, then take a comedic time-out, then attempt to recover the suspense for a few minutes, then take another break for comic relief, et cetera.  The result is that the horror and comedy just don't flow together, as they should.

Consequently, about half-way through, this movie feels like it's worn out its welcome, and the remainder seems to just drag on and on and on (because the stop-and-go rhythm has become tedious).",1533772800,,1418,4.978813559322034
