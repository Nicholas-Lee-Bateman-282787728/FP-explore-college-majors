I haven't seen it so far, but i know them from TV - and they are still great!",1118880000,670,6617,4.8464351005484465
2322688,5,B0009ULBGS,"What an amazing buzz to know that the COMPLETE first season of Jim Henson's The Muppet Show is being released on DVD. Newly remastered the original British (PAL) tapes and including bonus footage like the ""Sex and Violence"" original pilot, raw footage and gag reel. The picture and sound have been remastered using state-of-the-art technology and the some of the bonus material has never been seen before. The DVD set will also include a Muppety-like felt packaging! I'm unsure at this point if the individual episodes will be intact (including the original opening sequences instead of replacing them with the opening sequences of the later series') but they are sure to include the UK skits. Hats off the Disney for seeing the need to release complete season box sets instead of the usual compilation DVDs that have been released in the past.",1118016000,13,844,4.950704225352113
2322689,5,B0009ULBGS,"The Muppet Show is one of my all-time favorite TV shows. I have seen most of the shows throughout the years and still own a large number on video and DVD. However, I do recognize that the individual shows are not always great - depending on my interest in the guest star and the quality of the variety of sketches. Some of the acts make me laugh and laugh and laugh ... others just feel like a waste of time.

The first season of the Muppet Show was in 1976. While most of my favorite shows are from later seasons, there are several shows this season that I look forward to owning on DVD. Plus I look forward to watching the shows in the order they were shown to get a feel for how the show evolved over the years.

As I understand it, there were two ""pilot"" shows - The Muppets Valentine Show (which I have seen) and the Muppet Show Sex and Violence (which I don't recall seeing). It would be great if these pilots were included in this 1st Season set, but I don't know yet if they will be.

From various reference sources, I have verified there were 24 shows the first season. They are (in order they were shown, as far as I can determine):

1. Juliet Prowse
2. Connie Stevens - this show also has Bert & Ernie. I don't recall the Sesame Street characters showing up on the Muppet Show. This may be the only show Bert & Ernie was in.
3. Joel Grey
4. Ruth Buzzi
5. Rita Moreno
6. Jim Nabors
7. Florence Henderson
8. Paul Williams
9. Charles Aznavour (a French singer/entertainer)
10. Harvey Korman
11. Lena Horne
12. Peter Ustinov
13. Bruce Forsythe
14. Sandy Duncan
15. Candice Bergen
16. Avery Schreiber
17. Ben Vereen
18. Phyllis Diller
19. Vincent Price
20. Valerie Harper
21. Twiggy
22. Ethel Merman
23. Kaye Ballard
24. Mummenschanz (Mimes) - in fact my listing for this show has always been ""Weird Mimes Act"".

There are a few shows this season that I just didn't care for the guest star, but generally a very entertaining season. I much look forward to this collection and future seasons as often as they can be released.",1117670400,198,2030,4.345646437994723

2322827,3,B0009ULBGS,"I bought this set in a used-DVD store, remembering this show from my childhood. I was born in 1965, so I was a young teen when this was on.

Watching it now. I couldn't BELIEVE how seriously dated and actually how mis-directed tis show seemed to have been. Specifically, though we now associate the muppets with things like Sesame Street and children, this show seems to have been aimed at an audience of OLDER adults! When you have skits like the one with Joel Grey ( I know---""WHO??""!?!) singing the opening song ""Wilkommen"" from the play ""Cabaret"" in a muppet cafe and playing the Broadway schmaltz to a perfect T, you KNOW that the kids were like, yaaaaaawn! In fact, sketches feauring songs from truly ancient, obscure plays and movies populate the show around some other truly funny and definitely child-oriented goofiness like the Swedish Chef. Even many of the jokes are adult-level, though not necessarily adults-only.

I honestly didn't remember this season--I recall the ""Alice Cooper"" episode which was decidedly much ""cooler""--but I can honestly say that the producers really didn't seem to understand the concept of marketing at the time. This was a ""Donnie and Marie""-styled variety show for adults featuring....muppets. It seems like it could have been so much more when I watch it now.",1430697600,,1302,4.967889908256881

It also reminded my of the passage of time as most if not all of the guest appearances are by performers who are no longer with us. Upside is that I got to see these wonderful people in their prime and how much joy they brought to the world of entertainment.

If you can't take fun, cute musical numbers, and corny yet clever jokes, this might not be for you.
As a few others have stated, yes, there are certain clips (very few) that weren't included due to copyrights but I don't feel that this detracted from the show in any way.  There were a few points where it seemed like the clips were jumbled around (i.e. Scooter being introduced a few episodes in after already being on the show for a few episodes), but again...no major issues for me.
I personally haven't had a chance to check out the extras such as ""Muppet Morsels"", but this is the only season that includes that feature.

The guest stars are great and have a wide range of talents; such as singers, dancers, actors, musicians, comedians and song writers.
The only thing I don't like about this release and the other seasons is the cardboard packaging and overlapping of the DVDs. The discs are hard to get out without scratching or dropping them unless you take out two at a time. One of the hubs no longer keeps the disc in place.

Ms. Piggy certainly has changed since her first appearance.  I feel like a kid when I watch each episode and I laugh just as hard.,1375574400,,307,4.0
2322954,5,B0009ULBGS,"First of all, if you are not familiar with the Muppet Show, it is a Laugh-in variety type show with Muppets. It is TOTALLY dated (Mid 70's) and totally Awesome! I borrowed season one from the library for my 7 year old. I had showed him the Muppets before and had been bummed that he did not like them as much as I did as a kid. But we were visiting my parents and the usual cadre of amusements was not available. I put in disc one and something clicked in my son's head. (I think it was the number 'Manamanah' which I hum all the time)  Anyway. He watched the whole season and it is his new favorite thing to watch, which lead me to buy it for his birthday. (And now his 4 year old little brother is in to it too.) I appreciate it because it is exposing them to people and pop culture from 40 years ago. My son talks about Vincent Price, and Ben Vareen more than Ryan Seacrest (Yeah!) And that my boys want to sing songs like ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" and the Bob Gibson /Kingston Trio song ""To Morrow"" instead of Maroon5, more than thrills me.

Yes there is puppet violence, lots of physical comedy and the like, but Kermit is the standard and he is rarely anything but kind, gentle, if not a but exasperated. It is much better than Sponge Bob where everyone is mean, violent, and name calls. If you are looking for totally inert, Sesame Street will fit the bill, But if you want something that is not totally mind numbing for the adult watchers, this ROCKS!",1374710400,,1459,4.225806451612903

I  was watching an episode where they had Burt and Ernie as a child you don't pick up on anything, but as I was watching it Burt and Ernie had the same or similar voices of the two people who did the voices of Kermitt and Fozzie  bear.

Ok, they may have been stars back then, but for the life of me, I don't know why.  They are definitely the weak link in each episode.  In fact, they are a distraction.

2323008,4,B0009ULBGS,"It is hard for me to imagine that I will say anyting which has not already been said about this set in earlier reviews. I was devoted to watching The Muppet Show when it originally ran (I think it was on Monday night at 7:30, in syndication.) Watching one episode a week made hearing the opening theme and business enjoyable. When you watch all the episodes, one after another, the repeated opening routine becomes very boring. My only benefit derived from that is to see that in fact it is always exactly the same, except for Kermit's announcing the special guest star, and Gonzo's running gag with the gong.

Which brings me to the innards. One might say the heart and soul of The Muppet Show was the running gag, spread out over all 22 episodes. Fortunately, most were creative enough to earn a smile or a chuckle, but Miss Piggy's karate chops got really old really fast, after the episode where she did seven in one show.

How do I know there were seven? Because one option was to enable on screen notes of facts about the episode, the puppets, the puppeteers, and the guests. One show counted the Karate chops. What these optional notes mean is that you will be sure to get at least two viewings, one without notes, and one with. I recommend you do the first without, because the notes are distracting, and you may miss a punch line.

The guests are by far the best part of each show, even though almost all of them perform ""potboilers"" for which they are famous in their past careers. But, Liza Minelli doing ""Mein Herr"" from Cabaret... with Muppets, is quite a treat, Just as seeing Joel Grey doing a number from the same show. It's remarkable that the one guest for which I had the greatest disappointment was on episode 22, with Mummenshanz. There is something to be said for song and dance, and the Mummenshanz mimery tended to be washed out in the context of this first class troupe of puppets.

Much is made of cut segments; however there are also many segments included, almost one per episode, where were not shown in the US, only in the UK. I don't feel cheated for those missing segments, however, it did make Charles Aznavour's appearance seem very short.

One may almost wish a DVD were prepared with all the repetition removed... and the deleted segments restored. But, still great fun.",1355011200,,2306,4.5603864734299515

I bought this after taking my nieces & nephew to see the last Muppet movie.  They loved it!  Ages 7 to 12 & they got all the jokes.  They even loved Waldorf & Statler!

This show reminded me how amazing Jim Hensen is & how he was ahead of his time.  Even thought there were changes to the characters appearances, watch Gonzo's nose change, it was still well done.

I don't have a favorite episode, but watch Ben Vereen doing Mr. Cellophane...simply brilliant!

Worse, even when this series premiered it noted that the old fashioned music hall and the acts that performed there were dying out.  The Muppet Show was not just a showcase for the muppets, but was a tribute to the old live entertainment from generatoins before, and lovingly mocked vaudiville while also showcasing what made it something special.

These episodes might be missing songs because copyright holders decided to refuse to release the rights, but they are still special.  Jim Henson and his friends turned simple puppeteering into magic and nowhere does it show up better than in the 5 years of the Muppet Show.  Kids and adults can laugh at the jokes and pratfalls as Kermit and his gang put on a performance worthy of the best of the old entertainers, and sadly missing from entertainment today where shows regularly look to go too far in their search of a way to thrill the audience.",1323820800,2,952,4.676646706586826

2323062,4,B0009ULBGS,"This is my son's review.

The first season of ""The Muppet Show"" is much different from the later ones. The reason lays in the writing. The first season writer focused mostly on gags. The guest stars are limited to onstage appearances, and Miss Piggy has smaller eyes. Still, it's great, and very fresh and funny. We're all waiting for the day when Gonzo accidentally kills himself. Some highlights of the first season are:

-Phylis Diller trades insults with Rolf.
-Ethel Merman sings a medley of her songs with the Muppets, including ""Anything You Can Do"" with Miss Piggy and ""De Lovely"" with Scooter and Gonzo.
-Scooter sings ""Mr. Bassman"" with Floyd Pepper.
-Charles Aznavour sings ""Inchworm"".
-Ben Vareen sings ""Pure Imagination"" to cheer up Droop.
-Bunsen Honeydew makes Peter Ustinov a robot politician.

Trivia: This season is actually edited. The reason being is that music distributors didn't want to give Disney the copyrights. Strangely, later seasons sets are unedited.",1318723200,,981,5.1572327044025155

The older set will appreciate the guest stars that appear. Many of the younger group will probably ask just who are these people. While the older group will get a laugh out of just how young some were. Like Vincent Price, Jim Neighbors & Paul Williams.

2323175,4,B0009ULBGS,"As a child of the 80's I couldn't help but fall in love with the Muppets though their feature films and the Muppet Babies cartoon series (which fans would also love to have on DVD, hint hint). Though The Muppet Show is a little before my time, all the clever witty banter and running gags that enchanted me when I was younger are still very much present right from the start. Yes, some of the material is dated, and some of the characters we love so much today had yet to be fully developed. I can't tell you how horrified I was to hear a voice other than Frank Oz's come out of Miss Piggy's mouth! But even so, the mastering is wonderful, with crystal clear audio and visual that would make you think it was filmed yesterday.

In regards to the editing and the ""completeness"" of this box set that other reviewers have discussed, as a retroactive fan it doesn't bother me too much. Everything that is included here stands pretty well on its own. However I would highly suggest that everyone turn on the Muppet Morsels option while watching the episodes, which allows for fun and interesting facts to pop up on the screen. You'll learn all sorts of random information about the show, the performers, the Muppets (including Miss Piggy's last name) and other tidbits that clear up some of the confusion over the order of production and changing voice talents, etc. For the record, the episodes as they appear on this set are in fact the order in which they were produced, but not necessarily the order in which they aired in different parts of the world, which explains why Scooter was suddenly introduced as a new character after already appearing in a number of shows.",1249430400,2,1667,4.556666666666667

Similarly, the theatrical references and ""nods"" made by the show's writers/performers would be lost on me now without the generous helping of ""Muppet Morsels"" present in Season 1 DVDs and not in Season 2.

The lineup is available from the summaries and other reviewers, and for the first year of a new type of variety show, was broad and impressive.  I am grateful that I am able to experience this type of entertainment as an adult; I take a pass on reality TV and drama shows.  Too bad the costuming, music and fee for guest performers made this genre of TV entertainment cost-prohibitive to continue.  I'm glad that DVD releases make series like ""The Muppet Show"" and ""The Carol Burnett Show"" available to us now.

2323218,5,B0009ULBGS,"The 1970's saw a lot of variety shows on TV, but none were as unique as The Muppet Show.  Here, you had large puppets doing the dances, singing the songs, telling the jokes, and performing the skits.  And they do it well.

It's hard to describe the typical episode because they have some variety.  Each episode features a special guest star (more on that later) who is involved in a few of the scenes.  There are usually a variety of skits and at least one or two song and dance numbers.  And there's the behind the scenes drama.  We are always treated to some backstage antics as poor host Kermit the Frog has to put up with the temperamental stars of the show.  Whether its stand up comic Fozzie Bear who thinks no one wants him around to a band who has decided the theme song isn't hip enough so they plan to quit, he's got to make sure the show goes on.

There are some regular skits.  There's always a segment where we are treated to jokes by people at a dance.  There are lots of Special News Bulletins with some wacky news items.  Veterinarian's Hospital is an excuse for really bad puns, so naturally, I love it.  And everything is commented on by Statler and Waldorf, the two gentlemen in the balcony who heckle everything, especially poor Fozzie as he tries to tell some jokes.

I do know enough about the show to know that some things haven't fully developed yet.  Miss Piggy's looks change later.  Beaker isn't helping Dr. Bunsen Honeydew in the lap yet.  And my favorite recurring segment, ""Pigs in Space"" isn't anywhere to be seen.  But what is here is still very funny.

As I mentioned earlier, each episode has a guest star.  While I recognize some of them, like Joel Grey, Florence Henderson, Candice Bergen, or Valerie Harper, I don't know who most of them are.  After all, the show is 30 years old.  But that doesn't matter because the jokes are still funny and the songs are still great.

As long as we're mentioned the songs, be on the look out for the classic ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" and the Muppet version of ""Mahna-Mahna.""  Plus this set is a rare chance to hear the words to ""Never Smile at a Crocodile.""

The set contains 24 half hour episodes on four discs.  All the episodes come with ""Muppet Morsels"" which are trivia tidbits that appear on screen every so often.  The final disc feature the original pitch reel and the original pilot, which is much different and not nearly as funny.  Finally, there are some fun promos that aired during the first season.

I avoided getting this season for a long time.  Why?  Because I was afraid I would love it and immediately decide I needed the rest of the seasons.  And guess what.  I'm looking to buy seasons 2 and 3.  This show is hysterically funny and still highly entertaining.  It hasn't aged a bit in 30 years.

So if you want a show that will make the entire family laugh, get this set.",1213833600,5,2868,4.416826003824092
2323219,3,B0009ULBGS,"Having picked up seasons 2 and 3 of ""The Muppet Show"", I felt I had to seek out season 1.  If you're a muppets fan and care about the fuzzy packaging, buy early -- my season 1 set lacks it.

The packaging is otherwise good.

DVD video and sound quality are exceptional for a videotaped program this age.

But as others have said time and time again, it's been butchered.  This means songs, and some lead-ups to them, have been excised (for copyright or contractual reasons).  Cutting up episodes like this is rather like selling a prosthetic hand after chopping off two of the fingers.  It's there, but it just doesn't feel complete.

On a personal level, as I've always found the skits to be funny and the songs more often that not a nuisance, I'm not that much bothered - except the lack of chapter cuts makes manual fast forwarding annoying.

It's still a reasonable collector's piece, but if you're a fan of the songs, you may be in for a shock.",1213401600,8,949,4.4393063583815024

Adults will get all the jokes and grandma and grandpa will be able to identify most of the guest stars.  The format of the show was still being set and so this is the season where the Muppeteers were trying out different things.

2323237,5,B0009ULBGS,"Three TV shows appeared in the mid-1970's that are now considered all-time classics.  The 3 shows are Saturday Night Live, All in the Family, and The Muppet Show.  Each show appeals to a particular segment of the viewing population, with the The Muppet Show directed at children.  But all three share several things in common.  First, they parody all the sins of human beings in general, and Americans in particular.  Second, each show tackled all the major and minor social, economic and political issues of the time.  Whether it be high energy prices, affirmative action, workforce discrimination, marital violence, job loss, inter-racial dating, medical malpractice, or any other issue, each of these shows tackled them.  Surprisingly, The Muppet Show handled these issues in a similar fashion as Saturday Night Live; short comedic skits that often parodied an idea, issue or cultural current.

Each show is about 30 minutes in length; i.e. these were shown on PBS so no commercials.  Many of the standard features that people remember from the Muppet Show slowly appear over the course of the first season.  These include the Swedish Chef, Vetenerian Hospital, the romance between Miss Piggy and Kermit, Fozzie's comedy act, and Gonzo's crazy tricks.  Note that they don't all appear in the first episode.  There are some muppet standards that are not present in this first season.  Two examples are the regular skit ""Pigs in Space"" and the character Beaker.  Like all good comedies, each episode has one serious section.  For the Muppet Show 1st season, this is Rowlf's jazz skit.

For the child viewer back then, or an adult viewer now, this show is a great window into American culture of the 1970's.  Dancers, actors, singers and other celebrities are featured.  No pro-athletes though, which is surprising given the large number of famous athletes during the 1970s.  Great show and great entertainment.",1200528000,,1911,5.106451612903226

2323244,3,B0009ULBGS,"I remember watching this show as a child, so you can only imagine how excited I was to find it in my local store yesterday. I immediately purchased it even though my wife strongly protested it's purchase. However, since she was in the midst of purchasing over a 100 dollars worth of products herself she had no alternative but to allow me to indulge in my muppet mania. There I stood in the middle of the aisle beaming like a child who just received his first candy bar. How easily amused I am. Although I give it only 3.6 stars I am still psyched over the purchased of this product. Allow me to explain.

The Good: The show is still entertaining, light in subject matter, non-offensive to children, and amusing to watch. A show both children and adults will find entertaining, and can watch together. Who doesn't like seeing Miss Piggy lay Kermit flat on his back, or those two old guys in the balcany insult the show all the way through?

The Bad: Some of the jokes and skits are a little weak at times. The show is definately dated which becomes painfully obvious as you watch it at times. Also, the first couple of episodes are weaker than the episodes that appear later on in the set. Some might be disappointed with this set if they don't keep a realistic perspective. Many of us loved the muppets when we were children, and as a child the muppets were the greatest show on earth. Believe me when I tell you if you hold that expectation when you watch this you will be disappointed.

Conclusion: This set is a worthy addition to your DVD library, and if you keep the right perspective you should thoroughly enjoy it. However, if one can not keep in mind the limitations of the era in which this show  was originally produced, or the humor that is meant to reach a broad audience from close to 30 years ago, you will be disappointed. This DVD is not a classic in that sense. Ground breaking for it's time? Yes!!! Yet I would be lying if I didn't say it was a little dated in spots. If you view this DVD set with the right expectations you won't be disappointed.

3.6 stars is what I give it, 3 stars means it's OK, this DVD set does exceed ""OK"" status in my humble opinion.",1196121600,2,2178,4.354679802955665

Came back and purchased season 1 despite some bad reviews and was happy to find that those reviews, at least for my family, were not accurate.

There are differences between the two seasons, but are more reflective of a show finding its feet. We are halfway through season one and it has been nice to watch the show grow.  The kids don't care what season it is, all they care about is who is the special guest and whether or not they sing :-) .

I had forgotten that many of the guest stars where international back then.  I had also forgotten what made some of them stars.  As I watched each episode, some of the details of the star status and the much more simple times of childhood came back to me.  It wasn't until the second season that many US stars emerged on the sets and became a part of the magical transition from puppetry to celebrities.  This set was a good way to introduce some of my childhood favorites to my own children.  Enjoy.",1190937600,,818,4.442953020134228

I bought this set as soon as it was released and got to relive those days of Muppet mayhem right before an evening of academic achievement, only without the academic achievement this time.  Now I can watch as many episodes as I want.

My favorite part of watching these DVDs now is seeing the guest stars.  Some are people I've long forgotten about, and perhaps there are a few I've never heard of.  (I can look those up on the Internet now.)  I never knew Florence Henderson could sing!

I can't think of a comedy show that could simultaneously entertain adults and children, and be absurdly dumb and clever at the same time the way this show can.  I like the TV shows better than all the Muppet movies.  This is Muppets in their element, on stage where they belong.  I hope to watch these with my kids when they get a little older.",1189296000,4,904,4.3273809523809526

""Muppet Night"" was a big deal in our house.  Special ""kid"" dinners, followed by the making of special desserts and then turning the living room into our private theater and being joined by our neighbors: all planned around ""The Muppet Show.""

Even though I was alone when I started watching all of the wonderful shows again, it was just like going back to the simple, happy times in our lives.

2323264,5,B0009ULBGS,"I grew up watching shows that Jim Henson had created or helped create:  SESAME STREET, FRAGGLE ROCK, THE STORYTELLER, and of course THE MUPPET SHOW.  I loved THE MUPPET SHOW as a child.  Years later my appreciation and fascination with the show has only increased.  The first season of the show might not have been the best of the series, some of the jokes aren't as funny and some of the best re-occurring sketches did not even appear.  For the most part, most of the performers were just beginning to become acquainted with their characters and in some places the unfamiliarity shows.  Some characters do not yet exist in Season One, for instance Dr. Honeydew's assistant Beaker (he arrives in Season Two) or the chickens that Gonzo adores so much.  Other characters appear in Season One, but are rarely seen again or sometimes disappear, e.g. George the Janitor or Wayne's performance partner Wanda.  None of this takes away from how delightful it is to watch the first season of THE MUPPET SHOW in its entirety.  Watching (and often re-watching) these shows is like traveling back through time and watching some monumental event once again on television, such as the Berlin Wall crumbling.  After watching an episode or two, I was giddy for the rest of the day.

The episodes are ordered according to their production number and not they way they were filmed or aired (different episodes aired at different times in the U.S. and the U.K.).  The list of guest stars for the season is listed below.

Episode 1--Juliet Prowse

Episode 2--Connie Stevens

Episode 3--Joel Grey

Episode 4--Ruth Buzzi

Episode 5--Rita Moreno

Episode 6--Jim Nabors

Episode 7--Florence Henderson

Episode 8--Paul Williams

Episode 9--Charles Aznavour

Episode 10--Harvey Korman

Episode 11--Lena Horne

Episode 12--Peter Ustinov

Episode 13--Bruce Forsyth

Episode 14--Sandy Duncan

Episode 15--Candice Bergen

Episode 16--Avery Schreiber

Episode 17--Ben Vereen

Episode 18--Phyllis Diller

Episode 19--Vincent Price

Episode 20--Valerie Harper

Episode 21--Twiggy

Episode 22--Ethel Merman

Episode 23--Kaye Ballard

Episode 24--Mummenschanz

My favorite episodes from this season include the ones with Rita Moreno, Jim Nabors, Florence Henderson, Peter Ustinov, Sandy Duncan, and Vincent Price.  The last episode in the series has the Swedish theatrical-mime troupe, Mummenschanz as the guests.  Mummenschanz was probably the most unusual guests to ever host THE MUPPET SHOW.  When I was younger and saw this episode it actually frightened me a bit, with all the strange masks and such, but now watching it again, even though it isn't one of my favorites, I really enjoyed the performances.

Each episode is pretty much shown in its entirety, except for six of the shows which had songs which can no longer be shown because of copyright issues.  In addition, every episode includes a segment from the U.K. that did not air when the shows were scene in the U.S.  Watching it on DVD is the first time Americans are able to see these U.K. spots.

The DVD set includes an option called ""Muppet Morsels"" that can be played with each episode.  This morsels are kind of like the bubbles from VH1's Pop-Up Video, but aren't nearly as annoying.  Some of the information the morsels provide becomes redundant such as telling when each episode was filmed and when it first aired in New York City.  Also, after watching enough episodes it becomes apparent that Disney is now in control of The Muppets because there are always little plugs for Disney films, shows, etc.  For instance, in providing information about a guest host a morsel might mention the productions the host is most well known for and then the next morsel says something like, ""so-and-so also starred in (Disney film), (Disney film), and (show now owned by Disney).""  These plugs are subtle and not obvious, but they are there.

Also included as a special feature is the original Muppet pitch reel that Jim Henson used to pitch the show to the executives at CBS.  Almost the entire pitch reel is available, but there is a very short afterwards from Kermit that has been cut because he asked ""What the h**l was that?"".  Nevertheless, even with the Kermit footage missing, it is a joy to be able to own this piece of marketing because it illustrates not only how creative Jim Henson was, but also that he was a savvy businessman.  Season One also includes the second Muppet Show pilot, ""Sex and Violence"".  There was a previous pilot, ""The Valentine Show"" that is supposedly going to be an extra feature on THE MUPPET SHOW: SEASON TWO.  Finally, the last of the special features is a promo gag reel, which really isn't a gag reel at all but is a series of promo spots highlighting upcoming episodes from season one.

THE MUPPET SHOW is a classic piece of American television.  It's a great item to own and watch together with families, but if you're a Muppet fan, it's a must-have item.",1179187200,10,4924,4.965686274509804

Season 1 was awesome I will admit that but, I hope Season 2 will be just as great as the first.

2323271,5,B0009ULBGS,"Definetly among my all time favourite shows. The first and only variety show of it's kind.

I used to find it interesting how Kermit was the only muppet character to be a regular staple on both Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.(Though in the merchandise market,he was never included in Sesame Street merchandise.)When first viewing the first few episodes of TMS,seeing Kermit from SS with a bunch of unfamailiar muppets took me some getting used to.

Season 1 is quite nostalgic and visually stands out from the rest of the series. Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy both look quite different. The openning credit scenes differ greatly from the following four seasons. Janice has a totally different voice. Bunsun Honeydew does Muppet Lab by himself. Not to mention,there was no such skit as Pigs In Space.

shows are 100%, but you can't have 100% all of the time.

This release was evidently done on-the-cheap, however.  There

are no chapter markers within the episodes-- you have to watch

the entire show, or use fast-forward/fast-reverse to skip to

a part you want to watch.  There are no special things-- ie

interviews, reminisces, etc.  The Time-Life series had chapter

marks for each act, plus Jim Henson's son introducing each

At only 9 months old, our child was certainly too young to appreciate much of the show, though there were moments/creatures that caught his attention from time to time.  What I found most unusual was that the episodes do not seem to be in chronological order.  As we progressed through the discs, there were a couple indications that they were not in the proper order:  1) Character voices were changing back and forth between episodes.  I assume they had not settled on each character's voice immediately, and changed part-way through the season.  2) Characters were formally introduced after already appearing as established characters in episodes we had already watched.  Of course, this is not a big deal if you just want to see the old shows, but it definitely creates major breaks in the flow and continuity of the season.",1167609600,2,1004,4.8023255813953485

2323295,5,B0009ULBGS,"This is a really great dvd set! I have enjoyed re-visiting these classic episodes of such an amazing and creative series. I certainly loved the Muppets from my childhood, but I have enjoyed them even more from an adult perspective. The musical segments are particularly entertaining.

The first season is a bit more experimental than later seasons, and some of the characters, like Fozzie and Miss Piggy, develop over the course of this season. The guest stars on this set are a veritable 'who's-that?' of 70's talent... there is an option for pop-up messages which give information about the guests, and behind-the-scenes information for each segment. The guest stars in later episodes might be a bit more recognizable to modern audiences.

This set is notable for featuring (mostly) un-edited episodes, including some alternate segments recorded for other countries. Some of this content has never been available on home video, or on American syndicated versions of the show. Also, this set features some notable extras. Aside from the 25 original episodes, there is the original pilot episode (if you read the comments for each episode, you will note that they made two pilots, and one became the first syndicated episode). Included in the extras is a very entertaining 'pitch reel' created by Henson and Oz to sell the show to CBS. These extras provide more insight into the history and development of the show.

EDIT: I only realized after I bought the set that a few musical sequences were cut from this release: noticeably missing were a few songs from the Vincent Price episode, and also Jim Nabors' episode was missing the opening number. The set is advertised as containing the 'un-edited full episodes' but, this is not the case, since they couldn't get musical clearance for all of the songs featured. I wish this were more clearly noted in the descriptions for the set, or somewhere on the notes for the dvd's. The entire series has previously been released on dvd from Time-Life media (and I believe those were actually un-edited, with all of the musical numbers included). The Time-Life set has introductions by Brian Henson for each episode, which are ok, but it doesn't include the pilot, alternate segments, or other extras of this season one collector's set.

The quality of the dvd's is pretty good for a 1970's television show. A couple of the earliest episodes look a little worse than the rest, with some ghosting of the images created by the bright colors on the original video, due to the processes used at the time. Also, you may notice some minor video artifacts, more noticeable on bigger tv's, caused by the mpeg-2 video compression since they put several hours of content on each dvd. But, overall, the image quality is good, and the remastered sound is also quite good.

I whole-heartedly recommend this set to people from my generation wanting to re-visit their favorite childhood shows, or parents looking for an entertaining show that they can share with their children as an alternative to current lackluster children's programming.

2323297,5,B0009ULBGS,"If you think you can't handle another minute of Elmo, perhaps it's time to introduce your kids to The Muppet Show collection. Even if you didn't watch the show as a youngster, you will probably appreciate the show's roster of guest stars, including Candice Bergen, Sandy Duncan, Florence Henderson, and other luminaries you may have forgotten--not to mention the show's smart, funny, and child-appropriate variety show sketches. Above all, it will remind you of Sesame Street's best years--before it was dumbed down by that irritating red character who refers to himself in the third person. (What IS that about anyway?) The Muppet Show Collection features Kermit and other beloved characters--plus the indomitable Miss Piggy! I recently showed the a couple of episides to my three year-old daughter and she thought Miss P was hilarious--and what child would wouldn't? She was a cultural icon! A great gift that seems a more worthwhile than most of the newer kid's shows on dvd.",1162684800,5,978,5.11875

Unfortunately I immediately noticed that some musical numbers featuring the guest stars, like Vincent Price singing ""You've Got a Friend"" (which appear on the old Time/Life videotapes) are missing on the DVDs. These were some of my favorite moments of the show, and it's too bad Disney was unable/unwilling to negotiate for these scenes.",1160697600,8,512,5.035294117647059

I had forgotten many of the eary episodes and was thrilled to see Juliet Prowse, Joel Grey, Connie Stevens and others singing and dancing with the Muppet Gang.  While Kermit ruled this plush mob, Miss Piggy quickly stole the show with her solo performance on ""Temptation.""  Later, in episode two, Miss Piggy takes amusing offense to Kermit's interest in Lydia, the tattooed lady. You can go to Kermitage to get a rundown on all the episodes.

Jim Henson's first Muppet creations were seen in 1954 and over the years they evolved into an incredible menagerie of characters, populating both Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.  Kermit and the gang even made it on a series of US stamps honoring Jim Henson.  However, it was The Muppet Show which really took the cake in my mind.  The writing and skits are so much fun, and can be seen over and over again, delighting new generations, like that of my five-year-old daughter.

2323307,5,B0009ULBGS,"It's official. The late Jim Henson was a genius. Besides all those wonderful characters, he created a show that could be enjoyed by both adults and children.  This DVD collection shows how this classic show evolved. Kermit the Frog had been on Sesame Street. The Sex and Violence pilot, included here, had cameos from Sesame Street regulars Bert and Ernie.  They also appear in the Connie Stevens episode. Rowlf had appeared with Jimmy Dean and on Purina dog food commercials. The Muppet Show also gave us Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the Swedish Chef, Statler, Waldorf, and many more.  A few characters, such as George the janitor, Hilda the wardrobe lady, Mildred, and Sam the Eagle's favorite singing duo Wayne and Wanda were dropped after the first season.  Some made brief appearances later. One word comes to mind:  ecclectic.  There must have been a fortune spent on music rights.  We get songs by:  Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Barry Manilow, the Beatles, Roger Miller (a future Muppet Show guest), Stan Freberg, Scott Joplin, and many more.  Various Broadway shows and movies get represented.  Wait until you see Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem do Tenderly! Jim Nabors sings Thank God I'm A Country Boy.  I was surprised to hear Twiggy sing so well. She's actually recorded several albums.  There are some great guests.  We have wonderful picture and sound quality.  The bonus features are quite good. Note:  the Muppet Morsels don't show up on all DVD players.  I found this out the hard way.  You can learn a lot about the show and its characters' evolution from this material.  There is even a version of ""Six Degrees of Muppet Guests."" Many have connections with other guests.  Several worked with the Muppets before and after their appearances on the Muppet Show.  I would like to add some information.  Paul Williams sang An Old Fashioned Love Song.  It was a hit for Three Dog Night.  He also wrote You And Me Against The World.  Kermit sang it with Helen Reddy on a later episode.  We also see segments that originally ran only in the UK.  This program was produced in London, England. One was the song Big Blue Frog.  I recall seeing it on another episode.  You'll watch these episodes more than once.  Enjoy hearing Mahna Mahna again.  I look forward to seeing the future seasons.  Too bad this show only lasted for five seasons! Muppets Tonight wasn't quite the same.  Have fun.",1153094400,4,2446,4.7913669064748206

2323311,5,B0009ULBGS,"Even the most loyal of fans would have to admit that lately the Muppets have produced some rubbish. The spark that made the Muppets so special when they revolutionised TV in the '70's seems to have died with Jim Henson and, since his death, only 'Christmas Carol' and 'Treasure Island' have come close to the magic. Certainly 'Wizard of Oz' and the Christmas special from a few years ago have been insults to the Henson name in trying to be 'cool' and roping in z-grade celebs.

It is so comforting then, to sit down and see why we feel in love with Kermit and co all those years ago. This boxed set is testament to the genius of Henson and (sadly) shows up the current Muppet output as the trash that it is. Very little can be said about the show other than it was innovative and extremely well done. Fantastic production values and such starry guests would be impossible to recreate now (see the appauling 'Muppets Tonight') and the writing and Muppet performers would never be better.

It's interesting to watch this first season to see the genesis of some of the characters. Some, such as Kermit and Rowlf, had careers prior to the show and are fully formed from the start. Others, such as Waldorf and Statler and Fozzie, are new for the show but basically haven't changed since. The interesting ones are those like Miss Piggy and Gonzo who grow and change as the series progresses and who may even start as almost unrecognisable from those characters we love today (Miss Piggy's changing voice is very disconcerting!).

The extras here are slim but make sure you use the Muppet Morsel feature. This gives facts and trivia along the bottom of the screen - particularly helpful when wanting to put the show in the 'historical context' of when it was made or when you want info on the guests or songs being performed. This info tends to repeat itself as the series goes on but I watched all episodes with this feature and it certainly enhanced the pleasure.

Also here is 'Sex and Violence', the oddly named pilot. This isn't great but hints at the madness to come. Bizarrely, at the end of this the camera tracks back to reveal the Muppeteers at work - a magic-shattering decision.

One last point to recommend this set - not a Pepe the Prawn in sight! As I said, the recent Muppet output is better off ignored - go back to when it all began.",1149206400,3,2345,4.52122641509434

2323314,4,B0009ULBGS,"""The Muppet Show"" was the variety show for whole family from the mid 70's to early 80's.  The comedy was ""clean"" but clever, the guest stars mostly B-list celebrities of the era.  The show was brilliant and, sadly, there's been nothing like in the last 25 years.

The first season DVD collection is loaded with great stuff. If you've never seen ""The Muppet Show"" before, each episode followed a basic formula of guest star solo song or dance, a guest star/muppet sing-a-long, and a handful of short comedic sketches.  Sure, some of the jokes are real groaners, but that's part of the charm of the show.

Watching these episodes from 1976 -- wow! 30 years ago already -- is like opening a time capsule.  The clothes, the music, the jokes, are all reflective of that era.  Paradoxically, although ""dated"" in those ways, the shows seem timeless.  Today's children will love the characters and get the jokes.  So-called ""Gen X-ers"" or ""30-somethings"" will love reliving these childhood memories.  Watching a few of the episodes last night reminded me of so many great bits and pieces of my early childhood.

The sound and image quality on these DVD's are good.  The shows look brighter, crisper than they did 3 decades ago.

2323317,5,B0009ULBGS,"There are some aspects of this show that some parents (not myself however) might find objection to when choosing a program for younger viewers.  Although it certainly was intended for youngsters that were older than Sesame Street age, there were a few ""violent"" moments in this show.  How about Rita Moreno beating up the drunk in the bar, the scary ineptitude of Dr. Bob (Ralph the Dog) in Veteranarian's Hospital, Harry the bomb specialist, Animal taking his girlfriend for a ""trip"", or Avery Schriver's duel with Jack (the giant muppet).  There is even a song by Ralph the Dog called ""You, Me, and Bob"" where Bob drowns ""leaving just you and me.""

For older children and especially adults (some who may have grown up with this show) the show is perfect entertainment.  It is a variety show in the best tradition of the best variety shows ever. Song, dance, comedy, and even a few serious moments.  It is the type of show where just when you think you've been entertained to the fullest, you find even more joy.  The guest stars not only added value to this entertainment, but 70's and 80's nostalgic value as well.

There are many reasons that this title earns 5 stars.  The memorable characters like the wise cracking Statler and Waldorf, the brilliant writing, voice acting,and directing, and most of all, the expanded vision of Jim Henson who believed that fictional characters could be brought to life, and that thier personalities could, and can, influence us ""real"" people in such a way so as to bring joy to our lives (even if it is in 25 minute spurts.)",1143072000,8,1564,4.6996336996337

2323327,5,B0009ULBGS,"A friend asked me, ""What could I get on DVD that my daughter and I can watch together?"" I told him the Muppet Show is great family entertainment.

This puppet vauldeville show may have bad one liners, silly songs, cute skit comedy, and over the top running gags...but it still works twenty years later and doesn't seem old at all. The humor seems like cute puns and gags, but that what the muppets are known for..their  running gags. In a way, this is a family version of Laugh-in (without that Sock-it-to-me!)

Kermit, the host who always seem to lose control of the show, has a great troupe of standard muppets (Piggy, Fonzy, Gonzo, DR Teeth and Animal, Statler and Waldorf)combined with other assorted muppets. The cast like any skit show (mad-tv, saturday night live, laugh-in)  can do anything from Dr. Bob, Pigs in space to simple schtick comedy and make it works.

The weekly guest star has moments where they can shine-whether its  singing, dancing or comedy...and where else can you watch such talents like Joel Grey, Rita Moreno, Vincent Price, Paul Williams, ben Vereen, Sandy Duncan, Peter Ustinov and others in true showcases of their talents

and this material does not date itself--how can you date fun?

I just hope Disney releases volume two soon!

I guess the Muppets was the comfort level that all partakers wanted between theater, education and space age technology.  As a student of the University of Maryland at College Park, I would be amiss to say that Henson and company did not grasp the social proximity of N.A.S.A. to the White House and then their House.  The inclusion of Bert and Ernie of Sesame Street further complicates the matter because some of the relationships really are not for children.  Life is a social experiment and I was curious as an adult to see what ""that"" humor of the past was like.  There television ""Budget"" was Real! The void placed amongst the ""Average Citizen"" in understanding that ""brand"" of humor, is to great.  Kermit decides who leaves the ""house"" and enters the stage but the T.V. audience is privy to the backstage antics, not the Balcony crowd.

No joke) I was 3 in 1976 so I'm not familiar with all the guest stars though if you turn on the feature called Muppet Morsels it tells you other works that person has done.  This is the entire 1st season of the muppets on 4 disks approx 5 hours.  Though I can agree w/ some of the reviews on quality and jokes ITS A KIDS SHOW (that adults will love) the only regret is I had forgot about the Phantom of the Muppet Show and now my daughter is afraid to watch it.

2323332,2,B0009ULBGS,"It's great to see the old Muppet Shows again but this ""special collectors edition"" is a shoddy piece of work. For a start I very much doubt that this is the first Muppet Show series. It maybe the first one broadcasted in (or made for) the USA, but that's something else.

A truly annoying feature of this release are the very limited navigational options. When you're watching one episode you can jump to the next one, but you can't jump back to a previous one. And scene selection is missing completely. If you want to see a particular Swedish Chef / Muppet Lab / Whatever scene, you'll have to fast-forward your way to it. Like on an oldfashioned VHS tape, yes. Furthermore the shows on the DVDs are in the wrong order. This becomes very clear when Scooter, who is present from the start of disc 1, appears as a newbie in the Muppet theatre 5 episodes later and is then introduced to everybody. Huh?

In short: the Muppet Shows are great, but Disney has wrapped them very poorly indeed. Special collectors edition? Special as in 'a quick re-release to make a few bucks' ?",1139616000,29,1073,4.4974358974358974

But ""Classic"" doesn't mean ""old"" in this case.  It means something that can be enjoyed today as much as when the first aired 30 years ago.

Yes, it's true you probably haven't heard of all the guest stars if you're under 30.  But that doesn't matter because the stars of these shows are the Muppets themselves, and they always bring out the best in everyone, including any humans lucky enough to work with them.  The Muppet Show is like Laugh-In, except Laugh-in was a product of its time, and the Muppets are apparently timeless.

The humor is broad but clever.  And it's very interesting to see the development of the show in its first year.  Miss Piggy, for instance, was just a supporting character until she proved herself worthy of the spotlight.  And it's great to see Rowlf, my favorite of the bunch, and his songs, many of which were never aired in the U.S. before.  There's also a terrific pop up trivia track for each episode, and the original Muppet Show pilot.  Very neat.

I do agree the loss of some songs for legal reasons is disappointing.  But even without them, this is still a great set.

Anyway, where else are you going to see Florence Henderson sing ""Happy Together"" with a bunch of monsters or hear jokes from a bear?  Nowhere but here, pal.  So sit back and relax because this is what we call The Muppet Show!!",1137715200,4,1497,4.588679245283019

What keeps this from being a 5-star review?  The fact that each episode is a single track.  I can't zoom to a favorite moment in the episode; I can't easily skip over a segment that I don't like.  I hope that future seasons will have the episodes subdivided into sketches.",1136505600,3,497,4.744186046511628
2323340,4,B0009ULBGS,"When purchasing this DVD set, you do so while taking the risk that your player may not able to show the ""Muppet Morsels"" feature. Thats the only major gripe I have with this DVD set. My player won't play the morsels. If another reviewer out there would be so kind to tell what kind of player they have that shows all the features, that would be great.

Mine is a CyberHome CH-DVD 300 model.

Otherwise, these episodes look and sound brand new. I hope in future seasons, Buena Vista will consider chapter stops. That would make indvidual episode naviagtion so much easier. In the first season, the guests weren't the stars of the day. Many of them were friends of the show's staff and creators, or celebs that were in the twilight of their careers. Nevertheless, there is something worth seeing and worth waiting for in each episode. The writing is spotty at times and it's not a laugh a minute, but its a stunning testament to the wonderful world of Jim Henson and his sensational crew. I'm reliving my childhood as I watch my children witness this stuff for the first time. It truly is a moving experience. Even though I cant see the ""Muppet Morsels"" feature...I say the DVD set is money well spent. I guess I will have to save up some money and get a new DVD player. Finally, I would recommend pacing youself with watching these DVDs. It is roughly 10 hours of material! If you try to watch it several hours a day, you may begin to cringe when you hear the muppets theme song. Dont overdo it.

I remember watching it when I was little and not understanding most of what was going on, but still loving it.  I caught it again later in reruns and loved it even more.  So a nice Season One box set with Kermit felt cover was very welcome in my home.

Why only four stars?  Well this is kind of a bare bones set, though not completely.  The pop-up trivia feature is fun, though sometimes a little overdone.  Sometimes you'll just get a factoid about something mentioned in a song - like the Battle of Waterloo - that's really just there to have something on the screen, not because it enhances your Muppet watching experience any.  It is also nice to have the pitch and original pilot included.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it looks like some bits were dropped, possibly for copyright reasons, which is unfortunate.  ( I thought I remembered Wayne and Wanda doing ""Stormy Weather""; I guess I was right.)  On the plus side, you get several numbers that originally aired only in the UK.

Aside from the missing songs and not enough extras, this is a great fun box set that old fans and new can all enjoy.  I sincerely hope we get more seasons in the future.",1135728000,5,1238,4.424778761061947

Dissappointed that some things were cut and wish they had the extras like there is on the Fraggle Rock First Season set like the desktop themes.

One great extra in this set that isn't in the Fragge Rock set is the ""Muppet Morsels"". If you fall asleep during the slow parts, make sure you turn on this feature. It tells background info on who wrote the music, who is performing what Muppet, Jim Henson & Company history and more.

Thirty years later, it is incredible how the humor in the skits still works perfectly. In spite of the fact that most the guests were celebrities back in the late seventies and early eighties (the majority of them would be unknown to most of this generation), the laughs don't stop when you pop in these DVDs in your player. Just watching the one-liners of the characters in the ballroom dance or reliving the Swedish Chef cooking up fun is enough to wake up a battalion!

Without a doubt, The Muppets (and Jim Henson, as their creator) will go down in history as a classic of the humor genre. And this DVD set will definitely be one of 2005's best and most awaited releases.",1135209600,4,821,4.473333333333334

It fills a long time fan demand to ""just release all of them, darnit!"", not just the ones with popular guest stars.  It also restores the original opening whereas the previously released versions had a ""revisionist"" first-season opener (because, frankly, the first season opening bit wasn't as good as the later seasons, but we wanted it anyway).  The DVDs contain the full British versions of the show, with the extra bit that was cut from the US ones to make space for more commercials.  I also consider it a plus that these aren't introduced by Brian Henson.

HOWEVER

Apparently due to musical royalty issues, there are unannounced cuts from the shows.  For example, the ""you've got a friend"" bit is missing from the Vincent Price episode.  The royalties from some songs make it impossible to sell full season DVD sets at a price the publishers believe we'll pay, so cuts happen.

SO if you are buying this to relive some Muppety happiness with your family, it will be fine.  BUT if you are someone who knows the cat's named Gaffer, Snowths are the ""Doo do di doo doo"" critters, and that the tastiest creature in the universe is found on the planet Koozbane, you may be dissapointed, because you, like me, would pay extra to actually have the *full* first season.",1133654400,22,1334,4.662393162393163

Jim Nabors

***HOWEVER*** that still means that I paid $30-35 for 19 *un*cut episodes (and bonus features), which is a *great* deal, since a single DVD of three episodes would otherwise cost $15-20. The cut clips (with the exception of the pitch reel ending) are out there, including the internet. The benefits outweigh the losses. This is a great set, so don't let the cuts discourage you.

Kermit is great.  Statler and Waldorf are a hoot.  Fozzie makes me giggle.  It's fantastic to see Miss Piggy transform over the first several episodes from an anonymous pig into the diva we love.

One of the best spots, though, originally aired in Britain, but not in the U.S.  On the Vincent Price episode, three ghosts sing a Lennon/McCartney song and it is just mesmerizing to watch.

The price of the DVD definitely includes the insert (if there truly is one as money was definitely spent in designing and printing said booklet). Also, it's really a pain when you try to look for a certain skit as there are 4 discs and about 7 episodes per disc.

From the sparse set of the first show to the elaborate production numbers in later episodes. You can definitely tell they were given a bigger budget. I have one quibble.

2323364,5,B0009ULBGS,"Finally. It seems like every show ever put on TV except the Muppet Show has seen a DVD release. Now at last we have Season One of the most bizarre, visually stunning, and entertaining thing to ever grace a television screen. The Muppet Show looks and feels like no other show. It all began in 1976, well before the computerized entertainment age. So all of the characters, monsters, set pieces, voices, and stunts were done by people using actual physical materials. No bits or bytes here. What Jim Henson and Company accomplished with this medium still remains impressive some thirty years later. This DVD set allows fans to see the spectacle unfold from the show's brilliant pitch reel to the pilot and finally to the show itself.

The world of the 1970s variety show might seem quaint and dated to the hyper-paced no cut longer than 2 seconds media world of today. Entertainment in this genre meant dancing, singing, puns, slapstick, and ridiculous situations. Special effects comprised no more than analog wipes, dissolves, multi-framed keys, or excessive color saturation. The Muppet Show showcases the technology of the day and the crew used what they had at their disposal to great effect. But the main attraction were the Muppets themselves. To have humans and puppets share a stage involved a high degree of complexity. The stage had to be raised and specially built to accomodate all of the interaction. And Henson took puppetry to its extreme. He had plenty of practice on his then popular Sesame Street (it premiered in 1969 and still runs today). But where the main focus of Sesame Street remained children (but plenty existed there for adults as well) The Muppet Show targeted adult audiences directly. And adult entertainment in 1976 meant the variety show (even though the genre was in a bit of a decline; the early 1980s saw the obliteration of nearly all variety shows).

At first the show had trouble attracting guest stars. The idea of appearing on stage with a bunch of puppets probably didn't appeal to the sometime self-indulgent celebrity ideal of the time. Only after the show became a huge hit a year or so later did the big stars agree to appear. So Season One features some now obscure names (another sign of how the times change): the late Juliet Prowse dances with dayglo green giraffes; Paul Williams sings ""Just an Old Fashioned Love Song"" with two Muppet likenesses; 1960s entertainer/model Connie Stevens struggles for the spotlight with 2 giant muppets; dancer/Broadway star Joel Grey goes to a Muppet cabaret (with ""a beautiful orchestra""); Rita Moreno struggles with Animal's hyperactive drumming on ""Fever""; Sandy Duncan has her skirt removed by large muppets during a musical number. Other names will be more familiar to people today: Broadway legend Ethel Merman, Florence Henderson (""Mrs. Brady""), Candice Bergen (of ""Murphy Brown""), Lena Horne, Vincent Price, and the first famous emaciated model Twiggy.

But, again, the real attraction are the muppets themselves: Kermit, Mrs. Piggy (her voice changes throughout the first season), Rowlf the dog, Gonzo (who begins as a frustrated artist). Dr. Teeth, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (no Beaker in Season One), Fozzie Bear, Statler and Waldorf (the hecklers), The Swedish Chef (who remains almost unchanged), and countless others. Some of the musical numbers approach the surreal (check out the ""Hugga-Wugga"" song on the Phyllis Diller show for a good mind bending). Others are just hilarious (Ruth Buzzi and Sweetums' violently slapstick ""You're Just Too Good To Be True""). Some have 1970s fashion and music splashed all over them (Florence Henderson's first song may evoke a ""Whoa!""). But the famous ""Pigs in Space"" doesn't appear in this season at all. In the end, Season One displays the show developing its own very unique personality. It hasn't quite made it yet, but by the end of the season it's very close.

The pilot shows just how much the show changed from concept to reality. Kermit only appears briefly (promising a shapely female Muppet a spot on a ""Children's educational program"" before sneering at the camera), and the pilot's host becomes the band's conductor in the series. There is little emphasis on music or guest stars, so something drastically changed before the show went on the air. The big highlight of the pilot comes at the end: the camera pulls out to reveal the puppeteers (including Henson of course) manipulating their puppets from underneath. It shows just how bizarre filming this show must have been.

Lastly, don't even think about missing Henson's incredible pitch reel. It speaks for itself.

So here it is, finally. Season One of the Muppet Show. It's great, it's funny, it's a spectacle, it's a blast from the past. And all fans should watch this show until they have every frame memorized. And now the painful wait for Season Two begins.",1128729600,11,4861,5.002472187886279

1. The shows are not in the orginal broadcast order on the DVDs.  I don't understand this at all, as it leads to some confusion when sequential ""inside joke from last episode"" references are made.

2. No episode guide comes with the set even though the packaging clearly has space made available for it. That is prety rediculous, especially the episodes aren't in chronilogical order.

3. The manner in which the discs are packaged was not well thought out.  The four discs are layered 2 on 2, which makes it impossible to remove the ""back"" discs without first removing the ""front"" discs.",1127779200,10,765,4.75

There really is no way to adequately express how wonderful the Muppets can be.

So why am I only giving this collection 3 star?  Because despite the claim on the box of being ""restored and remastered,"" some of the episodes have been butchered.  I saw the Vincent Price episode when it was originally shown, and it closed with Vincent and the Muppet monsters singing ""You've Got a Friend.""  It was, for me, one of the most enjoyable scenes in the series.  The sequence was included in the Columbia House ""Best of the Muppets"" series, but it is excluded from this set.  Likewise, the Jim Neighbors episode originally opened with Jim singing, ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""  Re-runs on Nickelodeon included this sequence, but the sequence is missing from this set.  I can only guess what is missing from the other episodes in the set.

Mind you, these omissions do not keep one from enjoying the set, especially children who did not see the series when it originally aired and do not realize that they are missing.  And, I must admit, the screwy antics of the Swedish Chef and the weekly face offs between Fozzie Bear and Stadler and Waldorf still make me smile.  Still, it is frustrating to read that the episodes have been ""restored"" when they clearly have not.",1127779200,394,1539,4.669144981412639

When last viewed as a child, and now viewed as an adult all these years later, has The Muppet Show lost any of it's initial brilliance, wit & charm?  Nope, none at all.  Although it was a little disheartening explaining to my kids who Guest Stars like Jim Nabors and Rita Moreno and Connie Stevens were.  How times fly and stars descend.  The youth and vibrance of The Muppets as a form of entertainment and innovation is still there.

2323388,4,B0009ULBGS,"There have been many good reviews of the series itself earlier so I won't repeat too much of that.

The 24 episodes on the 4 DVDs are somewhat different than the later Muppet show most of us remember. A lot of characters and skits were still being experimented with, or not present yet, and even Gonzo is a very minor character in this season. The content is intended for a somewhat older audience than Sesame Street and the Muppet movies but there is a little something for everyone. The pitch and the pilot episode are included plus some other nice features.

About the DVDs themselves, the sound & picture quality are both excellent, and the tri-fold case fits into a slip-cover. But the 4 DVDs are in only two sections of the tri-fold so each pair has one DVD overlapping the other. You pretty much have to put DVDs 3 & 4 into another case so you don't take a chance on damaging the other two.

2323399,4,B0009ULBGS,"From it's opening episode, The Muppet Show has proven that there is a child in each one of us. And getting in touch with that inner kid can be pretty darn fun.

I loved this show when it was on television. I enjoyed seeing who would be their next ""special guest"" (from getting a crush on a young Sandy Duncan to laughing out loud over Vincent Price's over-the-top parodies of horror.)

But, of course, the real stars of the series are the muppets themselves. Kermit stays pretty much the same throughout. He's the default leader of the show, a charming and gracious, uh, frog.

Ms. Piggy is the character with the most growth, as she goes from a simple dancing partner during the ballroom skits, to Kermit's love interest (if they had a complete interspecies relationship, would their offspring be Progs? Or Figs?)

Fozzie Bear is the corny comedian who has to deal with his substandard material and the heckling of the in-residence old farts who inhabit the balcony.

Gonzo, Dr. Teeth, Ralph the Dog (piano player extraordinaire), the Swedish Chef, Wayne and Wanda, Sam the Eagle, Crazy Harry, and a multitude of other muppet characters never fail to entertain (one of my favorite repeat skit's was Veterinarians Hospital, ""a show about an orthopedic surgeon who's gone to the dogs"", but that might be because I'm IN the medical field!)

But if there's one muppet that has continually entertained me, I'd have to say it was Animal, the red-haired, over-active, and sometimes insane drummer in the muppet orchestra. Whether he was chasing around a guest host because she was cute, or dancing under a chandelier and slamming his partner onto the floor, I never failed to at least crack a smile when he showed up on-screen.

This DVD set (containing 24 episodes) was a great walk down memory lane, catching up with many actors and actresses I had forgotten about, and getting me back to my inner kid, even if just for a little while.",1126742400,,1931,4.746268656716418

Why couldn't Disney do the right thing and put the shows in chronological order of each show's first appearance? I expected the first selection on disc 1 to be the first showing (or the premier, whichever).

I get the feeling that not a lot of thought went into the dvd set's presentation. 1st- the set came with no informational insert despite the fact that there is clearly an inside pocket for one. 2nd- Although the tidbits/commentary that pop up during the show (when that option is selected) are interesting, they can at times be bothersome to the eyes when reading. There are several typos that show very little, if any, proof-reading was done. 3rd- Again under the commentary option, a big, ugly, neon green Kermit head will appear before some comments, and several bright question marks before others. These overlay smack on top of the show and can't be missed. Poor taste in my opinion. 4th- the menu didn't look so hot, I thought ""the muppets greatest hits"" menu was much better. 5th- the sound level isn't adjusted right on the menus or bonus features. Video quality overall is good, considering the age of these shows.

It would truly be a perfect set if these flaws were corrected, as hopefully they will be, for season 2! (pay attention buena vista!) If you are a muppet fan, I advise you still buy the set, just don't watch it with the commentary on!",1126483200,4,1217,4.682242990654205

One of the few observations I recall from watching the show as a child was that the guest stars segments were usually boring.  Somehow, this hasn't changed: I'm no more familiar with stars of the late 70s now than I was in the late 70's. Still, some of them are done amusingly enough that it ends up not mattering that you've never heard of the person.

A note on the box set: I got the impression that the episodes were not presented in order, because Scooter was introduced as the new ""gopher"" somewhere around the 6th episode on disc, despite the fact he'd been highly visible in that role in all the preceeding episodes.

""Please contact our Consumer Relations Department at 800 723-4763, and they will be happy to assist you in resolving this issue.""

Calling that number puts you in touch with Buena Vista video customer service.  The ""cast member"" I spoke with was very apologetic and seemed to know exactly what I was talking about and missing.  She took my name and address and said one would be sent out immediately.

""The Muppet Show"" gives us a semi-harrassed Kermit as the manager of ""The Muppet Show"" itself. Featuring Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, Fozzie Bear, Rowlf and many others as the stars of the show, Kermit  has a lot to handle! Each guest star brings something different to the table. Just some of the stars are master horror actor (and chef) Vincent Price, singer Ethel Merman and comedian Harvey Corman.

Each show gives a perfect example of the blend of slapstick humor and sweet mellow comedy that Jim Henson is famous for. This show is great for all ages, although some of today's younger veiwers might not recognize the guest stars.

In short, a wonderful show to be enjoyed for generations to come.

Both of us were impressed by the overall quality and snazzy packaging of the DVD set (although the packaging is lacking one major component...I'll get to that in a minute). This four-disc set contains all 24 episodes from the first season of the show, back when ""The Muppet Show"" followed a pretty rigid format and Miss Piggy sounded more like a drag queen than the scrappy, high-pitched suidae she evolved to be. Memorable guest stars from the first season include Florence Henderson, Candice Bergen, and Vincent Price (my personal favorite). The DVD set also contains a decent amount of bonus features, including two never-before-seen episodes and Jim Henson's original pitch reel. Overall, this is a great DVD collection that is a must-have for any Muppet enthusiast.

Now for the question everyone has been asking...what's up with that flap?! Like many other Amazon.com reviewers, I was befuddled by the fact that there is a slot in the DVD packaging that was obviously made to hold a booklet of some sort, but there was no booklet included with the set. Thinking that there was a component missing, I probably would exchanged my set if I hadn't stopped to read the other reviews on Amazon and learned that everyone was experiencing this problem. I guess the people who put the DVD set together just ""forgot"" to add a booklet. Sheesh! That makes it pretty hard to navigate the four DVDs because you have no way of knowing what's on them until you actually pop them in the DVD player, which stinks. (That's the only reason I gave this item four stars instead of five.) Perhaps we can write down the details of all the episodes as we watch them and store our notes in that useless little pocket. Hopefully the second season will include a booklet of some kind, or at least a list that details all the different episodes.",1126137600,6,1924,4.7432835820895525

The Muppet Morsels feature on the discs is great.  It's interesting to see little tidbits about the show that give it depth and context.

I watched this show as a very young child, but I remember my parents enjoying it with me.  Watching it again now, I see why.  The humor is corny but that's the way it's supposed to be, and the guest stars were the most talented people in stage, TV and movies at the time.  It gave us a chance to see the full range of talent these people had.  We don't have any shows like this today, and it's probably because there aren't very many well-rounded performers out there--or at least, not any that are willing to showcase those talents like the guest stars on the Muppet Show did.

Teenagers and young adults today who didn't grow up with The Muppet Show probably won't appreciate this show like I do, but it's certainly appropriate for young children and adults alike.  If I ever have kids, they'll be growing up with this show like I did.

I still laugh at the Swedish Chef and Miss Piggy's karate chops, and I still root for Fozzie every time he goes out on stage to battle the heckling Statler and Waldorf.",1125360000,,1384,4.413385826771654
2323427,5,B0009ULBGS,"If you are old enough to remember watching the Muppets in syndication when originally aired, then nothing I can write will do your memories justice. You already KNOW what to expect, and you will buy this set pretty much no matter what.

If you are not old enough, you are in for a treat. You see, back in the day when your parents were snot-nosed brats themselves, people had a thing called ""talent"". They would put this talent on display on a wonderful box called ""television"". One result of this global talent competition was the Muppet Show. Kiddies, sit back, watch, learn, and be amazed at what truly good television was back in the day.

The Muppets didn't need to drop the ""F""-bomb, abuse or demean people to be funny. Today, that is called a ""novel concept"", but back then it was par for the course. You either had the ability to make people laugh, or you did not. Jim Henson was one of the very rare people who had this ability, even if most TV executives at the time couldn't see it. Thank God for videotape and now DVD, or you young people would totally miss out.

Some of the best entertainers in the world put in appearances on the Muppet Show. Shoot, most of you won't even know who Sandy Duncan, Kaye Ballard, or Jim Nabors was, or why they were popular. It's all about the talent, my young friends. It's all about the talent. Yes, the trivia pop-ups are killer, but my only beef with the DVDs at all is the pop-up Kermit head gets really old, really fast after... oh, the 500th time. On this point, and this point alone, less would really have been more.

So what do you really get for under $50? You get the best history lesson (vis-a-vis popular culture) of your entire lives. I am telling you, to have the humor stand the test of DECADES is proof of the sheer talent of the people who created and performed on this show. You will not be disappointed you own these DVDs. But if you still need convincing at this point, then I offer up three little words -

Statler and Waldorf

'Nuff said.",1125014400,6,2007,4.381720430107527
2323428,5,B0009ULBGS,"""It's 'The Muppet Show', with our very special guest star, Miss Ethel Merman!"" When was the last time you heard Kermit the Frog intone those words? Too long, it says here. But ""The Muppet Show"" is back with a bang! (""Did somebody say 'Bang?'"")

  Yes, here on four glorious discs, the initial season of one of the funniest, most inventive, and most colorful TV shows ever. I was a fan back then, but seemed to watch mostly for Kermit and the guest stars. Now, I love to see the dozens- maybe hundreds- of creations, characters and comedy bits that made up this unique outfit, all from the mind of the late and very great Jim Henson.

  The first thing I'll discuss is the video quality, which is fantastic. Many of the tapes come from the original British sources (the show was produced in the UK). For something that's nearly 30 years old, the shows look and feel brand new! You haven't seen the Muppets until you've seen this. The colors, music and movements come jumping right out of your set- it's like watching it live as it happened!

  As for the shows themselves, the format was obviously inspired by ""Laugh-In"", arguably my favorite show of all time: quickie comedy skits, quirky musical numbers, running and sight gags. The setting, of course, was backstage at the Muppet theatre, with host/manager Kermit running the show. A few of the regulars, notably Miss Piggy, didn't really jell until about the seventh or eighth segment, but once they did, you can't beat it.

My favorites include Rowlf, the piano-playing dog; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, the green ball with the wacky inventions; and so many more.

  You'll be impressed by the top-drawer guests the Muppets attracted- everyone from Parisian cabaret artiste Charles Aznavour to, as noted and quoted, the one and only Ethel Merman (joined, memorably, by Miss Piggy). Arguably the best single episode here features one of the loveliest chanteuses ever, Lena Horne, who sings the jazz standard ""I'm Glad There Is You"" to...Gonzo? Hey, it worked. Like the best cartoon characters, you always feel that the Muppets are living, breathing things, not just, say, a piece of green felt. Some surprises, too, like Bruce Forsyth, a lanky English music-hall entertainer who fits in with the group better than almost anyone.

  Of course, the classic numbers are here: ""Mahna Mahna"", one of the most famous Muppet routines, was actually the very first number on the very first show! I guarantee you'll have this silly little tune (from an Italian ""mondo"" movie) in your head right away. How about Kaye Ballard singing ""One Note Samba""

with a big blue monster- and playing it on clarinet, flute and tuba? That's right, a tuba. Senhor Jobim must have fainted on that one. Everything from vaudeville to hillbilly to jazz was covered.

  The ten-plus hours of shows here will keep you busy for a while- you can also watch them with ""Muppet Morsel"" subtitles. A brief but witty ""pitch"", created by Henson with assistance from ""Laugh-In""'s George Schlatter, is also included, as is the pilot, which featured rough versions of the familiar bits but had Nigel the orchestra leader (!) as host. Even the discs themselves have lovely pictures of Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo on them!

  If you love The Muppets, don't you dare miss this. If you haven't seen them in a while (like me), you're in for a real treat. And if you want to introduce them to a new generation of kids (or adults), what are you waiting for? Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy, Rowlf and all the rest- they're Muppetational!",1124928000,,3530,4.788778877887789
2323429,3,B0009ULBGS,"Ahh, yes... nostalgia. When I was a kid I would watch The Muppet Show and laugh and laugh and laugh. Now, as an adult, I find myself again laughing and laughing and laughing. The weirder part is, the stuff I'm laughing at doesn't seem to be the same things I remember laughing at as a kid.

The Muppet Show Season One comes with twenty-four episodes, plus the original pilot, a pitch reel, a promo gag reel, and my personal favorite part, ""Muppet Morsels"" mode. Muppet Morsels mode is kind of like the old VH1 television show ""Pop-Up Video"" that gives you interesting facts and points out errors that a lot of people wouldn't otherwise have caught. I found myself a lot of times reading what a fact said, then having to go back just to see what it said. There's a lot of things like ""Look! There's Jim Henson's head in the background. Oops!"" or the running count of the number of times Miss Piggy karate chopped someone. It's really a cool feature.

I think I actually prefer the on-screen commentary vs a separate audio track for commentary. When you have a secondary audio being played over top of the screen, a lot of the time it's hard for me to follow along with what's going on because it's hard to make out the dialogue sometimes. I'd always find myself watching commentaries with subtitles on, so this is an easier, more convenient way for me to do this. I am a fan of both methods of commentary, but I am thinking it is a better way to have it pop up onto the screen for you to read.

Another feature I would have liked to have seen would be a separate video angle from the performers perspective. As an adult, I now realize that Muppets aren't actually real, which is something I didn't seem to get when I was five years old sitting in front of the TV watching Big Bird talk about Snuffy on Sesame Street. With that being said, it would really be cool that if any kind of video footage exists of the under the stage performers, they should try to integrate that into the releases of the remaining seasons of the show.

When it came down to the actual shows, I found a lot of the performances by the guest stars to really be dated, but that's to be expected since the shows were originally aired almost thirty years prior. For the most part though, the Muppet-exclusive performances still stand the test of time. One of the things I learned after getting this set was there were skits created exclusively for the United Kingdom. I'm not sure why they actually did this, but it could be due to the requirement of having to fill time that would otherwise be filled with commercials here in the United States.

My favorite skits out of the entire season were: Mahna Mahna (Episode 1), all of the Swedish Chef skits, as well as the facts I'd learned about them, the Fozzie Bear heckling. My favorite episode overall would probably be the Bruce Forsyth episode (#13).

The Muppet Show Season One is a buy. I loved it all, despite the amount of time it took me to watch the entire four disc set.",1124755200,4,2998,4.422101449275362
2323430,2,B0009ULBGS,"Maybe after I take some time to watch the whole set I'll feel better about this, but right now all I feel is ripped off.

I watched this show with my daughter when it first aired. She was 6 at the time. I bought Season 1, looking forward to watching it with *her* daughter. I was especially looking forward to seeing the episode with Charles Aznavour. I had fond memories of him singing Dance In the Old Fashioned Way to Miss Piggy, although I could be wrong, because for some reason, that segment of the show seems to have been replaced by a band singing Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor On the Bedpost Over Night?

*Not* what I was expecting, and if I'd known the sequence was going to be cut, (leaving me to wonder what else may have been cut) I'd have saved my money and bought King Kong in the fall.

As far as I'm concerned, this was a disappointment.",1124668800,28,862,4.2439024390243905
2323431,4,B0009ULBGS,"First, the actual Muppet episodes are just as good as they were when first broadcast, almost thirty years ago now.  And it is great to watch the first season and see the characters develop before your eyes (Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Fozzie were to look and behave considerably different before the show ended, five years later.)

The video comments on the episodes are nice, but I am very sorry to hear that certain musical numbers have been deleted to save money on rights payments.

But my biggest complaint is that the MS is basically a musical variety show and we all have certain numbers that we love and would want to watch over and over again.  This set makes it very difficult, because the episodes have no chapter stops, none at all.  The previous release by Time-Life of about a third of the episodes were far from ideal, but they did include about half a dozen chapter stops in each episode, so you could quickly access and watch your favorite bits.

I am annoyed that they didn't bother to include chapter stops, the cost of which would have practically nothing, but they did see fit to put in an annoying ""coming attractions"" feature, which starts off the disc play and which you have to override every single time to go straight to the episodes.",1124582400,17,1255,4.580357142857143

I could go on and on about what features are on what disk, and what the special features are, and how good it all looks on DVD, but most of the other reviewers have already done that -- some in excruciating detail.  They're all completely right, of course, but that's not the point.

If you remember watching this as a kid, you'll love it.  You'll see episodes and be able to sing along like you'd just seen it yesterday.  You'll laugh at the gags like you've just seen it for the first time.  Your kids will love it just as much as you did (and still do).  And THAT'S what makes this a five-star, must-have set.

You'll thank yourself when you pick this up.",1124496000,4,713,4.222222222222222
2323433,5,B0009ULBGS,"I'm gushing over with praise for this set!

Honestly, I've been waiting so long for a proper Muppets collection, and have suffered so many disappointments with earlier releases, that I didn't get my hopes up.  After buying one of the recent ""Best Of"" sets with only three episodes a pop, I was expecting something overpriced and cheap, and I'm thrilled to the dickens to find that I was wrong!

The transfer and menus?  Great, no complaints.

- I'm really impressed with the image and sound quality, as most other shows from that decade weren't really preserved well.

- The menu is easy to navigate, and isn't obnoxious.  No need to stare at the screen to figure out what selection you have highlighted, and no need to filter through endless screens to find the episode you want to watch.

The Bonus materials?  The best part of the whole shebang!

- The pitch featurette on disc 4 is a must see for any Jim Henson fan, and I'm thrilled it still exists!

- Here's where I start to gush, this was my favorite part:  Love the information you get in commentaries, but hate having the whole episode cluttered with chatter?  Here we have the perfect solution with a pop-up video style info tidbit feature!  Turn this on and all sorts of cool facts about the episodes pop up in the appropriate places!  No more rambling and directionless reminiscing by 5 different people talking over each other in the commentaries, just cool, unobtrusive Muppet facts and fun!  They give you a mix of behind the scenes tidbits, like when you can see one of the Muppetiers in the shots, info on the guest stars, which is nice since many of them would be considered obscure today, and a jumble of other cool random facts.  I was really concerned that the episodes wouldn't appeal to me the same way they did when I was little, but this feature took care of that concern all by itself. I love this above all the other features, it's totally unique and I hope other sets pick up on the idea and run with it!

I've seen a couple of posts complain about the order of the episodes, mentioning that Scooter's character is officially introduced after a first appearance in an earlier episode.  They explain the reason for this when you turn on the Muppet Morsels feature, where you learn when the episodes were recorded and when they were first aired.  I think they tried to keep the order to when they were actually recorded.

Long story short, they really took their time, thought it through, and delivered with this DVD set.  You can tell that a lot of consideration and time went into preparing the entire set, and brilliant legacy of Jim Henson deserves no less.",1124409600,13,2638,4.5799573560767595

Now I can get my revenge with Season One of the Muppet Show and force these episode onto the family television.

I was afraid that these episodes would not meet my more mature expectations, but I'm happy to report that this is not the case.  Even these early episodes of the Muppet Show are great.  The modus operandi of these show is much like a vaudeville

show, with some glimpses into the backstage.  Kermit remains one of the greatest television hosts of all time (even against many flesh and blood counterparts).

Some of the shows in this set are a little primitive.  It's rather jarring to hear Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy with different voices in the first few episodes.  Additionally, the guest stars of each episode make sparse appearances (althought this is a good thing for a few of the episodes).  Still, your enjoyment of the episode with probably roughly correspond with that episode's particular guest star (Vincent Price is my favorite).  We'll see better shows in later season sets, but this is still a great buy with pleny of rewatchability.",1124150400,5,1237,4.702325581395349
2323436,4,B0009ULBGS,"The Muppet Show's first season is a very good season. Not super, not excellent, not even great. The first few episodes are rather annoying to watch, some of the charachters (eg- Miss Piggy) have different voices, many of the jokes include terrible puns, but once you hit disc 3 and disc 4 things get better.

I must say to the original creators of the show, being a musical theater fan, I loved your choice of guest stars and muiscal numbers. (Valerie Harper sings Sondheim's ""Broadway Baby"", Joel Grey sings two Kander and Ebb tunes, Ben Vereen sings ""Mr. Cellophane"",  and to put the icing on the cake, a whole episode is devoted to Ethel Merman.) To think the general public actually liked these stars back in the day is wonderful. If only they would now.

The DVD packaging is in the style of the average box set, ""The Simpsons"", (not including Season 6), ""The OC"", ""Family Guy"", the DVD holder goes into another box. But what is rather nice is that the cover of the first box is soft, it is meant to feel like Kermit's skin. Yes, it won't last long, but for the time being it is nice.

The special features are scarce. The pilot episode wasn't especially good. The pitch reel lasted 4 minutes. However, the Mupppet Morsell subtitles are as good as any documentary.

2323439,5,B0009ULBGS,"Now that I have the season one DVD set I can give you low down on this sensational collection. I won't go much into the episodes themselves since there are plenty of episode lists for you already. Suffice it to say there are some gems on this DVD. Also the extras are delightful.

The episodes look very clean and the audio is well balanced. I don't recall whether or not the show was remastered for this DVD set, but I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest. It really looks like you are watching the shows for the time in all their pristine glory.

This being the first season you will notice a few differences to the later seasons like how Fozzy Bear and Miss Piggy look and how Janice and some other characters sound. I kinda like seeing the earlier processes and how they evolve later on. Also there seems to be more of an irreverent charm in these episodes as well (then again I think the Muppets have always been like that). If you ever watched the Muppets you know that while you get some great comedy and wit most of the time there are those moments that seem dry. Considering these eps were done in the mid-70's that dryness might show up even more with dated material. Trust me, there is still PLENTY of fun content even if you feel the variety show format is old.

The episodes are great and I'm very happy to own them, but the extras you get really stand out as something really special and entertaining too. My personal favorite is the pitch reel Jim Henson used to sell the show to the TV executives. It's a riot! It shows just how clever and daring the show can be. The reel even takes jabs at the very execs Henson is trying to win over. Classic!! The pilot episode is another treat as well. The pacing of the pilot is a lot like Cartoon Network's ROBOT CHICKEN with very fast cuts between gags. I like the differences between the pilot and actual show like Kermit having a cameo appearance instead of being the host and how Sam the Eagle had a bigger and more laid back role in the show.

The other extras are great as well. There is a ""gag"" reel that seems more like commercial spots for early episodes, but their are fun to watch anyway. The Fun Facts is essentially a subtitle track (with an occasional splash of Kermit on the screen) you can have play on the episodes that give you TONS of information about the show, the current episode, and more. The Fun Facts are as informative and interesting as the best director or cast commentaries you can come up with from any DVD anywhere. It's that good.

The DVD set itself is put in an interesting DVD case that supposedly simulates Kermit's muppet skin. I don't think it's actual felt but it's a really neat design none the less. The 4 DVDs are kinda squished together within what would normally be a 2 DVD case by having two DVDs overlap each other. It's a neat design, however getting at disk 2 or 4 means you have to take out disk 1 or 3 to get to them. Small price to pay for a space-saving design.

Here's the deal. If you're a fan of The Muppet Show this DVD set is essential. You get a lot of good content for the price. The quality of this DVD set is excellent. It definitely beats out those ""Best of The Muppets"" DVDs we have had to endure all this time (incomplete, lacking extras, etc). You like the Muppets? GET THIS DVD.

2323446,5,B0009ULBGS,"Humor in whatever form it takes has a universal appeal. The Muppets had to work hard for their laughs. Not because they weren't funny but because nobody was really interested in a comedy aimed at adults and children with furry Muppets. When the show premiered in America in 1976, it caught on quickly with its audience delighting both adults and children. What's fascinating is that the show had a hard time attracting guest stars during its first season. After Rudolf Nureyev appeared all of that changed but during the first season Henson and his staff would have to rely on friends in the entertainment business to be guest stars in this bizarre variety show.

What's amazing is how well this show has aged. Despite some references to events that are nearly thirty years old, ""The Muppet Show"" remakes funny because of its combination of the absurd and everyday. That along with talking Muppets channeling the surreal world of The Marx Brothers allowed ""The Muppet Show"" to transcend children's programming and appeal to a universal audience.

""The Muppet Show"" was shot on videotape in the mid-70's so it's no surprise that the show looks soft and the colors aren't as vibrant as they should be but the show looks very good overall. The image quality is fairly consistent throughout.""The Muppet Show"" looks, for the most part, pretty good given the age of the source material. The mono sound has been beefed up a bit but, aside from that, it appears au natural.

No retrospective featurettes or new interviews with people like Frank Oz but we do get one of the pilots made for the series that was never aired. Evidently there were two pilots one of them being ""The Muppet's Valentine Special"" and the pilot entitled ""Sex and Violence"" (since it's the Muppets you know that it has absolutely nothing to do with pointless sex and violence) is included here. What's surprising is that Kermit doesn't host the pilot. He does appear briefly with a prototype for Miss Piggy promising her a job on an ""educational program"".  Hopefully we'll get the second pilot with the second season set. We also get a first season promo gag reel and, more importantly, Jim Henson's original pitch reel. Interestingly, Floyd, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, Astoria and the chef (and even Bert and Ernie who appeared as ""guests"" in one episode appear) and other characters are here but the show is hosted by Nigel a nondescript Muppet that doesn't have half the personality of Kermit. It's clever, funny by the end. This isn't an extra exactly but we do get the songs and short sketches that were aired in the BBC but not in America. The BBC aired the show without commercials and, as a result, the BBC episodes run longer than the US versions by about 3 to 4 minutes. So we are truly seeing these uncut for the first time in the U.S. with the original British segments intact.

Perhaps Disney will include the segments shot for Germany and other countries that appeared only overseas as extras for the next set.

We get a trivia filled text commentary referred to as ""Muppet Morsels"" which features all sorts of unusual facts about the Muppets and the various shows. While it can't possibly replace a true commentary track (I'd love to hear Frank Oz or one of the other writers/producers do a commentary track with behind-the-scenes information), it's a pretty good compromise. They could do without the question marks that appear on the screen along with the stars and everything else. I could have done without some of the question marks and stars that appear during some of the text commentaries. I would have liked to see a featurette on Jim Henson and other key Muppet operators.

Disney has done a very good job with the first season of ""The Muppet Show"". The show looks surprisingly spry on DVD given the age of the original videotapes. Truly Jim Henson and his collaborators were comedic geniuses and the lasting testament to that is this very funny variety show that captures this classic series in its formative years.",1123632000,36,3999,4.78695652173913

The slapstick comedy reminds me of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Mr. Bean and Walace and Gromit.  These DVDs keep me amused for hours.  Even my 6year old stepdaughter loves the shows and she is a hard critic to please.

2323451,5,B0009ULBGS,"Occasionally when you pick up a favorite television show that you adored growing up and watch it again through the eyes of an adult you can, more often than not, be dissapointed in what in your foggy childhood memories can remember.  And you usually end up crushed.  Or even worse, when the company releasing the DVD's don't honor the series, or the fans, and give them a so-so product with no extras worth spitting (Universal Studios take note).

This is not the case for ""The Muppet Show-season one""  I just recieved this set as a gift, and much like a good book, I just couldn't turn it off.  ""Just one more episode... and then I'll go to bed!"" I kept on saying to myself, but nixing on my own promise and watched more and more episodes instead.

And one of the reasons why I didn't live up to my promise of getting decent sleep is that I decided to turn on the Muppet Morsels after watching a few shows.  In which during the episode a ""pop-up videoesque"" information appears through out the show, letting you know more about the Muppets and their orgins, that particular episode, its stars and little tid-bits and mistakes that are in the show...

I have been waiting for this DVD set to come out for sometime now.. and I have to say, that I am far from dissapointed.  It was given to me as a gift, but I can't wait to show ""The Muppet Show"" to my two year old son.  One might think that the show might be a bit dated, but good entertainment is never out of style.",1123545600,5,1468,4.305454545454546
2323452,4,B0009ULBGS,"I think it's a wonderful thing that Disney is releasing these sets, but there are some bizarre scene omissions and DVD programming oversights that the Time-Life series actually got right, even though they were incomplete.  The episodes do not have scene selections per episode, so you can't go back and forth between skits and musical numbers, which for a variety show would be great (and was a good feature on the Time-Life DVDs).  Hopefully this will be corrected in future DVD sets.  Also, they decided to include the UK skits, which many purists will be happy about, but completely ignored the value of the DVD format's Special Features capabilities by not including the alternate skits at all!  I don't know if it was because of rights clearance or what, but come on!  If you are going to take so long to release these programs, at least do it right using the technology!  The sound and picture quality is top-notch however.  One last thing - I don't know who chose the episode order on the DVDs, but it's odd that Scooter is in a couple of episodes before the one where his character is introduced in a very specific scene.",1123545600,7,1129,4.64321608040201

My three-year-old loves it. She calls Miss Piggy ""the fancy pig"" and is already learning the theme song. It seems like TV shows today are for kids or adults, but not both. Finally we have something we can all enjoy. And my daughter is finally going to see who Kermit the Frog is. (He's not on Sesame Street any more and it's gone so far downhill, I don't let her watch it anyway.) There are no previews of upcoming attractions or videos to buy that you are forced to watch. In the menu, you can select some previews to watch if you wish. The sound seems a bit ""tinny"" but you get used to it and after 30 years, what can you expect? There are also Muppet nuggets with behind-the-scene stuff and trivia; Jim Henson's original pitch for the show; and the show's pilot. The box is really nice. It has a fuzzy Kermit on the front. It also comes with a flyer that tells which episodes are on which DVD and a coupon for a $5 rebate if you buy this along with Muppet Wizard of Oz. Enough of this.

2323456,5,B0009ULBGS,"For those who care:

The original first season opening credits are on these episodes.  Zoot does play his sax over the end credits, but it's been refilmed and is not the same footage as when the shows were originally aired.  And the pilot on the discs is ""Sex and Violence"", not the Valentine show.  Here's hoping Disney puts Valentine on the second season set!

All in all, Disney did a great job with this set.  It has enough on it to satisfy all but the most anal muppet completists.

One complaint -- the box set's cover is made with a fuzzy cloth to mimic the texture of Kermit's skin.  While this is a really cute gimmick, it's impractical -- I've had the DVDs out of plastic for only a few hours now and it's already looking a little frayed.  For something that is so obviously a keepsake, it seems silly to make it out of a material that will age so badly.",1123113600,16,864,4.283950617283951
2323457,5,B0009ULBGS,"Perhaps an Urban Legend, but it captures my sentiments about this show:

The Muppet Show originally aired during an evening/prime time slot in Great Britain.  Programming directors at BBC decided the bright, fluffy characters made it a show for children, and decided to move it to an afternoon time slot for after-school viewing.  Enraged, laborers staged a massive walk-out so they could go home and watch the show.  This ""strike"" eventually forced BBC to move the show back to its original, evening schedule.

I can't vouch for this tale's veracity, but it certainly is believable.  This show is a treasure trove of good, clean, family fun.  The magic of The Muppet Show is that it appeals to kids of all ages, from 3 to 103.  Regardless of who you are, your social status, ethnic background... there is a character on this show each of us can related to, and it brings us all together with the common bonds of laughter.

I am so glad this is finally available on DVD.  I can't wait to share it with my kids.",1123113600,5,1010,4.592178770949721

2323460,5,B0009ULBGS,"One of my childhood favorites, The Muppet Show has undying appeal to kids of all ages. Having the episodes sorted by seasons rather than ""Best Of"" collections, this is indispensable for fans of the show. With rare behind-the-scenes footage and the original pilot, this looks like a really impressive box set. Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear (Voiced by the late Jim Henson and veteran Frank 'Yoda' Oz, respectively) joined by an apparently never-ending cast of penguins, alligators with sunglasses and whatevers, Muppets ran for several seasons from the 70s to early 80s, and under the steady hand of the much-missed Henson, became one of the most witty, laugh-out loud funny and most cleverly-written TV shows in history. Richard Hunt, Dave Goelz and Jerry Nelson brought to life such unforgettable characters like Gonzo, Beeker and Crazy Harry. Sam Pottle's memorable theme song, Jerry Juhl's sharp writing and some of the most popular celebrities in the 1980s making appearances on the show, this is a crucial chapter in TV comedy history.
