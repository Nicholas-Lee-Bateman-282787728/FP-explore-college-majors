8172446,5,B000MTFFPE,"It was amazing watching this. Like most people I liked Jeff more than Matt (as they addressed in the interviews), but Matt's interview was my favorite. I do highly recommend this DVD set.",1439683200,,187,4.696969696969697
8172447,3,B000MTFFPE,Bought this thinking it would give me a better look/understanding of the hardys and it somewhat delivered that. For the most part the interviews are in depth and great but they are old interviews and everything is dated. Not a the best buy i've ever made but not the worst either.,1357171200,,280,4.509803921568627
8172448,5,B000MTFFPE,This is very interesting. Learned some stuff about the Matt and Jeff Hardy that I did not know before.,1251936000,2,102,4.421052631578948
8172449,4,B000MTFFPE,These videos are interesting but I don't know if I will let my son watch them till he gets older because of the language.  Thanks for the quick delivery I have enjoyed watching them.,1234569600,2,182,4.352941176470588
