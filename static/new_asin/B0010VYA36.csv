8238720,4,B0010VYA36,"I bought this DVD for a riding buddy who was having cabin fever.  The only problem, it made it worse!  Now he wants to buy a Dual Sport and start doing some adventure riding!",1265932800,,174,4.088235294117647
8238721,1,B0010VYA36,"Having just finished watching the Long Way Round video set (excellent), this was an extreme letdown.  It was more of an infomercial for Globeriders, documenting the travel of a group of nobodys, with nothing insightful to say.  Not much scenery, not very well narrated.  Very dissapointed with this purchase.",1234483200,4,308,5.244897959183674
8238722,3,B0010VYA36,"The technical quality is just right for this type of ""video"". It is realistic. I learned a lot, that I really don't need to know.

Where is the driving ?  Where were the problems, and mad cows.

I have no doubt that the trip was fantastic, but the film presents it as package tour with few flaws.

I'm sure that many will drool over the route and the trip, I'm still looking for the ride.

Informative, technically ok, worth the money. Keep expecting the Shell commercial to crop up. I felt no tingle, or otherwise tantalizing sensation. I'm a cultural slob who considers Grateful Dead an opera performance.. I love the ride, not the history.

So, this could be just what the doctor ordered for someone else. It's probably a safe present for any biker.

I'm still looking for the ultimate ride.",1224979200,4,794,4.549295774647887
8238723,4,B0010VYA36,"Even though the scenery and filming was excellent, I give this video only 4 stars because some of the scenes (not riding, of course) get a little long and drawn out.  I do know it is about the cultures too, and so it is one of my favorites.  Am I too selfish if I want my m/c videos to have 90% riding?",1221523200,2,302,3.8548387096774195
