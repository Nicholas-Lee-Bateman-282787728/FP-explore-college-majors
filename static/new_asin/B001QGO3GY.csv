8509556,1,B001QGO3GY,"I read on the internet the killers were going to put out a dvd this year and I bought this dvd thinking this was it, but it is not (or at least I hope it isn't).  It isn't even authorized by them nor does it contain any orginal music by the killers.  In fact it seems to be a repackaging of the Leaving Las Vegas dvd.  The first five minutes has the same intro.  I was so disappointed I didn't watch anymore than that.  I love the killers and the rating no way reflects on them or their music.  Don't waste your money, especially if you already have the Leaving Las Vegas dvd (read the reviews for it if you don't).",1244678400,11,615,4.041322314049586
