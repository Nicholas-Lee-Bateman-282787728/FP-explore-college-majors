1359139,5,B00004W1A9,"Joyce's ULYSSES is one of the great works of literature of this century -- it is also a difficult novel to read.  Most readers need help and there are various guidebooks available for this.  Another way of accessing the novel  is by listening to oral interpretations of it on  tape or record or by  watching Strick's excellent film tribute to the book.  Of course, it could  not be possible to get that whole massive work into a couple of hours film  -- I doubt that Strick ever intended to.  But this film is an excellent  introduction to the book, one that I would recommend warmly.",923616000,27,584,4.476190476190476
1359140,5,B00004W1A9,"I first saw this movie in Manhattan in 1969. I followed it through the art theaters and saw it 4 times all together. I have long wanted to see it again and it was worth the wait having discovered it on Amazon.com. I highly recommend the movie. It is filmed in black and white which I think enhances it. It is not a substitute for reading James Joyce's 'Ulysses'. I also recommend reading the book in its entirety even if it presents a challange. Perhaps the high light of the movie is the last 20 minutes devoted to scenes and images over laid on the sound track of Molly Bloom delivering her famous soliloquy, some of the best writing in the English language.",1265846400,,660,4.373983739837398
1359141,4,B00004W1A9,"I owned this film on video and then purchased the DVD when it became available.  The DVD has not been enhanced and the picture quality is not great.  However, I think it is still worth  buying for the quality of the acting performances - Milo O'Shea IS Bloom - and the fact that it is filmed on location in Dublin - although some of the scenes are not placed in the original Joyce locations. It is of course a seriously curtailed  version of the novel - it would have to be to fit into two hours - and does not in any way substitute for a reading of the original. Much of the symbolism and historical references of the inner dialogue cannot be transferred onto the screen but I think the film can be a great aid to anyone reading the novel for the first time.

The best scene in my opinion is the Cyclopes episode where Bloom confronts the citizen - it is an excellent representation of Joyce's narrative and a valid interpretation of his elaborate imagery.",1181347200,3,957,4.353932584269663
1359142,5,B00004W1A9,This old movie is a classic.  True to the book.  This is a great companion to the book.  I recommend it to anyone that cares to see some of the book come to life.,1178496000,,162,3.7058823529411766
1359143,4,B00004W1A9,"I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I saw it when it first came out and it was over my head. Generally the book is considered the most challenging English languague novels,but the movie was fun.

It did have that strange Modernist lack of linearity that is not

always easy to grasp. And in some ways it reminded me of the visual presentaion of ""The Trial"" by Orson Welles, although much more upbeat.

The Anti Semitism was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, but Bloom was an excellent character as was his wife Molly. And you could feel some people really loved the irascible character. Deadulus (the Joyce double) wasn't as fully developed, but was still effective.

The ability to visualize stream of cosciousness writing is

nearly impossible for an extended length of time, but it was a nice try. And the various omniscent narrions, while being a little too film noirish, were still effective; particularly

Leoplod's and Molly's which took up nearly half the film.

This is definitely not for everyone, but if you want to know the general points of this monumental work- and laugh a little-

Ulysses is definitely worth your time. Maybe next I'll try the book.

(ps some of the automobiles were much too modern for the time the film took place- nobody's perfect).",1152921600,3,1297,4.70353982300885
1359144,3,B00004W1A9,"The James Joyce book Ulysses is an odd one, perhaps the oddest book ever written.  Its language can't be copied in a film.  If it were, nobody would understand the movie.  When I read Ulysses I had the Cliff Notes right by me, so I would have some idea what was going on.  If you have never read the book, you can't know what I'm talking about.  Browse it in a library and you will see.  Then try telling me what language it is written in, because I don't know.

I liked the book very much even though I couldn't come anywhere near understanding it without the Cliff Notes.  As for the movie version, don't be afraid.  James Joyce did not write the screen play.  It was written in English and you'll do just fine.

The story is about a Jewish man in Ireland named Leopold Bloom.  He's really a funny guy.  He is a sick puppy though.  He gets a sexual thrill out of the idea of his beloved wife Molly having sex with other men.  He himself hasn't had sex with her in over ten years, ever since their baby died in infancy.

It's a heartbreaking story because Leo (Poldy, to his wife), and Molly are deeply in love with each other.  Meanwhile she is cheating on him with her employer Blazes Boylan, who has just made love to her seven times in one day.  You get angry at her for betraying our friend Leo Bloom until you realize that she is fully convinced that he is cheating on her, and has seen pretty convincing evidence of it.  Even with all her cheating, she is jealous regarding her man.  He's not, by the way.  He could be, easily enough, but he's not.

Leo and Molly are unforgettable characters.  One of my strongest memories of them is from when they were first dating, and he bought her a little cake, and she chewed it all up into a wet ball, took it out of her mouth, and stuck it in his.  He swallowed it.  What a silly man he is.

Then there is the time when he returned home to her at night, knowing that she just spent the entire day in his own bed having sex with Blazes Boylan, and, thinking she was asleep, he kissed her backside.  What a man!  What a silly man.

One problem with the film is a problem shared with the book.  Some scenes just go on soooo long.  Watch it, particularly the last hour of it, and you will see what I mean.",1128556800,6,2252,4.155452436194896
1359145,4,B00004W1A9,"The film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses was quite appropriate at the time it was released, 1967, 45 years after the release of the book.  The novel was the most controversial and complex books of the 20th century, which involved issues of religion, sexuality, and self as it pertained to Joyce's own life. Joseph Strick attempts to interpret these core issues with the three main characters in the novel, Leopold Bloom (Milo O'Shea), Stephen Dedalus (Maurice Roeves), and Molly Bloom (Barbara Jefford).  Indeed, the film reflects the Sixties with its emphasis of ""free love,"" but not without the messiness that comes along with it.  The most interesting aspect of the film shows the intelligently done Molly Bloom segment that occupies, roughly, the last 45 minutes of the film.

The cinematography is quite good.  Had the film been filmed in color than in black and white, the scenes may not have been effective in conveying parts of the book.  Strick does a fine job in capturing the Irish landscape with a postcard-like quality.  On a critical note, the film could have received an Ingmar Bergman treatment because the novel/film involves the intricacies of religion and the human condition.  However, if Joyce intended to present a humorous narrative, this film accomplishes his intentions.

Overall, Ulysses offers segments of the novel that will help one understand and visualize its main premise.  It is not recommended to replace the reading of the actual novel, but rather to supplement it.  The movie as well as the novel will be a challenge.",1125273600,11,1557,5.04296875
1359146,5,B00004W1A9,"If a movie could do justice to Molly Bloom, this is it.

If a movie could skip the chapter ""Nausicaa"" and yet capture the longing inside Joyce's characters, the ruin of old Irish castles, the striving of Stephen Dedalus and the trippy wonder of the brothel where Dedalus and Mr. Bloom come together in a kind of mini-Gotterdammerung, this movie is it.",1102464000,6,351,4.661290322580645
1359147,2,B00004W1A9,"Joseph Strick's Summer of Love version of Ulysses is a film that bursts with some its era's most iconic cinematic hallmarks: intellectual abstraction, Sellers-like comedy, dated provocation, and some Angry Young Man `moody-broody'-ness.  But it's also based on what I - and many others - regard as the finest novel of the century, and perhaps of all time. Having mounted such a story with an unpracticed director and an unknown cast, the producers delivered a film that's dated badly, and proves largely of its time.
It is not without virtues, though, for Joyceans and otherwise. It was filmed, in luscious black and white, on location, but no effort was made to hide the relative modernity of 1967 Dublin and the post-Victorian trappings of the setting are limited to Milo O'Shea's hat. That fact alone makes the film interesting. It also boasts some amusing directorial asides courtesy of talented dilettante Strick, such as the very subtle insertion of Joyce's headlines into the newspaper scene.
Many of the performances are good, and some are indelible: Milo O'Shea is vulnerable, attractive, awkward, comic, tragic, and sometimes simply naturalistic in a tour de force performance that deserved an Oscar and remains his greatest-ever screen showing. To say nothing of his eyebrows, which spread more joy than Molly Bloom's behind. As well, TP McKenna is wonderful as a puckish, hedonistic Buck Mulligan. But most of the cast are too old for the roles they've taken, and some come off poorly, in particular a lead-footed Maurice Roeves as Stephen Dedalus.  Joyce fans will likely enjoy a few of the setpieces - the opening in the Martello Tower is nicely handled, and the Cyclops chapter is agreeably deconstructed - but loathe others, especially the appallingly stiff Proteus monologue.
Those without any familiarity with the book will likely be lost, and while Molly Bloom's closing monologue is beautifully mounted, outside the context of the novel it has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and it's over a half hour long. The episode in the whorehouse is even longer, underscoring Strick's disagreeably prurient approach to the material. That being said, although this film was banned in Ireland until recently there's little in it that will offend contemporary tastes. This marks the first use of the F-word in a mainstream film, as far as I know, and there's some brief male nudity in the form of Mulligan's mulligan. The rest could play unedited on generally puritan US daytime TV.
In general I'd recommend that fans of sixties cinema and Joyceans see this film at least once, but I cannot in good conscience recommend Image Entertainment's insultingly sloppy (and absurdly overpriced) DVD. The picture quality and color is dreary, with chalky whites, fuzzy grays and pockmarked blacks. There is visible flicker in the top-right corner at all times, and even more pronounced flicker accompanying _every single edit_, especially early in the film. The dialogue is mono and muffled and there are no closed captions or subtitles, making the film a tough slog for those who haven't already memorized the (generally faithful) Joycean dialogue. Nor, for that matter, are there any other supplemental features, of any kind! The film is split up into huge, twenty-odd minute blocks, not useful for skipping.
Upsetting both Joyce fans and the Joyceless, Strick's Ulysses has always been a film without an audience. Image's lazy package, and $49 list price, aren't helping it find one.",1081036800,77,3493,5.115586690017513
1359148,5,B00004W1A9,"Wonderful visualization of the basic plotline. Yes, the book does have a plot. Filmed in Dublin, so you see the towers, river, and streets. The production is done with love, for those who couldn't imagine life without  this book.",946771200,18,229,4.871794871794871
7924314,5,B00004W1A9,"When you ask the hard-readers abut Joyce's Ulysses many asert it but just a few have been capable to make the whole task. Ulysses is probably one of the five works more pyramidal of the past Century.

That's why to assume the arduous challenge to make a script and translate it to the screen, and make it, taking into account the inner dreams, subtle and bittersweet reflections, and feature the existential perspective of this couple. Stephen Dedalus (The alter ego of Joyce) is described with absolute sense of fidelity respect the text.

For many movie lovers, it will be a shocking experience in case of not having read the book.

You will experience a journey to Dublin, with crucial intersections, cynical comments and peculiar irreverence so typcial of the Irish writers (Wilde and Shaw).

7924317,5,B00004W1A9,"This was a real find; I'd never heard of it. Black & white, from the late '60s, somewhat stylized. For a long time you can't tell if it's supposed to be reset in the present day, but no, it is early twentieth-century Dublin. At first it seems pretty realistic, but like the book, it gets weirder and weirder as it goes on. I'm a bit surprised it isn't better-known. Check it out.",1409529600,,379,4.277777777777778
7924318,2,B00004W1A9,"We bought this film hoping it would give us a quick introduction to Joyce's work.  We were disappointed that the sound quality was poor and the actors have strong regional British accents and don't seem to enunciate their words, so between the three issues, it was very hard to follow.  We turned it off part way through.  I think I will read the book first and perhaps take another stab at the movie.  Has anyone else made a movie of this book?",1400025600,,445,4.390243902439025

7924321,3,B00004W1A9,"James Joyce's great novel ""Ulysses"" is not so much a good story with an interesting plot as it is a profound and often hilarious literary performance of enormous complexity. The novel simply cannot be filmed, but this is an interesting try at it. The director endeavors to bring in exact dialogue and some of the spirit of Joyce's text.  I would not recommend this film (or any film, for that matter) to students trying to pretend they have read the book for a college exam! However, the final Molly Bloom interior monologue is rather well done and is quite enough to give anybody a good notion what that chapter's all about -- and it is certainly the highlight of the film.",1361404800,2,674,4.570247933884297
7924322,4,B00004W1A9,"I saw this film, the adaptation of James Joyce's most famous novel which is one of the most important and complex works of the 20th century literature, in the early 90s. The Videotape was on the shelf in the local library where I worked at the time. When I saw the title, I could not believe my eyes, and said to myself: ""This just can't happen because it is impossible."" But I held in my hands the evidence to the fact that the epitome of the unfilmable book had indeed been adapted to the screen. Even before I started watching, I was fascinated with audacity of the film's creators who were not afraid to aim a blow at the most famous literary ""stream of consciousness"" of the 20th century. The film left many parts of the books out and could not capture the whole realm of book's richness, it would be impossible, but the attempt still made me feel respect and appreciation to the film director/co-writer Joseph Strick and everyone involved for making an interesting and entertaining motion picture from the incredibly complex, versatile, polyphonic novel which is filled with the dizzying flight of thought, for which there is no limit in either space or time.

What ""Ulysses""- the film did right, it is certainly a cinematic portrait of Dublin, James Joyce's city that lives, sounds and moves during a single day, known in literature as Bloomsday, June 16, 1904. Joyce once wrote that he wanted to describe Dublin in in such way that even in hundred years if the city disappears from the face of the earth, it could be restored based on the novel ""Ulysses"". Now, in addition to the Joyce's prose, there is a movie portrait of Joyce's Dublin carefully reproduced with its streets, avenues, harbor, docks, quays, pubs, the ""red lights"" district, cathedrals, cemetery, etc. I was very impressed by Milo O 'Shea in the role of Leopold Bloom. That's how I always imagined Bloom's appearance, body language, behavior, the whole persona.

The best and most memorable are last two scenes of the film; a long surreal ""Circe"" depicting Bloom's and Stephen Daedalus visit to a brothel, and of course, the culmination of the film and the novel, 'Penelope'. Molly Bloom, Barbara Jefford, caught on a thin line between waking and dreaming just the moments before she falls asleep, thinks about very intimate events in her life, recent and long gone. She reminisces about her and Bloom's present and past and finally falls asleep with the most beautiful and life affirming thoughts ever captured in English language: ""...I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes."" Molly's inner monologue takes almost 30 minutes in the film but it is rich, playful, feminine, wave-like spiral and soothing. It is so beautiful, and Jefford made it her own yet relating to any viewer regardless of gender that I could listen to it again and again.

In my opinion, ""Ulysses"" (1967) adapted by Joseph Strick is interesting, even if not completely successful film experiment, which was awarded the Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. Incidentally, I have quite a seditious idea that ""Ulysses"" has been successfully transferred to the screen and the film has turned out amazingly captivating, entertaining and profound. He has another title and is the adaptation of another work of literature. I mean the posthumous Stanley Kubrick's film, his swan song ""Eyes Wide Shut."" But this is a topic for another review.",1334102400,2,3836,4.663220088626293
7924323,3,B00004W1A9,"The three stars is for the transfer. I like the movie. This is the first time I've seen it since its release in the sixties.
