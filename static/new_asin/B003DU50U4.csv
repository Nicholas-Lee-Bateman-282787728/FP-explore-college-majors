4112130,4,B003DU50U4,"When I was a kid, I loved to watch Scooby Doo in syndication. There was nothing better than sitting down with a bowl of cocoa puffs and waiting for that crazy dog to grace my tv screen. My favorite series? The 13 Ghost of Scooby Doo of course! It was something rare to see Cartoon Network play this particular series much though, considering there were atleast 5 other incarnations of Scooby to choose from, but when they would show it, I was ecstatic!

How has it held up over the years? Wonderfully! I just finished watching my set earlier this morning, and nostalgia has set in, and I am in awe. Let's do an episode run down.

1x01 - To All the Ghouls I've Loved Before - Scooby and his pals crash in the a creepy town where 2 ghost await their arrival.

1x02 - Scoobra Kaboobra - In this episode, the gang must face an evil warlock who is bent on discovering a magical wand to give him infinite magic.

1x03 - Me and My Shadow Demon - This particular episode is one of my favorites. Queen Morbidia is throwing a party, and of course she wants the chest, so why not trap the gang in an infinite maze?

1x04 - Reflections in a Ghoulish Eye - The gang must travel to an Arabian villiage to expel a demon from a haunted mirror.

1x05 - That's Monstertainment - Zomba the red fleshed demon decides that she'll trap the gang in an old black and white movie to obtain the chest.

1x06 - Ship of Ghouls - Poor Scooby is so scared now, that the gang decided to take him on a cruise. Unbeknownst to them, the cruise is ran by ghosts, and they're heading to the Bermuda triangle!

1x07 - A Spooky Little Ghoul Like You - Vincent Van Ghoul has won the most coveted Warlock award known, but a certain Demonstress wants his magic, so she puts him in a love trance. Cant the gang save him in time?

1x08 - When You Witch Upon a Star - Marcella, a demon wind wants to be flesh again, so she recruits 3 idiot witches to help her, the gang can outsmart the 3, but can they outsmart Marcella?

1x09 - It's A Wonderful Scoob - How will the team fare against a ghost who can control time? What would life be like if Scooby quit the team? Watch and see!

1x10 - Scooby in KwackyLand - Yet another demon is after the chest, but how will the gang save it if they're trapped in a comic strip?

1x11 - Coast to Ghost - Ol' Vince is turning to stone, how can the gang save him? By teaming up with Bogel and Weird to get half way across the US to obtain a special mask!

1x12 - The Ghouliest Show on Earth - Scooby and the gang need a break, so they head back to Scooby's home town, little do they know, an evil circus has risen!

1x13 - Horror-scope Scoob - The finale! How can the gang stop the most powerful demon from stealing the chest? They may not!

Characters

Scooby - Our hungry hero who unexpectedly opens the chest releasing the spirits.
Shaggy - Scooby's owner, who is almost as dimwitted as Scooby!
Scrappy - Scooby's nephew, the mean bulldog stuck inside a pup's body! He's itchin to start a fight!
Daphne - The only sane person of the core 4, and the only female to boot.
FlimFlam - The fast talking, pint sized con artist.
Vincent Van Ghoul - Voiced by Vincent Price, he's the warlock that helps the team (Ala Charlie from Charlie's Angels)
Bogel and Weird - 2 idiot ghosts that try to foil the plans of the team.

DVD Set

The set is a nice one, the episodes, although grainy are in great shape. They have included subtitles and other languages also. The biggest problem that I have with the set? Every episode had a small segment before the opening credits that usually showed the featured ghost. Well, with the set, some of the episodes play the credits before the short opening, while other's keep the original order. These episodes are also uncut. The only features included are a video game preview, and an episode of one of the new incarnations of Scooby doo.

All in all, its a great set, so don't pass up on it.",1277769600,59,3913,4.242261103633917
4112131,5,B003DU50U4,"This is the height of Scooby-Doo.  After this, everything went down hill.  I don't even like or relate to modern Scooby stuff--they're like clones walking around in my old friends' bodies.  And yes, I like Scrappy-Doo.  So this is the last of good Scooby stuff, and my favorite to boot.  They took lots of chances, veering away from the mystery format and going into light thrillers and fantasies.  And check out Flim-Flam, an Asian urchin undoubtedly inspired by Indiana Jones' Short Round, drawing me to him since I love Shorty.  The humor is outrageous, the funniest cartoons got before unfortunately veering down the path of gross-out humor.  And of course, there's that lingering hug between Daphne and Shaggy in the first episode.  I had never seen anything like it in all my Scooby watching years and it changed me forever.  Since then, I have firmly been in the Daphne/Shaggy camp and can't stand Daphne with Fred.",1275955200,5,922,4.852564102564102
4112132,4,B003DU50U4,Ive been waiting for this to come out for a long time now.  For anyone who is a diehard scooby doo lover this is a must.,1273622400,,120,3.6153846153846154
4112133,2,B003DU50U4,"I'd like to say that I liked this one.  The van got a makeover and so did Daphne.  Her hair and the jump suit that she wore were more ""80s"".  Also, Vincent Price made a nice addition to the cast as Vincent Van Ghoul.  The problem with this show, as with all of the primary ones from the eighties, is Scrappy. I fall into the camp of those who felt that he ruined the show.  And, unfortunately, Flim Flam was every bit as irritating.",1272931200,7,432,4.095238095238095
4112134,5,B003DU50U4,"Even though the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo maybe have not been my favorite Scooby Doo show it definetly deserved a DVD release and I'm glad to see to make it to DVD. Although this show doesn't have Velma or Fred they also got new characters along with the well known Scooby Doo, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Daphne. The new characters consists of Flim Flam and Vincent Van Ghoul who helped the gang with what the main plot consisted of.
  The main plot was that they were trying to put the 13 ghosts that they had released from the Chest of Demons by accident. While trying to do this two not so intelligent ghosts Weerd and Bogel get in the way and always tried to stop the gang but never really succeeded.

There were thirteen episodes produced and are listed below.

1. To All the Ghouls I've Loved Before
2. Scoobra Kadoobra
3. Me and My Shadow Demon
4. Reflections in a Ghoulish Eye
5. That's Monstertainment
6. Ship of Ghouls
7. A Spooky Little Ghoul Like You
8. When You Witch Upon A Star
9. It's A Wonderful Scoob
10. Scooby in Kwackyland
11. Coast to Ghost
12. The Ghouliest Show on Earth
13. Horror-Scope Scoob

So I'm very excited to see what else will be coming out on DVD soon. From the looks of it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Morning-Cartoons-1980s-Vol-1/dp/B0037XPPAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1980s, Vol. 1</a>will be put on DVD and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Friends-Season-One-Vol-Two/dp/B003F3NE4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Friends!: Season One, Vol. Two</a>&nbsp;will also be coming on DVD soon.

UPDATE:

I just recieved my copy of the DVD on July 16th 2010 and I was so excited. As soon as I had a chance I popped the disc out and watched the first episode. I really enjoyed it and really liked how Hanna Barbera made a sort of introduction episode to show how it all begins unlike some other shows.

The DVD itselve, I think looks good. Although it's a small thing and doesn't have any special features that actually talk about the show it still really good. I think as long as all the episodes are here then you should be happy. I really think Warner should do more DVD s like this for the shows that the don't want to spend lots of money on for a DVD release because of their worries that they won't sell good and even if they weren't the most popular shows it would still be good for the people who really enjoy then today. So yes I like the DVD and I'm happy to get to own these episodes for myself. So trust me if your having your doubts about the DVD in my opinion you should buy it.

Ok I hope my review is helpful.

I have always had Scooby and Shaggy, and certainly, the new guy Flim Flam to thank for that. Sad to say, it seems kind of get-to-the-pointish compared to the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" I think maybe they had a little too much fun with the plot lines and the comedy. But hey! It was the 80s. overall, it is not the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where are You?,"" which I have grown to like and appreciate over the years. but it's not all bad.",1492732800,2,761,5.684210526315789

4112152,5,B003DU50U4,"This series is quite entertaining, and pretty rare.  Fred and Velma are not in these episodes at all.  In a later movie, Fred mentions he was away at ""Trapping School"" during this time...LOL  Daphne looks totally different but is still voiced by Heather North.  Shaggy and Scooby are the same, as well as Scrappy Doo too.  Flim Flam is a funny character, and I could not forget to mention the infamous Vincent VanGhoul voiced by....you guessed it....... Vincent Price.  Overall, I highly recommend this series, especially if you like vintage Scooby cartoons.",1490400000,3,558,5.010869565217392

If they get rid of Weerd and Bogel and make it a little more serious like Zombie Island, then we got a great show. Still its not bad but we could of had something more.

4112174,5,B003DU50U4,I like this incarnation of Scooby Doo more than Scooby Doo Where are You? and the other series combined. I don't like the newer incarnations  of Scooby Doo. I love this one and all the characters including Scrappy and Flim Flam. I know I'll get flamed to heck and back for daring to like two of the most hated characters in the Scooby Doo franchise. I love how the Ghosts are real instead of people in costumes. I really wish this series was longer because it is very interesting. It is supposed to be dark yet it is still light hearted and corny. I like this type of cartoon. This is a series that no Scooby Doo collector can do without. I'm not sure if it even airs on boomerang anymore. The animation is extremely limited like all old Hanna Barbera cartoons. The artwork isn't as detailed as the art on the DVD cover but hopefully it will entice more would be buyers. The characters do not have shading of any kind. The acting is kind of hammy or corny take your pick but if you love cheesy good fun you can't go wrong with this series.,1473552000,,1039,4.274111675126903

4112178,3,B003DU50U4,"This is a very hard collection to review. The first seven episodes range from okay to great. Episodes 9 and 13 aren't too bad either but episodes 8,10,11, and 12 are horrendously awful. I take back what i said in a previous review about ghosts of the ancient astronauts being the worst scooby doo episode. All four bad ones on this set are ALOT worse. It is interesting having a story arc that continues from episode to episode. That does lead to some new story ideas for the first six episodes that feel fresh and unrepetitive. However, soon afterwards, we have a series more repetitive than the original series ever thought about being. I like that shaggy's and daphne's clothing were updated for this series. The series has a few great episodes. The pilot was a very engrossing start to the series but the best episode is Scoobra Kadoobra with its great animation, oneliners, gags, and overall immersement in fourth wall breaking parody supreme. Worth purchasing for a cheap price. Some classics to be found.",1463961600,,1011,4.782857142857143

4112217,5,B003DU50U4,"I am not a Scooby-Doo aficionado.  While I loved the original series as a kid like everyone else, it's way too formulaic for me now.  I've seen some episodes recently and it's not a horrible show but it's not that good either.  However, I must say that I have come to love ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" (it is like the original series except much better) and I greatly enjoy the character of Scrappy-Doo.  My favorite pre 80s Scooby-Doo cartoon was the one where he was with the whole gang.  I don't know; he just seemed to liven up the series.  While we're talking about him, why does everyone hate him?  My father and I both found him entertaining.  He said that he reminded him of the chicken hawk from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons.  I will admit that my least favorite Scooby-Doo cartoon (that I've seen, apart from A Pup Named Scooby-Doo which while it had a catchy theme song I always thought it was terrible; I know a fair many people liked it but I never did) was the one where each episode was three shorts and it just had Scrappy, Shaggy and Scooby going off on lame adventures and/or encountering real monsters that weren't very scary and just played for laughs.  Those were not very good.  But I still like the first season with him in it, and even in the bad ones he is not the reason I don't like them..  But this was the one Scooby-Doo I always valued over all the others.  It has been my favorite ever since I first saw it.  I didn't see every episode growing up as it wasn't played very often, but when I did catch an episode I knew I was in for a real treat.  I greatly enjoyed revisiting it on DVD and felt that overall it has held up quite well. In fact, I would definitely rank it as one of my top 5 Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes written by me.

1.  To All the Ghouls I've Loved Before:  Two ghosts known as Bogel and Weerd force down a plane carrying Shaggy, Daphne, Scrappy and of course Scooby-Doo in the Himalayas, so that they can trick them into opening a chest that contains the 13 most powerful ghosts ever.  Shortly after crashing, the gang meets the young con artist Flim-Flam and the elderly mystic Vincent Van Ghoul.  Despite the inevitable conclusion, I greatly enjoyed this.  It was funnier and more atmospheric than the vast majority of episodes before it.  A+

2.  Scoobra Kaboobra - The gang goes to a haunted castle in a spooky forest to take care of the first of the titular 13 ghosts, a warlock from the Dark Ages known as Maldor the Malevolent.
This was the first episode I ever saw, and after all these years it's still awesome.  Maldor is my favorite of the 13 ghosts.  He was a competent villain who went right after the heroes and gave them quite a challenge, and he's voiced by none other than Peter ""Optimus Prime"" Cullen.  The plot is surprisingly exciting too, and as usual there are some hilarious moments; my favorite being the bit with the Media Watchdog Loretta Cutitout.  A+

3.  Me and My Shadow Demon: When a shadow demon steals the chest the gang goes to Befuddled Manor to get it back, but little do they know that is just what Queen Morbidia wants.  She not only intends to trap our heroes in a maze, she wants to destroy the chest!  Another excellent episode, with some good twists and laughs.  A+

4. Reflections in a Ghoulish Eye:  The Reflector Spector sets his sights on our heroes when they attend a paranormal convention in Morocco.  This is one of my least favorite episodes.  There are some good laughs, and the Reflector Spector is pretty cool.  But a little too much time is spent on the subplot about Scooby and friends being blamed for people disappearing, and there is some terrible singing.  The songs in previous episodes weren't too bad, but Flim-Flam's song and several characters singing the New Year's Eve song were painful for me to listen to.  I would have had our heroes realize that the mirror was the key to people disappearing shortly after they were blamed, then go into it and spend most of the remaining time in the mirror world (which looked pretty neat as well).  Oh well, I've seen worse, so call it B-.

5. That's Monstertainment:  In an attempt to get the chest, Zomba has sent the whole gang into a black and white horror movie.  This is one of my favorite episodes because it was a really fun parody of monster movies.  A+

6. Ship of Ghouls:  Scooby has seen one ghost too many and needs a holiday so the gang decides to relax on a cruise ship.  But little do they know that Bogel and Weerd have ensured that they're booked on a ship where everyone is a ghost!  This is another excellent episode.  A+

7. A Spooky Little Ghoul Like You: The temptress known as Necara puts Vincent under a love spell so that she can marry him, then steal his powers with a kiss.  I enjoyed this episode except for one thing: It was Flim-Flam's fault that Vincent was put under Nicara's spell because he gave her his room number, and he was never called out on it.  Still, Nicara was a pretty good villain, and the story was both intriguing and funny.  Not one of my favorites, but pretty good.  A-

8. When You Witch Upon a Star: The ghost of a witch named Marcella may have escaped the chest but she's trapped in the evil zone.  She enlists the help of an idiot trio of witches (who are basically female versions of the Three Stooges) to cast a spell that will free her.  This is the worst episode of the series.  The 3 witches are the most annoying villains in all of Scooby-Doo.  Every time they sang that stupid song of theirs I wanted to burn my ears!  Out of all the 4 episodes without Bogel and Weerd (they were also missing in episodes 2, 3 & 5), this is the one that needed them the most as they are much better comic relief characters.  There are also several other stupid moments, like how Marcella takes out Vincent way too easily.  But this episode isn't completely awful.  Marcella was a cool villain with a great voice thanks to B.J. Ward, there were a couple laugh-out loud moments, Vincent's opening narration was great as always, and we get to see Daphne dressed as a belly dancer.  Of course, since all of the shots of her in that costume were with Shaggy dressed the same way it's debatable whether that's a plus or not.  D

9. It's A Wonderful Scoob:  Scooby succeeds in stealing the time scepter of the time manipulating ghost known as Time Slime, but he's had enough of ghosts and quits.  Will the gang be able to find a replacement for him?  And what will happen if Time Slime wins?  Now this is more like it.  This was one of my favorites as a kid, and it still is today.  Time Slime is one of the best ghost next to Maldor, and the episode itself is excellent.  There are several very funny moments, and the bleak future was actually sort of epic for Scooby-Doo.  A+

10. Scooby in KwackyLand:  The ghost known as Demondo traps Scooby and the others (minus Vincent Van Ghoul) in the comics section of the newspaper.  To escape, our heroes need the help of their favorite comic strip characters.  This was my favorite episode back in the day, and now I hold it as the best episode of any Scooby-Doo cartoon ever.  It's such a unique episode.  There are quite a few shows that have characters trapped in TV land like in That's Monstertainment (it's even a trope), but how many shows have an episode which takes place in the Sunday funnies?  I loved how the comic strips were drawn slightly different than the rest of the show.  I greatly enjoyed the comic strip characters, especially Platypus Duck.  He was so cute and funny, and the song he sang was great.  I actually hoped that he and the others got a spin-off series.  All I can say is, worse spin-offs have been greenlit (Angela Anaconda, I'm looking at you).  And to top it off Demondo is my favorite villain in this series next to Maldor and Time Slime.  If everything else sucked, the series would have been worth two stars just for this.  A+

11. Coast to Ghost:  The ghost known as Rankor has tricked Vincent into looking at the Eye of Eternity, and as a result he will turn to stone in 24 hours.  To save him, the others will have to team up with Bogel and Weerd!  Another excellent episode.  While not one of my top 5 episodes, it's definitely in my top 10 as I had no problems with it.  The framing subplot wasn't nearly as frustrating as in Reflections in a Ghoulish Eye, and Rankor was pretty cool.  Plus there were the usual great laughs.  A+

12. The Ghouliest Show on Earth:  The gang heads back to Scooby's (supposed) hometown, but when they get there they find that everyone is at a circus where everything is free.  However, there's more to this circus than meets the eye.  This is yet another excellent episode.  Professor Phantasmo is a great villain and the story has some good twists and very funny moments.  The only bad thing is that Scooby's parents are nothing like they were in ""It's a Wonderful Scoob"".  I preferred the ones in that episode, but there's a solution for this; just pretend they're his grandparents and this little plot hole is solved.  A+

13. Horror-scope Scoob:  Our heroes have been invited to guest star on a TV show, but in the middle of the show the chest disappears, and Bogel and Weerd had nothing to do with it!  Can they find the chest before anything bad happens?  I loved this episode, but it wasn't the best episode to end the series on.  Simbooroo was quite possibly the weakest of the 13 ghosts.  Despite being one of the coolest looking ghosts, the only thing he did was shapeshift.  It was also a tad disappointing that Flim Flam was the one that caught him, but those are admittedly fairly minor quibbles as there were some good twists and several very funny moments plus Daphne was shown to be quite smart in this one.  While this wasn't one of my top 5 episodes of the show, it would still rank in my top ten.  A

And now I will give my overall thoughts on the series.  As you can tell from the score card, I love it.  Like I said before, it was always my favorite Scooby-Doo cartoon, and I still hold it as the best.  Why is it my favorite?  Well for starters, it was the first Scooby-Doo with a story arc.  It had a clear goal in mind, and the fact that each episode brought them a little closer to that goal really made me want to see all of them.  There's also the fact that it's not as repetitive as the previous shows.  With this show, you really didn't know what was going to happen.  I mean sure, you knew that they were going to find a ghost, chase the ghost then catch the ghost; but you didn't know where they were going to do it at.  The varied settings and stories really stood out as a kid.  While most of the other Scooby-Doo episodes are blurred together in my memories because they're all so alike, the ones I remembered from this series still lingered strongly in my mind.  The stories themselves were quite good as well.  While a little more intense and darker than most Scooby shows, there were still many hilarious moments to be found in this series and it was very creative.  With one exception, the main cast was perfect.  Scooby and Shaggy are always fun to watch, and as you know I'm a Scrappy fan.  Vincent Van Ghoul was an awesome addition to this series, and while Daphne was just there she had her moments, and if nothing else she's always pretty to look at.  I really don't have very many problems with this show.  Flim-Flam was definitely my least favorite character, but he wasn't that bad most of the time.  In fact, I even liked him in a few episodes, like Scoobra Kadoobra and The Ghouliest Show On Earth.  While I did miss Velma, I didn't really miss Fred and characters like Vincent Van Ghoul and Scrappy helped even things out.  And it would be disappointing that this series is unfinished; except if you are willing to use your imagination, they DID catch all 13 ghosts!  One of my 2 candidates for the missing ghosts can be found in Ship of Ghouls.  I know that most people consider the Cyclops thing to be a fusion of the first 4 ghosts, but what if it wasn't?  What if one of the 13 ghosts was residing in the Bermuda Triangle, where he was at his most powerful; powerful enough to open the chest (like a couple other ghosts in this series) and absorb all the ghosts inside?  I know it's a stretch, but I'm going with it.  If they can make mistakes like Scooby having completely different sets of parents, then surely they could have forgotten to leave out that important detail?  The other ghost can be seen in A Spooky Little Ghoul Like You.  Remember the Grim Reaper figure that was performing the marriage ceremony?  I consider him one of the 13 ghosts.  Since Vincent seemed to suck several of the other ghosts into the chest, we can assume that he was one of them.  So that's it, all 13 ghosts have been caught; and unless Warner Bros. decides to do a movie showing Scooby and the others catching the actual ghosts the writers had planned, that's the theory I'm going with.  Overall, I still love this show and like I said, it's the best Scooby-Doo I've seen to date (I haven't seen Mystery Incorporated yet, but with some of the money I got for Christmas I ordered the complete first season as judging from the trailer on disc 2 of this set it looks to be the greatest Scooby-Doo cartoon of all).  I know not everyone likes it, but I will always enjoy it.",1419897600,,13363,4.387688544639217

Love Daphne's new look! Sporting a new hair cut and a purple jumper (classic 80's), she resembles April O'Neal in purple. Shaggy trades in his green shirt and bell bottom pants for a red shirt and blue jeans. And Fred and Velma are absent once again, after having a few guest spots on the previous ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"", before that having been absent for 5 years. They're replaced by new characters Vincent Van Ghoul (voiced by the late Vincent Van Price) and Flim-Flam. Scrappy also stars, but he's less active in this series. He also seems toned down, but that may just be compared to Flim-Flam, who I don't find as bad as some people (I tolerate Scrappy, too) he will definitely try your nerves and he adds absolutely nothing to the show. The two ghost who guarded the chest who chase the gang around will also get annoying. But I definitely enjoy this entry. Maybe because Daphne's my favorite character, and she's more active and useful in this series, and her new look rocks!",1409011200,3,1163,4.791044776119403

It's a short series, and Flim-Flam, the human boy, is admittedly almost annoying enough to offset Price's awesomeness, but most of what you love about Scooby is intact, although Fred, Velma, and Daphne are missing, and, rather than pulling the mask off the monster, the ghouls and ghosts the gang hunts down in this series are the real deal.

Don't get me wrong, it's a fun watch. If you're looking for great Scooby Doo though, look elsewhere. This is much more one to watch with lighthearted silliness. My roommate and I like to watch a few episodes at a time and laugh at the badness.
It is the complete series. I saw some other reviews saying it felt incomplete, but that is because the series was cancelled suddenly and never had a proper ending.

4112256,2,B003DU50U4,"From the start, let me say that I am a huge fan of Scooby Doo.  I loved the show growing up.  I now love watching it with my young son (and plan on watching it again with my next child).  In fact, my two year old and I just finished watching the two DVD sets released in recent years packaged as the ""first three seasons"" (although perhaps not strictly chronological).  I just wrote a glowing Amazon review of the first DVD set of the first two seasons.  We bought this series to watch after the first three seasons, partially because of the value - a lot of material for the expense.  However, I have a couple of problems with this series from the start.

First and most importantly, from a father's perspective, this series may be a bit much for young children.  The back of the DVD states that this series is about, ""[o]nce banned to an enchanted Chest of Demons for eternity, all 13 spirits are now loose to wreak havoc on the world. . .""  The first episode has two ghosts talking about needing to find someone (Scooby Doo) among the living to open the Chest of Demons.  This is probably fine for older kids, but I am not ready yet for my son to start talking about a Chest of Demons or thinking about spirits and death.

Second, this emphasis on demons, spirits, etc. seems to depart from the classic Scooby Doo model.  The gang has always used investigation, reason, and bravery to find the natural causes (bad guys) which often mask as supernatural phenomenon (ghosts, mythic creatures, etc.)  I am sure there are great parts to the series, including the Vincent Price work, but is this really an improvement on the gang fighting bad guys, while occasionally traveling, saving Wimbledon, and hanging out with the Harlem Globetrotters?",1339545600,,1741,4.559485530546624

4112259,4,B003DU50U4,"THE 13 GHOSTS OF SCOOBY-DOO is an unusually promising middle-period variant of the long-running Mystery-Comedy Cartoon series. The addition of a strong fantasy element is a breakout landmark.

Most of all, the continuing guest character of Mystic ""Vincent Van Ghoul"", voiced by Classic Horror Star Supreme, VINCENT PRICE, lends this particular show a distinction unmatched in the Universe of Doo.

13 GHOSTS is the first serialized version of SCOOBY-DOO which follows in sequence a continuing storyline established in the initial episodes.

An intriguing element is the focus on some of Scooby's earliest encounters with ""real"" supernatural spooks (as opposed to masked crooks). This foreshadows such superior DVD animated features as SCOOBY-DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND, SCOOBY-DOO AND THE WITCH'S GHOST and SCOOBY-DOO AND THE GOBLIN KING.

A disappointing aspect of 13 GHOSTS is that the serial abruptly stops just shy of the overall story's conclusion. Unfortunately, the show was prematurely canceled before the final episodes could be made.

The absence of regular characters Freddy and Velma, the misuse of made-over ing&eacute;nue Daphne as mere decor, along with the (subdued) presence of unpopular little Scrappy-Doo, are further counts against the show.

However, it's the grating dominance of the extraneous new character Film-Flam, a token ethnic street brat with a flippant, arrogant attitude, that most seriously mars the series.

Happily, the redeeming presence of the magnificent Price and a fresh touch of color and imagination save the show and restore the high quality of earlier (pre-Scrappy) series. For these reasons, THE 13 GHOSTS OF SCOOBY-DOO is recommended to all fans of the Scoob, as well as admirers of the sublime Vinnie.

[Vincent Price may be best known to young viewers for his memorably sinister spoken monologue in Michael Jackson's momentous ""THRILLER"". Reasonably mature Scooby fans desiring a deeper acquaintance with Vincent Price would enjoy the legendary Hollywood actor's rich, deliciously over-ripe performances in the following ""starter set"": THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS, LAURA, DRAGONWYCK, HOUSE OF WAX (1953),  THE FLY (1958), HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (1958), THE TINGLER, HOUSE OF USHER (1960), PIT AND THE PENDULUM (1961), TALES OF TERROR, THE RAVEN (1963), COMEDY OF TERRORS, THE HAUNTED PALACE, THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (1964), THE TOMB OF LIGIEA, WITCHFINDER GENERAL/CONQUERER WORM, THE ABOMINABLE DR.

4112262,3,B003DU50U4,"This is an interesting series of episodes where Scooby and Shaggy are tricked by 2 ghosts into opening a chest full of 13 dangerous ghosts. As a result they end up going around the world with Daphne, Scrappy Doo, and their new friend Flim Flam trying to retrap them in the chest.

Helping Scooby and the gang is their new warlock ally voiced by Vincent Price. Mr. Price really adds a nice touch.

It is an interesting series where they travel through different parts of the world on their quest to recapture the ghosts, and there is delightful comedy. (If sometimes a little campy.)

Sadly, the series is incomplete, and there are a few things that will make you say: ""Huh?"" For one thing, the ghosts all escaped when Scooby and Shaggy were tricked into opening the chest. But when they open the chest to retrap a ghost, there doesn't seem to be any danger of the already trapped ghosts escaping. Oh, the chest is opened in the Bermuda triangle to be sure and some ghosts escape. (But no one we have already seen.)

Also, while there seems to be a danger of one ghost gaining control of the chest from time to time, the 2 ghosts who tricked Shaggy and Scooby into opening the chest never express concern that the ghosts are gradually being recaptured.

And sadly, the story doesn't exactly conclude. Now one possibility is that the series was terminated before the story could finish. But it still leaves us with an incomplete story.

An interesting side note is that this was the last Scooby Doo series where Heather North provided the voice of Daphne. (Though she would briefly reprise her role some years later in the 2 films ""Scooby Doo and the Legend of the Vampire"" and ""The Monster of Mexico."")

It's a cute series. And it certainly didn't hurt that Vincent Price teamed up with Scooby Doo, Shaggy, Daphne, and their friend Flim Flam. But this series does suffer from the lack of a real conclusion.",1304553600,2,1905,4.5852941176470585

4112264,1,B003DU50U4,"The nadir of the Scooby-Doo franchise was this horrendous '80s series that takes bad writing and cheesy camp to new lows. Not even the addition of Vincent Price or the fact that Scooby and Shaggy are dealing with real ghosts helps elevate these pathetically written scripts, and the single worst character to ever appear on television, Flim Flam.

Whoever invented this character should be placed before a firing squad. Flim flam is the epitome of bad '80s sitcom kids, obnoxiously precocious, scene-stealing, and annoying every single time he speaks or appears onscreen. If you don't want your kids turning into serial killers, don't let them watch this series, because that's the effect this Mary Sue (Gary Stu) character has. You just want to slowly carve him up into little pieces so that you'll never have to see that stupid grin again (and I'm a pacifist).

Mercifully, due to poor ratings, the show was cancelled before they even captured the 13 demons. This had never happened to a Scooby-Doo series before or since. Even the much-maligned Scrappy was never this poorly received. (Scrappy appears in this series, and is honestly, the least issue).

As to the aforementioned demons, they were actually designed well; they're meant to look scary. The problem is that within the context of such utter stupidity, thanks to such bad writing, they're nothing but eye candy. I don't know how or why Vincent Prince consented to this, but he must have been desperate for cash.

People who know Hannah-Barbera cartoons from the earliest days know that humor is at the forefront of each of their series. However, HB's humor, while at times silly, is generally character and narrative based. In the setting of their world (where sapient animals exist, and are sometimes second class citizens), the stories have a kind of logic to them, and, as out-there as they can get, the characters and stories feature great writing and voice-acting, which actually lends them a modicum of believability for that milieu. This was certainly true of Scooby-Doo, but also of their other stars, Yogi-Bear, Snagglepuss, The Flinstones, Huckleberry Hound, Dynomutt, etc. True, during the '70s, some Scooby-Doo episodes lost that as they veered into overt camp (the crossover episodes with the Three Stooges and Tim Conway, for example), but the majority maintain the right balance of funny and interesting. 13 Ghosts abandons any attempt at those classic elements for a stab at the worst of '80s cartoons, and the result is tedious, unfunny, uninteresting, unscary, unintelligent, etc. It's utter crap. Where HB cartoons of the '50s-'70s could be enjoyed by all ages, and still are, this '80s incarnation is suitable for only the very young or the very stupid.

Based on the continuity of the series, specifically Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island and the later films and series, these events cannot have taken place anyway (which is self-evident as the stories lack any shred of logic), as Daphne has never encountered a real ghost/monster prior to the ones in Zombie Island. Since it's also established that Scooby Doo had become a TV star (see Scooby Doo Goes Hollywood), Scooby Doo and the 13 Ghosts should be seen as a failed in-universe cartoon starring Scooby, Shaggy and Daphne as themselves.

In closing, despite how bad this series is, and what a chore it is to get through, there's one episode that's worthy of note, and that's the one where Scooby quits ghost-hunting and goes home (incidentally, this series shows two completely different groups of parents for Scooby in two different homes, underscoring the fact that the producers/writers couldn't even keep their own continuity straight, never mind the fact that the earlier series established that Scooby was born in Shaggy's house). That episode shows a It's a Wonderful Life-type scenario as Scooby watches as his friends age and turn twisted without him. It was an almost daring script. Shame the rest of it is so abysmal (and considering that Scooby Doo is hardly high culture, that's a particularly low depth).

Only for the absolute completists and masochists.",1296864000,5,4104,5.062130177514793

4112266,5,B003DU50U4,"After Hannah-Barbera's huge success with previous Scooby-Doo shows, they decided that for the 7th series they would incorporate more supernatural themes in the show while still keeping that good ole' fashioned Scooby humor.  Did they manage to still pull of a really good series?  You bet they did!

Story - Scooby, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Daphne are on their way to Hawaii when they have to crash land their plane in a strange town.  In an attempt to leave the town, they end up exploring a mysterious old castle inhabited by 2 dim-witted ghosts and a chest that contains 13 dangerous spirits.  The ghosts are trapped in the chest forever unless a living creature opens the chest and lets them out.  Well, this is exactly what Shaggy and Scooby do, which sets them on a quest, with newly aquired friends Flim Flam and Vincent van Ghoul, to capture the 13 ghosts and trap them back into the chest.

Development - The producers were definitely trying to change a few things in the Scooby-Doo image with this series.  While still trying to get adult viewers with nostalgia and child viewers with silliness, a new current feeling was added to the series to draw teens to the show.  The gang had new 80s style clothes as opposed to their 70s outfits, and the monsters, instead of being masked men, were real ghosts instead.  Speaking of real ghosts, there is a bit of the occult in the series, but it is quite hard to take it seriously with all of the jokes in the series.  The 30 minute episodes, I feel, live up to the Scooby-Doo name, and I thoroughly enjoyed them.

Overall, this is a great series for the family, although you may want to stay away from it if you are anti-the occult.  But still, despite the changes, it's a really fun TV cartoon series perfect for a lighthearted TV night at home.",1294617600,,1795,4.554517133956386

4112274,3,B003DU50U4,"I was happy to get this as part of my collection. I found it interesting, yet incomplete.

Pros:
+Trying to capture the thirteen ghost of a Demon Chest was a very fascinating storyline.
+Scrappy didn't seem to try to steal the spotlight from his uncle. In fact, I didn't find him annoying at ALL.
+Scooby's parents.
+Vincent was an excellent addition to the season. I loved his episode narrations.
+Same classic humor from the original series. I did enjoy them dressing up for certain situations.
+Scooby snacks seemed to have a different effect on Scooby then usual.

Cons:
-I felt that the season was incomplete. They didn't capture all thirteen ghosts. It appeared to be only eleven of them. I felt as if the season should have ran fifteen or sixteen episodes.
-Flim Flam did gain my appeal with his sales pitches, however, trying to overpower the season really made me dislike him. He had too many plot contrivances.
-I hated the makeover of the Mystery Machine.
-Most of the episodes were weak with villians that weren't even a challenge to defeat. Funny because the gang spent most of their time running.
-They made Daphne virtually invisible. She didn't add much to the season at all.
-Weerd and Bogul were able to do some things, yet not be able to do other things. Didn't make any sense.
-I really missed Fred and Velma. They were really the smarter half of the gang.

Episodes:
1) I found Lotsa Luck Joy Juice being too convenient. Uck! I found it farfetched that Shaggy was their pilot. Discarding those two plotlines, I found this to be an intriguing episode that set the premise for the entire season. 4.5/5
2) Maldor in my opinion was the most challenging ghost that they had to capture. To me, it was an exciting episode which still had me anticipating what was next. Scooby being close to a Danish prince was cool. The scenes when they were trying to wake up Daphne was touching. Best episode of the season. 5/5
3) It was a cool twist that the shadow wasn't one of the ghosts that they had to capture. 4/5
4) By this point, being four times in a row, I got tired of Flim Flam catching the ghosts. Not only that, but the season was starting to focus too much on him. The trophy and song scene really was too much. 2.5/5
5) The villian was laughable in this somewhat fun episode. 3/5
6) Technically, from my understanding, the ghost that they captured was a combination of the ghosts that were already in their possesion. Flim Flam was beginning to be more and more of a show stealer. 3/5
7) One of my least favorite episodes so far. It's not explained how someone that Vincent knew from the past was one of the thirteen ghosts. 1/5
8) Yet another situation where they could not have won without Vincent's help. He was the leader of this task force. 2.5/5
9) Slime Time was a really good villian in a really weak episode. The thought of them replacing Scooby was insulting. How could the future that Vincent had shown Scooby exist if they were supposed to be killed by the guy in the armor? 1/5
10) Finally, another episode that I really liked, but why couldn't Daphne or Shaggy be the one holding the chest when Scooby threw the comic section into it? 4/5
11) It would have been more appropriate for Shaggy to be holding the chest in this episode instead of Scrappy and Flim Flam for the second time in a row. Ghost proof Handcuffs. Yeah, right! 2.5/5
12) Another episodefocused on Flim Flam. Ugh! However, I did enjoy this one. 4.5/5
13) Finally, Daphne was actually portrayed as one of the smarter characters, however, it was too little too late. Very weak episode for a season finale. It left me with a very unsatisfying feeling.  2.5/5

Overall ratings: 3/5

While visiting a temple in Honolulu, Scooby and Shaggy are tricked into opening the Chest of Demons, which houses 13 ghosts and ghouls. The ghosts however, can only be returned to the chest by those who originally released them. So, it's left up to Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, new friend Flim Flam and Vincent Van Ghoul(voiced by Vincent Price) to travel the world and recapture them all. Unlike the original Scooby cartoon shows, the ghosts and ghouls in this show aren't wearing masks because they're real. I found the show to be quite entertaining. Sure, it's old-school all the way but entertaining nonetheless.

If I had one gripe with the show, it would be(let's all say it together, lol)Scrappy. To save the life of me, I don't know why they ever created the character. Scrappy has to be one of most annoying cartoon characters I've ever had the displeasure of watching. What bothers me the most is how his character always seems to try and steal the show from Scoob.

4112281,5,B003DU50U4,"Interesting review title, isn't it? While watching the DVDs on this set, and finally rewatching the cartoons I remembered from my childhood, I realized that this show did some things that pretty much brings the Scooby-verse together.

For one, this series has real ghosts in every episode. No Fred and Daphne. It was the last series with Scrappy. Both Daphne and the Mystery Machine got a visual update.

Now, the series utilizes imagery from the old titles sequences of older Scooby-Doo series' to be representative of real ghosts and their powers. For instance, the ghost who looks like an evil version of He-Man's Orko has eyes like the outlined eyes near the end of the ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" titles. In one episode a ghost's powers creates an orange swirling portal like the the swirling orange tunnel in the opening sequence of ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"".

Flim-Flam many believe is an annoying addition to the gang, but actually he's a counterpoint to Scrappy that was much needed. He has the trap mentality of Fred but the showmanship flair of many of the old Shaggy & Scooby chase scene trick the monster antics.

Vincent Price as Vincent Van Ghoul lends a credibility to Scooby-Doo like nothing else. The addition of his character helps make the show having real ghosts seem more real, more believable, and his narrative poetry is not to be missed!

The reason why I say credibility is because the fake ghost era of Scooby-Doo was much like early huanted house film era horror in the USA with all monsters being hoaxes (such as ""The Cat And The Canary"" from 1927). By adding Vincent Price though it takes Scooby into the next phase, ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""13 Ghosts"", and such...and I mean the originals, NOT the remakes!

It's a great series and a must-have for any Scooby collector. Also, this series does have other attributes which were later added into ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" from our seeing Scooby's parents for the first time, to the classic stop the story for a comedic news segment, and for the first time the characters break the 4th wall and acknowledge that they are in fact in a cartoon!

I think it was the best-written show on television, of any genre, animated or live action, at the time it was aired.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled by the sheer amount of care given to the classic characters in Mystery Incorporated, which is why this series may seem so awful in comparison.  I was driven to seek this out by a throwaway bit in Mystery Incorporated where they briefly discuss Scrappy Doo and the fate of Flim Flam.

Scrappy Doo and Flim Flam.  Two totally unnecessary and outright obnoxious new characters.  They are bad enough and drag down the entire show.  But what's worse is that Fred and Velma are completely absent from this show.  (Fred was away at trapping camp, but still.)  Some clueless studio exec clearly thought that neither Fred nor Velma were relevant to the youth of the 80s, and that an obnoxious puppy and a child con artist/stereotype were much more relevant to those kids.  I hope that exec is night managing a Taco Bell right now, because, man, that's a terrible decision.

Mix in slapdash and outright shoddy writing with the toxic brew of bad characters and the absence of old favorites, and you get this mess.  Case in point: in episode 1, we arrive in the Himalayas, at the base of which is a vintage 1800s Central European village run by a burgermeister.  ???  Really?  How much effort would it have taken to call the mountains the Alps?  I don't think it's being picky to expect the writers to get basic things right, when it costs them nothing.

And the lack of the chase songs.  Wow.  There are moments when I started singing ""Hey Girl You Got Me Runnin'"" because it was the appropriate place, but they cheaped out on any kind of classic or even updated Scooby Doo chase music.

Scooby Doo completists will insist on watching this.  I did.  Now I'm trying to black it out as quickly as possible.  For everyone else, avoid!",1526947200,,1986,4.592592592592593

The characters are poorly done, the animation is poorly done, the plot is poorly done.  This is just bad.  The Mystery Inc. gang is sans Fred and Velma, and a Vincent Price character has been added.  Run away from this one.",1522022400,,354,4.303030303030303
