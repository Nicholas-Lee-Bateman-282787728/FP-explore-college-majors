8300413,5,B001F12IZ8,"Full of incredible situations, terrible danger, tremendous explosions, World's Most amazing videos does the impossible; it lives up to it's title. I bought this for my girlfriend, and we have watched this lone DVD multiple times. It truly has to be seen to be appreciated. The most incredible situations to ever be caught on tape, are narrated expertly creating a tense and thrilling experience.

I'm serious, this is one of my favorite things of all time. There are a lot of things on Amazon that people give 5 stars for, and I have bought many of them. However, this little DVD is the only thing (to this point) that I have thought worth reviewing. I desperately want to get my hands on the rest of the series. If anyone knows of a way, please let me know.",1348444800,3,758,4.532846715328467
