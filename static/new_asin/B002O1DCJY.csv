8375826,3,B002O1DCJY,"Usually when the interviewees are listed as a couple, they're man and wife.  However, here ""Missy & Alex"" are mother and son.  This episode is unique in that it covers Paul, a male senior citizen, and Alex, a little boy.
Every time I think ""Surely hoarders is going to hit a rut,"" the show always shows something unique and novel.  Here, the senior citizen cries out, ""Well, why doesn't the county came in and just shoot me?""!!  You usually don't hear interviewees making that threat.  Both the older man and the little boy cry, negating ideas that only members of the fairer sex would do that.
The child referred to plush toys as his ""fluffies.""  I mean, I guess it's age-appropriate, but I hope he learns the correct term one day.  They show the little boy in a clean room with another boy.  The work implies that the little boy now has friends, but the 2nd child is really his brother.  We never learn if the little boy developed social skills to be able to enteract with non-relatives.
The older man was furious that his scrap metal wasn't going to garner a huge price.  But I was thinking, ""Well, it's better than nothing.""  Many of these televised hoarders disturb me, but I actually encourage all viewers to consider selling/recycling unused resources like metal.
If this season leaves you non-plussed, know that season 3 is a great improvement.  The series gets better with time, truthfully.",1309219200,2,1399,4.688524590163935
