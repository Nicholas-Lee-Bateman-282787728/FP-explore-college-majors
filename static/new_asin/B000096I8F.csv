It would have been nice to see more opinions of those on the right...the film did seem to have a bit of a biased edge to it, like it was pushing an agenda.  Good awareness piece though.",1148860800,7,428,4.158536585365853
1879775,3,B000096I8F,"I have not yet seen this, but I am ordering it. So, why am I reviewing? Well, actually, I'm not.

I was reading some of the reviews and one of them listed some points. One of those points was unfactual, and as a Floridian, I feel I need to set it straight. Here is what the reviewer wrote: ""2. There is a case that African American voters were turned away - however, where is the same case for the many Haitan American voters who were also turned away in droves, who are known to be sympathetic towards Republican causes.""

Like I said, I live in Florida, South Florida to be exact. I know alot of Hatians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and on... I feel this commentator is incorrect because:

1) Haitians ARE Black and could be considered, on apearance and zip code, as being African American!

2) It's the Cubans of Miami who are ""sympathetic to the Republican cause""; not the Haitians. Haitians and Puerto Ricans, generally, vote Democrat. The Cubans used to vote Democrat until JFK, whom they never forgave for the Bay of Pigs.

Does anyone remember the famous qoute from Deepthroat, ""follow the money""? Follow along with what has become of all the individuals that were part of what happened in 2000. Namely, Catherine Harris. Also, you find ""conspiracy"" (a word which does NOT imply you put on your tin-foil hat!) in the 2004 elections. Find-out who owns the voting machines (two brothers) and then take a look at their religio-political agenda. One of which, is the return of slavery. And, we come full circle.

It is the stuff that usually is found in fiction novels but it happened right here in the USA; the country that proportedly sets the standard for Liberty and Democracy in the world. Unfortunately, our election process has been corrupted and this film shows how it happened. It is a shame that some people I have talked to admit that although it is most possible and probable that the fix was in, we are still better off with the person who won the presidency, so, no harm, no foul; nevermind there was wrongdoing and illegal practices. If we don't demand a paper trail in the next election I think it will cause so much disinfrancisement that the percentage of voters showing up at the polls will fall even more. After the last two elections I have no faith and believe we need to call in election observers from foreign countries.

I question whether democracy is alive anymore and if it is too late in our life times to correct this.

Well, you probably do, and well, if you're looking at this DVD in the first place, and you probably remember feeling angst one way or another about those days post-2000 election night.  Well, Greenwald doesn't attempt to spurn those feelings; instead, he shows why decisively on both sides of the aisle (but with an admittedly more anti-Republican focus), the 2000 election was a farcical debacle.

This was one of many DVD's to come out after that election, but Greenwald's films have the appreciativeness of speed, accuracy, and quality, which many frankly lack.  Critical sources consisting of authors, Florida community leaders, and many other people add their two cents to this film and give even more depth and credibility.  Even Danny Glover takes the role of 'conductor' if you will, through at least a bit of the film.

Overall though, the film cut to the quick as it needed, and should remind us not what's wrong with our voting system, although it does that plent.  But what we can do to make it better, and why the fight for voting rights is an ever eventful fight.",1115942400,9,1113,4.795811518324608

1879782,5,B000096I8F,"Anyone who believes that George Bush was actually elected to the White House, or, for that matter, that we actually live in a democracy had better get a look at this film.

In a concise, engaging fashion, this investigative report brings us back to the controversial election of 2000, and the seemingly endless Florida recount.  The shocking news here is not that Gore would have won if ALL the votes were counted, but that tens of thousands of voters - predominently African-American, overwhelmingly Democrat - were ""disqualified"" from voting in the first place, by means of a ""felon purge list"" which smacks of foul play by the partisan Secretary of State, Katherine Harris.

For me, the most chilling part of the film comes at the very end, in a short expose of touch screen electronic voting machines.  They have been a source of some controversy in my home state, as they leave no paper trail which can ever be verified.

In the aftermath of the most recent elections, which John Kerry seemed to be winning until suddenly the votes are in and he loses, maybe it's time for a sequel, ""Unprecedented II: The Mandate.""",1100995200,8,1120,4.752577319587629
1879783,2,B000096I8F,"In some ways this is a documentary everyone can love, whether you live in a Blue state or a Red state. For Lefties, this movie provides moral support for believing that Gore won Florida and the Presidency in 2000. For conservatives, it's a fun (but irrelevant) trip down memory lane, given that the two main villains both won reelection (Jeb Bush won Florida in 2002 by 13 percentage points and George Bush won Florida in 2004 by 5 points).

But in another sense, no one can love this documentary for the simple reason that it fails to be even remotely objective: no one in the Bush camp was interviewed, only one Florida county official was interviewed (for about 10 seconds), and no other Republican lawyer, political official or commentator was allowed to comment. This movie raised some interesting points, too bad we only hear one side.

But maybe it depends on how we're supposed to view it. Is it journalism or activism? If it were judged as an attempt at objective journalism, I doubt even Dan Rather would take it seriously. If it's supposed to be a partisan piece with a political agenda, then it only preaches to the choir - and preach it does! - but minus the charm found in Michael Moore films.

1879794,4,B000096I8F,"As we are mere hours away from the opening of the polls, it is appropriate to take a good, hard look at this concise, fast-paced documentary, which serves as a history lesson on our nation's most controversial election in 2000. No film will motivate you more to vote today, and one would hope that subsequent election reforms would ensure history would not repeat itself. Michael Moore covered this ground on a cursory albeit dramatically effective manner in the memorable beginning of his documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". Filmmakers Richard Ray Prez and Joan Sekler, however, delve much deeper into the morass that changed the course of our leadership.

This film is a powerful indictment of the current electoral process, as the disturbing picture that emerges is fraught with suspicious irregularities, electoral injustices, and sinister voter purges in a state governed by Jeb Bush, the winning candidate's brother. We learn Jeb Bush's motivation for misrepresenting the election results corresponds with his extreme unpopularity with blacks in his state. The Republican strategy was intended to suppress the democratic vote since 93% of African Americans are registered Democrats. The documentary also goes into voters improperly removed from the rolls, with a particular emphasis on the ""Felon Purge List"". In one of the more shocking moments, the film reveals that more than 175,000 ballots were uncounted by Florida's voting machines. No complete hand recount was ever conducted. From there, we get into the half-hearted attempts to recount votes in certain counties, which raised all sorts of still open-ended issues. Much of the film follows this process and ends with a look at reforms and concerns for the future, with an emphasis on controversies connected to touchscreen voting. The filmmakers disclose that only a year later, when a consortium of U.S. media organizations published results of an exhaustive examination of these unread ballots, that the conclusion was reached that Al Gore received more votes and would have been our 43rd President. Granted, Prez and Sekler have a tendency toward overstatement at times and some of the evidence presented is apocryphal, but the issues raised make this one of the most important films to watch in this or any election year. In fact, considering how close the 2004 race is at this moment, I would consider this essential viewing.",1099267200,4,2391,5.275590551181103
1879795,5,B000096I8F,"""Unprecedented:  The 2000 Presidential Election"" tells the story behind the shameful clutching of victory from the jaws of defeat by the Bush team over Al Gore through a manipulation of the political process in Florida.  The result was democracy denied and the accession to the presidency of a candidate who lost the popular vote and, but for the application of tactics befitting a totalitarian state, eked out ""victory"" by adding the scandal-tarnished electoral votes of Florida.

This film, produced by Robert Greenwald, with comments by Danny Glover and narration by Peter Coyote, has won a host of documentary awards.  It tells the story of the calamitous post-election period in a simple and straightforward way in revealing the manipulation of the democratic process through highjacking the voting process before and after the election.

Greg Palast, author of the bestselling work ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"" and the current DVD adapted from it, is a featured source in this hard-hitting documentary.  He relates how, after being spurned in his efforts to track down the story of how Jeb Bush, the Republican presidential candidate's brother, as Florida governor, with the assistance of Secretary of State Katherine Harris, was responsible for scrubbing 95,000 voters from the voting roles.  Almost all of the deprived were African Americans, whose voting rights were denied the pretense of preventing felons from voting under Florida law.

It was necessary for Palast to obtain cooperation and support from across the Atlantic through the British Broadcasting Corporation to tackle this story after being spurned by the U.S. corporate media.  When he visited Florida's capital city of Tallahassee Palast blew the story wide open.  Palast had learned that a company called Data Base Technologies had been hired to run a check of names of Florida prospective voters to determine if they had previous felony convictions.

While DBT provided a long list of names extending across America, company functionaries cautioned Jeb Bush and his subordinates to check more thoroughly since the original list was considered to be preliminary.  This raw list needed refinement by checking out names on the list individually.

Palast visited Clay Roberts, Katherine Harris's second in command and Florida's elections commissioner.  In a brief but highly revealing interview, an agitated Roberts, the moment that the BBC reporter mentioned Data Base Technologies and the list it prepared for the state of Florida, jumped up from his chair.  In a trembling, angry tone he terminated the interview.  When Palast rose and attempted to show the DBT list, which was only supposed to serve as a beginning point prior to additional checking, Roberts darted into his office.

A still highly agitated Roberts called out to Palast.  As he declared that the reporter must leave immediately a Florida State Trooper summoned by the rattled Roberts to escort Palast from the building flashed Palast a sympathetic smile and declared, ""There's never a dull moment around here.""

While citing the mainstream media for its failure to reveal what was really happening in the critical post-election period, the film discloses that the first network to declare George Bush the winner of the election was his first cousin John Ellis, who ran the election desk at Fox News.

Another important event covered in ""Unprecedented"" is the riot at Miami's Federal Building, when Republican thugs disrupted the recounting of Dade County presidential ballots.  Certain key figures are identified, office staffers of Republican congressmen who visited Florida to disrupt the recount process.

The U.S. Supreme Court majority's action in halting the Florida recount, thereby conferring victory on Bush, is also examined.  The conflicts of interest of Chief Justice Antonin Scalia and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas are disclosed, as well as how they were disregarded for the sake of political expedience.",1097798400,14,3972,5.360708534621578

These are factual events that this DVD never mentions, nor most liberals bother to research.  In this liberal day and age, where reason is thrown aside for irrational hatred, a moderate like me looks strangely conservative.  This movie, like Farenheit 9/11, or any Michael Moore or Greenwald movie, is just another propaganda stunt to rewrite history and try to influence the 2004 election.

(See Bob Herbert's 8/16/04 ""Suppress the Vote"" in New York Times... potential FLA voters are being harrassed already).  Still, as the DVD states, Gore asked for a recount in only four counties, not the whole state.  This move gave the GOP a huge selling point:  Gore only wanted Democratic counties recounted; he didn't care about ""every vote being counted.""  Also, the GOP had tough folksy Jim Baker stating their case.  And Gore had... uhhh... Warren Christopher, slight in his eastern pinstripes, and barely audible in too long arguments.  So, if Florida is a case in point of how Gore does politics, he was quite lame.  (That's not even counting Gore retracting his concession).  Were and are the GOP Win At All Costs Machiavellians?

If you add up the number of votes stolen in all the different ways reported in the documentary, and compare it with the best estimates of the number of votes Nader got by people who would definitely have voted even if he weren't running, and who would have voted for Gore rather than placed a protest vote with another third party candidate, you see that the stolen votes far outweigh those lost by Gore due to Nader.  Furthermore, it really looks as though Jeb Bush's people would have created as much confusion and disenfranchisement as they thought they needed to win.

1879822,5,B000096I8F,"This documentary did an exceptional job of investigating the Florida vote controversy.
To address other negative reviewers arguments:
The documentary didn't try to link the felon list to black disenfranchisement alone. They offered the statistic that the majority of ex-felons vote for Democrats while also noting that 90% of all blacks vote for Democrats. Additionally, 50% of ex-felons in Florida are black. Add it all up, and Katharine Harris's masterful list of names would inevitably affect many more Democratic voters than Republican ones. It's as simple as that. She knew what she was doing. Purging of voter rolls is not new, but a statewide 15% error rate is absurb and wrong.
 It WAS a concerted effort to block Democratic voters.
One fact that wasn't mentioned in the documentary was that the election commissioner in one county had her name removed from the rolls because she was supposedly a felon!
Harris was the CO-CHAIR of BUSH'S CAMPAIGN and she got to use her ""discretion"" to decide which votes to count!  That fact alone is so absolutely outrageous (but true, regardless of your bias).
There is no doubt that this isn't the first time an election was stolen, even at the presidential level. But it's still disconcerting to know that the man who lost the popular vote and, by voters' intent, lost the electoral college is president today.
Even if you forget all the disenfranchisement controversy and just consider the thousands of votes Pat Buchanan got in the heavily Jewish/Democratic area with the infamous butterfly ballot, Gore would have won. Many voters mistakenly voted for Buchanan -- evident in personal testimonies and apparent in the extremely high number of votes Buchanan got in these Jewish communities. Buchanan is known for essentially saying the Holocaust didn't happen or something anti-Semitic like that (regardless of the details, even Buchanan himself stated after the election that those votes clearly weren't meant for him).
Sure, you can say some things are ""biased"" in this, but Republicans are so guilty of trying to sway the public view with bias (like claiming that Democrats wanted to block the military overseas ballots, which is just not true -- they wanted to make sure that illegal overseas absentee ballots were not counted). Democrats could make the claim that Republicans wanted to block the black and Jewish vote, which they basically did, but not exactly so. It's more true than saying Democrats didn't want the military to vote, which is what James Baker stated in a press conference on Bush's behalf.  Just a blatant lie.
Lately Republicans try to equate ""liberal bias"" with something being false, when in fact it's their own bias that leads them to believe the truth is biased against them! I used to vote for Republicans more often than not, but now I have trouble seeing beyond the party affiliation. I admit I am a Jim Jeffords independent, but I admire moderate/independent-thinking Republicans such as John McCain, George Voinovich, and Arlen Specter, to name a few.
Overall, the documentary is not necessarily exciting, but at times the evidence presented is infuriating and shocking, though all completely true. Definitely a must-see for anyone living and voting in America.",1067817600,197,3242,5.113207547169812

1879825,1,B000096I8F,"I just saw the video, and I didn't like it.  If the makers of this documentary wanted to be taken seriously, they should have had commentaries from both sides and analysis from independent observers.  As it is, most commentators were from the Democratic party, NAACP, and people that wrote books with titles like ""The Plot to Steal the Presidency"" and ""Betrayal of America; How the Supreme Court Undermined the Constitution and Chose our President"".  The video didn't even try to make it look like they were being unbiased...
And the points were biased or incomplete.  For example, one of the first points they make is that Jeb Bush used an old ""ex-con"" law to prevent black voters.  Specifically, the video alleged black disenfranchisement saying that black voter rights were reneged when DBT linked names with ex-convicts.  Well, I think that the DBT/Florida handling of this was terrible, and I'm not surprised.  I've never known a government agency to do something well, and do it cheap.  It's astounding that such idiotic and loose guidelines could have been used.  However, I don't see the link between this and a systematic black disenfranchisement.  The video says that since a majority of the ex-cons were black, the disenfranchisement targeted blacks.  If there was some right-wing conspiracy to deny black voters, the ""evil republicans"" would have MADE SURE that the ex-con list matched EXACTLY the voter who was denied the vote.  Afterall, 50% of the ex-cons on that list were BLACK.  Otherwise, a black ex-con's disenfranchisement could have been applied to a white person.  In fact, the two examples that the video outlines, clearly prove this.  Ex-con John Fitzgerald Jackson was matched to citizen Johnny Jackson.  But, John F. Jackson's race is listed as BLACK and Johnny Jackson's race is listed as UNKNOWN.  So, rather than taking away a black person's voting rights, DBT took away the voting rights of a person of unknown race.  If the republicans are trying to target the blacks, using loose guidelines would ensure that this happens frequently.  The other example was Thomas Cooper.  Supposedly, blacks were randomly targeted, even if they were not convicts, such as Thomas Cooper who is supposed to have committed a crime in 2007 (future?), and their right to vote was stolen.  However, first, this was obviously a typo in the date, not some evil agenda.  Second, Thomas Cooper's race is listed as WHITE.  So, again, the process was dumb, but there was no concerted effort to eliminate black voters.  If anything, the opposite happened, where black ex-cons were able to vote and white citizens were turned away at the voting booths.
Yes, the DBT ex-con list was terribly flawed, but the video does a stupid job of trying to link this to black disenfranchisement.  It was just a flawed system, and DBT was to blame, not some ""right-wing conpsiracy"".  And, this is proved at the end, when the video states that as part of a lawsuit settlement agreement, DBT would help identify disenfranchised voters.  NOT the state of Florida, Jeb Bush, and Kathleen Harris, even though they were also sued...",1063238400,17,3115,4.986434108527132

If ANY absentee vote isn't sent on time, then it doesn't count. Period. I don't care if it's from the Almighty himself, or from a soldier. How about some of that personal responsibility that Republicans are always screaming about? As a former airman, I voted in elections in my home state while I lived far, far away. I knew what I needed to do, and the military helped with that process. Still, it is up to YOU to make the arrangements to get the ballot and send it back in a timely fashion, so that it will arrive ON TIME. And you don't bellyache if it doesn't work that way because YOU were too lazy to do it.

Let's move on to the 2000 election.

The Felon Purge List

First of Greg Palast lied (no shock there) about this. Kathleen Harris was following state law, a law that has been on the books longer than she was alive, and was doing what was mandated by law. She had a list that was given to her by a independent company, this list was then handed out to all of the election commissioners across the state and THEY went through the list and purged off duplicate names, people who were not allowed to legally vote, people who had moved etc. The biggest complaints of wrongly purged names came from three counties, ALL of which had their lists purged by Democratic election commissioners, two of those being black. Remember that the master list that the film talks about was supposed to be a wide net and it was the election commissioners that needed to match and verify each name on it. Ion Sancho A Democrat and the supervisor of Elections for Leon County in Florida and later lead the voter recounts in Dade County has gone into great detail about this very issue. He said it was his job, as it was other supervisors and election commissioners to double check the list, remove names that shouldn't be there and then turn the list back into Harris. But you would never know this because this film leaves out the pertinent facts in building their false narrative.

The claim that the law to protect the validity of the voting process is somehow racially motivated is laughable, since all states have this type of law on the books. The claim that the ""felon purge list"" had a high percentage of blacks on it completely ignores that the percentage it had on it matched the percentage of blacks who were felons, therefore it showed no bias.

The film then also lied that Florida Felon Clemency laws are unconstitutional, they are not and never have been. Felons who move to Florida from another state HAVE to fill out a clemency application in order to vote in Florida. If they do not they have NO right to vote. The 2,883 felons that were purged were done so BY law no matter what this film says. BTW other states also have these types of laws too and they have never been ruled unconstitutional.

But let's pretend for a second that their narrative they are trying to sell is correct. That thousands of voters were illegally purged and couldn't vote, that should be rather easy to prove right????? Well, the Democratic Party spent millions of dollars using thousands of paid operatives that canvassed the majority of Florida looking for these looking for these disenfranchised voters. They went door to door, they advertised on the radio and TV for them, they sent out mailers, etc etc and guess what they found? (drum roll please) They found less than fifteen people that they could verify that tried to vote but were turned away and btw 6 of them (about half) were registered Republicans. The fact is there was NO widespread voting irregularities as this film claims.

The OFFICAL recount

The film claims that many counties didn't do a recount but sworn affidavits by multiple witnesses from both political parties in each county says otherwise. The fact is the numbers changed after the mandatory recount but not enough to have Gore win so in the minds of the extreme left obviously there was problem in the recounts because they KNOW their guy won. The funny thing is votes for Gore grew in counties where no republican official oversaw the recount as mandated by law so we must wonder if there was some type of tampering there, especially when the official media recount after the election came much closer to the original tally than the recount.

So now we have had two vote counts and both times Bush won the vote but the Gore camp was undeterred, they wanted to win at all cost but they were in a pickle. Florida law allowed a full statewide hand recount but every county would be counted AND the overseas ballots which had NOT been counted yet would also be included in the recount. The Gore camp knew that even if they got all of the over and under votes attributed to them (which was not going to happen) that would not counterbalance the overseas vote that generally favor Republicans by a 7:3 margin. So the democrats took it into their own hands and started illegal recounts in only 4 select counties. Why only 4 counties you ask - because these 4 counties had the highest percentage of democratic voters in Florida. Gore didn't want every vote counted, he only wanted to make sure that the Democratic Votes got counted.

The documentary falsely claimed that the Republicans were against hand-recounts, this is false. George Bush actually signed a very liberal law in Texas about hand recounts. What they wanted was to have the Florida LAW followed and have EVERY county recount not just those that favored Al Gore. The Democrats didn't care and knew the media was on their side so they did their highly questionable recounts which where rightly rejected in favor of the non-partisan counting that took place earlier. The Democrats went to the highly partisan Florida State Supreme courts who ruled that Harrison had to wait to certify the results which went against 100 years of election laws.

Next we hear about the overseas ballots that were counted (remember there was still a bunch that were sitting sealed and never got counted). The Democrats wanted to enforce State law on these ballots ignoring federal laws about overseas ballots. Ballots that are mailed by active duty servicemen many times don't get a APO postmark till 2 weeks AFTER they mailed them. We have always allowed this so as to not disenfranchise our military but in this case the Democrats wanted to have all of these votes overturned, luckily federal law prevailed and the ones in the system got counted. What didn't get counted was the ones that arrived after Nov 21st.

The republicans appealed the FSSC ruling that changed the election laws AFTER the fact, the video forgot to mention that the United States Supreme Court ruled in a 9-0 vote that the FSSC overstepped it's bounds and could not change laws after the fact. The decision was remanded to the FSSC with a very strong warning to cease partisan tinkering.

The ensuing riots in Miami when the Democrats took the ballots hostage and locked them and only Democratic operatives in the room was spun beyond belief. The Republicans were banging on the doors to let them in but the democrats refused and a loud mini-riot ensued. What the documentary forgot to tell you was that locking out the republicans was illegal, no one knows what sort of tampering to the ballots could have happened but if the Democrats wanted a fair and open recount why did they feel the need to lock out the republicans and the press and conduct their recounts in private?

Finally the deadline as prescribed by law came and Kathleen Harris certified the vote that George Bush won.

This should have been the end but the win-at-any-cost Democrats didn't want to give up so easy so they went back to their friendly FSSC. The highly partisan FSSC was in a bind, they had just been taken to the woodshed by all 9 justices of the USSC for meddling in the election and trying to ensure a Gore victory. But in a brazen snub to the highest court in the land 4 of the 7 FSSC ordered that a new hand recount be done of ALL counties but the recount would exclude the overseas ballots that were sealed.

The USSC stepped in again, this time ordering a emergency stay of the FSSC order. But once again the documentary LIED about the actual vote of the USSC claiming it was 5-4 when in reality it was 7-2 but don't believe me, read the actual Court verdict.

""Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy. See post, at 6 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2, 15 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The only disagreement is as to the remedy.""

The FSSC illegally ordered a recount AFTER the deadline for requesting one.
The FSSC illegally ordered a recount AFTER the vote had been certified
The FSSC illegally ordered a recount using NEW and highly ambiguous standards as to how a vote would be counted.
The FSSC illegally ignored 75 years of Florida Voting laws in their decisions.
The FSSC illegally changed election laws AFTER the votes.
The FSSC illegally stopped the counting of certain ballots for no reason.

The USSC had no option but to step in and stop the madness that the FSSC was attempting to do. Remember even the dissenting judges did NOT disagree that the FSSC was wrong they all recognized that they only dissented in remedy.

Finally the film lies about the media consortium finding but once again don't beleive me read the media's report on their finding

""Media Recount: Bush Won the 2000 Election
In the first full study of Florida's ballots since the election ended, The Miami Herald and USA Today reported George W. Bush would have widened his 537-vote victory to a 1,665-vote margin""
PBS

"" Florida Recounts Would Have Favored Bush

USA Today

The bottom line is

George Bush won the first count
George Bush won the second count
George Bush won the media recount

I find it incredibly frightening that the usual suspects are calling this film ""propaganda"" (since when is the truth propaganda?) and accusing those of us who are wise to what really happened of ""whining.""  How nice to know that some Americans take the democratic process, and the integrity and responsibility that go along with it, so lightly.  The film is far from some hysterical radical leftist propaganda piece; all of the people interviewed are calm, sane, and rational, and back up what they're saying with irrefutable proof.  I guess my idea of a radical leftist differs greatly from that of a neo-con.  It even points out shortcomings of Gore's side, such as saying that it wasn't right to have only demanded a recount of just 4 counties, but should have had a recount of the entire state, as per constitutional law.  The recount wasn't about being bitter ""losers"" or wanting one candidate to win; it was about making sure that every vote counted and that the democratic process wasn't trodden upon.  I was a junior in college during this time, and remember it as a very frustrating depressing time, unable to believe that something like this could happen in a democracy, that the U.S. Supreme Court would put a stop to the recount ordered by Florida's Supreme Court.  Even more frustrating is how a lot of people, whatever side they were on, just don't care.  Apathy is extremely dangerous in a democracy.

The subjects covered in the documentary include the outdated voting machines, untrustworthy new computerised voting machines, the various types of paper ballots that led to initial improper vote tallies, how thousands of names were stricken from the voting rolls, how a lot of the names on the lists of ex-felons being denied their constitutional right to vote after having served their time weren't even felons and had never even been arrested, how the civil rights of African-Americans were violated in scary shades of what happened before the Civil Rights Movement, how some of the pro-Bush protestors weren't Floridians but actually staff assistants to various Republican Senators and Congresspeople (one from as far away as Alaska), how these voting irregularities began even before 2000, and how Katherine Harris (the lovely woman who believes that electing non-Christians is tantamount to ""legislating sin""), uncaring there was a serious conflict of interest due to having been on Bush's campaign, used her clout to order the recount stopped.  These sorts of things aren't supposed to happen in a democracy, but sadly they did.

Though this is a great documentary and a good introduction to this awful time in recent American history, I wish it had been a bit longer.  There were some subjects that I felt weren't covered in enough depth, or important subjects that weren't really covered at all.  I would have liked, for example, to have seen more on the disenfranchisment of the African-American community and all of the Jewish votes that were mistakenly attributed to Buchanan.

7989794,4,B000096I8F,"The DVD's principal point is that our current voting system has disturbing barriers and a shocking lack of safeguards.  I'm not sure how exposing this danger can be considered unpatriotic or worthless by other reviewers?

As a result of the problems and situations shown in the DVD, citizens were  deprived of voting rights and could not have confidence their vote counted; and there is no evidence this situation is completely corrected.

 It also demonstrated that critical election officials with blatant conflicts of interest in the election process can also hold offices that directly influence the outcome of those elections on a massive scale.

This is like having a horse race where the judge owns a horse in the race and the judge is the only one who can watch the race happen.

Would you feel confident betting in a situation like this?

It's hard to believe this type of situation can exist in a country that claims it is the champion of democracy, but that's what the DVD is about and why I recommend it.  Maybe you saw this information years ago in the news; however, this DVD is an important, timely reminder and really focuses your attention on important issues of democracy and voting.

This seems like a pretty serious issue, and most of the negative reviews seem like attempts to keep people from watching and becoming concerned.  After watching this, anyone should be extremely concerned if not outright alarmed!  I know I was, and I am generally skeptical by nature.  The evidence is overwhelming and damning.

For those concerned that this is one sided, the DVD is surprisingly critical of Al Gore and the Democratic Party; and goes so far as to blame them as a significant part of the problem rather than victims.  The documentary is certainly not ""pro-Democratic Party"", but is convincing that Republicans schemes and actions were anti-democracy.

The DVD also used freeze frames to identify names, occupation, and home state of Republican stooges flown in to pose as protesting Florida citizens.  It's pretty amazing that the entire forefront of the protesting crowd was identified person by person with people from as far away as Alaska!

This has an eerie resemblance to the film ""Meet John Doe"" where planted anarchists upset Gary Cooper's political rally when he tries to be an honest politician, and that's the last thing people in control wanted in the movie.  The similarity is one of the creepiest things I've seen in years.
