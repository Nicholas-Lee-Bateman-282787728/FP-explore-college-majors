3967886,3,B002QW7J6S,"While this was very interesting, it didn't go far enough to satisfy my curiosity.  I also wanted to know how and what it was made of.  The creating of the ""action"" of the horse was very interesting.",1355788800,,198,4.324324324324325

3967888,5,B002QW7J6S,"The DVD, Making War Horse, is just great! This DVD shows what was necessary in making and working with the life size horse puppets appearing in the play. Those involved with the puppets learned---from Monty Roberts, of 'The Man Who Listens To Horses' fame---everything they needed to know about equine behavior. Then they went into action. As a result, the puppets act more like horses than horses do! One of those who works with the puppets said that they have the puppets move around---and even act up---more than actual horses generally would, so that the full idea of horses can come across to the audience. The action definitely adds interest to the play itself, of which a few short scenes are shown.
Anyone who has seen or heard of the play, would surely love watching this DVD.",1335225600,14,785,4.737226277372263

8377974,5,B002QW7J6S,"""Making War Horse"" is a fascinating documentary about the creative process that the members of the National Theatre Studio utilized to bring Michael Morpurgo's children's novel ""War Horse"" to the stage.  The director's vision early on was to build life size puppets to play the two main horses, Joey and Topthorn, and he brought in artists and designers from Handspring Puppet Company to collaborate. The final result is a powerful play about a horse sold to the British Army to serve as a cavalry mount in World War I. Watching the evolution of the puppet horse, eventually operated by three puppeteers---two inside and one outside---is enthralling and heart-stopping. They make the horse seem so real.  5 stars for this amazing inside look at the creation of a powerful theatrical event!  1 star, though, to Amazon. When I bought this documentary as a $9.99 download, Amazon did not include 8 extra features (over an hour of additional material) that I was expecting and hoping to view along with the documentary.",1399852800,,1015,4.994082840236686
8377975,5,B002QW7J6S,"Just try to pry yourself away from this documentary! No way can you look away! You are watching and amazed at the realism and ask, how can this be done, and Wow! What Talent! Check this video out and be amazed!",1387238400,,210,4.146341463414634
8377976,5,B002QW7J6S,"We went to see it on stage and wondered how everything was done.  ""Making War Horse"" helped us understand how much went into the puppetry, the acting, and the ability to make us see the horses as true horses instead of puppets.  You do need to see this before or after seeing the stage production so you can truly appreciate the work and efforts that went into it.",1386028800,2,364,4.338235294117647
8377977,3,B002QW7J6S,"Not what I expected. It is the making of an on-stage play. While interesting, I was expecting the 'making' of the film War Horse. I had no clue there had been a stage play produced.",1382400000,,181,4.2
8377978,5,B002QW7J6S,"Amazing"" story about the story."" I would never have thought this book could be brought to life through  puppets.  The behind the scenes story is fascinating.  The puppeteers are so enmeshed with the puppets that you accept the humans as part of the animal being portrayed.  I saw the motion picture.  It did not begin to match the emotional impact of this stage play, and all I have seen of the play so far is bits and pieces within this video.  I feel blessed that I will be seeing  the puppets live, on stage, in a few weeks.",1376524800,2,527,4.316326530612245
8377979,4,B002QW7J6S,"Concentrates primarily on the puppetry aspects of the show and the challenges of adapting this type of ""first person"" narrative to the stage, so if you are looking for a lot on technical aspects of stages it is not as much as you want.  However that being said it does give you a great overall picture of the production aspect from the concept and creation sense.  I can see how the show is so moving and understand even more so I think why this style may be pulled off in England so well.  Some great shots of the show as well.",1370304000,,528,4.207920792079208
8377980,5,B002QW7J6S,It was great watching this before seeing War Horse on stage live.  It helped to understand the intricacies of what it took to make this into a stage production.  It made us appreciate it so much more.,1369267200,,200,4.378378378378378
