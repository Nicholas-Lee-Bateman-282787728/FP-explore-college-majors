8538157,5,B007BA90GW,"This is an unbelievable DVD. Talks about the war between the animal and plant kingdom leading to biodiversity in rain-forests, the fragile ecosystems in North American forests;  grasslands of Africa and Australia; importance of nitrogren in ecosystems...
Being a fan of David Attenborough's series of DVDs I would say this is equivalent and certainly more startling. Enjoy.
