8031882,5,B0002TT06O,"I love this DVD.  I own several yoga and pilates DVDs and this one is a goody.  I have also attended many classes over the years.  I find Megan Miller's guidance to be very clear and as good as the best in-class instructor that I have ever had.  The skill level is beginner, but she demonstrates how to move to higher levels over time with practice.  Each of the pilates and yoga sessions is 20 minutes long which is perfect for me.  I like to do one session, take a short break and then do the other.  Works perfectly for me.  We live in the country and getting to classes regularly is problem, so this DVD frequently comes in very handy.  Keeps me in great shape.  This is my favourite yoga/pilates DVD at this point in time.",1403827200,,727,4.240875912408759
8031883,4,B0002TT06O,"I like these exercises. They are for beginners, and if you decide to remain at the beginners level, these exercises are nice to alternate with aerobics and strength training.  I do modify a little (e.g., I don't breath out through my mouth during yoga, and I stretch during some longer breaks between exercises while the trainer explains) but I do recommend both parts of the CD.  It was easy to follow the exercises when I first started and incessant staring at the screen wasn't really necessary.  The shortness of both training segments (each is about 20 min) allows you to get some exercise in even if you feel you don't have time for it.",1372982400,3,642,4.614035087719298
8031884,1,B0002TT06O,"Was not pleased with this DVD, the exercises and poses were few and very basic.
This video is only good if you have no idea what yoga or pilates entails. If you have ever seen a yoga or pilates session on TV or on the internet, you already know more than what is contained on this video.
The music was very bland and did not match the exercises. In addition, the instructors voice was over powering and too loud.
Bottom line, skip this DVD and find a different one.",1281398400,,465,4.235955056179775
