The group of unknown Vietnamese actors are PERFECTLY led by Clint Eastwood, as the silent, grouchy, proud, imperfect, highly principled American guy we all know--or wish we knew better. Gran Torino is poignant, at times funny, and inspirational. It could be Clint Eastwood's career best, Dirty Harry come full urban-American circle. Shame on you, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. You goofed by ignoring a lot of classics we all love now, and you goofed on this, big time.

7447180,5,B015S4DS1K,"If you are not moved by ""Gran Torino"", something must be wrong with you.  We share Walt's journey from curmudgeon to redemption with both laughs and sorrow.

I disagree with criticism of some of the actors being wooden.  Think about it, how many of us really converse as if we were living a glib, prelearned line, Hollywood dialogue.  We hesitate, gather our thoughts, and continue.

There are several call-backs from Eastwood's previous characters.  ""Get off my lawn"" is delivered like Harry Callahan's ""Make my day"".  He spits tobacco juice like Josey Wales.  He snarls like Will Munny. He delivers ""F**k me"" like Ben Shockley.  Walt is my favorite Eastwood character, as he is a compilation of Eastwood's best.

The Detroit urban blight is captured as ""Gran Torino"" was filmed on location in and around Detroit.  My hometown (Lansing, Michigan) is much the same as Detroit, this is a movie about people and places I know.

Open your heart, open your mind, and let ""Gran Torino"" wash over you.  You'll be glad yo did.",1238544000,4,1019,4.820809248554913

I'm still hoping he'll do a ""retired Dirty Harry in an old folks home"" movie.

7447185,4,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino begins and ends in a church. In between is a tale of bitterness, reawakening, revenge, and ultimately redemption. In other words, this is a Clint Eastwood film.

Gran Torino is a very well done movie, made by one of the most effective directors in Hollywood; if it covers some familiar ground, it is also a departure from this turf. In control on both sides of the camera, Eastwood plays an embittered Korean war veteran, Walt Kowalski, whose wife has just died as the film begins.

Even without his wife's death, Walt could never be accused of being a happy man. He resents his changing Detroit neighborhood and the influx of minorities, personified by the Hmong immigrants who live next door to him. He resents his two sons and their families, especially his spoiled, shallow grandchildren (to Walt's credit I resented them a bit myself; the movie is not interested in making them exactly multifaceted, unless you define multifaceted as managing to be unpleasant, vulgar, and insensitive all at the same time).

If Walt was a more articulate person, there is no doubt he would voice his resentment of America's decline in general, embodied by the decline of the once-great Motor City. He spends his days sitting on his porch, sipping an endless succession of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans, and offering a running commentary, to no one in particular, on the sorry state of affairs.

Meantime, Thao Vang Lor, the teenager who lives next door, finds himself facing his own troubles, as he is pressured by his gang-leader cousin to abandon his books in favor of automatic weapons, aimless driving, and other trappings of gang life. Peer-pressured into attempting to steal his reclusive next-door neighbor's prized Gran Torino, Thao predictably flubs the robbery and is nearly shot by Walt in the process.

The event causes Walt to sit up and take a sharper look at the troubles around him. And little by little - and yet somehow overnight - he becomes a not-especially reluctant protector of the very family whose presence he complained about so lengthily. Sounds familiar? Sure. This is Eastwood territory, and we delight to see him enter it, for no one does it better. Perhaps more than any other actor, Eastwood carries his iconic status with him, in every role he plays. It is unavoidably a part of him - every jaded, raspy word, the grizzled, seen-it-all features, the corded arms and piercing eyes and the slouching confidence he feels for his own two hands and not much else. He could not abandon this if he tried, and we do not want him to.

Seeing three teenage bullies harassing the daughter of the family on her way home from school, Walt watches from his truck, growing increasingly incensed. What follows is no less delightful for the predictability of the track it follows. The truck pulls up, a man gets out. The teenagers bluster and advise him to move on. ""Every now and then,"" Walt replies, ""you run into a guy you shouldn't have f--ked with. I'm that guy.""

Yup, we're in Eastwood Country, all right. And it's good to be there.

As the film goes on, the violence increases as Walt's heart opens slowly, reluctantly, once again, and he is drawn into the life of his neighbors, who hail him as a savior. There are many nice moments here, and these are made more poignant by the shadow which Walt oh-so-willingly moves under. Eastwood can be wonderfully grouchy when he wishes, and the scenes where the two Hmong children try to draw him out of his shell have a light, pleasant feel to them, even if occasionally a gesture or line ring slightly false.

But the good times are not here to stay. This is an Eastwood film, and Eastwood doesn't believe in happy endings. Or, for that matter, peaceful ones. And soon enough an act of loathsome brutality on the part of the gang members spurs Walt into a savage, guilt-ridden consciousness that the semi-playful violence he has so enjoyed flirting with has produced real and insufferable consequences for those closest to him. And with that realization, he heads off to a climax as unavoidable as that in any Western.

Eastwood is older, now, and his body, although still strong, is less vital than in some of his past iconic roles. And so we can only hope that there is enough of Harry Callahan or William Munny left in him to succeed. Does he? Yes, and no. And the ending is a strikingly un-Eastwoodesque ending - until one considers for a moment, and decides that maybe it is a quintessential Eastwood ending after all.

On the other side of the camera, Eastwood turns in a strong performance (does he know any other kind?) but not a true tour de force. In his defense, the script doesn't allow him this chance - while strong, it does not seem particularly inclined to take him into challenging or uncharted waters. Nonetheless, the machine called Clint Eastwood is going strong, and unlike the Motor City itself, he shows no signs of slowing down.",1238198400,4,4914,4.742388758782202
7447186,5,B015S4DS1K,"""Clint Eastwood's GRAN TORINO, ""A White American Tragedy
about Hmong People,"" reviewed in the eyes of a Combat Veteran"" - 5 stars

I returned home from seeing Gran Torino feeling very emotional.  I had to get these feelings off my chest and so is one's veteran opinion about the fictitious Walt Kowalsky, a Korean combat veteran.  I feel I understood what the screenwriter of this fictional story was trying to teach us.  A Chinese American's review seems to be most accurate:  ""You people [reviewers] are, as Walt Kowalski might say, are a bunch of jabbering dimwits.""

For all the reviewers who would rewrite the screen, note that you did not produce this movie which is destined to become an Academy winner.  Some of you expressed that the movie's hero should not have been about a White American but a hero of color -  but isn't that in itself a little racist? The movie is about the story presented and if only the critics could write successfully, they might not be so critical.  Many obvious facts can be easily assumed - so if I say that something is so in this review that was not said in the movie - it did not need saying - I know and many know- especially the vet.

Gran Torino also provides an introduction to the American people of a unique Ethnic group - the Hmong whom Walt at first hated but got to love as his only real family. The story is about an older Korean vet (like most) who came back home worked hard, retired, then lost his wife, and held on to good basic life values.  Likely, he was never offered any treatment for his obvious chronic PTSD - so he has a few personality quirks.  He has the eyes of many aging American combat veterans in a changing American environment.  This movie perhaps is one of the most accurate reflections as to of what has happened to this country since the end of the Korean War.

Walt or Mr. Kowalsky, as he was for his Hmong neighbors, is a real American hero.  We need more Walt's today in this country.  The young Hmong hero (Thoa- Walt's aka ""Toad"") learns to use a calm head when communities face difficulties.  He sets a good example as Walt helps reform him for his attempted theft of Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino that Walt help build on a Detroit factory assembly line.  Sure some Walt comments will get racial purists uptight.  However, I feel many often see a racist under every bed as the problem while neglecting their main issues.  Aren't the objected comments among many Walt-stereotyped blue-collared people more real than not?  Walt did not retreat in war nor today in his community when its racial color changed.  Although he could have moved away as encouraged by his children, he did not go to the suburbs where his former white neighbors and his children escaped.  He stayed.  So really isn't he much less a racist than the overwhelming majority of whites in this country who abandoned their former beautiful neighborhoods - now decaying - that have been overtaken by new ethnic peoples and the poor.  Look at Boston, LA, Detroit and all the big cities!  The movers and most critics do not have to say racist comments, their racism clearly is demonstrated.

So what if he was a cranky old (80 years old?) man often saying things that ""good proper Americans"" should not say.  Our movies need to be about real people instead of an idealist pure people.  The story shows he hated his new Hmong neighbors until he reluctantly discovered that they were good people and who became his new ""family.""  As a 100% disabled combat Vietnam veteran (Special Operation Forces), I know that if you experienced what he did 55 years earlier (killing 13 enemy including a young 17 year old), your perceptions will differ little from Walt's.  After his wife died, he rejected his young priest's many efforts to effect his late wife's request for him to confess his sins. He kept his War secrets to himself.  He never discussed his War story even with his family - keeping his medals hid in a trunk in the basement.  But he did share it for a few short moments with Thao and that is central to the movie's theme.  We know that war takes a tolling affect on all warriors with a conscience- often with daily intrusions until death do them part.  Many veterans perceptions to societal changes are easily different than non-veterans.  Sometimes justifiably experienced in today's world when they see what is happening to their country for which they offered their supreme sacrifice.

The truth is that most Korean and Vietnam veterans have referred to  their Asian enemy as gooks.  Many combat vets are easily triggered emotionally even on the sight of Asians or recollections from that period of their life.  After all, the military inspired within its combat troops that a gook was lower than a dog so that it was okay to kill him unless you allowed him to kill you.  So within the soul of many combat veterans rest this disturbing feeling that is real in their perceptions and often nightly dreams.  Don't we know that ""war is hell"" enough to emotionally to defeat even the best?  Yet these veterans often came home often to an uncaring people who supposedly ""were against war.""  But we should know that the strongest desires for peace always rest with the soldier.  Wasn't Walt trying to teach Thoa and share his experience to avoid violence because it can hurt a person's soul for a very long time.  Yet there comes a time after though when the proper person must take the risk.

Retired White auto blue-collar workers' comments are no doubt a reaction to their  former enemies successful assumption of their American automobile manufacture as Americans adopted foreign cars and left their people unemployed.  It does not seem right for those who won the war to lose their jobs to those we helped (Koreans) or defeated (Japanese, Germans, and Italians).  If that was enough then new foreign people take over their neighborhoods.  [Anyone want a house in Flint MI for a dollar?- there are many available.]  How would you feel if your neighborhood turned into a dump because of this transition? Furthermore, unless you are blind, you must realize that minority Gangs throughout the US have an unduly affect on the poorer inner communities.  These young gangsters are subjected to constant crime and use of drugs with little hope of escape.  Most gangs are comprised- but not exclusively- today of young men of color.  Yes, Walt saw Sue Lor's white male friend unable to stand up for her when abused by a small gang of black thugs.  Walt fought the gang's destruction of his neighborhood and abuse of its Hmong peoples.  If we only had more leaders and judges who stood against this encroachment crime into our society.

Walt knew that neither he nor the Hmong could not depend on the police to help.  He realized that this fight was best for him.  In the same way, many veterans realize that we or our allies should not depend on our military.  This movie is reflects the USA's authoritative failures to not help our allies the Hmong then and today in their new US depressed communities. Look at the story of the Hmong people.  Major General Vang Pao,  their war hero who for two decades led the Hmong in their fight against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces, repeated his comrades story, ""If the United States won't help us, they should drop a bomb on us so we won't suffer any more.""  The story of the Hmong, a primitive people, has been a story of US neglect and betrayal.  They were our most faithful and courageous allies during the Vietnam war.  The USA paid and encouraged them to resist the advance of Communism in Southeast Asia.  But the USA abandoned them and left them to a precarious fate when the Laotian domino collapsed in 1975.  The USA government lied and denied this operation for years until Clinton Administrations confession that the USA was the primary instigating Hmong support in Southeast Asia wars.  Today and after our confession, there still continues a genocide of thousands Hmong by the communist Lao government.  Only a few have been relocated to US Hmong Communities.  Most Hmong have been slaughtered.  These are the same people who covertly made the Ho Chi Minh trail almost impassable for the NVA to resupply military equipment to kill our soldiers.  Their actions saved innumerable lives (US and ARVN) from bloodbaths by the enemy.  Don't we owe them more respect and support?

Are there similar stories going on today in America?  Certainly, we need more Walt's to stand up and help the Hmong.  One example of a White American accused of helping the Hmong is former Ranger Harrison Jack.  The Federal Government today continues his and the Hmong betrayal.  Our US Justice Department has indicted the retired Lieutenant Colonel Jack for a flimsy Sacramento Federal criminal case on violation of the Neutrality Act.  Also indicted in the two year old continuing case are General Vang Pao and ten (10) other Hmong Americans.  Colonel Jack led covert operations and worked with Hmong fighters during the Vietnam War. The federal indictment today describes him as the middle man between the Hmong defendants and their presumed arms dealer.  Rangers are taught to never leave their comrades behind but to make every effort to save them and bring them home safe.  What he is wrongly accused is exactly what the US Government should have been doing to resolve this overdue problem.  The US Justice Department has ridiculously exaggerated and fabricated a case of entrapment at best against Colonel Jack and the Hmong ""conspirators"" to provide arms for those who have not given up the fight.  Perhaps this criminal case will be an exciting future Hmong movie that Clint Eastwood will sponsor.  Knowledge of the facts in this case should also be mandatory reading for Allies of any potential US military operations.  They need to know the USA's propensity to abandon even their strongest supporters facing the worst situations.  Such a movie would make all true blooded Americans disgusted with their government.  It does not have to be fictional - the real story exists.  We never should cause a genocide again.

In the end, Walt gave his life for these Hmong and this Hmong family could live free without intimidation by gangs.  Knowing that he would soon die probably from cancer, he made one last sacrifice plan silently offering his life.  His killing would do much more damage through the jailing of the Hmong gangsters for killing him.  He knew precisely what he was doing.  At last the young priest succeeds in securing Walt's late wife's request a confession.  His confrontation of the Hmong gang would be his final act.  He had made his peace with God with his confession.  As he confronted Sue's and his attackers for their terrible actions, they shot him repeatedly as he reached in his pocket for his First US Army Cavalry (his combat unit) lighter to light a cigarette.  He was unarmed.  And his military memory laid in his dead hand.  He knew that his life soon would be over anyway from cigarette cancer. What better way to go quickly?  Or should he await the slow cancer verdict without any benefit to anyone?  Perhaps he felt the Americans owed more to the Hmong for their faithful valor to the American Vietnam War combat soldiers.  No doubt he had learned from the Hmong of their thousands who died when the United States abandoned them.

His sacrificial offering was for a purpose - similar to that service-people offer for us everyday.  Certainly Walt would continue as one of a very few American hero's to the Hmong.  This movie exemplifies the adage that ""Old Soldiers Never Die.""

Is there a moral that transcends this story even with its many racial or crude Walt comments? You betcha.  There are many morals in this story that might someday be a classic study in schools. While fiction, it offers an excellent sociological and historic story of today's inner city and major issues as to what is going on in this society.  The screenplay's author, Nick Schenk, deserves an OSCAR.  The Hmong are still in need of American heroes instead of our chickens.  Please, Mr. Eastwood,  Give us a second Oscar winning movie about the Hmong's victory in Laos.  Many Hmong still want to go home.

At the will reading, his children got nothing.  Walt left most of his property to the Church of the young priest.  The movie closes when Thoa Lor drives by a beautiful part of Detroit on Lake Michigan with his newly-inherited Walt's prized ""1972 Gran Torino.""  Sue Lor said it right - ""Walt Kowalski is a good man.""",1237334400,6,12517,4.727482678983834
7447237,3,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood does a great job of acting. On the other hand, the movie is marred, as usual in American movies, by things being laid on too thick. Most notably, in the scenes where Clint is trying to teach ""Toad"" how to act like a real American man, the movie got right the way men like to mock-insult each other as an actual show of friendship, but way overdid the ethnic slurs slung back and forthfar beyond how men together would normally behave, I think. Similarly, things escalate between the angry groups more quickly than they would in real life.

If there wasn't the standard Hollywood money-seeking urge to overdo everything operating in the background, this could have developed as the story of a surprising friendship between a crusty old American white guy and the listless teen Hmong boy next door, and how this old guy, who's not long for this world, models standard America business and casual man-to-man behavior that the kid could not learn elsewhere.

A Korean War vet and retired Ford autoworker, apart from his feelings for the men with whom he served, he seems to be something of a misanthrope.  His true partner in life is his dog, in whom he confides everything.  On the material but still sentimental side, he loves his pristine 1972 Gran Torino, having in part fathered it on the line.  As for his 2 sons and their families, his attitude is dismissive and pretty devoid of affection. You name a minority, and his slurs and contempt fire up.  The mere presence of the Asian family next door triggers that unsettling low growl. But he hasn't yet met up with gangs, schooled in warfare, but not this kind.

7447304,5,B015S4DS1K,"I can see why this movie would be boring or even offensive in today's America. That's a shame because there seem to be few of us left that understand. This movie speaks of the human condition and the cure for the existential dilemma that most people have forgotten is even the answer we're supposed to be seeking and takes us a lifetime to come full-circle to, which is-- love thy neighbor.

7447328,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino might not be quite the typically sublime Clint Eastwood directed and acted screenplay most have come to expect, but this only seems to serve the goal of putting humanity unflinchingly on display, flaws and all. Ultimately, this is an excellent film, with a poignant message often intentionally muddled by it's old school grumbling harsh tongued focus. Walt is a Korean war veteran and retired Ford auto plant worker, hence the 1972 Gran Torino. The film opens at the funeral for his wife (she is never seen, but clearly referenced as the better half that tempered Walt) he resigns to a life alone, growling at everyone and everything around him, occasionally accompanied by the barrel of a gun. An unlikely bond forms with an Asian Hmong boy, named Thao, who's family lives in the house next to Walt's. Thao is disillusioned, shy, naive, and standing confused at a classic intersection of good and bad paths. Fighting a losing battle against being recruited by an Asian gang, while facing some harsh realities surrounding him in a tense and troubled mixed culture neighborhood. Just under the surface, you can see a kind and fundamentally good kid desperately in need of guidance. Walt reluctantly takes the role of a mentor. Despite his abrasive exterior, Walt immediately and rather easily develops a fast connection with Thao and his family, even with gravel voiced racial slurs muttered and flying along the way. The film endeavors to point a finger pistol at most, if not all, of the finer points of life, and pull the thumb trigger. Culture and class, young and old, racism and respect, preconceptions and enlightenment, courage and innocence, honor and weakness, morality and corruption, life and death. In this, I think it is a resounding success and a powerful achievement.",1532044800,,1794,5.003344481605351

7447333,5,B015S4DS1K,"The acting was atrocious. But Eastwood took on first time actors for this movie. His mannerisms in all his movies are what sets him apart. In this movie, it's the growl and the scowl. I couldn't believe just how many racial slurs he came up with. They just seemed to pour out of his mouth and yet bounce off the people around him. After a while, Toad, begins to develop character and looks like a little ""Clint"" walking around. Hey, Toad, if you don't ask Yum Yum out, I will. He had me in stitches. After a while, you just fall in love with the cast and when the bad guys show up and do what they do, you call on Clint to do what he does and he gets rid of the bad guys, once and for all.

The story is realistic, painfully so.  I don't want to say too much, because spoiler.  But, getting old sucks, no matter who you are, it just does.  You young people will see.  You think it will be different for you, but it wont.  Money, family, friends, old age still sucks.

But its still never too late to learn, understand others, and do the right thing, before ultimate death.
Its a happy ending, in a weird way.  Check it out, 5 Stars all the way, and last 30 minutes is so exciting.  Its one of those movies you could easily watch twice.",1531958400,,639,4.384615384615385

I was anticipating Clint Eastwood to go out with guns blazing. But it shows so beautifully that to be a man doesn't require bulging muscles, catch phrases, and great violence. It's in the living of one's life according to principle and honesty. I recommend this movie to young men who are going through the roller-coaster that is puberty, college aged men and women who are trying to figure out adult life, and anyone beyond that age.",1531180800,2,594,4.666666666666667

I don't care to google the titles of the other movies he's made; I know one of them was Million Dollar Baby, which was a poorly-written long walk to the sappy tearjerker ending everyone seems to adore.

This movie is terrible. The characters all feel hollow and unlikable, like props. Everything felt very amateur, but not in an indie way. The lighting, framing, propwork, etc all looked very B-Movie. The exception being the cameras which seemed plenty expensive.",1530662400,,671,4.929203539823009

Racism has it gotten better or is it no one has any sense of humor anymore. In my Opinion, this movie portrayed a simple humbleness in character between cultures. The movie portrayed a humbleness that we are not perfect because of sins of our fathers and in us. But in America we can achieve forgiveness with lout out being; persecuted.

7447486,5,B015S4DS1K,"Astonishingly good. It absolutely amazes me that Eastwood can do so much -- and his passion for learning new things at his age.

As an 81 year old codger, he has given me hope that I can retain my ability to learn and to do good things for the rest of my life.

Although their are Dirty Harry aspects to the hero, in fact he is much more complex than Harry, really not at all like him once you get past the tough guy image Eastwood portrays so deeply.

As the priest says, this movie will teach you a great deal about life and death and a little bit about Hmong culture.

Having lived his life the way that society expects Walt eventually finds himself alone with a family which give him little respect and which can't be bothered to get to know him better. His grandchildren came to the funeral of his wife dressed inappropriately and demonstrating disrespectful behaviors and their parents whine about his glaring looks!  They attempt to persuade him to move to senior housing.  A man whose home is his pride and joy with a lawn he mows with a push mower!  And when he attempts to talk to his son about upcoming medical testing his son blows him off. It was beautiful to see the relationship which developed between his Asian neighbors and himself.  A relationship based upon mutual respect and understanding.  I loved how he took the young man to the barbershop to learn how to talk like a man!  Helped him find a job and girlfriend, essentially to grow up.  And eventually gave his own life so that theirs would be free of the local gang.  His character was a man capable of great depth and love but his family only saw an old man with stuff that they wanted for themselves.

7447593,2,B015S4DS1K,"Man, where to begin.
One of the most overrated movies of the last twenty years.

Production Quality was fine, but the Casting was poor, and the Plot was very narrow.
I wonder if this guy just snapped when his wife died, and all the sudden became violent and viciously racist, or if he was like that his whole life.

He must've pulled out his guns everything 15mins, or so.
That's a very romantic notion, for the guys who don't wanna put up with anyone's guff, but it doesn't seem like he would last long in life, constantly prepared to shoot somebody or another.

There's no reason why he couldn't just call the police, in a variety of situations, but the whole movie pretends as though the police don't exist in this neighborhood.
I mean, the gangs had tons of illegal weapons, including an Uzi.

Just bad writing.
I know everyone is supposed to love Clint Eastwood, but there are other ways to enjoy watching a grumpy-violent old white man in a movie.

I thought the movie was very disappointing, honestly.
People wanna draw Christ-like correlations from its ending, but there were many other options, and he ended up wasting his life.

If he really believed in Christ, he would have stopped being so hateful all the time, and cared for others.
Yes, he gave up his life, at the end, but he could have dealt with the situations through the authorities, and continued living, but he counted himself dead already, and that was a waste.

Clint Eastwood has a tendency to do movies about guys that have a dark past, and don't think there's any hope, but they find redemption, through some means or another.
There have been some much greater attempts, on his part, such as ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Unforgiven"", among others, but he really hasn't nailed it, yet.

He really needs to work on the storyboard and the writing of his concepts, because it never quite gets there.
He makes engaging movies, but if we are really talking about reaching the 4-star+ realm, I think the list gets pretty short, there, and Gran Torino doesn't cut it, especially compared to some of his better productions.

P.S.
He should not have sung the song at the end of the Movie! (haha)",1513814400,2,2159,4.616187989556136

Whether you are, or are not, an Eastwood fan, if this movie doesn't touch your inner soul, something is wrong.

Gran Torino lets us know that sometimes outward appearances don't really tell the heart and magnamity of a person.

There are two fun surprises in Gran Torino.  First is the cameo appearance by Clint's son, Scott, who is the current rage.  The other is that Eastwood co-wrote the theme song ""Gran Torino"" and even sings it in the closing credits.

7447728,4,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino is overall an excellent film. Clint Eastwood uses his signature grit to bring a raw element to the already serious themes of life vs. death, friendship, overcoming prejudices, and sacrifice. Walt (Clint Eastwood) overcomes his deeply rooted prejudices about Asians through his interaction with a Mong family. Ironically, it is his knowledge of death that ends the film, while throughout the film the focus is his lesson on how to live.

From a film technique aspect, the director relies heavily on close up shots of Eastwood's face especially. Through these shots, the audience can see the complexity of Walt's feelings, and it highlights the irreverent attitude he has towards those who stand against him. There are several scenes in which the dialogue is limited, but the emotion conveyed is heightened by the focus on facial expressions and alternation between characters.

Gran Torino reveals that your family is not always those who are your flesh and blood, but rather they are sometimes those you are willing to give your all for.",1492646400,,1049,5.093023255813954
7447729,5,B015S4DS1K,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***

There are three movies that, when I'm channel-surfing, always make me stop: ""Unforgiven"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Gran Torino"".  I suppose the common theme among these three are that they are character-driven.  And Walt is definitely a character.

This isn't an easy film to watch.  Walt says and does things that make me cringe, even after having watched this film at least a dozen times.  But the beauty of it is that it's real.  The narrative doesn't sugarcoat Walt's truths.  He is very much the typical Korean War/Viet Nam combat vet.  He did things that few of us can imagine, and those actions are a big part of who he is now.  He is faced with living in a neighborhood where he has become the minority, and the people surrounding him are the same people he fought and killed in the war.  He is not a likeable old man.  Beyond his racism, he has never formed close relationships with his sons.  I've often thought, while watching the film, that his wife was probably the center of the family.  Now that she is gone, none of the men know how to act around each other. While  his sons do seem to worry about him, they are also very selfish and impatient with him, because he refuses to submit to their will.  It is a personal affront to Walt that, after having worked for decades for one of the Big Three in Detroit, one of his sons works for a foreign car manufacturer.  This is symbolic of the family's disconnect.

Through a violent set of circumstances, Walt becomes a reluctant hero to his Hmong neighbors. It is only through their tenacity that he accepts their gifts and Toad's help.  As his walls fall down, he comes to gruffly care for his next-door neighbors, particulary Toad and his sister.  He is not the warm and fuzzy type, but it is lovely to see the depth of his relationship with them.  He becomes their protector, and makes the ultimate sacrifice to keep them safe.

As I said before, this is a difficult film to watch.  Walt says and does things that still make me blush in embarrasment for him.  But his growth is fun to watch, as he learns to appreciate the flavors of Hmong food and banter with and his young neighbors later in the film.  Ultimately, though there is no romance, this is a movie about love.",1492560000,,2268,4.513513513513513
7447730,5,B015S4DS1K,One of his best,1492560000,,15,3.0
7447741,5,B015S4DS1K,"As first glance, Gran Torino, was a film about a racist veteran who refused to change and accept the ever growing world around him. However, after careful insight into the film we can see the story is much more complex and emotional than one might think. The complexity of the characters, specifically Walt, is what makes this film so captivating and permeates the message of care and change than can be made within the most unlikely person.
 The film starts with Walt and his quickly learned racist comments towards anything that is not American, specifically, his neighbors. He has little tolerance for other people and holds strong to his morals and values despite how others may try to convince him. For a majority of the film Walt can be seen as a stubborn, old, American man who would gladly offend anyone who was not the same. However, a change in Walt and glimmer of inner hope was made when he stood up for Thao amongst the gang members. Contrary to what we had seen in the film, this act of kindness, was our first exposure to the man Walt really was and the complexity of his character. From there we see his relationship with Sue, Thaos older sister develop, and he even allows her to call him Wally and goes to their house for dinner. He aside from sitting on his porch and drinking beer, opened himself up to new culture and food.  From these two new connections we then see the role model Walt becomes for Thao. He shows him what a real man is like despite the stereotypes, Walts intention is to create a positive image of what hard work and motivation can get someone. Aside from the openness and being a positive role model, the most interesting facet of Walts character was his romantic side.
 At this point in the film, we had not seen any type of love from Walt concerning another person. His wife had passed away and his two sons were more concerned about the things they could get from their father than his well being. It was not until Walt noticed a young girl that was interested in Thao that we see this love Walt was capable of having for other people. He told Thao that he had the best woman on the planet and if he didn't make a move he would be sorry for it. This is what makes Gran Torino such a great film.
 Walt was not just a one sided racist, White man that we had all anticipated from the beginning. But, a complex man who despite his racist comments, carried about people and as we see at the end of the film was willing to sacrifice himself so that others could live a better life. It takes tremendous acting, film writing, and development of a character to change the attitudes of an audience despite the tone set at the beginning of the film and Gran Torino does just that.",1492387200,,2713,4.409181636726547
7447742,2,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino, on the surface, is an entertaining movie. It features Clint Eastwood and action that provides interest for two hours. Honestly, though, the movie was less than memorable. It was saturated with hyper masculinity and failed to achieve any deeper meaning or themes.
The movie centers around Walt trying to atone for his sins (his detachment from his family, his crimes in Vietnam, and his lack of religious devotion) by becoming a father figure and protector of Tao and his family. The entire film is based on the struggle between Tao and Walt and a gang for Tao's alliance. Walt also helps Tao ""man up"" by forcing him to perform various household chores. The film focuses on Walt's hyper masculinity and makes it a desirable trait even though it nearly severs all of his relationships, because in the end, it is ultimately what saves Tao and his family.
I didn't like the movie because it seemed like just another movie with violence at its center and it didn't really have any memorable characters or moments.",1492387200,,1021,4.806818181818182
7447743,3,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino wasfrom my perspectivea quality film focusing on themes of relationships (familial and nonfamilial) and how they evolve or deteriorate, misconceptions, and racism, the latter the most easily observed but the first the most significant in purpose of this film. While Walt Kowalskis (Clint Eastwood) relationships with his own family members went from weak to virtually nonexistent, the film showcased the evolution of his unlikely friendships with his neighbors, specificially the two children in the family, Thao and Sue. Moreover, the change in Walts views of and actions toward his neighbors is much greater than the typical elderly, grumpy man befriending a young, misunderstood teenager. In Gran Torino, the story is more realistic, less cookie-cutter, and more about dealing with ones own dark past and attempting to avenge it.
 The film juxtaposes drama and comedic elements (although the scene generally regarded as the funniest of the moviein which Walt tries to teach Thao to talk like a man in the barber shopis not humorous in the least from my point of view). It also alternates serious or high energy scenes with mundane or unimportant happenings. Realistically, Gran Torino contained some highly unbelievable scenes and circumstances, most of all the fact that Thaos cousin & his gang devoted so much time and energy to recruiting someone who clearly was not in the least bit interested. Although I am not an expert, I think there wasn't enough thought put into that storyline. Contrarily, Walts story from start to finish was detailed, incredibily realistic, and attention-capturing.
 As far as the cinematic elements of Gran Torino, the film consisted of a little bit of great acting and a lot of slightly better than mediocre acting. When Thao was locked in the basement yelling to be let out at the end of the film, however, this was honestly the most cringeworthy acting performance I have ever seen. This being a rather important scene for the film made it unfortunate that it turned out so poorly, but otherwise the role of Thao was well-played, and I still think the rest of the acting was mostly adequate especially in the roles of Walt and of Sue. Additionally, the characterization of Walk Kowalski was exceptionally strong. He had a well-explained background from the begining and developed significantly throughout the movie. On the other hand, thats where that ended. None of the other characters had even close to similar amounts of significance put into their characterization. Another drawback to the production of the film was, in my opinion, far too much unimportant dialogue and far too many insignificant scenes. This made take almost 2 hours what could/should have been only 90 minutes that would have accomplished the same thing and still included all the important parts. Lastly, one well accomplished cinematic element in the film was lighting. When not carefully watched, the filmmakers can make the audience subconsciously feel the reality of the darkness of Walts past but for unknown reasons. When carefully watched, it is easy to notice how the filmmakers use a lot of low key lighting in shots with Walt to make him less illuminated than other characters becuase of the darkness in his life. This lighting is an important element throughout the film in continuing the characterization of and the contrast between characters.
 Overall, I enjoyed Gran Torino, and it is definitely an easily watchable movie. Still, it is equally certainly a one-time-only movie, and I doubt I will remember it for long.",1492387200,,3557,5.139896373056994
7447744,4,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino tells of a Korean War veteran whos the only American left living on the street while other families and people from different cultures move in around him. He is represented throughout as a tough, worn, old man whos had enough of the people around him, constantly telling tales from the war to establish this. The plot develops, with a linear structure, as he decides to help the Hmong family that have moved next door and end the terrorization from relative gangsters.

A particular scene which is powerful and emotional is the one where Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) confronts the gang members outside their house at night.

An establishing shot made at a low angle is used showing the audience the gang members house with Walt walking towards it from behind the camera to the right. This makes Walt look more intimidating and more powerful than the gang he is going to confront. The shot uses very low-key lighting, but some light is used to highlight what the audience need to see. Crickets and general noise from around the neighborhood such as a dog barking and people shouting can be heard very faintly. This bring across to the viewer that the place he is at is not one which most people would like to go. A quick one second shot is then shown of Walt looking at the house, only his face properly lit. It cuts back to a shot from behind him, the camera moving towards him very slowly. This creates tension and builds the suspense for the viewer.

The gang members begin talking with Walt and the camera cuts back to a wide shot of him. In the background neighbors can be seen coming out of their rooms onto their balconies to see what is happening outside. This may give the viewer the impression that nothing will happen because people will witness it. It could also be interpreted that this is the final show down and the audience, the neighbors, are waiting for it to commence. The leader of the gang pulls out a weapon; Walt still insists on insulting them and standing up for others. This attitude has slowly developed throughout the film which shows that deep down he is genuinely a good man.

The conversation between the two parties continues as several shots of neighbors coming out of their homes or looking out of windows can be seen. This is to emphasize a point which is made clear later on. After asking if anyones got a light, the non-diegetic sound of drums comes in to bring across a military feel for this part. The short rhythmic roll of the drum only lasts for a few seconds at which it then turns to a single string instrument just as he begins talking again. Under this, the diegetic sound of the neighborhood can still be heard, giving the sound more depth within this sequence. When saying Ive got a light, he slowly begins to reach into his jacket pocket. The string instrument goes up a note and the rhythmic snare comes back in. This is all to help to build the tension for the audience, another popular technique used in cinema.

Walt then reaches into his jacket and quickly withdraws his hand. In doing this it startles to gang members and they believe hes pulling out a gun. The soft tense music then stops with the harsh and violent sound of gunfire. The gang begin shooting at Walt and shot of his torso is shown as bullets fly into him. This is slowed down slightly to show the impact while the gunfire continues very loudly. A shot from behind him is shown with the bullets leaving his body. This is proving to the audience that theres no bullet proof vest and the lead character is dying before them. Cuts are made to show the gang members still shooting at Walt even though its obvious he wouldnt survive. The camera uses a large depth of field to show everything that is happening.

A cut to a medium shot is used to show Walt being gunned down. This shot is used as a reaction shot because its confirming for the viewer that hes dead. Cutaways of the gang continuing to shoot are seen as it cuts to the next shot of Walt falling down eventually in slow motion with the sound of air brushing by him to emphasize the fall. The camera doesnt move in the shot, it is Walt leaving the shot, another way of emphasizing the fall.

With a still medium shot, Walt is seen falling down onto the grass face up. As he lands the faint sound of his last breath can be heard. Both of his arms lay out either side of him, thus letting the audience see what he did draw from his jacket. The deep focus is changed to bring his hand focused more into the foreground and as his hand opens up, the viewer can see it was the lighter that he was given buy the service while in Korea. In this part, his hand is the most well-lit part of the screen. This is obviously because it is a message to the audience. Its almost as though the director is literally telling the viewer what is happening, even though the audience can understand for themselves.

A medium shot is again used, but this time from an aerial perspective. This shot starts at his hand and them begins panning across his body slowly, slightly turning to give the shot a better look compositionally. Here the audience can see the way Walt is laying with his arms out either side. This is the only part of the movie I didn't like because it seems to emphasize the White Savior Walt personifies with him being sprawled on the ground in the shape of a cross along with light piano music in the background that almost sound like church music. I don't mind the fact that Walt saved Thao and his family, but I don't like the impression it gave that it was due to the actions of a white Catholic man.  Its almost as if the film is saying that Thao of the other Hmong people in the community couldn't achieve their freedom without ""the efforts of good white people"".

Clint Eastwood is one of American films greatest legends both on screen and off. Eastwood is the one responsible for the creative processes that made the finished product. In Gran Torino, this can be seen because of the frequent use of shadow lighting and camera positions. Overall, its a good film made by Clint Eastwood that would be worth watching when you have free time.",1492128000,,6133,4.462979482604817
7447745,4,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino explores the role of a hardnosed traditionalist in the face of change. Walt struggles to open up, but succeeds when he steps into play an important role in the life of his young neighbor, while also gaining some lessons of his own.

The film did an exceptional job highlighting the difference in culture between Walts classic American values and his neighbors Hmong culture. Walt, an isolated old man. He has recently lost his wife, although he seemingly lost his family in closeness some time ago. His adult sons and their families have no connection to him and is seems that Walt has done nothing to encourage a real relationship in the first place. He is completely alone. Compare that to the situation the next lawn over. His Hmong neighbors are a close family. The grandmother, mother, daughter, and son all under one roof, hosting parties and celebrations seemingly every weekend. The food is always flowing and so is the conversation. The two scenarios are in stark contrast to one another. Gradually over the course of the film, Walt lets himself experience the culture and eventually change some of his ingrained prejudices (although never his derogatory language).
One aspect of the film that resonated with me was the use of sound, or rather the lack of it. The film has no noticeable soundtrack. Every scene is about the dialogue. There is never a musical score manipulating an audience. It was about the content of the scene and the audiences feelings about it. I thought this was an interesting film choice and the decision was punctuated even more by the only song being sung by Eastwood, himself, after the final shot of the film.

Overall, despite questionable acting by some in supporting roles and the possibly over-the-top racism, I appreciate the unforgiving stance the film took. Gran Torino is a solid study in character development and cultural exploration.",1492128000,,1893,4.949685534591195

7447764,5,B015S4DS1K,I love this movie on so many levels. First he is a veteran. Seond he has lost his wife and his children are not really around at all. He spent his life working to support the family and did not make relationships. However his children took that support and did not make a relationship either. His neighborhood is changing and yet he maintains his home as if his wife were still there. He eventually crates a relationship with two young neighbors that is what relationships are all about. Most of all once he finds that he is dying he gives his life for those neighbors freedom from persecution by a nasty gang. No greater love. Meanwhile his family is greedy for his original Ford Gran Torino. Realistic in family dynamics today especially the part of vultures after the funeral. The kind of family that cannot be bothered unless they want something while you are alive and right there to shop through your belongings at death. Well acted.,1490227200,20,939,4.62874251497006

Certainly the ethos of American sacrifice from the 20th century for make the world a better place and what America has become in spite of the sacrifice are large elements of this film.

The only gangs in the US are either latino or black. Asians and Indians are serious about work and school. They are hardly ever criminals. Makes a few good points about sacrifice and family values but was so condescending even to the Catholic Church. It had a Christ centered message as Eastwood sacrifices himself to fight the evil gang and dies like Jesus Christ to teach a newly ordained priest about the true grit that real Christians need but Eastwood is so rough around the edges drinking all day and bring grumpy that you wouldn't expect him to be religious. But he's like a war guy so it reminds me a little of the movie ""Fury"" which had some really immoral guys fighting evil with a Christian message.",1474848000,,846,4.5359477124183005

7448099,5,B015S4DS1K,"This recycles Eastwoods' oevre into one of his more gritty roles,
a definitive chip on the shoulder role.
He has pulled this one off, again, as he's the pro, that can render
a well crafted script of cultural clashes and generational misgivings.
The Hmong families next door spark a catharsis in this Korean war vet,
whose most venal sin(s) is his '72 Gran Torino, an icon by itself that eventually
gets re-purposed to a young Hmong neighbor teenager who was able to lift
Eastwood's character to new heights of ethos and insights that eventually cost him his
life in an act of noble resistance.  One of his and Malpaso's better efforts,
that is on par and probably transcends his all time iconic role as Dirty Harry.
Should you watch this? Hell yes, it's classic, vintage Eastwood.
Forget about his 'empty chair' politics for an hour and a half.

7448206,5,B015S4DS1K,"This movie touched me in a special way.  We originally saw the movie at the theaters and walked out saying we have to buy the DVD as soon as it's available.  Eastwood directed and starred in this amazing movie about prejudice, family and honor.  I won't go into details, I don't want to spoil the movie's plot for anyone who has not watched it yet.

I've watched it at least four times and it's as good now as the first time.  I can't help from crying at the ending and I'll never see a Gran Torino without thinking of this movie.  The title may reference an automobile but this movie is about life and rising up to the good that exists within even the most hardened and hurt human being.

Highly recommended.  Great movie.",1469232000,,723,4.343283582089552

7448250,5,B015S4DS1K,"Good all around movie. Eastwood knows how to project the tough guy persona, no matter what kind of character he's playing.  He's perfect as a Walt Kowalski, a crotchety old racist. I love how he comes to be a bit nicer to his neighbors after Thao, his young neighbor, tries to steal his prized Gran Torino and Walt decides to kind of take him under his wing and teach him to be respectful.  He realize that Thao really isn't a bad kid, just pressured to join his cousin's gang. Kowalski refusing to be fearful of the gang is a highlight of the film Another highlight is Ahney Her. Her portrayal of Thao's sister, Sue, is adorable.
The gang is relentless and Kowalski, once he realizes he has a serious health issue, finds the perfect way to take care of the gang, even though it means he pays a heavy price.
Still, it's an exceptional movie and a testament to Eastwood's artistic talents.",1468108800,2,888,4.4753086419753085

It was made in 2008 before our society became totally obsessed and blinded by the absurd amount of political correctness that exists now. It probably would not be filmed in today's climate of intolerance disguised as inclusiveness.

I loved the character Eastwood plays, even though he seems mean, and uncaring, he is and was the hero that came back from Korea and worked to house, feed, and put his kids through cool.  Unfortunately the children have no idea who he is.  He plays the quiet gentle war hero, who does not tell his horror stories but keeps everything hidden from his family.

I guess it never ended for him and he felt that the best way to go out is like a hero.",1456185600,2,502,4.091836734693878

7448735,5,B015S4DS1K,I heard about this movie from dad so I decided to watch this and omg I cannot wait until I buy this on dvd. I enjoyed the movie because it was telling you what is really going on in some neighborhoods and how some families only want you for what you have got instead of enjoying being around you. This movie showed how you need to have an act of love to the most extreme degree in order to help some from going down the wrong path. I give this 5 stars and two thumbs way up.,1444435200,4,474,3.8969072164948453

7448760,3,B015S4DS1K,"Not the best Eastwood movie ever made. The acting is pretty awful overall, a lot of gratuitous violence, and minority males acting with machista bravado and arrogance. It's a sort of ""Dirty Harry in retirement"". Clint plays crotchety retiree whose Detroit neighborhood has gone to chit, as most have here, kind of reminds me of mine. Anyway, being the redneck, racist, pollack stuck in his declining neighborhood, Walt, hates his Hmong neighbors and has little to do with them, until... well watch and see what happens...The ending is kind of sappy and forces one to feel sorry for Walt...I won't spoil it for you if you decide to actually see this. If you don't want to waste your money, and are dying to know how it ends, send me a message and I'll tell you. Clint delivers some funny one-liners and has some cute, if not tender interactions with his Hmong neighbors when he softens up and decides they are not just a bunch of wacko zipperheads.  Otherwise it's very similar to his Dirty Harry movies.  I would rate this ""D"" for dull...What does the car have to do with the movie?

7449014,4,B015S4DS1K,"""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while that you shouldn't have f...cked with?  That's me.""

At first blush ""Gran Torino"" may seem like a ""Grumpy Old Dirty Harry.""  Indeed, starring and directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie's main character bears a superficial resemblance to the one in the ""Dirty Harry"" films, and early rumors about it implied that it was actually a story about the cop's retirement days.  Nope.  ""Gran Torino"" is far more sentimental than any Harry Callahan flick, and the main character in ""Gran Torino"" is far grouchier than Harry ever was, yet, remarkably, far more human.

Even more remarkable, I read recently that ""Gran Torino"" is the highest-grossing film Eastwood has ever made, remarkable when you consider he's done things like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Mystic River,"" ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" and ""The Changeling"" to name but a few in addition to the ""Dirty Harry"" series.  I also understand that he's said ""Gran Torino"" would be his last film as an actor, preferring to remain behind the camera from now on.  Our loss if he does quit acting.

In ""Gran Torino"" Eastwood plays a retired autoworker, Walt Kowalski, now pushing eighty.  His wife has just died, he's got lung cancer, and he lives alone in the same neighborhood he's lived in for heaven knows how long.  He and his two sons and daughters-in-law barely speak, and he has no use for modern society's newfangled ways.  The main reason he's alone, though, is that the world has passed him by.  He longs for the good ol' days, when people were more conservative and less racially varied.  Now, he finds himself encompassed by Southeast Asians, whom he distrusts, having fought in Korea.  He chooses to keep to himself and considers his neighbors barbarians.

The first half of the movie shows us Walt's macho, ill-tempered attitude and his racist, hate-filled sentiments toward the surrounding populace, much of his outlook so excessively overboard it's amusing in its exaggeration.  We shudder at Walt's stupidly blind prejudice, yet we can't help laugh, too, sometimes out loud, at the outrageousness of his behavior.  For any clear-thinking, open-minded person these are guilty laughs, to be sure, but laughs nevertheless.

Walt is lonely and unhappy, his only friend his barber (John Carroll Lynch), with whom he has several scenes, the second of which is among the few that fail to ring true.  He might have remained alone and sad, too, if he hadn't inadvertently met his neighbors, a Hmong family, when one night the boy, Thao (Bee Vang), tries to steal his prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport.  The Gran Torino represents everything Walt remembers good about the old days:  It is big and bright and sleek and powerful, a symbol of America's dominance not only in the world of manufacturing but in everything else, from power to culture to civility.  The idea of a ""foreigner"" trying to steal the car characterizes his worst fears about what has happened to his country.

Walt runs the boy off, but then something odd happens.  When he finds out the boy lives next door, he decides to try to rehabilitate him when the kid's parents make him work off his debt to Walt.  Then, as the old timer and the boy begin interacting, Walt finds the boy is not so different from any other kid after all, and Walt starts to take a greater interest in his well being.  What's more, the boy's older sister, Sue (Ahney Her), who is in college, decides to rehabilitate Walt.  She ignores his gruff exterior and invites him into her family's world.  In addition, the Kowalski's family priest, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), also takes an interest in Walt after Walt's wife dies; the priest is a young fellow, well meaning and persistent, who never gives up on the old man.  I told you the story was sentimental, and the results are inevitable, with some truly sweet relationships developing.

Eastwood's well-known grimace and scowl find themselves on full display in the film, possibly to greater advantage than ever before.  He becomes the embodiment of the tough guy with a heart of gold beneath the rough, weather-beaten facade.  Bee Vang's boy next door is quiet and shy yet inwardly strong; we can see the potential there for a stable future.  Christopher Carley's priest could have been another clich, but he turns out to be anything but.  His character proves as resilient as Eastwood's.  In any case, the real standout is Ahney Her's role, the older sister.  She's feisty, smart, and determined to be a friend to Walt, no matter what.  It's hard not to fall in love with her charming yet firm disposition.

Of course, most films insist upon stronger conflicts than mere differences in cultural values, and ""Gran Torino"" is no exception.  So we get a subplot involving gang wars and street thugs and such, culminating in a typically histrionic movie ending that probably won over audiences but doesn't do a lot for its credibility.  You live with it and accept that the movie is going to have an even stronger social message than you might have anticipated.

Trivia notes:  I've read that Eastwood did not initially intend to play the part of Walt Kowalski himself.  He had several old friends in mind, like Gene Hackman or Robert Duvall, but neither actor was available, so he did it himself.  Also, Eastwood is not new to a Gran Torino; he drove one in ""The Enforcer.""  And the name of the main character here is not only the same as the main character in the muscle-car movie ""Vanishing Point,"" it was the name of a famous real-life wrestler, Walt ""Killer"" Kowalski.

Video:
The Warner video engineers do a pretty good job bringing the picture to life in Blu-ray high definition, using a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 for the 2.40:1-ratio movie.  There's a fair amount of natural film grain present and a generally pale aspect to the image, both of which I remember from the movie theater, that the engineers wisely leave alone.  It means the film has a somewhat subdued look to it, yet there are also deep black levels and some fine detail beneath a slight veneer of softness.  While the picture is not crystal clear, you can see every line and wrinkle on Eastwood's face and neck.

Audio:
The English soundtrack comes in lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and regular Dolby Digital 5.1, the TrueHD being the default so you don't have to worry about switching to it at start-up.  It displays a clear, clean midrange; strong dynamics and bass when necessary; a very wide front-channel spread; and a good, though subtle, use of the surrounds, mostly for environmental sounds.  The audio is not spectacular or flashy in any way, but it is realistically effective.

Extras:
Among the few extras (all in high def) on this Blu-ray disc is a Blu-ray exclusive, ""The Eastwood Way:  Exploring the Actor/Director's Filmmaking Process Up Close.""  It's about nineteen minutes long and provides a behind-the-scenes look at how Eastwood made and starred in the movie.  Next is
""Manning the Wheel:  The Meaning of Manhood as Reflected in American Car Culture,"" around nine minutes on everything the automobile symbolizes in the film; and ""Gran Torino:  More Than a Car,"" a four-minute segment on cruisin' in Detroit and the joy and excitement of owning very special cars.

Then, we get twenty-nine scene selections; a digital copy compatible with iTunes and Windows media; pop-up menus; a slipcover for the disc case; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Although we see an embittered Walt Kowalski preoccupied with a personal dreamworld that is no more, we also see a genuine human being under the surface, and one who comes around in the end.  That ""end"" may be overly melodramatic, but along with the movie's uplifting message of hope, it's surely what sold it to viewers.

It's always nice to see a character reversal in a story, as Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" has shown for over 150 years.  Walt is a sort of Scrooge for the modern age, with a rather overemphatic wallop to punctuate his conversion.  While it may sound trite for me to say the movie will make you laugh and cry in almost equal measure, make you squirm, make you cringe, and make you happy at the same time, ""Gran Torino"" does, indeed, do all of these things.  It is perhaps not a great movie, but it is surely a crowd pleaser.",1433376000,,8454,4.850069735006974

7449140,5,B015S4DS1K,"It's not often that an aged cinematic icon can quietly step onto the screen, hold you captivated, and can just as quietly leave you with a torrent of emotions.  This film truly shows what makes Mr. Eastwood such a powerful and lasting actor/director...and that while others may ""lose it"" as they age, the older he becomes, the more heartfelt and personal he becomes with his audience...the older he becomes, the more of his personal artistry matures and touches you.  The beauty of this specific film is that it captures with incredible sincerity and ""bluntness"" the search for direction in life and means to show that you truly have value.

CONTENT ISSUES:
This film is rated R for only one thing...language.  Walt Kowalski is a man with a very hard and uncompromisingly sharp tongue.  Straight up expletives and slurs come forth from his mouth.  Yet despite that (or rather because of it) the glory and genius of the film really stands out and leaves you with hope and love.  Outside of language, there isn't much else to find troubling in the film.

PLOTS/THEMES (ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS):

I won't bore you with a detailed plot explanation...I'm sure that both the ""official synopsis"" and other reviews have covered that pretty well.  In short, this film is about an old embittered-man-who-has-seen-far-too-much meeting a young and directionless teen-who-has-seen-far-too-little.  The plot really is that simple, but the beauty is in the journey we get to witness as these two figures come together; and how they engage the various themes of life that all of us face and can relate with. The thing about this film is that it is a very quiet (for the most part) look at life.  It is a coming of age tale.  It's a story about family.  It's a narrative about hidden goodness...and a lovely picture of what it means to find life again.  All the actions and scenes are simple (eating lunch together, having a barbecue, doing chores, etc.) and yet this proves to be one of the most heartfelt compilations of ""events"" that I have ever seen in film.  Tears will be shed and hearts touched for the better.

But probably the most impactful bit for me was in how the film tackled the idea of ""words"".  In an age where we often have to choose our SPECIFIC words carefully and find ways to dance around emotional minefields, ""Gran Torino"" reminds us that a words value (as well as it's power to uplift or tear down) comes from the intent of the one speaking...not so much the specific word used.  Eastwood's character is a man with a colorful bit of language to put it nicely.  Though his choice of words never changes even by the end, yet there is a difference...a difference that even turned what people consider these days as vulgar words into terms of endearment that you would want to hear time and time again.

Another thing that caught my attention was how such a small cast of ""main characters"" can do so much in befriending the audience.  But perhaps it was this tightness that brought out such a ""family-like connection"" between cast and audience.

The other really impactful piece of this film was how it handled inter-racial bonds and connections.  A lot of modern films that bring this theme/issue to the forefront have often times been gratingly heavy handed, or blatantly preachy (in the worst sense of the word).  And often in the end, someone must be forced to change and be limited so that the other will find equality/gain rights.  But ""Gran Torino"" tackles this issue in the most brilliant way...by not tackling it at all.  While watching this film, you completely forget about social categorizations...and you know, that was probably the idea.  You just see a man and a boy.  You see a family and you see friends.  You also see enemies and bullies.  In the end, the deeds made the man a man...and the deeds made the boy a man.  And that their is the beauty and secret of it.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
There are two special features included in this package.  Both of which are documentaries: ""Manning the Wheel: The meaning of Manhood As Reflected in American Car Culture"" as well as ""Gran Torino: More Than a Car"".  Honestly, though there are some nice bits in each of them, they really seemed subpar...especially in relation to the scope of the actual film feature.  You see, the documentaries didn't really relate too much to the movie at all.  The focus/connection to the main film was not their at all.  The documentaries focused so much more on superficial things and cars, while the actual film dealt with deeper issues.  And many of the questions asked when they interviewed the cast was rather lackluster.  It just didn't compliment the film all that well.

ALL IN ALL:
This is one of those films that I believe everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.  Clint Eastwood and the rest of the cast are on point.  The way they capture the beauty in simplicity is mind-boggling.  And the themes are so relatable and down to earth.  The sometimes brutal honesty is refreshing, but the knowledge that there is still hope and good is even more powerful.  Honestly, this is a hard film for me to truly express in words because there are volumes worth to discuss about the film and its personal impact (which is funny because of how simple it is).  But it is definitely one film I do recommend with the utmost regard.",1428192000,,5336,4.700431034482759

7449225,5,B015S4DS1K,"Walt is a salty kind of a guy, mostly gristle. Widowed and bitter that he can't get along with his grown children, and upset that the neighbors have mostly moved out and foreigners have moved in. He was awarded medals for valor in Korea, but he doesn't talk about that much. He came home from war and raised a family, working until retirement for an auto manufacturer. His prize possession: a 1972 Gran Torino in mint condition.

A local Hmong (highlands of Vietnam) street gang in town tries to initiate their young cousin Thao, who lives next door to Walt, to steal his prized car. Walt catches him and it shames his family. They make him work for Walt to pay off his debt. The two become friends, so much so that Walt takes him under his wing as a son.

Violence follows Thao's framily because he failed to pass inititation and he is blowing off the gang in favor of this white guy. Walt is a rough character, completely predjudice in his speech, fluently using racial slurs. What ends is the dearest form of love ever expressed. You have to watch it. I won't spoil the ending. This is perhaps Clint Eastwood's greatest movie.",1424736000,,1129,4.5024390243902435

It doesn't have a whole lot of violence in it, which surprised me for a modern-day ""gang"" movie.  Eastwood does a good job playing the grumpy old man next door.  It is a bit of a leap to believe he would become so protective over his next door neighbors, but again, this isn't a deep movie.  I love very end...but then, I like the muscle cars just as they rolled off the assembly line, so I think the car is beautiful (it could have been shown even more as far as I'm concerned).

7449293,1,B015S4DS1K,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Over-the-top violence, obscenities, and racism -- which seem more about shock value than anything else.  It's manipulative of the emotions, assaulting the viewer with atrocious racism, violence, language, etc.

There's purportedly redeeming value in the film,  but even this is unsatisfying (e.g. the main character's confession, and yet he doesn't confess his main sin.  As a Catholic, not confessing a mortal sin sends a person to hell).  It's basically a violent movie under the auspices of having redeeming value, though I didn't see any, even in the ending.

It also depicts racism at a level that seems very unrealistic to me.  The language is ridiculously over the top and excessive and repulsive.  Many of the characters, for instance, Clint's family and the Hmong gang,  seem contrived and stereotypical.  There's also no reasonable explanation of why the Clint character is so racist and angry.  Many soldiers endured the Korean War without becoming so mean and angry and racist.  And the Korean War was considered at the time a valiant war.  It wasn't until Vietnam that war was viewed in such negative ways.

There is nothing subtle or likable about this movie.  I found it distasteful, and have been trying to wipe the horrific violence from my mind.",1420675200,2,1306,5.004651162790697

7449412,3,B015S4DS1K,"If you are in search of an Eastwood film that is themed similarly to Million Dollar Baby (meaning: it is an emotional film) and has Eastwood acting like an aged Dirty Harry, then this film is what you're looking for. Actually, include a hint of a Death Wish-esque plot (yes, I know that's Charles Bronson).

I finished the movie because I paid $2.99 to watch it, but by the end I was glad I lasted all the way through. Minor twist at the end that, if you pay attention to the clues throughout, you will likely be able to predict. If you're looking for the great Western-style shootout at the end, you'll find this interesting.

If I could turn back time, I would just watch Dirty Harry or Hang 'em High again but, oh well. Eastwood is the only decent actor in this film, but he's really just playing the character you expect him to play, so I'm sure it wasn't a challenge for him.

OH! If cantankerous old racists really piss you off and you can't enjoy a film that uses racial slurs, skip this. Not that words like ""gook"" and ""spook"" don't bother me, but if this bigoted Korean War veteran didn't use them, it would be unbelievable. I'm pretty sure the word ""Ni**er"" is not used.

7449467,5,B015S4DS1K,"Grand Torino

 Clint Eastwood has been making movies for some 50 odd years.  Every one of those years taught him something about the craft.  We have the benefit of that experience in Grand Torino.  I would have been satisfied to have some sort of reprise of Dirty Harry.  Instead, I got a film of the very highest levels of the cinematic art form.
 Eastwood plays a retired auto worker, recently widowed, who exists uncomfortably in an ethnically changing neighborhood.  I expected Clint to be a tough guy, and he is.  There is the overt story of gang violence in Detroit, the setting.  But the movie is about Christian theology.
 Eastwood is a cranky old Korean War vet with no use whatever for the changes going on around him.  He is proud, casually racist and his other flaws (and virtues) are clear to those around him.  The dying wish of his wife (who we never meet-we only know of her because of her postmortem effects on Clint) was for Eastwood to get right with God and this theme weaves through the other events in the film.  By the end of the movie he has taken powerfully to heart the injunction of our Lord to Love your neighbor.
 This is a hand crafted Swiss watch of a movie, built by an enormously talented man.  Eastwood stars in the movie.  He also directed it.  He also produced it.  He even had a hand in writing the theme song.  And he brought the whole thing together in only 32 days.  The script by Nick Schenk has flashes of humor in just the right sports and amounts.
 Grand Torino is number one this week at the box office, plucking a heroic $10,000 per screen.  It is rated R for language, violence and theme and runs just shy of two hours.  Four and a half saw blades.  Do not miss this movie.",1413158400,,1720,4.367088607594937

7449531,5,B015S4DS1K,"Phenomenal script.
A war veteran apotheosis.  Cures his own karma with a flash solution to the dramatic problem.

The story posits a hard nosed war vet, new immigrants, a young hopeful priest, and a town under siege in gang loyalty.

The car, the Gran Torino is a true symbol of all that was great in America -- according to Eastwood's character -- and it is the most glorious car you'll ever see on film.  Worthy of car shows.

When he teaches his young Hmong neighbor how to be an American worker / American man... it is one of the best scenes in cinema ever written.  Hilarious and true to the core.

forever,
Annie

7449574,5,B015S4DS1K,"Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired former Ford employee and Korean War veteran. Recently widowed, he lives alone in a rather dilapidated neighborhood in Detroit. Walt is angry and antisocial and does not enjoy a good relationship with his family. His sons are self-interested and his grandchildren are disrespectful. One of his few pieces of pride is his 1972 Ford Gran Torino which he helped build. Walt does not like the change in his neighborhood and is initially disgusted when a family of Asian immigrants moves in next door. Cultures begin to clash when Kowalski, a man of a far different generation, is forced to face a different America than the one he grew up in.

I found this movie to be quite interesting and thought provoking. The movie was well written. Eastwood does an excellent job of bringing his character to life as a grumpy old man that faces difficulty coming to terms with the changes around him. Although the Kowalski character is difficult to sympathize with, he shouts many insults and racial slurs throughout the movie, it is easy to understand his frustration.

The DVD itself is rather light, though. The only special features are two short featurettes about cars which add nothing. Despite the title of the film, it is not really about the car.

There is a lot of cussing and foul language in this film but if you can overlook that and see the message in the film you will enjoy it.  The relationship Clint and the young man, Clint's neighbor, develop is brought along very well.
One part in the film I enjoyed was when his neighbors were continually bringing food to his home to show appreciation for his kindness.  Clint at first tries to shoo them away because so much food has already been given to him.  He then discovers one of the dishes is something that he really likes, the result is he allows them to come in his house.  That is a funny part.",1398643200,2,900,4.321428571428571

7449683,5,B015S4DS1K,"Walt Kowalski is old school. A Korean War veteran and lifelong Ford autoworker (""Would it kill you to buy American..."") - he snarls at his scantily dressed teenage granddaughter who disrespectfully texts someone while attending his wife's funeral. He spits on his next door neighbour's front lawn because it's not as spic and span as his own - and looks close to punching out the well-meaning but life-nave local young priest Father Janovich who just wants to 'help' after his wife's passing (dialogue above). And as the American flag flies over his home - Walt and his dog Daisy sit on the porch not suffering anyone let alone fools gladly - while drinking brews and cursing the rubbish printed in the Astrology section.

His middle-aged sons Mitch and Steve live as far away from him as possible (Michigan mostly) and despair of his grouchy growling nature - permanently frothing at the state of the America he fought for in 1952's E-Company Platoon. He calls people in the Chinese and Mexican neighbourhood gooks, spicks and swamp rats. When a crowd of well wishers descend on his home for his wife's wake - he snarls ""I guess they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham..."" Walt Kowalski isn't the nicest person in the world. Yet despite his war ghosts (""The thing that haunts a man the most is the thing he isn't ordered to do..."") - Walt has decency in his veins and values in his still-alert mind. And with rifles to fend off intruders - he's kept pristine an American classic car in the garage adjacent to his Detroit home - a 1972 Gran Torino Sport built by his beloved Ford.

Meanwhile gangs of Hmong and Mexican dudes cruise the streets in cars with guns and semi-automatic rifles looking for trouble or an opportunity to steal something. Walt's immediate neighbours are Hmong - and he snarls at them too. Amongst their large number is older sister and younger brother Sue and Thao. A cousin called Spider in a Hmong Gang has been trying to groom the young Thao - until one day Walt intervenes with his rifle and saves the young boy. To his cringing horror the gook neighbours he was offing all those decades back begin to shower him and his porch with gifts of gratitude. But again - despite their best efforts - he tells them to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.

One afternoon as Sue (wonderfully played by Ahney Her) is walking home with a wannabe hoodie white boy called Trey on a sort of date - they are set upon by three youths with bad intent towards her. Walt is passing in his truck - sorts them out with a handgun he will clearly use - and gets talking to Sue as they drive back about her 'hill people' and especially her obstinate but dim younger brother Thao (great work from Bee Vang). Slowly he learns of her Asian family's origins (escaping murdering Communists in Vietnam) and likes her spunk. A fledgling relationship begins. A relationship that will see him defend and honour what he once body-bagged with such ease...

Directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson - ""Gran Torino"" features a cast of unknowns and tackles subjects rarely seen on Hollywood billboards. It's masterful stuff with Eastwood as Director and Lead Actor firing on all sixes - getting his teeth into important and relevant stuff. It's also ballsy in its portrayals - and of course what makes his Walt so likeable is that he does speak his mind - does have his own marbles - even if they aren't the most politically correct colours...

The BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout - beautifully film. It's defaulted to 2.40:1 Aspect Ratio so there are bars top and bottom - but even stretched to Full Aspect - it looks properly fabulous.

Audio is Dolby TrueHD, English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 5.1, French 5.1, German 5.1, Italian 5.1, Castellan Spanish 5.1 and English 2.0 Audio Descriptive Service. Subtitles are English, Complex Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Castellan Spanish and Swedish (Movie and Bonus Material). Extras include ""Manning The Wheel: The Meaning Of Manhood As Reflected In American Car Culture"", ""Gran Torino: More Than A Car"" and exclusive to BLU RAY ""The Eastwood Way - Exploring The Actor/Director's Filmmaking Process Up Close"".

Racism is a hard one to get right on film - ""Crash"" and ""The Help"" are stunning also (see reviews) - and Eastwood's contribution is up there with those masterpieces.

Driving home as he warms to his Native American neighbour - Walt says to Sue with a smile -  ""You know what kid...you're all right...""

So is ""Gran Torino""...",1398470400,2,4570,4.744332493702771

At the beginning Walt Kowalski is way overdrawn as is his family.  They are not believable, although Walt is funny.  2.  There also seems to be a belief in Hollywood that you must not only show the audience what is happening but tell them verbally as well no matter how obvious it is.

7449721,5,B015S4DS1K,"As star and director, Eastwood pulls this off as though he were comfortable both in front of and behind the camera.  There's no doubt that he was.

Eastwood's character Walt represents an age of men dying off.  Those were the men who were called away to foreign Far East shores to fight on behalf of our country.  (For the record, I include Vietnam Veterans here as well.)  These men knew a little something about self respect, neighborhood, and friendship.  They took no guff and would lend you their last dollar.

Walt unwittingly is conned by his young Hmong neighbor girl to help her brother grow up.  Thao, called Toad by Walt, is the only male in the Hmong family and has no role model from either culture.  The banter Walt teaches Thao at the barber has got to be both a highlight and pivotal point in both the movie and their relationship.

I go out of my way to get products from GoHastings because the packaging is great, shipping timely, and even ""used -acceptable"" products are gift- worthy.

Which brings me back to why 3 stars.  I ordered two copies of Gran Torino for Christmas.  One for a good friend and one to be MY present under the tree.  Only one came.  Of course it went to my friend.  After the holidays were over, I sent an email to the seller, wondering what the hold up was.  I was even prepared to accept that maybe I'd failed to actually order two copies.  But there it was, ""2"" in my order history.  Much to my disappointment, I never heard back from the seller, nor did a second copy ever come.

Eventually, Walt comes to befriend his neighbors after an incident in which a neighborhood gang tries to steal his Gran Torino, one of his prized possessions.

Eastwood's hardened man's man makes his hundredth appearance--and fits the film quite well.

7449871,5,B015S4DS1K,"THE STORY: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), an elderly white man retired from Ford Motors and living comfortably (if cantankerously) in a quiet Detroit suburb, finds his life suddenly changed forever in ways he couldn't possibly have imagined following the passing of his wife. Alone and estranged from his self-absorbed children (and their even more obnoxious kids), in whom he finds nothing but disappointment, Walt's only source of human interaction (outside of a couple of hours from time to time spent at a neighborhood bar drinking with his fellow retirees), comes in the form of a young teenage boy who's moved into the neighborhood along with his immigrant family from Vietnam. Predictably, Walt Kowalski is anything but pleased to see his concept of the perfect world shattered by a people he does not understand and, in all honesty, simply doesn't really want to understand, for it's far easier to stay in one's shell and remain blissfully ignorant. Turns out old Walt may have as much to learn about himself as he does about his new Hmong neighbors. Bitter at the loss of his wife, estranged from his family and facing life alone now in his twilight years, the widowed Korean War vet is forced to confront his own ingrained prejudices and try to come to terms with the changing face of his neighborhood, his country and, ultimately, himself. He's about to have his eyes opened wide and discover that it's never too late to change.

THOUGHTS: Some reviewers really want to hate on the racist attitude of Clint's character but I gotta to tell you, my mother's side of the family hails from the deep south and that's exactly how a lot of folks from that older WWII generation talk, like it or not. I don't think they really realize how bigoted they sound or come across; many aren't really even particularly hateful or racist, that's just the way they learned to talk growing up, and oftentimes it can be very difficult to teach an old dog new tricks. I love Eastwood's Walt character and it was a treat to see the cranky grump growing even in the twilight of his years, to become a better, more accepting person. Sadly, many won't be able to get past the crudeness of Walt Kowalski's harsh, racially-tinged blue language and his seemingly close-minded, resentful attitude, but being exposed to some of that myself, I can easily look past the gruff facade and see the good heart within. If all you can see is a bigot who uses racial slurs then you're really not seeing anything. Walt reminds me a lot of Archie Bunker. In fact I think those two would've gotten along famously if they'd been neighbors. I saw through Walt's gruff exterior and found a touching message in his story, and I have to admit I got choked up in a couple of scenes and outright bawled like a baby at the end. I honestly NEVER thought I'd ever say that about a Clint Eastwood movie! LOL.

THE DVD: Everything on this widescreen DVD release looks very good, which is to be expected with a new movie. Colors, sharpness and audio mix are all strong and consistent. Not much in the way of bonus features, which is a disappointment, but it's the movie itself that makes this purchase worthwhile. Another powerful performance from a genuine screen legend. 5 STARS.",1387584000,3,3238,4.719081272084805
7449872,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood's portrayal of an aging ornery retiree is believable and the foundation of the film.  Who'd have thunk that Rowdy Yates from the 1950's would have morphed into this great actor.  The story is contemporary and relates directly to the Detroit economy we see today...no fiction here.  Although his character is certainly not a saint, especially early in the movie, he does really turn out to be a good man, if not at all politically correct....this I understand and can relate to.
The Hmoung actors are surprisingly good especially the brother and sister from next door.

Sociologically speaking, this movie is as much a study in the perpetuation of negative social behaviors seen as ""bonding"" processes (using slurs as terms of affection, etc.) as it is about changing how we view other cultures (aka the old war vet finding out the ""fishheads"" next door are actually good people).

7449933,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood has acted in many memorable movies and every time does an excellent job of portraying his character. He is at his best in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski in ""Gran Torino."" Walt is a grumpy, snarly Korean War vet who has just lost his wife. (The movie begins at his wife's funeral, where we get our first glimpse of Walt's acerbic temperament.) A longtime resident of a blue-collar Detroit neighborhood, Walt is upset at its changing character. A onetime white neighborhood, its residents are now mostly the Hmong people, who, as one of them explains to Walt, were strong allies of the United States in their fight against the Vietcong during the Vietnam War. When the movie begins, Walt has nothing but contempt for these people, including the extended family that lives next door.

Over time, and as a result of a variety of encounters, Walt's attitude changes. We see him protecting a Hmong girl from a couple hoodlums, thus winning her gratitude and that of her family. He also befriends a teenage Hmong boy, who wants to go straight but who is being pressured to join a Hmong gang. In the end, he lays down his life for this family that at one time he counted as his enemies but are now truly his friends.

Although ""Gran Torino"" has its moments of violence, none of it is gratuitous. Its message of redemption is unmistakable, and, along with Clint Eastwood's acting and directing, makes the movie worth watching.",1380758400,2,1432,4.724

7450032,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbors, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.

Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the oldman overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbors.

The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.

My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief. A check on IMDB reveals that the male Asian lead (Tao) has not had any other parts since this 2008 classic. That would be unthinkable for any other actor who played opposite the great Clint Eastwood. Alas, thank you Mr Eastwood for doing this much for the underrepresented nonetheless.

7450047,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood, consciously, has created or participated in dozens of films that have defined the word ""male"", warts and all. This doesn't mean he ignores women or downplays their role in the world--far from it. But from the spaghetti westerns to ""The Unforgiven"", from the ""Dirty Harry"" movies to the one being reviewed here, ""Gran Torino"", the focus is on men and how they behave (or misbehave).

""Gran Torino"" is about a ""last man standing"" in a sense. Walter Kowalski (are we supposed to think of Walter Chrysler?) is the last of a generation of white men who supported his family and defined his life in the auto works of The Motor City. But the complexion of the city (pun intended) has changed over the decades. His Gran Torino, which he rebuilt, is his link to the past. How he defends it, and by ""it"" I mean everything he has ever stood for, is a polar opposite of the weak-willed young man next door, Thao. In fact, Walt goes out of his way to teach him ""guy"" stuff, whether it's guy talk at the barber or buying hand tools (not power tools--important difference) or defending himself against thugs. Walt didn't get this message across to his own son but he tries with Thao, which I thought was important. Walt's continued dispute with Catholicism only emphasizes Walt's sense of rugged, male individuality.

Now, Thao's sister, Sue... she's another story. No fear of confrontation for her. She is as in-your-face and brutally honest as Walter. And this is what I meant earlier, when I said that Eastwood doesn't downplay the role of women. Think of Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or Annabeth in ""Mystic River"". Toughness is a universal in Clint's world, it just seems that men need to be reminded of it and how to use it correctly. In any event, ""Gran Torino"" is a great tour de force, a movie that came out with little fanfare, but a huge heart and lot of grit.",1373328000,,1874,4.607784431137724

This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in the past decade. Eastwood plays Kowalski like he is just having a hell of a good time with it. Pulling all the stops out, laying back, and just letting it all hang out. Clint is so good at the role of this irritated pissed-off rachety old bigot that you can't help but love every second he's on screen. Line after line will keep you laughing out loud. Some very funny moments. If this is Clint's last role as an actor I must say he put a nice cap on an incredibly impressive and lengthy acting career. And just when you think you have laughed till your face starts hurting things get seriously powerful and touching. The ending will come as a total surprise. It does not end at all the way you expect it to. I have to say this is the best film I had seen in that entire year of it's release.",1371427200,,1176,4.073275862068965

7450070,4,B015S4DS1K,"My dad was taken with this movie when he watched it on cable TV, so I decided to give it a shot. It was not surprising to me that he liked it; lead character Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) love of tools and respect for hard work is right up his alley. A Hmong family moves in next door to Kowalski, and while he at first wants nothing to do with them, due to his distrust of other races, he is drawn into their world, and becomes a mentor to an awkward teenage boy in the family. Ultimately he gets involved with helping the boy stand up to the Hmong gang that is terrorizing him. Kowalski's efforts to teach the kid how to be a regular guy, Detroit working-class style, are a bit jarringly corny, but the drama builds engrossingly. Ultimately we wind up with a religious message, which could be off-putting, but comes across as real and inevitable. Ahney Her deserves special mention as the boy's sister Sue, a very intelligent teen who has adapted well to the U.S., can relate to Kowalski and is primarily responsible for bringing him round. She is so likable. Hope we'll see more of her somewhere.",1370736000,5,1096,4.45771144278607

7450089,5,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Walt Kowalski is a widower, grumpy, tough-minded, borderline-hateful, unhappy old man who can't get along with either his kids or his neighbors, a Korean War veteran whose prize possession is a 1973 Gran Torino he keeps in cherry condition. When his neighbor Tao, a young Hmong teenager, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Tao's family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them form the gangs that foul their neighborhood.

The cast led by Clint Eastwood (who also directs and produces and co-wrote the title song with his son, Kyle and Michael Stevens, both who also did the music to the film) (in one of his best performances, if not, his best, as Walt Kowalski) is excellent! The directing by Eastwood (who has won 4 Oscars for his work on ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004, which he also produced, directed and acted as Frankie Dunn) & ""Unforgiven"" (1992, which he also produced, directed, and acted as William ""Bill"" Munny), he also did produced, directed, and did the music to ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" (2006) & ""Changeling"" (2008) and produced and directed ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" (2006), and he is also directing and producing the upcoming ""The Human Factor"" (2009 or 2010) is excellent! The story by Nick Schenk & Dave Johannson and the screenplay by Schenk is excellent!

The music by Kyle Eastwood & Michael Stevens (both who also did the music to ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") is excellent! The title song which is performed by Jamie Cullum is hauntingly beautiful and excellent! The cinematography by Tom Stern (who also been Clint's cinematographer since ""Blood Work"" (2002, which Clint produced, directed and acted as Terry McCaleb) is excellent! The film editing by Joel Cox (who won the Oscar for his work on ""Unforgiven"" & has worked with Clint since ""The Enforcer"" (1976, which Clint starred as Dirty Harry Callahan) & Gary D. Roach (who has been working with Clint as an assistant film editor since ""Absolute Power"" (1997, which Clint produced, directed and acted as Luther Whitney), he also did the film editing to ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" & ""Changeling"") is excellent! The casting by Ellen Chenoweth (who also did the casting to ""Changeling"" (which Clint directed, produced and did the music), & ""The Bridges Of Madison County"" (1995, which Clint produced, directed and acted as Robert Kincaid), she also did the casting, recently, to the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" (2008) & ""No Country For Old Men"" (2007) and started casting Coen Brothers' movies in 2000, with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") is excellent! The production design by James J. Murakami (who also did the production design to ""Changeling"" & ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") is excellent! The art direction by John Warnke (who also did the art direction to ""Valkyrie"" (2008) is excellent! The set decoration by Gary Fettis (who also did the set decoration to ""Changeling"" & ""Letters From Iwo Jima"") is excellent! The costume design by Deborah Hopper (who also has been working as Clint's costume designer since ""Space Cowboys"" (2000, which Clint also directed, produced and acted as Frank Corvin, she has been working with Clint when she did wardrobe on ""Tightrope"" (1984, which Clint produced and acted as Capt. Wes Block) is excellent!

When the villains just won't back down, he takes it to them in a surprise ending. I watched it with a 14 and 11 year old.

7450128,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood's film career may be grossly oversimplified into three periods: the Spaghetti Western period, the Dirty Harry period, and the Tom Highway period.

Tom Highway was an aging Marine gunnery sergeant in 1986's Heartbreak Ridge.  Highway struggled to connect with the young recruits in his platoon and the modern world around him.  Basically every Eastwood character in every subsequent Eastwood movie has been cut from that same cloth.  There have been some memorable ones, such as William Muny (1992's Unforgiven) and Frankie Dunn (2004's Million Dollar Baby).

Practice makes perfect.

Walt Kowalski transforms from a bitter old man who hates his neighbors for no reason, to a compassionate man willing to sacrifice almost anything for those same neighbors.  Other characters have similar journeys.  A young priest who cowers behind the pulpit spouting platitudes becomes the spiritual leader God has called him to be.  A rudderless young man finds direction behind the wheel of a 1972 Gran Torino, while Lake Michigan aptly hovers in the background.

A salient feature of a classic film is that the movie does not get worse after multiple viewings.  You still laugh at the funny parts and cry during the sad parts.  Gran Torino is a classic.",1366934400,,1255,5.158415841584159

7450187,4,B015S4DS1K,"Leave it to Clint Eastwood to score on political incorrectness.  Playing grouchy, curmudgeonly Walt Kawolski in his film GRAN TORINO, Eastwood hurls racial slurs and insults by the barrel--and gets away with it.  Why?  Because his Walt Kawolski is very believable; he's a throwback to an era time has passed by, and he's a bystander to a community and a neighborhood so fundamentally changed he no longer recognizes it, and it angers and confuses him.  A widower much estranged from his two sons and their families, Walt's world consists of a modest two-story he's owned for more than 50 years, his dog, and his prized possession '72 Gran Torino.  He's not happy at all his neighborhood is being settled by scores of Hmong immigrants; and he's not about to take any guff from the local Hmong gang wreaking havoc in the area.  He grudgingly befriends a brother and sister living next door (Bee Vang and Ahney Her), which sets the stage for the inevitable showdown with the gang.  And the showdown is a guaranteed heart breaker.

Again, Eastwood's racial snarls and politically incorrect bluntness work so very well because most of us know some seniors who call 'em as they see 'em, feelings be damned.  Yet Walt does go on a journey of his own, as he eventually learns a modicum of tolerance and acceptance.  And, he also has his own existential reflection as he comes to grips with the notion of death.  It's this existential element that leads to the powerful climax as Walt confronts the gang and makes that fatal reach inside his jacket; yet Walt also realizes by paying such an ultimate price he is also saving the only people he truly cares about.  One star off as the film does meander at times in its uneven delivery, yet it won't take away from your enjoyment of Eastwood's tough-as-nails GRAN TORINO edge.

Thank you Mr. Eastwood, you have brought much joy to this gal's life. I have been going to your movies since 1970, at a drive-in. Youngsters run and ask your parents or grandparents what a drive-in is. It was wonderful. OH Wait I forgot.

7450213,4,B015S4DS1K,"I wish I had the half star option, then I would rate the movie 4 1/2 stars. The movie was great. It confronted and demonstrated many concepts of prejudice and intercultural communication and compelled much self-reflection in me as a viewer. As far as plot, not much was cliche', and that is a big plus for me. Movies that I can easily anticipate eventually lose the little entertainment they had. But everything I expected Walt or the Hmong family to do didn't happen and that kept my eyes glued. What keeps me from rewarding the movie a full 5 stars is simply the gang action, or better the lack of it. There was a constant mention of gangs in the movie, primarily referring to that of Thao's cousin, but not much to demonstrate the gang activity of each group. This isn't really a big deal, and might be best that it wasn't added, but it's just something minor that sits with me. Also, it was sort of implied that Walt had left the neighborhood at some point and returned 3 years later. However, it was not very clear as to why he was gone for 3 years. I would like to think it was for military duties, but am not very sure. Lastly, Walt apparently loved his wife very much, but there was no depiction of that love. Perhaps an initial flashback in the beginning of the film (or wherever appropriate) or a testimony from someone who knew the couple well.

This is one of Eastwood's better films, better in terms of The Bridges of Madison County. Granted, there are slow moments in the movie, but it's a great movie in terms of ""reflection"". How one man who grew up in a difficult time, served in the US Armed Forces, and then was belittled by his family and turned aside like an old dish rag, has a remarkable life-changing turn around by befriending who he always considered ""the enemy"".

He is also a decorated Korean War vet who doesn't much like anybody  and more so anyone who is Asian that falls into the category of ""gook.""  Walt also is a big believer of carrying a gun, displays the American flag, and is a big proponent of justice.  This becomes apparent when a Hmong gang threatens the family next door and tries to pursuade the son, Thaong to steal Walt's prize posession, a 1972 Gran Torino.  Walt also happens to be a retired auto worker.  Thaong's family persuades Walt to hire the boy to make reparations for what he has done.  Walt reluctantly agrees and at the same time starts to become a mentor to this young man who is afraid of this gang of thugs but is motivated to work and pick up some of Walt's colorful phrases and become a bit more confident.  Sue, Thaong's sister initially tries to make friends with Walt which he resists at first.  ""Keep your hands off my dog,"" he says as she comes up on the porch.  ""Don't worry, we only eat cats,"" is her reply.  The Hmong gang never goes away and there is a point when Walt can't avoid getting even more involved. Clint Eastwood portrays Walt in a way that I can't imagine any other actor being able to do.  Granted he also produced and directed this film.  It's a good story with several lessons on being a good neighbor, having courage to do the right thing, and reaching out to other cultures can leave you fulfilled.",1357516800,,1665,4.401960784313726

7450312,5,B015S4DS1K,"Eastwood  impeccably plays out the theme of the forsaken and redeemed.  His character, Walt, a grisly racist Korean War vet, is haunted with what he did as a soldier and confounded at his failure as a father.  He knows he is flawed and we see his principles and virtues come to the surface as he confronts basic issues of right, wrong, wisdom, and paternalism with his young Asian neighbor and family. His guidance is eventually transformed into a force of good which allows him to redeem his past sins, all through getting involved with the conflicts of his Southeast Asian neighbors and a strained relationship with a young Catholic priest who is goading his character to repent, for this was his deceased wife's dying wish. As you would expect from Eastwood, he runs any ideas of  right, wrong, good and evil through his facade of racism, self destruction, and intolerance. He knows his life's end is near and as a hero he makes that sacrifice which redeems him personally and leaves us sad and hopeful. Do watch it.",1355875200,2,1019,4.707865168539326

One of the biggest complaints I have heard about this film is the acting. Eastwood made this film focusing on a Hmong (pronounced mung) family living in Michigan - rather than cast Hollywood no-names to inaccurately portray the Hmong, he cast all Hmong actors with little to no acting experience. It really is an interesting story - the Hmong acting in the movie that is - and it made me quite a bit more understanding about the weak delivery on some of the lines.",1355097600,3,652,4.620689655172414

Lines are crisper, and everything is more detailed.  The movie has something of a late summer, old timey yellow tint to it in some scenes, and a washed out look in others, both of which I believe was intentional to give it a feeling of age.  This is in keeping with the main character.  Black tones are deep, providing good contrast.  A number of indoor scenes appear to have been shot in natural light, which adds to the realism.  The sound, while clear, was low--I had to turn up on the volume on my system quite high before it sounded normal.

7450355,3,B015S4DS1K,"This film is overly cliche and a little ridiculous in context. I am sorry but I would have given this 4 stars if this hadn't one of the most predictable endings in movie history. All I can think is Clint was on meds or people around him were saying it was great. I almost shut it off before the credits.

Why would you end a film with such a horrible climax that goes against pretty much what you were trying, or so I thought, to build up the entire film. Sure there was going to be a confrontation. But a whole house of people? Come on man. This is just beyond reality. I was immediately taken out of the film by the end but some of the wooden as hell acting and script surely did not help up to that point. If this is five stars than near anything with a good message is five stars.

The gangs are portrayed as a bit too mindless and Clint himself is too gruff and disembodied to suddenly change ways and start loving and caring for these people. THERE IS NO SUBTLY in this film but with a couple of the better scenes.

I will say the dinner between Clint and the neighbors was a great scene and made the enormous gap in their relationship seem worth the jump. I like scenes like these in films. But this film has far too few of them. I can't give this any more than 2 stars because quite simply it's not that great even besides the ending. I really thought I was in for a masterpiece here and came away quite disappointed. Clint's output has been quite up and down lately in my mind. Films like Mystic River are much better imo, albeit they have the same tendency to annoy with the ending, and ones like these are mediocre because they do not build properly for one and another because of the quality of the acting and script.

Mystic River had a lot of things going for it that this one simply does not. I for one saw the ending in that film to be much more subtle. I wasn't sure of Bacon's plans for Penn's character and to me it was more ambiguous than not. This one is just outright crude. This man has made films as great as The Bridges of Madison County, A Perfect World, and Unforgiven and he has also made entirely overrated stuff like Million Dollar Baby and tripe like Space Cowboys. You never know what you are in for but it seems in his old age he likes those shocking endings. This one is not as bad as Baby but I can't say I enjoyed it that much. That's how she goes.",1349740800,,2384,4.142548596112311
7450366,5,B015S4DS1K,"To Miami Nights in response to your post.

 The greatest part of this movie is not only the idea of love and equality, but also the simple idea that change is possible if you embrace it. This movie had me crying, laughing, and angry which is all cause and effect of a great movie. Everyone should see this movie no matter where you come from or who you are. It portrays life the way it really is without holding back. Who enjoys watching a movie when we all know the ending, or what's going to happen next? We love and hate true ending stories because most of them we know that it has to be done, but we can't bear to think that its going to actually be done. We as people naturally want to feel happy but as most of us know all to well tragedy is just as much a part of life as happiness. It is good that at the end of the movie they didn't have Walt do a complete 360 change and start loving all Hmong people, and become this completely self righteous man because in real life things just don't happen like that. Its good they showed how he developed a relationship with them but still kept most of his beliefs. This movie should have won awards regardless of the films first time actors sometimes they care more about how the movie is going then big name actors. It's always good to see a movie with a good message use first time actors it can help us connect better with the characters and it helps them get their names out there and maybe start a career themselves in the movie business. Regardless of the fact this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and it will continue to rain in my heart for years. This is a true to life story and will bring many to emotions to anyone who watches it. The fact that Walt can adapt and develop a relationship with those he despises the most is remarkable. It's ironic how the story's plays out as well. In the beginning Thao tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino which is how there relationship begins and at the end when Walt dies he gives his two things in life he cares about most to Thao his dog daisy and the 1972 Gran Torino. Its almost angelic at the end of the movie when Thao is driving the Gran Torino with daisy down the shore drive, and you hear Walt also known as Clint Eastwood singing the song called ""Gran Torino,"" making his presence known it gave me goose bumps.
 I would like to point out that Asian Americans are just as present today and have their own society, gangs, and even communities around the country. Most of them go unnoticed and some people don't even realize they exist, but they are here and they aren't going anywhere. It's very good that somebody took the time to shine the light on them and to show people that they are here. America is the biggest melting pot of any country and everyone has a right to be here to try and make a better living. Asian Americans are everyday people and deserve to be known as such. The stereotypes given to Asian Americans mainly come from movies that portray them wrongly, and hopefully because of Clint Eastwood more people will try to represent them more accurately. This was by far my favorite Clint Eastwood's best movie and its one of his best movies he has ever not only played a role in but directed as well. We all love Dirty Harry and Million Dollar Baby and the rest of his movies, but as far as the message he was trying to send with this particular movie it has hit home to a lot of people. There are two very important messages in this movie. The first one is love and care for those people in your life because life is too short and will pass you buy, and the second message is work hard and good things will come to you don't take the easy way out.",1349568000,,3700,4.215796897038082

7450392,5,B015S4DS1K,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.

Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The ""Gran Torino"" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.

Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.

Also, I once had a huge fight with my ex, who wanted me to see ""Saving Private Ryan"". His argument: ""War is an important topic and you need to see this movie."" Mine: ""I know it's an important topic, and I don't *need* to see a movie to know it.""

So, having said that, again, not what I expected. Although I am can be tender-hearted, I rarely cry at movies. I did at this one. And I think people *should* see this movie to learn what happens when the war is over.

Clint's character is an old, racist, white man, who, after fighting in Korea, spent his life working for Ford. He has an old Ford truck, and a 1972 Gran Torino, his pride and joy, that incidentally he helped build. His wife has passed on, his kids hate him, he grandchildren only care about what he might leave them, he practically has no friends left, and his neighborhood is now filled with Hmong. Foreigners. Who he hates, wishing they would just leave the neighborhood - or at least keep their yards up.

His neighbors hate him, and wish *he* would leave the neighborhood.

Stalemate, until the young boy next door tries to steal his Gran Torino as his initiation into a gang, and he catches the boy doing it.

I won't go too much into the details, but of course, bad things happen then. Good things as well.  And we learn, in a subtle way, how that war affected him. And his family and children. And his foreign neighbors, and their children. And what ""sacrifice"" means. I highly, highly recommend this movie. It will touch your heart.",1339891200,4,1719,4.434920634920635

The inclusion of humor (however racist and sometimes hurtful) makes this movie well balanced. I was rotflmao at the barber shop scene. The fact that it looked ad-libbed made it more real for me. Another reviewer said Walt hated everybody. That is right ... not so much a biased racist as a hater of everyone ... even the white kid who was trying to emulate the hommies.

I just seen this film for a second time and was moved again by its depth of insight, profound character development, along with Clint's profound interpretation of the character of Walt. This performance was an Oscar caliber rendition in my view.

Eastwood's Directing also brings sensitivity to the characters and the issues they face in a social context of gang violence in the hood.

This film is a humanistic tour de force and only enhances the gruff character portrayal Eastwood delivers as protagonist.

The relationship between Eastwood and Tau is the major theme of the film and it tells a contemporary  story of the mentorship of a wise (if overly gruff) man who leads a young man in to the ways of the world, but additionally, tells us that care and concern for marginalized populations is an act of great courage.

7450422,4,B015S4DS1K,"One of Clint Eastwood's BEST films, and his least politically-correct (PC) film.  I think there's a correlation.  Another film he did (Letters from Iwo Jima) had its impact & quality definitely damaged by trying to be too PC.  In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays Walt, an old curmugeonly Korean War Vet who's about as least PC as any character I've witnessed in the movies.  He is definitely Old School, he is a retired auto worker, he jokes and curses a lot and he calls everybody by ethnic slurs.  He is growing old and he doesn't fit in with today's society any more.  He is estranged from his yuppie Son's family (his Son sells Toyotas and lives in the suburbs, and his Grandaughter is quite spoiled).  He packs an old 45 handgun to keep himself safe, well, because he lives in Detroit.  Walt's neighborhood is changing into Hmong immigrants and although Walt has quite the initial prejudice against them, he slowly starts accepting them after befriending neighbor Thao (a 18-ish Hmong boy, who initially tried to steal Walt's car after being pressured by a gang but then works for Walt to make up for it).  So Walt gradually feels more attached to his Hmong neighbor children than he does to his own family, and he gets pulled into their lives.  A big part of their lives is avoiding Hmong gangs, and Walt ends up being embroiled in their fight with the local gang.

This film works on many levels.  It works on a dramatic level as the viewer identifies with Walt and becomes enmeshed in his life's struggles, as well as Thao's and Thao's sister.  It works on an emotional level as Walt brings out his past demons (from the war) and connects with Thao as if he were his own son.  It also works on a symbolic level, as Walt, the old white American, is slowly going downhill, as he sees his world changing around him, with some good (Asians working hard to rise out of poverty, become doctors etc), some bad (his complacent Son and bratty Granddaughter) and some appalling (Asian, Black and Latino gangs prowling Detroit's mean streets and fomenting violence).  And finally, it works on an acting level, as Eastwood plays a really good cranky old curmugeon!  (BTW Eastwood's son plays a pretty effective bit part as a local white kid trying to act cool in order to escape violence from some local street thugs.)

It's yet another in a line of vigilante movies, but more human and involved than, say, Death Wish, and with a powerful dramatic twist at the end.  Being non-PC, it is very effective and does not pull punches.  But it is artistic as well -- the theme song played at the end, written by Eastwood & performed by Jamie Cullem is haunting and beautiful.

7450424,5,B015S4DS1K,"(spoilers in this review)Gran Torino is a movie about a racist Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood. In movie opens and closes with a funeral. The first one being Walt's wife's, where we learn that the members of his family are spoiled and selfish. Walt is living in the fifties, although his neighborhood is very different from what it was back then. Hmong people have moved in all around him. And being that he is racist he doesn't really like this not only because they are Hmong but also because they can't seem to keep up their yards or houses. One night someone tries to steal his prized Gran Torino that he helped build in the ford factory. Walt comes after them with his other prized possession his rifle. Later he find out it was his neighbor Thao's gang initiation, after spending a considerable amount of time with Thao and his family. By the end of the movie Walt becomes close with Thao, his sister Su and the rest of the family except Grandma. And because of Walt trying to protect them from the Hmong gang the family suffers the repercussions. Thao wants revenge for the gang hurting his family but Walt will not allow this. Walt sacrifices his life in order to give Thao and Su a chance in life. Because with the gang in the neighborhood Walt believed they had no chance.
 I would give this movie five stars, I loved it. I think the movie did a great job in painting Walt's family in a negative way. I know their portrayal made me hate them in the first few minutes, which helped me understand some of the reason why Walt was miserable. I think audiences will appreciate the humor although it's very vulgar, and will be touched by the act of love and selflessness that is Walt's sacrifice for Thao and Su.",1331769600,,1748,4.47962382445141
7450425,3,B015S4DS1K,"Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) ""at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us"".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life.

7450436,5,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is a remarkable film that is difficult to characterize.  Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect ""Walt"".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.

There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?  In my opinion this film may be forgiven that, because in the context of this film it is a legitimate device to bring the viewer to the ultimate message of the film, which is one of mutual respect and ultimately, friendship.

7450438,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino (2008)
Drama, 116 minutes
Directed by Clint Eastwood
Starring Clint Eastwood, Christopher Carley, Bee Vang and Ahney Her

Gran Torino was a total surprise to me when I first viewed it. I had no idea what it might be about and the cover suggested it would be an action movie. With Clint Eastwood being almost 80 years of age at the time, I couldn't see how it would work.

It turns out that it isn't an action movie at all. The main themes include age, the loss of a loved one, racism, friendship, family, religion, and personal growth.

Walt Kowalsky is a Korean war veteran and one of the last white people in a neighborhood mostly populated by Hmong residents. The film opens with his wife's funeral. He's suddenly friendless and alone, but for the unwanted attention of his two sons and their families, who see him as a burden and wonder what he'll leave them when he dies.

The local priest (Carley) promised Walt's wife that he would keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to go to confession. His immediate neighbors annoy him; especially when their boy, Thao (Vang), tries to steal his beloved '72 Gran Torino. To complete Walt's misery, he's coughing up blood and may not have long to live.

That all sounds pretty miserable, doesn't it? Despite the grim situation, Gran Torino has a great deal of (intelligent) humor. Walt doesn't pull his punches: he refers to Asians as Gooks and Blacks as Spooks. He tells the persistent priest that he's an ""over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promise them eternity."" He speaks in grunts and snarls and seems to hate every person he deals with.

Walt is a complex character. His neighbors convince him to accept Thao's apology for trying to steal his car by offering the boy's labor for a week. Thao works hard and earns Walt's respect. The two actually develop a friendship of sorts and Walt also likes Thao's sister, Sue (Her). As unlikely as it may seem, from Walt's perspective, he finds that his neighbors are decent people and takes an interest in their lives. He finds that he has more in common with them than his own family.

I won't give away any more details, but the story shows how people still have the capacity for change, despite advanced age and a lifetime of behaving in a certain way. The humor is frequent, with Eastwood timing his lines perfectly. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this might just be Eastwood's best acting performance. It's certainly my favorite performance from those that I have seen.",1330473600,,2548,4.648888888888889

Throughout his illustrious acting career, Clint Eastwood has delivered a series of iconic characters, such as The Man with no name, Dirty Harry, Josie Wales, and Will Munny in Unforgiven.

Throughout his illustrious directing career he has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award.

The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.

In Gran Torino he both directs and acts, and delivers an acting performance that will be remembered long after the final credits roll, in its unique way, as memorable as any other character he has created.

Gran Torino is the second best movie I have seen this year. Not just for the acting, not just for the directing, but for the storytelling, and the emotional journey on which it takes you, the laughter, the feeling of being gripped, and its more surprising moments.

In the opening scenes, we have the exposition of the character. We get to know Walt Kowalski, by how people act around him, and his seemingly hateful attitude towards people. More is conveyed through a scowl, and a snarl than with words. When the mischievous grandchildren go through his stuff in the basement, we see the Silver Star he won in Korea. There are three other important symbols in the movie, the lighter, the gun, and the car.

We see a hero with a warrior past, a patriot who fought for a cause greater than himself. Clearly, his bigotry stems from those experiences.

He's not just mean, he's 'get of my lawn' mean. He's Dirty Harry 'Go ahead punk, make my day!,' mean.

His dead wife's priest bugs him to hear his confession, at her request. The priest in a way is his wife's conscience.

When he snarls down the barrel of his rifle, at the neighborhood punk: 'I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,' you get the sense that he means it.

So, with all that happens, we see the change in his decision making, from someone reluctant to be involved in his neighbor's affairs, and a story can turn on something as random as looking at an empty beer cooler.

For all his faults, Walt has mature masculine character. Even though he is a difficult father, he has taught his children character. So, when he sees the boy next door lacks character, and a strong male role model, he takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to be a man.

The scenes where the boy practises Walt's high octane ball busting banter, are the funniest in the movie. Through knowing Walt, he makes decisions he never would have made by himself. In so doing, Walt finds meaning and purpose, and a chance for redemption, and the boy becomes a man.

The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:

1. Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.

2. Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.

Every rule has an exception. Russell Crowe in Gladiator played a character with thematic similarities to Walt.

For a 78 year old man to direct and be lead actor in a movie of this caliber is an achievement worthy at the very least of being nominated for the highest award for Acting, Directing or both.

7450462,5,B015S4DS1K,"This film resonated with me for several reasons.  First, because
I am a 3rd Generation Japanese-American and visibly recognizable as
an 'Asian', with the resultant consequences in American society.
Secondly, because the film was shot in the greater Detroit area and
I was born and raised in Detroit.  Finally, because I have been BOTH characters shown in the film.  I was the clueless, withdrawn and shy Asian teenager and
after retiring from the Detroit PD after 25 years of street patrol service, I
have become the grumpy, conservative old man.
I see some of the reviewers who gave the film only 1 or 2 stars, have missed the point of the film completely and for entirely opposite reasons. I saw the words, 'depressing, 'dark', and 'sad' used by some of those reviewers.
Welcome to the life of an Asian in America.
The young Asian guy in the film may have appeared 'wooden' but he was a fairly accurate depiction of what I was like at that age.  And no, I was never gang-raped by any group of racist cowards. The racial antipathy of some of the negative reviewers towards Asians, is pretty transparent to me.
Some people will never confront nor admit their own level of racism toward all Asian people.  Hollywood has contributed greatly to decades of depicting us as the traditional enemy of White civilization.  So it is good that a Hollywood film has done something significant to counter-balance that propaganda.  The film 'Letters From Iwo Jima' was another contribution Mr. Eastwood has made toward better understanding of the other guy's point of view.  Perhaps Mr. Eastwood's marriage to a woman with a percentage of Japanese ancestry has made him more acutely aware of the insane degree of racist antipathy toward all Asians, which is held by millions of folks in this great country?  When I recommended viewing of 'Letters' to some of my friends, who are WWII buffs, to my surprise, they refused to even watch the film, because anti Japanese sentiment is still so pervasive, that they have no interest in even considering the perspective of these former enemies.  Discovering that about my 'friends' was an eye-opener for me.
Now I want to close this review by stating the 'real' reason why Gran Torino was snubbed at the Oscars.  It had nothing to do with the racial slurs made against Asians.  It was in fact because there were no black characters in the film with any socially-redeeming qualities and the only ones shown were despicable street gang members, who were addressed by Waly Kowalski with racist slurs comparable to those he used when addressing the Asians in the film.  Here's where the big double-standard comes in.  It is acceptable to laugh about the Gook, slant, slope, Dragon-lady insults, but the Academy wouldn't DARE endorse any film which contains any anti-black language or messages. That is sacrosanct, Holy ground, upon which no public media is allowed to tread.
There are minorities in the USA and then there are Untouchable Minorities.

7450488,1,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is an emotionally satisfying, cathartic revenge movie of the Clint Eastwood genre. Clint stands up for the little guy against a bunch of bullies, the bullies retaliate brutally against Clint's weaker friend (Unforgiven?), after which Clint goes on the warpath and gives the bad guys their come-comeuppance. This type of movie is no less powerful for being predictable. Gran Torino is different in a couple of ways though. Firstly, in its characters and its setting, it has more texture than most movies of its type. Clint is the last White man in his once clean and safe Detroit neighborhood, now dominated by Hmong and blacks and is having a hard time dealing with the transformation. This is a situation that I don't recall being depicted by Hollywood before, and it is portrayed with great realism and grit. Secondly, this movie is different in that Clint's ultimate vengeance doesn't involve massacring all the bad guys, but in setting up his own murder so that the thugs are all arrested. So what's the problem with this movie?

Clint's character is the victim of a historic injustice. In a neighborhood, a city and a country that he and his people built, he is now a stranger, living in a sea of criminals and parasitic foreigners imported into America by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 Immigration Act. The Democratic Party, with the cowardly complicity of the Republican Party and the ideological support of media and academia, have flooded America with non-White immigrants, to the point where Whites will be a minority in the U.S. by 2030. We didn't invite in foreigners based on their skill sets or personal character. So long as they were not White, it was ok with the Left so long as the hordes  undermined the dominance of Americans in their own country. The revolutionary and historical implications of this are obvious. No nation in history has ever voluntarily committed suicide. No nation in history has ever chosen to be conquered. Indeed, Americans never voted to give away our country to others, but that's still what's happening. We know what the Left called it when 19th century White men moved into African or Asian countries and took over the government. They call it colonialism, aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide. When it's happening to 21st century White people in America and Europe, the Left calls it ""diversity"" and ""multiculturalism"". The implicit, and explicit, message of our Marxist masters is that White people need to die. Our continued existence is a bitter reminder of what America used to be: White, proud and strong. Therefore, we need to give away our neighborhoods, our cities, our country and our classic cars to our black, brown and yellow superiors and just die, while rejoicing in our destruction.

It bears noting that this movie was written by a man named Schenk and produced by men named Gerber and Lorenz, along with Eastwood. Somehow, I think we'll be waiting in vain for a movie advocating the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees, extolling the glorious diversity that they would bring to Israel.",1315612800,23,3066,4.961089494163424
7450489,5,B015S4DS1K,"I watched this movie on television this weekend and was moved to tears.

Many people in this country (this world) beleive that bigotry and hatred are justified and justifiable. But never can a person be more deluded, unless people argue such bigotry and hatred as being a product of Godliness. Egads.

Bigotry never stems from hatred toward others for their differences, bigotry and hatred eminates from individuals sense of self-loathing and inadequacy.

Walt is an angry, hatred filled man whose attitudes helped shape and were further validated by, his dysfunctional dissonance toward life and living. Not being provided much context prior to his military service, one can only assume personality and behavior across the lifespan. However, Walt's military service alone is shown to be enough to cause great self-assuredness and egocentrism, while also creating the perpetuated myopic and callous racist and sexist views. The stern disciplinary behavior of a soldier is the fortitude and even arrogance presented by Walt, while the eternal burden of guilt of killing others create a complex, sympathetic character of an angry old man confronted by the meanings of life.

His relationship with his own children is strained. Who is to blame is left to presumption, however considering his children's shallow, biggoted (elderly are feable people to take from and diminish through patronization) and estrangement, it is obvious within the film that they are far less sympathetic than the targets of Walt's venom and vitriole.

Walt's strongest display of true confidence is when he locks away the vulnerable Thoa in his basement and avers that the greatest suffering that Thoa could ever experience would be that of killing another human being. Walt recognized that the enemey soldiers that he killed in battle were nothing more or less than he, frightened soldiers doing what they were ordered to do. They were human beings.

More so, Walt's bigotry is confronted head on when he steps into a social ill beleiving that he is only protecting his own self interests (his property from the disturbance of tussling neighbors and idiotic gang members.) From his single act of selfish heroism, Walt is subjected to all of the trappings of a vastly disparate culture, one which is based less in individuality and more in social structure, respect for culture and all of the cultures vulnerabilities.

With the help of a brazenly self-confident and enlightened young lady, Walt learns that life is not as it seems and that human beings (as opposed to cretins) are more complex and decent when viewed from various perspectives. What Walt previously interpreted as weakness and untrustworthiness, is in fact respectfulness and honor toward family. When that respect and honor is presented to Walt, he quickly recognizes some strengths within (such as good food) and opens his doors slightly to accept some of the fruits of the diverse culture. This is furthered by the opportunistic young lady who further educates Walt and (with the indentured help from the confused Thoa), shows that in truth, Walt ""has more in common"" with the odd characters that he has long loathed, than he has with his ""own family.""

Thus, Walt not only begrudgingly changes his views, but his behaviors and ultimately sacrifices his own life in his one grand effort to make amends for all that has long tortured his soul... and to give life to someone else who is at the crossroads between good and evil (being pulled hardest from the dark side.)

Ultimately, Walt shows that love is for the world entire... and that we are all far more alike than we are different. If we all could open our eyes and our hearts, push aside our fears and angers... we just might be able to defeat the hatred and corruption and live in peace for one another, instead of for ourselves (our fears and angers.)

Thank you Clint Eastwood, for giving us GRAN TORINO. I wish I had put aside my own bigotry (toward your tough guy, vengeance seeking, immature machismo filled action films) and allowed myself to watch this movie long ago.",1315267200,,4075,5.014792899408284

Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right.

The picture is tolerable because I, like most movie-goers, am used to Clint's being Dirty Harry and making his points efficiently and with a minimum of subtlety.  Of course, the rest of the characters are equally cliched.  I will say that Clint's films seems more graceful at it than Charles Bronson's.  The climactic scene is a bit of a surprise, but I wonder what would have happened had the bad guys waited for Clint to fire the first shot.  I guess the message in all this is that we need to figure out how to accept the incursion of other cultures into our blue-collar neighborhoods.",1311206400,,837,4.777777777777778
7450496,5,B015S4DS1K,"Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.

Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful.

7450498,5,B015S4DS1K,"I saw Clint tell an interviewer that he believed this movie will be his last acting job, that there are no more interesting parts for him to play at his advanced age. Debatable, but nonetheless GRAN TORINO will be remembered as among Clint's greatest films. It has a wealth of strengths to recommend it:

*There is the interesting plot dealing with the two primary characters. Kowalski, the gun-toting, bigoted, foul-tempered, codger
  neighbor softens some while the weak teen-aged Asian boy next door hardens some. The development of their relationship is
  wonderful.
*The displays of the Asian neighbors' ways are fascinating.
*For fans of Clint's toughness displays there's that, too. In fact Clint is still quite believable at age 78 sticking guns into
  villain's faces and stomping people into the ground!
*The film contains racism, but don't let that keep you from seeing it. The racism is presented tastefully to define the main character.
*I challenge anyone to get through the ending without shedding tears: it's that touching and sad.

GRAN TORINO is very impressive, especially when you consider that many of the cast's younger members weren't even actors! Clint also directed this one, and again he earned his regard as one of Hollywood's best directors. With a small budget he put together a hell of a movie that covers relationships, racism, gang crime, comedy, excitement, and death.",1308960000,3,1401,5.140969162995595
7450499,5,B015S4DS1K,"This drama, starring Clint Eastwood, and directed, produced, and partially written by him, is properly advertised as ""the performance of a lifetime."" It is undoubtedly one of the best films. The story is about an elderly man, an award winning veteran of the Korean War, an atheist, who has never been found contentment in life, whose wife just died, and who, knowing her husband's problems, asks a young parish priest to look after him. He lives in a neighborhood that has changed, surrounded by Orientals who he calls gooks, whom he doesn't understand and dislikes intensely. He is very possessive of what he has and wants to be left alone. He becomes involved with his neighbors when they are attacked by a gang. Everything about the film is great, the story, plot development, acting, pacing, suspense, scenery.

 Viewers can be stimulated to ask lots of questions about the many issues raised in the film. These include: the problems of growing old, death of a spouse, illness among the aged, getting along with children, grandchildren, and neighbors, handling neighborhood gangs, prejudice, bad and belittling language, finding meaning in life, the existence of life after death, the impact of wars and killing, revenge, are clergy equipped to address problems they never faced. Most significantly is the issue of change: can an irascible discontented elderly man, who has no ability to interact with his own family, find meaning and love from strangers?",1307059200,3,1459,5.100418410041841

I would not recommend it and would not watch it again. My family member watched the whole movie, but I walked out because of the violence and offensive language. The reason I say that it was interesting is because my relatives verbally told me how the story developed after I walked out and also how it ended.

7450505,5,B015S4DS1K,"GRAN TORINO was directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood and it stars Mr. Eastwood. The story was by Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk.  The movie lives and breathes humanity. The movie is almost like a melange of CRASH (2004) starring Matt Dillon, ALL IN THE FAMILY (1971-1979) starring Caroll O'Conner, and MEN OF HONOR (2000) starring Cuba Gooding. On one or two occasions, GRAN TORINO shows the grittiness of THE PAWNBROKER starring Rod Steiger.  Throughout the film, there are near-continual undercurrents of tension, where one might expect an outburst of some sort to occur.  There are no weak periods in this film.  There is no filler in this film.

Here are a few comments:

(A)  MEDIATING BETWEEN TWO CULTURES.  Ahney Her, who plays Mr. Eastwood's neighbor, will steal your heart.  She serves as a go-between, mediating communication between the traditional American culture and the traditional Hmong culture.  She is fluent in the Hmong language, and fluent in English, and she has no trace of accent when she speaks English.  The film becomes ever the more powerful, towards the end, when she become a tragic figure.  The Hmong language actually consists of a group of dialects, spoken by Hmong people of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.

(B)  WHAT MATTERS MOST IN LIFE.  The film identifies what is the meaning of life.  For some people, the essence of the meaning of life is to discover the cure for cancer.  This goal is reachable by only a select few, such as Prof. D.Slamon, the inventor of trastuzumab.  But for others, such as the character played by Mr. Eastwood, meaning of life comes from teaching somebody self-respect, and teaching somebody a new skill.  Perhaps, that is what GRAN TORINO is all about.

(C)  SELF-SACRIFICE.  Regarding the ending of the film, this film takes exactly the same approach as that taken in Mr. Eastwood's other movie, SPACE COWBOYS.  The approach is this.  A man who knows he is terminally ill sacrifices himself to do a good deed.  This approach is emphasized by a crack in the sidewalk, in a scene at the end of GRAN TORINO.  The use of this symbolic crack is a work of pure genius. (I'm not telling you what it is. There is no need for a ""spoiler alert"" at this point.)

(D) CIGARETTE LIGHTER.  This is about the cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  GRAN TORINO has the recurring theme of a cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  This exact theme occurs in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  In STRANGER ON A TRAIN, the lighter has a picture of golf clubs, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist.  In GRAN TORINO, the lighter had a symbol of a U.S. military group from the Korean war, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist. My understanding is that STRANGER ON A TRAIN is frequently used as a teaching device in film school.  Hence, the use of this particular theme in GRAN TORINO cannot be said to be a coincidence.  There is nothing wrong with recycling themes.  In fact, when themes are recycled, this enables contemporary cinematographers to stand on the shoulders of earlier cinematographic giants (to paraphrase Isaac Newton).

(E) CATHOLICISM.  GRAN TORINO is a fine educational device for those interested in knowing what is Catholicism.  For those totally naive in matters relating to Christianity, and to Catholicism in particular, this movie seems to provide a practical, fair-minded, and favorable accounting of this religion.  In contrast, it is the case that many other Hollywood productions characterize Catholicism as a cult that is obsessed with witch hunting and exorcism, or as a religion for simpletons (as in, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, starring Helen Hunt as the Catholic).

(F)  STAR WARS CANTINA SCENE.  GRAN TORINO never lets up with its continual entourage of clever scenes.  When Mr. Eastwood eventually goes to the clinic, he finds himself in a waiting room filled with foreigners.  There is an Indian woman.  There is an East Asian man.  The receptionist is Ethiopian Moslem woman.  When the receptionist calls out, ""Mister Kowalski,"" her accent is so strong, one can almost feel Mr. Eastwood cringing because of how poorly his name is being pronounced.  By the time this scene arrives, the viewer of GRAN TORINO is already aware that the qualities of Mr. Eastwood's neighborhood that were known to him, from the happy years 1950 to 1980, have simply disintegrated into nothingness.  To avoid dropping into the hole of existential nothingness, Mr. Eastwood clings to the few remaining things that he can, almost obsessively so.  These include Mr. Eastwood's unending parade of Pabst beer, his Italian barber friend, and the rituals of mowing his lawn and polishing his GRAN TORINO.  Anyway, the scene at the waiting room in the doctor's office, with its bizarre melange of different nationalities, reminded me of the STAR WARS cantina scene in located in the city of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine.

(G)  NAMES.  Naming is a concept normally studied by Ph. D. students in philosphy, psychology, and literature.  Thousands of college professors have carved out their career by studying the symbolism of names, that is, names of characters in books and plays.  This particular movie contains the interesting theme of names.  Towards the beginning of GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood complains when the priest calls him ""Walt,"" and demands that he be called, ""Mr. Kowalski.""  Eventually, Mr. Eastwood softens, and reluctantly allows the priest to call him, ""Walt.""  At about the same time, Ahney Her, the charming Hmong teenager, calls him, ""Wally.""  Mr. Eastwood raises a protest, but it is modest, and he finds himself feeling comfortable when Ahney Her calls him, ""Wally.""  An explanation is at hand.  What does the priest have to offer Mr. Eastwood?  Nothing.  And what does Ahney Her have to offer Mr. Eastwood?  Plenty -- her family provides him with tasks that provide meaning to his life, including, making humble household repairs, teaching Ahney's brother how to talk like a confident man, teaching Ahney's brother a trade (carpentry), and protecting Ahney from neighborhood gangs.  Then, towards the end of the movie, the issue of names comes up again in the clinic, where the Ethiopian reception mangles Mr. Eastwood's name to the point where it is almost unrecognizable.  She calls, ""Mister Kwaaski?  Mister Kwaaski?""

(H)  AIRHEAD.  This is about actor Dreama Walker.  Ms. Dreama Walker is a professional actor who has been in dozens of films.  She plays the airhead.  Her character is simultaneously charming and nauseating.  Dreama Walker's character fits squarely in the tradition established by Alicia Silverstone in CLUELESS and by Moon Unit Zappa in her song, VALLEY GIRL.  The airhead seems to be a new literary invention, as I am not sure if any character of this type has ever appeared, for example, in the works of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Moliere, or Shakespeare.

No review can do justice to the intelligence, insight, humor, and humanity, that is found in GRAN TORINO.  While this film certainly does not provide insight regarding EVERY aspect of the human condition, it does provide a compelling narrative regarding relations between young versus old, American versus foreign, naive versus savvy, and so on.  As a comment on the ""human condition,"" I find this film is as remarkable as any piece of literature coming from the pen of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, or Melville.  But a difference between GRAN TORINO and the works of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, and Melville, is that you do not need a Ph. D. in literature to understand GRAN TORINO.  Five trillion stars for this one.",1304035200,2,7639,4.984956452889945

Lets face it, he's no spring chicken and considered by some a little crusty around the edges, but this guy has endured the gift of time. Gran Torino is an excellent movie on many different levels. I am drawn to the movie because my family used to own a gran torino when I started driving. I really loved that car. I am also impressed with the fact that this movie is not ""Politically Correct""; of coures I am talking about that term of endearment used in the movie: ""Zipperhead"". Political Correctness is killing this country. No one in this country can have an opinion or say anything without hurting someones elses feelings. Get a grip people!  This is America where one has freedom of speech.  The founding fathers said nothing about ""PC"", expressed or implied. I am further drawn to this movie bcause I am a veteran and proudly served this great country. I still remember the oath I took on induction day and how powerful those words were, especially the part about supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States. None the less, if you are one who enjoys well written/performed movie entertainment,blended with today's harsh realities including racial overtones, gang violence, and peer pressure interwoven with a comical yet meaningful bond between an old, slowly dying war veteran and his Southeast Asian neighbors next door, then you will enjoy this movie.

7450520,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood portrays Walt, an average everyday retired auto worker & a veteran of the Korean war.  He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!

At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!

Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.

This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Forrester/dp/B00005ASOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Forrester</a>.

They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.

One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.

I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, ""shaken, not stirred"" & ""I'll be back.""  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.

So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.  For myself, this is my very favorite CE movie.  If you're not a big fan of his style, this DVD just might compel you to change your mind about the big fella!",1301356800,,2729,5.092342342342342

7450522,5,B015S4DS1K,"I've been a long time fan of Eastwood's and I can honestly say that this is amongst my favorites. It is certainly much more satisfying than ""Million Dollar Baby"" at least in my book and definitely above ""Bloodwork"". It's not ""Unforgiven"" or ""Dirty Harry"". All of those to varying degrees were escapist fodder. Escaping into the old west or the streets of San Francisco can be pleasurable. ""Gran Torino"" has moments that harkens back to William Money or Harry Callahan but only moments. Those are probably the moments seen in the previews. This movie surprised me with its combination of drama and humor and compassion in dealing with sensitive subjects like aging, death, racism, religion and a re-evaluation of a person's values; to come to peace with inner demons that have tormented someone and finding peace within one's self. The characters flawed enough so that there is no preachy message here or anything and doesn't pretend to be some sensitive film about any of it's subject, but instead deals with them rather harshly actually.
There is plenty of humor to be found herein as Walt Kowalski, Polish-American veteran of the Korean War, retired auto plant worker and now a widower faces the change of having to deal with things changing in his life. Kowalski never misses a chance to get in a racial slur and even as his son drives away after the wife's funeral, Kowalski noticing the make of the son's vehicle mutters,"" Why can't you buy American?"" and inside the vehicle the son Mitch's comments are about the predictability of dad's racist outlook on things. And speaking of racism there is a heavy dose of this elsewhere as well.
Walt's neighbors are Hmong people whose son is harassed by a group of thugs wanting to initiate him into their gang so as to protect him from a rival Mexican gang. Thao Vang Lor is assigned the task of stealing Kowalski's prize possession from his days at the Ford plant, a mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino. Thao botches his assignment and the gang show up to give Thao a second chance. When he refuses that gang becomes violent and Kowalski is awakened by the shouts and the sounds of yard ornaments being knocked over and broken. Walt armed with his shotgun isn't afraid of the gang or their ""f"" word vocabulary. The gang backs off and retreats and Walt becomes an unwilling hero to the Hmong's whether he likes it or not. Only Thao and his sister, Su speak any English so Walt is unable to communicate to the other relatives that he just wanted to left alone. After being smothered with flowers and trays of Hmong delicacies, Thao's mother, Vu forces Thao to confess to Walt about his attempted car theft. Su, translating for Vu explains that Thao must atone for his deed by working for Walt. Walt reluctantly becomes sort of father figure to Thao even getting him a job in construction and loaning him tools, but Thao's cousin from the street gang and friends have other ideas and brutally beat Thao one day while heading home from work. Su also is rescued from some black thugs by Walt and expresses her gratitude by making Walt a regular dinner guest. Meanwhile, Walt goes after one of the gang the beat up Thao and leaves him beaten and bruised with a warning to leave Thao alone. The gang retaliates, opening fire on the front of the Vang Lor's house with automatic weapons, and beating and raping Su.
The end has Walt finally coming to terms with his racism and other demons. Thao assumes that Walt will go after the gang for what they did to Su and that he will be along for the ride. Walt forbids this and locks him in the basement. The end is a fatal shoot out with Walt as the victim and the gang is placed under arrest.
The gist of this is that Walt has never told anyone that he was dying of tuberculosis. He is seen visiting a clinic and coughing up blood on several occasions. He dies for a cause and settles his demons regarding the things he did in the war which have haunted him all of his life and are the underlying reason for his bitterness. He resents being a hero for things he didn't want to do in the first place. This may seem a bit contrived but it flows well and ties up all of the loose ends nice and neatly and even gives you some things to think about as well.
This isn't the greatest movie that Eastwood has ever done. But it may serve as the final chapter in all of those ""aged"" character movies that he's been putting out since ""Unforgiven. The aging gunfighter(Unforgiven), aging thief (Absolute Power), aging news reporter (True Crime), aging secret service agent (In The Line of Fire) and so forth. This seems to be sort of the culmination and final chapter of that series of movies the same common thread. This, however, does deserve a place amongst Eastwood's best and most original movies.",1299024000,,4776,4.580607476635514

7450547,5,B015S4DS1K,"`Gran Torino' is quite simply one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. Directed by, produced by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film has a feeling of gravitas and meaning from the word go. This follows Walt Kowalski, who is a Korean war veteran, and how has he seen the neighbourhood around him change over the years and how he has seen a rise in violence and intimidation. It also looks at how he faces his own prejudices about his Hmong neighbours and strikes a relationship with the family next door. It is touching to see Walt develop from the archetype grumpy old man, to seeing someone with a softer side and with a great deal of compassion for those who are in a worse situation than himself. Clint plays Walt gruff and old school from the outset and you often laugh at his up front honesty, especially when confronted with a do-good catholic priest, but he isn't a one trick pony and manages to show his considerable acting (and directing) skills throughout. This may be Clint's swansong film, but considering the calibre of films he is making at the moment it would be a great shame if that was so. This has a powerful ending that will resonate long after the credits have rolled and will have you coming back to it in your mind at odd times in the days after you watch the film. This may be a scathing indictment of modern life in some cities, but it also has a well written storyline with impact and power. Needless to say, I highly recommend it.

The acting is terrific.  The fierce Hmong grandmother (Chee Thao) who traded steely glares with Clint Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski); the selfish relatives; Walt's friends - everyone is wonderful.  Not a false note amoung them.
This film also serves to educate viewers about the role the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war and the consequences they endured.  Something I was ignorant of but am glad to be aware of now.

7450571,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino opens with Clint blankly staring at his family during his wife's wake at church. The viewer can see his disgust and pain fighting for control of his emotions. Here is a man, a proud traditionalist witnessing his world disappear before his very eyes, and worst of all he sees this transformation in his own family. He seems to ask the audience if they understand what's happened.
Clint's character has spent his life fighting for the American ideals and purity. He has little patience for apologists (the young priest) or his greedy and distant blood family. He finds himself in the middle of a transformation that has left little of his former world intact, as he realizes that the new world around him is completely foreign,(no pun intended) not only physically but emotionally. He shows us both sides of the coin in our interactions and in our motives. The relentless putsch of nature and natural selection are also evident here as we are reminded by both clashing cultures that ""we must stick to our own"";happily this notion is allowed to run its course and form the abject and pitiable element of their relationships.
This movie forces each one of us to look ourselves in the mirror and see the prejudice, fear and disgust bred by ignorance and adherence to traditional rules. It also allow us to find the most important aspect of our role as human beings in our environment as we are confronted with the dilemma of sticking to our own traditions or doing what is morally right. Between our true self and our everyday persona, we can choose what is more important, our lives as we have lived them (attached to our environments and backgrounds)or the primordial moral high road as Clint showed us in this performance.
After all, this movie highlights the unmovable truth that within us all there is a very high principle and admiration for the rights of men,albeit for some in our species, the necessary precursor to bringing that justice to the forefront may be arduous at best.
Clint, after all seems to answer Rodney King's question with a resounding yes. We can get along, and yes we can find family in the faces of strangers when a halo of mendacity obscures our own blood kindred.",1291075200,2,2201,4.749347258485639
7450572,5,B015S4DS1K,"what people need to realize about this film is that the racism is merely superficial. The barbershop scene, and construction site scene are prime examples. Using epithets, but behaving in a very decent manner, is a hallmark of this movie. I was profoundly moved and impressed how Clint Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski (what a cliched last name however, i.e. Streetcar Named Desire), in effect, becomes a father figure to the two neighbor kids, Thao and Sue, who see through his ""racist talk"", and understand the good man he is .... while his own sons do not, are shallow, materialistic and see him as ""only"" racist ...

for those who think the ending was a disappointment, let me say this ... what would any loving father do for his children, if he had to sacrifice his life to save theirs? I know if I were in ""Walt's"" shoes, I would have done the same. It was a brilliant ending, NOT at all disappointing.

and ... the wrap-up (denouncement, if you will) i.e. funeral and will reading were brilliant, appropriate, and will make you smile ... maybe even shed a tear too ...

7450574,5,B015S4DS1K,"In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, the characters demonstrate cultural boundaries and tension, as well as racism. It
also explores the ideas of sacrifice, atonement for sins, and the meaning of life and death, specifically in Walt's character. The film begins by presenting these themes which develop through the plot. Ironically Walt, who continually mumbles racial slurs, transforms due to his growing relationship with his Hmong neighbors. He begins to differentiate between people who have either good or bad intentions, rather than by culture and race.  After the death of Walt's wife, he becomes increasingly distant from his uncaring family. However, he forms a new family with his neighbors despite the negative events surrounding their first encounters with each other. Although the film both begins and concludes with death, there is a focus on the preservation of life during the film. There is even life as a result of the tragic ending. Walt made the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect Thoa and his family from the violent gang. Through this sacrifice he was also able to atone for his sins from his actions during the
Korean War. Each character was given what they deserved by the end of the movie.

This film effectively portrays the themes while keeping the interest of the viewer. Besides Sue's character, the
acting was exceptional. Like the film, the acting was believable and powerful. The film provided insight on the

When he young boy next door gets out of hand Walt is pressured into having Thao work for him. After a couple of days Walt gets attached to Thao and his sister. Towards the end Walt makes an extreme decision in honor of the Hmong immigrant family next door.

He seems heartless in his bigotry and downright mean in his sarcastic and cynical interactions with others, not only his neighbors, but the young local priest. Even any signs of affection, he might show, come off as crude and vulgar. Don't however, let that sway you.

It's a great movie. I put it up there with his best.

As usual, he helps the underdog, fights against injustice, does the heroic, and becomes the winner--but this time he does it in a different way. All the ""crap"" he spews is just a smokescreen for the love this character can really issue forth. He winds up doing it in a big way. He lives out the Two Great Commandments: ""No greater love ...!"" I do not want to spoil the ending in any way. That has to do with the car too!

My suggestion: don't let the language and the slurs deter you. They are all part of what makes this real. A real alcoholic oozing with venom for a variety of life issues that feed the disease could not do better.

7450595,3,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood is a powerful presence in this film, as Walt Kowalsky, an elderly Korean war veteran trapped in his hyper-masculine, racist, emotionally bared down persona. He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.

The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).

As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.

7450621,1,B015S4DS1K,"Betty, I know you are going to hate me for this, but I have to be honest here.  This movie was just horrible.  It's hard for me to put into eloquent words all of the missteps this poor little film made, because part of me just feels like rambling off a list of bad decisions.

First, I'll lay out the plot.

Walt is a bitter and grumpy old man who is an unapologetic racist dwelling in a community overrun by those with which he has hatred for.  His family has all but written him off, and this visibly irks Walt.  When his neighbor, young Thao, attempts to steal his Gran Torino (as part of a gang initiation), Walt finds himself in a situation (with individuals) he never foresaw.  After inadvertently saving Thao from the clutches of his cousin's gang, Walt is further introduced to Thao's family, and despite being hesitant he begins to warm to Thao after he officially apologizes.  Walt then has Thao become his `handyman', putting him to work around the house doing odd jobs here and there.  Things seem to go well for the two, and a bond is formed, but if we know anything about gangs we know that this will not be the end of things.

The story felt VERY clich&eacute;d and it didn't really try to compensate for those obvious generalizations.  Some make remarks like ""this is far better than `Crash'"" but in the end they are both rather embarrassing reflections of racism to be quite honest.  I'd like you to explain to me HOW this is better than `Crash'.  I won't say it is worse (although I gave `Crash' a C, my feelings for that film have dropped considerably), but it is hardly better.

So let's take this apart, shall we.

I'll start with the script.  Like I said, there are clich&eacute;s that pretty much mount one on top of the other here, from the formulaic way in which Thao's family is represented to the ridiculously generic way that Walt is presented to us.  There is nothing genuine about his character.  Everything feels pulled from another performance or character developed in an Eastwood movie.  This is Eastwood playing Eastwood.  He is grumpy, and everyone knows it, and his family has distanced themselves from him (who can blame them) and yet we are supposed to feel an urge of sympathy for him because he overcomes his racism and befriends Thao and his family?  I found the scene in the barbershop with Thao to be rather ridiculous too.  Yes, this is the type of guy that Walt is, but it's nothing to feel all chummy about.  The way the film ended I thought was (somewhat) clever, and then it went all Hallmark sentiment with the final frame, which I found a tad squeamish.

How about the direction, since that is what Eastwood is all about?  Honestly, this film lacks tremendously in that regard.  Now, for all of you out there (yes, you MKIA) who think that I am an Eastwood hater and that I'm blowing this out of proportion, realize that I gave `Million Dollar Baby' an A+ and still highly regard that film (and it's direction), not to mention an A for `Unforgiven', and despite not caring for it collectively, I gave pretty high marks to `Changeling' as well.  This film though, is just poorly constructed and realized.  The direction is very stagy.  Look at the scene when the family is worried about Sue and she comes in the door, and Walt drops his drink.  Watch how the camera zooms into a closeup of the drink, telling us that Walt is going to drop it before he does and then, what does Walt do...he lets go.  It's not a `disoriented slip through his fingers' drop, it's an `open my hand and make a statement' drop.  It just feels fake.  Decisions like that one give this film an air of unnaturalness that ruins any connective tissue.

But, the acting takes the cake here.  Casting `non-actors' is kind of a vanity thing for a director, but in the end there are moments where it works.  This is not one of them.  Bee Vang has to carry about as much of this film as Eastwood (we'll get to him in a minute) and so he needed to be more authenticated.  I love how one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, ""there is no substitute for authenticity.""  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.  He's obviously trying too hard.  Eastwood, like I mentioned earlier, is just playing himself.  Yes, the script is at fault for handing him a caricature (I don't care what you say about his character arc, it just boils down to a mess of generalities) but Eastwood doesn't put any real life into it.

Snarling and growling and looking all mean and stuff is not really emoting, like at all.

In the end, this overcooked film is just a mess.  I'm sorry Betty, I know you love your Clint (and I won't hold that against you if you don't hold this review against me) but this film is just plain bad.  Maybe the whole racism subject should just be left alone, since no one can really seem to get it right (is it just me or was this another one of those `white guy saves the day' kind of message films), but then again it is a potent subject that has potential to really create something poignant.

This is not poignant.",1280880000,19,5094,4.469122426868906
7450622,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, not Dirty Harry even though the promo for the theatrical release makes you think it's going to be a guns-blazing Dirty Harry encore. His role is more like the tough gunny from Heartbreak Ridge who is now a senior citizen.

Okay, guns and fisticuffs are involved, but the film is so much more than that. Joining Mr. Eastwood in the film is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, a determined priest who knows little of real life as lived by Korean war vet Kowalski; Ahney Her, entrancing as Sue Lor, the spirited Hmong girl next door who just won't let Kowalski continue living isolated and alone; and Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor, called Toad by Kowalski who becomes his surrogate father and role model, teaching the young Hmong how American blue collar guys bond and behave.

As the film opens, Kowalksi is in church for the funeral of his wife, a woman he characterizes later as the best woman in the country that he managed to catch. You won't catch Kowalksi moving into assisted living though his stereotypical sons would love to sell the family home in the old neighborhood and put him where they could justifiably say, ""He's being taken care of."" He's an embarrassment and an emotional anvil around their necks just as they are a puzzle to him.

The trouble with the old neighborhood isn't that it's been taken over by Asians, but that the gangs - Asian, black, Hispanic - have a stranglehold on the decent people who are trying to find their piece of the American dream while still clinging to their traditions and values.

Gran Torino isn't so much about knocking heads, defending the old neighborhood, and facing down gangbangers as it is about character growth and discovering that family doesn't necessarily mean the people you're related to by blood. Eastwood gives a layered performance that is worthy of Best Actor. In fact, there are several stellar performances in this film i.e. Carley's priest and unknown actors Ahney Her and Thao Vang Lor. Even Clint's son Scott Eastwood, credited in the film as Scott Reeves, is good in his role as the gutless Trey.

The ending is surprising. And poignant. If you're an Eastwood fan, you'll love the film. If you abhor Eastwood, you'll be surprised how this film stays with you. I'm just surprised Eastwood didn't sweep all the major film awards. Awards don't make a film a classic. Make no mistake, Gran Torino will become a classic.",1280707200,3,2420,4.752380952380952

A talented director sometimes starring in his own films(e.g. The Outlaw Josey Wales,Unforgiven).In the tradition of stars who project pure Americanism and rectify wrongs(Wayne,Cooper).Eastwood shows a willingness to examine his own screen persona(here comically,witness the macho talking scene in the hairdressers).He shows a willingness to engage with contemporary issues,the immigration into formerly all white areas of Hmong Asians,the kind of people he might have fought in the Korean war. He has a warrior ethic and is outwardly bigoted and not religious. However his family are only after his money and they are trying to get him into an old people's home and get his house and car.

His real family become his next door neighbours who worship his courage and role-modelling abilities for theirson. Ever since The Outlaw Josey Wales, Eastwood has shown a propensity for empathy with marginalised people and outsiders. In this film we get echoes of Dirty Harry, Pale Rider and Unforgiven,but of a humanised kind without the fascist overtones. At the age of 78 to act,write and direct a major film is heroic. He suggests a mixing of global and local themes and shows how to wind the audience in with the unfolding of character. This film provides a great laugh but Walt has to make a great sacrifice.

7450653,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood pulls double duty as director and actor here, starring as Walt Kowalski, a mean, cranky old racist who has a change of heart in ""Gran Torino"".  The journey Walt takes is just one of several making up the movie though.

  It starts with the funeral of Walt's beloved wife, who we never see but gather was somewhat of a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence as far as keeping his nastier character traits at bay.  In the days following the funeral we see Walt as alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections.  One of the things making him so bitter is that his neighborhood is becoming increasingly Asian in character.  North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or in some case dominated by one particular ethnic group.  This neighborhood has an increasing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it's safe to say that Walt hasn't been overjoyed to see their numbers increasing over the years.  At the start of the movie, he's a racist, not just 'old and set in his ways', not just 'narrow-minded', but outright racist.  The fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat it makes the character's transformation much more powerful.

  There are two main interpersonal 'pulls' in the movie - one is Walt's being pulled against his will into the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of around 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt's next door neighbor - being pulled against his will into a Hmong-dominated street gang.  He's cousin to one of the heads of the gang, and therefore, as the gang expands further and further from their traditional stomping grounds and into the suburbs, Thao gets invited to join.  In classic gang style, it's an offer he can't refuse.  So little by little he's getting sucked into this lifestyle that he very much wants to avoid, but appears powerless to.  His initiation feat into the gang is to steal his neighbor Walt's classic Gran Torino car.  When he's caught in the act and the other members flee, his family decides his punishment is to 'help out' Walt with yard work, household chores, etc. for the next little while, as atonement.  Walt isn't interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is pushed to try and make ammends anyway.  Not long after, an incident in the neighborhood involving the gang occurs, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by running a couple of gang members off.  To Walt's horror, this seems to spur the Hmong community in the neighborhood to 'adopt' him, arriving with gifts and baskets and food, always greeting him warmly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Walt doesn't like them very much.  Of course, despite his hostility towards Asians, he's never really known one outside of his experiences in the Korean War, where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have plenty of recollections of Koreans as the enemy, but few of the South Koreans as his side's allies).  As he's unwillingly drawn into the community, his feelings toward his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change...

  This may sound cliched or contrived, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes off that way.  Every characterization and interaction - good or bad - feels very genuine.  During this time we see Walt trying and failing to re-establish some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him being very shocked with himself that he's becoming so close to his 'new' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), to both of whom he seems to be filling some kind of uncle of even fatherly role.  Meanwhile though, the other pull is still going - the gang's determination to recruit Thao, seemingly motivated primarily by the fact that they're offended by the idea of anyone turning them down.  Thao is increasingly determined not to go that way, but that just seems to make the gang more insistent.  Gran Torino gives a really good picture of the hard spot someone like Thao is in when he's targeted for recruitment like this by a gang that might do anything at all if he doesn't go along with them.  It's a predicament his family sees, and that Walt comes to recognize as well.

  The movie becomes extremely intense in its end stages, building up to a tremendously powerful finale.  What's more unexpected is all the humor and, for lack of a better word, 'warmth' that starts coming in about a third of the way through.  These elements don't clash with the tension, but provide a counterpoint.  And as we see in the movie, things can turn from very 'happy' to very, very grim on a dime.

  An ability to juggle seemingly disparate tones, and universally excellent performances, help make Gran Torino a great movie on all levels.  For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can't go better than this one.",1272931200,3,4890,4.752075919335706

7450666,5,B015S4DS1K,"Walt Kowalski is a man who seems nearly impossible to get along with.  His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old ""virgin"" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.

Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.

One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his ""savior"" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.

Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  ""I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!"" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.

Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.

Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, ""You know nothing about life and death, kid.""  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.

Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excising yourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.

Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.",1272326400,3,4542,4.485958485958486

7450668,5,B015S4DS1K,"If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.

Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.

A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as ""I could use some good gook food,"" when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.

This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.

Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, ""Go ahead; make my day"" and ""Dyin's not much of a livin'."" Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence. The score, if you can call it that, is mellow and almost haunting.

There is not a dull moment in this film in what starts off as a seemingly bland plot. With a penchant for a wandering mind for average stories, I was not only transfixed watching it, but watched it two more times to pick up nuance I might have missed. I was never bored.

7450671,4,B015S4DS1K,"I had seen ""Gran Torino"" when it first came out in theaters: however, I took a second look at this film when it came to DVD, because my initial impression kept haunting me.  I have to say that I liked this movie very much.  I liked the story, a lost young man looking for his place in the world finding a mentor in the most unlikely of characters.  Filmed on location in Michigan, Clint Eastwood, directed and stars as a crusty widower, Korean vet, detached from his adult children and their family's, living out his days in a neighborhood settled mostly by Hmong people.  Newcomers to the screen are fledging actors, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, plus an appearance by Clint's son, Scott Eastwood has the small part of Trey (as Scott Reeves).  This movie is about change and values, about knowing who you are, and who you want to be.

Walt uses just about every racist term he can think of in this film.  His new neighbors consist of an Asian family consisting of a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's two children, Sue and Thao.  One characteristic between Americans and just about any other race is the matter of family.  Walter Kowalski, his two sons, moved out long ago, rarely visit, sits alone on his porch all day drinking beer and eating beef jerky.  On the other hand, his Asian neighbors have family and friends constantly visiting, bringing food and having family celebrations.  The movie focuses on Thao and his sister Sue as second-generation immigrants trying to find a niche in this country.  Thao, around 16, living in a female dominated household, content to read and garden, activities considered in Asian society as woman's work, is visibly lost.  His sister Sue, a few years older, describes their environment concisely, ""the women go to college the boys, go to jail.""  Matters worsen for Thao when his cousin, Spider approaches him to join his gang and receive protection from the other gangs.  The initiation to join the gang is to steal his neighbor, Walt's 1972 Gran Torino.  Thao botches the auto theft and runs home.  Too dark to see who was trying to steal his prize, Walt is unaware that it is his own neighbor, Thao.  The next evening, Spider and his gang come to give Thao another chance, but the boy's sister, mother, and grandmother interfere.  Spiders, gang of dropouts try to take Thao forcibly.  In the midst of the ruckus, Walt, armed with his army issue M1 Garand comes out Dirty Harry style and saves the day.  As the reluctant hero to the Hmong community, his neighbors shower him with gifts of flowers and food, arriving on his porch daily.  Sue, her mother, and Thao insist that Thao repays Walt for trying to steal his car by working for him.  Reluctantly, as Walt does not want anything to do with these people, agrees to the work arrangement and the two of them begin a journey together that make this an excellent movie.  The other character to watch for is Thao's sister Sue, although a stronger, smarter character than her brother, she too is a victim of her environment.

Right away, the acting of two supporting characters will come in question.  I say the supporting cast played their parts strong, and added a depth to the story, the human element.  Bee Vang's portrayal of Thao at times seems awkward, out of place and lost.  Teenaged boys, growing up without a strong male role model, are awkward, out of place and are certainly lost.  Bee Vang is a natural for this part.

Like the Dirty Harry movies, the Spaghetti westerns of Eastwood's early films, or even Pale Rider, or ""the Unforgiven,"" this movie stands out for the journey that each of the character make toward finding themselves.  Walt, Thao, Sue, Sue's grandmother, Father Janovich, and even Spider and his gang.  Each of the characters, making this journey of self discovery ties together throughout the movie by one thing, Walter Kowalski's 1972 Gran Torino.  The 1972 Gran Torino that Walt installed the steering column as it rolled out of the factory.  The Gran Torino that Thao attempted to steal, the Gran Torino that is the envy of the town, the Gran Torino that Walt's inconsiderate granddaughter asks for when he dies.  The Gran Torino that Thao must wash as part of his penitence, the Gran Torino that Walt allowed Thao drives his first date to the prom.  In the reading of Walt's Last Will & Testament, the Gran Torino does not go to his granddaughter, Ashley, who is an insensitive brat.  Instead, Walt gives the Gran Torino to Thao.  The Gran Torino gives Thao the opportunity for a new life.  The car, like Walt is an antique, a reminder of the past.

Gran Torino works on every level.  Eastwood absolutely shines as a old vet and autoworker who has two great pleasures in his life, his wife whose funeral begins the movie and his Gran Torino.  As Detroit changes and falls apart and the neighbors are increasingly Hmong he refuses to move despite all the prompts from his family.

Even better than Eastwood's performance is Ahney Her playing Sue Lor the girl next door whose brother becomes both the foe, then the friend of old man Kowalski.  Christopher Carley in his supporting role as the young parish priest also shines.

I'm not even talking about the rampant Archie Bunker-esque racist remarks coming from the mouth of angry old Mr. Kowalski, either. I'm talking about the fact that this was yet another movie in a long line of movies in which the non-white characters bumble through their lives as utter childlike idiots with no clue how to live, until a white man comes along and sets them straight.

The fact that it was up to this man to teach Thao (whose name Mr. Kowalski wouldn't even pronounce correctly, and everyone was fine with that, including Thao and his family) how to be a ""MAN"" really angered me. Did Thao just step out of a big white balloon? Does he have no other adults influencing his life? We know that his father is dead, but I distinctly saw other males in his house during the ceremony at the beginning. That's implying that there is, in fact, only one way to be a man, and that way is to be abrasive, assertive with women, use tools, and be quick with the ethnic slurs and the profanity. Wow. Just wow.

Speaking of the ethnic slurs, why are they okay? Why does no one call him on them? Sue even jokes with him about how her family doesn't eat dogs, only cats. Why does she do that? Why are they seen as something almost noble, an art form?

Thao also talks about how he couldn't get a job. Why not? It's not explored. It seems to me that it's not explored because it's not seen as important. We see that Thao is quiet, meek, and likes to garden, but we don't see anything else. He is not really a character in the movie, rather a means to an end. He's just there so he can be saved, transformed, and so Mr. Kowalski can be redeemed through him.

His sister Sue fares little better. She has more to do, but it's abundantly clear through the movie that since she is just a girl, she too will need to be saved, or avenged. It's just ridiculous. She starts out as a strong character, but ends up as just a victim. The gang member cousins dismiss her as just a woman, and so does the film.

Indeed, the only character with any development is Mr. Kowalski. Yes, Thao supposedly became a ""man"", but I didn't see much difference in how he behaved throughout the movie.

It could have been really good, and parts of it are very entertaining and funny. The part where Walt is in the Hmong family's basement, has no idea what to do, and ends up fixing their washing machine, only to have no one notice, was hilarious. I think the depiction of the ungrateful family who wants Walt's house and car were very well-done and realistic. And I admit, it is a pretty good redemption story at least in theory, but I keep forgetting it takes place in 2008 because the ideals are so dated. I honestly have seen episodes of ""Jonny Quest"" that are less blatantly racist, and that's a cartoon from the 60s.",1270339200,4,2824,4.347248576850095
7450675,4,B015S4DS1K,"Supposedly this is the last film Eastwood will appear in.

Frankly I believe this because he looks like warmed over death (and it's not the makeup) and titers around the screen looking like he is going to tip over at any moment.

He pulls from his quiver the usual gruff, no BS, hard characterization to play a recently widowed retired auto worker who finds his neighborhood, to his displeasure, largely populated with Moungs. There develops a relationship between him and some of his neighbors whom he slowly comes to like.  Alienated from his own sons he starts to mentor the boy next door who lacks a father figure and is under pressure to join a gang.

Eastwood has made many many moves.  Some terrible in ever aspect, some well crafted.  Consistency in quality is not Eastwood's strong suit.

The film is good, not one of his top efforts but worth watching.  If you like Eastwood's acting then this is a must see as it is apparently the end of an era.",1269734400,,956,4.549707602339181

7450687,5,B015S4DS1K,"Critics call Gran Torino a Dirty Harry movie. Not! You must be confused or uncaring to align Gran Torino with Dirty Harry.

Dirty Harry was licensed violence with an unbeatable never say die spirit protecting the American way of life from the underbelly scum of life.

Walt Kowalski is a defeated, deformed & hate filled balloon of self-pity hiding behind a mask of uncaring obscenities & the assurance of his own rightness.

He's been hurt in a very real manner, by the war, the American society's rejection of him & his buddies, by the ability of those ""gooks"" to follow him across an ocean. He's hurt by the kind of kids his family has grown up to be, by how that growing up dishonors his memory of his wife (the greatest woman in the world).

The death of his wife who was the great love of his life & the only love of post Vietnam era life he viewed as the final betrayal of life itself. Other women would be off limits as they couldn't possibly measure up to the best woman in the world.
It is what makes his don't come near me behavior completely unbending.

Enter Sue Lor: He did his best I'm a foul mouthed, gook hating, no good American war vet act & she: well she wasn't shocked or repulsed or scared. She's just disconcertingly straightforward & quietly persistent. By god, she's a little mystifying. She's, She's sorta like the best woman in the world. It was these qualities that attracted his positive attention & allowed Sue to restore his faith in women along with the Hmong family restoring his faith in society. Remember the line, ""By god I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family.""

He says to himself: Self he says (sorry I couldn't stop it), we need to check this out closer. Hope is reborn! He thinks, what she likes will be worthy of liking, what she loves will be worthy of loving & what she dislikes will be dishonorable. He still understands & believes in honor & dishonor. It's the only thing that has kept him from descending to a beast.

The Hmong had everything that he wanted in a person, a family & a society except maybe bravery displayed by action. He now has a cause & a purpose. THIS AIN'T DIRTY HARRY. It's Romeo & Juliet without the sex.

From my great enemy is sprung my great love. Just because it's a thought from a Vietnam vet about a Hmong family does not reduce the truth & wonder of that statement. Once again, remember the line: ""My god, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family."" I would add their society also.

The most un-Dirty Harry like thing of this show (it's huge) is the fact that it starts with a man that has given up on life. His wife is gone, his kids suck & his health is gone. This isn't the kinda guy that lays in bed waiting for the grim reaper. He is looking for a way to commit suicide without dishonor. If you didn't pick up on the suicide bit early maybe you were Dirty Harry befuddled too. His sacrifice at the end was his honorable cause.

The first time he coughs up blood I told my wife, ""He's a suicide looking for a place & a reason to happen."" The only value he had retained at that point was honor so he couldn't sit down & ""eat"" his rifle. Having found another best & honorable woman he felt he could follow her to a suitable cause. His relationship with Thao was instigated by Sue not the attempted theft. He then found his cause through Thao. The giving of his life reflects his rediscovered belief that life is worthwhile & something to die for is good. He had that going to Vietnam & lost it there.

Now he is full cycle: From disillusionment & hate back to hope & love. He surely loves the people he gave his life for & hopes it improves their life.

I was pleasantly surprised that the beating & rape of Sue didn't unhinge his mind again (the suicide was already planned folks).It was as if he finally understood THERE ISN'T JUST ONE BEST PERSON IN THE WORLD THERE ARE MANY. His faith was restored.

Tremendous show!",1269302400,3,3957,4.331081081081081
7450688,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood is still a badass, even in old age, and Gran Torino (2008) proves it.  We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.

His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.

I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.

""A Mexican, a Jew, and a coloured guy walk into a bar.  The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'""

The above ""joke"" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)

This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or ""Toad"" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that ""They won't stand a chance [against me].""

(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)

Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.

For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.

This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie ""Million Dollar Baby"").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.

Eastwood can make ""Get off my lawn"" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's ""Make my day.""  When he says, ""I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby,"" he sounds as if he means it.

Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.

This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.

(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)

The song in the movie titled ""Gran Torino"" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.

This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning ""Best Actor"" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.

In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:

""I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.""

7450719,5,B015S4DS1K,"It's my understanding that Clint Eastwood intends to ""hang up his spurs"" as far as acting goes. Not that anyone could possibly blame him. This film the best I've seen in quite some time. Other reviewers talked about the bigotry but I see it more as diversity & cultural misunderstanding & how it can be overcome given the opportunity. It also shows that our country is changing rapidly & will probably never be the same.

I learned a lot about the Hmong people that I wasn't aware of before, it even made me do a little more research about them. They are an amazing culture. I like the fact that most of the actors were native Hmong which gave the film a sense of realism, as well as the fact that it was filmed ""on location"" as opposed to Hollywood. All of the casting was superior.

I have noticed a lot of thinly veiled references to many of Mr. Eastwood's prior films in this one which I found very amusing. I'd swear that ""Daisy"" is the same dog from ""Outlaw Josey Wales"" (gladly he didn't spit on her head - but the scene with Grandma was priceless!) The relationship with Grandma seemed familiar (even though she didn't speak English) to Granny from ""Outlaw"" (mutual tolerance). There was also some ""tobacco-spitting"" included). It seemed like some of the character from ""Heartbreak Ridge"" was in Walt, just maybe later in life. There might have been a small amount of ""Dirty Harry"" in there as well. Watch it & I think you'll see what I'm talking about.

Even though there is a lot of sadness in this film, there is also an abundance of classic humor as well. The way Walt used ""Toad"" to pay back his ""debt"" was priceless (""wasp nest, now that's terrible"")! The barbershop scene was also great!

The scene in the basement (during the party) begs the question: What does it say about our society when an 80 year old terminally ill man has to level a dryer when there is a room full of young able bodied young men watching him do it? Where will we be when there aren't any more ""Walt's"" left?

This film also depicts a lot of the problems that our own culture has (family interaction, etc.) It was really disgusting the way that Walt's family treated him but sadly it's too commonplace these days.

Every time I watch this film it makes me sad that it will most likely be the last time we'll see Mr. Eastwood in front of the camera... Every time I watch the movie I feel that he's trying to tell us something more (about himself personally?).

7450746,5,B015S4DS1K,"The Gran Torino, as a car, is a vivid symbol of a glorious past when the blue collar worker was economically well off and America, especially industrial towns like Detroit were prosperous. Clintwood shoots the film in Detroit in contemporary US with the auto industry down on its knees and where new immigrants have moved into the homes earlier owned by white Americans like Kowalski. Whatever the change in demographics, the basic problems of crime or gang warfare and territorial passions remain unchanged. The ethnicity may have changed, but the human condition has not. We see the slow evolution of Kowalski from a being an unabashed racist to a 'humanist' if I may use the word in context. With Clint Eastwood, violence remains as a constant -- something that does not change but has to be handled. And Kowalski is portrayed as a Korean war veteran whose been there and done that. Death is something that he has experienced first hand and I liked the poignant moment when he tells the priest that he knows very little of death. In fact, the hard life that he has experienced has brought a sense of irreverance to faith and religion. In fact in his stage of life, when the majority in his age group would gravitate towards religion, the opposite happens to Kowalski and it this is extremely well portrayed by Clint Eastwood. He would rather sort out the dilemmas of life himself than rely on a youngster just out of a seminary. To my mind, through this portrayal Eastwood is making a statement about religion and the intermediaries between man and God, who may not have the experience and judgment to advise as they do and about organized religion of all forms. In a completely stunning, well planned, meticulously thought out move, Eastwood uses death as a surprise. His meticulous and langorous planning for the grand finale (including the winding up of his affairs, leaving the dog at his neighbours and making peace with the priest, if not the almighty) and leaving the Gran Torino not to his grand daughter but to his new friends, not only speaks about what goes on in the community, but his own personal transformation as a human being and preparation for the final journey, when all worldly confusion has come to an end. I have watched all the movies that Clint Eastwood has made over the years. This one is outstanding, with the same kind of subtle acting that we saw in Bridges of Maddison County or A Million Dollar Baby. Arguably, this is his best as an actor. It is a complex piece of movie making made simple through that art of great story telling and a very sure and mature thought process.

The movie is set in Detroit.  The economics of the times are clear and Clint plays Walt Kowalski as a racist that knows all the slurs in the book.  He is wrathful, prideful, and refuses to leave a neighborhood he is familiar with.  He sees the neighborhood deteriorating, but perseveres in holding his place.  He was well-trained in war and alert and ready for the neighborhood gangs as attempts are made to steal his prized possession, a Pontiac Gran Torino.

This is a racial morality story, but also about personal bonds that form as we learn to live together in a changing world. There is bitter humor and deep caring as the characters learn to know each other and forget stereotypes.

In the end, Walt gives wisdom and strength to a struggling immigrant family, as well as his most powerful performance.

Eastwood's characted Walt Kowalski is no so keen and eager on adjusting.  It is the death of his wife and her funeral that break heart watching this growling man come to terms that the term ""dysfunctional family"" has a whole new meaning for his own.

As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!
AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!
I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.
When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.
I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.

The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.

I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.

Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.

Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.

The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.",1261267200,2,1731,4.079411764705882

His life used to be more predictable, Now he struggles with the changing culture around him, to the point that he sticks out like a sore thumb.  But while the movie has a simple plot line, it certainly doesn't have a simple message.  In fact, Eastwood takes on some of the hardest hitting themes in our society today with such ease, I can't imagine another director or actor doing a better job.

The movie is nothing short of amazing, and definitely describes the lost generation between the ""greatest"" and the ""baby boomer"".  His open hostility towards other races is not hidden, yet through the movie he embraces the very culture he says he hates.

7450779,4,B015S4DS1K,"Clint as everyone knows is a great talent in both acting and directing. And here he does both, giving a fine performance as Walt Kowalski, a war veteran and retired Ford worker living in Detroit. We pick up Kowalski's story at the funeral of his long time wife. As an unemotional type he will grieve in his own quiet way. We learn at the wake that he has a strained relationship with his 2 grown sons and their families. They have moved on to the greener pastures of the suburbs while Walt stays in his old decaying urban neighborhood. The movie makes the most of the on location filming in Detroit. The dying city is filmed with great effect. You see Clint's character moving through very troubled neighborhoods with vacant storefronts, crime, rundown and abandoned homes. It is sad and unfortunate that this is a true portrayal of Detroit.

As someone born and raised in Detroit everything is dead on in it's portrayal of this slowly dying city. I saw a parallel with my own upbringing as I also lived in a neighborhood that changed from predominatly white. My Father had many of the same racist notions that Kowalski has here. And Kowalski has no problem slamming just about every ethnic or racial group- Jews, Asians, Blacks, Latinos, Italians etc.. No group is left out of his (often funny) racist tirades. In finding them humorous I do not claim to share his views or endorse his racially insensitive remarks. It's just the way that Kowalski so proudly takes ownership of his beliefs that make them funny.

My father and other racists I have encountered had no problem offering up racist commentary but usually reserved their comments for private conversations. Walt Kowalski is way over the top, he gets right up in there face and does it. In one scene he is invited to a family gathering in a house full of Hmong people. Even though he is the only white amongst them he has no problem referring to them as 'fishheads.'

There are interesting performances here - the young priest who challenges Kowalski to come clean with God. The Italian barber who exchanges funny and racist banter with Walt. The young Hmong siblings who befriend Walt and break down his barriers. And this is where the story leads us as Walt gets drawn into helping the young Hmong boy, Tao, who is being troubled by a violent gang. The title of the movie refers to Kowalski's mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. a classic car that he actually had a hand in building at the auto plant. In this troubled neighborhood it is coveted by friend and foe alike. Many of the Asian actors are newcomers and you would think that next to the shining star that is Eastwood they would drag down the film. For the most part that doesn't happen.

A fascinating relationship develops between him and the neighbor teenagers--a young man and a young woman. Of all the roles I've seen Eastwood in, this by far is the best--his facial expressions say more than any words he says. His directing is simple, impactive, and straightforward--no hi-tech frills and stunts--and it serves the story quite well. The script also works well, and the ending offers a heartrending surprise, definitely against the grain for Eastwood, but thoroughly believable and exemplary.

7450800,5,B015S4DS1K,"Well, after all the hype, I can say with complete honesty- this movie moved me in the way I was hoping it would.

For the last several months I've been trying to find a way to watch Gran Torino.  All year long it was like the number one movie on my mind that I felt I simply HAD to watch.

All the awards the film won, all the frequent mentions of Clint Eastwood blowing us away with his performance, and...

the film was actually as good as most people said it would be.  This doesn't happen very often!

I was seriously moved by the engaging storyline from beginning to end.

Clint Eastwood playing the role of a stubborn old man that none of his family seems to care about and becoming bitter and angry at the world as a result was delivered *flawlessly*

I'm a bit surprised the storyline focused so much on Clint's character building a relationship between his neighbors and himself, and less on the part about trying to protect his home from the never-ending gang fights taking place outside.

The actual gang fights were about 50% of the film, while the other half dealt with Clint and the young boy from next store getting to know each other better and building a friendship through patience, hard work and a willingness for Clint to finally open up and accept his neighbors.

This is truly a great movie with an ending that might move you in a way you've never felt before.  It's a bit of a shocking ending to me, but I guess the more I think about it while typing up this review, it's the kind of ending to be expected.

I can't think of another way to make the outcome more realistic, while also keeping in mind that the intention of the writers while putting together this film was to make an impact on the viewers, let's put it that way.

There's a couple hidden messages behind the storyline as well- always accept others, don't be so quick to judge, and never follow through with your initial reactions.  There's also a message that you can in fact change people who are always in trouble with the law.

7450821,5,B015S4DS1K,"After reflection, discussion and further reflection, I'm raising my rating from  4 to 5 stars for this late-career Eastwood achievement.  Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, ""There Will Be Blood"" stands out as the most ""artful""--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to ""tell the story"" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, ""Gran Torino"" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as ""heroes"" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, ""Gran Torino"" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.

I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary ""action"" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to ""father""--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.

These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two ""basic needs"": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)

In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the ""intentional fallacy"" (""Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question""; or ""You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different."").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to ""equalize"" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before ""Gran Torino"" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.

I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a ""noirish"" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like ""Tightrope"" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.

[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).  So either way--a gun or a lighter--the object in his left shirt pocket is emblematic of his end, the only question being whether it will be instantaneous or prolonged. It's even plausible that he knows his days are numbered and chooses what he believes is the best way out for all concerned.]",1257033600,3,6321,4.917293233082707

No one is going to accuse Gran Torino of being subtle and the performances by the neophyte Hmong actors sometimes aren't great, but the film is undeniably effective, with much more humor than expected (to be honest I laughed more in this film than in most comedies) a pitch-perfect performance by Clint and an ending slightly but significantly different than I predicted; it's not the greatest film Clint's ever made but it's a solid piece of entertainment.

7450854,5,B015S4DS1K,"Saw this one in the theater.  Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of ""action"" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look. It was a very enjoyable movie.

7450866,5,B015S4DS1K,"There was a time when I couldn't have believed I could actually enjoy the rough,
violent, anti-PC atmosphere of a film with the name ""Clint Eastwood"" attached to it.
Not only did I enjoy this film, I found it to be the most wonderfully touching,
funny, heartwrenching movie I've seen in a long, long time. That it is all that,
yet still remains faithful to the Eastwood rough, violent, anti-PC image, is a
remarkable feat.

  Even the most successful film directors reach a point in their careers when their
output begins to fade as they get to retirement age. Clint Eastwood is the rare
exception. At 78, he has hit his peak with this film. As recently widowed, embittered Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski, he seems ready to live out the twilight
of his years sitting on his front porch and grousing about the stinkin' world. But
when the next-door neighbors, a family of Hmong immigrants, are threatened by the
local gangs, he finds himself goin' for his guns and standing up against the thugs
in the tradition of Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish.""

  But what starts out as a vigilante revenge story quickly blossoms into a moving
drama as Kowalski warms (in his gritty, teeth-clenched fashion) to his neighbors.
He takes the family's son under his wing and teaches him lessons about life, work,
and romance. Just when you think the story is edging toward sentimentality, there
is a sudden, shocking twist, one that Kowalski and his surrogate son struggle to
overcome. Which Kowalski eventually does, in a poignant ending that both resolves
his crises and redeems his life. It is one of the most spiritually satisfying
endings of any films in recent years.

  If you don't think you're the type to enjoy a Clint Eastwood film, think again.

7450888,5,B015S4DS1K,"Having appeared in practically every male oriented movie genre in his long career, Clint Eastwood has matured into one of the finest directors and actors the industry - and the public - have seen.

  Nearing 80, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a character of roughly the same age. His wife has just died and Walt is living alone in his home of many years, the last Caucasian in a neighborhood that is suffering severely from ""diversity"". Kowalski retains the characteristics of the America he grew up in. He is an unrepentant racist, cursing his Hmong neighbors, the Latinos and blacks who, in his eyes, have destroyed his neighborhood. His is a rough camaraderie where ""real men"" zestfully hurl ethnic insults at each other.

  We quickly learn that Kowalski barely speaks with his two grown sons and their families. They have never, it seems, lived up to his expectations. A far too young and callow priest visits Kowalski, urging him to take confession because his late wife wanted him to. Kowalski reacts as you might expect.

  The next door neighbors are Hmongs. While Walt smokes his cigarettes and drinks his beer on the front porch, the Hmong grandmother glares at him, muttering insults in Hmong. Eastwood does the same in English.

  Kowalski spent three years fighting in Korea and we learn early through the explorations of his obnoxious grandchildren that he has some sort of medal from his service. He returned to work on the Ford assembly line for 50 years.

  Now he is alone. Old and alone. He has only his smokes, his beer and Jim Beam, his dog Daisy and his 1972 Ford Grand Torino.

  Next door live the Hmong family with two Americanized children, Sue, a girl in her later teens and Thao, who is something of a momma's boy. A Hmong gang wants Thao to join and isn't very gentle in its persuasion.

  Kowalski, belying his years, rescues Thao once and then his sister Sue, establishing himself as a hero in a neighborhood held hostage to the gangs.

  A reluctant friendship grows between Kowalski and the Hmong, particularly with the young Thao, to whom he becomes a mentor.

  Dramatic events pile up quickly and Kowalksi is clearly on a path with his destiny in his dreary Detroit suburb.

  Eastwood directed this magnificent film and his acting is superb. He has Kowalski's character down pat. Others may see the resonance between ""Gran Torino"" and John Wayne's last two films. Eastwood is aware of his aging and he plays the part as if it were real - perhaps because it is.

  I was uncomfortable with some parts, perhaps because it seemed to give up too much to ""diversity"" and ""multi-culturalism"" without asking some obvious questions. But I certainly can't fault the movie for that.

  In its own way, this film is as great as ""The Unforgiven"", not so much for the story (which is good) but because of Eastwood's direction and acting. He milks this story for all that it is worth - and that is a compliment.

Walt ( clint Easwood ) is a Korean War Vet . He is retired .

He doesn't want to mess around or mingle with people. He hates the new generation . One incident changes his life ""Gran Torino"" .

Every one is behind his classic car 1972 made Gran Torino. Gran Torino is one reason , he gets close to next door Asian neighbors. Then the movie goes on with all the emotions , relationship up's and down .

2. Clint Eastwood dialogs in the movie relate to the Dirty Harry version like  ""I will blow a hole in your face and then sleep like a baby .

3. This movie is named Gran Torino as everybody who comes in his life wants the Gran Torino . Because of Gran Torino , he made new friends from next door neighbors.

4. This is about a guy you don't want to mess with . this reminds me of Dirty Harry version. '

5. In this movie , Clint Eastwood has grown old and the world has changed for him . the movie shows how a old man ( retired war vet) tries to adjust in today's world .

6. Brilliant performance by Clint Eastwood. Terrific Characterization . This should be considered as one of the classic movies of Clint Eastwood .

7. It is a movie which shows relationship with different ages/races .

Sitting at the opposite end of the spectrum from some earlier films such ""Every Which Way But Loose"", this is among Eastwood's more cerebral films.  Although rated R for very strong language and violence, it is not an action adventure film but rather a thought provoking film along the lines of ""Unforgiven"".

My only minor constructive criticism is that the first act moves a little slow and the film does not develop its momentum until about ten minutes in.  Perhaps the opening scenes could have been cut a little tighter.

7450932,4,B015S4DS1K,"Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...

There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him ""how to be a man""---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.

So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, ""Gran Torino"" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.

My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?

I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and ""masculinity""---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos. Well, unless all the macho car gushing is part of Eastwood's hidden joke.",1251849600,,2560,5.037914691943128

7450946,5,B015S4DS1K,"This great script about personal redemption & the values that unite us, regardless of race, is not only laugh out loud hilarious thanks to more instantly quotable one-liners than I can recall in any movie from recent years, but also incredibly moving.

Unlike so many other directors who showboat their style in a 'Hey Ma, look at me! I'm directing a movie!' kind of way, Eastwood's direction is like a gentle breeze, it's so light, so delicate, you're barely even aware of it. Instead you're right where you want to be be; engrossed in the story & gripped by these wonderful characters. And what a story!

Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an elderly widower surrounded by Hmong immigrants with foreign ways that he despises, living in a decrepit neighborhood & pestered by his own ghastly family who can't wait to shove him into a retirement home so they can grab his house. He keeps his own home & property neatly tendered, in stark contrast to those around him. Walt is, in effect, the proverbial civilised man surrounded by the barbarians.

But when Tao, the shy Hmong kid from next door is pressured by a local gang into trying to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, the stage is set for a culture clash. That Walt ends up befriending Tao probably won't come as a surprise but the exact manner in which Walt warms to his Hmong neighbors, his mysterious guilt over an incident from his Korean war days, how Tao learns to stand on his own two feet & the presence of the Hmong gang who haven't forgotten Tao, are developed & resolved in wholly unexpected ways. We think we know where this is going simply because we've all seen Eastwood films before. But just as he did with Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood has one heck of a surprise in store, an ending that not only cuts deep but makes perfect sense & in ways we had not anticipated.

To say more would spoil the fun but Eastwood's fearless, pull no punches approach to race & culture is an absolute blast from start to finish, & Eastwood the actor is electrifying in the lead role. There is something thrilling in the way a nearly 80 yr old man can hold the screen so effortlessly. Other stars lose charisma as they age but Eastwood's only seems to increase. As one reviewer noted, this is possibly the only film in the history of American cinema in which a 78 yr old man convincingly kicks the ass of a guy 60 years his junior!

Aside from Clint the young cast of non-professional Hmong actors are all fine with Bee Vang (Tao), & Ahney Herr (Sue), believable & likable as the young Hmong teens next door. They have an un-Hollywood quality to them that makes their performances pleasingly natural & amongst the professional cast Christopher Carley (as Fthr Janovitch) & John Carroll Lynch (Martin the Barber) are excellent.

I don't believe for a second that this is Eastwood's final screen performance & after Gran Torino's huge success - it ranks as Eastwood's most profitable film ever at the box-office - the studios doubtless can't get enough scripts to him fast enough. But if it is then Eastwood has found a role that's the perfect capstone to the urban tough guys he's so memorably played over the decades.

When Walt walks off to that final showdown, quite willing to go to the wall for those who share his values, it's impossible not to sense the ghosts of Harry Callahan & The Man With No Name walking with him. ""The world is nothing more than all the tiny things you left behind.. "" runs the beautiful ballad sung by Clint & Jamie Cullum that closes the film.

7450952,5,B015S4DS1K,"Warning: Contains minor spoilers.

I finally saw Gran Torino six months after it didn't win Academy awards.  After waiting for so long I figured it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.  Anticipating some anticlimactic, less ethnic Boondock Saints, I resigned myself to catch up with Clint Eastwood's revered vision.  Despite myself, I became totally absorbed.  The film was ethnic, religious, and more interesting than I'd even heard.

Archetypes in film are usually boring.  I can't stand it when a movie is full of flat, one-dimensional characters doing exactly what the viewer expects them to do.  At first I was distracted by the number of one-dimensional characters in Gran Torino.  Set in a ghetto at the edge of a Ford factory town, it's a perfect illustration of ethnic and temporal clash to characterize America's history.

Perhaps the setting is even more perfect now, with Bud falling to inBev and GM falling to Congress.  In the very first scene the main character buries his wife.  A laughably archetypical young, Irish priest drones about life and death while Clint Eastwood rolls his eyes heavenward, his estranged family unsurprisingly irreverent.

All the elements are there.  It's so expected it's annoying.  Ethnic stereotype. Check.  Industrious old man irritated that his young family doesn't get it.  Check.  It's about family, it's about America, it's about the working class in fringe neighborhoods that have always made this country strong.  Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a ""Polack"" who would've been among the first wave of Ford-strong workers.  See also his hair dresser, a machismo Italian Kowalski accuses of being ""half-Jew"" when he charges a wopping (ahem) $[...] for his monthly haircut belongs to that same storied first generation.

Every element in this movie is one-dimensional, and yet . . . it's perfect.  Eastwood's character rejects the Irish priest, charged by his late wife with the task of ""taking special care of this sheep"" in his ""flock"" of parishioners, when the priest begins hounding him to confess.  When pressed, Kowalsk shares a beer with the priest, wet behind the ears next to Eastwood's hard-lined complexion.  He explains that the ""overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold superstitious old women's hands and make promises he can't keep"" knows nothing about life and death.  Kowalski spent three years killing (even, we later learn, when not so ordered) in Korea.  He calls the priest ""Padre,"" rather than the deferential, traditional ""Father.""

Only later, after a few ethnic in's and out's, does Kowalski accept a religious touch.  Evidently it's not that he rejects religion; he only needs a father figure, as do we all, to provide spiritual guidance.  A Hmong shaman ""reads"" him (predictably) exactly right.  Kowalski is stunned, coughs up blood, shares solace and rice alcohol with a member of that family, and his fatherly bond is sealed.

Gran Torino is not about the characters.  Each player is only a vehicle for Eastwood's point.  Indeed, while the characters are flat, the acting is rather good.  The youngest Hmong cousin, haunted by a family gang and first exposed to Kowalski when he tried to steal the title car, is young and weak (Kowalski later calls him a ""puss-bag"") at first.  He's smart but unfocused--the ghetto offers little in the way of goals.  We pretty clearly see the kid grow under Kowalski's influence.  The former soldier teaches ""Toad"" to paint a house, hammer a roof, tend to a garden.  He takes him to see the barber and teaches him to ""talk like a man"" (NB: the barber is reading a 1935-style porn when the boys walk in, with women stretched out like the silhouettes on truck mudflaps).  Kowalski rags on Toad to date a beautiful Hmong girl (""Yum Yum"") who keeps giving him the eye.

In short, Kowalski imparts self respect through productive actions.  He's kind of a Hank Hill (from King of the Hill) in the gratuitously-stereotypical neighborhood.  He finds himself, like a serendipitous vigilante, in a position to save the Hmong Su from a black gang.  Su sasses the thugs for calling her a ""bitch and a ho in the same sentence--way to be a stereotype.""  Kowalski finds himself a role model for a huge Asian ethnic group with historically weak male role models (""girls go to school; boys go to jail""), and a savior where no one else can stop the intrafamiliar gangs that seem to pervade the ghetto.

The ending is somewhat suprising.  We know that Kowalski faces painful treatments for the rest of his life to eradicate whatever evil caused the thick blood in his cough.  He finally confesses, spilling three sins that tarnish the very soul of a man with integrity, but elicit only a ""that's it?"" from the ghetto priest.  He buys a suit, retools his will, and has long-since accepted that his ""family"" are the Hmong he respects, not the second-generation Toyota-drivers (predictably) pushing Dad to a home.  What's surprising isn't that he dies, but that the ending preserves the flat, illustrative essence of each character while managing to weave them perfectly in as coherent a finish as the rest of the film.

The movie isn't surprising, but it's still beautiful.  We have lost so much of the integrity once the heart of the American dream.  Those  of us who wail about politics cite anecdotal evidence so far removed from personal experience that we might as well be opining on the European Union.*  I loved this film for taking one-dimensional archetypes easy to understand and weave a story around them that's faceted, intelligent, more profoundly true than merely political, and . . . perfect.

Where Boondock Saints made me want to go vigilante on gangsters' asses, this movie made me want to tend to the margins.  I wanted to go home and fold clothes haphazardly tucked into the drawer.  I wanted to wash my car, care for my things, perhaps consider a victory garden.  I wanted to drop the multi-dimensional pretexts that detract from integrity and simply do things right.

This movie reminded me that the American Dream with which I'm so obsessed isn't about making it big (though it's about that too), but rather about making it.  It's only the sum total of tucked hospital corners, waxed hubcaps, crossed t's and dotted i's that make a college education, a marriage (save Kowalski's indiscretion in 1968 with Betty Jablonski at a company Christmas party), and a life.

So in the end the movie is--predictably!--about life and death.  All the usual elements are there: religion, intrigue, ethnic warfare and paternal protection.  Kowalski finds purpose in his last months, and, after a life well-lived, finally finds something for which he's ready to die.  Nothing about this film is particularly surprising.  But the skill behind weaving these flat elements is impeccable.  There are worse things than living with purpose and integrity, and in the end finding the story to be perfect.",1250812800,,6903,4.987740805604203

7450969,5,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is actor/director Clint Eastwood's best film, hands down.  The way he coordinates the demands of his increasing age with the remarkably bitter and yet deeply decent character, Walt Kowalski, reflects a man rigorously dedicated not only to his art but to making sense of the ruthless, ultra macho image that has been created around him since ""Dirty Harry"".

Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean veteran who lives in a bad area of Detroit with the Humungs, a group of Koreans who fought with the United States in Vietnam and relocated to various economically impoverished areas.  Walt liberally uses the terms gook, spook, dragon people, and an assorted list of racial epithets that fire off so easily one can't help be amused by them.  He's a man of a different generation and is not a ""value racist"": this is how he has emerged from warfare and 1950's Americana.

Walt is in some ways like a ghost.  The values he cherishes--extreme masculinity, tribal patriotism, family, and even the proper way to approach the tabernacle in the Catholic Church--seem to be disappearing before his eyes.  His faith is also questionable at the beginning of the film. After his wife's funeral, he tells a young priest that he has no desire whatsoever to confess to an ""overeducated 27 year virgin who holds the hands of old women and promises them eternal life.""

His Korean neighbors reciprocate his feelings of animosity.  There are parts of this fim that are drop dead funny because political correctness is dropped entirely.  Walt is not unlike the racist grandparents some of us have had, and if we have, we immediately feel a mix of repugnance and adoration for his absolute certitude in all situations.  Including putting an M-1 to the head of a gangster who steps on his lawn.

Thao, a young Korean who lives near Walt, is pressured by his cousin to join the local gang.  After mistakenly trying to fit in with the gang and steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, which he built himself,
they see him as a punk but still insist he try another criminal act to be initiated into the gang.

The rest of the film is a meditation on mortality, self sacrifice, and what it means to love another group of people regardless of race, ethnicity, or anything.  The ending, though sad, is also beautiful.

Maybe the director has some twisted sense of humor. An actor who steps out of character AFTER EVERY UTTERANCE should not hog the camera but should be hidden from it. After his every belch of ""LET ME AOOOUUUT WALT, LET ME AOOOUUT NOW"", he looks awkwardly around the room as though he's saying ""that was good guys right? eh? eh?"", proceeding to say ""WALT LET ME AOOOOUUTT!"".

I love Clint, but everyone loved 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' (more like 'Million Dollar Boredom') and I thought those movies were boring as hell.

Let me say before I swiftly bash this movie that Clint Eastwood is arguably the greatest of movie stars.  This guy has been in more classics and played some of the terrific characters to ever grace the silver screen.

My guess is that this will be his last starring role and maybe that was what he intended when making it.  It doesn't really end the way most Eastwood films end in that he kills just about everyone in his path.  Maybe this is just a metaphor for a 'dying movie star', so to speak.  The way Harry Callahan or Philo Beddoe or Blondie would have handled these situations...well there would be some bodies left behind and/or a lot of people severely beaten left in his dust.  This isn't a bad thing, but the message I got from the ending was that Clint is showing us that he doesn't have to use his guns or fists as he rides off into the sunset as a motion picture actor.

'Gran Torino' isn't really much of anything, really.  I can tell you that the script is appallingly bad and the acting by absolutely everyone involved is even worse.

It's grumpy old man who hates everyone befriends neighbors he despises because he opens his heart up when they leave flowers and chicken dumplings on his doorstep.  Perhaps those relationships would be more entertaining and believable if ANYONE in that house next door could act a lick or was remotely likable.

The first hour and twenty minutes are a complete and total bore and you will be asking whoever is unfortunate enough to suffer through it along with you, ""What the hell is this movie about?""  At least something actually takes place in the last twenty minutes of the thing, but the closure is a major disappointment.

I don't know if this is supposed to be about what Rocky Balboa told all of those Soviets in 'Rocky IV' about ""If I can change and you can change, EVERYBODY can change"" or what...but it was very, very bland, boring and horribly acted.  It would be a better story if he finally found good in some people upon opening his mind/heart and actually spoke to his children every once in awhile, but that whole scenario is just tossed under the door mat.

I hate to think that this could be (and probably is) Clint's final starring role.  He's probably my favorite 'movie star', but I'm not going to bow down for him just because it's him like everyone in Hollywood seemed to do upon this release.

Just say no to the Gran Torino, ya dig??",1249862400,13,2793,4.52589641434263
7450977,5,B015S4DS1K,"I initially begged off seeing ""Gran Torino"" as I assumed I got the gist from preview trailers, but you know what happens when you assume, right?  I was expecting the clichd Clint Eastwood ending and after seeing ""Gran Torino"" was instead quite stunned and surprised, yet I shouldn't have been.  If anything Eastwood has evolved far beyond the ""Dirty Harry"" days and if anything has become as much as an artist in front of the lens as behind it.  Thinking of his more recent movies, Eastwood has transcended his earlier on-screen personas and evolved into something far deeper.

""Gran Torino"" is as much character driven as plot driven and Eastwood's character Harvey Kowalski is as much the antithesis of Dirty Harry as he is the antithesis of a vigilante.  A retired autoworker and Korean War Veteran, Kowalski is also a recent widower watching the transition and decline of his Detroit neighborhood where he and his late wife raised their children.  When touching on his somewhat estranged children ""Gran Torino"" becomes a vehicle for satire, emphasizing the dislocation and detachment of modern society.  Kowalski feels about as connected to his children and grandchildren as he does to the equally alien Hmong family next door.  Opening with the funeral service for his late wife ""Gran Torino"" sets the tableau of dislocation and despair in his neighborhood.  Kowalski's antagonism and dislocation with seemingly everyone is pled out with his neighbors, his children, the parish priest, and his neighborhood.  The feelings of rejection and helplessness pervade the movie: children give up on parents, parents give up on children, neighbors give up on their community and the community crumbles around them.  Without giving the plot away events unfold where Kowalski feels compelled to intervene on behalf of his neighbors and the community reacts in a way that catches Kowalski off-guard.  Slowly Kowalski is pulled closer into the Hmong community as he grapples with his wartime demons and his distant children.  The closer Kowalski gets to the Hmong the more the film builds to its stunning climax, and the climax is unlike anything you'd expect form a Clint Eastwood movie.

I don't want to spoil the ending, but much like ""Million Dollar Baby"" and other recent Eastwood movies your mouth will be hanging open as it is not the ending you would expect.  That's because Eastwood has truly become the cinematic master, defying expectations and here offering up a sharp contrast that made me a fan of his work all over again.  There wasn't as much violence as I expected, and Eastwood totally chews up the scenery with an economy of words that are truly impressive.  His facial expressions communicate more than words ever could.  There is some VERY politically incorrect language presented quite frankly here but it serves a purpose.  I'd questioned how good ""Gran Torino"" could be and it is easily one of the best movies of the past year, if not one of Eastwood's best.  It is a fitting coda to every Dirty Harry movie and all of his Spaghetti Westerns rolled into one.

7450981,4,B015S4DS1K,"I watched most of his films, and even reruns of Rawhide. The only thing I ever really liked was his early 70's movie ""Play Misty for Me,"" where he showed some emotion other than rage. I know some of his more recent films like ""Million Dollar Baby"" were more well rounded, but I was already too turned off by the gratuitous violence of his earlier films; but he always was, and is, his own man.
But shockingly to me, Gran Torino brought Clint, and his career, to a much more conciliatory, and ironically peaceful. higher ground through his enlightening encounter with Hmong culture.

Prior to seeing GT, I had read a book on the Hmong culture, Anne Fadiman's ""The Spirit Catches You and You all Fall down.""  They had been an independent ethnic thorn in the side to the Han Chinese dynasties for centuries, before being forced to migrate to the highlands of Laos. During the Vietnam War they were offered various trinkets by the US military invaders to aid them in that awful war. Well,(General) Westmoreland and his cronies, as they often did with their imperialist insensitive inhumanity, did not keep their word and the Hmongs were bombed out of the Laotian highland home- they had always been mountain people. Well to make a long and gruesome story short, these proud people were exiled to the total alien, via squalid refugee camps, American Culture. One family ended up as neighbors of the aged Dirty Harry like character played by Eastwood in a bombed out Detroit, which was symbolically not all that dissimilar to the war ravaged Laos the Huongs were forced to leave.

We initially see the Eastwood character (Walt Kowalski, Kowalski was the name of the pre-eminent ""wrastler."" Killer Kowalsi, of the 1950's) left alone with his only contact being with his vulturistic, superficial children, and his memories of Korea and his recently deceased wife. Then the ""gooks"" (the Hmongs) moved next store. Initially Kawalski sees his Hmong neighbors as another assault on the world  of his past, when Detroit, Ford and GM were great. However, we slowly start to see similarities between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors, who both were exiles from an earlier more triumphant  time, and both were trying to hang on to their crumbling cultural identities. At first, Kowalski, in his usual hard ass (Eastwood) fashion rejects the friendly overtures of his neighbors, but soon he succumbs to their charm, honesty, innocence and authenticity. He becomes a protector and mentor to his neighbors and their children- particularly against the Hmong male gangs that were destroying their American born son. These conflicts were interspersed with moments of humor (e.g.,the thank you party for his protecting them). The transition comes full circle in the final scene when Kowalski doesn't ""bring his guns to town,"" with his hardened heart being opened by his encounters with his proud and humble neighbors. It certainly did, as Dirty Harry once said, ""make my day.""

This film can be viewed on many levels. It is a story of a man accepting change and diversity at an age when most people would prefer to dwell on their memories. On a more profound level, Gran Torino suggests the possibility of global unification, or at least respect, of diverse cultures and an unconditional acceptance of ""the other,"" no matter how different they seem on the surface. This was definitely the movie of the year. Moreover, in my opinion, this is Eastwood's most socially conscious and finest film; as Elvis Costello once sang, and this could have been part of the soundtrack ,""What's so funny bout peace, love, and understanding?""",1249689600,2,3601,4.943801652892562
7450982,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood is so often seen as just Dirty Harry that we often don't see that he is quietly become one of the best directors of the past 25 years.  Gran Torino is a touching and subtle film that evokes such basic human feelings that you can't help but pay full attention and become absorbed into it. The characters are so basically human that you can see them in so many different settings.

Among the most refreshing aspects of this is how Eastwood's character, an unabashed racist, SOB, doesn't really change so much as evolve. What we see originally as racism is really more a case of a fellow who believes in protecting one's own and that is exactly what he does here. Eastwood deserves credit for giving himself the candor, humor and humanity to play a real human being and not fall into a caricature.

7450998,5,B015S4DS1K,"I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.

Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.

Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.

Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.

Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits. Here, truly, is the man who has done it all.

Walt seemed to have a change of heart way too soon, did not seem like a natural progression. One minute he hates the Koreans and the next he is out to save them. It would have been nice if there was more of a transition. The ending, while admirable was very predictable to me. SPOILER ALERT. It was so obvious when Walt went to confession and only had those two simple sins to confess...nothing about any vigilante killings he was about to do...you just knew that he was not going to do anything bad/illegal etc. When he was standing outside the gang bangers residence just blabbing away (risking be shot at any second) I knew again that he had no intentions on shooting anyone otherwise he would have done it right away and not risked getting shot first. You can see him setting it all up, dragging it on for more witnesses to see etc. It was an ok movie and I like Clint but it sure did not live up to all of the hype I heard....

7451004,4,B015S4DS1K,"With both Asian and Polish ancestry and having grown up only an hour or so away from Detroit, I found watching ""Gran Torino"" a surreal experience.  Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence.  In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack.  (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Mickey Rourke in ""Year of the Dragon."")  Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.

But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, ""Gran Torino"" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones.  Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves.  Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians.  And his family is a bunch of jerks.  And he's dying, too.  If it sounds like I'm being too hard on ""Gran Torino,"" a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""  Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of ""Gran Torino"" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony.  But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars).  What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a ""gotcha"" you'll see coming from a mile away.

Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling ""Get off my lawn"" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.",1248998400,,3234,4.649122807017544
7451005,4,B015S4DS1K,"Walt is a foul-mouthed, bigotted, ex-autoworker, veteran of the Korean war. The movie starts with his wife's funeral. The funeral brings in Walt's estrangement with his family and grandchildren. Walt bemoans that his neighborhood is becoming non-white. What the movie does well is portraying how Walt is brought into a relationship with the Hmong family next door. The movies exposes the bigotry of Walt, but what Walt respects most is character. The kid next door is a doormat, but he show compassion for his neighbor. Tau's sister, is spunky and brave, and Walt learns to respect and like her. Walt gets pulled into their community because they need him and in turn he needs them. Food plays a key role in this movie like it does in most communities.

All the acting is superb. The movie is deadly serious, but there are some really funny scenes in the movie. Walt's relationship with his barber is hilarious. The relationship with the old lady next door is funny as well.

The continuing dialog between Walt and the persistent priest is very good. Walt dislikes the priest at first, but Walt starts to admire him for his intelligence and compassion.

This movie confronts bigotry far better than ""Crash"" and without all the heavy moralizing and coincidences. This movie gives its characters actual personalities and intelligence not just cariacatures.

Clint looks old in the movie, but he creates a very memorable character. The movie has very limited special effects, no flashbacks, and limited conversation.

7451018,3,B015S4DS1K,"I do not know if Clint is saying adieu in this movie or not.  I would tend to think that he is because most of his acting in it consists of trademark scowls, ""make my day"" confrontations and other stock Eastwood mannerisms. It some ways it is a parody of all his previous flicks. If Clint was to say ""good bye"" this movie does for him what the Shootist did for John Wayne.

The general features of the movie overlap the Shootist in several particulars:  both involve a crusty old guy with a violent past, both center on the relationship that develops between that guy and a young man whom he effectively teaches to be a man, both have the main character ill with a terminal disease (apparently in this movie) and both move toward the inevitable show down which the main character knows he will not survive.  This movie has a lot more street language.

Now, what I really like about this movie is its intentional, in your face celebration of masculine, pre-Political Correctness, pre-sensitivity, pre- just about everything else, grittiness.  Eastwood is making a statement here about what we lost when modern sensibilities have reduced male role models for young men to the artificial ""either-or"" of wimpish angst ridden pretty boys or mean, crotch-gripping gangstas.  There used to be more of a continuum in male-ness and Eastwood reminds us of an era when ""being a man"" had certain cultural connotations.  A man helps a little old lady when she spills her groceries getting them out of the car.  It also, as well, meantsnarling at a punk as you pushed a 357 magnum into his face in the act of rescuing a young woman that was otherwise an object of bigoted contempt.

So, compared to ""The Shootist"" this movie comes in a distant second but not without its own merit and value.  It's well worth watching even if some of the scenes are a bit forced (the Barbershop scene with the kid especially).",1248825600,3,1895,4.6437125748503
7451019,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino was a surprisingly emotional experience for me, both due to it being one of Eastwood's most affecting and human movies, and because my Dad loved Clint and we used to see all his films together. Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.

Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.

There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.

Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.

We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.

There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say ""colored guy"", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.

The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.

But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.

I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.

This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....

Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.",1248825600,4,5026,4.483060109289617

 As a life long Clint Eastwood fan watching ""Gran Torino"" stirred up memories of Dirty Harry, Sgt Gunney Highway from ""Heartbreak Ridge"" and any other similar characters that Clint has done throughout his illustrious career in his iconic, ""Eastwood"" style. A style complete with his trademark raspy voice, angry-eyed stares & straight to the point, but sometimes humourous dialouge.  Set in a Detroit neighborhood we learn that Eastwood's character Walt Kwolski has just become a widow. A decorated veteran of the Korean War he has two sons, but he isn't close to them nor their families. His grand-daughter talks to him about what is going to happen to his possessions when he is going to die. His son & daughter-in-law talks to him about going to a retirement home. He also hates the Toyota SUV his son is driving as we learn Walt used to work at the Ford factory. ""Buy American"" he curses! I'm not from Detroit, but I heard import cars are sometimes frowned upon there since American cars are produced by the big three American manufacturers in Detroit.

With the look of frustration he continues to live alone with his dog. He has immigrant neighbors that he initially despises, but ultimately gets drawn to them after a local gang encounter with the family's son Thao. The same son that attempts to steal Walt's prized 72 Gran Torino from Walt's garage but fails. Walt becomes a neighborhood hero and is showered with gifts of plants or food by his neighbors that he initially refuses. Thao's sister Sue, befriends Walt and he returns the favor by rescuing her from three men who threaten her & her very, scarred boyfriend. However the very shy & reclusive Thao becomes the interim student for Walt, as Walt sort of takes him under his wing and attempts to make him more of a man by teaching him. His dialogue lesson in the barber shop is one of the greatest and funniest moments in the film, which helps him immensely for his next encounter during the construction job interview. Walt still periodically communicates with his son's family with little or no success (his son's attempt to give his father birthday presents were funny to watch!), but it is the immigrant family that Walt really bonds with in this film as they are the true focal point for Walt. We also learn of Walt's impending sickness that may very well influence him for what he decides to do in the end.

This is a coming of age film for the character Thao and a redemption story for Walt who despite his severed relationship with his sons & their families finds solace with another family he initially despises but learns to trust & love towards the end. There are many racial slurs spoken throughout the film as well as profanity, but the kind of language you might hear from street gangs anyways. Actually, every time Eastwood spoke with profanity, he always made it sound funny! The film climaxes to the eventual final confrontation with Walt & the terrorizing gang. Without revealing what really happens in the end, the results were satisfactory. This is another great Eastwood film that goes up there with ""Unforgiven"" & ""Million Dollar Baby"". Although I think ""Gran Torino"" should satisfy more of the Eastwood fans that enjoyed the type of character Eastwood portrays from his Dirty Harry movie series or a similar character from ""Heartbreak Ridge"". Classic Eastwood at his best!

Oh yeah & the next time someone gets on my front yard, I will give them the iconic Eastwood stare & say ""Get Off my Lawn!"".",1248739200,4,3691,4.993495934959349

7451024,5,B015S4DS1K,"There are many things to like about Gran Torino. The thing I appreciate most is its authenticity. There is nothing in ""Gran Torino"" that makes you stop and say ""Now wait a minute - it wouldn't happen that way"". The story takes place in-or-near Detroit - and it is very obvious that it was filmed in the Detroit area.... again everything has a real authentic feal.

  The story is a coming-to-age story of a man in his ""senior"" years (I know that is a weird way to start an ""coming-to-age"" movie). Eastwood's character is recently widowed retired autoworker who is perpetually unhappy in his bigoted ways. Through a series of events he discovers that he has more respect for his new immigrant neighbors than he does for his own kids. I won't go into too many of the details - but nothing feels contrived or forced in terms of the plot development.

  ""Gran Torino"" is a multi-layered story tale on respect and redemption. The story is very tight and well-written with artistic qualities that are often seen in novels, but rarely in big-budget Hollywood films. While the story is not for everyone (definitely NOT for kids) I think that all of Eastwood's fans will be more than a little satisfied.

Final Verdict - ""Gran Torino"" is a great movie, and in many ways it the equal of ""Millionaire Baby"". While there are a couple of acting weak points (in my opinion the priest was the weakest) the whole story is excellent and highly recommended.

7451031,4,B015S4DS1K,"By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.

The first two were ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"".

What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?

Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.

The script for ""Gran Torino"", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.

The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.

But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.

Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.

To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.

I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...  The film certainly deserves deluxe treatment.",1248134400,,1398,4.695473251028806

7451033,5,B015S4DS1K,"I rarely write reviews; I just tend to read them and most are quite helpful. I'm writing this for two reasons: to comment on some of the negative ""reviews"" here and to share my thoughts and feelings about Gran Torino, which may be Clint Eastwood's last movie.

Last night it was late and I still wasn't tired at all, so I went to my DVD collection and Gran Torino practically jumped into my hands. I put it in and before I started to watch it (for the 6th time in the last 3 weeks), something told me to read the reviews at Amazon. After perusing through all 252 comments I was amazed at the people who gave negative reviews. The most used comment was ""wooden acting"".

My brother, who studied cinema and is a screenwriter, and I (and I studied film as well) talked about that very same comment that so-called professional critics leveled at the movie. We laughed at that because of two reasons: we grew up near a lot of Asian people and if they don't know you they are VERY withdrawn and may seem a bit... well, wooden. So Clint was being true to life with the portrayal of the Hmong people.

The other thing that made us laugh is that Clint Eastwood is meticulous and thorough when he does pre-prep for any movie, especially one he plans to direct and act in. His work ethic allows him to be spontaneous behind and in front of the camera. And the ""critics"" didn't even notice that he purposely shot this film with a grainy stock, almost to make it have the look of a student film or a documentary. He intended to give the look and feel of Gran Torino the same sense of immediacy and uncertainty Walt Kowalski feels. Why else start with a funeral, followed by the experience we the audience have of seeing him alone in a house filled with so-called family ?

We're intended to feel his unease and sense of aloneness as well. And at the same time, next door, a child is being blessed: death and aloneness at his house while new birth and renewal of life is just next door... although he doesn't know it at the time while we do.

One last note about the negative commentors: I noticed that they tended to be very short, like one sentence or two, whereas the people who liked/loved the movie wrote some really detailed comments on what the movie meant to them. Not one negative comment gave a detailed account of why they didn't like the movie. It seems they just got on the ""wooden acting"" bandwagon. Perhaps they may be relying on he ""crituque"" of so-called critics they'd either read or seen on TV.

I've been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford movies lately. I've just been really drawn to them. I feel that they had similar careers, in that that they were perceived at first as nothing more than pretty boys- eye candy for the box office. But they both were very serious about their craft and became very masterful along the way. Both learned the basics and became excellent actors, directors and story-tellers. And both have created some of the best American cinema since the 1970s.

What I love about both (for some reason they seem very much the same in that they let expression and subtleties express SO much more than words ever could) is that they are major stars and icons in our culture but they were mostly focused on their craft. So we have the benefit of a very rich legacy of cinema to learn from. And their movies are so fun to watch the lessons are effortlessly learned. Now that's magic, to me.

As a musician, writer and hopefully one day, a screenwriter as well, I cannot even think of a better place to start than with movies from Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. ""Less Is More"" is a sometimes over-used and misunderstood adage. With them, they make that saying sing like Maria Callas at her peak. They've taught me that economy can equal depth, as well as a VERY important thing: get the audience engaged and thinking. They've showed me, in movie after brilliant movie- just how much you can get from that simple yet difficult to master concept.

Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's summation of his career, his limning the interstices of his place as an icon in cinema and yet another treatise on the art of ""Less Is More"". I first saw it in the theatre, the first time in years I'd even had the desire to go see a movie. I was a bit shocked at the graininess of the film stock at first but then I understood what he was doing. Just like in Unforgiven he used shadow to express light, here he was using graininess to express the very refined craft of making a film. And, as I wrote earlier- that grain gives a sense of immediacy, almost as if he couldn't wait to say, ""Action !"" and roll film.

He sends up Dirty Harry (""Get OFF my lawn"") and the Outlaw Josey Wales (the first time he has that what turns out to be a spitting contest of sorts with the Hmong grandmother, who's spit is more potent than his, was hilarious). Those two characters redefined modern cinema. With Dirty Harry, an entire genre of movies wouldn't have been as rich as they became; The Outlaw Josey Wales brought the Western back to prominence in modern cinema.

While embodying these mythic characters on film he always knew his role in becoming an icon and understood the larger implications. So, while sending them up he also adds a great degree of pathos to Harry Callahan and Josey Wales. He's studying them along with us and adding more depth and richness to them. What a brilliant technique !

With Gran Torino we are watching a master seemingly effortlessly and quite playfully display his work for us to see just what it takes to make great art. And he gives a very eloquent summation of his iconic impact on modern cinema. And besides that- it's a great film. Popcorn, please !

This movie clearly shows he wasn't just a pretty boy. There was a great artist always inside.",1248134400,7,5794,4.4547169811320755

It is an action movie, but also touching in that it explores growing old, changes in society, honor, standing up to the ""bad guys"", and overcoming prejudice (from all sides). This movie has a lot of cursing, but it is in context with the gang culture and times, and some of the violence may bother some, although it has no more than most R-rated action movies out there, and once again, it is in context to the plot.

Walt hates the way his neighborhood has been taken over by African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. His new neighbours are Hmongs, mountain people from Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Walt unwillingly becomes the mentor of a young Asian teenager who lives next door. Walt rejects any act of kindness shown by his sons, and then and later is rejected by them in turn. Walt is all for justice, and when the shy boy he has been mentoring, and his sister are attacked, Walt is determined to even the score.

Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Playing the neighborhood crank (""Hey, get off my lawn""), in a neighborhood gradually changed around him; he is bigoted and ornery. Dealing with the death of his wife and the realization that all his neighbors are Hmong refugees, he is one angry old man. The problem is credibility. Eastwood's use of racial epithets doesn't seem to effect his neighbors one bit. Calling them every insult imaginable for a person of Eastern descent evokes smiles from the neighbors, except Grandma, who wastes no time telling him off. I thought I was watching ""Walter"", the Jeff Dunham character rather than Eastwood.

The gradual shift from hate to a point where Eastwood actually gives his life to save the neighbor's kid is a powerful story line, but lost in the stereotypical way Eastwood acts (or fails to). I just don't think this movie lived up to all the hype. On a minor note, the Gran Torino in the title and mentioned significantly in the trailers is barely a plot line in the movie. Yes, he did help assemble the car; yes, the neighbor did try and steal it, but other than sitting outside and polishing it occasionally, it is not central to the plot at all.

Once he gets past his initial prejudice regarding the family, he realises that they are just like any other family, with all their flaws, just like his own. He soon realises that they are victims of crime, trying to avoid the insidious grasp of brutal Detroit streetgangs.  He sees a situation that he can change and with a lot of guts, savvy and understanding is able to open everyones eyes.

The plot is not original. The cast are all unknowns, and the racism is rampant..

With that said....  I LOVED THIS FILM.

As many of you have already written, Clint Eastwood and crew deserve all the recognition and notoriety after creating this moving film..

My only critique would be the flagrant use of derogatory terms. But, in hindsight, it ultimately does build to the story of when they start becoming friends and the climax of the movie shifts towards Walt's act of redemption..

To me, this film is masterfully woven together.
You didn't know if he was going to die from the diagnosis he received,
or if he was plotting to go out with guns blazing (dirty harry now driving a gran torino...) Anyone can see from a mile away that he was planning on that night being his final breathe, but, I never would have imagined his selfless act of sacrifice.

Obviously, he's going to the house to seek vengeance for their actions.. But, in a way, I got the sense that his redemption from the korean war was to be killed by those gooks... almost an eye for an eye kind of thing..

But at any rate, those are just some of MY interpretations of the film.

7451081,5,B015S4DS1K,"As a longtime Clint Eastwood fan, I've watched this movie numerous times since I bought it, and it's astonishing that a man almost 80 years old can make a movie THIS good.

I know people not even 50 years old laid up sick on dialysis, and Eastwood not only made a movie of this depth and direction, but also STARRED in it, which is amazing to me.

No person in film history has starred and directed themselves in as many movies as he has.

He's one of a kind.

Having said that, unless they plan on bringing out another edition of the movie, the special features were lacking.

Just a couple of features about cars.

Strange, when you consider that the car is only peripheral to the real plot of the movie.

Virtually nothing on the origins of the project, and how the film came to fruition. No behind the scenes visions as the film was being made. Not even the movie trailer is included.

But, my five stars are for the the film ITSELF, which is a testament to Eastwood's indelible career.

It's a travesty that this movie not only didn't WIN any major awards, it virtually wasn't even nominated for ANYTHING.

One nomination from the Golden Globes and NOTHING from the Academy.

Ridiculous.",1247270400,6,1192,4.497674418604651

Not that I'm in favor of gangs ruling neighborhoods, but let's face it - an army of crusty old white guys with bad prostates and bladder issues running around with guns in old 70's vehicles isn't the solution!

7451098,5,B015S4DS1K,"I usually am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood or the movies he makes and that's why I waited so long to see this one.  That was until I started hearing EVERYONE saying how great it was.  From my little sister to my elderly grandfather and all in between...they all said it was one of the better movies they have ever seen.  With the credits on the screen now rolling, I agree.  It's one of the finer movies I've seen at least this year.

The only thing I would tell people going into it is beware of racism.  Pretty much any and all racial slurs are used in this movie.  It didn't bother me because that's how it is.

Also a special spot in my heart is that this was in part filmed in and near Detroit, where I live.

If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor, shell out the money to buy it and do just that....buy it.  Watch it, love it.  You won't be disappointed!",1247184000,4,875,4.058479532163743
7451099,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is a movie of redemption. Well...perhaps not in the way you think. This is supposedly Eastwood's last movie as far as acting, or so I've heard. He plays a retired auto worker who's bitter at the world a.k.a. Hollywood's latest attempt at portraying the Grumpy Old Man, but this time it's nothing to laugh at. Here you have a man who fought in Korea, and is prejudiced against all Asians. He for the most part doesn't have anything nice to say about anyone. This all changes one night when his prized possession a 1972 Gran Torino is almost stolen by a teenage Asian boy as a initiation to join a gang. Well it backfires, and the boy is almost killed by Walt(Eastwood's character). It's at this point that Walt's and the boy Tao's paths cross as Tao's family makes him go over to apologize to Walt, and offers Tao to help out Walt. Walt's heart is softened somewhat, and he becomes friendly with Tao's family, and breaks bread with them. He also protects them well the big sister as the gangs in Detroit where Walt lives take a shine to her....Not. Anyway Walt takes Tao under his wing(In his own way), and helps him to come out of his shell. Then the real test comes when Tao's sister is assaulted, and Walt takes matters into his own hands so to speak. Surprisingly he does it up as a way to pay back the Asians he murdered in war while in Korea. He goes out, and gets a fitted suit, makes amendments to his will, and does something his dead wife wanted him to do, and that was to make confession of all his sins. He confronts the teenage Asians with the assumption to kill them all, but imagine that he allows the gang to kill him. This is redemption in action which is how I guess some men try to make amends for not showing love to one another because of male pride, and so forth. Tao in fact gets the closest to an apology from Walt as Tao assumes that he's going along with Walt to confront the gang, and Walt tells Tao that he (Walt) has blood on his hands, and that he doesn't want that for Tao. Not to mention that to the surprise of his family...especially his eldest granddaughter that the Gran Torino goes to Tao. This was a decent outing for Eastwood, but not quite the classics of ""Play Misty For Me"", or ""Heartbreak Ridge"". This movie did speak to me however as the scene where Tao goes into the barber shop with Walt, and Walt starts spewing slurs left and right, and then Tao trying to emulate Walt does the same thing, but ends up insulting the guy. This is where we as men have to be careful because we as children want to be modeled after our fathers. I know that one time I heard my father slur a race, and when I said something similar I was told to:""Shut Up."" I still don't understand if he didn't want me to utter the slur then why did he do it in front of me? This is not a movie for those who are offended by racial slurs, and downright raunchy language. However, Eastwood should've recieved the Best Actor award for his portrayal of Walt.",1247097600,3,2970,4.286476868327402

Being Eastwood's last starring role in a film, he did a magnificent job at creating a believable character.

7451102,5,B015S4DS1K,"A local talk show host here in Bakersfield (Ralph Bailey), who happens to be an African American, and a moderate conservative, often says something to the affect of ""Folks born before WWII get a pass for saying ""knucklehead"" racial epitaphs because they lived through the era of segregation an the Civil Rights movement. However, those of us born in or after the ""Baby Boom"" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like ""All in the Family"", and ""Sanford & Son"" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.

""Gran Torino"" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.

But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.

In ""Gran Torino"", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the ""Unforgiven"", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.

One of the best films I've seen in a while!

5*

Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile. My first car was a '73 Gran Torino, so if anyone should have liked what they did, it might have been me, but I seldom watch DVD extras, and I still think they missed a great chance to do some more good with this excellent movie.",1247011200,5,2514,4.526431718061674

7451107,4,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwoods' post production period on ""Changeling"" (2008) is when he apparently found the time to craft ""Gran Torino"". Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like ""Changeling"", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.

As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.

The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.

Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).

""Gran Torino"" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.

This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them. For the record, this also marks the debut of Clint Eastwoods' youngest child, a 21 year old actor. Try to find out where he features - its one of the standouts of the entire film for many reasons.

7451114,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is so brazenly anti-p.c. that I am surprised it was even made.  The movie shows the reality of gang warfare and the futility of trying to stand up to these thugs.

Eastwood's character takes on the young boy ""Toad"" and teaches him important lessons.  The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to ""Get off my lawn!"".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.

7451127,4,B015S4DS1K,"If, as I've heard rumored, Gran Torino turns out to mark Clint Eastwood's final film role, he'll at least have gone out with another memorable performance to add to his long list.  Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.

The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.

It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.

While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own way in an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.

Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.",1246492800,3,5546,4.871413390010627

It seemed as though the movie was going to be predictable when it started and in some ways it was, but there were enough twists and turns in the plot that the way it ended was not what I expected.  His character, Walt's, Detroit neighborhood is changing along with the world and he isn't.  I winced at some of the politically incorrect humor and remarks that came out of his mouth, but felt a sadness for him, being all alone in the world after his wife's death an his sons being emotionally distant and involved in their own lives.

Nonetheless, Walt was portrayed as a strong man in spite of his age and his points of view.  He is a likable character even though at the beginning of the movie none of the main characters like each other.  As the movie goes on you begin to see a building of respect and understanding among them.

7451159,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood is probally the only man in his late seventies that could probally kick your arse. Let's face it. He's still a force to be reckoned with.
One of cinema's greatest Tough Guy actors and the heir apparent to the mantle of the late John Wayne, Eastwood has carved a unique niche in cinema history.

This film almost plays like an updating of the character he portayed as Dirty Harry Callahan in the 70s. A tough, hard edged man who was politically incorrect and did morally questionable things but seemed to always get the job done ,whatever that may be.
His character is a war veteran who has just lost his wife. Besides still mourning demons of his violent past he must contend with severe loneliness brought on not just by the loss of his wife but by family alienation. His two sons seem to have no love for him and only use him. His grandkids, ditto. He has several predjudiced reservations about his own neighborhood as several Chinese immigrants move in that recall in his mind the enemy that he had fought and had warped his soul so much.
To make matters worse, his street is surrounded by violent gangs that wreak mayhem for no discernible purpose. The cousin of one of the local gangsters has moved in to him next door. He's a young and shy kid who through fear and peer preasure is forced into attempting to steal Eastwood's Gran Torino car. The kid instead faces the barrel of Eastwood's M1 rifle!

Interestingly, this is really where the film begins. Eastwood unintentionally becomes connnected to the family next door and learns something of there culture and is looked upon as a hero. The young man is ordered to work for him to erase his debt from the attempted theft and he becomes mentored by Eastwood. In many ways, Eastwood has discovered the family he never had. Unfortunately, his world is being threatened by escalating violence and this leads to a powerful resolution and the defintion of true heroism.

Eastwood has always been known for making complex and interesting films and this one is no different. It's a surprisingly fast paced and short Drama that nonetheless remains more touching and memorable that virtually most films released today. It's a film that questions not just the concept of a hero but the concept of how and why we need them. It also is one of the few films to offer such biting commentary on the general apathy of today's generations with it's lack of morales and petty materialism. This is certainly NOT a Hollywood picture.

Clint's acting is just abput as good as it gets. Only an actor of Eastwood's level of charisma could make such a racist and mean spirited character so loveable and funny. Eastwood's confrontations with the gangs throughout the picture are certainly highlights and are as fun as we'd expect. The film also offers Clint an opputunity to reflect on the right of violence, sort of like his Will Munny in 1992's ""Unforgiven"". His confession to a young Priest in the film and his ultimate sin and life regret is one of the actor's great screen moments and sums up the message of the film beautifully.

Eastwood is supported by a fine cast including newcomer Bee Vang as ""Tao"", the youth who attempted to steal Clint's Gran Torino who becomes very much like his ""lost son"". His scenes with Clint are both humorous and moving. Christopher Carley's role as an insisitent young Priest also hist the right note and he plays off of Eastwood surprisngly well. Ahney Her is cute and likeable as the older sister of Tao and she is able to be one of the few people whos is able to empathize with Eastwood's cantankerous character.

This film is overall incredibly well directed and acted while remaining consistently entertaining. First rate cinema all the way and a perfect bookend to the career of one of America's most significant artists. Truly great and one of the best films of this decade.",1246060800,4,3867,4.696165191740413
7451160,4,B015S4DS1K,"I have enjoyed most all of Clint Eastwood's movies whether he's the actor, director, or writer.  He is, with Woody Allen, one of the two best contemporary American directors.  He is also the John Wayne of our times.  Eastwood gets credit for exploring the soul (and the society the poor soul lives in) in a manner that leaves us with a lot to think about.  In ""Gran Torino"" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.

The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that ""changed"" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.

Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.

I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating ""Gran Torino"" against other recent Eastwood pictures.  It's not a ""family picture"" but it is certainly worth seeing.",1246060800,2,2229,4.552763819095477

7451163,5,B015S4DS1K,"I saw this film alone in the theatre, as my wife is Asian, and having seen the reviews, I figured that the dialog and language would be somewhat sensitive and racially charged. I was definitely correct in that conclusion. My father turns 80 this year and easily could have played the role of Walt, a man who has never quite understood the concept of political correctness, or the need to welcome people who his own generation has seen war against.

I can also attest to the spot-on accuracy of the portrayal of the Hmong family. The neighbor matriarch, the family party and the changing roles between the older and younger generations are all shown with absolute clarity. I have been to the exact types of gatherings that Walt was invited to, and the film portrays it superlatively.

I can also appreciate that Eastwood can go beyond the role of Dirty Harry. I am one who believes that Clint is at his best in his deeper, more reflective roles. Think ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" rather than ""Sudden Impact"". It is good to see that in the twilight of his career, Eastwood can still show his range.

The ending will not be for everyone, but I think no great movie will be. I think this is a film that will best be appreciated by anyone who has asked the hard questions of life relating to ""What's next?""...the questions that have no clear answer, other than the seeking of redemption and atonement, and the desire to do for others that which they cannot do for themselves. Not a bad way to wrap things in life up, in my opinion.",1245888000,2,1537,4.541516245487364

7451165,3,B015S4DS1K,"This is an enjoyable movie, but you must be willing to suspend logic in many places, starting with the premise of the movie - that a local gang is so determined to get this kid to join them that they will do anything. Sure, he is the cousin of one of them, but he is also a wussy young kid. Why on earth would they want him hanging around? Heck, even if wanted to get in the car, it was already full. Whose lap did they want him to sit on?

Then no matter what Walt/Eastwood does to the local thugs, from mouthing off to pulling guns on them to beating them up, the thugs never come after HIM.

And when Walt gets to the porch with his gun in time to witness the drive-by shooting, he not only does not shoot at the bad guys, but he does not identify them to the police. Likewise, the girl who gets beat up does not identify them. Yes, it's been established that Walt doesn't believe in letting the cops handle trouble for him, but then ultimately, [SPOILER:] he leaves the fate of the gang in the hands of the police and the legal system instead of taking care of them himself. With any kind of lawyer, the thugs will not spend a day in jail. Walt was on their property, making threats, and as all the witnesses (who are suddenly willing to talk to the police) will testify, he made a fast motion as if going for a gun. If Walt was willing to die, a more Eastwood-esque ending of going in guns blazing would have made a LOT more sense.

On the plus side, the casting was perfect. Sadly, the self-absorbed, greedy relatives were spot-on. However, a final directing flaw was the WAY too-long pause to build ""suspense"" during the reading of the will (""and the car goes to..................."") while the camera focused on the grinning, greedy granddaughter.

He also looks great for being almost 80.
The film has a great storyline. Its about an angry old man named walt who just lost his wife and no one cares that he lost his wife, The grandkids make a mockery of his wife's funeral and his son's just shrug it off and kind of think its puzzling that he is so mad at them.
He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.
So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.

This movie shows all that is good about people who are no-nonsense, get-to-the-point, and believe that being politically correct is crap. Eastwood plays this part brilliantly when he portrays Walt Kowalski, an old Korean War veteran who is greatly misunderstood and taken for granted by his family. He eventually befriends an Asian boy named Tao and mentors him on the finer points in being a man. He also looks out for Tao's sister Su and their family that live next door to him. Kowalski stands up against gangs that hang frequently in the neighborhood, and grows very close to Tao and his family. He sees the differences in his family and Tao's and sees the shallow and fake concern of his own family contrasted with the warm, inviting comraderie of Tao's family. Granted, there is a lot of swearing and some violence in this movie, so would not be appropriate for children. However, it seems to fit into this type of movie.

7451183,5,B015S4DS1K,"As a retired Marine, I've met my fair share of characters like Walt Kowalski, convincingly represented  in this movie by Clint Eastwood.
I have to say he did an incredible job of being this individual, considering I've just co-authored a book with Betty Dravis who actually interviewed Clint Eastwood and her recollection of him is nothing like the character he portrays.

There are a variety of things this movie addresses and I wasn't honestly prepared for it to be as good as it is.

In addition to Clint's realistic performance, I was especially touched by the feisty ""sister"" of the character Walt begrudgingly begins to like. She not only holds her own, but then some!  The brother character took a while to grow on me but grow he did, and the one gang member (can't recall his name) who ""flipped Walt off"" was also very convincing.  My oldest son and I both laughed at the things he said because his character reminded us--and I imagine will remind a lot of people--of people like that, that they know or have known.

I've been a fan of Clint for years now, and it isn't a matter of whether he still has IT! He definitely does!  This movie is a MUST SEE and an eye-opener for those that aren't aware of this very real world.

This movie couldn't be more aptly named because of all the people on the planet, (and having traveled a bit of it), I would have to say that Americans have the most ""mad love"" for cars!

The barber is also an integral part of making this movie work, but you'll have to see it to see why I say that.

Last, I watched this by myself because no one was home at the time I bought it, then again with my wife and son, and I have to say, it was even better, the second time around because there were subtle things that got by me the first time. I enjoyed it much the first time, as well! It's the kind of movie I'll watch many times through the years.

7451184,5,B015S4DS1K,"My last name is a long Polish word which translates into ""parsley"" in English.  Eastwood's acting and directing is flawless.  Walt Kowalski, as Clint portrays him, reflects quite accurately just what my father's and uncles' (old-fashioned) Polish characters were very much like. We also had Italian in-laws in the family... and the exchange of verbiage, during family get-togethers, was a lot like that which occurred between Walt and his barber in the movie.
  The movie does reveal a marvelous fluidity of Walt's character; Walt does drop much of his ingrained structures of prejudice, at times... and this change from prejudice to compassion is very bright and sunny.  Humanity can change from rigid perspectives to more insightful and compassionate intelligence.
  As an aging man, I could relate to Walt's sagacious reflections and physical ailments and problems.  My favorite philosopher, J.Krishnamurti (who lived part of each year in Ojai, California), when he was alive, was very appreciative of many of Clint's films; Krishnamurti died at the age of 91.

I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in.  When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one.  Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling.  I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.

Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him.  When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him.  Through this they become friends.  Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant.  Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.

The movie is about the car but isn't.  Everyone wants that car, but only the one deserving will get it in the end.  My mother warned me the ending was not what I'd expect and boy was she right.  I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about.  I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.

This was an excellent movie, you must watch and own.  Truly an Eastwood best.  Imagine Dirty Harry old and meaner and you have Walt.

7451196,5,B015S4DS1K,"We all have gotten to know Clint Eastwood through his handiwork.  The countless early Western TV shows and movies he starred in introduced him to us.  His role changed from Star to Superstar in his epic depictions of ""Dirty Harry,"" the hard boiled Inspector of Homicide.  Since those days, we have seen his excellence as a director in many more excellent dramas and Westerns.

Although controversial, we peered into his morality and sense of caring above and beyond the cultural senses of morality in Million Dollar Baby.

And now, at the age where you would think that Dirty Harry would be merely lolling in retirement, drinking his beer and smoking his cigarettes on a front porch, Clint Eastwood directs and stars in a movie where he IS in retirement drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the front porch, snarling at everyone, his neighbors, his war experiences, and his own family!

In Gran Torino, he shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks.  Ever steeped in hatreds, bigotries and racial stereotyping, he is slowly changed by his Hmong immigrant neighbors.  As he takes a young teenage Hmong under his wing (although in the beginning it was done to protect the only thing he truly loves, his vintage, mint condition 1972 Gran Torino,) he steers young Thao away from the aimless Gang-bangers and ""Mans"" Thao up.  (Accordingly to his learned, inherited flawed standards.)  While doing so, he discovers that on the human emotional side, he truly has a lot more in common with the Immigrant Ethics than he has with his own kin!

As ""Walt"" softens and learns to appreciate the Immigrant's generosity and hospitality, we see the true heart of our ""Dirty Harry.""  He has more purpose in life now than just hating everyone and loving his Gran Torino.  When young Thao is ""man enough"" to go on a date, Walt even lets the young man (who preciously tried to steal his True Love) use his Gran Torino to take the young girl out on a date in style!

And when the neighborhood gang threaten and try to kill the immigrant family, Walt lets out the Dirty Harry in himself, and sacrifices himself to protect the people who have adopted the ""crusty old bastard"" as one of them!

Walt's last request was to give Thao his Gran Torino.  In the last scene when we see Thao driving Walt's old Gran Torino, the car with the grille that scowled like Walt used to do, the joy on Thao's face reveals that not only is Thao driving Walt's soul. but Walt's soul has been transplanted in young Thao!

If anything that Clint Eastwood has done in this movie that is worthwhile is this:  To show how, in a changing America, that by embracing and celebrating the diversity in this country we all strengthen what this country is all about in the first place!

7451197,3,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" begins with a grim, crusty, bigoted Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) who has just become a widower. Living with him must have been an act of penance for his devoutly Catholic wife. A very persistent boyish-looking priest in his late twenties has promised Clint's wife that he'll get the old codger to confession.
He has two sons and some grandkids who are self-centered, mean, and hateful, but they are also rubrics rather than real people. With a patriarch like Eastwood, it's little wonder they turned out so nasty.
He lives in a well-kept single family home in a nice neighborhood that's been taken over by Southeast Asians (Hmongs). Clint's prize possessions are an antique Ford Gran Torino (he worked on the Ford Detroit assembly line for many years) and an M-1 rifle from his service in Korea.
Over the years Eastwood's voice has grown hoarser, more gravelly, more strained and harder to distinguish. He's a dinosaur of the American film industry but still a national treasure.
The plot is formulaic, melodramatic and predictable. Eastwood is gradually won over by his Asian neighbors, especially the son and daughter next door. He becomes a mentor for the son and has to prevent the boy from becoming prey for the local Asian gang. Eastwood at first resorts to his guns with vestiges of his Dirty Harry image coming to the fore.
Eastwood has perfected a screen persona that is difficult for him to step out of. Even his walk is iconic. It probably would be better for him to let someone else direct a picture like this so it wouldn't turn into a star vehicle.
The ending is a surprise in a movie that needs a jolt of originality. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.",1245456000,,1697,4.717171717171717

7451200,5,B015S4DS1K,"With 175 reviews to read you probably won't get around to reading mine. But Gran Torino may just be Clint Eastwood's finest acting, and it certainly one of the best films he's directed. It's both iconic - building on Dirty Harry and Unforgiven - and subtle. As an actor friend of mine once said back in the late 1970's about Clint: ""He's got one look. But boy, is it a good look.""

Gran Torino is the embodiment of that statement. When Clint levels his rifle at the scum, and says he could blow their heads off, go in, and sleep like a baby, he's probably the only man on earth you'd believe saying something like that. His eyes, his carriage, his intensity.

Underneath that patented Dirty Harry glare is a performance of such subtlety, minute inflections, and being it's virtuoso. He's like a worn out pair of jeans, a well-oiled and used baseball mitt. Clint Eastwood uses his entire body of work as a back drop to this performance, and builds on it to take us along for the ride.

I'm not going to share the plot as others have so far. It's a film about values and tradition. About accountability. Doing the right thing - up to and including making sure his old dog is taken care of. What's masterful about the film is that he takes what could have been a caricature in the hands of another actor and director and makes it believable.

Much has been made of his racist language. At first it's jarring. It's so all encompasing and over the top in the beginning of the film you can't help but concentrate on it. But he takes it from Archie Bunker territory with character development and plot arc to the point where you no longer actually hear the stupid words. You are too focused on the man's character and who he really is. A real racist would never have entered his neighbor's home, and certainly wouldn't have eaten their food. The reviewer who said he's racist because he doesn't know any other way to be is spot-on.

The Hmong cast is outstanding. I especially loved the interaction between Walt and Grandma - two peas in a pod. Bee Vang as Tow was solid as the boy who becomes a man. Ahney Her as Sue is the driver of the changes in Walt. If she couldn't hold her own with Clint the film wouldn't have worked. She does, and in the bargain, Gran Torino is a very satisfying, impressive film.

He directed Angelina Jolie to an Oscar nomination in Changeling (Universal; $29.98), the period film about a mother whose son has gone missing, only to find the corrupt LA police have tried to settle media hysteria by saddling her with another little boy and claiming this strange kid is in fact her child. Then Clint directed and starred in Gran Torino, a modest movie about a cranky old racist who finds he has more in common with his ""foreign"" neighbors than his own children. Remarkably, this tiny film has become the biggest hit of Eastwood's career as both an actor and director, with box office at $139 in the US. Yes, the year would have been perfect if Eastwood could have gone to the Oscars and crooned ""Gran Torino,"" the theme song he wrote and performed with Jamie Cullum. I'm not a fan of either movie, unfortunately. Changeling is still-born. Jolie has a fee good scenes when she has to deal with the seeming imposter that the police have forced her to take home. But John Malcovich is miscast as a crusading preacher who wants to help her, fight the cops and loves the spotlight. He seems so slippery I kept waiting for him to betray her in some way. And what is the film about? Corruption? It spends too much time with Jolie. A mother fighting for her child? We can't quite figure out why she takes this kid in, however few rights women had at the time. And then it veers off into serial killer territory, making the film seem like three unsatisfying movies in one. All it made me want to do was rewatch LA Confidential. Gran Torino doesn't have half the ambition of Changeling but isn't even half as (un)interesting. Clint growls so much throughout the film he almost seems to be parodying himself. And most of the unknown actors he is surrounded with simply aren't up to the task. Why this particular film should resonate with audiences is a mystery (his biggest hit adjusted for inflation is the godawful Every Which Way But Loose). But clearly Clint has hit icon status -- if Clint wants to make a movie about a cranky old man sitting alone on a porch, Warner Bros. would be foolish to say no. And hearing Clint speak-sing parts of the song ""Gran Torino"" sent me back to one of his less-appreciated gems, Honkeytonk Man, the moving story of a dying country and western singer who gets one final chance to record some music. That's not in Clint Eastwood: American Icon Collection ($19.98; Universal), but four offbeat films are -- and at a bargain price. You get Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me, which made a respectable $10 million back in 1971 but which Clint told David Letterman he remembers as a box office flop which might have been his only time directing if the French hadn't championed it. You also get the so-so action film The Eiger Sanction, the fun Coogan's Bluff (which turned into the hit TV series McCloud and the very atypical Civil War flick The Beguiled, which has wounded Clint recuperating at an all girl's school. It's slowly paced and I hated it when I was a little boy in the hospital and that was the only thing on TV, but it has its fans and it's about time I gave it another shot.

7451204,5,B015S4DS1K,"It's been interesting to observe the evolution of ""Clint Eastwood"" over the years. Some of us remember him as far back as his ""Rawhide"" days, and journeyed with him during his ""Spaghetti Western"" and ""Dirty Harry"" eras. Eastwood's company, ""Malpaso"" was formed in the late 60s and ""Malpaso Productions"" in the late 70s. It's from that era on, I've developed a true admiration of his work and that brings us to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001KVZ6F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)</a>

It's important to say upfront that ""Gran Torino"" is not about the car - only what it symbolizes. ""Gran Torino"" is not an easy story and Walt Kowalski (played, directed, and produced by Eastwood) is not an easy or necessarily likeable man. In some ways, the character much reminded me of Al Pacino's ""Lt. Col. Frank Slade"" in ""Scent of a Woman."" The words ""curmudgeon,"" ""obtuse,"" ""hard-boiled,"" and ""bigoted"" are just some of the descriptives. Kowalski has just lost his wife, is ill, is not happy with his life, with the world, his own neighborhood, or himself.

Kowalski is especially vexed by his next door neighbors - who are ""Hmong"" immigrants, and a young priest (played by Christopher Carley) who is bent on watching over Kowalski. The priest, who looks ten minutes older than a middle school student, means well, but thinks he has invented the answers to life. At least, at the beginning.

Then we add local gangs and their machinations into the mix and Kowalski finds himself in the position of defending his Asian neighbors. He is still resistant to friendship, but gradually the young boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) get under his skin.

It may be a cliche', but this is a ""coming of age"" story for many of the characters - including Kowalski when he makes an irrevocably final sacrifice in defense of the Asian family. Kowalski, in his own way, grew with one giant leap of selflessness.

Like much of real life, this is a pretty tough story to take, but it leaves us with a sense of hope and the potentiality that people can change.",1245369600,4,2157,5.09915014164306
7451205,5,B015S4DS1K,"Man, its just hard not to like Eastwood films!!  Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.

This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging.  It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today.  Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.

Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs.  For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes.  He is also in a vulnerable place.  He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood.  He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.

Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, he eventually ""modifies"" his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.

The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski -  this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying.  Clint was just wonderful as Kowalski and the actors portraying Sue and Thao were equally impressive.

This one, I'm sure I'll watch over and over again. I hiiiiiiighly recommend.",1245369600,4,1808,5.043771043771044
7451216,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is a movie that is more about redemption than about sheer race issues.  Kowalski lives in a run down part of Detroit, where he is a retired auto worker and Korean War Veteran.  He is a surly old man who despises everything and seemingly everyone.  His nieghborhood is totally Hmong with the only exception being him.

We view him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you have seen in the trailers, his dealings with the local youths.  He starts a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors who he builds an affinity for.  Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spews racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence.  He is a bit of a loaner, especially since he became a widower, but he enjoys his car and his home and wishes his world had not changed so much.

Kowalski calls everyone names, to their faces and he really does not care what type of rise it gets out of people.  He basically offends evryone, whites, blacks, hispanics, asians.  But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethic perspectives and their own racism.

Thao and Sue are like those you hear of in the news, the kids who have trouble come upon them, simply because they live in these areas.  Kowalski gets to know the Hmong, and they him.  He defends his home, his property and his friends.

Realism although surreal, has our senses impacted when you see the results of fighting.  At times, it leads to more of the same.  Kowalski, though is a figure of redemption, he impacts everyone who knows him eventually, yet the most impact is on the viewer of Gran Torino.

The extras in the DVD are good, more about cars than about society.  Wish there was more on the inner city and gang problems in this to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars.",1245283200,5,1776,4.531446540880503
7451217,5,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood has been a marvelous filmmaker throughout his entire career, and he continues to amaze us with his range and deep artistry.  He has also one of the most prolific filmmakers around, and in 2008 he made two features.  Whereas many directors in Hollywood can take years between films, Clint cranks them out with ease.  He's done this a lot in his career (1997, 1975 for instance), and here, the two films, Changeling and Gran Torino, are excellent.

Gran Torino is the better of Clint's 2008 films.

This may turn out to be one of my favorite Clint movies, as it's a real surprise of a film.  It's funny, sad, tragic, uplifting, and fascinating, and Clint packs it all into a running time of two hours (it's shorter than most of his other films, which usually hit the 140 minute mark). Clint gives one of his most memorable performances as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in the Midwest who is a racist.  Through circumstance, he befriends one of his neighbors, a Hmong teenager, and helps him through his life, leading to a stunning conclusion, one of the most surprising and moving in all of Clint's work.

This is one of Clint's most surprising films, funny and tender, filled with great cimenatography, funny dialogue (much of which is very un-PC, but it totally fits the story), intelligent situations, and, for the most part, excellent performances.  The two lead Hmong actors overact on occasion, but all of the other performances are first rate. The film is also very respectful of the Hmong culture itself, and I myself knew nothing about it until this film.  This film is also the biggest box office hit of Eastwood's career, which is really wonderful and a bit startling, if you think about it.  When I saw it in the theater, the show had sold out!  I can't remember the last time that happened (lucky for me, the theater added another show an hour later, so I didn't have to wait too long).  It reminds me of when Bob Dylan's Modern Times hit #1 a couple of years ago (and his recent album, Together Through Life, hit #1 as well).  Years ago who would have guessed that Eastwood would have a #1 hit in 2009, especially when you consider most, if not all, his contemporaries are playing caricatures of themselves, are doing mediocre supporting roles, or rehashing old roles.

It was a crime that Eastwood didn't get major Oscar nominations for this film (or Changeling, except for Jolie).  I have always wondered what goes through the mind of Academy voters when they nominate and award mediocre films (like this year's Slumdog Millionare, a decent film but hardly a great motion picture), and shut out much more thought provoking, challenging, and entertaining films like Gran Torino.  This film has been compared to Paul Haggis's Crash, but in a way that shows Gran Torino is the far superior film about race relations.  Crash is a bloated, self important, and preachy film.  Most people agree that Gran Torino manages to say more about race relations and tolerance than the ridiculously PC, overblown film Crash (ironically enough, Paul Haggis wrote several films for Clint Eastwood, all of which are better than Crash).  Methinks that the Academy is jealous of Clint, in that he's first an artist, and a celebrity second, and he just makes great films.  He should have gotten something for this film.

Eastwood keeps surprising us and himself, making excellent picture after excellent picture.  His last six films, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino, have been a remarkable run, and I can't wait for the next Clint Eastwood film.",1245283200,2,3641,4.799679487179487

The need we have to reign in our vengeance and our violence is acute.  The need we have to support each other while our jobs are being sold and destroyed is acute.

Hello you rude little brat, ever think about someone other than yourself, especially on the day his wife is being buried? Just a thought. The youth in this are generally portrayed as ignorant, smug, disrespectful, self-important, abusive and vulgar...so Walt (Eastwood) decides to give it right back. I will say this, the infamous line of ""get off my lawn"" while baring down on the local gang members with a rifle is possibly one of the most memorable moments you'll recall once you see it...because in each of us there is moment, even when a tiny thing has pushed us, where we could go over the edge and after years of it Walt does...and literally says, whatever he pleases regardless of consequence. It's worth owning and watching...Perhaps I did expect a different ending, but the movie is, in whole, going to be equally kin in talent to Eastwood's classics.",1245283200,4,1719,4.993031358885017

The film opens with two clashing cultural rituals--the church burial of Kowalski's wife, and the strange Hmong customs that welcome a new baby. The film ends with another funeral that we never expect, this one the result of a deliberately redemptive act. Early on we surmise that the gruff and grumbly Kowalski will be won over by his Hmong neighbors.

Walt Kowalski(Eastwood) is a retired Ford worker who can be best described as grizzled, profane, and just a little bit Archie Bunker-ish in his worldview.  Not the least bit misanthropic he feels more of a connection to his '72 Gran Torino than he does his own family.  Dig a little deeper, though, you find a man bearing the scars of his service in the Korean conflict.  Walt has an ingrained perception of the American dream but finds that being challenged by the changing face of his Detroit neighborhood particularly his reaction to the Hmong family who live next door to him.  Through a series of events, though, Walt developes a connection daresay a deep-rooted respect for the Hmong. Walt also feels, even in his dotage, the obligation to serve as protector to this family in an ever increasing hostile environment.  I harken back to ""Unforgiven"" when Eastwood re-evaluated his Western persona.  Here, Eastwood does a re-examination of his more reactionary film characters.  This film was cleverly advertised by it's makers as a geriatric action extravaganza.  For sure justice is meted out in the end but not remotely in a way you would think.  This film definitely stands out in the canon of Eastwood's illustrious career.",1245196800,4,1416,4.961864406779661
7451247,4,B015S4DS1K,"While I have been a fan of many of Clint Eastwood's movies for decades, GRAN TORINO seems to be one of his weaker films. Although its overall story arc of a bigot's change for the better (which permits him to perform a redemptive act) is genuinely moving and although there are at least a dozen excellent scenes (some touching, some humorous) showing him interacting with a pair of young Hmong neighbors (a brother and sister duo), this film also struck me as having lots of weak, flabby passages in its script.  Many repetitious and implausible scenes involving a stereotypically wet-behind-the-ears priest, an array of moronic, inept gang members, and the excessively obnoxious grandchildren of Eastwood's character should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. Similarly, many contrasting scenes affirming the overall wonderfulness of the refugee families are excessive and equally implausible.

Many DVDs contain ""deleted scenes"" with a director's commentary explaining why they were cut. This DVD has no such extra feature; instead, it appears that everything scripted was filmed, and everything filmed was included--which is unfortunate.

As a grumpy-old-racist-with-a-heart-of-gold, C.E. does a good job, and the issue of RACISM IN AMERICA is dealt with in a way that will (or should) make many viewers reconsider their own mindsets. I just wish the script and/or the final editing had been 20-to-30% better.

If you get offended by distasteful racial comments then this is a warning because you'll hear it from beginning of movie to the end and he didn't miss hardly any race or nationality. Highly recommend this movie.,1245196800,3,369,4.522388059701493
7451249,5,B015S4DS1K,"I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadoreos rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.

Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he ""disowned"" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of ""our"" fathers' generation(s).

The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.

But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made ""dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.

Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from ""not bad"" to ""well, I've seen worse."" Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity. I wonder who has the film rights to produce ""The Eastwood Chronicle"" when he dies...",1245110400,9,3356,4.8927943760984185

7451251,1,B015S4DS1K,"The critical reviews of this Clint Eastwood film had been all over the board, so I watched it with hope but no special expectation.  Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this movie was in every regard...right down to inane ""special features.""  Eastwood is a hell of a director when he wants to be.  I can't imagine what attracted him to this After School Special script with its one-note characterizations and by-the-numbers plot development.

There is nothing to recommend in this movie, but much to condemn, including atrocious acting by the supporting cast, including the priest and most especially the police officers at the end, who turned what should have been, in a good movie, a dramatic ending, into farce.

Not a single subtle, genuine emotion to be found in the movie, the apotheosis of awfulness was reached when Eastwood looks at himself in the mirror and says that he has more in common with these [profanity profanity racial epithet...if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, be aware that every fifth sentence follows that form] people than I do my own family.  That's how little trust the script and direction had in the storytelling--the need was felt to smack the viewer right in the face with the point of the story.

Finally, a word about the special feature...on cars.  Yes, the movie's title is ""Gran Tarino,"" and that's a car, and Eastwood's character had worked in Detroit making cars, and the car is in the movie in a couple of key scenes.  But this is not a movie about cars.  The eponymous wheels are if anything a symbol, but to have a feature about cars attend this DVD makes about as much sense as having a feature on sledding in a ""Citizen Cane"" DVD.

I can't wait for Eastwood to return to form.  He is a smart director and a talented actor.  Fortunately, this is a rare misstep for him.  I can see why he was attracted to some of the messages in the script.  But the clunky, clumsy storytelling is nothing if not Unforgiven.",1245110400,10,1968,4.631123919308357

It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.

This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing ""Gran Torino"" with ""The Shootist"", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective. The film offers humor, as well, an element largely missing in the Wayne film.

7451263,5,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is a gem of a movie that once again affirms Clint Eastwood's brilliant abilities. From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.

Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.

Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.

The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of ""gooks"" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.

There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.

The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.

""Gran Torino"" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.",1244851200,8,3061,4.911025145067698

7451265,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is a great story with a lot of themes.  It contains racism, bitterness, accountability, kindness, heroism, and redemption.  And that is just in the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood).

Walt is a cantankerous Korean War vet who is a recent widower.  His next door neighbors are a Hmong extended family.  A teenage boy in the clan, Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured heavily to join a street gang to which his cousin belongs.  He is resistant, but eventually succumbs.  As an initiation rite he is required to steal Kowalski's prize possession, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino.

In typical Eastwood fashion, he is a heroic tough guy even at 78 years old.  He stops Thao from stealing the car.  Eventually he takes the lad under his wing.  The story of inter-generational friendship between them is strong and very well done.

This is really a great show.  The language and racial slurs are a bit rough so it is not a good one for younger viewers, but it is a very good one for the adults.",1244851200,4,995,4.5852272727272725
7451276,5,B015S4DS1K,"Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.

Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, ""Dad's still living in the '50s.""

Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.

This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.

The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's ""get off my lawn"" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.

The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.

There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.

The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.

This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.

Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word. You may not agree that it is the single best film of 2008 but you'll be hard-pressed to find a film that will make you laugh and cry equally as hard in a span of less than 2 hours.

The final scene of redemption took me totally by surprise and is a sly commentary on Eastwood's many tough guy movies. Eastwood appears to be telling us that self-sacrifice and caring for others are the highest acts of courage, things which can never be found in the barrel of a gun.

7451282,5,B015S4DS1K,"Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran.  GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family.

GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions.  Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic  group  from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict).  Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors.  Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail.  Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food.  Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life.  The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated.

There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.  But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful.  There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars.

7451283,5,B015S4DS1K,"This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.

Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as ""gooks.""  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.

The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to ""act like a man"" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his protg and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.

Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.

I loved this film.  I laughed out loud at times and also felt real emotion as Clint grows to accept the present world in which he lives and winds up emerging a hero.

7451301,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is a remarkable movie. --Richard T. Jameson, taken from the product review

If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.

This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).

My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. ""Gran Torino"" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.

I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.

This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.

This is a remarkable movie--

7451305,3,B015S4DS1K,"This is a somewhat interesting movie, although a little too pat in places. It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.

Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.

There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.

But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.

There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.

With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.",1244678400,2,1827,4.524242424242424
7451306,4,B015S4DS1K,"Clint Eastwood has become an icon, not just for his iconic film roles over the very long career he has had, but also for his outstanding directing. Ironically enough, the movies where he is the director AND main actor, are the ones that shine the most. (Example. ""Pale Rider"" and ""Unforgiven"")

""Gran Torino"" is expertly directed and acted by Eastwood and brings that classic touch that only he can do. His character, ""Walt"", is not likeable at all in the beginning and many may feel that way even through the end. He is an angry man, mad at the world and all of the problems the world has caused him. He is a veteran of the Korean war--a war the U.S. lost. He is a recent widower and his two sons and their families have little to do with him unless they need something. His neighborhood is deteriorating around him. He is a racist, pure and simple, non-apologetic about it.

With all of that said, you might wonder if there is anything redeeming about the character of ""Walt"" or the movie. A resounding, yes. The movie traces ""Walt"" as he goes from being that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who doesn't want to have a thing to do with his neighbors, particularly the Asian ones living next door, to being the same grumpy old man, but mellowing out as he befriends the Asian teenager and his sister next door.

While his own family doesn't need him and views him somewhat as a burden or annoyance, the Asian family next door needs him to help with getting an Asian gang from leaving them alone. ""Walt"" sees a young teenager who has potential and knows that he needs to help him out with some tough love and being like a big brother. The scenes are classic and enduring. The chemistry between Eastwood and the actors who portray brother and sister is spot on.

The pacing of the movie is good and you are never bored. I was always excited as to see what would happen next and Eastwood didn't disappoint.

Many might find the movie as not politically correct and I think that is a good thing. Political correctness has its place, I guess, but in movies, I don't see a reason. Eastwood's character was shaped by a hard life and war and he doesn't mince words and tells it like it is. It is one of his best acting performances by far in recent years.

Overall, ""Gran Torino"" is fine Hollywood filmmaking at its best. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie and yes the title is a reference to Eastwood's character's car which has underlying significance to the story.

Mix equal parts William Munny, Harry Callahan and Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Highway and you get Walt Kowalski. Love him or hate him it was hard working authority respecting men of his caliber that made this country what it is...was? If you are ultra sensitive as so many are these days you might take offense. My wife is Chinese and she took no offense.

I didn't look for any hidden meaning or high moral. I just loved the story, the acting from all parties and the over all feel of the film. It has the solemn approach of Million Dollar Baby and allot of subtle humor as well as lines that cause you to burst out laughing.

7451325,5,B015S4DS1K,"Walt Kowalski is a disgruntled widower, a grumpy old man who despises the sedentary lifestyle his children and grandchildren live, who resents the ethnic intrusion into his once all-white neighborhood, who is angry at the God who took his wife away and the priest who tries to comfort him.  Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.

But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.

GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).  It's a small price to pay, however, for a movie that hits you on all emotional levels: it's funny, suspenseful, and heart-breaking.  There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.  If Eastwood were to stop making films now (and let's pray he doesn't), he could rest easily on the laurels of GRAN TORINO, content in the fact that he has made an American classic (again).",1244419200,4,1502,4.7203065134099615

They began to bond with eachother and they began to like eachother. The boys sister was beaten and raped and then Eastwood's character decided to go out and finish his deed.

I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah.  Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion.  First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV.  I could barley sit the through the thing because of this.  I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie.  Second the whole story is just corny as hell.  This is pretty much it ""Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace "".  The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass.  It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.

Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!",1243641600,14,923,4.106145251396648
7451341,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is a phenomenally good film about an elderly man who can come to see things in a new light.  While I think it is too easy to describe him as a racist, he is of the glib, crusty, irascible curmugeon type.  Indeed, he reminds me of my father - hard-edged and seemingly offensive (some people would get hurt and insulted, to be sure), but in fact with a good heart and natural nobility.  Eastwood plays it with unmistakable charisma.  I marvelled at the skill with which Eastwood pealed away layers of his character, from his crudeness to his soul-searching and ethic of community.

The situation is that, his wife having died and his sons alienated, he is wondering what to do with himself.  He is rude to his Hmong neighbors, but comes to see them as truly worthy people in need of help and nurturing.  His evolution from suspicion and a playful hostility with the Hmong grandmother are totally believable.  In particular, he befirends a boy who is at a crossroads, even taking him to a barber in order to teach him how to trade manly insults.  Their chemistry as it evolves is beautiful, to the point of bringing tears to my eyes.  When his plans to help go awry, he hatches a very clever plan.

I watched this twice and was moved each time and noticed more detail.  It is a masterpiece and an unusual story for Hollywood to do.  Warmly recommended.",1242518400,38,1354,4.5
7451342,5,B015S4DS1K,"I would highly recommend this movie.  Clint Eastwood plays a man stricken with cancer that has recently lost his wife.  He lives in a harsh neighborhood that is multi-cultural.  There is an hmong family that lives next to him.  The mother has her son, daughter, and mother living with her.  Eastwood plays a very racist, ex-military man that is set in his ways.  He has a good heart but doesn't want anyone to know it.  There is a lot of racial verbage tossed around in the beginning of this show.

When the neighbor's son tries to steal Eastwood's character's Gran Torino from his garage in order to become a member of his cousin's gang, Eastwood catches him and makes him do work around his and other neighbors' homes.  The boy is a good kid but was being bullied into joining this gang and really didn't want to.

The gang becomes relentless in their attempts to get the boy to join the gang and eventually targets him and his family for refusing them.  Eastwood's character decides to help.

It's a wonderful personal growth story on how people can change their views by being around other cultures and understanding them.  Realizing that we all are similar in the most basic ways.  It is also a wonderful stance on the fight against gangs and what they stand for.  How communities can pull together to clean up their neighborhoods and make them safer.",1242432000,4,1356,4.615062761506276

In fact, this might be the last time we see him in a leading role.  Sure he was belligerent, prejudice, judgmental, and even racist, but it's part of what makes his character interesting.  He's brilliant and imposing, shocking and so over the top he's often funny.  This is the Clint Eastwood we all remember in a perfect, and possibly final, performance. He's riding off into the sunset in typical Eastwood fashion, snarling, growling, and spitt'n blood!",1242432000,5,569,4.775510204081633

He has no prejudice in his life, he just doesnt like anyone.  Big difference.  He has a name for everyone, even his friends so I personally don't see a racist here, just an old guy that speaks his mind.

7451346,3,B015S4DS1K,"Here we have Clint Eastwood back in action, albeit at a more geriatric pace, giving his all in the role of a disillusioned, grumpy old geezer, having to  tolerate all the unpalatable social compromises that the modern world has imposed on him.  Where once he lived among his own folk, he now is surrounded by immigrants from the orient, with all the physical dilapidation that entails.  His one abiding passion is his somewhat unremarkable Gran Torino (GT) car - a survivor, like Clint himself, of better times.
All this is fine as far as it goes, but when he switches momentarily into the tough guy role, he somehow comes over more as a tough old fart than anything else.  This is really stretching things a bit far.
In fact, bearing in mind that Clint Eastwood, good as he has been in many roles, is not the kind of versatile actor that, say, Jack Nicholson is, does not really carry the character off with the same panache as Nicholson did in ""About Schmidt."" There you had a slightly similar idea of a ""senior citizen"" bearing all the inconvenience of age on his back, but with infinitely more subtlety and humour than Clint achieves. Whereas Schmidt was wholly believable and touching, Clint's character left me cold and unconvinced.
If, however, you are a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, you won't be disappointed - as had been amply attested by most opinions on the film. It has a decent story line, well concluded, but for me it lacked conviction.",1242172800,2,1451,4.67843137254902

If Eastwood is implying that this is ""farewell"" movie than he couldn't choose better one to sign off on.  Yet as one reviewer stated you could nit-pick that neighborhood Clint's character lives in is basically Africain American but doesn't deflate what the movie is about.  Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is probably one of the most complex and ambiguous character that he has ever played.  No wonder that the National Board of Review voted him ""Best Actor of the Year""----and this is from a nation-wide survey of critics across the country.  Like another perennial Oscar best actor loser, Peter O'Toole, Clint may just have to accept a ""Achievement Award"" from the Academy. Anyway, shame on you Academy--it's really about politics and not about quality since how can an Italian comedian (Roberto Benigi) win for the atrocious ""Life is Beautiful"" (probably thanks to the Weinstein's constant promotion).",1242000000,5,1156,5.193548387096774
7451348,4,B015S4DS1K,"I may be one of the few to think ""Gran Torino"" to be an over-rated movie. But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.

Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, ""Crash."" ""Gran Torino"" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous ""Get off my lawn"" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.

As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, ""Gran Torino"" stumbles. I could guess the ending from a mile away, and seeing the previously stone-cold racist Walt suddenly make this kind of turn-about felt too ""feel-good"" to not ring false. Anyone but Eastwood would have made this a car-wreck, but in his skilled hands, ""Gran Torino"" remains a decent movie to watch.",1242000000,,1643,4.566101694915254
7451349,5,B015S4DS1K,"Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is a deeply flawed man...a man seared by all the traumas that have burned him during his many years of life.  Perhaps, the most deeply felt of his traumas, is his experience during the Korean War in which he killed...at least...thirteen of the oriental enemy, some little more than kids.  They were a lot like, or so Kowalski painfully speculates, his young Hmong friend.

This is a tale not so much about redemption [although it could be confused as such] as a tale about the difficulty of interpreting...or judging...a person by his surface demeanor.  Kowalski is in a very real sense, every man, grown bitter and cynical with age.  He is us, filled with the prejudices which...despite all our denials...structure all of us.  Despite this, Kowalski, again like most of us, is a thoroughly decent human being.  He reacts to injustice but, like very few of us, he does something about it.

He attempts to protect his Hmong neighbors from hoodlums.  Unfortunately, one of his actions against these punks results in reprisals in the form of a driveby shooting and a brutal rape.  Disgusted with himself and even more disgusted with the gang members, Kowalski acts deciseively to end the terror and protect 'his' oriental family.  It is, perhaps, not the ending favored by most Eastwood fans, but is all the more potent because of its simplicity.

I enjoy he way Eastwood deals with 'racism' in this film.  Through his character, Kowalski, we see a decent man clothed in the camoflage of superficial racism.  Conversely...and I think there is a 'conversely'...we recognize that there are politically-correct individuals, who would never let an ethnic comment slip through their lips, who aren't decent people at all.

7451363,5,B015S4DS1K,"That's the ultimate question that living legend Clint Eastwood asks in ""Gran Torino"", thematically, perhaps the finest movie of his long and distinguished career. As everyone knows, Eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years, and both the timing and venue of his exploration of The American Character (either through planning, coincidence, or a bit of both) is impeccable.

With the American economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition, retired Ford worker Walt Kowalski tries to keep both his cherished Gran Torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world. With his wife (and most of his generation) having passed on, and immigrants (visible reminders of Kowalski's time in Asia) representing an ever-larger portion of an uneasy melting pot, Eastwood's newest ""anti-hero"" defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism (as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf). Then, suddenly, the neighborhood erupts, as does Kowalski's long-dormant soul, and there's no turning back.

Trying desperately to preserve his way of life, Kowalski comes to accept that America's future will have a whole new face to it. Those willing to keep America great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in Korea, but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood, city, and country. Sizing up the personal character of his young Hmong immigrant neighbor who ""doesn't have a chance"" in warding off the advances of Asian-on-Asian bullying, Kowalski seeks to provide, both literally and figuratively, the personal equipment that this new American needs to successfully assimilate. Just maybe, in the back of his mind, this aging, crusty ""Polack"" remembers that, despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle, immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in America.

With his soul stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings. For the relatively innocuous sins that Kowalski proffers, he's asked to atone with some basic Catholic rituals. But Kowalski has another method of atonement in mind, one that, for someone who professes to be not in the least religious, manifests a very Christ-like demonstration of selflessness.

By the time Kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation, he realizes that ""enemy"" and ""ally"" cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications, just as the meaning of ""family"" is no easy thing to define. He understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul.

""Gran Torino"" is at turns a humorous, poignant, and searing movie with pitch-perfect acting by Eastwood, and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors. It is destined to be a classic. Even the spate of foul language - which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like Kowalski's all across America - does not diminish the significance of this work.

This is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind.",1241308800,8,3266,5.106741573033708
7451364,3,B015S4DS1K,"Synopsis:  Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old-school Detroiter (read:  a white Detroiter who stayed in the city after 1967) and Korean war veteran who lost his wife to old age.  He's bitter with both his obnoxious family (who try to milk him for everything he has while providing absolutely nothing in return) and the world that surrounds him (which is crumbling away in a state of apathy.)  As Hmong immigrants start to populate his area, one such family moves next door.  The introverted son of the family, Thao (Bee Vang), is targeted by his cousin who goes by his gang name Spider (Doua Moua) who attempts to ""make him a man"" through having him commit gang-related crimes.  Thao is pressured to go through a robbery attempt on Walt's Gran Torino, only to be caught and nearly shot by Walt.  Spider attempts to rough up Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) when Walt comes out, guns drawn, and commands them to leave.  Indebted to Walt for sticking up to Spider, Sue grows an admiration for Walt while Thao is coerced by his family to ""work off the debt"" after dishonoring the family with his robbery attempt.  Though spiteful of Thao at first, Walt eventually starts to give him the type of guidance needed to discover his manhood.  However, Spider and his gang are insulted by Walt's interference and carries out acts of revenge against Thao, Sue, and their family.  Walt realizes that as long as Spider is around, their family will never rest and he's the only person who can stop him and his thugs from intimidating them...

I wrestled with what kinda rating I wanted to give this movie.  In end, I felt it was appropriate to give the film 3.5 stars.  Here's why:

Considering that the cast was composed of Clint Eastwood and a bunch of amateurs, the film actually turned out rather well.  It had it's funny moments despite the overall dramatic tone of the film.  Everyone committed to doing the best they could and carried through a certain human element that couldn't be replicated with an all-professional cast, so that was unique in contrast to many of the movies I've seen recently.  The dialogue wasn't pleasant or even remotely P.C., but it reflected the age of Eastwood's character in the film where people addressed each other as such (if you don't know ethnic slurs related to Italians, Polish, Blacks, Asians, etc, you're not gonna learn them here.)  I should also note the ending scenes of the film came as a surprise to me (save the very last one) and left you with the messages of justice through redemption.

However, there was a enough that I couldn't look past to feel the film warranted a higher rating, and that had much to do with being a born-and-bred Detroiter who watched the film.  We're dealing with a city that's 82% black with an expanding Arab community, but featured a primarily white and Asian cast aside from three black teenagers and a car full of Hispanic gang members.  Anyone living near Detroit would also wonder why a Polish resident would live in a predominately black Highland Park while Hamtramck, the next town over, has a significant Polish community.  The plot devices involving Walt's immediate family were easy to telegraph from miles away and just reaffirmed the message that idle hands have nothing to show for their labor.  Also, the language in the film would have came as a shock at first, but eventually became stereotypical and tired by the time the film wound down.

This movie might be viewed as a conservative movie, but I would recommend it to the NRA supporters and pro-justice crowd rather than the fundamentally religious.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who doesn't have any familiarity with the Detroit area because there's a good chance that the movie's charming moments would sweep you away.  I don't know if I'd put it in the same light as other critically acclaimed movies, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a bad film and I could see why many would enjoy it.

7451365,2,B015S4DS1K,"Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen. But otherwise, this is boring and predictable, something you don't usually get from Eastwood.",1241136000,9,903,4.54601226993865
7451366,5,B015S4DS1K,"Gran Torino is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Clint Eastwood is a genius with his fantastic portrayal of a racist old man that you cannot help but love, this movie makes Eastwood a legend in my mind.  All the other actors and acresses were fantastic and I was in awe at how powerful the movie was.  I can't express how great this movie is.",1240444800,4,350,4.117647058823529
7451367,5,B015S4DS1K,"This is an outstanding film, brought to us by a legend of the industry.  This movie has it all: solid acting, great characters, cinematography, pace, and plot.  This film will make you think, and this film will make you feel.

Eastwood is simply great in the tailor-made role of Walt Kowalski.  Like any great actor, he shows you all the dimensions of his character.  At first, you think he's just a cranky old man.  Then, his bigotry is front and center.  Little by little, you begin to understand him and why he is the way he is. Before you know it, you are identifying with, and sympathizing with, a guy who needs love more than contempt.  Of course, he does find his redemption, through the most unilkely of people.

That Clint Eastwood is great in this film should come as no surprise.  The real surprise comes via two completely inexperienced actors, Ahney Her as Sue, and Bee Vang as Thao.  These two most unwelcome next door neighbors help Walt find his redemption, and give him the love and respect he gets from no one else.  Sharing the screen with Eastwood is no small task for any actor, no matter how experienced they might be. These two rose to the occasion.

The details is this film are just perfect.  The casting is excellent, from top to bottom.  Eastwood's son, daughter-in-law, and grandaughter are played to perfection by Brian Haley, Geraldine Hughes, and Dreama Walker.  They are self-absorbed and clueless as to the needs of Walt.  Walker is the teenager you love to hate, especially when she is lusting after Walt's prize Gran Torino in anticipation of his ultimate death.  Haley and Hughes' good scene was when they showed up to Walt's house with what they thought were perfect birthday gifts.  The gifts of a ""grabber"" and a phone with huge numbers to this man who was still so vital was tasteless.  The scene played out perfectly.

The extras and smaller parts were fantastic as well.  I especially enjoyed watching the thugs and gangbangers.  They looked great and were very believable.  The locations in gritty Detroit were just right.  Whatever time Eastwood and Team spent scouting locations really paid off.

Finally, to release this most un-PC of films in hypersensitive Hollywood was ballsy on Eastwood's part.  You will hear more racial slurs than you thought existed.  These slurs are not gratuitous; rather, they define the Walt character and make his actions all the more important.

Don't miss this one.  Highly recommended.",1240185600,14,2464,4.81145584725537
7451368,5,B015S4DS1K,"Finally, this great movie is coming to DVD!  In my opinion, this is Clint's best movie since 1976's ""The Enforcer"" his third Dirty Harry film.  In recent films, Clint has been a little soft and too nice of a guy. He is back in action in this great film that is also a wonderful story!  This movie reminds me very much of John Wayne's last film, ""The Shootist"".  In both films, Duke and Clint take a boy under their wing and mentor them.  There are many other similarities that I won't say because I'll be giving away the plot.  I can't wait to own this great Clint Eastwood film!",1239840000,2,579,4.26605504587156
7451369,4,B015S4DS1K,"Some have criticized ""Gran Torino"" as being too simple, cliched and hurt by the performances of the film's first-time actors.
But this is one of those rare movies that's bigger than the sum of its parts. In recent years, I have yet to see a film that managed to get both men and women to cry. And that it would provoke such strong emotions is not evident until the last act.
It may seem simple and cliched on the surface, and while I knew that Clint Eastwood's character Walt would eventually warm up to his Hmong neighbors, I didn't expect that the movie would also have me, a guy who doesn't cry at movies, wiping my eyes. And not just once, but the three other times I saw the film at the theater. And I heard other people crying at every viewing.
Each time I viewed it, it was just as powerful, if not more.
Walt is an old, bitter racist, who just about hates everyone, including the young pastor who visits him regularly at the request of Walt's late wife, and his own children and their families.
On paper, the story seems simple, but its power is hard to deny. It's part drama, part comedy, part tale of one man's racist surface, but as the credits roll, you realize that the power of the movie, the emotional buttons it pushes, make this a movie that rises above the acting, above its direction, above its script, to make something deeper and emotionally touching than most would have expected.
There are subtle touches and small scenes that any other director would not have folded into the film. And they do go by like a breeze for the most part. They'll have you laughing, smiling or shaking your head.
And it's good that Eastwood's character does not make a complete (and unrealistic) 360 degree turn, as you see in most American movies.
And given what Eastwood has delivered in most of his movies, most notably as Dirty Harry and his various Westerns, you expect a big showdown to come, and that showdown does come, but not with the ending you expect.
Eastwood has made powerful movies before, but this one really seemed to touch the core of many people, across many age groups, and racial/ethnic designations.
On a side note, Eastwood has also done what so many Hollywood studios and filmmakers choose not to do, which is portray Asian-Americans as regular, everyday people, living in America. That's no small feat, as most Hollywood studios go out of their way to not cast Asian-Americans and not show the lives of Asian-Americans. They rather change the race of the characters, even when they're basing a movie on a real-life story about Asian-American people, or offer easy, ignorant stereotypes.
Eastwood only deserves credit, because it's something that should have been done decades ago.
And while this movie may not get much kudos from the snobby critics in the big film world, it has a emotional pull that even some recent Eastwood movies don't have.
It may not have won any big awards, but it's a movie I plan on watching for years to come.",1239753600,71,2963,4.603024574669187
7451370,5,B015S4DS1K,"The Academy Awards have once again ignored another masterpiece by the legendary Clint Eastwood. However Gran Torino completely deserved it, it did however win Eastwood the reviews of his acting career. Both film and performance are consummately sly--coming on with deceptive simplicity, only to evolve into something complex, powerful, and surprisingly tender.
Walt Kowalski is a widower, Korean War veteran, retired auto worker, and apparently the last white resident of his side street. He also racist and agressive towards his new Korean neighbours and his pathetic family.

As the film advances he starts to change his opinion towards the Koreans next door and develops a friendship between Sue (Ahney Her) and her conflicted brother Thao (Bee Vang). The trajectory of this may surprise you--several times over. Eastwood opted to film in economically blighted Detroit--a shrewd decision, but it's his mapping of Walt's world in that classical style of his that really counts. Every incidental corner of lawn, porch, and basement comes to matter and by all means the workshop/garage that houses the mint-condition Gran Torino which Walt helped build in a more prosperous era.

This is by far Clint Eastwood's greatest film. Filled with Eastwood's style of film making and acting. This is a remarkable movie. Shame upon the Academy Awards for ignoring this film.",1239667200,5,1364,5.339534883720931

8734458,2,B015S4DS1K,"""Gran Torino"" is apparently Clint's expiation for all those Dirty Harry right wing bloodbaths of happy memory. In this movie he proposes suicide as an altogether more admirable way of confronting evil. Personally, I much prefer Harry's approach. The essential stupidity of this movie results from a combination of bad writing and bad acting (what else?). Walt Kowalski's family is particularly bad on both counts (especially the daughter). The Hmong neighbors aren't much better. They seem more like transplants from a sixties sitcom than from Laos. The relationship between Walt and Thao sometimes approaches that of Fred MacMurray having a heart-to-heart with ""Chip,"" as William Demarest bellows twenty-first century profanities from the kitchen.

Eastwoods opinion of himself as an actor has always been on the self-congratulatory side. This grim defacing of ""The Bad News Bears"" storyline is really a Walter Matthau movie, requiring an actor of Walter Matthaus stature.  Despite a crummy script, Matthau would have captured the depth and breadth of Walt Kowalski effortlessly. Eastwood's portrayal of him, on the other hand, is wooden and, frankly, embarrassing. He simply does not belong in movies like this, yet he insists on making them, and inserting himself in them, as though he were Matthau himself. At no time did I find myself wracked with sobs and ready to belt out ""Kumbaya,"" which is apparently the effect for which the writers were striving. Instead, I found myself hoping that Clint's orangutan buddy from the seventies would suddenly swing in on a vine and blow away the bad guys with a Mossberg 590A1. Not even Walter Matthau could have topped THAT!!

Eastwood's greatest successes have been as iconic outsiders. He is Dirty Harry, the Man with No Name, the avenging angel from ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider."" His sphinxlike impenetrability is, paradoxically, what draws us to him. The more he attempts to humanize himself, the less interesting he becomes (which is why ""Hang 'Em High"" is a dud compared to the Sergio Leone pictures). Even in merely ok movies like ""Heartbreak Ridge,"" the human being that he plays retains an indestructible inner core that is simply not available to the rest of us, and that core is the foundation of the movie. When he attempts comedy, or chick flick-style drama, heavy on vulnerabilities and ""relationships,"" he fails miserably (anyone wanna watch ""The Bridges of Madison County"" tonight? I didn't think so.). To the extent that Eastwood's movies have been about dramatic or comedic ""sharing,"" IMO they have been seriously miscast.

BTW, it is JUST AMAZING how many one sentence five-star reviews of this ten-year-old movie, almost none of them verified purchases,  suddenly appeared here in the last few weeks, shortly after a couple of negative reviews were added.  Forty or fifty of them!  For a while, they were popping up every couple of hours  like clockwork almost!!  Fascinating!!  (:D)

BTW, I feel particularly sorry for those who say that the movie is realistic in its portrayal of family relations: some families are bad news, but in my own experience, it has been the so-called friends who were most anxious to descend like vultures upon their best pals possessions.  A relation of mine was a very clever and inventive guy who worked in a machine shop and amassed an enviable collection of tools, some of them specially designed and one of a kind.  While his family was with him at the hospital at his passing, his palsy-walsy neighbor, who had been entrusted with a key, literally backed up his pickup to the door and cleaned him out.
