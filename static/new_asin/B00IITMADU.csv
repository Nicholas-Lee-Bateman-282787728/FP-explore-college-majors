Curious thing is that this film is impossible to find in Spain today, The quality of screen is bad, probably transfered from an old VHS, but it's interesting to see.",1502150400,,249,4.813953488372093

8642425,5,B00IITMADU,"When I was overseas in the military during the 1980s, I was TDY to an AF Base in Spain near Madrid.  I had the rare opportunity to have exposure
and conversation with citizens of Spain who were familiar and some experienced with training for the Bull Fighting Ring.  I was astounded to learn
trainees for a Matador in Bull Fighting were boys and men of all ages.  This DVD movie, ""Tu Solo"" by Teo Escamilla really gave meaning to some of the basics I had learned while in Spain.  There is La Escuela de Tauromaquia, the famous school for matadors in Madrid. Tu Solo means to be ready to face death on your own.  This is a coming-of-age film that has actual students for stars, not actors.  This is a controversial sport to some Americans.  One segment of this film has the young boys training to be matadors who sneaked out to the country to go into the fields where there
were bulls, stripped down naked, and used capes to fight those bulls while nude?!  On first impression this appears to be bizarre, but among some students it is a right of passage in professional puberty to come of age as a matador.  Indeed it is legend in Spain that some Matadors practiced this bizarre right of passage as though it gave them a special mystical aura in the Bull Fight Ring which the Bulls recognized?!  Youngsters are gored and injured during training and in the ring.  One of the real values of this movie, by a Spanish producer, is an experience of the drama, heartaches, joys and learning from a Spanish boy's point of view in ages 8 to 18, as they live and breathe this sport.  Remarkably well done with several insights to the daily culture and living of a Spaniard in Spain.",1437004800,4,1672,4.445901639344262
