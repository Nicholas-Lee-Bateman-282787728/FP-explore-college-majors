239342,5,6300185206,"Hollywood comedy barely gets better than this Preston Sturges glory. It's impossible to work out which is better - the wild imaginings and swiss-watch precision of the comic plotting, the zest of the direction, or the glorious playing of what amounted to  Preston Sturges's repertory company of actors pepped up by Claudette Colbert, Joel McCrea and Mary Astor. The gloriously quotable dialogue and deliciously daft contrivances of the story lead to inspired lunacy with the kind of polish to the jokes that no-one bothers with any more. Without wishing to put too fine a point on it, it's bliss.",998524800,,596,5.02020202020202
239343,4,6300185206,"There was a time when the movies were meant to be an escape from reality. Durning the 30's and 40's this was most definitely true. In the 30's we had the ""Great Depression"", so maybe older movie fans notice that movies always HAD to have a happy ending. People didn't want to see a sad, depressing movie. They wanted to be entertained. And, of course durning the 40's there was ""World War 2"". And, yet again, they're ALWAYS had to be a happy ending. It's because of this, that I take a star off and is the only fault of the movie. It all ends to ""perfectly"". Everyone is happy in the end and they all find love and they live happily ever after, how sweet! lol. Preston Sturges comedy in the beginning may make no sense to you, you'll have to wait untill the very last scene to figure out what the first scene was all about. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are a poor,I guess happy married couple. Whom will be thrown out of their appartment room unless they come some how pay their rent. Gerry (Colbert) thinks since things are going so hard for them in their marriage it's time to get a divorce. She feels it's better for the both of them to go their own way. When the room is being shown to tenants an elderly man makes his way up to Gerry's bedroom and sees that people are still living there! After Gerry gives him the story of her life. The man decides to help her by giving her rent money and some over, a lot over! When her husband finds out Tom (McCrea) he can't understand that a man would give her money without [anthing else]being involved in the picture. I was shocked to hear them use that word in this movie. I thought it would of been a bit too much for an audience in those days, of course that's child's play to what's being said in movies today. The next morning Tom finds out that Gerry is going to Palm Beach to get a divorce. This makes for a funny scene as Tom tries to stop her, it's pure slapstick. After she tries to con some men into buying her a ticket Joel meets the same man who gave his wife money and decides to give him money too! Just so he can go after his wife. Now, the whole idea of a woman going to Palm Beach to try and get a divorce so she can marry a rich man might remind some of a recent movie out now called ""Heartbreakers"". I'm sure this movie was seen as some sort of inspiration for their movie. Soon Gerry meets John D. Hackensacker the third( say that 3 times fast!) and he becomes very taken with her and she becomes very taken with his money. He's one of the richest men in the world (It's odd how she just happens to meet him isn't it. It goes back to that happy ending habit in those days). After she and Hackensacker (Rudy Vallee) send some time together she meets his sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) who has one of the best characters in the movie. When Joel meets Gerry there, Gerry lies and says that Joel is not her husband but her brother, and tries to hook him up with the Princess! Now, a lot happens, and most of it is very funny, but, I don't want to spoil everything for everyone. Besides the sappy ending, ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a great movie that will make just about everyone laugh. It's a good choice to start off your collection of Sturges movies also.",991180800,,3265,4.2256
239344,2,6300185206,"The movie is a light frothy comedy, too insubstantial for my taste. There is not much story and no depth to the characters. I didn't really like any of the characters in the movie so there is no incentive to see it again. It ended leaving one with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I got it because of Claudette Colbert but it was way below ""It happened one night"". If this is a screwball comedy, I'll be avoiding them in future.",989625600,3,425,4.325
239345,5,6300185206,"When buying a movie on VHS, DVD or Laserdisc, there's only one rule I'll consider: Is this movie rewatchable? Is it a movie, like The Wedding Singer or American Pie or The Time Machine or A Room with a View, that I can watch over and over and over again and never really get tired of?
In what might be Preston Sturges' best movie (though that's debatable), the Palm Beach Story is definitely one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. If you want to see really cute Veronica Lake in a comedy role, see Sullivan's Travels (though that movie gets slow and a bit depressing near the end, before it returns to happiness).
A lot of previous reviewers mentioned the Ale and Quail Club, as if their scenes were a spotlight in the movie. Quite honestly, I thought the Ale and Quail club were annoying. Thank Goodness their antics didn't eat up too much movie time. The real show stealer for this movie was Rudy Vallee, who plays a stuffed suit with money to burn, with an eye on Claudette Colbert to burn the dough on. Vallee's very practical; very matter of fact, which makes his delivery so damn funny. When it comes time for the movie to introduce the sister of Vallee's character, who's pretty much the polar opposite of Vallee, you'll REALLY start rolling.
Great comedies always have clever dialogue. This movie doesn't waver from that requirement. Colbert is classy and cute. Vallee is hilarious and pathetic. You love watching the characters and you can't help but care about all the characters, which is the mark of a great movie.  Slapstick comedy, clever dialogue, and romance. This movie is definitely a winner, and it belongs with your VHS collection. Once you buy it, I'm sure it'll be one of your most viewed videos.
Incidentally, if you like this movie, I suggest getting The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (my favorite Preston Sturges) and The Great McGinty.",978393600,4,1878,4.656626506024097

239512,2,6300185206,"The curse of the dated comedy strikes again!  I have always thought that it takes an exceptionally made comedy to stand the test of time which is why so very few of them get repeated viewings from me; it sometimes astounds me how watching a comedy years after while remembering how I was literally rolling on the floor with laughter that it barely generates a grin let along a chuckle upon subsequent viewing.  Some exceptions that I still go back to include ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Dr Strangelove ...Bomb"", ""Duck Soup"", ""Modern Times"", ""City Lights"", ""The General"" and ""Sherlock Jr."" and so I should have known better than to expect too much from this otherwise excellently restored black and white film that has been given the usually exceptional Criterion treatment in blu ray.

The picture and sound qualities are both great though and as a fan of black and white films at least these two qualities satisfied me.  The storyline and overall film though actually really surprised me and I have to take a great leap of faith to believe that my grandparents actually found any of this funny.  While I could see where aspects from this film have been borrowed for future films like ""Some Like It Hot"" but I can name many more similar comedies from that era that I found much more entertaining and funny and more rewarding of repeated viewings.  ""My Man Godfrey"", ""The Thin Man"", ""My Girl Friday"", ""It Happened One Night"", ""The Philadelphia Story"" and even the highly over-rated ""Bringing Up Baby"" I found much more entertaining and in that order.  The first 5 named did not even make the list that contains this film that made me risk buying this blu ray i.e. ""The A List: The National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films"".  Really?  Of all the films ever made this one ranks among the 100 essential?  To think that Criterion could have done any of the films I listed but chose instead to do this one really boggles the mind.

Great Criterion blu ray transfer but do you really want to watch this again and again?  Buyer beware!",1460678400,3,2035,4.653631284916201

239515,4,6300185206,"No question, as I have mentioned before in reviewing a series of screwball romantic comedies from the 1930s and 1940s Preston Sturgis was the king of the hill, especially after he started to direct  the story lines that he had previous been doing as a screen-writer. (That king of the hill might be changed to one of the kings of the hill if you include George Cukor and Howard Hawks in the mix and that could very easily be argued for.)  Certainly, although my favorite is Sullivans Travels, in the film under review, Palm Beach Story, Sturges pulls out all the stops in presenting the question of divorce in a very funny but provocative way.

Here is how it played out to show Sturges knew what was what in making screwball comedies with a wry social twist. Geraldine, played by Claudette Colbert last seen in this space NOT being an American showgirl gold-digger in Paris in the film Midnight and Tom her husband of five years played by Joel McCrea last seen in this space in the aforementioned Sullivans Travels trying to get out for under directing silly comedies and doing some social commentary films while chasing lovely hair over the eyebrow Veronica Lake around the country side, are having, well marital difficulties or at least Geraldine is. A classic tale of woe about being promised the moon when love first bloomed and all she got for it was dunning notices and eviction threats.

She is righteously fed up, tired of stringing along with a big idea guy but with no real ambition, and no dough. She was made for better stuff, still had the ability to have guys eating out of her hand, and liking it. So she is off to Palm Beach to get a quick divorce and step up in class. Now for those who thought that Reno, maybe Mexico or places like that were the divorce capitals of the world it turned out that back then Palm Beach held its own, especially among the Mayfair swells. Naturally she has no dough, and no prospects for dough but she does have that winning witty way about her and she is able to get there via the train. A train ride from hell until she meets Hackensacker III, obviously a rich guy played by Rudy Vallee who has never previously been mentioned in this space but who has dough and a yacht which he gets her to go on. And Rudy has a sister, Maud, a sister from hell played by Mary Astor who was last seen in this space leading Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade through many, many hoops looking for some damned jeweled bird in The Maltese Falcon.

So Geraldine and Hackensacker go off and live happily ever after. Well not quite because see this whole divorce thing was a little unusual then even among the upper crust, maybe especially among the upper crust, and so husband Tom might not have been much as a business man but he loved his Geraldine and so he grabbed a flight to Palm Beach (courtesy of an old geezer) to try to woe his honey back. That is where the all play is. Maud is wild for Tom, Rudy is wild for Geraldine and the mix and match play out that way until Geraldine figured out she still loved her Tom. Go figure. Thats the plotline, and thems the characters but what really drives this one is the dialogue, the repartee especially by Ms. Colbert on the frailties of marriage. Kudos Preston.",1456358400,,3234,4.4468802698145025

These movies just speed along.  The madcap getting madder and madder till no sense can be made, it winds itself up so tight that it becomes a firecracker of fun and hilarity.
The Palm Beach Story accomplishes this with so much gusto.  We are devastated due to the unraveling of the happy couple but the only way we can hold on is in the way Tom Jeffers (brilliant name by the way) chases madly after his true love.  He is devotion and it knows no bounds.
Two words that are the best thing about this movie.

239683,4,6300185206,"....but ultimately not as good (although both films are enjoyable and we're lucky to have this new bluray release).

""Palm Beach Story"" will invariably be compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night-Blu-ray/dp/B00MRKX9PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night [Blu-ray</a>] because both starred Claudette Colbert, both were very early examples of ""the screwball comedies"" of the time, and both involved similar situations of marriages gone or going wrong (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Married-a-Witch/dp/B00G9U6UQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Married a Witch</a>&nbsp;in this genre as well).

Palm Beach Story is designed for, and achieves, more all out laughs than these other recent Criterion releases.  It ultimately has more slapstick and physical comedy, with just as much snappy dialog and wit. However, it ""suffers"" somewhat from being stocked with characters you won't care as much about, both because of how they sometimes react in preposterous situations, but also because Claudette's character comes across too much like a real gold digger, as opposed to a ""reformed"" gold digger or a gold digger with a heart of gold. When she does come around at the end, it just feels too forced and unnatural, just as strange as it feels when she calmly decides to leave her husband at the beginning of the movie in the first place.

Does it therefore make for bad watching?  Absolutely not!  Some of the scenes are unique and highly memorable, and there is a lot of innovation. A rather long stretch of the movie on a train that involves an armed hunting club, baying dogs in tow, shooting up the train as they play skeet with soda crackers is priceless, and only marred by some rather offensive depictions of African-americans that was sadly too much standard fare for the time (but for 1942 still seems out of place).

Joel McCRea does a fine job in what proves to be both a leading man / straight man role. Although the movie is clearly more laugh out loud funny than the other screwball comedies of the time, it ultimately lacks some of the sweetness of those other films. Get the others first, but this is still highly recommended and a lot of fun.

Amazon's product description is complete and describes Criterion's extras well enough.  The accompanying booklet insert is interesting, and although the bonus material is worth a watch or listen to once, it's both welcome but nothing worth writing home about. With what proved to be great picture quality on even a big screen TV this is a solid four star pick-up.",1428019200,4,2646,5.434146341463415

239733,4,6300185206,"In ""It Happened One Night""(1934), Claudette Colbert's character runs away from her father in Florida and travels by bus to New York to be with her rich fianc. In ""The Palm Beach Story""(1942) Colbert's character runs away from her husband in New York and travels by train to Florida to get a divorce and find a rich husband. Both films are prime examples of ""screwball comedy"" that was very popular with audiences in the Thirties and Forties. Criterion released ""It Happened One Night"" last year and now has released ""The Palm Beach Story"" their first Preston Sturges film on Blu-ray this year to be followed by ""Sullivan's Travels"" in April. Like the Capra title mentioned above, Criterion has given ""Palm Beach"" a whole new life on Blu-ray which should please both fans of the film and Preston Sturges. According to the liner notes: ""This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from a 34 mm nitrate fine-grain and a safety duplicate negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed.""  This new Blu-ray is a vast improvement of the standard DVD and Criterion has given it a high Bitrate(35.13) which makes for more grain in the picture but does not distract from the viewing experience. The resulting picture is very stable with contrast and clarity very well balanced throughout. There are only a few soft scenes where the clarity comes into question but this may have more to due to the film elements used than anything else. For a film over seventy years old with the original negative no longer available, this is understandable. The Audio(LPCM 1.0 English Mono) has been upgraded too. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35 mm magnetic soundtrack. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum and crackle were manually removed."" As for the plot of the film, let's just say that any story that has two main characters with the names ""Tom"" and ""Gerry"", well you get the picture(Madcap screwball). The two leads, Joel McCrea and Claudette Colbert, have great chemistry together with Colbert especially in top form. One of the best actresses during the Thirties and Forties, her comedic timing is on full display along with her beautiful her heart shaped features. The lovemaking scenes between her and McCrea(she sits on his lap) still sizzle after seventy years and it's a wonder they made it past the censors. Members of the Sturges ""stock company""(William Demarest, Chester Conklin, etc.) provide great support. ""The Palm Beach Story"" is 88 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH.

239919,5,6300185206,"Believe it or not, I had not seen this movie until tonight on TCM. Now I see why all the enthusiasm.  It was absolutely hysterical. The cast is pitch-perfect. But what makes it all work is that fast repartee between the actors that you only see in movies from the 30's and 40's. Think ""My Man Godfrey' with Powell and Lombard and its terrific supporting cast. It's the same thing with this movie. It's all done perfectly. I rolled on the floor when the scenes of the rich deaf ""Weeni King"" hitting on Claudette Colbert came on.  I nearly died laughing during the drunken Gun Club scene on the train. And in a stroke of casting genius, director Preston Sturges selected Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor for co-staring roles. And they utterly steal the movie.  As  brother and sister, third generation millionaires ( Vallee is oil fortune heir John D. Hackensakker III. Get it??) they move about their world of luxury in a ditzy alternative reality.  Astor is in a constant state between marriages and divorces with worthless European counts, but no less man hungry. (She utters the line of the movie with 'Nothing is permanent anymore darling except Roosevelt').  Vallee delivers his lines with breezy comic seriousness made all the more hysterical by his expressions and incomprehensible logic. Now I know where the producers of the 1960's TV show 'Gilligan's Island' got the idea for millionaire Thurston Howell III played by Jim Backus.

I recall when I was younger his famous film unfaithfully yours one of his best which did fail,was to be remade by peter sellers i believe but his death prevented that. I'm sure  of that...anyways here we have claudette colbert struggling in her marriage and make a living. This screwball comedy which seems like a film designed for carole lombard but claudette does well with it. She is probably one of the great american actresses appealing and intelligent and a god actress and the whims of changing tastes ended her career in the 50's..Robert Wagner has some nice things to say about her...back to the film. Her husband is distraught as his marriage is falling apart from intense love after 5 years things seem ritualized,even the romance after 5 years. Claudette soon departs runs away in a taxi and her husband chases after her,on a prowl. She makes it to palm beach and is romanced by a billionaire of sorts...who hates her husband and doesnt want to hand over the $99000 to her ex as an alimony type payoff...and we also have an upper crust british lady on the scene,and william demarest as a minor character...a good screenwriter knows how to breathe life in his films by making minor characters come to life and have a weight of their own...the train scene and fox hunt type antics with the dogs is great comedy. The dialogue is great to listen to throughout the film,you can listen to the talk and forget about the movie..great language and play like interactions among principals. The writer like Colbert and she comes off best in film,one of her best. He does not like the men so much,preoccupied a sthey are by those attracted to their lovers rather than their lovers emotions..and the ending will surprise as much else in this frothy and light movie which moves briskly although with serious ideas about relationships below the surface. Claudette's character in this film is looking for lovers,not overseers or guardians and the men don't always see it..but does she actually see them..",1339027200,,2228,4.787012987012987
239923,4,6300185206,"All the other reviews here currently focus on the purchase of a boxed set of films by the director of this movie.  My comments concern my experience of watching this particular movie only, through Amazon Prime.  In short, it was a kick!

A New York couple who've been married for several years struggle financially, with the husband being more preoccupied with bringing his fantastic ideas to life, than with producing income.  We learn this through the dialog.  Even so, however, the apartment where the couple lives is elegant and well-appointed, and both members of this couple  dress well.  So there is no real evidence of painful poverty which might mar the light-hearted tone.

Somewhat like Lucy (of ""I Love Lucy"") might have done, the wife comes up with a screwball scheme to improve their financial standing.  However, this wife is a lot more savvy and sophisticated than Lucy ever was (and also more fashionable!).  It's a plan so absurd, of course, it's doomed from the start.  Still, she pursues it with vigor, while her exasperated husband tries to run interference.

Her escapades take them from New York to Palm Beach.  Despite having no funds, she makes her way there just as she'd planned: she trades upon her beauty to get wealthy men to pay her expenses.  I don't know if the success of her methods was meant as satire, but I was glad to take it as such!  And I also very much appreciated that while the screenwriter shows how she pulls this off, he doesn't cheapen or degrade her.  Rather, she clearly considers the whole thing to be a lark, and so do the men who're happy to help her out.  (I wouldn't wish for women to return to their secondary status at the time this movie was made.  Nevertheless, the movie's depiction of an era when a female easily held her public space, and wasn't expected to deliver sex as a matter of course, was innocent and refreshing.)

The writing is always clever, with Colbert carrying the entire movie with her witticisms.  She does a terrific job, but is also admirably supported by her screen husband, and by her later suitor.  All the parts for the station and train segment were well-cast and well-played, also.  However, the minor role of the man who spoke a language no one could understand, seemed like a good ""idea"" for humor, but one which never quite materialized.  Also, the brash socialite was to me more annoying than comedic.  But since these two characters weren't on screen a lot, their presence was more of a minor nuisance than a story impediment.

The brisk pace kept my attention well all the way through.  In fact, as the movie began its wrap-up, I found myself wishing that it could have lasted longer.  Due to the crazy premise, the viewer knows from the beginning what the outcome will be.  So all the fun is had in watching the antics which achieve that end.

The set-up reminded me of other comedies of that general era (efforts which may have borrowed from these early movie comedies).  I've already mentioned that the movie reminded me of how ""I Love Lucy"" plots were set up, with a premise so absurd that just about anything could happen.  I was also reminded of George and Gracie, and their stage marriage.  The couple in this movie, like George and Gracie, obviously cared very much about one another, and both couples seemed delightfully compatible.  Thus, no matter what was squabbled about, you always knew that nothing mean-spirited would transpire between them.

How pleasant is was to be entertained without being stressed with demeaning or violent behaviors, done ""in the name of comedy.""  It also struck me that seeing couples like this ""fight"" doesn't cause anxiety, because they knew how to fight without losing respect for one another.  As such, these couples are memorable to me, humorously modeling that oftentimes disagreements are best handled with a light, loving touch!",1332979200,,3871,4.77710843373494
239924,5,6300185206,"I must have watched this movie a zillion times and still find it highly amusing, entertaining and just perfectly crafted. It is quite amazing that the standard of screwball comedy that this film shows is hardly ever if at all found in productions of these days. Don't get me wrong: I am the least to proclaim the past superior to these days yet deem it astonishing that a movie from 1942, i.e. shot a few years prior my birth, has caught me entirely offguard when I saw it for the first time some thirtyfive years ago on TV in Germany where I live. I was definitely younger than (and not older than today) but rather drenched with rock music of all sorts. So, anyway, I loved this movie from day one and still love it enough to make the DVD my favorite gift after having made quite a few VHS copies for friends and family. What more can I say? Get yourself into the easy chair and let this funny movie entertain you too. The dialogues alone make it for me, like when husband and wife negotiate a suitcase at the curbstone with a police officer involved ...",1285545600,4,1056,4.338383838383838

Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor are great as the second bananas, and the rest of the cast is tremendous. Don't miss Charles R. Moore's hilarious explanation of JD Hackensacker's tipping generosity.

239927,5,6300185206,"A definite, certifiable classic.  Impressed with writer/director Preston Sturges's 1941 film ""Sullivan's Travels,"" Claudette Colbert - then at the height of her fame - told Sturges that she was interested in working with him.  In response Sturges wrote The Palm Beach Story for her, thus giving Colbert one of her most popular roles ever - a movie in its day that was, finally, as big a hit as her 1934 turn in ""It Happened One Night.""

In a way Colbert's character here, Gerry Jeffers, is a twisted funhouse reflection of her character Eve Peabody from the 1939 classic ""Midnight"" (a movie, by the way, which did not receive the instant acclaim Palm Beach Story did, and only gathered it over the ensuing decades).  But whereas Eve Peabody was a social-climber only in that she scampered from one locale to the next, searching without realization for Mr. Perfect (who somehow turned out to be...Don Ameche!!), Gerry is a manipulative schemer who just wants a better life for herself.  She leaves her hardworking but financially-strapped husband (Joel McCrea, as good as ever) because she wants to live in opulence, opulence he can't provide.  So what that she loves him, and that he loves her?  Gerry leaves him anyway.  She wants the life he can't provide.  Indeed, the character is the most base Colbert ever played, right there alongside her turn as Empress Poppaea, from the 1932 DeMille extravaganza ""The Sign of the Cross.""  Only The Palm Beach Story is played as a comedy, and with her snappy banter and cute expressions, you never realize that Gerry's as soulless and calculative as Nero's empress.

But anyway - this is a rip-roaring movie that doesn't let up from the opening to the ending credits.  Indeed, the opening credits themselves are a delight - a surreal, fast-paced montage of unexplained situations...a montage that goes unexplained throughout the course of the ensuing film, only to be rekindled at the very end, in one of the greatest ""a ha - so THAT'S what that was all about!"" moments in film history.  The entirety of The Palm Beach Story is like this.  While the Second World War rages (unmentioned) in Europe and Asia, the characters in this wacky film bumble about in a world ungrounded in reality.  The clues are everywhere - for example, what city in the world would buy, let alone build, Joel McCrea's ""steel hammock"" airstrip landing?  But this is just one example of the movie's irreverence.  Sturges excelled in madcappery; he could write witty barbs as good as Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, but he also gelded the dialog with hijinks to match.  The Palm Beach Story is a spoof of the screwball comedies that were so popular at the time.  Whereas those movies featured unexpected and unexplained coincidences in an otherwise ""normal"" world, The Palm Beach Story is twisted to the core.  Twisted in a wonderful way.

So, Gerry leaves husband Tom (McCrea) and bounds off for Palm Beach, Florida, where she can get a quickie divorce.  (How much simpler it is these days, when one can visit a simple website and do the same thing.)  Along the way she encounters a trainful of drunk, shotgun-wielding club-members, a mega-wealthy bachelor (Rudy Vallee) and his jet-setting sister (Mary Astor), and an incredibly annoying foreigner of uncertain background who speaks an uncertain language (Sig Arno).  And along the way she endures a host of baffling, surreal, and hilarious experiences.  At the same time husband Tom sets out after her - his ticket paid for by a wealthy octogenarian who has made his millions selling hot dogs, of course.  It all builds into a sequence of characters pretending to be someone they aren't, culminating in one of the most staggering, ""HUH?"" climaxes of all time.  The first time you watch this movie you'll be shaking your head and rubbing your eyes when the end credits roll, slackjawed by the unexpected ending - unexpected AND unexplained, that is, until you recall the dizzy flurry of those opening credits, ninety minutes ago.

We should all be glad Colbert enjoyed ""Sullivan's Travels"" and let her opinions be known to Sturges.  If not, The Palm Beach Story likely wouldn't have happened; Sturges wrote the film specifically with Colbert in mind.  And she delivers in spades; the lady never, not even once, gave a bad performance.  She was always good, usually great, and here she's fantastic.  As mentioned, you don't even realize how heartless her character is, so delightful and personable is Colbert.  And yet Gerry Jeffers is the kind of woman who would giggle as she carved the heart out of your chest.  That Colbert made the character so likeable (indeed, you fall in love with her just as much as do McCrea and Vallee's characters) is just one more example of how gifted an actress Colbert was.

But then, everyone's at the top of their game in The Palm Beach Story.  McCrea, fresh from ""Sullivan's Travels,"" is dashing and handsome; it's hard to believe this movie was made a decade after ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" as he looks nearly the same here.  Rudy Vallee excels as a mega-wealthy Rockefeller-type who regardless is as nave as a newborn.  And Mary Astor, as usual, turns in a delightful performance.  The rest of the cast is composed of the usual Sturges crew, a host of memorable faces and memorable characters.  Sturges himself - well, it goes without saying.  He was at the pinnacle of his powers, and it's incredible that he not only wrote such an entertaining piece of cinema, but that he directed it with such panache.

The DVD presents a very nice package - both audio and video are sharp.  There isn't much grain and the picture appears to be restored.  Unfortunately there are no extras - no commentaries, no trailers.  But the film itself justifies the price of admission - buy it, watch it, watch it again.  Who knows?  Maybe on your tenth viewing you'll be able to figure out who's who in the opening credits, and maybe even discern the meaning behind those veiled looks the characters cast from one to another in the final shot of the film (slight spoiler warning: it's possible the wrong twin married the wrong twin!).",1260835200,3,6122,4.825503355704698
240018,4,6300185206,"I found it interesting that this film was made in the early 40's when we were still at war.  I suppose the country needed this kind of light hearted entertainment, just as it did during the depression era.  Right now I find it still good medicine as we face the biggest economic downturn since the 30's and wars are erupting everywhere.  The outrageousness of the wonderful female lead, played by the beautiful Claudette Colbert is  refreshingly politically incorrect.  She knows that a good looking ""girl"" with long legs can get what she wants by her female charms and isn't afraid to use them.  She can't cook or sew but is ravishing and not afraid to accept the gifts of the many men who offer them.  Still, she is good hearted and pure in her love for her big, strong, handsome, hunky man.

This isn't my favorite Sturges film but it's still very good.  He manages screwball comedy without going over the top, which was probably not an easy thing to do.  All of the characters are likeable, too, which makes the film easy to watch.  The Rudy Vallee character could have been played as dreadful but he was quite lovely. His ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" serenade is almost worth the price of the film.  Likewise, his much married sister, played by Mary Astor, was so fun loving and light hearted that you had to like her.  There was no malice anywhere!

Gordon Macrae, who shone so brightly in Sullivan's Travels is a little dull here but the rest of the cast makes up for it.  Travelling by train seems delightfully exotic to us these days.  The Fifth Avenue apartment and the Palm Beach house are all wonderfully decorated.  Remember dressing tables with round mirrors?  The times surely had their terrible aspects but this film just shows us the froth on top and sometimes it's fun to have some froth.",1246492800,,1800,4.624605678233438
240019,4,6300185206,"Story by way of comparison, is in the top half of all his movies. I find it better than his two most celebrated movies, Hail the Conquering Hero & Miracle of Morgan Creek. They were made a little later & were rah rah World War II movies, hence their popularity. Before Palm Beach was The Lady Eve in '41. Excellent acting & perhaps his best. Sullivan's Travels was right before Palm Beach in '42 & they are equally good. Both have the virtue of the steady influence of Joel McCrea as the star. In Palm Beach he is Tom. His wife Gerrie is played by Claudette Colbert. He is a broke dreamer with big ideas. She is hot to trot. Her plan is to divorce him & find a rich sugar daddy to finance his dreams. She feigns indifference & boards a train leaving for Florida. It seems that Preston Sturges could get away with a lot more in his movies than the censors might have allowed in the forties. There was plenty of sexual innuendo, adult content & satire attacking wealth in this one. Adultry was implied. First he was subtle. So subtle that this movie has a family friendly air about it. More important he always incorporated a lengthy, absurd, ridiculous comedy scene. It would be madcap, funny, slapstick & even silly. These scenes must have distracted stupid censors. The Ale & Quail Club was a fraternity of old, rich guys. They were on convention from New York to Florida in a party car of a the train. They assisted Gerrie who was broke & without any clothes. The drunken fools were so out of control that their car is detached from the train enroute. Gerrie has escaped to the pullman sleeper & meets the fabulously wealthy John Hackensack III played by heart-throb crooner of the 20's, Rudy Vallee. He's lower she's upper but they get to know each other. You know he's going to break out in song sometime during the movie. By the time they get to Jacksonville & his yacht he's in love. They are met by Hackensack's sister Centimitia, played by Mary Astor. She is a predator & has her heart set on Tom who has persued Gerrie down to Palm Beach. The ending is a bit of a cop-out.

She loves her husband, Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) but doesn't like being poor and he is unwilling to pimp her innocent feminine wiles. The solution? Leaving her husband for Palm Beach to file for a divorce with nothing more than the clothes on her back, she becomes one of the world's best dressed women before she can even set foot in the divorce captiol of the day. (If you know anything about Colbert's movies, you realize she can wear some stunning outfits.) Her gallant husband heads her off to convince her how irrational she is but is surprised to find her stepping off a yacht with a 1940's counterpart to Bill Gates, John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee). So as not to foil her apparently successful plans, she introduces Tom as her brother -- which makes him an all-the-more attractive flavor of the week to a wealthy man's excentric sister, Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor). What is more important, love or money? Find out who ultimately wins Gerry's heart in this screwball romance story.

240026,4,6300185206,"By 1942, screwball comedies had become quite old-fashioned, nevertheless when THE PALM BEACH STORY was released it became one of the top box-office winners of the year, and garnered much praise for it's stars, and writer-director Preston Sturges.

Married-but penniless couple Gerry and Tom Jeffers (Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea) decide to divorce, so Gerry hops the train to Palm Beach to make all the proper arrangements.  Realising his big mistake, Tom follows Gerry but when he arrives in Palm Beach, he discovers that Gerry has already moved on with eccentric zillionaire J.D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee).  Things take another zany turn when Tom is chased by J.D.'s man-eating sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor).  Hilarious slapstick sequences and the rapier dialogue of Preston Sturges makes this film one of the greatest of classic Hollywood comedies.

Claudette Colbert's performance as Gerry is easily one of her best, evoking fond memories of her Oscar-winning role in ""It Happened One Night"".  Joel McCrea, who spent most of his career idling in B-movie territory, is the perfect straight-man to Colbert's comedic whirlwind.  Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor steal every scene in which they appear, with great support from Sig Arno (as the Princess' latest conquest), Robert Warwick, William Demarest, Chester Conklin and Frankin Pangborn.",1141689600,2,1358,5.438095238095238

He loves her and does not want to lose her. He takes off chasing after her to stop the divorce. While en route, she is aided by a gentleman who not only turns out to be one of the richest men in the world, he also falls for her. Mr. Rich Guy has a socialite sister who happens to fall for the jilted husband as he tries to woo back his wife.

So, being in Israel in such dramatic times (my girlfriend is going to leave me) I started from the comedies, the ones I know will be great and will warm my heart.  And ""The Palm Beach Story"" is brilliant, of course.  How many times do you though about the rampant materialism that pervades relationships in North America?  How many times did you see that subject treated in cinema or television?  Not many, because love and dating is one of the great myths of the ""American Dream"", that maintains people subjugated and content.  Not anymore, and we have Sturges to thank for that.  His characters are so honest, so open and direct about why we do the thinks we do that listening to them is like watching yourself at the mirror without self-justifications.  So men want women to be servile and women want men to be providers.  At least some of them.  In fact enough of them to make the others seem like a rarity.  The lunacy moments of the film are expertly crafted and the supposedly controversial end is nothing but natural to this kind of social satire (with the exception of Joe Dante's ""The Second Civil War"", of course).

Preston Sturges wrote and directed this little gem with fast pacing, and lots of little character parts to back up his stars, that help the keep the humor going throughout the film. The generous but deaf Wenie King (Robert Dudley), Sig Arno as Toto, and Arthur Hoyt as the Pullman conductor are among those that make this film take flight.

Claudette Colbert sparkles, and looks heavenly in an assortment of lavish gowns, and Joel McCrea plays her handsome but penniless husband, an inventor whose ideas have never paid off.

To complicate matters, Rudy has a sophisticated and lustful sister (Mary Astor in a terrific performance), who sets her heart on Joel, because she has been led to believe he is Claudette's brother.

Victor Young wrote the music, and Rudy Vallee, the legendary ""Megaphone Crooner"" of the 1930s, sings ""Goodnight Sweetheart."" Always unpredictable, ""Palm Beach Story"" is a silly, wacky farce that is written with intelligence, making it a smart and sassy comedy, with never a dull moment between chuckles.

240102,5,6300185206,"Okay, this is a work of genius.  Preston Sturges wrote and directed THE PALM BEACH STORY, one of the best screwball comedies ever, made (1942) when the they weren't making many madcap comedies anymore.  At least not the type that appealed to adult sensibilities.  Like most screwball comedies it's a story of two slightly mismatched lovers, here caught in the fourth year of their marriage.  Joel McCrea plays Tom Jeffers, an inventor and builder who's having difficulties making a go of it.  Claudette Colbert is his wife Geraldine, a beautiful woman who can't cook or sew and by now feels she's become a bit of a `milestone' to her husband.  So it's off to Palm Beach, where she can obtain a divorce, marry a wealthy man and get the $90,000 her husband needs to build his skyline airport.  You see, she still loves him, and he still loves her....

  The raw materials of comedy are also those of melodrama and tragedy.  A story of love imperiled by impending poverty can be taken down Heartbreak Road, but THE PALM BEACH STORY is filled with more delightful oddballs and surreal situations than any other movie I can think of, beginning with the Colbert character, who makes any number of odd decisions based on the `logic of the situation.'  Problems begin when the `Wienie King' appears. He's a little old man in an oversized coat and hat who's a bit hard of hearing and a bit gruff of manner, wonderfully played by veteran character actor Robert Dudley.  Generous of nature and a fount of common-sensical wisdom beneath his crust, the Wienie King's act of largesse early on in the film starts the jealously and resentment ball rolling.  Like all the secondary characters in this one, though, he's more angel than devil, and his generosity will pay off in the end.  And, again like most of the minor characters, he gets more laughs than Colbert or McCrea, who more - much more, in the case of McCrea - or less play it straight while the comedy froths about them.  Dudley isn't the only funny character, either.  There's the Ale and Quail Club members who adopt Colbert as a mascot for a spell, and Sig Arno as a strange foreigner, language spoken and country of origin unknown, who plays gigolo to Mary Astor's Princess Centimillia.  Astor's man-hungry princess is the sister of John D. Hackensacker III, son of the son of an oil baron and played to comic perfection by Rudy Vallee.  It's in this fizzy sea of absurd to surreal characters that THE PALM BEACH STORY tells its tale of love triumphant.

 What can you say about a comedy that still makes you laugh even though you've watched it a zillion times?  Colbert is beautiful, McCrea is rock steady, and Vallee is a comic revelation.  This one still breezes by every time I watch it.  The highest recommendation for what's, in my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made.

240104,2,6300185206,"I love old movies. They're like time machines. Glimpses into the past, into a world that my parents inhabited.

But the realities of that world never intrude into this daydream. In l942, the United States, having endured over a decade of economic depression, had just been wrenched across the threshold into the uncertain and chaotic horror of World War II.  An easy sell in those brutal times was a variation on the old Cinderella/Prince Charming story. So ignoring the current political actualities and exploiting the great disparities of his day, Mr. Sturges created a fluffy hour and a half diversion based on the premise that some men, as he spares no clich&eacute; to point out, are born more equal than others.

The story line, unstructured and at times befuddling, is a slapdash Hollywood hash job: Having been monetarily blessed by her fairy godfather (Robert Dudley as the Weenie King) Mrs. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) decides to leave New York, her hapless husband Tom (Joel McCrea), and all her troubles behind. She boards a train bound for the fantasyland of Palm Beach where the stinking rich live the high life, (then as now) in a bubble completely divorced from the grueling exigencies of the average moviegoer's day to day life. En route she meets her Really Rich Guy, John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee), who buys her everything. Will her loser husband who really loves her win her back? Or will the licentious Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) get her hooks into him first?

I found this movie to be neither humorous nor entertaining. Rather it was boorish, predictable, and contrived. The most egregious injury was to those people represented by characters such as Fred Toones, the Club Car bartender, portrayed stereotypically so as to reinforce and perpetuate the Jim Crow racism of the day. An insult then, an embarrassment now.

In fact the whole movie is a celebration of a system of exploitation. The Robber Baron descendent Hackensacker is unbothered by the source of his plentitude. It just is. Sturges, who knew only too well where the bodies were buried in Palm Beach, didn't want to spoil the fun by showing us how such wealth is made and supported. This is after all a fairy tale. A whitewash.

Call me a wet blanket but it just amazes me that this kind of tripe could be made during a time of world upheaval, suffering and sacrifice. I think it says something very unflattering about 1942 Hollywood in general, Sturges in particular, and the audiences who bought into this load.

That said, I will allow that if there was one transcendent scene for me it was when Rudy Vallee sings ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" while Colbert struggles with the zipper on an evening dress that Madonna would die for.

A good movie should not only be thoughtful and technically competent, but compelling and inspiring. Or at least funny. Measures to which this old flick hardly attains. I consider two stars a philanthropic leniency. Nevertheless, its redemption, as with many old things, has come with the years, and its value now lies in the perspective on contemporary life that a viewer can distill from its representations of that 1942 zeitgeist.

Both deal with divorce and remarriage, both have some outrageously funny and unforgettable moments.  The primary difference is that the story of ""The Philadelphia Story"" is as smooth and well paced as any film.  The Palm Beach version, on the other hand, moves in fits and starts like a classic car in bad need of a valve job.

Writer/director Preston Sturges's work has somehow faded over the years in general, and that's a crying shame.  His best work, like ""The Lady Eve"" and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,"" deserves a more well-remembered place in history; although he does still have his core of fans, he takes a back seat to such as John Ford, John Wayne, Frank Capra, Humphrey Bogart, etc., in terms of fame.  Sturges really deserves to be mentioned in the same breath, but even those more famous names had mediocre outings.  This is one of Sturges's so-so films, ultimately not as memorable as some others.  There's an outrageous sequence where a bunch of drunks shoot up a train, which finally brings the film alive when it's about 45 minutes old, and there's an apparently European gentleman who provides great comedy relief for the final half-hour.

Other than these welcome bright spots, it's a screwball comedy without many laughs, just odd situations.  It's a case where the always fun Claudette Colbert is better than her material, as are Rudy Vallee and several of the bit players, while Joel McCrea is practically faceless and undistinguished.

240151,5,6300185206,"Preston Sturges' 1942 comedy gem ""The Palm Beach Story"" posits that people are so unused to good fortune that when it's dropped right into their laps, they have no idea what to do with it. And those people include the movie's audience.

The movie begins with a whirlwind exposition sequence which explains absolutely nothing. It's Sturges' nose-thumbing at movies which have nothing *but* exposition. He seems to be saying, ""Must we explain everything from the get-go? Have some patience on this trip, and I'll get you there.""

Soon enough, we meet Tom (Joel McCrea), a frustrated construction designer, and Jerry (Claudette Colbert), his equally frustrated wife. They live in a posh apartment but are constantly dodging bill collectors, until Jerry's chance run-in with a meat mogul known as ""The Weenie King."" (You think that's flouting the censors? Wait until you see Sturges's ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" [1944].) When the Weenie King hears of Jerry's financial plight, he gives her a wad of money just because she's so darned cute. (Once you see Claudette Colbert, this will seem a bit more plausible.)

Far from feeling relieved, Tom is displeased that Jerry solved their financial woes with only a little flirting. Jerry counters that everything in life is ""about sex"" (Note to censors: Flout-flout), and eventually she leaves Tom and sets out on her own, solely to prove that she can get whatever she needs in life just by being a woman.

It's never shown whether Jerry proves this to herself or not. But along the way, she meets some memorable characters: the Ale and Quail Club (headed by Sturges veteran William Demarest); a millionairess (delightful Mary Astor) and her foreign-speaking boyfriend; and a soft-spoken yachtsman (Rudy Vallee), who falls for Jerry even after she accidentally breaks all of his pairs of glasses. All of these people love to talk, and Sturges obliges them with enough epigrams for a New Year's bash.

And for those who think Sturges couldn't direct as well as he wrote, I recommend the scene where a tipsy Tom and Jerry discuss their impending divorce. The scene begins with Tom trying to unzip the back of Jerry's dress for her, and it ends as one of the swooniest love scenes it has ever been my pleasure to witness.

And just when you think the movie has run out of steam, Sturges pulls a happy ending out of his hat that has you laughing through the closing credits. Smart and smarter--now, *there's* a trend Hollywood should have pursued.",1107043200,7,2487,4.90952380952381

240154,5,6300185206,"THE first Hollywood auteur--i.e., writer-director--Preston Sturges here gives us one of his all-time classics that, for my money, is better than Sullivan's Travels and easily the equal of The Lady Eve.  It's pretty amazing to see not one but TWO smart, sophisticated women on the make--Claudette Colbert as a wife fed up with her husband's penury, and Mary Astor as the sister of the goofy millionaire Colbert meets and is, you should pardon the expression, wooed by.
Rudy Vallee, as the mllionaire, also has his not-as-wealthy doppelganger in Joel McCrea, Colbert's somewhat bumbling designer husband who's trying to get a $99,000 project off the ground (actually, onto the ground--it's a huge, ridiculous metal-net for airplanes to land on).  Just as both women have tongues sharper than stainless steel razors honed with eager whetstones, so too do both men have brains that can't quite follow the women's spitfire patter and instead of paying close attention, resort to what Sturges' men usually do--follow instead their male instincts, which means say what they gotta say and do what they gotta do.
Sturges' forte is the uncanny ability to juxtapose selfishness with so much whimsy and foible-ridden thinking it's impossible not to laugh.  Women are selfish in one way, men in another.  But both of them ARE selfish, and therein lies the rub (as it were)--that is, the famous battle of the sexes.  Colbert (Gerry Jeffers) wants a divorce from McCrea (Tom Jeffers) because of his inability to bring in the bacon and doesn't mind it at all when millionaire Vallee (John Hackensacker--gee, I wonder where that name came from...) buys her all kinds of clothes and stuff.
Obviously one of the major inspirations for, among many others, the Coen brothers (e.g., The Hudsucker Proxy), Sturges was a genius for his time, so far ahead of anybody else it boggles the mind. Listen to Colbert deliver a jaw-dropping speech on sex--meaning, not the physical act, but the power of a woman to divert a man. The use of the word ""sex"" to mean that--in fact, the use of the word itself--was without question a milestone (or is that millstone) for 1942, the year of this film.
Gerry calls Tom Captain McGloo when she's introducing him to Hackensacker to assure the latter that Tom is not really her husband at all but her brother.  Mr. H. introduces Tom to her sister Centimilia (Mary Astor) so the foursome--a real brother and sister, and a fake duo of the same ""persuasion""--gaily tramp off together to the nearest hotel.
The amazing scene on the train with the Ale and Quail Club has be seen to be believed, again so far ahead of its time it's almsot a shock.

240155,4,6300185206,"I saw this movie years ago and remembered it with affection as an unfailing pick-me-up. I've just seen it for the 2nd time on telly and wrote my review. In my enthusiasm I neglected to avoid spoilers, so for those who haven't seen this screwball masterpiece, please see the movie first and then read my review! Regardless of what you may think of me, you will not be disappointed by this movie. I dare you not to be charmed.
One of Preston Sturges four or five masterpieces, and IMHO his most masterly piece. The beautiful Geraldine (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are your (seemingly) normal everyday working-class married couple in financial straits; Tom  needs some cash to develop his invention, a suspension-airport-tennis-racket, but this being 1942 and venture capital more difficult to raise in those days, Geraldine helps her husband and does the next sensible thing, deciding to divorce Tom, marry someone rich, and then invest in Tom's project. She hies herself to Palm Beach, touted to her by a helpful cab driver as the second most popular divorce resort next to Reno, ""but for my money Palm Beach is your best bet for this time of year, you got your beaches, you got your hotels."" Tom for some reason disagrees with her plan, valuing their marriage over his fortune, and hies himself Palm Beach-ward to fend off his divorce-minded wife. But Gerry, who's left her husband without taking any money, sells herself to a band of gun-toting ale-drinking millionaires in exchange for a train passage, meets another multimillionaire by repeatedly grinding his pince-nez into his face with her foot (it's all right, he carries an inexhaustible supply of them) and becomes adopted by her smitten mutlimillionaire and his sister the Duchess or Princess Centimellia (oh, it's Princess, she divorced the Duke two husbands ago, or was it three?). This becomes complicated when Tom shows in Palm Beach and is taken up by the Princess in the guise of Gerry's brother, one Captain McGlue (""Captain of what? The Boy Scouts?"" Tom shrieks. ""And why is my name McGLUE?!"") and the multimillionaire, who goes by the nickname Snooty, attempts to befriend him, all the while imprecating Gerry's dastardly soon-to-be-ex-husband.
The plot, as you can see, is another of Sturge's marvelously convoluted structures, and is rife throughout with much of his trademark one-liners (""It is the tragedy of this world that the men most in need of a beating are always enormous""; ""Nothing is forever, dear. Except Roosevelt."") and dazzling design. What makes this concoction the creamiest of Sturge's crop are the wonderful performances; McCrea's stolidness doesn't trip him up as it did in the coda of ""Sullivan's Travels,"" and actually gives his Tom Jeffers a warm growly dog quality I find endearing. Mary Astor perfects her chatterbox heiress performance in this film. Rude Vallee is a revelation as the persnickety Snooty, abandoning his teenybopper-crooner fame to play the role of a parsimonious googolplexaire falling disastrously in love.
And Claudette Colbert, wow. Barbara Stanwyck may be more sexy in ""The Lady Eve,"" Veronica Lake more mysterious and stylish in ""Sullivan's Travels,"" but Claudette Colbert.... wow.
That said, I took a star off because of the sequences of the drunken millionaire's gun club and the black railroad servicemen. I know that the film was made in 1942 and one should make allowances, but the scene where the millionaires are shooting randomly around the train, forcing the black bartender to dance around their bullets made me wince. It was funny, but too sadistic for our sensitivities 50 years later. This goes too for the extended scene where the only joke is that the (black) train attendant continously pronounces ""yacht"" as ""yachit.""
The film's abrupt happy ending was an out-of-left-field delight, and of course made me watch the beginning credit sequence again. I'm not altogether sure what happens there in the beginning, does anyone out there have any ideas?",1010275200,4,4003,5.102134146341464
240156,5,6300185206,"This is an absolutely stunning comedy, with one comic shock and delight after another, and hilarious performances by a bevy of some of the best character actors in the history of Hollywood.
Highpoints include a trip on the railroad with the Ale and Quail Club; an introduction to The Weenie King, on of the funniest characters I know of in any film; Rudy Valee's unexpectedly delightful portrayal of a Rockefeller-like multi-millionaire; Mary Astor's excellent performance as Rudy Valee's sister; and a gentleman of unspecified ethnic origin known simply as ""Toto.""
The opening credits of the movie are among the most fascinating of the thirties or forties.  While the credits are running, we see onscreen an entire prequel somehow involving two sets of identical twins (one set played by Joel McCrea and the other by Claudette Colbert).
Preston Sturges is not the best director the United States has ever produced, but he unquestionably enjoyed the finest five year period of any director we have ever seen.  From 1940 until 1945, Preston Sturges enjoyed a run of amazingly crafted comedy masterpieces that by themselves place him on any list of the essential directors.  In the late 1930s, Sturges built a name for himself by penning a number of first rate comedy scripts, including the classic EASY LIVING as well as REMEMBER THE NIGHT.  Paramount gave him a shot at directing, and he responded with films like THE GREAT McGINTY, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, the great THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PALM BEACH STORY, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, and HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  But then, suddenly and without warning, his genius deserted him.
But this is one of the best of his best.  Just sit back, get yourself pleasant to drink, and have a good time.",1008547200,32,1755,4.9523809523809526
240157,5,6300185206,"Preston Sturges, as a director, had a strong fancy for trains.  In SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, he had a great railroad yard sequence in which an old tramp was killed by a streamliner, and later Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake spent much time in freightcars.  Here, Sturges again picked out a railroad car - a private Pullman to Florida - for a wild and slapstick farce.  Claudette Colbert, fleeing from her husband in New York, finds herself in Pennsylvania Station without a cent.  Here she is taken in tow by the millionaire members of the Ale & Quail Club - who are going south for their annual shoot-'em up and drink-em'-down vacation.  What happens on the train is one of the funniest scenes in vintage comedy.  Rudy Vallee plays the world's richest  man who believes that it's un-American to give more than a 10-cent tip; he was praised by the critics for this performance because he showed he could do more than croon the Maine STEIN SONG, and act ineptly as he did in his early talkies.  As John D. Hackensacker III, Vallee (playing straight comedy) rescues Claudette from the pyrotechnics of the Ale & Quail Club and takes her to Palm Beach on his yacht.  Mary Astor and Joel McCrea also serve this classic film well.",1005350400,3,1216,4.618604651162791

7805729,4,6300185206,"The Palm Beach Story is a light-hearted comedy with Preston Sturges signature traits: fun and fast paced witty banter. Although the movie is not quite as good as his other classics--i.e. Sullivan's Travels, The Lady Eve or Unfaithfully Yours--it is nonetheless a great film in its own right.

Major points of criticism: The screwball comedy elements were not as strong in this feature as in other works by Sturges. The witty banter definitely makes up for it, but it is somehow lacking in this picture. Yes, the Weenie King is a funny character and his rapport with Geraldine et al is pretty damn amusing. But the Toto character is pretty ridiculous and inane, and, in my opinion, doesn't really add much to the story.

Another point of criticism: the use of some of the plot devices in the film (I'm referring to a blatant deux ex machina used at some point during the film) is pretty incredulous--even for a comedy that is somewhat rooted in reality. I don't want to give any spoilers, but, for those of you who watch the film, you'll know what I mean.

Fun discovery: While Geraldine is dining with John D. Hackensacker she orders a prairie oyster--a special cocktail used to cure hangovers back in the early 20th century. I actually had to look it up to know what they were drinking. I wonder when those fell out of fashion?",1492646400,,1328,4.642553191489362
