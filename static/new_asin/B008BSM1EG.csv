5147193,1,B008BSM1EG,"Over all just a bad movie. Horrible acting and bad picture picture quality. Dont wast your time or money on this, it should be free on prime not $3.99",1358208000,6,150,4.206896551724138
5147194,5,B008BSM1EG,"Did you notice there is another movie of a similar title? I checked IMDB and this second movie has been dogging the Heigl picture for years,  getting friends to review this terrific little Heigl thriller negatively. Don't be duped. This is a good little film. Indie, yes, but it does NOT open like the other, cheaply shot on a consumer video, with two immigrant workers pissing on a rock in the desert! Some cinematic moment! Rather than the urine streams of the other flick, Heigl is easy to look at in this one -- with her ring pop and baby dolls in the first part of the movie. Heigl's movie has been compared to David Lynch's Mullholland Drive as a puzzle picture. Okay, not that hard to figure out at the end when it is all revealed, but in that same genre. The single stars are libel, not a real review.",1353888000,6,809,4.357615894039735
5147195,1,B008BSM1EG,Poor little Katherine!  What sort of mess could you POSSIBLY have been in to need money this DESPERATELY?  My heart goes out to you.  The one star I gave is only there so that the bot would accept my review.,1353801600,6,207,4.125
5147196,1,B008BSM1EG,"Stay far away from this movie.  Looks like it was shot for 50 cents.  Boring, hard to get past first 10 minutes!",1349740800,3,112,4.045454545454546
5147197,1,B008BSM1EG,"this movie was terrible.  i want my 1.30 back.

the writing is just ridiculous, unbelievable on all accounts. no wonder it grossed 30 dollars.

how anyone could give this movie 5 stars is beyond me.",1349308800,8,198,4.6

5147199,1,B008BSM1EG,"The worst movie I ever experienced. Lousy on all counts.. Hated it! I would not recommend and so disappointing even the ending was hokey. My husband fell asleep. Wish I had not ordered this one, when there are much better acting and movies that have real content. The ending even sucked, although could not wait for it to be over.",1345507200,2,330,4.516666666666667
5147200,5,B008BSM1EG,"The interesting aspects of the film Zyzzyx Road are probably the suspense that amounts culminating into a series of action packed scenes, where Grant portrayed by Leo Grillo is an accountant that has a wife and daughter whom he loves, and despite this he has an affair with a seductive woman named Marissa (Katherine Heigl) whom he meets in Las Vegas. Marissa's boyfriend Joey arrives and seeing them together he attempts to murder her lover, but Grant gets the upper hand eventually killing Joey. Afterwards the couple of criminals hide the fact that they killed the man, and drive away to a dead end street Zyzzyx Road to bury the corpse unbeknownst to anyone.

The most disturbing part of the film is that there is an invisible enemy attempting to seek out and kill Marissa and her new lover Grant. It may be possible that Grant is simply an innocent man that transformed into a psychopath after the killing of Joey, as if his conscience is biting on him. Grant appears to be a victim more or less of his own mental and emotional problems that he simply doesn't have the stamina to cope with, and he turned into a madman not by desire, but by coincidence and has broken down to the point where he cannot tell apart his enemies from his friends. He is clearly very delusional and appears to not desire to hurt anybody, but does so in the process. Overall the film is excellent, and has the best actors and an ideal location for the fictional Zyzzyx Road, and the mystery that is created holds a great interest all the way to the end of the film. I would recommend the film to be watched by vast varieties of audience, and definitely without question respect the contents and the fascination surrounding this action packed thriller centered on Zyzzyx Road, and one of a kind film, that is the work of a genius.",1342483200,5,1811,4.5552147239263805
5147201,5,B008BSM1EG,I had heard about this movie for a while.  I didn't know what to expect based on its notorious history.  I am happy to report that it was really entertaining!  Forget all the box office spin.  Heigl is great.  Grillo is perfectly cast and the filmmakers used Sizemore's persona to great effect.  If you are expecting a straight ahead thriller-- this is something more.  It's really fun.  Lots of twists and turns and it  mixes genres in a very cleaver way.  When it's all over you should look at it again and you can see exactly how all the pieces fit together.  Great puzzle!,1342396800,8,576,4.4423076923076925

8526660,1,B008BSM1EG,"I didn't see the movie so my rating is totally unfair but I was intrigued enough by the reviews to check out the posted trailer and that deserved a star. Check it out.

Whoever made this movie seems like somebody precognized by Mel Brooks as a model for The Producers, i.e. there must have been some reason other than making a movie that this movie was made; even the trailer reeks of somebody desperately trying to lose money.",1458864000,,427,4.4743589743589745
8526661,3,B008BSM1EG,"Wiki fact: The lowest-grossing film of all time- ""Zyzzyx Road"" was shown once a day, at noon, for six days (February 25  March 2, 2006) at Highland Park Village Theater in Dallas, Texas, a movie theater rented by the producers for $1,000.
The limited release was deliberate: Grillo was uninterested in releasing the film domestically until it underwent foreign distribution, but needed to fulfill the U.S. release obligation required by the Screen Actors Guild for low-budget films (films with budgets less than $2.5 million that are not for the direct-to-video market.)
The strategy had the side effect of making the film at the time the lowest-grossing film of all time, earning just $30 at the box office from six patrons.[5] Unofficially, its opening weekend netted $20. The $10 difference is due to a personal refund by Grillo to makeup artist Sheila Moore, who had worked on the film, and her friend.[1]

The similarly-named Zzyzx has also (mistakenly) been cited as the lowest-grossing film of all time, due to the similar titles and release dates of the films.",1458345600,,1068,5.028248587570621

8526668,2,B008BSM1EG,"Why did they have to change the name? Zzyzx Road is at mile marker 239 on Interstate 15 just 7 miles southwest of Baker, California. Millions pass this on their way from southern California to Las Vegas. I always got a chuckle out of the name and bought the movie because of it. IMDB just says the movie was shot in the Mojave Desert. It could have been shot at the real Zzyzx Road but many remote exits on I-15 and I-40 in the Mojave look like that. This is a poor movie and much is shot in the dark. A motel room is supposed to be in Las Vegas but there are no Vegas scenes in the movie. I do not know why they had to change the spelling.",1358294400,5,640,3.9307692307692306
